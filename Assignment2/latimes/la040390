ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<P>
The weakness of the 1990 federal census is that it really won't give Angelenos 
an idea of how they compare with the rest of the nation in several crucial 
life-style categories. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a Security Pacific Bank study found that more than one out of 
every two residents take vitamins, that 548,000 Angelenos bought backpacking 
equipment over a 12-month period (and 228,000 of them never took it out of the 
closet) and, perhaps most shocking, that only about 10% of the male population 
bought new bathing trunks each year. 
</P>
<P>
So how do we rank nationwide in these categories? Are the bathing suits of 
Cleveland men less worn and frazzled? 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census will offer no clue. 
</P>
<P>
The same with surfboard ownership. And what about poodles? L.A. has licensed 
more than 16,000 of the grumpy little designer dogs. But most other cities 
don't break their figures down by breed, so L.A.'s ranking is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the sunglasses issue. Some manufacturers say that Seattle 
ranks No. 1 in the nation in per capita purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Such a claim, if true, would seem to be an insult to the L.A. Convention and 
Visitors Bureau (or is it Visitors and Convention Bureau?). 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily, though. Seattleites buy more, the theory goes, because they 
tend to lose their shades during the many rainy periods. But we won't know for 
sure. Maybe the 2000 census will address these issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, don't forget to take your vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, the city rejected a bid by local disc jockeys Mark and 
Brian to paint the HOLLYWOOD sign green for St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Someone couldn't let April Fools' Day pass without editing the 68-year-old 
landmark, though. Police said pranksters used a camouflage parachute "and 
twisted it around the first 'O"' to make the sign read: "HALLYWOOD." 
</P>
<P>
A suspicious sort might point out that Sunday also marked the debut of the HA! 
cable comedy network. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that a few months ago "Only in L.A." gave readers an exclusive 
look at the secret life-style of Lassie, who is generally shielded from the 
media by a team of press agents. 
</P>
<P>
Though the dog has the female lead in a TV series, Lassie is actually a male. 
What's more, the collie virtually refuses to perform on camera unless his young 
mistress, Falcon, is seated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the news that a Beverly Hills interior design company has created a 
7-foot-long, 6-foot-high, two-story Scottish manor house for Lassie. No word 
yet on whether Falcon will move in. 
</P>
<P>
The dog palace, a spokesman pointed out, contains "murals depicting antique 
bookcases filled with Lassie's ball collection" as well as photos of his/her 
favorite industry friends, "including Rin Tin Tin and Flipper." 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent, though, were shots of Morris the Cat. She and Lassie 
feuded for years.

BUCHANAN ON FUNDING FOR ART

<TEXT>
<P>
Buchanan's column was a breath of fresh air for the millions of us who are sick 
to death of funding the destruction of our cultural roots through our tax 
dollars. If we allow our Christian heritage and the morality it engenders to be 
destroyed by those with a pagan world view, we will see the United States 
destroyed.

U.S. HOSTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to the story of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon (Part A, March 
16). 
</P>
<P>
On the biography list of the eight hostages, there were two mistakes on Alann 
Steen's background: 
</P>
<P>
1) He didn't meet and marry a professor from a Virginia university; he met and 
married a professor named Virginia at Beirut University where he taught and was 
abducted. 
</P>
<P>
2) Humboldt State University is not in Boston, it is in Arcata, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Alann Steen is my father and I would like to see The Times get the facts 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
For future articles, Steen has a 1-year-old grandson named Jordan Alann 
Scardino he doesn't even know about.

IT'S TIME FOR LINDSAY TO STEP DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S PAINFUL TO SAY IT, BUT IT MUST NOW BE SAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's painful to watch a once-vigorous person become debilitated. Some had that 
feeling recently while watching the videotaped Iran-Contra trial testimony of 
former President Ronald Reagan. Anyone who saw that video of Reagan testifying 
about all he couldn't remember had to be relieved he was no longer the Chief 
Executive. Many Angelenos have that same uneasy feeling now in watching 
89-year-old City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, increasingly weak and befuddled as 
the result of a 1988 stroke. It's time to stop turning away and shaking our 
heads at the councilman's many lapses and admit that it's time for Lindsay to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Lindsay, the first black person to serve on the City Council, has 
represented what he affectionately calls the "Great 9th District," which 
includes the Central City, since 1963. Under his leadership, an atrophying 
downtown was invigorated; businesses once eager to abandon the Civic Center 
instead remained and thrived; new business and economic strength followed. 
</P>
<P>
But south of the gleaming downtown high-rises, the "Great 9th" is anything but. 
It is the poorest section of the city, largely populated by Latino immigrants 
and elderly blacks. It has become a place people move away from. Younger blacks 
go back to that part of the 9th District only to visit Grandma. The first 
chance they get, young Latino immigrants move west, move east, move out. 
</P>
<P>
Tremendous social and economic changes far beyond Lindsay's control have 
transformed the district in the last 20 years. That is all the more reason the 
district needs energetic, engaged leadership. Council staff can provide many 
day-to-day constituent services. But only a council member can vote and 
influence how the city's leadership will deal with problems of development, 
growth and crime. The 9th District -- heavily developed and growing downtown, 
all but abandoned by business and under siege by crime in the south -- is 
without an advocate. Some days, Lindsay is fine. Other days, he's in a state of 
obvious confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Although many have been hesitant to speak about Lindsay's predicament publicly, 
some local African American leaders have courageously stepped forward to start 
talking about it. They hope to persuade the councilman that he does himself and 
his constituents a disservice by staying on in a job that requires more than he 
is now capable of giving. There should be no shame in admitting that. It is up 
to his family, friends and colleagues to point out to Lindsay that he may still 
have a civic role to play but not in the council. 
</P>
<P>
For 27 years, the "Emperor" of the 9th District -- a moniker first bestowed on 
him by Chinatown supporters -- has thrived in the limelight of public office. 
Thus, there is a show business adage we sincerely hope he heeds: Leave them 
while they're still clapping.

BUCHANAN ON FUNDING FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am responding to Buchanan's article in which he criticizes federal support to 
the National Endowment for the Arts because that money is being used to destroy 
a "Christian" U.S. and "re-create it in a pagan image." He states that we 
should not subsidize artists that he judges have "contempt for the public." 
</P>
<P>
Following this peculiar logic, Buchanan's mythical "common man" (I would 
include women in the equation) should be even more outraged at the far greater 
amount of tax dollars spent for weapons systems that are in today's world the 
strongest expression of "contempt for the public." 
</P>
<P>
But you won't hear the sanctimonious Buchanan challenge the military-corporate 
cartel he so fervently serves. He would rather work hard choking artistic 
freedom.

EX-DEATH ROW INMATE HAS NO PITY FOR HARRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Page Anderson, murderer, seven-year Death Row resident, survivor of 
three execution dates, legal celebrity whose case spared the lives of Charles 
Manson, Sirhan Sirhan and more than a hundred others, holds no pity for Robert 
Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade apart, Anderson and Harris committed murder in San Diego. 
Both men were sentenced to die. In 1972, Anderson was made famous, briefly, 
when the appeal of his death sentence overturned every death sentence in 
California. Today, Harris is being made famous as the first person in line to 
be executed in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Though Anderson lived, he thinks Harris should die. 
</P>
<P>
"That was wrong, what he did," Anderson said in an interview with The Times in 
his $80-a-month Seattle apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"He was way out of line. He could have let those kids go. So I have no pity or 
compassion for somebody like that. I can't in good conscience be in his corner. 
I can't. And, if those kids' parents sit there in the front row and clap when 
he dies, I still couldn't sympathize with Robert Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want him to live. I want him to die because he killed children." 
</P>
<P>
The words burst out at a fast clip from the 53-year-old Anderson, his hair 
faded white and his cheeks encased in a full gray beard. The beliefs seem harsh 
and contradictory, coming from a man who once stood five days from an execution 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for opponents of capital punishment, Robert Page Anderson today represents 
a living testimonial that there is some good worth saving in every man. 
</P>
<P>
Released from prison in 1976, Anderson has adjusted to life outside without the 
use of his hands, which were crippled in his shoot-out with San Diego police 25 
years ago. He has tutored preschool children at day-care centers and served as 
a counselor for juvenile delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has become a law-and-order advocate who favors gun control and 
supports capital punishment for those who kill children and teen-agers, which 
is why he believes Harris, who killed two San Diego high school boys in 1978, 
should be executed. Anderson believes capital punishment was wrong for him 
because he says he killed a man on the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the state Supreme Court chose Anderson's case to review the death 
penalty and then abolished that statute as cruel and unusual punishment. The 
Times wrote then that Anderson's "name, like those of Gideon and Miranda, now 
belongs to history." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, he was released from prison. Two years after that, he 
successfully completed his parole. And he slipped out of the state, moved to 
the Pacific Northwest, began a new life, tried to forget his past failures, 
hoped his name would never again be heard by the people of California. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at peace now," he said. "God believes you can rehabilitate yourself, and 
that's what I'm all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the preacher on Death Row said that some crimes you have to pay 
for, but I kept saying I wanted to go home. I told the state that, if they 
would let me out, I'd never commit a crime again. I told them, 'Just open up 
the prison door and kick me out.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was born in San Diego, an only child raised by a grandmother after he was 
abandoned by his parents. In his youth he took up a habit of smoking marijuana, 
grew cocky and, although puny in stature -- only 5 feet, 5 inches tall and 
barely over 100 pounds, roughly the size he is today -- he was difficult to 
handle. He was nicknamed "Rabbit," because he was fast, and because he always 
got away. 
</P>
<P>
At 14, he first went to court for slicing another boy's throat in the school 
gym. He hit another kid with a shovel in reform school. He left school in the 
11th grade, for construction jobs and washing windows. 
</P>
<P>
On April 8, 1965, he shot and killed the credit manager of a San Diego pawn 
shop, then held police at bay for four hours in a barrage of gunfire. At the 
time, it was the biggest police shoot-out in San Diego history. A police 
sergeant finally confronted Anderson inside the building and shot him three 
times at close range with a pump-action shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Although seriously wounded, he lived to stand trial, was convicted and sent to 
San Quentin to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting it," he said of the death sentence. "It's like you've seen the 
movie before and you know the ending. I mean, even a blind man would have found 
me guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no illusion, except I thought they were going to take me up there 
and kill me right away, and that there would never be this seven years on Death 
Row." 
</P>
<P>
Placed inside Cell No. 18 on Death Row, out of the sunshine, his complexion 
paled and, before long, Anderson, known as No. A-91287, was forgotten among his 
condemned brothers, many of whom he befriended and some whose names are legend. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Manson. "Whenever we saw him laugh, we all laughed, saying 'Who's this 
tough guy?' " Anderson said. "He didn't look so tough to us." 
</P>
<P>
Sirhan Sirhan. "He was a likable guy, but he wasn't considered a political 
prisoner. I never heard any bad raps about him." 
</P>
<P>
And Aaron Mitchell, the last man legally put to death in California, who in 
1967 went to the gas chamber with slashed wrists and screaming that he was 
Jesus Christ. "He was a wreck at the end, and he cut himself. But I understood. 
I didn't like what he did. I wish he could have been stronger. But I still 
respected him." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was determined not to go the way of Aaron Mitchell, even when his 
first execution date in October 1966 came within just five days of being 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was close to Halloween, and I had quit smoking, and I didn't have the 
cigarettes to fall back on," he said. "But I made up my mind that, if they were 
going to kill me, I was not going to go in there crying and sniveling." 
</P>
<P>
He began to read voraciously, especially devouring George Orwell's "Animal 
Farm" and Homer's "Odyssey," an ancient Greek epic poem about heroic wanderings 
to faraway lands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd want to get on one of those ships and get away," he said. "I'd want to 
sail to the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
His uncle, William Darnell, sent him $10 or $15 a month and Anderson bought law 
books. He used his cigarette money to buy more books. He wrote some of his own 
court petitions, signing them with a crude X because his disfigured hands could 
not easily grasp a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson returned a year later to a San Diego jail when the courts granted him 
a new penalty phase in his trial because his original jurors were picked only 
from among proponents of the death penalty. The new hearing brought no relief, 
and he was again sentenced to die. Three times he had execution dates, and 
three times courts stayed his execution. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to San Quentin and, by the early 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court was 
signaling that it was ready to order the states to abolish their death 
statutes. Without waiting for federal court action, the state Supreme Court 
stepped into the controversy and, on the urging of American Civil Liberties 
Union attorneys, docketed the Anderson case for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent state court ruling, issued in February, 1972, struck down 
capital punishment by calling it "cruel and unusual punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware that many condemned prisoners have committed crimes of the 
utmost cruelty and depravity, and that such persons are not entitled to the 
slightest sympathy from society," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, it is incompatible with the dignity of an enlightened society to 
attempt to justify the taking of life for purposes of vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson remembered the news of that day. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard it on the radio," he said. "Then, all of a sudden it got quiet in 
there. Then somebody started yelling, and there was more screaming, and it got 
quiet again." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also remembered that he agreed then with the court's ruling about the 
harshness of capital punishment, particularly how the long years under a death 
sentence changed him into a man far different from the one who killed seven 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was cruel and unusual," he said. "It really was. You isolate a man 
up there and take him through all those mental changes just to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you're going to take him one day later and execute him, that's cool. 
But this went on forever for me, and you change. Like a butterfly, you 
metamorphose." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Death Row inmates, Anderson among them, were assimilated into the general 
prison population. "The first week we all got sun tans," he said. "We sat out 
there in the prison yard and looked up and said, 'Sun, eat me up! Eat me all 
up!' " 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1976, after 11 years behind bars, he was paroled. Dropped off at the 
prison gate, with three boxes of books and several hundred dollars in cash, he 
caught a ride to San Francisco. "I got off the bus and just walked around like 
a tourist, looking at all the tall buildings," he said. "Then I got tired, and 
sat right down." 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of people, especially in San Diego, who believe to this day 
that Anderson unfairly eluded the gas chamber. Among them is Allen Brown, the 
San Diego police officer who shot Anderson 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He took another man's life," Brown said of Anderson. "He tried to take mine." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Anderson moved to Seattle to rebuild his life outside the public 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
He earned an associate degree from the Seattle Central Community College. He 
worked as a teacher-trainee at day-care centers in Seattle, reading to 
preschool children and escorting them on picnics in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd read stories sitting right there in the circle with them," said Serrena 
Rock, director of the Love's Nest Day Care Center. "He laughed out loud when 
they did funny things, and the children, especially the little boys, really 
liked old Robert." 
</P>
<P>
Rock said she was aware Anderson had been in trouble, but never knew the 
gravity of his offense at the time. Even so, she said, she has no regrets about 
hiring him because he did a good job. 
</P>
<P>
He counseled teen-agers at the Seattle juvenile hall to abandon their drug 
habits. Don Crews, who was Anderson's supervisor, marveled at how Anderson 
spoke out about the harshness of a death sentence and showed young offenders 
how every life can be worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's done a very, very good job of working his way back into society," 
Crews said. "I really think he has made some tremendous strides. He's accepted 
the fact that what he's done wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
His Seattle parole officer, Orrie Hewitt, wrote a 1983 reference letter for 
Anderson describing him as "an honest and trustworthy person. It is my opinion 
that he is of excellent character." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson eventually lost both jobs. New regulations precluded ex-convicts from 
working with children in day-care centers. And juvenile hall staff members 
worried that Anderson could not protect himself with his impaired hands and 
arms against uncontrollable teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Turned out and unemployed, today he lives on a little over $450 a month in 
Social Security payments. He has never married, and, except for his uncle and a 
small group of friends, has no visitors in his tiny, two-room apartment. Unable 
to work at manual labor because of his useless hands, he has become a 
television addict, a throwback from his long days in prison with nothing better 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't smoke or drink. He said his worst blunders in post-prison 
life have been two minor traffic tickets. His views on many issues seem as 
conventional as the average American citizen. He abhors crime and supports 
capital punishment for the killing of children or teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Anderson rejected requests from The Times for an interview. At one 
point he agreed to an interview, but only if The Times would buy him a new car. 
The newspaper turned that down, but Anderson eventually granted the interview 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
For seven hours in his tiny apartment in a poor neighborhood last Sunday, he 
relived the murder, his years on Death Row and his joy at finally leaving 
prison. He paced about the room, his eyes widening as he waved a steel curtain 
rod through the air, pretending it was the rifle he used to kill the pawn shop 
manager and shoot at police. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm generally right here," he said, gesturing around the room. "I read books, 
look at the television, play chess by myself. I'm not into any clubs or groups. 
I'm a loner. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you see me, I'm going to be myself. I like the quiet. I like the 
peace. The phone won't ring. It will be quiet in here all day after you leave. 
And all night too. And tomorrow."

KROC WILL SELL THE PADRES TO S.D.-L.A. INVESTOR GROUP

<TEXT>
<P>
An investment group of 10 Los Angeles and San Diego businessmen, led by 
television producer Tom Werner, signed a letter of intent Monday to purchase 
the San Diego Padres baseball team, club owner Joan B. Kroc said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement were not released, but sources have set the price at $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The deal still must be approved by the other 25 major league baseball owners. 
Jerry Kapstein, Kroc's son-in-law who has been handling sale negotiations, said 
he sees no difficulties in getting that approval. Kapstein said the purchase 
could be completed within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Werner said he was not prepared to make any announcements concerning possible 
personnel changes until after his group assumes control of the team. He said he 
will seek advice from Kapstein during the transition. Kapstein, who also took 
over as the team's chief executive Feb. 22, said he has no plans to remain with 
the team after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Kroc family has owned the team since 1974. Kroc said she is selling it so 
she can spend more time with her family. 
</P>
<P>
"While I will be relinquishing the ownership of the Padres, I will never 
relinquish my status as a loyal and enthusiastic supporter of this fine team," 
Kroc said, reading from a prepared statement at an afternoon news conference. 
"Being identified with the Padres these past 15 years has been one of the 
special privileges of my life and a source of the deepest pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust that Mr. Werner and his group will do the utmost to represent the 
fans' interest in the decisions he will be making for this club." 
</P>
<P>
Werner, 39, will serve as the investment group's chairman and managing partner. 
He is a partner in Carsey-Werner Co., which produces "The Cosby Show" and 
"Roseanne," two of the highest-rated shows on television. The investment group 
consists of Werner and nine other general partners, eight from San Diego. 
Individual shares were not disclosed, but sources in the group said Werner will 
own less than 50% of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of us has a strong commitment to the San Diego Padres, and we are 
dedicated to sustaining the tradition of this great ballclub in the years 
ahead," Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc said, "From the beginning, I said it was very important to me that there 
would be a local connection. We never considered selling to anyone that wasn't 
somehow bound to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
One of Kroc's considerations in selling the team was that the new owner would 
keep it in San Diego beyond the team's current lease, which expires March 31, 
2000. The agreement among the partners requires that 75% of the ownership 
approve any decision to move or sell the club, according to a member of the 
ownership group. He added that, since San Diego interests control more than 25% 
of the team, any move seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Three members of Werner's group will serve as vice chairmen. They are Russell 
Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive officer of Republic Pictures and a 
former Harvard classmate of Werner's, and Art Engel and Art Rivkin of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkin said the San Diego group came together in December, and it was through 
discussions with Wolfe and the offices of major league baseball that the group 
of San Diego businessmen merged with Werner's interests. 
</P>
<P>
The ownership group is a marriage of Werner's business acumen in the 
entertainment field and the stability of local San Diego ownership. It was a 
deal in which each side said it needed the other. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego partners needed Werner's interest in directly overseeing the 
club, and Werner needed the San Diego group to satisfy Kroc's and major league 
baseball's interest in maintaining local influence with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Werner is going to be the boss," Rivkin said. "We are going to be on the 
board of directors, on committees, be actively involved, but Werner calls the 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Werner said he will purchase a residence in the San Diego area but will also 
maintain his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
He said his work in the entertainment field should help him in running the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"My background is in television production," Werner said. "I run a successful 
television production company, and I feel I know a lot about audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"My shows in aggregate reach upwards of 150 million viewers a week. The 
principles I operate there are the same here: If you deliver people a quality 
product, the rest will come naturally." 
</P>
<P>
Kapstein said the ownership group will have 45 days from the signing of the 
letter of agreement to examine the team's financial and other information. At 
the same time, a committee of baseball owners will continue to explore the 
group's background. 
</P>
<P>
Approval from the full body of baseball owners could come at their quarterly 
meeting June 13-14 in Cleveland or in a special meeting. Approval will require 
a three-quarter vote of the 12 National League owners and a majority of the 14 
American League owners. Kapstein said the deal also must be approved by San 
Diego City Manager John Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, 61, announced Oct. 17 that she wanted to sell the club, which was 
purchased for $12 million in 1974 by her late husband, Ray, who founded 
McDonald's Corp.

37% INCREASE IN WATER, SEWER RATES PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
UPGRADING: PROPOSAL BY CITY MANAGER WOULD INCREASE RATES TO PAY FOR A 
$2.8-BILLION SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT. DEVELOPERS ALSO FACE SHARP INCREASES IN 
HOOKUP FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans' water and sewer rates would rise 37% over the next five years to 
pay part of the cost of the city's proposed $2.8-billion sewage treatment 
system and improve water quality under a plan released by City Manager John 
Lockwood Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Developers -- and, eventually, new home buyers -- would absorb a far larger 
increase of 123% in the fees they pay to hook up a home to the city's water and 
sewer systems over the same period, according to the proposal, which would take 
effect July 1 if approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The new rate schedule would, for the first time, provide single-family 
homeowners with incentives to conserve water by replacing the existing 
flat-rate system of sewer fees with rates based on actual water use. In 
addition, the existing two-tiered water pricing structure would be expanded to 
three tiers in order to penalize major water users with higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"If you contribute less water to the sewer system, you will pay less for 
sewage," said Milon Mills, assistant water utilities director. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood also is proposing discount water and sewer rates for poor and 
fixed-income, single-family homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
On average, however, monthly sewer bills for single family homeowners would 
rise from $17.12 today to $24.41 on July 1, 1995, and water bills would 
increase from the current $16.80 to $22.07 a little more than five years from 
now. The total monthly charge would jump from $33.92 to $46.48 monthly, an 
increase of 37%. 
</P>
<P>
The first of a series of annual 6% increases in the sewer rates would take 
effect July 1, if the council approves Lockwood's recommendations. Water rates 
for the average user would decline slightly before rising at a 6% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the council raised monthly sewer fees from $13.52 to the current 
$17.12. A year before that, the council increased sewer fees by $3.12, up from 
$10.40 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of multifamily units will be hit with a one-time sewage rate increase 
that could be as much as 35.5% July 1, to bring the city's rate structure in 
compliance with State Water Resources Control Board rate-setting guidelines. 
For the same reason, some owners of commercial and industrial buildings may see 
their rates slashed as much as 19.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The increases over the next five years are smaller than expected because the 
city's Water Utilities Department also is asking for authority to borrow money 
to build the sewage and water treatment systems. To date, the department has 
financed construction by collecting large amounts of cash before construction, 
resulting in sharper yearly increases, said Deputy City Manager Roger 
Frauenfelder. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "debt financing" requested by the department would spread out 
increases over a longer time. Frauenfelder said the city's 1.1 million water 
and sewer users can expect 6% annual rate increases, at least through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Bruce Henderson, chief council critic of the $2.8-billion sewage 
treatment project, said sewer rates are already too high for many people and 
worried that rates will jump after 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that there is a big hit after '95 because I haven't seen the 
numbers," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The sewer fee increases will be spent on the $2.8-billion upgrading of the 
city's sewage treatment system to the standard required by the federal Clean 
Water Act, a mammoth public works project that will cost about $6 billion when 
financing costs are factored in. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sued 
the city in 1988 to force compliance with the law, settling out of court with 
the city in January. 
</P>
<P>
The increases in the water bill will pay for upgraded water treatment required 
by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and some expansion of the city's water 
pipeline system. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, developers, who last year saw the council raise water hookup fees 
160% and sewer connection charges 95%, effective immediately, will bear an 
additional 150% increase in the water fee and a 120% price rise in the sewer 
charge over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The water hookup fee, now at $1,701 per home, would rise to $4,252 by July 1, 
1995. The sewer connection charge, now $3,332, would jump to $7,348. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes during what could prove to be a black week in the history of 
the city's development industry: on Thursday, the council is scheduled to 
debate the imposition of huge fees on new development that could generate $1 
billion over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Dillon, president of the Building Industry Assn., said the impact fees 
scheduled for debate Thursday, and others being considered by the San Diego 
Assn. of Governments will push the total fees assessed on many new 
single-family homes over $20,000 each. Those, and the water and sewer hookup 
fees recommended Monday, will be passed on to buyers, making housing even less 
affordable than it is today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just simply going to prevent people from being able to buy houses, 
even in in-fill areas," Dillon said. "We all know you can't build a house with 
a fee of $16,000 on it and still sell it in a price range that people can 
afford." 
</P>
<P>
But Frauenfelder responded that the fees represent developers' "fair share" of 
growth costs as calculated by the Water Utilities Department. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the problem with the system," said Mayor Maureen O'Connor. "The 
developers haven't been paying their fair share."

ACTIVIST SHOWS UP TO HOWL AND BOARD PUTS OFF A DECISION ON COYOTE TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you took a vote among some sentimental animal lovers, they might not like 
Lila Brooks. She has been known to scold them for coddling coyotes like lap 
dogs, ruining the animals' instincts for surviving on their own. 
</P>
<P>
If you took a vote among some bureaucrats, they, too, might not like Brooks. 
She has been known to chastise them for punishing coyotes for man's actions, 
treating them like intruders in Southern California's expanding 
concrete-frosted suburbs when in fact, she says, it is the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
If you could take a vote among coyotes, even they might not like Brooks. She 
has worked to curtail the handouts, the fat-of-the-land living that lures them 
down into foothill back yards, into conflict with pets and humans and, 
ultimately, into traps and death. 
</P>
<P>
The overlapping margins of land use have carried the city out into the 
countryside, into the habitat of the coyote. And, as a result, about 100 times 
a year, the city's animal control people trap and kill coyotes someone has 
complained about. 
</P>
<P>
How the coyote should be trapped was Item C on Monday's agenda for the city's 
Board of Animal Regulation commissioners. It was an issue that brought Brooks 
out of the hills to the downtown meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As director of Hollywood-based California Wildlife Defenders, Brooks is not an 
unknown figure among animal regulatory agencies accustomed to a regular coterie 
of cause-people. 
</P>
<P>
Before governing bodies up and down the state, Brooks has argued for years, 
with some success, for bans on feeding coyotes and other wild things; for 
prohibitions on steel-jawed traps; for watering holes to keep thirsty animals 
in the wild where they belong. 
</P>
<P>
She speaks relentlessly, but not with words like "cute." Her track record on 
legislation, as substantial as a second-term congressman's, results, she says, 
from her cool and logical exposition. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying in a trap as a visual aid, its chains clanking as ominously as those 
of Marley's ghost, might carry some impact, too. 
</P>
<P>
The city makes about a third of its coyote catches with a spring-loaded, 
soft-jaw, padded steel offset trap, and uses a walk-in box trap for the rest, 
Rush says. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks calls padding "just a PR device," and opposes any trapping. But she 
spoke Monday in favor of the Novak foot-snare trap as less injurious to 
panicked trapped animals. 
</P>
<P>
Her speech ran a bit over the three-minute limit. She spoke above the rustling 
sounds as she unpacked from a series of bags a No. 3 Oneida Victor model 
spring-loaded trap, one of the sort she wants banned -- but not the one the 
commission was considering.. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the one we want," said Commission President William M. Putney, a 
veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
"No?" asked Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Putney replied. "We've seen that one." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it served its purpose. "If I set it and put a pencil in it, you 
think it'd break?" asked Rush, with whom Brooks has gone round and round on the 
kinds of traps the city uses. "Try it," Brooks invited. 
</P>
<P>
And in the time it took to put the device away, Brooks got in a few more 
remarks: This trap "is insidious. It should not be used. At all. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks is a one-time hotel executive who gave it up about 20 years ago when she 
"thought it was selfish just to work for myself and make money when this planet 
was so devastated by human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Her tenacious work for wildlife has not made her a lot of friends. Ther have 
been a few death threats and nasty letters. And there are the people whom she 
takes to task when they tell her, proudly, of coyotes they have conditioned to 
come at the sound of a dinner bell. A kitten may get eaten as well, the 
neighbors eventually complain, and the coyote gets trapped and killed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about public safety. . . . They're intruding into the urban 
area," Rush said at the commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks believes "people are the culprits, not the innocent animals." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their dispute, Rush said later that he agrees with Brooks on this: 
"We've been on a collision course with animals and people for years." 
</P>
<P>
His department even makes use of a brochure that Brooks prepared about 
coexisting with wild things. 
</P>
<P>
"We need voices for animals out there and she's a neat one," Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the commission voted Monday not to endorse the Novak trap, which 
Brooks called the "lesser of two evils," if they were going to trap at all. 
Point lost. 
</P>
<P>
But they decided -- given what Commissioner Eldridge D. Huntington called the 
"wide" and "scary" division in attitude "between the commission and you people 
in the audience" -- to take a longer and larger look at how the coyote conflict 
is handled in the city. Point won. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks also takes the long view: 
</P>
<P>
"I negotiate. I compromise. That's how you get things. You can't get 
everything."

CORONER'S OFFICE IS SNOWED UNDER; 
</P>
<P>
AUDIT: THE WORKLOAD HAS LED TO A BREAKDOWN IN CONTROLS, REPORT SAYS. IT MAKES 
155 RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO FIX THINGS.

<P>
The growing number of homicides in Los Angeles County is overwhelming the 
coroner's office, leading to a breakdown in controls, sanitary standards and 
protection of personal property, according to an audit released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 319-page report, which took a year to complete, makes 155 recommendations 
on how to improve the department's efficiency and working conditions and how to 
save $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the (coroner's office) is fulfilling its legal responsibilities, but 
not without difficulty," the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
County Auditor Mark Bloodgood said in a letter to supervisors that the audit 
did not identify any cases where the cause of death was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, " . . . The risk of inaccurate determinations of cause of 
death will increase" due to physician shortages and increasing homicide cases. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the auditors, Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner Ronald N. Kornblum 
said that he accepted all but 15 of the 155 recommendations to improve the 
department. Kornblum, reached Monday night at his Pasadena home, defended his 
department's performance in the face of a tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
"When you compare it (the office) to what it was like when I took over, I think 
it is pretty good, but not nearly as good as I would like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office, with 200 employees and a $14-million 
budget, is responsible for investigating the cause of suspicious or violent 
deaths. The office conducts autopsies on about 9,000 bodies annually at its 
facility near County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found: 
</P>
<P>
* Evidence that improper storage of bodies was contributing to unsanitary 
conditions. In one case, employees entering a room where cadavers were stored 
for long periods were forced to don "military-style gas masks" because of the 
foul odor, the audit says. 
</P>
<P>
"An excessive number of bodies" were stored on portable tables, instead of in 
refrigerated crypts, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum acknowledged that the crypt where bodies are stored is a "bad area. 
There are far too many bodies in there, and some of them stay there for quite 
some time." 
</P>
<P>
* "Bodies suitable for embalming are often not embalmed for several weeks," 
contributing to unsanitary conditions and increasing the health risks to 
workers. In one case, a body decomposed because it was misplaced and embalming 
was delayed for several weeks, auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
* ". . . Routine and major cleaning of the crypts (where bodies are stored) 
does not occur on a regular basis, creating unhealthful working conditions for 
employees." The audit said "significant amounts" of dead insect larvae were 
found on the floor when one of the crypts was cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
* Staff needs better training in identification of bodies. Auditors cited a 
case where "the identification of a decomposed cadaver was questioned because 
the weight of the body autopsied was recorded as being 40 pounds greater and 
the height five inches higher" than the height and weight mentioned on the dead 
person's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
These examples and others led the auditors to conclude, "Adequate controls have 
not been developed to ensure that bodies are properly maintained while in the 
custody of the department. Procedures which have been established for body 
storage and infection control routinely are not followed by employees, nor 
enforced by management." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first audit of the coroner's office since 1982, when Dr. Thomas 
Noguchi was demoted from the post of chief county medical examiner for 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
J. Tyler McCauley, chief of the county's audit division, said the $180,000 
audit was ordered after a series of allegations were leveled against the 
coroner's office, including some that are now the subject of a criminal 
investigation by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Among the practices still being investigated by the district attorney's major 
fraud unit are reports that funeral homes doubled-billed the county and federal 
government for the cremation of indigents, confirmed Mike Botula, a spokesman 
for the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
McCauley said the audit was not intended to be an investigation of specific 
instances of alleged wrongdoing, but a management audit of general practices 
and conditions in the department. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, conducted by the private firm of Harvey M. Rose Accountancy Corp., 
concluded that many of the problems stem from factors outside the department's 
control, such as a nationwide shortage of pathologists and the increasing 
number of homicides requiring autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide cases in 1989 jumped to 2,091 from 1,892 murders the year before. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office, one of the busiest in the nation, last 
year handled 18,019 investigations while its 15 doctors performed 5,804 
autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors also concluded that since the coroner disbanded his short-lived 
internal investigations unit, "the department has been operating without an 
effective means of monitoring and preventing illegal and improper activities by 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
"As presently structured, department management is sending the message to staff 
that the investigation of illegal activities and improper conduct are not a 
high priority matter," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum took over a coroner's office in 1982 beset with controversy in the 
wake of the demotion of Noguchi, who was accused of poor management, loose 
evidence controls and letting his private counseling work interfere with his 
job performance. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of court battles, Noguchi, the flamboyant "Coroner to the 
Stars," failed to get his old job back and is currently a pathologist at 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi had hired Kornblum in 1980 as the coroner's chief of forensic medicine. 
Kornblum, a Chicago native, had been the Ventura County coroner, where police 
officials described him as an excellent pathologist, an evaluation currently 
supported by his peers. 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, however, Kornblum does not enjoy the job of day-to-day 
management of the cororner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a scientific person," he said in a 1989 interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding his administrative abilities, he said: "I've never had any formal 
training. If I have an Achille's heel, that where it is." 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum said that when he became coroner, one of his immediate goals was to 
instill more "professionalism" in his staff and to carry out the duties of the 
office in a low-key manner in dramatic contrast to the razzle-dazzle style of 
his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Kornblum disdains the media spotlight, particularly news 
conferences, whereas Noguchi was known for his colorful sessions with reporters 
whenever a celebrity's death came under his office's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're physicians," Kornblum told a reporter. "We have an important job to do 
and we should do that with professionalism and with dignity and not make a big 
show out of it." 
</P>

WOOD'S REAPPOINTMENT AS CRA LEADER OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH and JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
In a rebuke of downtown development policies, a Los Angeles City Council 
committee on Monday voted against Mayor Tom Bradley's reappointment of James 
Wood as chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot allow myself any longer to rubber-stamp the confirmation of someone 
who is in a position as important as you are," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to create a dense urban core in downtown Los Angeles. Incredible. I 
cannot share that vision." 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted 2 to 1 to turn down Wood's reappointment. Yaroslavsky and 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina voted against Wood, while Councilman Richard 
Alatorre staunchly defended him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that he has been a good chairman of the CRA," Alatorre said. "The 
things that we hold him accountable for, we ought to hold ourselves accountable 
for." 
</P>
<P>
The reappointment goes to the full council for a vote next week. 
</P>
<P>
Wood was appointed to the agency's board in 1977 and since 1984 has been 
chairman, a position he also held in 1981 and 1982. During those years, the 
CRA, with an annual budget of $500 million, presided over the dramatic rebirth 
of the city's central business district. 
</P>
<P>
Through most of the last decade, the CRA enjoyed almost a free hand to plan and 
subsidize the downtown rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Using a variety of financial incentives such as grants, loans and property tax 
revenue, the CRA stimulated nearly $5 billion in new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also helped construct thousands of housing units, many of them 
low-income, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. The CRA also has invested 
millions of dollars in Skid Row relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
A combative leader, Wood often wrangled with critics who questioned his -- and 
Bradley's -- goal of using hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds to 
create a bustling downtown of gleaming skyscrapers and apartment towers. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months, Bradley has moved the agency away from its emphasis on 
downtown, proposing instead that the agency spend more time and money creating 
low-income housing, revitalizing small businesses in poor areas, creating 
child-care centers for the working poor and developing other programs targeted 
to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
"I carried out the mission that was given to me by the majority of the City 
Council," Wood said during one of several tense exchanges with Yaroslavsky and 
Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Wood later told reporters, "I myself am very comfortable with what we've done. 
I'm proud of the Community Redevelopment Agency and I'm happy to go before the 
full City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said Monday that Bradley firmly backs Wood. "We feel 
strongly that Mr. Wood will prevail handily when the entire City Council 
votes," Fabiani said. In recent months, he said, Wood has helped redirect the 
agency toward an emphasis on affordable housing. "Perhaps it takes a while for 
perception to catch up with reality," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action follows more than a year of open fighting between the CRA 
and the council, which last summer gave itself greater control over the CRA, 
but stopped short of a complete takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council has effectively placed the CRA on probation," said Molina, 
who chairs the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
She said there are "serious questions" about how well the CRA has mitigated the 
impact of the growth for which it has pushed. 
</P>
<P>
"People want underwriting of social programs," Yaroslavsky said, "not more 
development of downtown. You accomplished that mission long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you get it, Mr. Wood. I don't think you understand what's going 
on downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Callahan, director of Skid Row's Los Familias del Pueblo, a service 
center for the homeless and poor, said that despite Wood's pro-developer 
reputation, "I have learned how to work with him and he's been very supportive 
of the programs on Skid Row, and I'm actually sorry to see him leave, if he 
does." 
</P>
<P>
But to others, Wood typified what they felt was the resistance at the CRA 
toward helping the truly disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gross, director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, an activist group 
involved in rent control and affordable housing issues, called the City Council 
committee's vote on Wood "exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said he hopes Wood is replaced with "a person who is more concerned and 
committed to ensuring that the CRA builds affordable housing, and does not tear 
down more homes than it puts up." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever occurs, Wood will be remembered for his emotion-charged defense of the 
CRA and its goals. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a months-long feud finally erupted between Wood and an interruptive 
gadfly who regularly assailed the CRA's policies during commission meetings. 
Wood performed a citizen's arrest of the gadfly, William Tut Hayes, 54, who 
wound up in jail last September with a sentence of 155 days for repeatedly 
disrupting public CRA meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes was released by the courts only after Bradley interceded amid a public 
outcry over his jailing. But Wood said then that he "only did what I had to 
do."

GASLAMP WILL RETAIN ITS YELLOW HUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the country's toughest anti-light-pollution ordinances survived a 
challenge Monday when the San Diego City Council voted against allowing whiter 
street lights to be used in downtown's Gaslamp Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Only council members Ron Roberts and Abbe Wolfsheimer spoke in favor of 
granting an exception to the street-lighting ordinance for the Gaslamp. 
</P>
<P>
They also were the only two who voted against a motion by Councilman Bruce 
Henderson to add lights in several high-crime areas -- but not in the Gaslamp 
-- while letting the ordinance stand untouched. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was preservation of street-lighting standards passed in October, 1985, 
that mandated only low-pressure sodium street lights in San Diego. This was 
intended as a way to keep night skies relatively dark for astronomers at 
Palomar Observatory and Mt. Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 60 people who attended the council meeting stood up when Robert 
Brucato, assistant director of Caltech's Palomar, asked for a show of support 
for astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to look at a faraway star or galaxy in a sky washed white with street 
lights is "like trying to listen to chamber music in a machine shop," Bucato 
explained. "The music is there, but you can't hear it." 
</P>
<P>
Low-pressure sodium street lights emit a yellowish hue in only a very narrow 
band of the light spectrum. Because of that, astronomers can easily ignore the 
light they cast or subtract it from images with filters or computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
Other light sources such as incandescent bulbs look whiter to the eye because 
they emit light all along the spectrum -- effectively washing out a telescope's 
imaging capacity. Bucato noted that this has already happened to the 
observatory on Mt. Wilson because of light from the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts countered by noting that San Diego State University, which operates the 
Mt. Laguna Observatory, is asking the city to do something that SDSU itself 
doesn't do. Parking lots at SDSU are lighted with white lights, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and businessmen who testified said the yellowish glow of low-pressure 
sodium lights fails to give people the feeling that the Gaslamp is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, frankly, whether those 16 blocks in the Gaslamp area will be any 
safer with (other types) of lights. But I do know that it will be perceived as 
safer," said Leo Sullivan, an owner of Reidy O'Neil's, a bar and restaurant on 
4th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is the front porch of the Convention Center area, and we believe 
that there should be a light on on the front porch when those people arrive," 
said Michael McDade, representing the Gaslamp Quarter Council and Gaslamp 
Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Gaslamp business representatives said they hope a study by the 
Centre City Development Corp. will find ways to light their storefronts to look 
more inviting despite what they call the ghastly monochrome of low-pressure 
sodium lights. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Hamilton, executive vice president of CCDC, said a lighting consultant is 
expected to be hired later this month. The consultant will look at possible 
changes in the antique-style globes on street lights in Gaslamp, as well as 
storefront lighting changes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 WORKERS OVERCOME BY FUMES AT UNOCAL 
REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five workers were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes Monday while working on an 
80-foot-high converter at the Unocal refinery in Wilmington, authorities said. 
None of the workers suffered serious effects. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, all employees of an outside contractor, apparently inhaled the 
fumes from a nearby heater exhaust that was blown in their direction by a gust 
of wind, said Unocal spokesman Jeff Callender. 
</P>
<P>
City Fire Department spokesman Pat Marek said three of the men reported feeling 
faint, but Callender said all were able to climb down under their own power 
from the 80-foot-high ironwork structure, which breaks down oil into high-grade 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics took the men to Bay Harbor Hospital, where all were undergoing chest 
X-rays and other tests, but none of them was expected to be admitted.

AL MARTINEZ: ASHES IN THE SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the words I dislike being awakened by in the middle of the night are, in 
no special order of distress, "My water broke," "What's that noise?" and "Let's 
go for a hike today." 
</P>
<P>
The first two phrases are hissed in whispered urgency, leaving no doubt as to 
the consequences if I fail to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Either a baby will be born in the back seat of my Pontiac, or a burglar 
prowling around downstairs will haul away everything we own -- including us. 
</P>
<P>
I have not, thank God, been awakened by either of those phrases in recent 
years, though the third brought me out of a pleasant sleep just last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
My wife is an early riser, given to bouncing out of bed to read, rearrange the 
furniture or plow the south portion of our yard in preparation for the spring 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
I, on the other hand, am content to lie there until I rot, untroubled by the 
necessity to stay active. If my limbs freeze in place, I will have a martini 
later and uncoil in the languorous manner God intended for a man in his cruel 
middle years. 
</P>
<P>
But she is not to be dissuaded when she wants to hike, urging and cajoling and 
finally reminding me what Kathleen Turner did to Michael Douglas in "War of the 
Roses." 
</P>
<P>
I realize what she is saying in the nick of time and move my head just as her 
fist smashes into my pillow, leaving me to wonder whether she actually would 
have smashed me had I not moved. 
</P>
<P>
She only smiles and says, "Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
So there we were trudging among the pearlies everlasting in the mountains above 
Malibu, on a day laced with silver. Spring was in the air all right, but winter 
had edged it with the slightest chill. Strands of fog drifted in from the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long after we started that a man, his wife and three kids strode past 
us singing lustily. They were wearing lederhosen, which is what Austrians wear 
to tromp through the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
"My God," I said, "it's the Trapp family. The poor fools are still fleeing the 
Nazis. The war's over!" I called after them. "Germany lost! I think." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just people having fun," my wife said, "a situation with which you are 
only vaguely familiar." 
</P>
<P>
"I know the Von Trapps when I see them. We'll find their nanny on a hilltop up 
ahead, her arms outflung, singing, 'The hills are alive with the sound of 
music. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
"Don't talk, Martinez. Just hike. Be at peace with the popcorn flowers and the 
sticky monkey plants." 
</P>
<P>
It was a day full of walkers. A cross-section of Angelenos hiked on a Sunday 
beguiling enough to raise the dead. This is a part of L.A. they cannot imagine 
in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
A man in his 80s, all muscle and bone, who had never touched a cigar or a 
martini in his life, bounced up the trail with the vitality of a bobcat. He 
even looked like a bobcat. It wasn't natural. Old bobcats shouldn't bounce 
uphill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something for an old columnist," my wife said, gesturing. 
</P>
<P>
Two young women came down the trail. They were wearing bikinis that barely 
covered their primary erogenous zones. The universe reeled. 
</P>
<P>
"If staring were a felony," she said, "you'd be doing life plus 99." 
</P>
<P>
"It beats looking at the sticky monkey plants," I said. 
</P>
<P>
We reached the top of a knoll. 
</P>
<P>
A field of wild flowers stretched below us, clustered among the chaparral like 
brush strokes of glowing pastels. Pinks, whites, lavenders, golden yellows and 
deep reds, sloping in carpets of color toward the gleaming Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"Look familiar?" my wife asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Ashes in the Rain," I said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the title I had given a column and later a book of collected essays. 
This was the place that had inspired both, a hillside once scorched by fire 
then reborn in the vibrant colors of spring a year later. 
</P>
<P>
"The purple phacelias," I said, touching a flower and remembering the brilliant 
purple that had pushed up through the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"Close but no cigar," she said. "Those are fiesta flowers." 
</P>
<P>
"They sure look like phacelias." 
</P>
<P>
"They look like fiesta flowers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. We discovered the wonders of spring at every turn. Shooting 
stars. Hummingbird sage. Wild morning glorys. They were colors no painter could 
ever re-create. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't you glad you came?" my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
I shrugged. Never admit happiness. 
</P>
<P>
On the way back, we came upon the old bobcat lying on his back, smiling at the 
sky. He must have seen the girls in the bikinis bounce by. 
</P>
<P>
Requiescat in pace, old bobcat. There among the phacelias.

A corporate jet caught fire Monday after falling 50 feet at takeoff and 
skidding off a runway at Palomar Airport, an airport official said. The two 
pilots in the plane escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft was 50 feet in the air when it veered to the right, then to the 
left, and then to the right again," said tower manager Duane Rakotz. "It 
tilted, and the wing hooked in the dirt, and the aircraft slid for about 2,000 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Rakotz said a fire erupted from one of the Lear-35 jet's engines. Carlsbad 
firefighters put the flames out. The Federal Aviation Administration is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
An airport employee, Jackie Warner, said there were "lots of flames and smoke. 
We didn't expect the pilots to just walk away." 
</P>
<P>
The pilots are employees of Flight International, a company that contracts with 
the Navy to perform training missions. The names of the pilots will be 
disclosed today, officials said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista Superior Court judge on Monday ordered two Carlsbad men to stand trial 
May 22 for the alleged January abduction of an undocumented alien outside the 
Country Store market on El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Ryberg, a baker at the store operated by his brother, Rick, and William 
Zimmerman, a self-employed meat cutter there, have been charged with felony 
false imprisonment in the purported abduction of Candido Gayosso Salas, a 
migrant laborer from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Gayosso was waiting for day labor outside the rural market when the two men 
allegedly dragged him behind the store and handcuffed him to a railing for more 
than two hours. Before releasing him, the men bound Gayosso with duct tape and 
fastened a bag over his head with a clown's face and the phrase "No Mas Aqui," 
which in Spanish roughly means "Don't Come Back." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the attack was intended as a message to the scores of migrant 
laborers who wait outside the store each morning to solicit work. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing last month, Municipal Judge Michael Burley 
dismissed a civil rights charge against the men. The case is being monitored by 
the FBI and U.S. Justice Department for possible further charges. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions have continued to rise outside the store since the charges. Recently, 
North County migrant advocates charged that the Country Store has refused to 
allow some migrant workers to use public telephones outside the store, which 
they claim is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Prager will preside over the trial, which will call several 
migrant laborers to testify about incidents outside the store, on a rural 
stretch of El Camino Real a few miles south of California 78.

Twenty-three people, including 12 students, were arrested Monday aftear a 
six-month undercover drug investigation at Point Loma and Mission Bay high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Police are searching for 18 others. 
</P>
<P>
In all, police have identified 41 people who they say sold narcotics to two 
undercover officers who had been posing as students since September. 
</P>
<P>
Of those who police said sold drugs, 23 are minors and 18 are adults. The 35 
males and six females range in age from 14 to 63. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on their criminal history, minors will be detained in Juvenile Hall 
or released to their parents, and the adults will be booked in County Jail on 
suspicion of selling drugs, said Police Lt. Skip DiCerchio. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those arrested Monday were on campus at 8 a.m. and were taken into 
custody for selling cocaine, LSD, marijuana and methamphetamine, DiCerchio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Six students were picked up at Mission Bay High School in Pacific Beach, said 
Principal Barbara Thomas. Police were looking for 12 students, but five had 
transferred and one was absent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Petersen, San Diego Unified School District legal adviser, said six 
students were arrested at Point Loma High School. 
</P>
<P>
She said school officials approved the undercover operation because of 
increased drug trafficking at the schools. It was the 15th such operation 
conducted at district high schools since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Trost, a school district spokeswoman, said the undercover operation was 
the first at Mission Bay. In 1985, 22 students were arrested in a similar 
operation at Point Loma.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLACK REAPPLIES FOR ELKS LODGE MEMBERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black man who was twice denied membership last year in the Van Nuys Elks 
Lodge, bringing on a state civil rights investigation, said Monday he has 
reapplied for admission to the fraternal organization without the political 
connections he blamed for the failure of his first two attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Montgomery, 68, of Pacoima, said he sent an application last week to 
a lodge member who agreed to sponsor him. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery and another black applicant were sponsored in September by Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana). Their rejections brought on accusations that the lodge's 
admissions policies were racially biased, which became the subject of an 
investigation by the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Lodge members said the applicants were rejected because many members resented 
Robbins' involvement. Earlier this year, the lodge admitted two other blacks, 
which lodge members said proved their policies were not biased.

<P>
The polls open at 7 a.m. today in Beverly Hills for a City Council election in 
which Trisha Roth, an anti-alcohol activist, is challenging incumbents Max 
Salter and Robert K. Tanenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Roth, a non-practicing pediatrician with little experience 
in city affairs, called for an accounting of the cost overruns in construction 
of the Beverly Hills Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Originally estimated to cost about $36 million, the Civic Center is now 
expected to cost more than $90 million. 
</P>

The campaigns of Salter and Tanenbaum have focused on the incumbents' efforts 
to secure extra financing for the city's schools, which were hit by a teacher's 
strike last year and may be facing budget cuts.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN'T ELIMINATE 6TH GRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel ruled Friday that the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Unified School District cannot eliminate the sixth grade at 
two elementary schools and allow fifth-graders to transfer to the school of 
their choice next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The district wanted to close sixth-grade classes at Mira Catalina and Rancho 
Vista elementary schools, allowing the students to attend either Ridgecrest or 
Malaga Cove intermediate schools or Miraleste High School, where a sixth grade 
would have been created. The judge said the plan conflicts with her 1988 ruling 
barring the district from making changes until an environmental impact report 
is completed.

LAND LEASE IS OKD FOR HOMELESS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $732,000 day center for homeless men cleared its last hurdle Monday when the 
San Diego City Council approved a lease of 25,000 square feet from the 
California Department of Transportation and authorized Episcopal Community 
Services to run the home. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to name the center, at 17th Street between K and L 
streets, for political activist and homeless advocate Neil Good, who died last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It will provide showers, haircuts, mail and message pickup, storage lockers, 
laundry, public telephones, referrals to homeless shelters and counseling from 
early morning until early evening. About 100 people will be accommodated within 
the 4,300-square-foot building, and another 100 will be able to lounge on its 
fenced-in lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Opening of the center, now scheduled for around Thanksgiving, had been delayed 
by lease negotiations with Caltrans. Under the terms of the lease, the city 
will pay the state agency $1 per month for the land and a $500 "lease 
administration fee." 
</P>
<P>
Financed with money from the city, the county, the San Diego Unified Port 
District, the Centre City Development Corp. and private contributions, the 
complex is envisioned as a way of getting homeless people -- primarily men -- 
off downtown streets during the day.

U.S. SUPPORTS NURSE IN ENGLISH-ONLY SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: THE FEDERAL EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY SEEKS TO JOIN FILIPINA'S 
CLAIM THAT A POMONA HOSPITAL BARS SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGES AT WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Monday it is seeking 
to join the civil rights lawsuit of a Filipina nurse who has accused a Pomona 
hospital of requiring nurses to speak only English at work. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary investigation, the commission filed a motion Monday to 
intervene in the suit filed last July by Adelaida (Aida) Dimaranan, a nurse for 
12 years at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to send the message that English-only rules are very important 
to the commission, especially when they tread upon the rights of employees," 
said EEOC attorney Robert T. Olmos, who filed the motion in U.S. District Court 
in Los Angeles. Such rules "create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation and 
intimidation based on national origin." 
</P>
<P>
Dimaranan contends that the hospital has an informal English-only policy that 
prevents Filipina nurses in the maternity and child services ward from speaking 
their native Tagalog while on breaks, in the cafeteria or on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials, however, say they have no such policy and point to a letter 
the hospital president, Robert W. Burwell, sent to employees saying they could 
speak other languages on the job if doing so did not disrupt patient care. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Elek, a hospital spokeswoman, said she was "puzzled" by the EEOC's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said all along that people can speak whatever language they're 
comfortable with," Elek said. "We have continually expressed that we view the 
multilingual skills as an asset." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit, 399-bed hospital serves an ethnically mixed neighborhood of 
Latinos, blacks and Anglos in north Pomona. About 100 of its 2,100 employees 
are Filipino, Elek said. According to Dimaranan, about half of the 14 maternity 
nurses working the evening shift are Filipina. 
</P>
<P>
Dimaranan's attorneys argue that the president's letter was vaguely worded and 
has not prevented supervisors from exercising subtle discrimination so nurses 
will be reluctant to speak anything but English. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated March 24, 1989, does not specify the conditions under which 
employees may speak languages other than English, and makes no mention of how 
the policy is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it's not written down, sometimes they'll enforce it, sometimes it's 
not enforced," said Kathryn K. Imahara, an attorney with the Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center, which, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California, is representing Dimaranan. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Dimaranan, 46, of Rowland Heights, claims that two supervisors 
in the maternity unit told her and other nurses that the speaking of Tagalog 
was forbidden "at any time or any place." The supervisors did not explain why 
the policy was necessary or tell them what disciplinary actions would be taken 
if Tagalog was used in the workplace, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Dimaranan said the warning came in 1988 after another nurse overheard her 
talking to her mother in Tagalog over the telephone, and reported Dimaranan to 
the head nurse. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed with the EEOC last September, Dimaranan accused the 
hospital of demoting her in retaliation for filing the lawsuit. She was 
transferred from assistant head nurse of the maternity unit to a staff position 
in the emergency ward. 
</P>
<P>
Elek said Dimaranan was reassigned "because her technical skills would be 
better utilized. This is actually a case of one employee's performance, not 
discrimination or retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
If the EEOC's motion to join the lawsuit is granted in federal court, the 
commission would be allowed to conduct depositions and to present witnesses 
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Federal labor codes allow employers to establish English-only language policies 
when they can show that the rule is justified in the normal course of doing 
business. The employer must inform workers of the circumstances under which 
they must use only English, and the consequences of violating the policy.

LOPEZ DUMP EMISSIONS PLAN CALLED INADEQUATE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL: A TOUR OF LOPEZ CANYON REVEALED CONCENTRATED POCKETS OF METHANE GAS. 
THE CITY IS ASKING THAT LIMITS ON EMISSIONS BE RELAXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City of Los Angeles and local air pollution officials have quietly agreed that 
a plan approved in 1988 to limit methane gas emissions from the Lopez Canyon 
dump in Lake View Terrace is inadequate, and more costly steps need to be 
taken, records showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The city, meanwhile, is asking that limits on methane emissions be relaxed 
until it is capable of meeting the standards. 
</P>
<P>
The need to revise the gas control plan was revealed in documents the city 
filed March 21 asking the South Coast Air Quality Management District to 
suspend enforcement of its rules regulating methane emissions at the city-owned 
Lopez Canyon landfill, where 4,000 tons of garbage are dumped daily. 
</P>
<P>
Attached to the exemption application was a warning issued to the city March 1 
by an air district inspector. The inspector said that a three-hour tour of 
Lopez Canyon revealed concentrated pockets of methane -- the flammable, 
explosive and often smelly gas produced by rotting garbage and other biological 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector said he found "many" areas where methane readings exceeded 10,000 
parts per million, 20 times the air district's limit of 500. City equipment for 
measuring the gas also was found to be faulty, registering emissions 
"significantly" below the real amounts, the inspector's report related. 
</P>
<P>
In light of such continuing problems, the city soon will seek the air 
district's permission to drill up to 200 more gas collection wells at the 
landfill, according to the documents filed with the air district. 
</P>
<P>
Mal Toy, a top official with the city's Bureau of Sanitation, said recently the 
city will install as many wells as it takes to control the problem. The wells 
pipe the gas from underground, where it forms, to the surface, where it can be 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current plan for limiting methane gas problems at the dump -- 
approved by the air district in February, 1988 -- calls for only 43 wells. 
Thirty of the 43 wells have been installed, using six miles of pipe. 
</P>
<P>
"We've informed the city that more wells need to be installed in the canyon," 
said Moshen Nazemi, an air district supervising engineer who deals with 
landfill-related air pollution problems. "Nobody knows exactly how many more 
are needed. It's not a simple plug-in-the-numbers type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the air district believes the city must dig gas collection wells deeper 
into the canyon's 1,700-foot deep mound of garbage, Nazemi said. This might 
require the city to hire private contractors because city crews are not 
equipped to dig deep wells, Nazemi said. 
</P>
<P>
Installing the additional wells could cost from $200,000 to $1 million, the 
city documents estimate. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city Bureau of Sanitation is also asking the air district 
to stop enforcing its 500 p.p.m. rule at the landfill, saying that it is unable 
to comply. The air district will consider the city's application April 17, said 
Dave Rutherford, a spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The city is seeking to increase the garbage it dumps at its 392-acre Lopez 
Canyon landfill from 400 to 650 truckloads per day. 
</P>
<P>
Kagel Canyon and Lake View Terrace resident groups, backed by Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, the area's representative, are fighting the expansion project.

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD CUTS $113 MILLION -- AS A START 
</P>

<P>
Struggling to keep budget cuts as far away from the classroom as possible, Los 
Angeles school board members voted Monday to slash more than $113 million -- 
mostly by cutting administrative costs and borrowing from building funds -- 
from next year's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, facing a deficit that may exceed $200 million next year, the board must 
come back in the next few months to lop about $85 million more from its 
$3.9-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this day of reckoning would come. And here it is," said board member 
Roberta Weintraub. "I don't like any of these cuts. They are very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the cuts -- $75.4 million -- represent one-time savings, 
meaning the district will have to find ways to make up for those funds in the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
The next-heaviest cuts came from the district's central and region 
administrative offices, where almost $33 million will be slashed, mostly 
through personnel reductions. Los Angeles Unified School District officials 
will report back in a month with a breakdown of positions recommended for 
elimination. 
</P>
<P>
"What good is a raise (24% over three years) for the teachers of the district 
when all these support positions are going to be removed?" complained board 
member Rita Walters, who was the only one to vote against all cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted to hold off on more than $11 million in recommended cuts that 
would have eliminated 98 teaching positions, increased the size of some classes 
that include special-education students and eliminated individual-school 
allotments of funds the district receives from the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The district receives about $100 million from lottery proceeds and spends about 
80% of that for employee salaries and benefits. The amount of lottery money 
going to individual schools has been reduced each year, from $20 per student in 
1986 to $5.05 now. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had expected to have to make heavy budget cuts this year, in 
part because of employee pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
That need was compounded when Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state budget, 
unveiled last January, cut the expected cost-of-living increase to schools, 
resulting in about $50 million less than the district had expected. The Los 
Angeles school district receives nearly three-quarters of its revenue from the 
state. When the state adopts its own final budget this summer, the district may 
be forced to make even more cuts.

COUNTY AIDS PROGRAM BLAMED FOR RISING CASES IN POOR AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of people developing AIDS in Los Angeles County has risen twice as 
fast in poor and minority communities as in more affluent areas -- an 
observation that Los Angeles city AIDS officials attribute to unequal access to 
AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson, the city's AIDS coordinator, studied the annual rates of increase 
in AIDS cases between 1986 and 1989 and found that the numbers rose at least 
twice as fast in communities such as Inglewood and Compton as in areas such as 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The badly affected districts have two attributes in common, Johnson said. They 
have high rates of poverty and poor access to health care services aimed at 
delaying the onset of AIDS in people infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). 
</P>
<P>
"I refer to this report as the smoking gun," said Johnson, who submitted his 
findings Monday to the county's Commission on AIDS. "We really have documented 
that the lack of early treatment services coming from the county is resulting 
in people getting sick faster." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wants county health officials to initiate an emergency public awareness 
campaign on the importance of early treatment and to make available low-cost 
AIDS drugs in all county health facilities, not just in the large medical 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
He wants all people who test positive for the AIDS virus at county test sites 
to be referred immediately for treatment. He also wants outpatient AIDS and HIV 
services at the county medical centers greatly expanded to lessen the wait for 
an appointment.

WATER BOARD OFFICIAL ACQUITTED OF ARSON IN HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster Superior Court judge found Antelope Valley water board member Glenn 
Martin not guilty Monday of a charge that he intentionally set fire to his 
Lancaster house last year. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Margaret Grignon announced the acquittal on a single count of felony 
arson after presiding over a three-day, non-jury trial last week. 
</P>
<P>
Although Grignon said she had suspicions about the origin of the fire, she said 
testimony by an insurance company investigator that the fire was accidental 
raised a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, Martin left Lancaster for a vacation and was unavailable for 
comment, a water agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 67, has served 16 years on the board of directors of the Antelope 
Valley-East Kern Water Agency. If convicted, he could have been sentenced to up 
to eight years in prison and would have been forced to resign from the board, 
because convicted felons cannot hold public office. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Hunter, one of Martin's six colleagues on the board, said in a telephone 
interview Monday that he wrote to the judge on Martin's behalf and was glad to 
hear of the acquittal. Hunter said he argued that Martin would not have 
committed a crime that could have prevented him from holding elected office 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"His whole life revolves around being on the water agency board," Hunter said. 
"It seemed incredible that he would do anything to jeopardize that." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon, who prosecuted the case, said Grignon's 
decision appeared to have been based on defense testimony by an insurance 
investigator about the fire, which began in a living room and caused heavy 
damage to the junk-strewn home last July. 
</P>
<P>
The investigator said the blaze could have been caused by careless smoking, 
countering testimony by arson investigators who said evidence showed that it 
was set intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he was able to call an expert was really critical," Damon said. 
"It's scientific evidence, and reasonable minds differ over scientific 
interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who has twice been convicted under Lancaster's nuisance ordinance for 
storing junk on his property, acted as his own attorney during last week's 
trial. His defense featured exhibits of memorabilia from his days as a fighter 
pilot in World War II and recollections of his youth, as an argument that he 
was not the kind of man who would voluntarily destroy items he valued. He 
alleged that the charges against him were politically motivated. Prosecutors 
described that as nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Martin stands to collect an insurance payment of about $120,000, according to 
court testimony.

POLITICS: WITH BANS ON NEIGHBORHOOD ADVERTISING, HIDDEN HILLS COUNCIL 
CANDIDATES USE PUBLIC MEETINGS TO DEBATE ELECTION ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawn signs and campaign flyers are largely banned by the restrictive covenants 
agreed to by Hidden Hills homeowners, so the politicking in the city's April 10 
election is not outwardly visible. 
</P>
<P>
But inside the city's administration building, the candidates have regularly 
traded barbs at City Council meetings over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
While many other cities rigidly control the amount of time citizens may speak, 
Hidden Hills frequently allows its residents to interrupt council members and 
speak as long or as often as they wish. 
</P>
<P>
In the "town hall-style" meetings, politics has been brought directly to the 
five-member council's doorstep in dialogues that have focused on the main issue 
facing the city: a proposed 48-unit lower-cost apartment building for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Among the combatants have been Mayor Chris K. Van Peski, Councilwoman Colleen 
M. Hartman and Councilman Warren H. McCament, who are seeking reelection in the 
at-large contest. They have tried to parry the verbal jabs of the opposition 
candidates, residents Howard Klein, Susan Norris Porcaro and David G. Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
* Van Peski, 54, vice president of a Woodland Hills electrical engineering 
firm, was appointed to a council vacancy in 1986, when no other candidates 
sought the seat in the election. He has supported the lower-cost housing plan 
as a way to settle a lawsuit against the city and comply with state housing law 
while minimizing the effect on the city. 
</P>
<P>
* McCament, 69, a San Fernando-based criminal-defense and family law attorney, 
also was appointed in 1986 under the same circumstances as Van Peski. He said 
he is counting on a "silent majority" to vindicate the incumbents. McCament 
said the housing proposal is important because it is closely linked to the 
city's use of redevelopment to build a drainage project that could save the 
city from massive civil liability in the event of a flood. 
</P>
<P>
* Hartman, a nurse, served 16 years on the council until she declined to run in 
1986. But a year later, she was appointed to fulfill the term of a councilwoman 
who moved out of town. Hartman said she does not think the lower-cost senior 
housing outside the community's gates would significantly affect the city's 
rural, equestrian character. She said she also believes the need for the 
drainage project cannot be overemphasized. 
</P>
<P>
* Klein, 47, owns a Vernon-based firm that makes sportswear for women and 
children. He has consistently opposed the council's steps favoring the 
lower-cost housing but said his candidacy has "nothing to do with affordable 
housing." He said he would not defy a Los Angeles Superior Court judge who 
recently said a court settlement requires the city to approve the housing. But 
Klein said the settlement itself is "illegal" and "can be fought in court." 
</P>
<P>
* Stanley, 38, is an attorney and an executive vice president of Lorimar 
Television in Culver City. He said he is against including any multifamily 
housing or additional commercial development in the city. Like Klein, Stanley 
said that the council's support for the lower-cost housing caught him by 
surprise and that the city has not adequately researched alternative policies. 
He often has couched his persistent criticism of the council by saying he has 
not been well enough informed to understand the issues fully. 
</P>
<P>
* Porcaro, 35, is a homemaker and former broadcast journalist. Porcaro said she 
also does not want multifamily housing or additional commercial development in 
Hidden Hills. She said the city is on "a misguided course" and should not use a 
redevelopment agency to fund the drainage project.

HOSPITAL CARE CUT AS 1,900 KAISER WORKERS GO ON STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Voegtli normally designs hospital offices. But on Monday he was tramping 
the halls of Kaiser Permanente's Woodland Hills hospital in a white coat with a 
stethoscope in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"They made me a doctor," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, things weren't that bad on the first day of a strike by the Hospital 
and Service Employees Union at seven of Kaiser Permanente's Southern California 
hospitals. Voegtli was working as a respiratory therapist, a job he had 
performed for many years before being transferred three years ago to Kaiser 
headquarters in Pasadena, where he now works as a senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
But with 1,000 of 1,800 workers out on strike in Woodland Hills, and another 
900 of 2,500 out in Panorama City, those remaining on the job were being 
pressed into a variety of unaccustomed assignments to fill in for the striking 
technicians and licensed vocational nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Strauss, a top administrator, handed packets of information to 200 workers 
from Kaiser facilities as far away as Bakersfield who volunteered to help 
during the strike. The packets contained a map to keep the newcomers from 
getting lost. 
</P>
<P>
She said the hospital was functioning well, although 17 non-critical-care 
patients were transferred to Humana West Hills Hospital, and the hospital was 
refusing to accept patients from ambulances unless the victims were in danger 
of dying. Thirty more patients were transferred from Panorama City's facility. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Brassfield, a spokeswoman for the hospital in Woodland Hills, said Kaiser 
Permanente member-patients were being asked to reschedule medical appointments 
to reduce the load on the volunteer workers. Several floors were closed as the 
hospital's capacity was reduced from 212 beds to 88 beds. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser officials began preparing for the strike three weeks ago, said 
Brassfield. Each employee received a card that requested background information 
on any medical skills they possessed. When the strike was called, people were 
matched with jobs that needed filling. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, ambulances were kept busy moving patients out of the hospital before 
the strike deadline at 12:01 a.m., Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The strike by hospital workers in Woodland Hills got off to an almost polite 
start. A score of pickets marched along De Soto Avenue in front of the 
hospital, passing out information apologizing for the inconvenience.

JUDGE DENIES REQUEST BY RAIL ADVOCATES TO CANCEL JUNE TRANSPORTATION MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Monday denied a request by San Fernando 
Valley rail advocates to cancel a transportation measure on the June 5 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Zebrowski denied the request by the Campaign for Valley Rail 
Transit, which charged that the measure violated the state Election Code. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign complained that the advisory measure intended to gauge voters' 
opinions on proposed rail options "asks voters to make one choice among three 
rail route alternatives or to select a fourth 'no project' alternative." The 
complaint contended that the Elections Code does not allow the use of multiple 
choice questions on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the Election Code did not specifically prohibit the use of 
multiple choice questions. 
</P>
<P>
Roger L. Stanard, a Warner Center attorney who is chairman of the Campaign for 
Valley Rail Transit, said his group went to court after learning that it would 
not be allowed to write a ballot argument supporting the option they support -- 
a 5.6-mile extension of Metro Rail across the San Fernando Valley to the San 
Diego Freeway. Until the extension was approved last week by county 
transportation officials, plans called for the subway from downtown to end at 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Stanard said the only arguments that will be on the ballot will be one written 
by county Supervisor Mike Antonovich favoring construction of a monorail from 
Universal City to Warner Center, and an argument against all rail projects by 
Encino homeowner activist Gerald A. Silver. 
</P>
<P>
Stanard said his group could not present its case on the ballot because 
Antonovich and Silver had already taken the two available places. 
</P>
<P>
The third option on the ballot is a ground-level rail line from North Hollywood 
to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum was placed on the ballot by Antonovich in the hope of boosting 
his monorail proposal, which was passed over by the County Transportation 
Commission in favor of the Metro Rail extension.

LANCASTER, PALMDALE TO HELP PAY FOR BUS COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials are preparing to end an unusual 7-year-old free 
ride that has allowed Lancaster and Palmdale to avoid paying for any of their 
community bus service, a move that could cost the two cities as much as $1.5 
million annually starting this year. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said Monday their move to require the two cities to begin 
helping fund their bus system -- as most other cities already do -- is part of 
a broader county plan to expand and improve routes and service in the booming 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley bus riders are expected to be hit too, with an increase that 
would raise the standard fare from 50 cents to 75 cents, and the fare for 
senior citizens, students and the handicapped from 20 cents to 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Fares pay for only about 12% of the service, and the county, which has been 
paying the remainder, wants the cities to begin paying their share. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are not expected to like the new plan, because it would force 
them to shift money they now use for other purposes. The matter will be a 
subject of negotiation in coming months, county officials said, but they added 
that the county has the ultimate power to dictate its terms. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Traffic Engineer Doug Dykhouse said the City Council had yet to hear 
the proposal, and added, 'It will be interesting to see what happens when they 
do hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
Dykhouse said he expects that council members would favor spending the money on 
other mass transit needs, such as park-and-ride services for the many residents 
who commute to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The county, which is responsible for unincorporated areas, is proposing to 
proportionately split the costs not covered by fares with the two cities. 
Lancaster could pay about $858,000 a year, with about $726,000 from the county 
and about $616,000 from Palmdale, projections show. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the change is necessary because of the county's plan to 
double the number of buses in the Antelope Valley from 14 to 28 to meet growing 
service demands in the area. That is expected to boost the cost of the bus 
program from $1.5 million for the coming year to about $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The service has doubled in the past two years and the costs have increased. 
There's more need than there is money in the county's coffers," said Richard 
DeRock of the county Transportation Commission. "It's time for the cities and 
the county to get together to fund the service." 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley bus service is unusual because the region is not served by the 
RTD. For years, the county has contracted for buses with a private company and 
paid most of the cost. But since at least 1983, the cities have not shared in 
the costs.

IT ALMOST HAPPENED AT 3 A.M.; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT AGREES HARRIS CASE NEEDS A FURTHER LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late last week, Robert Alton Harris was moved to a special cell in San Quentin 
state prison and three guards took up a "death watch" over him. Theirs was not 
a vigil of compassion, nor even of simple solidarity with a man deep in the 
shadow of his own mortality. Rather, their purpose was to see that Harris did 
not by his own hand take the life the state had decreed must end, thereby 
cheating the people of their justice. In its name, Harris was to have died 
early this morning, when the hand of an unseen executioner released a packet of 
cyanide granules to fall into a vat of acid, forming a lethal cloud of gas. A 
few minutes after 3 a.m., in the darkest watch of the night, the penalty 
imposed long years ago for Harris' callous murder of two teen-age boys finally 
would have been carried out. But Monday's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to 
uphold a stay granted on Friday by the Court of Appeals stopped the clock -- at 
least for now -- at 1 minute to 3. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, California has kept a kind of death watch of its own. 
Those who favor capital punishment -- as 78% of Californians do -- and those 
who oppose it -- as The Times does -- have waged a wrenching, often bitter 
struggle over this divisive issue. Its consequences have marked our state's 
politics at every level and continue to do so to this very day. 
</P>
<P>
But had this morning's scheduled execution gone forward, what would have been 
accomplished beyond Robert Harris' death? The two young men he murdered will 
not be returned to life, nor will the hearts of their families and friends be 
made whole. Nothing can accomplish those things, and that is what is most 
terrible about the crime Harris committed. 
</P>
<P>
Would others have been deterred from murder by this killer's execution? 
According to a global survey of capital punishment conducted in 1988 by the 
United Nations, "the evidence as a whole gives no positive support to the 
deterrence hypothesis." That is one reason, among many, why no other Western 
democracy maintains an active death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Could we have said with confidence that this ultimate penalty had been fairly 
imposed in this case and will be fairly dispensed in others to come? Since the 
turn of the century, 349 innocent Americans have been sentenced to die. Two of 
them have been executed during the past two years. Both were black. In fact, a 
recent report by the U.S. General Accounting Office found what it called "a 
pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities in the charging, sentencing 
and imposition of the death penalty." And, as Monday's ruling shows, even in 
the case of white defendants like Harris, the wheels of justice can grind out a 
coarse mixture of care and indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, all that can be said is that life dealt cruelly with Robert Alton 
Harris, that he dealt cruelly with others and that the state may yet deal 
cruelly with him. Reasonable people will differ on whether there is any justice 
in that, but none can say there is either goodness or mercy.

'HAIR GRAPHICS' MAKE A TONSORIAL POINT WITH STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: YOUNG PEOPLE USE JAZZY HAIRCUTS FROM INGLEWOOD BARBERSHOP AS A FORM OF 
EXPRESSION. BUT NOT AT THE NEARBY HIGH SCHOOL.

There's magic going on at The Cosmic Cut. 
</P>
<P>
The hip downtown Inglewood hair salon is a place where teen-agers slink in, 
baseball hats covering overgrown heads; an hour later, chests sticking out, 
they leave sans hats with cuts so hot they sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon in the shop, which draws customers from as far away as Orange 
County, shows you the cutting edge in black hairstyles. 
</P>
<P>
Its founder, Emmanuel Jones, sets the 13-year-old shop's far-out tone with his 
own bizarre style: EMMANUEL is etched ear-to-ear in huge block letters. 
</P>
<P>
This is a place where some cutters keep a notebook and pencil -- to sketch 
their creations -- next to the sterilized scissors. Here, haircutting has 
reached an art form known in industry parlance as "hair graphics." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper art uses the skull for a canvas. Picture a basketball player in mid-air 
jamming a ball in the hoop, a smiling Mickey Mouse, the Nike symbol, the Joker 
-- all shaved into the backs of heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do anything I can draw," said Tai Miller, one of the shop's popular 
clippers. "Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Bambi, the Smurfs, any of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
None of them, however, would be allowed inside the doors of Inglewood High 
School, which is around the corner from the shop. 
</P>
<P>
In a clash of cultural vision, Principal Lawrence Freeman has banned the cuts, 
saying blacks do not need any more hurdles on the way to success. He even 
forced the current student body president to let his designs grow out before 
letting him run for the leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
But inside the Cosmic Cut, that view gets short shrift. Jones considers the 
cuts so popular that they will cross over to whites. Someday you'll be able to 
get one at SuperCuts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Between haircuts, Jones, his wire-rimmed spectacles slung low on the nose, 
philosophizes out loud, talks up the black merchandise advertised on the walls, 
tells wild stories to the youngsters lined up for their chance in the chair and 
supervises occasional songfests from the shop's second-floor balcony. 
</P>
<P>
He has turned his shop into a hangout, a classroom, a marketplace, an amateur 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than just a barbershop," said Cindy Cameron, one of Jones' staff. 
"It's an entertainment complex. You get more than a haircut. You get a show." 
</P>
<P>
Cosmic Cut outgrew its humble roots in a closet-like shop on Market Street 
about six months ago, moving down the block to a two-story salon where a dozen 
heads can be trimmed at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The closely cropped haircuts embellished with designs first became popular 
among young blacks on the East Coast and then spread to California in the 
mid-1980s, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' 28-year-old son, Kevin, who also works at the shop, recalls cutting 
small lines in the mid-'80s and then occasional peace symbols and outlines of 
Africa. Now the designs fluctuate with the popular cultural icons of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Jones said he etched thousands of bat symbols onto heads during the 
recent Batman craze. In one 40-minute session he copied an intricate T-shirt 
design of a grimacing Joker onto one teen-ager's skull. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 50, said black hairstyles are a creature of the times, with Afros, short 
crops and processed curls going in and out of style. 
</P>
<P>
The graphic cut will be the cut of the '90s for the "in" crowd, Jones said. For 
those who can't decide on a particular graphic for their head, there are fade 
cuts in which the top of the head has long hair and the sides are shaved clean 
and different color styles in which patches of the head are dyed red, blond or 
some other color. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for sporting the graphic cuts are as varied as the designs 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It separates you from everyone else," said Willis Turner, 19, a college 
student who was awaiting a Chicken-Hawk design one day last week. "Girls notice 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Turner of Placentia says he drives to Inglewood every couple of weeks for a new 
hair graphic because he doesn't trust his head to Orange County barbers. 
</P>
<P>
Upkeep is a constant concern with the graphic cuts, which cost anywhere from $8 
for a simple part to $20 and more for designer pictures that require more 
intricate clipper action. The cuts get fuzzy after a week and lose their 
picture completely in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Braff, 17, an amateur dancer who attends Crenshaw High School in Los 
Angeles, said a wild cut gives him an added lift. "You feel like a new man when 
you come out of that chair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One high school track coach came into the shop one weekend because he had told 
his team members that he would get a graphic cut if the students won a big 
track meet. 
</P>
<P>
The white coach left the small shop with the school's initials shaved into the 
back of his otherwise conservative hairstyle. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, who bans earrings on males and anything that can be construed as gang 
attire from Inglewood High, sums up the view of those who find the cuts 
laughable. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids have every constitutional right to make themselves look like a fool," he 
said. "But we are presenting our children as marketable items who have to be 
accepted for jobs and schools. When I send a student from Inglewood High 
School, I want someone I can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, of course, disagrees. He sees in the wild haircuts an effort by young 
blacks to build self-esteem in a society that sometimes tends to view blacks as 
a whole in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
"Graphic cuts stir up a lot of excitement among those who see them," Jones 
said. "When the energy is focused on the person with the graphics, they feel it 
and it raises their self-esteem." 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 78TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
GOP PUTS ALL OF ITS EGGS IN MARSTON'S BASKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the special 78th Assembly District primary entered its final week Monday, 
Republican Jeff Marston was all but assured a spot in any June runoff when his 
last remaining active GOP opponent withdrew -- the second to do so in four 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Saying she hoped that her withdrawal will prevent Democratic front-runner Mike 
Gotch from winning election outright in the April 10 primary, insurance broker 
Jane Ramshaw said that her decision to drop out and back Marston stemmed from 
the county Republican Assembly delegation's endorsement of Marston last week. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the third Republican candidate in the campaign, lawyer Helen Rowe, 
offered the same explanation when she, too, withdrew from the race and endorsed 
Marston. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in this race to serve the district, and if the best way to do that is by 
trying to make sure that it's represented by Jeff Marston rather than Mike 
Gotch, then that's what I want to do," Ramshaw said. "I still think the right 
person for the job is me, but, looking at it realistically, I just don't have 
the numbers Jeff does." 
</P>
<P>
Marston described Ramshaw's decision as a "tremendous boost" that will allow 
Republicans who had remained neutral so long as the primary was contested "to 
come out full speed" for his campaign in the race's closing days. Concurring, 
Ramshaw added that a "unified team is bound to be stronger" than if the party's 
support were divided among three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, argued that Rowe's and Ramshaw's withdrawals actually could 
undermine the Republican Party's overriding goal of ensuring that Gotch does 
not receive the 50%-plus primary victory needed to avoid a June 5 runoff. That 
line of reasoning holds that three active Republican candidates probably would 
draw more total votes than Marston alone, a theory based on the belief that at 
least some of Rowe's and Ramshaw's supporters now will simply not bother to 
vote, despite the women's endorsement of Marston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to lose votes, not gain them," said former San Diego 
City Councilman Gotch. "I don't understand that tactic at all." 
</P>
<P>
But Marston dismissed that analysis as "a classic case of looking at the cup as 
half empty rather than half full." 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a lot more than it takes away," said Marston, a one-time aide to 
former San Diego City Councilwoman Gloria McColl and former Sen. S. I. Hayakawa 
(R-Calif.). "Now, we're all moving in the same direction." 
</P>
<P>
Ramshaw's name, like Rowe's and that of Democratic lawyer Byron Georgiou, who 
dropped out of the race last month to run for Congress, will remain on the 
ballot -- a fact that Gotch argued will minimize the significance of the 
Republicans' late withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
Although nine names will appear on the 78th District ballot, Ramshaw's decision 
reduced the number of active candidates to six -- Marston, Peace and Freedom 
Party candidate Jane Rocio Evans and Democrats Gotch, attorney Howard Wayne, 
attorney Judith Abeles and county probation officer A. L. (Bud) Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unorthodox procedures governing special elections, all candidates of 
all parties will appear on a single ballot in next month's primary. If no 
candidate receives more than 50% of the vote -- a margin that only former Gotch 
is thought to have even a slim chance of surpassing -- the top vote-getters of 
each party will compete in June for the Assembly seat vacated by Democrat Lucy 
Killea's election to the state Senate last December. 
</P>
<P>
As he has from the outset, Gotch said Monday that he continues to view the 50% 
threshold as an unobtainable goal in the primary -- for mathematical, if not 
political, reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They all could drop out, and it wouldn't change our game plan," Gotch said. 
"We've been looking at June all along."

ASIAN CAUSES ON SHORT END OF CHARITY GIFTS, STUDY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While charitable interests such as United Way have begun more active courting 
of Los Angeles' ethnic communities, a new report has found that less than half 
of 1% of all donations from foundations and corporations in the region went to 
Asian causes. 
</P>
<P>
Given that Asian-Americans make up about 10% of the population in Los Angeles 
County and have become the county's fastest growing ethnic group, Asian 
community leaders met Friday to talk about becoming better charity recipients. 
</P>
<P>
An initial reaction to the study might be that Japanese-Americans don't need 
help, said Bill Watanabe, president of the Asian Pacific Planning Council, 
which issued the report. He said that the council represents about 50 agencies 
that serve the 10 major Asian Pacific communities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that some Asian organizations are hampered by "the general 
fallacy" of Asians being a "model minority" with fewer problems than other 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, Watanabe said, is that Asian organizations historically have 
had limited success in applying for grants. Many Asian groups, because they 
have few or no ties to foundations, he said, assume that they will not get 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not criticizing or pointing fingers at the major funders," Watanabe 
said at the meeting in Marina del Rey. "This study was done more in the spirit 
of asking ourselves, 'Are we doing things right?' and 'Where do we go from 
here?' We hope the donors are doing the same." 
</P>
<P>
The study, which examined the four-year period from 1984 through 1987, profiled 
corporations and foundations across the nation, as well as in Los Angeles. It 
included a look at the philanthropic powerhouse, United Way. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 360 charities funded by United Way in the Los Angeles-area, only eight 
were Asian American groups. And, even though United Way funding increased from 
about $200,000 in 1984 to $350,000 in 1988, the latest figure still represented 
only 0.6% of its total donations. This year, United Way raised nearly $95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The percentages for all corporate and foundation donations to Asian agencies 
nationwide were similarly low, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not, in any way, going to fool ourselves into thinking that the United 
Way network reaches all ethnic groups," said Leo Cornelius, president of the 
United Way of Greater Los Angeles. "All I can say is we are taking a look at 
what funding ought to be." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, "In some fashion, ethnic communities benefit from United 
Way's agencies which address the issues that transcend any one community," such 
as the lack of AIDS treatment centers and child care. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius, who was credited by Watanabe for initiating a "perestroika-type 
effort" within the United Way, said that a 2-yearreassessment of the 
organization's priorities will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian-funding study concluded that agencies need to persist in applying for 
grants, thus giving donors the opportunity to learn more about the needs in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"People giving out the grants would like to know who they are giving their 
money to," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, 
one of the state's largest philanthropic donors. "They are human beings, after 
all."

CONSERVING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Barbara and Ventura are now on mandatory water rationing. How long will 
it take for other Southland municipalities to implement such plans to save 
water? 
</P>
<P>
According to recent articles in The Times, (water) use is divided up 
accordingly: one-third for private residences, one-third for business and 
construction, and one-third for remaining needs. Waste runs rampant in Costa 
Mesa and especially in Newport Beach, where streams, small lakes and automatic 
sprinklers in complexes can be seen running into storm drains. Newport Beach 
recently reported daily usage of 18.5 million gallons for 100,000-plus 
residents. How absurd!

These families are living in cars, the streets, or have been evicted and ask

I volunteer for Meals on Wheels. These old people are living in trailers, are

Let's stop funding the guns which are killing innocent people and spend it on 
our own poor and homeless. SOS deserves our support. The NIMBY (Not In My Back

SALE NEWS IS NO JOLT TO PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There were no shouts of joy. No feelings of remorse. The Padres acted quite 
nonchalant, if you want to know the truth, upon learning on Monday that the 
club will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, maybe the new guy can at least give this bunch some acting 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Padre owner Joan Kroc announced at a press conference Monday that TV producer 
Tom Werner of Los Angeles and nine general partners have signed a letter of 
intent to purchase the club. The price: $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through this before, haven't we?" said Jack McKeon, Padre manager 
and vice president/baseball operations. "What does Yogi say, 'It's not over 
'til it's over.' 
</P>
<P>
"But this should be different. It's not like the last time where the guy 
already owned a baseball team." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon was referring to the last time the Padres appeared to be sold, in 1987 
to Seattle Mariners owner George Argyros. The deal collapsed in the final 
stages, however, and Kroc decided to hang on to the team. 
</P>
<P>
There's optimism on each side that this sale will be completed, but it was 
revealed Monday that the eight-man ownership committee still has yet to examine 
the prospective ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't received an ownership application from the group," said Jerry 
Reinsdorf, Chicago White Sox owner, "so they have a long ways to go. There's 
still a whole series of documents that must be submitted." 
</P>
<P>
Once the documents are received by the eight-man committee, Reinsdorf said, the 
financial, business and personal backgrounds of each of the 10 owners will be 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look to see if they have the financial entity to cover losses," 
Reinsdorf said. "We'll look at their capital reserve. And we'll look at their 
partnership agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"They still have to have a purchase agreement, so it could take as long as 90 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The major league owners would then vote on approval of the sale, with 
three-quarters majority vote needed by the other 11 National League owners, and 
a simple majority vote required by the 14 American League owners. 
</P>
<P>
The owners likely would vote on the sale at their next quarterly meetings, June 
13-14 in Cleveland, but Reinsdorf said it's possible that a special meeting 
could be called beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
While lawyers and legal assistants will pass documents back and forth during 
the next three months, the Padres say they'll simply continue to run their 
operations as if everything is status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"She's (Kroc) a good owner, I hate to see her go," McKeon said, "but we're 
going to be under the gun whether it's the present ownership or a new 
ownership." 
</P>
<P>
The players showed little emotion when informed of the agreement between Kroc 
and Werner's group, but spent time reminiscing about Kroc's reign. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard so many times how the club was going to be sold," Padre outfielder 
Tony Gwynn said, "so it's kind of hard to believe now. I mean, I knew it was up 
for sale and everything, but I just didn't think it would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sure had some weird things happen with this ballclub. We've had 
suspensions. We've had drug suspensions. We had a lockout. We had a strike. We 
had Goose (Gossage) going off. 
</P>
<P>
"But I guess the thing that sticks out in my mind the most was when she came 
downstairs to see the players in 1987. We were really stinking up the joint. 
But she came down and said, 'We love you, and the community loves you.' 
</P>
<P>
"To hear her speak, that meant a lot to us, especially at that time, because we 
were getting clobbered. She even told Goose to smile. Then she looked at me, 
and she had heard the financial problems I was having, and came over and hugged 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Craig Lefferts, who will be spending his fifth season in the 
organization, said: "Both Ray (Kroc) and Joan did a lot for baseball in San 
Diego. They should be commended for their ownership. They put a good baseball 
team on the field. They were concerned about the community. They were concerned 
about the fans. There's not many owners who can put together a better package." 
</P>
<P>
There, of course, were numerous jokes in the clubhouse about Werner's Hollywood 
background. The players talked about how producers' jackets would replace Padre 
warm-up jackets, directors' chairs would replace clubhouse stools, and bit 
acting parts in "The Cosby Show" series will sure be better than sitting home 
all winter. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, there was even a debate going on which of Werner's shows were better: 
Cosby or "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be kind of different to walk in here and have somebody else 
owning the team after all these years," Padre shortstop Garry Templeton said. 
"She's a good friend of mine. When I was having some problems in St. Louis, she 
gave me an opportunity and took care of me. 
</P>
<P>
"She came down to the clubhouse only when she thought it was necessary, but she 
never once interfered. 
</P>
<P>
"She was everything you wanted an owner to be." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon was infuriated Monday upon learning that baseball owners have changed 
their minds once again and now will revert to a 27-man roster for the first 
three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need 27 guys," McKeon said. "It's just ridiculous. There's not going 
to be enough work for them. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had been allowed to carry 25, it would have been ideal. We could have 
carried the one extra pitcher, and everything would be fine. 
</P>
<P>
"All this does is help out the clubs with no idea what they're doing. They're 
getting another three weeks to decide. It's like going to the winter meetings 
now with no trading deadline." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said he would not necessarily carry the allowed limit of 27 players, but 
when asked what he'd do if the other 25 clubs had a 27-man roster, he said: "If 
everybody else goes to 27, it'd be stupid on my part not to have the same 
advantage. But I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
The extra three roster spots are expected to be filled by pitcher Rafael Valdez 
or Eric Nolte; outfielder Shawn Abner; and first baseman Rob Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see what's good about it either," Abner said. "All that does is delay 
the agony. It's like sitting in a sauna for three weeks, waiting to see what 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're keeping us around just to be insurance policies, it'd be better if 
they'd just trade us. The whole thing stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres extended their winning streak to five games Monday with a 5-3 
victory over the Angels. They overcame a 3-0, fourth-inning deficit, marking 
the fifth consecutive time they have posted come-from-behind victories. . . . 
Rookie Rafael Valdez, who said he has been bothered by a stiff biceps muscle 
lately, pitched two scoreless innings for the victory. He has allowed just 
three hits in his past five innings, yielding one run. "I hope it's good 
enough," Valdez said, "because this is where I want to be." . . . After 
committing 13 errors in their first five games, the Padres have not committed 
an error in three of the past four games. . . . Padre outfielder Darrin Jackson 
went two for three Monday, driving in two runs.

PROFANITY IS FOUND TOO OFTEN IN GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL TANTON, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you attend college basketball games, you have heard the profanity and the 
obscene chants. You have heard thousands of spectators shouting vulgarities in 
unison at game officials or opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's NCAA championship game was played in Denver, home of neither 
Duke nor Nevada-Las Vegas. The spectators were an upscale, corporate gathering, 
much as a Super Bowl or World Series are. On-campus games provide the best 
opportunities for mass profanities. 
</P>
<P>
If you see all your college basketball on TV, maybe you don't even know what's 
going on. Maybe you're unaware of the trashy language that has become de 
rigueur. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe you've heard it and you don't care. Pity. You should. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges should feel shamed by the public behavior of their students -- and how 
much more public can you be than on national TV? 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 28 I was at College Park, Md., as Maryland defeated North Carolina 
State. In a scramble for a loose ball, State's Chris Corchiani gave a Maryland 
player a shove. That did it. Corchiani had been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Next thing anybody knew, it seemed as if all 13,000 spectators in Cole Field 
House were directing an obscene chant at Corchiani every time he touched the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
No Maryland coach or official raised a hand in protest. This sort of thing is 
accepted today. 
</P>
<P>
The following week, on March 6, I was at the Towson State-Lehigh game, the 
finals of the East Coast Conference tournament. The game was carried live on 
ESPN. The crowd was as vulgar as the one at College Park. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a Towson fan ran up and down the sideline behind the press table, 
screaming vulgarities at the referee. If he had shouted the same things on the 
streets of Towson, Md., he could have been arrested for disturbing the peace. I 
noticed the ECC's assistant commissioner, Marie Wozniak, watching in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, I was back at College Park, talking with Maryland's lacrosse 
Coach, Dick Edell, who is a Towson alumnus. He had seen the Towson game on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"The profanity came through on ESPN loud and clear," Edell said. "I hate it 
when kids act that way, and they do it everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
It is a common practice all over the country for spectators to behave in such a 
gross manner. Maryland and Towson State have no monopoly on this. 
</P>
<P>
I called Wozniak the other day. She remembered the jerk at Towson. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's embarrassing," she said, "but it's become part of the game. But 
how do you police it? 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a student at Temple we played at St. Bonaventure. The things the 
spectators were hollering were scary -- and this was at a women's game." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Duke was at College Park, the Maryland students got on Danny 
Ferry with a chant, a play on his surname. I asked Ferry if that had bothered 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I complain?" he asked with a laugh. "Our students at Duke are the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
So it is done all over -- at elite schools, at Catholic schools. But it is not 
done everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"When I worked in Chapel Hill at the University of North Carolina, we didn't 
have it," said Tom Calder, now assistant athletic director at Johns Hopkins. 
"If it started, Dean Smith would get on the mike and tell the crowd, 'We don't 
do that here.' And it would stop." 
</P>
<P>
Good for Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
John Suter, a vice president at Towson State, said this: 
</P>
<P>
"I think this student behavior phenomenon is a manifestation of the permissive 
society these kids have grown up in. If their parents grew up in the '60s, I 
wonder if they care. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this sort of vulgarity has any place in a university. But I 
don't even like it when the crowd at the Orioles games goes 'Oh!'in the middle 
of 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' " 
</P>
<P>
A former Catholic chaplain at Duke told me yesterday: 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a tradition at Duke for the students to act that way. The 
president of the university would have nothing to do with the problem when I 
was there. College presidents tend to regard athletics and athletic departments 
as out of their control." 
</P>
<P>
It's time they got them under their control. Until they do, their institutions 
will continue to be embarrassed.

<P>
UCSD BASEBALL COACH DIDN'T ENJOY THIS HOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego baseball Coach Lyle Yates was not very happy after an 11-11 tie at 
Cal State Hayward last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached nine years here at UCSD, and I've never seen anything like it," 
he said. "That's the most obvious homer (umpiring) I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Here was the scene: 
</P>
<P>
UCSD had just pulled ahead, 12-11, in the top of the 11th inning. In the bottom 
of the 11th, Triton ace Rick Rupkey got the first two Hayward batters out on 
two pop-ups with just three pitches. He hit the next guy on one pitch and 
walked the next on four -- all questionable calls, Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
And then it was over. The ump called the game on darkness. The game reverted 
back to the previous inning and was ruled a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Yates was stunned. "I've never seen anything like it," he repeated. "Either you 
don't start the 11th, or you let it finish. I guarantee you there was plenty of 
light compared to just five minutes prior. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just boom, see you guys later. I couldn't believe it. Of course, the 
Cal State Hayward coach wasn't saying boo." 
</P>
<P>
As hot as Yates was then, things were much better later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Yates got his 200th victory in the first game of a double header 
sweep of visiting Wisconsin Whitewater. Yates' record is 201-187-4. 
</P>
<P>
Of those four ties, two have come in the last 14 games as UCSD has posted a 
10-2-2 mark during that span after beginning the season 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Its victories Saturday represented UCSD's fifth consecutive double header sweep 
this season, a school record. UCSD is 14-8-2 overall. 
</P>
<P>
In college tennis, players are there own umpires for the most part, and no one 
ever accuses Dan Mattera of being a "homer". 
</P>
<P>
Mattera, a senior at the University of San Diego and ranked 39th in the nation, 
was presented with the Grover C. Hall Jr. Sportsmanship award Sunday at the 
Blue-Gray National Collegiate Championships at Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the trophy and a watch, $1,000 will be presented to USD's tennis 
program in Mattera's name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of nice to give something back to the university," Mattera said, 
adding the punch line, "Although, I don't think I would have given that much." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this kind of award is becoming commonplace for Mattera. In December, 
he won the Marty Pincus Memorial Sportsmanship Award at the Fiesta Bowl 
tournament in Tempe, Ariz., and as a freshman won the Evelyn Housman Award and 
a lifetime membership in the U.S. Tennis Assn. during a junior tournament. 
</P>
<P>
What's his secret? 
</P>
<P>
"I take an interest in the people running the tournament," he said. "I don't 
just play and leave. I stick around and talk to people. I talk to my opponent 
after the match. I talk to him before the match. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, I think I'm fair with my line calls, and I think people appreciate 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Blackburn, a 5-foot-8 guard who signed with San Diego State's women's 
basketball team in November, averaged 13.6 points and led Brea-Olinda High in 
steals averaging 3.5 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda was ranked fourth in the nation by USA Today and had a 55-game 
winning streak before losing in the CIF Division III state championship. 
</P>
<P>
For her efforts, Blackburn was selected to The Times' All-Orange County team. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the bad news. She showed up at the awards breakfast Sunday in Anaheim 
with her arm in a sling after undergoing shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Blackburn had surgery to repair her other shoulder and major 
back surgery to correct a curvature in her spine. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Sortino, who signed early with the University of San Diego, also was 
selected to the Orange County team. Sortino, a 5-7 guard from Marina High, 
averaged 20.4 points and was the co-most valuable player of the prestigious 5-A 
Sunset League.

HOWELL ENDS UNUSUAL DAY IN USUAL WAY; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: RELIEVER SAYS HIS THREE CONSECUTIVE STRIKEOUTS ARE AN ABERRATION THIS 
EARLY IN THE SEASON.

<P>
In this most unusual of springs, Dodger relief pitcher Jay Howell had the most 
unusual of outings Monday. Especially for a guy appearing in only his fourth 
game since last September. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the Atlanta Braves in the eighth inning with a 2-1 Dodger lead, he 
struck out Lonnie Smith. And struck out Nick Esasky. And struck out Dale 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dodgers had won, 2-1, Howell then offered a most unusual explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fluke, an aberration," Howell said. "It didn't happen. I didn't do 
it. It's way too early for something like that." 
</P>
<P>
It was mentioned that in four innings this spring, Howell has allowed no runs 
and one hit with five strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care, I'm not anywhere near where I want to be, not even close," 
Howell said. "Must have been because it was hot, the sun was up, the conditions 
were just right. . . . I don't know what happened. But that was not me. I've 
only been pitching for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the season starts, your average pitcher is not going to be like this. 
Believe me." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who improved their spring record to 4-3, hope he is joking. A week 
before opening day, they could use some good news from their bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's projected partner, Jim Gott, was pulled from his scheduled appearance 
in a B game against Houston Monday, and is instead scheduled to pitch today in 
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., against the New York Yankees. Gott, recovering from elbow 
surgery, said the Dodgers just wanted to allow his arm an extra day of rest 
before he tries three innings. Yet he is becoming less of a certainty to begin 
opening day with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's agreement Monday to field 27-man rosters until April 30 has possibly 
given jobs -- however temporary -- to pitchers Don Aase and Jim Neidlinger, and 
outfielder John Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
While Aase and Shelby are veterans, it would be Neidlinger's first big league 
experience. The right-hander, who was 8-6 with a 4.06 ERA for triple-A 
Albuquerque last season, was voted the top pitcher in the Venezuelan League 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
In his second spring start Monday, he threw five shutout innings against a 
Houston Astros B team. In his first start last week, he allowed no earned runs 
in two shutout innings against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Aase, who the Dodgers feel can be effective in spot relief situations, picked 
up the save in Monday's A game 2-1 win against Atlanta with a scoreless inning. 
He has still allowed four runs in six spring innings, but Dodger officials are 
counting on his 12 years of big-league experience. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby, battling to forget last year's .183 average, is batting .313 this 
spring and will appreciate the extra three weeks to continue his battle with 
Jose Gonzalez for the fifth outfielder spot. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson is apparently battling to overcome more than just a surgically 
repaired knee. On Monday he spoke of a nerve problem in his lower left leg 
caused by scar tissue from his Aug. 29 knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Despite two cortisone shots this winter, he said a lower part of the leg is 
still numb, although he says it will not affect his hitting or running. "It's 
uncomfortable, but I can play with it," he said. "Maybe this off-season they 
can get in there and fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson took another 150 swings in the batting cage Monday, but still has not 
run the bases because of tenderness in his left knee. He will accompany the 
team to Los Angeles Wednesday and continue his rehabilitation there, where he 
can be near the Dodger doctors. For the first time Monday, he mentioned the 
possibility of playing a couple of games in the minor leagues on a 
rehabilitation option before coming off the disabled list, which could be as 
soon as late April. 
</P>
<P>
"They might want to shoot me out someplace for a couple of games before I come 
back ready to go," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers Orel Hershiser and Tim Belcher, scheduled to pitch in the season's 
first and second games respectively, will not leave for Los Angeles Wednesday 
night with the team. They will stay behind and pitch in a minor league game 
Thursday, and fly out afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros won Monday's B game, 4-3, but the more important Dodger news was the 
continued health of Kal Daniels, who played five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Although he went 0 for 3 and has still not been tested on the bases, he ran 
down a fly ball in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Howell's heroics in the main game against Atlanta in West Palm Beach, 
Mike Morgan strengthened his bid for the fifth starting spot by allowing one 
run in four runnings. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel had a single to extend his spring hitting streak to six games after 
being shut down in the spring opener. 
</P>
<P>
New Dodger pitcher Terry Wells will make his debut today in Ft. Lauderdale 
against the New York Yankees. He will follow John Wetteland and Jim Gott, and 
precede Mike Hartley. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Anaheim's Billy Bean is sent to triple-A Albuquerque as expected, fans 
will get to see him in this weekend's Freeway Series with the Angels, as he 
will join four other non-roster players in accompanying the team west from Vero 
Beach Wednesday afternoon -- pitchers Don Aase, Jim Neidlinger and Mike Munoz, 
and outfielder Mike Huff.

BASEBALL ROSTERS GO BACK TO 27 PLAYERS FOR THREE WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<P>
Baseball teams and players reversed course again Monday and decided to expand 
rosters to 27 players for the first three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The sides reached a verbal agreement to expand rosters on March 19, the day 
they agreed to a new four-year labor contract. But the roster deal collapsed 
last week when they couldn't agree on how it would affect outright assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Teams will have to reduce to the normal minimum of 24 players and maximum of 25 
on May 1. A proposed change that would have lowered the five-inning requirement 
for starters to get a victory was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to take a big load off, not just the pitchers, but the whole 
team. I'm extremely happy," Dodger reliever Jim Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Boston Manager Joe Morgan: "I think we should have left it at 27 in the 
first place. It's going to help the nameless three." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weiner, an attorney for the union, said the outline for the agreement 
was made over the weekend in telephone conversations between union executive 
director Donald Fehr and Deputy Commissioner Stephen Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Fehr and I are pleased that both sides could reach an agreement on an 
issue of such significance to the players, managers and fans," Chuck O'Connor, 
the owners' chief negotiator, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fehr: "Just look at it as the aftermath of a long negotiation. Thankfully 
it was straightened out reasonably quickly." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best way to do it," Dodger infielder Mickey Hatcher said. "We were 
looking at a situation where the risk of injury would be very serious. This 
takes a lot of the pressure off. We can save a lot of wear and tear on the 
pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
Teams will designate up to three additional players to management's Player 
Relations Committee, which will inform the union of the names. The identity of 
those players will not be made known to players, agents or other teams. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, players sent outright to the minors for a second time, or players 
with more than three years of major league service sent outright for the first 
time, can elect to become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Under Monday's agreement, the union will allow teams to request advance waivers 
through Sunday and ask additional players to agree to waive their right to free 
agency if sent to the minors outright. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the first outright, it still counts as the first outright," Weiner 
said. "The theory is that extra players designated as additional players should 
be no better or worse off than they would have been at the end of spring 
training, except for the obvious fact that they're going to be better off in 
that they're going to get major league service and major league salary for this 
expansion period." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr was disappointed the proposed change about innings for starting pitchers 
was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"That's too bad," he said. "It was meant to keep pitchers from trying too hard 
early in the season to go any kind of distance." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kind of anticipated it for a week or so," Alderson said. "The clubs were 
for it. The player agents were for it. There didn't seem to be any reason the 
PRC and the players' association ought to be against it."

FOR RADER, ROSTER CHANGE IS HEAVEN-SENT; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: MANAGER NOW HAS MORE TIME TO SEE MORE PLAYERS. AND PLAYERS ON THE 
BUBBLE HAVE MORE TIME BEFORE IT BURSTS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His first reaction was to make the sign of the cross in gratitude. But having 
been burned once before, Doug Rader checked to make sure that the restoration 
of 27-man rosters is a gift that won't be snatched away again. 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously? And no more give and take?" the Angels' manager said. "That's great 
news." 
</P>
<P>
For Rader, gaining three players balanced a 5-3 loss to the Padres Monday. The 
unexpected change also renewed the hopes of fringe and minor-league players 
whose chances of sticking with the club had diminished dramatically last week, 
when the original 27-man plan was changed to 24. Monday's announcement should 
help reliever Mark Eichhorn, outfielder Max Venable -- or possibly Dan Grunhard 
-- and infielders Kent Anderson and Bobby Rose, all of whom were in a twilight 
zone between making the team and making a trip to triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice thing to get back to where we once were," Angel General Manager 
Mike Port said. "Given the shortened spring, it's a good thing for the clubs 
and the players, and we'll try to make use of it accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he will now take 12 or 13 pitchers instead of 11, but he hasn't yet 
determined how many infielders and outfielders he will keep. The players 
involved are counting -- and hoping. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the borderline, for sure," Venable said. "This could help, but it all 
depends on the manager and what he wants to do. With the shortened spring, he 
may have to go with more pitchers. I do have to say I'm more optimistic now . . 
. It makes it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard, whose .350 batting average and outstanding defensive skills give him 
an outside shot at the last roster spot, was interested to learn about the 
expanded rosters but not especially elated. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually haven't sat down and tried to figure out the numbers," he said. 
"It's not something that concerns me directly. I'm more concerned with what I 
do on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette, who now appears to have firm hold on an outfield spot, heartily 
approved the change. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's smart," he said, "but I'm going to make this team no matter how 
many there are on the roster." 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Anderson probably would have made the roster even had it been 24, but 
27 gives him an extra bit of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you're young and in the situation I am, you've got to prove yourself 
everyday," he said. "You can't relax. You've got to work and hope that at the 
end of spring training, everything works out." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-man roster will work out well, according to Lance Parrish. "But we'd 
better hurry up and start the season before they change their minds again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Making his second start, Angel starter Chuck Finley tired noticeably in the 
fifth inning Monday. However, he wasn't perturbed about giving up three runs in 
4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone longer if I'd gotten a ground ball here or there," said 
Finley, who had pitched three shutout innings last Thursday. "I want to do 
good, but I don't want to be crazy about it. Nobody ever won the World Series 
in spring training and nobody ever won the Cy Young. I've seen a few sayonaras, 
though, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had given Finley a 3-0 lead on RBI singles by Devon White in the 
first and Johnny Ray in the third, and on Chili Davis' second home run of the 
spring, in the fourth. Derrin Jackson drove in two runs in the fifth for San 
Diego on a double, and scored the tying run after a balk by reliever Mark Clear 
and a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Rader praised Finley and said the left-hander's fatigue was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a full-effort type pitcher, and he was going all out," Rader said. "He 
did a terrific job." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said the performance was in no way a setback. 
</P>
<P>
"I went three innings the other day and this time I wanted to go four," he 
said. "It's like doing 50 sit-ups and you have to do 70. Each day you need to 
push yourself a little more. Next time, I'm shooting for six innings." 
</P>
<P>
While Anderson sat out because of strained rib cartilage, Mark McLemore had a 
strong day at shortstop. McLemore, who has played far more second base than 
shortstop in recent years, was two-for-five and looked smooth in helping turn 
two double plays. "I feel awesome. I feel good, real good," said McLemore, who 
has a spring batting average of .370 (10 for 27). "The thing I have to 
concentrate most on (while playing short) is actually throwing. From second, I 
can pretty much flip the ball. It isn't a problem, just a matter of 
concentrating." 
</P>
<P>
An incident involving Brian Downing and a fan outside Angels Stadium after the 
game was defused when coaches Moose Stubing and Bobby Knoop separated the two. 
The fan apparently had insulted Downing, who cautioned the man not to say 
anything further. No blows were struck. 
</P>
<P>
Downing was a late scratch from the lineup because of a strained muscle below 
the rib cage on his right side. That is a recurrence of the problem that has 
plagued him the past two seasons, but this time, it's only expected to idle him 
a day or two. Downing aggravated the injury while swinging the bat Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rader postponed announcing his Opening Day pitcher until today because he had 
not gotten a chance to discuss his plans with all the pitchers. It is likely to 
be Bert Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
Indisputable proof that the Angels hitting has improved was the double Jack 
Howell lined over the head of Joe Carter in center field in the fourth inning 
off left-handed starter Dennis Rasmussen. Howell hit only .140 off left-handers 
last season. 
</P>

<P>
A driver in the Parker, Ariz., Enduro Classic was thrown from his power boat 
and killed during Sunday's three-hour marathon on the Colorado River near this 
border community opposite California. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Dave Griffith, a deputy sheriff from Hawthorne, Nev., was thrown 
over the left forward portion of the boat when it hooked in the north turn of a 
two-mile loop. Griffith lost his crash helmet as he hit the water and was sent 
cartwheeling, witnesses said.

<P>
A caution flag was displayed as emergency teams removed his body from the 
water, but the race continued. 
</P>

HORSE RACING BOARD DROPS CHARGES AGAINST TRAINER STEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Horse Racing Board is dropping its case against Roger Stein, the 
trainer who was suspended for six months and fined $2,000 after one of his 
horses tested positive for cocaine after a race at Santa Anita in October of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Stein case is the last to be dismissed by the board, which dropped charges 
last year against five other trainers whose horses also tested positive for 
cocaine. Those trainers included Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera, two of the 
biggest names in racing. The three others were Albert Barrera -- trainer Laz 
Barrera's son -- Bryan Webb and Tony Hemmerick. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier charges were dropped after the board was advised by the state 
attorney general's office that the cases were weak. The Stein case apparently 
is being dropped for the same reason. Members of the board were reluctant to 
discuss the Stein matter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera recently filed a $25-million suit against Truesdail Laboratories, the 
Tustin facility that handles the state's horse testing. Truesdail's contract 
expires on June 30 and the racing board is soliciting 105 labs to make bids on 
the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, 36, has also filed a $25-million suit but it wasn't clear Monday whether 
that would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to see the order before I can comment," said Russ Iungerich, 
Stein's attorney. "If the board has dropped the case, then justice has been 
done, but whether we will go ahead with damages hasn't been determined." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing before an administrative law judge, Amanda Behe, had been scheduled 
for April 17 in Los Angeles. Stein, who said he was planning on introducing new 
evidence, had opposed the use of Behe, who had presided over an earlier hearing 
in the case and ruled against the trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the lab breached its contract a long time ago, when 
it started coming up with all these positive tests that weren't positives," 
Stein said. "If the lab loses its contract, it's because they've fired 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Stein, who had gone back to training harness horses at Los Alamitos, said that 
he would try to reassemble a thoroughbred stable. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 18 months have changed my life," Stein said. "I'll never get over the 
bitterness. Even though this has finally been dropped, once there are the 
accusations, there's always going to be a lot of doubt in people's minds."

GARAGIOLA EMPATHIZES WITH WAY MUSBURGER WAS TREATED BY CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Garagiola was answering calls from baseball fans on a radio talk show in 
Kansas City, Mo., Sunday, when he got what he thought was a crank call. 
</P>
<P>
The caller wanted to know why CBS had fired announcer Brent Musburger. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Hey, that's got to be an April Fool's joke,' " Garagiola said. "But 
then I saw Connie Chung talking about it on television, and I couldn't believe 
it. They shocked me with the timing of it." 
</P>
<P>
CBS made the announcement on April Fool's Day, the day before Musburger did 
play-by-play of the NCAA championship basketball game in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
And no one was more surprised by the news than Garagiola, who left NBC after 
the 1988 baseball season, ending 27 years as an announcer on the network's 
"Game of the Week." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure CBS had (its) reasons," Garagiola said. "One (caller) asked me if CBS 
fired him just to jack up ratings. I said, 'For the Final Four? You've got to 
be crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
After Garagiola left NBC, the network lost a bidding war with CBS for the 
baseball contract. CBS will begin televising baseball this spring, and 
Musburger was to have been part of the announcing crew. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed the 'Game of the Week,' " Garagiola said Monday from his home 
in Scottsdale, Ariz. "My reason for leaving was my decision. I wasn't told to 
leave and I didn't know NBC was going to lose (the baseball TV contract) to 
CBS, although everyone thought I knew. 
</P>
<P>
"Afterward, I felt bad for the guys in the trenches, the cameramen and the 
crew. But as far as the executives, I couldn't have cared less." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger's 5 1/2-year contract, which pays $2 million annually, runs through 
July -- but CBS decided to relieve him of his duties after Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The contracts today are written on ice," Garagiola said. "(Sports director) 
Tom Gallery brought me to NBC. When you dealt with him, it was written in 
concrete, sealed with a handshake. Now it's all written on ice. When the sun 
comes out, it's melted." 
</P>
<P>
Garagiola said he understands Musburger's situation. He said he was frustrated 
after he left NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened there with Brent," Garagiola said. "But I do know 
that he has good ability. What he has to do now is decide what he wants. My 
advice to him is if he's looking for a job, let (producers) know he's 
available. When I left NBC, everyone thought I had retired, or was doing 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
Garagiola, who hasn't broadcast a game since the 1988 World Series, will return 
to the booth this spring as a play-by-play announcer on SportsChannel's Angel 
telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Torre, former player, manager and Angel announcer with KTLA, encouraged 
Garagiola to return to announcing. Torre will do play-by-play for KTLA's 
telecasts of 55 Angel games and will be the color commentator for 
SportsChannel's 35 telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Zrake, producer for Sports-Channel's Angel and Dodger broadcasts, said the 
network signed Garagiola to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ideal for me," Garagiola said. "I don't want to do 162 games. I was 
looking for a limited schedule. And the Angels are a ballclub that will 
contend. The announcer is there, but if you have good club, that's what people 
tune in for." 
</P>
<P>
Garagiola said he has no plans of rejoining a network full time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through it and know what it is," he said.

PAI'S TEAMMATES COME BACK TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its first game since the sudden death of teammate Ben Pai Thursday night, 
Oceanside overwhelmed visiting El Camino, 9-2, in a make up Avocado League 
baseball game Monday at Oceanside. The scheduled game against El Camino was 
rained out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside players wore patches on their uniforms in honor of Pai, 17, who died 
of acute bronchial asthma after having an asthma attack after playing a 
recreational basketball game at the Oceanside Boys &amp; Girls Club Thursday. 
He was having difficulty breathing as he was rushed to the Tri-City Medical 
Center, where he arrived at 9:40 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 10:19 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Pirates first game in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to be back playing ball," Coach Dave Barrett said. "They were 
pressing a little too much at first, but then they settled down." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates' eight-run fourth inning opened up the game, with Oceanside's Terry 
Vaughn getting two hits and El Camino committing four of its five errors. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Acevedo (2-1-1) went the distance and struck out 11 for Oceanside 
(7-2-1, 1-0). Teammate Saul Gutierrez was two for three. Ricky Spears hit a 
solo home run in the fifth for El Camino (7-4, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Pai, a senior, was a starting pitcher with a 2-0 record and a 0.27 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a part of us, and he still is part of us, just in a different way," 
said Barrett. "We don't want to put pressure on ourselves, we just want to put 
forth our best effort. The kids are really plugged into that." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said team members decided to play Monday after meeting with Pai's 
parents, Benjamin Sr. and Edith Gail Pai, over the weekend. Both parents 
attended Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted us to play," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
In other Avocado League games: 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 18, Ramona 7 -- San Marcos collected eight of its 15 hits and 12 of 
its 18 runs in the second inning, the same inning Ramona made two errors and 
walked three batters. Randy Calloway hit a three-run homer and drove in four 
runs, and Eric Morton was three for four for San Marcos (6-5, 1-1). Ramona 
dropped to 2-8-1, 0-2. There were 27 hits in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido 7, Carlsbad 2 -- Neil Small picked up an RBI and two hits for 
Escondido (4-6, 1-0). Carlsbad dropped to 7-7, 0-1. Pitcher Brian Klungreseter 
improved to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar League 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 7, Vista 3 -- Junior right-hander George Hadden (2-1) threw 
a two-hitter against Vista in his second start of the season. Hadden made his 
first start in a double header against El Capitan two weeks ago and solidified 
his role as a starter after his performance against Vista (4-8-1, 1-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Poway 10, Torrey Pines 2 -- Rob Plarski and Brock Marsh were two for four and 
Matt Schwenke had two RBIs to lead Poway (6-3-1, 1-1) in Del Mar. Scott 
Tittrington (2-0) was the winner. Greg Wilbur had a two-run homer for Torrey 
Pines (5-6, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista 7, El Cajon Valley 6 -- With Monte Vista (11-3) trailing, 6-3, in 
the bottom of the seventh, Ernie Reyes, Vern Mullis and Darren Rucker all 
walked to load the bases. Reyes scored on Neal Svalstad's fielder's choice 
grounder to second as he beat the throw to the plate. Mullis scored when Curt 
Howard was hit by a pitch on the head. Rucker scored the winning run on Steve 
Dolias' sacrifice fly to right. Robbie Stone (4-1) was the winner in relief. 
John Baker went two for three for El Cajon Valley (3-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
Holtville 16, La Jolla Country Day 6 -- For Holtville, Victor Zaragoza scored 
twice and went three for three. He has six consecutive hits in his last three 
games. David Rodgers made a diving catch with two outs in the second that saved 
three runs for Holtville (6-2). LJCD fell to 3-6-1.

SYLMAR'S TRIBUTE TO VELA COMES IN FORM OF 16-2 WIN OVER RESEDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was laughter in the Sylmar High dugout again, friendly jibes exchanged 
among players and coaches. A player handed Coach Gary Donatella a batting 
helmet when Donatella was nearly leveled by a screaming foul ball. Donatella 
verbally jousted with the plate umpire and fined a couple of players for 
penny-ante rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
Winning, it seems, is therapeutic. And a lopsided victory, such as the 16-2 
defeat of host Reseda in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game Monday, is the ultimate 
panacea. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to get back on the winning track again," Donatella said. "Shoot, 
it was nice to get back out here and play again." 
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the Sylmar program was devastated by the death of senior 
outfielder Ryan Vela, who was killed in an auto crash that involved two other 
varsity players. Sylmar postponed two games with Monroe last week, school 
psychologists met with players and virtually everyone connected with the 
program was visibly affected by the news, Donatella said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very rough week," Donatella said. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service Thursday lasted 2 1/2 hours, and so many people turned out 
to pay their respects that the line stretched out the church doors, Donatella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Fernando High varsity -- Vela had transferred to Sylmar from 
San Fernando -- showed up for the service. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar players showed up for the Reseda game with Vela's uniform number, 17, 
stenciled and stitched in every place imaginable. Each player had the number on 
the back of their caps and on the left breast of their uniform top. Some had it 
painted on the backs of their spikes, others had it on their wristbands. 
</P>
<P>
The team wants to remember, yet somehow forget, what happened to their 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to remember him for the way he was, the way he liked to play," 
Donatella said. "It is a weird feeling with the numbers everywhere. But we want 
to remember him, and in a positive manner." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to move forward is to rack up a rout. London Woodfin started in 
right field, where Vela had played, and was three for four with a double, 
triple and four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird feeling, being at his old position," Woodfin said. "I knew I had 
to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the team felt similarly. Donatella said he didn't bother with a 
rah-rah speech before the game. He sensed there was no need. 
</P>
<P>
"With (Ryan) in mind, maybe that's why they played so well today," Donatella 
said. "I can't use something like this to motivate kids. All I had to do was 
listen to them and I knew they wanted this game." 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar (7-4, 3-3 in league play) blew the game open with six runs in the sixth 
to take a 13-2 lead. Nearly everyone took part in the victory: Sylmar's 14 hits 
were scattered among 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
Woodfin said the team felt there was debt to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had lost today, we'd be out here knowing in our hearts that we let 
ourselves and Ryan down," Woodfin said. "We're doing this for us, but we're 
doing it for him, too." STEVE ELLING

DIGEST: SIMI VALLEY TO NAME QUINA AS FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Quina will be named Simi Valley High's football coach in a news conference 
at the school today. 
</P>
<P>
Quina, an assistant at Moorpark High the past two seasons, will fill a spot 
vacated in November by Dave Murphy. Murphy resigned after posting a 21-40-1 
record in six seasons -- including a 1-19 mark the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Quina, 34, graduated from Royal and was an assistant coach there from 1980-84. 
He was chosen from a group of candidates that included Bob Misko, Roger McCamy 
and Joe Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Valley College's Andre Harrell has made an oral commitment to Cal Poly Pomona 
and center Cliff Barnes has committed to Cal Lutheran, Valley Coach Jim 
Stephens said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, a 6-foot-2 sophomore shooting guard who was Western State Conference 
Player of the Year, averaged 15.4 points a game and led Valley to the WSC 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes (6-6), who began his college career at Cal State Northridge, averaged 
11.2 points and seven rebounds a game and will join a Cal Lutheran team that 
loses senior center Mike Demeter. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen have also received a commitment from Kent Purser, a 5-11 guard 
from Verdugo Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
Purser averaged 21.4 points last season and was an All-Northeastern League 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
Crissy Mills of Campbell Hall High, the 1988 and 89 state champion in the 
girls' high jump, said she has made an oral commitment to attend USC on a track 
and field scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, who has a personal best of 6 feet, also considered Arizona State. "I 
just really like the school and the coaching staff," Mills said. "And I really 
got along well with the girls on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Mills was favored to win a third consecutive state high jump title, but will 
miss the season after tearing ligaments in her left knee during a volleyball 
match in September.

Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, rendered insolvent by huge losses, has little 
chance of surviving as an independent institution but a government takeover is 
not imminent, thrift industry sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said it is unlikely that Columbia will be seized by the 
federal government until after regulators decide what to do with the firm's 
huge portfolio of junk bonds, which are risky, high-yield corporate debt 
securities. That process could take several weeks or even months. 
</P>
<P>
An effort to sell the bonds, possibly to a single buyer, is being spearheaded 
by First Boston Corp., the New York investment banking firm, and Thomas 
Spiegel, who resigned as Columbia's chief executive earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
A number of investors are believed to be interested in the bond portfolio, 
including well-known private investors as well as publicly held financial 
institutions. Neither First Boston nor Thomas Spiegel would comment on their 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Columbia's shareholders probably will lose their entire 
investment. The stock closed Monday at about 40 cents a share, down 72 cents in 
New York Stock Exchange trading. Most of Columbia's stock is owned by the 
Spiegel family, led by Abraham Spiegel, 83, the company's current chairman and 
father of Thomas, 43. The elder Spiegel could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is the latest major casualty of the recent collapse in the junk bond 
market thathas also hit such other financial firms as Drexel Burnham Lambert 
and San Diego-based Imperial Corp. of America. Columbia became at one point the 
nation's most profitable thrift, largely through profits on the high-yield 
securities bought through Drexel andjunk bond king Michael Milken, who had 
close ties to the Spiegels. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, announced Sunday that its capital had been 
wiped out by about $575 million in losses in the fourth quarter of last year 
and first two months of this year. The red ink resulted primarily from 
government-mandated writeoffs and serious credit problems in its junk bond 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Columbia says it has enough viable assets that, given time, could 
lead the firm back to financial health. "Notwithstanding our current financial 
condition, we believe Columbia has the resources to reach full compliance with 
capital standards mandated by Congress before the Dec. 31, 1994, deadline," 
Columbia Chief Executive Edward G. Harshfield said in a statement Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But Harshfield was not available for comment Monday, and very few seemed to 
take his statement at face value. Harshfield is a former banker from Citicorp 
who took over as CEO last month. 
</P>
<P>
A more realistic hope, one industry official said, is that Columbia Savings 
will make enough through the sale of its junk bonds that the American taxpayer, 
at least, will be spared the expense of bailing out Columbia's losses. The 
thrift's liabilities currently exceed its assets by $121 million. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's dilemma seems certain to accelerate a heated -- if arcane -- debate 
over the methods of accounting that have caused Columbia Savings huge paper 
losses in recent months and led to the evaporation of its capital. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's legislation to bail out the S&amp;L industry contained a provision 
that forced all thrifts to sell their junk bond investments within five years. 
That, in turn, forced the thrifts to immediately recognize unrealized market 
losses on the bonds because they could no longer count on holding them until 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Even the regulatory establishment is known to be sympathetic to Columbia's 
plight, but regulators say they are merely following the will of Congress. "I 
think this is terribly unfair and I say that out of no great love for the 
Spiegels," one former high-level Washington regulator said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spiegels' dilemma does not generate much sympathy with industry 
traditionalists, who never liked Columbia's controversial -- but once legal -- 
practice of investing depositors' money in high-yield bonds. S&amp;Ls have 
traditionally invested in real estate loans, but that was only a small part of 
Columbia's investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Though not the only thrift in the nation to invest in junk bonds, Columbia 
Savings had the largest holdings. Its high-yield bond portfolio is valued at 
more $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Other thrifts that put money in junk bonds included Imperial Savings in San 
Diego and CenTrust Savings in Miami, which together owned about $1.7 billion in 
junk bonds at the end of 1989. Both financial institutions have been seized by 
regulators and are presently being operated as wards of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Any sale of Columbia's junk bonds must receive the approval of several 
regulatory bureaucracies, and it is believed that well-known buyers with 
blue-chip reputations have the best chance of getting their purchases approved.

NERVOUS SAVERS LINE UP AT OFFICES OF TROUBLED THRIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Worried depositors lined up Monday at beleaguered Columbia Savings, some intent 
on taking out their money while others were simply looking for a little 
reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
Both camps apparently got what they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Columbia's 22 savings branches were extra busy Monday and one 
particularly long line numbering about 30 people spanned the tastefully 
decorated lobby of the savings and loan's main Beverly Hills branch at 
mid-morning. But panic was noticeably absent, and some offices were downright 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Many customers said they were concerned and surprised by the announcement that 
the maverick thrift, which until recently was advertising the acumen of its 
management, had lost about $575 million in a recent five-month period, wiping 
out its capital and rendering it insolvent. Most of the losses were blamed on 
the institution's portfolio of junk bonds, those high-risk securities that have 
lost much of their value in recent months. Analysts say a government takeover 
is highly likely. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have closed accounts. That would be expected," said spokeswoman 
Lenore Hatch. She declined to specify the size of the outflow or whether 
withdrawals were heavier than deposits made on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be known for at least several days if the stunning news of 
Columbia's insolvency triggered a run on deposits. Columbia had attracted 
deposits by offering higher rates than most of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there are people who have come in and have been very concerned," 
Hatch said. "There's been a great misconception about what the insurance is." 
</P>
<P>
Deposits are insured up to $100,000 by the federal government, and some 
combinations of different types of accounts can take an individual's total 
coverage even higher. But that didn't comfort all of Columbia's depositors. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came from working out and there's no way I wasn't going to close out my 
account today," said Elaine Stein, who waited in line at the main Beverly Hills 
branch for an hour to close her three accounts, which totaled less than 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's insured and all that, but I don't care," Stein said. "I'm angry." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I blame this on Mike Milken and his crappy junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia sent extra officials into its branches to try to soothe customers, and 
many were talked into leaving their money alone. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Gold went to Columbia's Tarzana office to withdraw his $10,000 certificate 
of deposit, but was persuaded that his money is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not thinking of closing," the Encino resident said. "I think it (the 
CD) will be covered." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Bangert also decided to leave his checking account intact after a visit to 
Columbia's Costa Mesa branch. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't affect me any because everything is insured," the retired carpenter 
said. "If you can't trust the (banking) system and the government, then 
everything will go down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Doris Ostrow planned to withdraw just enough money Monday to bring her account 
under the insurance limit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will leave in the $100,000 because where do I go from here?" she 
asked. "You can't hold it in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Sy Brill is an old hand with troubled financial institutions. The Sherman Oaks 
resident said he has been a customer at Columbia's Encino office for only a few 
months -- since paying a penalty to withdraw his CD from ailing Lincoln Savings 
of Irvine, which was taken over by federal regulators.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Executive Corp., the troubled Los Angeles-based life insurance holding 
company, on Monday reported an $835.7-million net loss for its 1989 fourth 
quarter, much larger than expected and due mainly to continued declines in the 
value of its junk bond holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The writedown on its investment portfolio amounted to $859 million, which was 
$344 million more than the company in January had said it would take for the 
quarter. The company said it took the bigger writedown in part because the 
market value of the junk bond portfolio deteriorated considerably after the 
year ended. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry analysts said the huge writedown didn't appear to pose an 
immediate threat to the company's viability, and First Executive said its main 
insurance units, Executive Life of California and Executive Life of New York, 
have enough cash and liquid investments on hand to meet foreseeable needs. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive grew to prominence in the 1980s by investing heavily in 
high-yield, high-risk bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and offering 
exceptionally high returns to buyers of life insurance and annuity products. 
But like other companies that invested a big portion of their assets in junk 
bonds, First Executive's fortunes have declined as the junk bond market 
collapsed in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In its earnings statement, First Executive said the fourth-quarter loss, 
equivalent to $9.98 per share, contrasts with net income for the 1988 fourth 
quarter of $48.2 million, or 42 cents per share. First Executive reported a net 
loss for the full year of $775.6 million, or $9.67 per share, contrasted with 
net income of $174.5 million, or $1.51 per share, for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In over the counter trading, First Executive's stock ended the day unchanged at 
$2.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the company disclosed a series of actions by 
regulators, including the launching of a formal investigation last month by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is said to be looking into whether the company failed to disclose 
severe financial problems when it sold an offering of its own securities to the 
public last year. Although an informal SEC inquiry on the subject has 
previously been reported, the announcement that the commission is now taking 
formal action suggests that the SEC believes it has sufficient evidence of 
wrongdoing to go ahead with a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive, refused to comment 
on the SEC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In an SEC filing, First Executive also revealed that the California Insurance 
Commissioner recently ruled that First Executive had entered into illegal 
arrangements with a partly owned subsidiary, First Stratford Life Insurance 
Co., concerning reinsurance. Former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond chief 
Michael Milken also owns a minority stake in First Stratford. The exact nature 
of the problem wasn't disclosed, but sources said First Stratford's own heavy 
investments in junk bonds violated California reinsurance regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for First Executive said: "It appears to be a technical issue that 
should be resolved in the near term." A spokesman for Milken said he had not 
seen the filing but added: "Milken is not involved in the operations or 
regulatory issues involving this company." 
</P>
<P>
First Executive confirmed that 45% of its total invested assets remain in junk 
bonds, an exceptionally high proportion for an insurance company. The company 
also disclosed that it had agreed with the California regulators not to buy any 
more junk bonds without first notifying them. New York regulators have already 
severely restricted the junk bond purchases of the firm's New York unit. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the much larger than expected fourth-quarter writeoff angered 
some securities analysts, who said the company hadn't warned them about it at a 
meeting in California a month ago, when the company gave a relatively rosy 
presentation of its financial outlook. Frederic Townsend, a principal of the 
Connecticut firm Townsend &amp; Schupp, which analyzes insurance companies, 
said Monday that "this is much worse news than they told us." He added: "Their 
credibility is pretty much smashed." 
</P>
<P>
Carr refused to comment. However, the company said the rate at which customers 
are pulling money out of the company through surrenders of annuities and life 
insurance policies has begun to drop, approaching "normal" levels after a big 
surge earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The surrenders have been a major source of concern for regulators, and are 
considered the biggest threat to the company's survival. A decline in 
surrenders would therefore be good news. Carr, however, declined to give 
specific figures for the surrenders, although the company warned that Monday's 
news of larger than expected losses might temporarily cause another increase in 
surrenders. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts now are concerned about how well the company performed in this year's 
first quarter, which has already ended. The company is weeks away from 
disclosing figures. Carr refused to go into details but said: "The company 
continues to perform very well in the first quarter in what has been a 
difficult period."

Poling Says Japanese Make Better Cars: "If you look at the Japanese, I think 
we're equal to some and not as good as the best," Ford Motor Co. Chairman 
Harold A. Poling said in a story published Sunday in the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to get there." Poling said operational costs, not technology, 
put the Big Three auto makers at a disadvantage. "Can we get plants in the 
United States to produce vehicles as inexpensively as the Japanese do? You 
bet," he said. "But that requires shutting down your plants and starting from 
scratch. We can't do that. We have a work force, we have retirees, we're 
committed to pensions and we're committed to health care. And that gives us a 
serious non-competitive disadvantage going in. We have to deal with that 
somehow."

residential, non-residential and government construction projects all increased 
in February, helped for the second straight month by mild weather over much of 
the country. The department said construction spending rose 2.6% to a

T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8 billion of new three-month bills at an 
average discount rate of 7.83%, down from 7.85% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $8 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate 
of 7.81%, down from 7.83% last week. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 8.10% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,802.10, and 8.24% for a six-month bill selling for $9,605.20. 
The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government 
securities are purchased at less than face value.

Torchmark Drops Takeover Bid: Torchmark Corp. has dropped its $6.4-billion 
hostile bid for much bigger rival American General Corp. but said it still 
plans to go through with its proxy battle for the nation's fourth-largest 
insurance company. Torchmark said it has withdrawn its offer because American 
General did not formally respond to the bid by March 28. Torchmark said it 
would still nominate a slate of five candidates for election to the American 
General board at the May 2 annual meeting.

A&amp;M PRESIDENT FRIESEN RESIGNS AFTER 25 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gil Friesen, president of A&amp;M Records, has resigned after a 25-year-long 
career at the label. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at A&amp;M Records, which was purchased by Polygram Records for $500 
million last October, said that Friesen resigned under pressure from A&amp;M's 
board late last week. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said A&amp;M founders and board members Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert 
had grown unhappy with Friesen's performance. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a statement released late Monday, board Chairman Moss, said: "Herb 
and I greatly value the immeasurable contributions made by Gil over the years 
and we wish him well with his new endeavors. We're now looking forward to the 
new chapter and challenges that lie ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Friesen, who has been president of A&amp;M since 1977, could not be reached 
Monday, and a spokeswoman for the label said she did not know about Friesen's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Moss said that he would assume the position of president of 
A&amp;M and take on the day-to-day duties of running the national and 
international business dealings of the label. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1962 in trumpet player Alpert's Fairfax District garage, A&amp;M 
last year had estimated annual sales of between $220 million and $300 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hollywood-based A&amp;M had been one of the industry's most 
consistently successful labels during the 25 years Friesen spent at A&amp;M, 
the company recently has encountered difficulty finding hot new talent at a 
time when prerecorded music sales are cooling off. 
</P>
<P>
The company has just one release in the top 100, for instance -- Janet 
Jackson's "Rhythm Nation." 
</P>
<P>
And A&amp;M Records had such a bad year in 1989 that, before Jackson's October 
release, A&amp;M's biggest seller was a fluke No. 1 single by former soap opera 
star Michael Damian. 
</P>
<P>
While new owner Polygram Records has not interfered with operations at A&amp;M 
thus far, sources said Moss and Alpert intervened before Polygram used slumping 
sales as an excuse to become more actively involved in the label's management.

FEDERATED AND ALLIED STORES CUT LOSSES DURING FEBRUARY 
</P>

<P>
Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores, the American retailing 
operations of Canada's Campeau Corp. that are trying to reorganize, cut their 
losses to $45.6 million in February from the late January period. 
</P>
<P>
According to monthly statements required by the bankruptcy court overseeing the 
reorganization of the retail chains, Federated showed a loss of $29.8 million 
in February while Allied posted a $15.8-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
The losses do not include costs associated with the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 days after the bankruptcy filing in January, Federated and Allied 
reported a combined loss of $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at Federated and Allied were mostly higher in February, with the biggest 
gains coming in apparel, shoes, fashion and home accessories, the stores said. 
</P>
<P>
Federated and Allied said February's results reflected progress made with 
suppliers after the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
"We view February results as reflecting the stabilization of our department 
store operations in the post-filing period," the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
The February performance exceeded expectations for the first complete month of 
operations after the Jan. 15 filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In Chapter 11, a 
company is protected from its creditors while it attempts to reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
Maas Bros., based in Tampa, Fla., and Bon Marche of Seattle, both showed slim 
profits in the month. Boston-based Jordan Marsh, and Sterns, which operates in 
New Jersey, lost money.

B-2 COMPONENT UNDER SCRUTINY, NORTHROP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop disclosed Monday in its annual report that an electronic flight 
control system for the B-2 Stealth bomber is under investigation by the 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
The system is called the Actuator Remote Terminal, a device that the Air Force 
was forced to upgrade while the B-2 has been grounded for modifications since 
late last year. The ART system has been plagued by severe technical problems, 
according to an informed source, though the Air Force has denied that the 
system is not working properly. 
</P>
<P>
The ART plays a critical role in keeping the B-2 stable in flight. It takes 
commands from the bomber's flight control computer, relays them to flight 
control surfaces and then provides feedback information to the computer. The 
B-2, which has an unconventional all-wing design, relies on its computers to 
maintain stability and without the computers would be unstable. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said in a recent interview that "the flight control system, 
including the ART, is performing better than expected. We are taking advantage 
of the scheduled layup to upgrade the ART system. We are installing a faster 
microprocessor with a bigger memory." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Air Force would be changing the system if it were working well, 
the spokeswoman said the service wanted to "take advantage of the scheduled 
layup in the test program to upgrade the system." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop disclosed the Justice Department investigation, saying that its recent 
guilty plea on unrelated criminal charges provided for the government to drop 
certain investigations at the company but specifically not the one involving 
ART. 
</P>
<P>
The ART was produced by Lear Astronics of Santa Monica, the Air Force said. 
Lear officials did not return a reporter's call. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 is undergoing modification during a five-month grounding, but Air Force 
officials said the grounding was planned as part of the bomber's flight test 
program. The next step in the flight test program will be testing of the 
aircraft's ability to evade radar. 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop spokesman said flight tests are due to resume later this month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to changing the ART, the Air Force is changing some rivets on the 
B-2, strengthening the wings after discovering some weaknesses and installing 
an autopilot system that has not yet been tested, the Air Force spokeswoman 
said. The service is also installing improved power units that experienced 
cracks in their cases early in the test program.

HAL Inc.: The Honolulu-based parent of Hawaiian Airlines said it lost $46.9 
million in 1989, compared to an $8.8-million loss in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue declined slightly to $348.9 million. The company said operating 
expenses rose in 1989 and passenger traffic decreased due to reduced capacity. 
In addition, maintenance efforts restricted flight activity throughout the 
year.

COUNTY EMPLOYERS' WISH LIST ON WORKERS IS GOAL OF JOBS SURVEY; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: ABOUT 750 BUSINESSES WILL RECEIVE QUESTIONNAIRES ON ENTRY-LEVEL, 
SKILLED AND SEMISKILLED WORKERS IN THE FIRST SUCH STUDY.

They know that counter helpers at fast-food restaurants are in short supply and 
will continue to be so, but they're no longer all that sure about electronics 
assemblers. 
</P>
<P>
So to find out -- and to gauge industry's wants and needs for entry-level, 
skilled and semiskilled employees in Orange County for the next three years -- 
state and local employment officials are about to launch a countywide job 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, some 750 employers will receive the four-page questionnaires to be 
mailed out within the next few weeks by the Private Industry Council of Orange 
County, a job-training agency funded by both the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
If needed to achieve a 50% response rate for each of the survey's 25 employment 
categories, up to 1,500 questionnaires might ultimately be sent out, according 
to Eleanor Jordan, Orange County labor market analyst with the state Employment 
Development Department. The EDD is co-sponsoring the survey with the Private 
Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
The study, the first in what will be an annual survey program, seeks 
information about jobs that Jordan and West described as mainly hourly 
positions for which high school, trade school or two-year college diplomas are 
the maximum educational requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating in this first one on what are basically entry-level jobs 
but which pay a living wage," Jordan explained. 
</P>
<P>
"In later surveys," she added, "we might include more professional-level 
occupations, or even some highly specialized job categories. In San Mateo 
County, for example, they're doing their third survey and are seeking 
information this year on jobs pertinent to the airline industry. That's because 
they are close to San Francisco International Airport," and county job 
officials suspect that there is a demand for airline industry-related 
employment and employment training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Suspect" is the operative word in the survey program. Officials are using the 
study in part to validate suspicions about which industry segments are on the 
upswing and which are in decline. 
</P>
<P>
In job-placement and employment-training circles in Orange County, for 
instance, there "is a lot of disagreement about the electronics-assembly 
industry and whether it is declining," said Margo West, the Private Industry 
Council's survey coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"So that's one job category we want to make sure we ask about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, there has been so much publicity about the lack of skilled 
secretaries and unskilled fast-food restaurant workers in the county that there 
is not much need to ask employers about those types of jobs, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the 25 types of jobs for which employers' hiring plans are being 
solicited are bus drivers, auto mechanics, restaurant cooks, shipping clerks, 
hotel desk clerks, medical and dental assistants, licensed vocational nurses, 
computer operators, typists, sales representatives, carpenters and plumbers. 
</P>
<P>
The survey asks employers how many of a particular type of employee they have 
and how many they need; how they recruit and what they pay; how difficult it is 
to find experienced applicants; what skills they would like applicants to have, 
and what skills recently hired employees have lacked. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also asks -- after assuring the employer that all answers are 
confidential -- how many employees stay on the job for three years or more, 
what kind of fringe benefits are offered, and whether employment in the 
specific occupation is expected to grow or shrink over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Once the questionnaires are returned, the data will be compiled and published 
as the Orange County Labor Market Survey. The target date for publication "is 
sometime in the fall . . . about the same time we start preparing the 
questionnaires for the second survey," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will provide schools, employers and training programs with 
information about which jobs are in demand and which are not; about starting 
wages; the chances for promotion and the types of fringe benefits available 
within certain occupations, and about what skills are needed and which are 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
The labor market survey is part of a $3.3-million statewide program, launched 
in 1986 in San Mateo County, that ultimately will develop annual labor pool and 
wage information for the 26 counties that account for 70% of the labor force in 
the state, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only seven counties have been surveyed and only two, Los Angeles and 
San Diego, are in Southern California. Orange County currently is scheduled to 
be the only other Southland county in the program. 
</P>
<P>
LABOR MARKET INFORMATION PROGRAM 
</P>
<P>
The state Employment Development Department plans to survey Orange County 
businesses on their labor needs in certain job categories. The survey will seek 
information on training and experience, employer requirements, job outlook, 
wages and where the jobs are most needed. Among job categories to be included 
in the survey are:

Automobile mechanics

FARLEY INC. UNIT DEFAULTS ON A BIG BANK LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A division of Farley Inc. formed to acquire West Point-Pepperell Inc. said 
Monday that it had defaulted on a $796-million bank loan and would be unable to 
pay interest owed to holders of $705 million in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement increased doubts about the ability of Chicago industrialist 
William Farley to complete his $3-billion acquisition of Pepperell, the giant 
textile maker based in West Point, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Farley officials did not return telephone calls seeking details on the moves 
outlined in a three-paragraph statement issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Farley unit, West Point Acquisition Corp., had offered 
to give stock to junk bond holders in exchange for a delay in making interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
West Point Acquisition also said it had been negotiating with its lenders, a 
consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co., 
apparently in hopes of restructuring the $796-million loan they made to the 
Farley unit last year so it could buy Pepperell stock. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the loan is restructured, analysts said, Farley could be forced into 
bankruptcy proceedings or be obliged to sell assets, possibly including Fruit 
of the Loom Inc., the country's biggest underwear manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
West Point Acquisition said the defaults would not affect West Point-Pepperell, 
which continues to trade as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange 
although the Farley unit owns about 95% of its stock.

FULLERTON LAB DECERTIFIED FOR ERRORS ON PAP SMEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. health officials said Monday that they have decertified National Cancer 
Screening Laboratories -- a Fullerton medical lab that has done work for some 
Planned Parenthood chapters around the United States -- for allegedly 
misdiagnosing Pap smear samples. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Care Financing Administration informed National Cancer in a letter 
dated March 30 that Medicare and Medi-Cal programs would no longer pay for Pap 
smears done at the firm, which shut down operations last week. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Barba, HCFA's associate regional administrator in San Francisco, said the 
number of alleged misdiagnoses at National Cancer was unacceptable by federal 
quality control standards. He refused to release specifics until the lab has an 
opportunity to study the government's findings but said the percentage of 
misdiagnoses is "a substantial number." 
</P>
<P>
The Pap smear is a medical test regularly used by doctors to detect cervical 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
National Cancer owner Neil Gregory said he stands behind the quality of the Pap 
smears analyzed by his firm "100%" and accused federal and state officials of 
harassment. "There is a lot of politics involved in this," Gregory said. "It's 
a witch hunt."

Gregory said he closed National Cancer last week because the company was no 
longer profitable. "Over the last 10 months, we've been winding down the 
business," Gregory said. "The business is very, very competitive and the profit 
margins are very narrow."

National Cancer is the second Pap smear lab in California to be decertified by 
U.S. officials. Central Pathology Medical Service in Tarzana, the nation's 
largest Pap smear lab, lost Medicare and Medi-Cal funding early last year and 
was shut down by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law effective Jan. 1, the state Department of Health Services will be 
required to suspend National Cancer's medical license.

TRUMP BIDS $21.75 MILLION FOR BONWIT TELLER STORES

A consortium including real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump bid $21.75 million 
Monday for five Bonwit Teller department stores, including the chain's flagship 
outlet in Manhattan's glitzy Trump Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer's creditors rejected a request by a group that included a former 
Bonwit chief executive for a two-day extension to secure financing for a 
planned bid. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors said a delay could threaten bids by the Trump group and others. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump group, which entered its bid at a bankruptcy court hearing, proposed 
buying Bonwit Teller properties in Boston, Buffalo and Manhasset, N.Y., and 
Short Hills, N.J., in addition to the main Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
The group would forgive $269,000 in financial obligations on the stores in 
Trump Tower and Short Hills and match whatever the final bid is for liquidating 
the inventory at the Boston and Buffalo stores.

U.S. SAYS EASTERN PENSION PLANS ARE UNDER-FUNDED 
</P>

The federal agency that guarantees workers' pensions said Monday that Eastern 
Airlines pension plans are under-funded by about $1 billion and that any claims 
by the government to satisfy the shortfall could supplant other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., said that if 
Eastern were liquidated, at least $330 million of the unfunded pension 
liability would supersede the claims of Eastern's unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
But she also said the government's claims might be as much as $1 billion, or 
the full potential liability in the plans. Eastern's unsecured creditors are 
owed about $980 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, some of the creditors threatened to try to force a court-supervised 
liquidation of Eastern after it said it would not be able to pay them 50 cents 
on the dollar for their debts, as promised in February. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, which has been struggling to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, cited 
weak revenues from business travelers, who often pay higher fares and generate 
more airline profits. It also increased its projected losses. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman for the pension guaranty corporation said it hopes a solution 
other than liquidation can be found for Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
A liquidation of Eastern also could hurt Texas Air because the parent company, 
as well as Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other airline subsidiary, could be 
liable for some of the shortfall in Eastern's pensions. 
</P>
<P>
The agency spokeswoman said it would have the right to seek redress from either 
Texas Air or Continental if the Eastern pension plans were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's unsecured creditors have sought without success for over a year to 
negotiate a lasting agreement to have their claims repaid and allow the carrier 
to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

PRICE CLUB'S LACKLUSTER 2ND QUARTER IS A SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Price Co., the San Diego-based operator of 47 Price Club membership warehouses, 
announced lackluster sales and earnings for the second quarter ended March 18. 
The company reported a profit of $25.9 million on sales of $1.093 billion, up 
from the profit of $25.6 million on sales of $1.035 billion reported for the 
same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.3% increase in profit and 6% increase in sales came as something of a 
surprise to those grown accustomed to the double-digit increases that have been 
the norm for most quarters since the discount chain was founded in 1976. 
Same-store sales at Price Clubs, or those at warehouse open at least a year, 
decreased 2.2% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Price Co. chief executive Robert Price said the figure was 
affected by the fact that the recently ended quarter was one week shorter than 
the comparable period a year ago, when the company was in the process of 
shifting its fiscal year forward by one week. 
</P>
<P>
Also, sales at many existing Price Clubs are approaching maximum levels, making 
compounded sales growth more difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts noted that, even with an extra week added to the second quarter 
sales period, Price's results were disappointing contrasted with past years. Bo 
Cheadle, a retail stock analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, 
said Price's profit was 2 cents per share less than he expected and that growth 
has been hurt by competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's because Price is doing anything less well than what it's 
done in the past, but that companies like Costco and Price Savers are much 
better merchants than they were two years ago," Cheadle said. 
</P>
<P>
Price also announced plans Monday to increase the number of Price Clubs by 25% 
over the next year or so, a move that analyst Sarah Stack of Bateman Eichler, 
Hill Richards found encouraging because it will mean a corresponding increase 
in overall sales volume. 
</P>
<P>
"A majority of their East Coast openings are still ahead of them, so they are 
at the beginning of what I believe will be a multi-year, accelerated expansion" 
in markets with less competition than the hotly contested West Coast, Stack 
said.

SALK COMPANY FILES FOR FIRST STOCK OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Immune Response Corp., the San Diego biotechnology company co-founded by Jonas 
Salk that is trying to develop an AIDS vaccine, has filed for permission to 
hold an 2.2-million share initial public stock offering that could raise as 
much as $19.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company is developing an immunotherapeutic drug for patients who have 
already contracted the HIV virus, the precursor to AIDS. Now in advanced 
clinical trials at several medical centers, the drug would stimulate those 
patients' immune response systems to prevent the disease from progressing to 
full-blown AIDS, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company now has no products on the market, and its AIDS immunotherapeutic 
drug still faces at least three years of clinical tests before it is eligible 
for federal Food and Drug Administration approval. Immune Response Corp.'s $3.3 
million in 1989 revenue came from contract research payments. 
</P>
<P>
Immune Response Corp. was founded in 1987 by Salk, James Glavin, who is now the 
company's chief executive, and Dennis Carlo who is chief operating officer. 
Board chairman is William Sullivan, who in 1986 retired as chairman of 
Burroughs Wellcome, a pharmaceutical manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, the company 
said it plans to sell the shares at $7.50 to $9 each. All shares would be newly 
issued stock sold by the company. None of the offering's shares would be sold 
by existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Immune Response Corp. had planned to go public last fall, announcing an initial 
stock offering of 3.3 million shares priced at $11 to $13 each. But the 
$40-million public stock sale subsequently was called off after the stock 
market soured. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced size of the public offering as now planned is an admission by the 
company and its underwriters that current stock market conditions cannot 
support "a higher priced initial public offering at this time," said Charles 
Cashion, vice president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of 2.2 million shares would bring the total Immune Response Corp. 
outstanding shares to 11.1 million. At the median price of $8.25 a share, the 
offering would thus give the entire company a stock market value of about $91 
million. Before the offering, the company had raised a total of $28 million 
through the private sale of equity to investors. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been busy in recent months raising money by selling equity to 
institutional investors and by signing marketing and licensing deals with 
outside companies. Most recently, the company sold 1.4 million shares of its 
stock for $10 million to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance. After the 
stock offering, State Farm's shares will represent a 12.9% stake in Immune 
Response Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, the company sold a chunk of its stock to Rorer Group, a Ft. 
Washington, Pa.-based pharmaceutical company, for $10 million. The company's 
largest shareholder, Rorer will own a 13.3% stake in Immune Response Corp. 
after the offering. Rorer is also Immune Response Corp.'s joint venture partner 
in its efforts to develop the AIDS vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1988, Immune Response Corp. sold an 8.1% interest in the company to 
Colgate-Palmolive for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
In February of this year, the company signed a manufacturing and marketing deal 
with Pasteur Vaccins and its parent Institut Merieux of France that will be 
worth at least $7.5 million over three years. The French firms will also pay 
the Immune Response Corp.-Rorer joint venture a total of $15 million if it 
successfully introduces the AIDS vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for its investment, the French companies received the right to 
market the AIDS vaccine in Europe, Africa and Latin America. The French 
companies will also be the worldwide manufacturer of the Immune Response Corp. 
drug, Cashion said. 
</P>
<P>
Salk, 75, sits on the company's scientific advisory board, its board of 
directors and is a consultant. He is "in regular contact with the company," 
Cashion said. 
</P>
<P>
The company now has 31 employees at its plant on Nancy Ridge Drive in the 
Sorrento Mesa area of San Diego. The company plans to move later this year to 
larger facilities in Carlsbad. Underwriters for the stock offering are Dillon, 
Read &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Smith Barney, Harris Upham 
&amp; Co.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: UNITED EDUCATION SHOWS $29-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software Inc. of Encino, a troubled trade school 
operator whose principal subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
December 4, reported a $29-million loss in the fiscal third quarter that ended 
Oct. 31. UES lost $6.7 million in the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues in the latest quarter fell 7% -- to $18.4 million from $19.8 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months that ended in October, UES lost $33.9 million, compared 
with a $4.5-million loss in the first nine months of the previous year. 
Revenues were $56.5 million, down 9% from $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
UES said its third-quarter results included a $24.5-million pretax charge for 
reorganization costs, asset sales and writedowns. Since the bankruptcy filing, 
UES has sold six trade schools, closed four and merged two and has consolidated 
three corporate offices into one.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: INCOMNET REPORTS LOSS FOR QUARTER, GAIN FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incomnet Inc. of Westlake Village, which operates a computerized auto parts 
trading network, lost $156,688 in the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, 
despite a 137% jump in revenues to $919,528. 
</P>
<P>
In the year-earlier quarter, Incomnet had net income of $235,335 on revenues of 
$388,315. 
</P>
<P>
For the year that ended in December, Incomnet reported net income of $228,766, 
compared with a $41,687 loss in 1988. Revenues rose 70% to $2.7 million from 
$1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sam D. Schwartz, Incomnet's president, said the loss in the fourth quarter 
reflected a $168,778 charge to write off obsolete plant and equipment. The 
company, however, still managed to report a profit for the year, Schwartz said, 
because of an increased emphasis on marketing.

PUBLIC GETS A LOOK AT TRUMP'S EXPANSIVE ATLANTIC CITY CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sightseers, gamblers and news media invaded the Taj Mahal casino Monday on the 
first day Donald Trump's billion dollar gambling extravaganza opened its doors 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
But gamblers could bet only with play money while state gaming authorities 
assess the operations. 
</P>
<P>
Approval for real gambling is expected by Wednesday or Thursday, when Trump 
officially opens the Taj at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The casino is the size of two football fields and the decor could be described 
as gaudy, glittery, ostentatious, tasteless or just plain mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
It is filled with tons of white marble imported from Italy, 24 Austrian 
chandeliers, each with 5,000 pieces of cut crystal, nine huge stone elephants 
sprinkled with sparkling marble dust and 70 multicolored minarets and 
onion-shaped domes on the outer walls. 
</P>
<P>
Trump told visitors the casino was the biggest and best gambling den in the 
world and would flourish as soon as it gets its license. 
</P>
<P>
The Taj Mahal is Atlantic City's 12th gaming hall and Trump's third in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, the Taj will be good for Atlantic City," Trump said. "In the 
short run, it will bring a lot of people here who haven't visited Atlantic City 
for years. But in the intermediate term, for some of the casinos, it's going to 
be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The casino is 120,000 square feet and contains 3,000 slot machines and 160 
gaming tables. 
</P>
<P>
The entire property covers 17 acres next to the famous Atlantic City boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
It has 1,250 rooms, including a lavish penthouse suite that rents for $10,000 
per night. 
</P>
<P>
The complex employs 6,500 people, many of whom are required to dress in the 
sort of costumes one might have found in the real Taj Mahal some 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly lavish," said Charles Filo of Woodbridge, N.J., a retired truck 
dispatcher who comes to Atlantic City two or three times a week to play at the 
crap tables. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give it a try when I can get some real action and if I like it, I'll come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The real bottom line for the Taj, which needs a daily casino win of $1.3 
million to break even, is how many Charlie Filos can be attracted from the 
other casinos. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a risk here, it is just not clear which casinos are at risk," said 
Thomas Carver, president of the New Jersey Casino Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The highest grossing Casino in Atlantic City last year was Trump Plaza, with a 
daily casino win of $838,000. 
</P>
<P>
A stock market analyst who follows the casino industry was fired recently after 
Trump complained that the analyst's stock reports were overly critical of the 
new casino. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. fired gaming industry analyst 
Marvin Roffman. 
</P>
<P>
The company said Roffman had been dismissed for twice violating Janney 
Montgomery policy and withdrawing a written apology to Trump he had signed. 
</P>
<P>
Another hurdle facing the Taj and the rest of the industry is the downturn in 
casino revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of 1990, revenues fell to $420.1 million compared with 
$422.3 million in the first two months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Taj is the main attraction in Atlantic City, it should be able to break 
even, at worst. The wild card is that Atlantic City showed weakness in revenue 
growth," said Richard Reubenstone, a junk bond analyst.

BOESKY SENTENCE TO END, BUT NOT HIS TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ivan Boesky, the disgraced Wall Street financier who made millions the easy, 
illegal way -- by buying inside information -- leaves jail Wednesday, but his 
fellow arbitragers are not exactly forming a welcome-home committee. 
</P>
<P>
"If Wall Street was like the Mafia, he would be dead by now," said one big-time 
stock speculator who asked that his name not be revealed. "We didn't call him 
'Piggy' for nothing. He went down like a drowning rat, informing on all his 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Boesky received a light sentence for his role in shaping Wall Street's biggest 
insider-trading scandal in decades and is expected to be the star witness 
against those who allegedly helped him make his fortune, including junk-bond 
king Michael Milken, who is charged with racketeering and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky received three years for pleading guilty to a single charge of filing 
false information to the Securities and Exchange Commission after he agreed to 
cooperate with the government in its probe of illegal insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
He is finishing up his term at a Brooklyn halfway house and is expected to be 
released Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But his cooperation with the government is far from over. His lawyer, Robert 
McCaw, said Boesky won't decide what he will do next until he finishes 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, once one of Wall Street's top speculators concentrating on stocks of 
likely takeover companies, shocked the financial world in 1986 when he agreed 
to pay $100 million to settle insider-trading charges brought by the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky also helped prosecutors bring securities fraud charges against such big 
fish as Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which is being liquidated, and Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boesky's scheduled release date is Wednesday, he has been living at 
home for about the past 60 days, said Napoleon Johnson, program administrator 
at the halfway house. He said Boesky is part of a home confinement program 
established to reduce overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, Boesky has had to check in regularly with the halfway house 
and he is expected to visit Wednesday to sign formal release papers, said 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he'll be through with us and the Bureau of Prisons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders also said they hoped he would not try to re-enter the 
business, which he could through a loophole in the law. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought marketing and publicity to arbitrage. So a lot of people didn't 
like him for that. The arbitrage community is very secretive and likes to stay 
that way," one arbitrager said.

JACK SMITH: WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO TURN A HOUSE INTO A HOME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William H. Huber of Ventura complains that the word house seems to have 
vanished from the language, at least the language of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"My dictionary says house is 'a building for human habitation.' On the other 
hand it says a home is "the social unit formed by a family living together." 
</P>
<P>
He complains that real estate dealers invariably use the word home when 
advertising or showing a house. "They will show you an empty, never-occupied 
structure and say, 'Now here's a lovely home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Huber recalls that someone (I believe it was Edgar A. Guest) once said, "It 
takes a heap o' livin' to make a house a home." 
</P>
<P>
At least it sounds like Guest. Guest was always reducing great truths to folksy 
homilies in which he often substituted apostrophes for the terminal letters of 
words. 
</P>
<P>
I too have noticed the use of home to describe a new, unoccupied, 
never-lived-in house, and have felt mildly put out by it. I believe it came 
into practice after World War II, when every returning veteran wanted a home 
and real estate salesmen were eager to put him into one. 
</P>
<P>
My dictionary (Webster's New World) gives several definitions for home, and 
each suggests something more than just a house. It is the place where one was 
born, or where one's family lives, or simply where one hangs one's hat. House, 
on the other hand, is defined as "a building for human beings to live in." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, to quote the late, notorious New York madame Polly Adler out of context, 
"a house is not a home." 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly real estate agents use the word home exactly because it connotes 
warmth, comfort, togetherness, which is what people really want when they buy 
an arrangement of pipes, wires, fixtures, two-by-fours and shingles. One can 
hardly imagine a real estate salesperson saying, "Now this is a lovely house." 
</P>
<P>
So, as much as we may resent it, houses are conceived of, in the minds of real 
estate agents and in the minds of prospective buyers, as homes. There really 
isn't a great deal of harm in it. 
</P>
<P>
Equally fixed in the language is the term pre-owned for used in advertising 
used cars. Used cars have a bad reputation, just as used car dealer has become 
a synonym for a sharp or dishonest trader. One rarely hears the term used cars 
any more in radio ads. And, especially, one never hears of a used Mercedes 
Benz. One assumes that Mercedes Benzes are never used, merely owned. 
</P>
<P>
Used car dealers used to say that their automobiles had been driven only by 
little old ladies in Pasadena. Pre-owned, however, avoids that obvious 
falsehood. And to say that a Mercedes is pre-owned is to imply that it was 
owned by a gentleman of taste and means who gave it more attention than he gave 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when one buys a house from people who have lived in it a long time 
one may indeed be buying a home, though it is a home only to its occupants. 
Perhaps Aaron Spelling thinks of that 56,000-square-foot house he is building 
in Holmby Hills as a home, or a future home, but at this point I can't think of 
it as anything but a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The word home suggests a certain familial warmth and permanence; love, 
companionship, sharing little chores, having pets, maybe even having children, 
none of which can be guaranteed as forthcoming when one builds or buys a house. 
</P>
<P>
It will take hours of reading by the fireplace and mowing the lawn and taking 
out the trash. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what hopes Mr. Spelling has for his house, but I suspect he will 
have to do a heap o' livin' to make it into a home. 
</P>
<P>
I believe I can say my wife and I live in a home. We have lived in the same 
house for nearly 40 years, in fairly amicable circumstances. We raised two sons 
in it, and they are happily married and living in their own homes with their 
families. That ought to give us the right, I think, to call our house a home. 
</P>
<P>
I just hope my wife's plans for major remodeling don't turn it back into a 
house.

MOVIES AND BULLFIGHTS ARE SPICE OF LIFE FOR S.D. BORDER STRADDLER

The idea was to kidnap John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Texas filming 'The Alamo.' One day at lunch I made the suggestion 
to a bunch of the Mexican extras working in the picture as Santa Anna's troops. 
I didn't tell them I was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Look. Texas belonged to Mexico. It was literally stolen from us. What 
I'm going to propose to you is dangerous, so if you want to forget it, OK. . . 
.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I can get live ammunition. . . .' At this point, everyone became very tense. 
I told them: 'We get this tall guy -- what's his name? Win? Wino? We kidnap him 
and contact Washington. We'll give him back if the United States will give us 
Texas back.' 
</P>
<P>
"One colonel said he had a family to think of. Another said the U.S. Army was 
only two hours away and, 'They'll wipe us out.' I said, 'Yes. But we'll die as 
heroes.' The next day I had lunch alone." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker was Ruben Dario Padilla Colon y Magallanes, a longtime San Diegan 
reminiscing about a kaleidoscopic and sometimes fascinating life on both sides 
of the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
An interview related to Padilla's 80th birthday evoked memories of those deeds 
that have entertained him, from his career in the film industry to wearing 
pistol and badge as police chief of Texcoco, to working in tourism and politics 
and publicity in San Diego and Baja California Norte, and more. 
</P>
<P>
In his milieu, "everyone," it seems, 
</P>
<P>
knows Padilla, and he knows "everyone." He is one of those binationals common 
along the border, but nothing is common about him. Padilla is a gregarious, 
knowledgeable, humorous character, quick with a joke, a fact or a connection, a 
man known to be able to get the job done or send you to someone who can. He can 
even get you out of jail with a phone call, two at the most (Tijuana or 
Mexicali only). 
</P>
<P>
In "The Alamo," Padilla portrays Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, leading his 
soldiers at San Antonio against defenders holed up in the old mission called 
The Alamo. It was filmed in 1959 near Brackettville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many lines," Padilla said, "but Santa Anna is referred to all 
the way through, so he's a major character." 
</P>
<P>
And of course he had to ride a white horse, as was Santa Anna's custom. Former 
Texas Gov. Price Daniels provided his horse, White Cloud. Ruben Padilla had 
never ridden. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Santa Anna was to appear at the head of his troops, Michael 
Wayne, the actor's son, told Padilla, who was wearing an authentic 1836 Mexican 
army uniform: "You'd better mount." 
</P>
<P>
"Mount what?" Padilla asked. "I've never ridden before." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better tell Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla said, "You tell him." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Padilla learned to manage on horseback, although once during a 
charge he fell. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard was, 'Cut, cut, cut,' " Padilla said. "And I never heard so much 
cussing (from John Wayne) in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, originally a researcher for the film and assistant to the producer, 
was selected for the role in a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cameo part, so they needed someone famous or an unknown. Marlon Brando 
turned it down. Then they got a young fellow locally." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Widmark and Laurence Harvey, also in the film, objected because of 
the candidate's youth. Someone mentioned that Padilla had acting experience. 
Padilla continued: 
</P>
<P>
"John Wayne said, 'He doesn't look like Santa Anna.' I told him, 'You don't 
look like Jim Bowie, either.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another cameo role was filled by the famed bullfighter, Carlos Arruza, who 
portrays a Mexican lieutenant delivering a message to Bowie, Travis, Crockett 
and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Pedro Vargas refused the role. So Padilla, for many years one of 
Arruza's best friends, arranged for the matador to handle it. "Arruza got 
$20,000 for the part." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Padilla's life has centered around movie making and bullfighting. 
Friends in one field often led him to the other in a glamorous and pleasant 
ricochet. The pattern for this life may have been cut by Padilla's father, 
Dario, a Mexican importer-exporter who was a friend of the first great Mexican 
bullfighter, Rodolfo Gaona. 
</P>
<P>
However, for Ruben Padilla, born in Guadalajara on Feb. 16, 1910, the first 
personal step was his fast friendship with another star matador, Silverio 
Perez, whom he met in the early 1940s at Mexicali, where Silverio -- 
immortalized in song and politics as well as in the taurine world -- was 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla lived across the border in Calexico, where the family had moved in 1923 
after spending four years in San Francisco to avoid the terrors and confusions 
of the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hotel Caesar in Tijuana after a bullfight in the early 1940s, Padilla 
introduced Perez and other matadors to producer-director Budd Boetticher. 
</P>
<P>
"Budd had a script, "Torero," which became "The Bullfighter and the Lady," 
Padilla said. 'Wayne had just finished 'Sands of Iwo Jima' and had quite a bit 
of money. Budd contacted him about financing the movie, and Wayne was 
interested. He called me at Calexico (to arrange for bullfighters). He was very 
concerned about how much the matadors would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Yes, Mr. Wayne?' " And in that slow resonant voice, Wayne told 
Padilla: "My friends call me Duke." And that started a friendship that ended 
only with Wayne's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla arranged for the matadors. And so Wayne financed "The Bullfighter and 
the Lady" with a $450,000 budget ("A lot of money then," Padilla said). Padilla 
portrayed the impresario in a cast that included Robert Stack, Gilbert Roland, 
Katy Jurado and Virginia Grey. It was filmed in Mexico City. Naturally, there 
was an occasional party. 
</P>
<P>
"Stack liked the sauce made from maguey worms until we told him what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla portrayed Pedro in Boetticher's film "Wings of the Hawk," starring Van 
Heflin; was adviser for the bullfight sequence in "Mexican Hayride" with Abbott 
and Costello; was assistant to the producer in "The War Wagon," filmed in 
Mexico with Kirk Douglas; was in Boetticher's documentary, "Arruza," narrated 
by Anthony Quinn, whom Padilla met at Hotel Caesar, naturally, "in the early 
1940s," and enjoyed his most important role as the detective in the 
Mexican-Italian movie "Bus Ride." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla enjoyed a brief taurine career as bullring judge at Mexicali and 
Tijuana, twice having matadors arrested for allowing picadors to abuse bulls. 
And, in the 1950s, at San Diego's Balboa Stadium, he staged what was probably 
the first bloodless bullfight in California. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he helped a young American woman obtain her start in the 
entertainment world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the early 1940s," Padilla said. "The manager of the Hotel de Anza in 
Calexico called me. He said he had a problem with a guest, a young girl who 
hadn't paid her bill in three weeks. 'She says she has a contact.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I went to her room. Her name was Yolanda Warren. She was a beautiful girl, 
a brunette, about 16 or 17. I read the contract. It was for a nightclub that 
didn't exist. But she had to go to Mexico City to make a success of herself. I 
took her to eat. I advised her against going. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But Warren, from Washington state, was determined to make her mark in the 
Mexican capital. Padilla contacted Silverio Perez, who was fighting in Mexicali 
on the following Sunday. One of the matador's assistants could drive Warren to 
Mexico City as he returned. 
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday she called me from El Paso. The assistant wanted to place her in a 
brothel. I gave her some phone numbers in Mexico City and wired her some 
money." 
</P>
<P>
On her own, she obtained a job dancing at a cheap cabaret in Mexico City. Her 
style was Tahitian. One night an important politician, out slumming, was 
attracted to her. He tore some big bills in half and sent one set of the halves 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
"She spurned him. There was a big scene, big headlines in the papers. The 
cabaret became famous, and she did too." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, using a name that complemented her sensuous movements, she became the 
most famous dancer in Latin America and Asia: Tongolele. (Now living in Mexico 
City as Yolanda Montes, Tongolele made a guest appearance last fall at a 
benefit for ailing bandleader Perez Prado. Her old movies are on Channel 12.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the matador Silverio was unable to help Padilla in the Tongolele 
episode, he arranged for his friend's only experience in law enforcement. It 
was in the winter of 1967-68, during one of Silverio's three terms as mayor of 
Texcoco, the small and historic town that had been home to Netzahualcoyotl, the 
cultured Chichimeca king and poet crowned there in 1428. 
</P>
<P>
"Silverio appointed me police chief to bring tourism from Mexico City," Padilla 
said. "Fortunately, I had a great assistant chief. One night there was a 
shooting at a dance. A couple of brothers killed a couple of other men. I 
suggested sending out a posse. The assistant chief suggested taking it easy. He 
said the killers weren't professionals, that they had family in Texcoco, that 
we should play it cool. 
</P>
<P>
"In a month they were spotted in a local market. I didn't go for them. I all of 
a sudden had a cold." 
</P>
<P>
The assistant chief arrested the pair without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
For a six-year term starting in 1953, when Baja California Norte became a 
state, Padilla was the first state tourism director. In that capacity, he often 
arranged front-row bullfight seats for Quinn, Orson Welles and other Hollywood 
personalities. Simultaneously, Padilla was secretary general of the 
"middle-class" sector for Mexico's ruling political party. 
</P>
<P>
Now he lives in Mission Hills, an easy walk to the shops and restaurants in the 
vicinity of Goldfinch and Washington streets, directs U.S. publicity for the 
Tijuana bullfights and keeps in touch with his family, including brother Oscar, 
well known in local politics and in the insurance business; son Ruben Jr., also 
an insurance executive; son Marco Antonio, a U.S. Customs inspector; and two 
granddaughters and three grandsons, including Ruben, a magician. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who retained his Mexican citizenship, critically observes activities 
major and minor on both sides of the border. For instance, on the Tijuana 
traffic circles called gloriettas: 
</P>
<P>
"Approach them according to your machismo and the weight of your vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
On the future of Tijuana: 
</P>
<P>
"There is really a new Tijuana now. Tourists should feel no qualms about 
visiting. . . . The main problem is lack of water." 
</P>
<P>
And he denigrates use of the words "Hispanic" and "Chicano" to describe 
Mexicans or Mexican-Americans -- Hispanic because it belongs rightly to 
Spaniards only, he says, the other because it is recently coined and of 
uncertain origin. He is a Mexican, he will tell you, descended from Spaniards 
and Indians.

ART BUCHWALD: OILY ART OF LAYING OFF WORKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
We keep reading about people getting fired in the United States -- 6,000 auto 
workers, 4,000 computer analysts, 5,500 Drexel Burnham employees. What's wrong 
is that the newspapers never tell us how it's done. One of the top hatchet men 
in the country is Walter Widegrin, who has laid off more than a half-million 
workers in his time. 
</P>
<P>
Widegrin, known as "The Hangman," provides 24-hour service to companies that 
want to push their employees in front of the firing squad. He enjoys his work 
but pretends he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"People blame me if they're laid off, but I can't help it when business is 
lousy. Look at the Perfect Wave Suntan Oil Co. that just hired me to get rid of 
10,000 workers." 
</P>
<P>
"Did they have a problem selling suntan oil?" 
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary," Widegrin said. "Business was good -- so good that they 
decided to purchase a meatpacking plant, 1,000 VCR stores, a soccer team, a 
chain of combined carryout banks and pizza parlors, and a factory to make air 
bags for government bureaucrats. To finance their investments, they borrowed 
money from insurance companies, credit unions and the Japanese Sushi Employees' 
Pension Plan." 
</P>
<P>
"That takes guts." 
</P>
<P>
"Not if you issue a lot of junk bonds. The problem was that the executives who 
knew everything about suntan oil didn't know a damn thing about meat, soccer, 
banks, pizza or air bags. They were very determined, however, and they bought a 
large airplane to fly from one company to the other so that they could find out 
why they were losing so much money." 
</P>
<P>
"So far it doesn't sound as if they did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"What they did wrong was that they ran out of cash to pay off their debts. When 
this happened, the word went out on the street that Perfect Wave was 
overextended. Everybody was told not to advance the company any more credit. 
Without supplies it wasn't easy to make suntan oil so, like all good 
executives, they made a tough business decision to lop off 10,000 heads." 
</P>
<P>
"How can that help?" 
</P>
<P>
"It impresses Wall Street that Perfect Wave means business." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because when you're in debt, the best way to show your creditors that you 
intend to save the situation is to fire all the people that work for you. Once 
we pink-slip the workers, the banks and insurance companies will be on their 
knees begging to give us money." 
</P>
<P>
"When you lop off heads, do the executives feel the blade as well?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully not, and we always make sure that when we fire a top manager, he has 
a golden parachute. That way he doesn't get hurt when he bails out." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that they took care of all the executives at Drexel Burnham before 
the roof caved in." 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly. I was the hangman on that case -- and the big guys really came out 
smelling like a rose." 
</P>
<P>
"When you start putting the noose around the necks of the rest of the help, do 
you do it alphabetically, or by age, or by length of service?" 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have time for that. We throw a bottle of ink over the computer 
printout, and whoever gets blotted is told not to show up the next day." 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to the plane?" 
</P>
<P>
"The top boys keep it for the new company they're putting together with their 
manufacturing expertise."

INTO THE NIGHT: PHOTO OP FOR NASH COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Gazing (by invitation only) at rocker Graham Nash's photography 
collection at Sotheby's auction house on Rodeo Drive. The collection goes on 
the block April 25 in New York. To everyone's amazement, the walls of photos by 
Edward Steichen, Diane Arbus, Paul Outerbridge, Pierre Dubreuil and others 
represented just a tiny fraction of Nash's entire body of works. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Nash's friends such as David Crosby, Andy Summers of the Police 
and Judd Nelson; photography-world types such as G. Ray Hawkins with wife 
Susan, Stephen White, Weston Naef and Simon Lowinsky; plus assorted collectors 
and wanna-be collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: On the one hand, how photography collecting has grown up; on the 
other hand, how L.A. buyers are prone to buying famous-name, high-priced 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Some of this stuff is pretty esoteric and esoteric in this city is 
lost. If it isn't Herb Ritts or Mapplethorpe, forget it," said dealer Stephen 
White. 
</P>
<P>
One Moment in Time: "Part of me is in tears, but it's the part you can't see," 
said Nash with a brave smile, admitting that letting go of his collection 
wasn't all that easy. "There's 20 years of my life in here. I keep going on 
this fantasy of, OK, this is a gallery and everything's a dollar. Which ones 
would I buy? I'm very partial to Dubreuil and Outerbridge." 
</P>
<P>
Dress code: The same for men and women -- basic black jackets, shirts, leather, 
turtlenecks, jeans and suits, plus assorted footwear including woven leather 
loafers, bucks, cowboy boots and Judd Nelson's untied combat-style boots. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: A Southwestern grazing field day, beginning with chicken and shrimp 
chimichangas, tequila-marinated salmon, white sea bass ceviche, hand-shaken 
margaritas, Evian water, Diet Coke and platters of ethnically original 
"Southwestern tempura." 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "I'll just palm two of these and no one will notice," said David 
Crosby as he returned for the crab taquitos. 
</P>
<P>
Coveted: The beautiful Nash catalogues selling for $30 a pop.

Free Tickets in Paris: Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris is giving out two theater 
tickets for the price of one this week in an attempt to lure Parisians back 
into the city's 115 theaters. Although Paris boasts 100,000 seats in theaters, 
attendance has plummeted in recent years, due in part to the increasing 
popularity of television and movies, and theater ticket prices that can run 
more than $50 each. The giveaway program starts today and will last three days.

Changes at Long Beach Opera: The promised production of Debussy's "Pelleas et 
Melisande" by the Long Beach Opera, originally planned for April 28-May 6, has 
been rescheduled for April 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing "Pelleas" will be a triple bill: Pergolesi's "Livietta et Tracollo," 
Stravinsky's "L'Histoire du Soldat" and the world premiere of Mark McGurty's 
"The Anatole Cycle." Performances are April 28, May 2 and May 6. Richard 
Cordova will conduct all three operas. Steven McCarthy, administrative director 
of Long Beach Opera, explained the rescheduling of "Pelleas" as due to the 
current unavailability of Kurt Ollmann, scheduled to sing the role of Pelleas; 
Ollmann will sing the performances next year. BETH KLEID

We Want In!Dozens of angry people pounded on the doors of the Prado Museum in 
Madrid early Monday in a futile attempt to get into a wildly popular exhibition 
of Diego Velazquez paintings, which just ended its two-month run. Museum 
officials said they were forced to reopen the exhibition to latecomers twice 
Sunday night. That followed a public pledge by the museum's director that the 
show would not close until the last visitor had gone away. But about 40 people 
were turned away shortly after midnight, despite banging on the door and 
chanting "We want in!" BETH KLEID

</P>
<P>
To meet the Madonna demand, a fifth date has been added for May 16. Tickets go 
on sale Wednesday at 8 a.m. at Music Plus outlets and through Ticketmaster's

PRIZE WINNER SHOWS NO HINT OF PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Kenner, the Coronado pianist who has won a slew of awards and was the 
sole American semifinalist in last year's Van Cliburn competition, played an 
unsettling recital Friday night at San Diego State University. This was his 
first local appearance since the Texas competition; in the ensuing months the 
26-year-old musician has been pursuing further musical studies in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
That Kenner can pull off a technical tour de force is beyond question. From his 
opening Haydn Sonata in C Major, he displayed a clean, facile digital prowess 
that kept his fingers hovering over the keyboard with balletic grace. It was 
easy to explain his evident restraint in this gracious two-movement sonata to a 
proper appreciation of Classical aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
However, when his Chopin "Andante spinato and Grande Polonaise brillante" 
seemed equally circumspect and monochromatic, it raised serious questions. 
Kenner's brilliance in the "Grande Polonaise" was cold and impersonal, without 
a hint of passion, and eliminating the passion from Chopin is like purging the 
blues of melancholy. Why is this able artist hiding behind a musical facade of 
Victorian politesse? 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, he strolled elegantly through Tchaikovsky's Theme and 
Variations in F Major, crafting a series of precise miniatures. But he did not 
make a convincing case for restoring this infrequently played opus to the 
recital stage. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner completed his SDSU program with Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata in B-flat 
Minor, a large-scaled work full of typical Russian pathos. It was Kenner's 
strongest offering, and it almost pulled him out of his reclusive shell. If the 
slow middle movement was less than brooding, Kenner at least conjured a deeply 
pensive mood. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner's recital inaugurated the university's new Steinway concert grand, 
although it was heard in a pair of programs last weekend. The instrument 
displayed a certain gravity as well as focus in the critical upper ranges, but 
at crucial fortes it added an unwelcome rattle that will only be desirable for 
20th-Century scores that demand "prepared" piano.

DRAFT DODGERS GIVE RED ARMY 'SPECIAL ALARM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

With draft-dodging up eightfold in the last two years and anti-conscription 
campaigns spreading rapidly across the Soviet Union, the Red Army is worried 
about its ability to defend the country, the chief of the Soviet general staff 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, said the refusal by young men to serve 
in the armed forces is not so much a lowering of combat readiness as a threat 
to military morale, an open questioning of authority and a sharp break with 
accepted loyalties of the past. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 4 million men still under arms -- more than in any other nation -- 
and almost two-thirds of them conscripts, the 6,647 youths who refused last 
year to "serve the motherland" represented no real loss in personnel, he said. 
But he said that the growth of the number -- up from 837 in 1987 and 1,107 in 
1988 -- is very worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
"Special alarm is being caused in the army by the frequency of attempts to 
refuse military service," Moiseyev told the Communist Party newspaper Pravda. 
"The statistics are very alarming." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Soviet officials have good 
reason to be concerned about draft-dodging, as well as by the potential threat 
of large numbers of soldiers deserting. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, in the course of a visit to 
Washington last year, privately expressed concern about the problem. Yazov, 
Cheney said, "reacted negatively, very strongly" to suggestions that the Soviet 
Union could help defuse the problem of nationalism in the military by allowing 
soldiers to serve the Soviet army in the republics where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Soviet military has always been considered a unifying 
force that cuts across national and ethnic lines, Cheney said he and Yazov 
discussed "a litany of problems" but that the defense minister kept returning 
to his concern about the possibility of large numbers of desertions. 
</P>
<P>
The refusals to serve have expanded a debate in Moscow about the future of the 
Soviet military -- whether it should become a wholly professional force or 
remain based on conscription -- and on its role in society and the political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"That there is a need for changes should be clear to everyone," Lt. Gen. 
Alexander F. Katusev, the chief military prosecutor, told the youth newspaper 
Komsomolskaya Pravda last month. "Above all we must decide the function of the 
army -- whether it is a means of defense, a school for reeducation or a labor 
army, a gigantic reservoir of free manpower." 
</P>
<P>
Moiseyev, assessing the impact of both the draft-dodging and the broader debate 
over the military's role in changing society, made it clear that he thinks 
greater loyalty and sterner discipline are what are needed. The draft, 
established in 1918 and incorporated in the Soviet constitution as "an 
honorable obligation," should be preserved as a national institution, he 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Key factors, Moiseyev said, are the growing number of refusals to register for 
the draft in many of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, particularly 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and the development of an anti-conscription 
movement in many other areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Military authorities complained earlier that in Lithuania, for example, local 
governments refused to establish conscription commissions, as draft boards are 
called here, and that youths were being encouraged to join a new militia and 
border force that the republic was establishing as part of its drive for 
independence from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Local authorities in a number of republics have adopted anti-constitutional 
laws that effectively provoke young people to refuse to serve and even to 
desert," Moiseyev said. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces have also been hit by desertions over the past year, as 
servicemen left their units to return home -- to Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Lithuania, Moldavia, the Ukraine -- in times of crisis, especially ethnic 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
At least 800 and perhaps more than 1,000 Lithuanians returned to the Baltic 
republic when it declared its independence and undertook to secede from the 
Soviet Union last month. Military police have arrested more than 20 of the 
youths, and a similar number have surrendered under promises of amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
A movement called Geneva-49, which has been active in the Baltic republics, 
Georgia and other regions in recent months, tries to persuade young men not to 
serve in the Soviet army, which it denounces as an "army of occupation." The 
group justifies its position on the basis of a 1949 Geneva Convention releasing 
people from the obligation to serve in occupying armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Interior Ministry sharply criticized the group over the weekend, 
accusing it of playing on people's ignorance of the convention. 
</P>
<P>
"One must not allow any interference with the spring draft, not even in one 
settlement or town," the ministry said. "Each person must fulfill his duty to 
the motherland." 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have all adopted laws 
providing for "alternative service" for youths in their own republics. Similar 
legislation is under consideration in the southern republics of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Georgia, and anti-conscription movements are said to be active 
and winning support in Moldavia and the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Of 259 youths prosecuted for refusing military service in the Baltic republics 
last year, only two were sentenced to prison. In the Transcaucasian republics 
of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, 1,146 draft dodgers were prosecuted but 
only one was imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of religious beliefs among Soviet youth has brought a growing number 
of appeals, largely from ethnic Russians, for exemption from military service 
as conscientious objectors. Most have been placed in construction battalions 
and not required to undergo military training or take the country's military 
oath of allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
The army has faced equally serious problems in Russia itself. In one Moscow 
district during the autumn call-up last year, only 1 draftee in 10 reported as 
ordered, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda; in another only 5% showed up on the 
first day. 
</P>
<P>
When the central government ordered Russian reservists into Armenia and 
Azerbaijan to halt ethnic violence in January, strong protests by mothers and 
wives forced it to cancel the call-up. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Red Army's combat units and construction battalions, 
conscripts also serve with the 340,000-man internal security force and in 
detachments of the KGB, the security agency. 
</P>
<P>
To ease the controversy over military service, the Supreme Soviet, the 
legislature, took away the power of the defense minister to conscript the 
forces he thought necessary for the coming 6 months or a year and gave it 
instead to the Council of Ministers, the principal government executive body. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, lawmakers forced the Defense Ministry to release 176,000 university 
students from active duty ahead of time and ordered deferments for students so 
that they could complete their courses. 
</P>
<P>
Times Washington Bureau Chief Jack Nelson contributed to this story.

Boehme, 45-year-old chairman and founder of the East German Social Democrats, 
has steadfastly denied reports that he was a paid informant for the 
now-dismantled Stasi security network. 
</P>
<P>
His party stressed that Boehme's surprise resignation was not an admission of 
guilt but an attempt to concentrate on clearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of East Germans demonstrated Monday night in Dresden and Magdeburg to 
protest alleged links by members of Parliament to the Stasi and to demand that 
the legislators account for their pasts, the official ADN news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the party leadership, Boehme said that investigating Stasi files 
would be a "protracted" process and that he did not want "to burden the work of 
the party and the young democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that East Germany's newly elected Parliament is riddled with secret 
police collaborators have stirred public outrage and stalled attempts to form a 
coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Facing allegations that 10% or even more of its 400 new deputies may be 
tainted, the Volkskammer, or Parliament, plans to convene for the first time 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for a grand coalition of the election-winning Alliance for Germany and 
the Social Democrats waned Monday when the latter declared they would not join 
an administration that includes the alliance's right-wing partner, the German 
Social Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Alliance for Germany is led by the Christian Democrats, who were heavily 
backed both financially and strategically in the March 18 elections by West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's own Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Without a coalition, the Christian Democrats will fall short of the two-thirds 
majority needed in Parliament to make constitutional changes that could smooth 
the road to reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The likeliest candidate for East German prime minister, Christian Democrat 
leader Lothar de Maiziere, also has been stung by Stasi rumors. De Maiziere, a 
musician-turned-human rights lawyer, has denied ever informing for the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
His alliance overcame an election-eve confession of Stasi collaboration by 
Wolfgang Schnur, who resigned as head of Democratic Awakening, another alliance 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
Public demands that all members of Parliament be screened for Stasi pasts led 
to demonstrations last week in at least three cities. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, several thousand protesters gathered in front of the Parliament 
building, shouting "Stasi 'raus!" which means, "Stasi get out!" 
</P>
<P>
One protester hung a sign around the neck of his bulldog. "Never Again 
Muzzles," it read. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats promised before the Boehme problem to call for a 
parliamentary investigation of all deputies to expose any Stasi links. 
</P>
<P>
Boehme issued no statement Monday and did not appear at the news conference 
where his deputies announced his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Chairman Markus Meckel, who assumes Boehme's duties pending a special 
party congress, said that Boehme is suffering from an inner-ear infection and 
staying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that his resignation will affect coalition talks," said one Western 
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he simply felt something more might come up and didn't want to stand in 
the way of a speedy government, which is what this country needs desperately 
right now," the diplomat said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stasi rumors really amount to sniper activity," he added, "and I'm afraid 
we will have to live 20 years or more with this legacy from the Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
"The moral deterioration of this society goes that deep. The one thing I know 
is that we haven't seen the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
The 85,000-member Stalinist spy agency kept 109,000 paid informants, according 
to official estimates. West German intelligence has placed the number of 
tipsters much higher -- at about 2 million, or roughly one-eighth of the East 
German population. 
</P>
<P>
The Stasi routinely bugged telephones, opened mail and persecuted religious 
figures and political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Public anger began simmering anew Monday with reports that West Germany plans 
to introduce the deutschemark to East Germany at an exchange rate of one for 
two, which would effectively halve East German wages and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Trade unions called for nationwide strikes beginning at the end of the workday 
Thursday to protest the exchange rate, ADN reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kohl government insisted in Bonn that no final currency decision has been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign promises of a one-for-one exchange rate and of a quick, relatively 
easy reunification with West Germany helped sweep the Christian Democrats to 
victory in the elections here. 
</P>
<P>
East German marks trade at a rate of 5 for 1 deutschemark on the black market. 
East German wages average about 1,200 East marks per month -- far below that of 
West Germans.

DEATH PENALTY: THE SUPREME COURT SENDS HARRIS CASE TO APPEALS PANEL. DELAY OF 
WEEKS SEEN. MURDERER WAS TO HAVE GONE TO SAN QUENTIN GAS CHAMBER TODAY.

<P>
The Supreme Court refused Monday to lift a federal judge's order that blocked 
this morning's scheduled execution of Robert Alton Harris, who would have been 
the first murderer to die in California's gas chamber in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruling will delay his execution for weeks, and possibly 
months, state officials said. It does not mean, however, that Harris is 
entitled to a new trial on his guilt or his death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, thanks," Harris said when informed of the news, San Quentin prison 
officials said. He was being visited by four family members at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In a frustrating setback for the state's attorneys, the Supreme Court justices 
on a 6-3 vote ruled that Harris' case must go back to a federal appeals court 
in San Francisco for arguments over whether Harris had "competent" psychiatric 
assistance at his trial 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, was convicted of the 1978 murders of John Mayeski and Michael 
Baker, both 16. The two teen-agers were kidnaped from a fast-food restaurant 
and then shot by Harris so he could use their car to rob a bank. In early 1979, 
Harris was convicted and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
The key move to delay the execution, which had been set for 3 a.m. today, came 
Friday when Judge John T. Noonan of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
reacting to a final plea, said Harris' lawyers had raised a "debatable" claim 
that his psychiatrists failed him 11 years ago. They say Harris suffered brain 
damage as a child that could explain his violent nature. If this evidence had 
been presented to a jury, they argued, Harris might have been sentenced to life 
in prison rather than death. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether to rebuke 
Judge Noonan, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, for having intervened in 
the last moments of the Harris case. Though a majority of the high court 
strongly supports the constitutionality of the death penalty, they decided not 
to overturn Noonan. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, after Noonan had granted Harris a stay of execution, state lawyers 
filed a 40-page motion with the high court arguing that the stay should be 
lifted. They argued that Noonan had made fundamental errors in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, lawyers for Harris countered with a 30-page motion arguing that 
Noonan's decision should be accorded "great deference" because he was familiar 
with the details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
For most of Monday, the justices kept everyone in suspense. They gave no 
indication how they would rule, or even whether they would rule. But at 3:10 
p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the clerk issued a brief order on behalf of the 
court: 
</P>
<P>
"The application of the attorney general of California to vacate the (appeals 
court) order, dated March 30, 1990, staying the execution of sentence of death, 
presented to Justice (Sandra Day) O'Connor and by her referred to the court, is 
denied." 
</P>
<P>
Voting with O'Connor to leave the stay intact were Justices William J. Brennan 
Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. 
Kennedy voted to overturn Noonan's order and to allow the execution to proceed 
as planned. 
</P>
<P>
When word arrived at 3:30 p.m., the decision was cheered by anti-death penalty 
protesters outside the main gate of San Quentin prison, where Harris has been 
held on Death Row a few floors above the long-idle gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors of Harris' two teen-age victims were disconsolate. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, one day someone will just waste (Harris) in prison or something," 
said Linda Herring, an Escondido homemaker and sister of victim Michael Baker. 
"Not exactly waste him. I just hope someone in prison will take care of him. A 
criminal against a criminal. Obviously, the good people don't take care of the 
good people anymore." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "It's all a big game. The politicians are getting off on it and the 
attorneys are getting rich on it and the family victims are suffering because 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian, who as a state senator wrote the death 
penalty law under which Harris was sentenced, reacted angrily to the court 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"Still no resolution, still no justice -- just delay, delay and more delays," 
Deukmejian complained. "The facts in this case are not in dispute. Robert 
Harris murdered those two young boys in cold blood and he admits it . . . The 
federal courts -- and I should make that the federal appellate courts -- in 
this case have been anything but competent." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for governor, expressed 
what he said was his "deepest sympathy" for the families of Harris' murder 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
"The friends and family of the boys who were murdered have to relive this case 
every time it comes up for another court hearing," Van de Kamp said. "They must 
feel dismayed by the fact that in their minds justice has not been done." 
</P>
<P>
Asked several times during Monday's news conference whether he personally 
believes Harris should be executed, Van de Kamp refused to give a yes or no 
response. He has said he is personally opposed to the death penalty, but 
insists that his personal views are not interfering with his responsibility to 
enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' San Diego defense lawyer, Charles M. Sevilla, said he was "elated" to 
hear the news of the Supreme Court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla said it was impossible to guess how long it would take to decide the 
new appeal. He also predicted that Harris would prevail and see his sentence 
reduced to life in prison without the chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to win this," Sevilla said. "This is Robert's strongest appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla said he talked to Harris once Tuesday morning and again Tuesday 
afternoon after hearing from Washington, and there was a "big difference in the 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very strong and ready for what might come, but understandably very 
anxious," Sevilla said. "He was spending what he thought might be his last day 
on Earth with his family. So he was very relieved when the word came down." 
</P>
<P>
The next step in the case will be a hearing before the three-judge appeals 
court panel that had rejected a previous appeal by Harris in 1989 -- including 
Noonan of San Francisco and Judge Arthur L. Alarcon of Los Angeles and Melvin 
Brunetti of Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will review not only Harris' claim of incompetent psychiatric 
assistance but other issues his attorneys raise as well -- such as whether 
prosecutors improperly employed another jail inmate, acting as a "government 
agent," to elicit incriminating statements from Harris while he was awaiting 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will rule on whether Harris is entitled to a full-scale evidentiary 
hearing in federal District Court. The losing side in this ruling, whether it 
is the prosecution or defense, can appeal to the full, 27-member circuit court, 
and that ruling in turn could be taken back to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
If Harris wins, the evidentiary hearing would be conducted before U.S. District 
Judge William Enright in San Diego. And if Harris wins before Enright, and that 
ruling is upheld, a new penalty trial would be held in the state trial court 
that convicted Harris in 1979 and sentenced him to death. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for what was to have been the first California execution since 
Aaron Mitchell was put to death in 1967, Harris had been kept in a special cell 
on Death Row for the past week, separated from other inmates by a heavy steel 
mesh screen. 
</P>
<P>
Prison spokesman Fred Everly said Harris would be returned to his old cell "in 
the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
Harris had chosen his spiritual adviser, Chaplain Earl Smith of San Quentin, to 
spend the final moments with him. His requested final meal, according to one 
source, was to have been steak, shrimp, pizza, chicken and ice cream. As a 
final request, he asked that each of the 33 prisoners on his tier of Death Row 
receive pints of ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy," said Randall Harris, a brother who came to California last 
week to visit Harris for what he had feared would be a final time, and spent an 
anxious day Monday awaiting word from the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was a roller coaster," said Michael Laurence, of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Northern California, who joined the defense team in the past 
months. "This reaffirms my faith in the federal judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
But for the families of Mayeski and Baker, the Supreme Court decision was 
another incomprehensible legal delay. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, the mother of Mayeski, said from her home in Ramona 
that she was "disappointed -- very disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something wrong somewhere with the system . . . ," said Sanders. "I've 
never heard of any case going on this long and having so many stays of 
execution and so many appeals. I was hopeful. I thought we had a chance. But we 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was particularly puzzling because the high court had turned down 
Harris' appeals four times before, said John Mayeski's sister, Kathryn Clark, 
45, a nursing assistant from Port de Posit, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand the Supreme Court," she said. "They've denied him all the 
way up the ladder." 
</P>
<P>
She said the ordeal was torturing Sanders, her mother, who is fighting cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the medical field and I know this stress aggravates cancer," Clark 
said. "The more this continues, they may be saving Harris' life but they are 
killing my mother, in so many words." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Steve Baker, the father of Michael Baker, made the trip to 
San Quentin, hoping that within hours he would watch the execution. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, a San Diego police officer who helped arrest Harris without knowing that 
his own son was one of the victims, has made it known for years that he wants 
to watch Harris die. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see him punished," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators began arriving outside San Quentin's main gate late Monday 
morning, supplementing the handful of death penalty opponents who had staged 
around-the-clock candlelight vigils there since Feb. 6, the day Harris' 
execution date was set. 
</P>
<P>
However, their numbers were much smaller than law enforcement officials had 
expected, perhaps because of the uncertainty surrounding the scheduled 
execution. By noon, under a warm sun that sent temperatures soaring, the two 
dozen or so demonstrators still ran third in numbers behind journalists and 
police officers.

JACKSON CALLS ON MINORITIES TO TAKE UP ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that the right to breathe clean air is as basic as holding a job, the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson said Monday in Los Angeles that the time has come for 
minorities to enlist in the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd of 300 predominantly Latino students at East 
Los Angeles College, the civil rights leader was joined by Earth Day Chairman 
Denis Hayes and local political leaders and activists in calling on minorities 
to join what until now has been a mostly white middle-class movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years I've led many demonstrations -- the right to public 
accommodations, the right of open housing, the right to be free of a third 
world war, the right to register and vote," Jackson said. "Yet none of those 
rights are more basic than the right to breathe free. For unless I have the 
right to breathe, the right to drink good drinking water, no other right can be 
realized." 
</P>
<P>
Using a rhetorical style that has come to characterize his public speeches, 
Jackson led the students in repeated chants: "We have a right to breathe free. 
We have a right to breathe free. We have a right to clean drinking water. We 
have a right to breathe free. Save the children. Save the Earth. Save the 
children. Save the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
In calling on minorities to become environmental activists, Jackson hit upon a 
dilemma long acknowledged but ineffectively addressed until now by the nation's 
major environmental organizations. Their memberships consist largely of what 
Hayes called "upper-middle-class, well-educated, politically active, 35- to 
60-year-old white folks." 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson and others asserted Monday that minorities have as vital a stake in 
environmental issues as anyone, in large part because minority neighborhoods 
often are targeted for controversial facilities such as hazardous-waste 
incinerators and garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson told the cheering noontime crowd, "It does not matter to me really who 
has been involved in the environmental organizations. You don't have to be a 
part of the organization to be a part of the movement. Whoever breathes is an 
environmentalist. Whoever drinks water is an environmentalist." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) told the rally that "many of us 
have been sitting as victims in our neighborhoods . . . and we've been silent 
because we thought somehow this was a white folks' movement. Guess what? We're 
moving in. We're organizing. We're going to work because we're not going to be 
victims any more. We're going to demand justice and equality on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
William Robertson, head of the Los Angeles County AFL-CIO, said the labor 
movement also has come to realize the importance of environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I must confess that labor (10 years ago) had a division in its ranks on the 
environment," Robertson said. "Well, we've had a good awakening. We recognize 
now that even if jobs were a real concern -- which I submit they are not -- we 
must be concerned about the environment, principally for our kids and our 
grandkids." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after his speech, Jackson rejected suggestions that working for 
a better environment will cost jobs in the minority community. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfathomable to try to trade off jobs for breath because without breath 
you cannot work, and if you work and can't breathe for long, then you work for 
naught." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalism may also be good politics for the still-ambitious two-time 
presidential contender, who has had only mixed results so far in his 
long-sought desire to expand his "Rainbow Coalition" into mainstream white 
America. 
</P>
<P>
When the first Earth Day took place in 1970, Jackson said minorities were not 
involved, largely because they had just come through a grueling battle for the 
right to vote and other civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed as if the right to breathe was not a basic threat to us. It's clear 
that it is now," he said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson and Hayes both endorsed a proposed November ballot initiative, known 
as "Big Green," that would put new controls on pesticides, logging of ancient 
redwood forests, offshore oil drilling, and chemicals that damage the 
atmospheric ozone layer and accelerate global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's appearance in East Los Angeles was part of a four-state, six-city 
"National Environmental Justice" tour with Hayes leading up to the 20th 
anniversary of Earth Day on April 22.

SUSPECT IN BOY'S SLAYING FACES MULTIPLE CHARGES 
</P>

<P>
Ventura County prosecutors filed murder, kidnaping and arson charges Monday 
against Gregory Scott Smith in the death of 8-year-old Paul Bailly, whose 
gagged and burned body was found 10 days ago near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also filed special circumstances allegations -- murder in the 
course of a kidnaping -- which could result in Smith, 21, of Canoga Park, 
facing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury said "There's no question in my mind" that Smith 
was responsible for Paul's death. "If there was, we wouldn't file charges," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul died within four hours of his disappearance from a child-care program at 
Darby Avenue Elementary School in Northridge, where his mother had dropped him 
on the morning of March 23. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's body was found about noon the same day by firefighters who were 
called to extinguish a brush fire in the Santa Susana Knolls area south of Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ventura County Coroner Dr. F. Warren Lovell ruled that Paul choked 
to death on his own vomit while his mouth was taped shut. Lovell said Paul's 
body was set on fire after he died, and it did not appear that he had been 
sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bradbury said investigators are awaiting the results of tests to 
determine whether the youth was molested. 
</P>
<P>
Smith appeared for arraignment Monday but agreed to have the proceeding 
postponed until April 16 because his attorney had not had time to read the 
police report. He will continue to be held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Barry F. Hammond received a copy of the report, which Bradbury 
called "voluminous," on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith appeared in jail blues with his head bowed before Ventura Municipal Judge 
Thomas Hutchins. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond asked Hutchins for permission to appoint a co-counsel and an 
investigator to help him defend Smith, but Hutchins said he would let a 
Superior Court judge handle such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said a search warrant report and affidavits containing facts about the 
case will be sealed until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
He said the postponement will allow investigators time to finish compiling 
results from evidence tests and to interview more potential witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said that members of both Paul and Smith's families have been 
interviewed by deputy district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a good case, for reasons that will be clear at the time of the 
preliminary (hearing)." Bradbury said. "We're tying down a lot of leads we 
have."

Assembly Speaker Willie Brown objected Monday to a proposed $250 limit on gifts 
to legislators, arguing that it would prevent him from accepting free tickets 
to such events as the Academy Awards ceremony and the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful San Francisco Democrat said the Legislature should not adopt a 
limit that would interfere with "normal social interaction," such as accepting 
free tickets to the World Series, the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone in his right mind would suggest there is anything wrong 
with going to the Academy Awards," Brown said. "I think we ought to think about 
what we're doing to ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's comments came as a two-house conference committee considered adopting 
legislation that would impose stricter ethical standards on the Legislature, 
including a ban on honorariums, a limit on gifts and restrictions on lobbying 
by former legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is designed to implement the provisions of Proposition 112 on the June 
5 ballot, a measure that would require the Legislature to adopt tougher ethics 
rules and would create a salary commission empowered to give legislators a 
substantial pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the chief backer of 
the plan, has urged his colleagues to adopt legislation now so that the voters 
will know precisely what Proposition 112 will do. But Brown and other lawmakers 
have balked at adopting some of the specific restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the six-member conference committee, which includes Brown, Roberti 
and other legislative leaders, tentatively agreed to ban honorariums for 
legislators regardless of whether Proposition 112 is approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel gave preliminary approval to a provision prohibiting 
members of the State Board of Equalization from voting on matters affecting 
anyone who has contributed $250 or more to their campaigns in the preceding 12 
months. There is now nothing that prevents tax board members or legislators 
from voting on matters directly affecting their campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Proposition 112 would require the Legislature to strictly limit gifts, 
Brown proposed that the panel deem gifts over $250 to be income, and therefore 
subject to conflict-of-interest provisions. 
</P>
<P>
But lobbyists for the citizens group Common Cause argued that this plan, in 
essence, would permit honorarium payments under a different name. They called 
on the committee to prohibit all gifts that are larger than $250. 
</P>
<P>
"A $250 limit is defensible and appropriate," said James Wheaton, the 
organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Brown contended that the gift limit would be too restrictive and would keep him 
from taking free tickets to a wide range of sporting and show business events. 
Accepting the tickets, whether they are for the National Basketball Assn. 
playoffs or the World Series "has nothing to do with influence," he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker lamented that he would no longer be able to attend the Academy 
Awards ceremony for free, as he did last week. 
</P>
<P>
Responded Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson, also a member of the 
committee: "You can come to my house and watch it on TV, Mr. Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
But both Brown and Johnson agreed that one provision of the draft legislation 
holds far more potential for corruption -- a section that would allow 
legislators to accept a gift of up to 14 days lodging in a private home or 
vacation condo. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti, acting as the chairman of the committee, scheduled a hearing for 
Wednesday to consider amendments to the legislation.

YOSEMITE DEAL DESCRIBED AS MCA 'LOOTING'; 
</P>
<P>
PARKS: THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY PAID THE U.S. $635,000 IN CONCESSIONS FEES LAST 
YEAR, AN AMOUNT ENVIRONMENTALISTS TERM INADEQUATE.

Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. paid the government a $635,000 fee last year for 
the exclusive right to provide lodging, food and other services in the popular 
Sierra Nevada park, a virtual monopoly that brought in record proceeds of at 
least $84.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service revealed the fee Monday in response to media 
inquiries. In January, when the Park Service for the first time disclosed 
previous annual fees, the information led to charges that Yosemite was being 
milked for profits at a time when the park's staff was being cut back. 
</P>
<P>
The figure for sales was not provided by the Park Service but was calculated 
based on the contract that governs concessions at Yosemite. The fee is 0.75% of 
annual sales from hotel rooms, meals, souvenirs and other guest services 
provided by Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., a subsidiary of entertainment giant 
MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the formula, environmental groups estimated Monday that the company's 
Yosemite Valley operations took in at least $84.7 million in 1989. In the past 
three years, the company has paid $1.7 million in fees and -- based on the 
formula for setting the fee -- taken in at least $236.8 million 
</P>
<P>
"What it shows is that the public is getting the bad end of the deal," said 
Patricia Schifferle, western regional director of the Wilderness Society. "The 
concessionaire is basically looting the treasury." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Jensen, executive vice president of Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., 
declined Monday to confirm the figures. But he said, "We think we're a pretty 
darn good company." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society, joined by other environmental groups, is trying to form 
a nonprofit corporation to bid against Yosemite Park &amp; Curry when the park 
contract expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle said Monday that federal law makes it difficult for a competitor to 
wrest the contract away from existing concessionaires. But she said the 
Wilderness Society and other groups believe that the exclusive contract has 
given too much power to the company, which has been owned by MCA since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a question of who's in charge of the park, the Park Service or 
MCA?" Schifferle said. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly fee was set in a 30-year contract signed in 1963 that was intended 
to ensure the survival of the park's longtime family-owned concessionaire, the 
Curry Co. The terms were inherited by MCA when it took over the contract, and 
the company has resisted National Park Service efforts to renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Yosemite Park Supt. Michael Finley have 
called the fee absurdly low and said it should be raised in the next 
concessions contract. But Finley said an increase would not necessarily relieve 
budget woes at Yosemite since by law the fees are paid into the general U.S. 
treasury. Congress would have to allocate any additional money to the national 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have suggested, however, that the Park Service negotiate specific 
contributions to Yosemite as a condition of any new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Most Park Service officials rate the concessions company highly. The main 
source of controversy is objections by environmental groups and some park 
employees that its services have helped commercialize Yosemite Valley, which is 
visited by most of the 3 million annual guests to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. operates the Ahwahnee Hotel, guest lodges and a 
variety of shops and restaurants that range from the Ahwahnhee's formal dining 
room to a pizza parlor. The company also runs wilderness camps and collects 
revenue from sources as varied as the tour buses that visit Yosemite to bicycle 
rentals.

CEAUSESCU'S BROTHER DENIES MURDER AND GENOCIDE CHARGES AT START OF TRIAL

The brother of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu denied murder and genocide 
charges Monday at the beginning of one of the most high-profile trials since 
the December revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, who faces a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment if convicted, is the closest Ceausescu relative to stand trial for 
crimes stemming from Communist dictator's rule. 
</P>
<P>
He was given the name Andruta to distinguish him from his older brother, whom 
he closely resembles. 
</P>
<P>
The former chief of a security police training unit is accused of shooting to 
death seven people Dec. 21 during heavy fighting between loyalist forces and 
anti-government demonstrators. Ceausescu's regime fell the next day. He also is 
charged with inciting others to commit genocide, attempted murder and weapons 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they will produce witnesses who saw Gen. Ceausescu shoot seven 
people in the crowd outside the Intercontinental Hotel in Bucharest. He 
maintained he fired into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I fired five or six bullets -- a whole magazine -- into the air," Ceausescu 
said, adding he could not have killed anyone because he was behind the security 
forces and could not have shot through them. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, dressed in a brown-and-gray striped prison uniform, appeared 
nervous during the court appearance, grinding his teeth, rocking in his chair 
and shaking slightly. As he entered the courtroom he began to cry on seeing his 
daughter, who has not been permitted to visit her father.

CONSERVATIVES, LABOR TRADE CHARGES OVER POLL TAX RIOT;

BRITAIN: THATCHER'S ECONOMIC POLICIES COME UNDER FIRE. BUT A GOVERNMENT MP 
BLAMES 'PURE WICKEDNESS.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What began as an expression of mutual horror over weekend rioting in central 
London turned quickly to mutual recriminations in the House of Commons on 
Monday as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives traded thinly veiled 
accusations of political responsibility for the violence with the opposition 
Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
In a clear swipe at Thatcher's economic policies, Labor member of Parliament 
Tony Banks said that "extremists in the street need extremists in government." 
His colleague, Tony Benn, argued that "if you look at British history, despair 
and a sense of social injustice often lay at the roots of civil disturbances, 
and the government have a heavy responsibility for that." 
</P>
<P>
But Home Secretary David Waddington called those lawmakers and about 30 of 
their colleagues "irresponsible" for supporting a campaign to boycott an 
unpopular new local tax scheme. Some of their remarks in the Commons debate 
"could easily be interpreted . . . as an incitement to violence," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The new levy, known here as a poll tax, has become a lightning rod for growing 
opposition to the Thatcher government. It replaces local property taxes with a 
flat charge on every citizen over age 18, and opponents brand it a blatant 
giveaway to the rich at the expense of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's riot, which included what Waddington called "some of the most 
ferocious violence we have ever seen on the streets of London," occurred when 
hundreds of mostly young militants broke away from a peaceful demonstration, 
attacking police, smashing windows, looting stores and setting automobiles 
afire. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 of the 339 persons arrested during Saturday's riots appeared in court 
Monday charged with burglary, looting, theft and assault. Waddington said that 
374 police officers were injured during the melee, including 58 who required 
hospital treatment. He said that 86 civilians were hurt and that police had 
received 250 reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Both Conservative and Labor members of Parliament lashed out at the lawless 
minority they said hijacked a peaceful demonstration and praised the work of 
nearly 2,200 police officers who took part in efforts to bring the situation 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
But Waddington then criticized organizers of the demonstration for placing 
"appalling burdens" on the police and exposing Britain to "appalling damage" to 
its reputation abroad. "It really doesn't help if honorable members (of 
Parliament) exhort people to break the law," he added in a reference to the 
poll tax boycott supporters. "Do they really expect those they seek to 
influence to draw a neat distinction between one sort of lawbreaking and 
another?" 
</P>
<P>
Waddington urged that Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock "grow up and behave like 
an honorable citizen" by condemning those of his colleagues supporting the 
boycott. Kinnock, who opposes the tax but has not joined the campaign to urge 
non-payment, made no response. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's Merlyn Rees countered that the hooligans "are not the people who vote 
for me or my friends, and it is time we found out what is going wrong in a 
society where law and order is breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
Waddington, who said he had launched a "major criminal investigation" into 
those responsible for the violence, argued that there is little point in 
probing its sociology. "We can identify quite easily the cause of this violence 
-- pure wickedness!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's Dave Nellist said that if Thatcher and her fellow Conservatives "want 
to take demonstrations off the streets of London, then (they should) call a 
general election and let the people decide on the poll tax." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, who is midway through her third term of office, does not have to call 
new general elections until mid-1992, though some political opponents clearly 
hope that the poll tax rebellion will undercut her government's authority to 
such an extent that she could be forced out of office sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's George Galloway, who addressed Saturday's anti-poll tax demonstration, 
called the unpopular levy one of the "fundamental causes of this rising tide of 
anger there is in the country." And he predicted that "if the government 
doesn't change course on the poll tax it's going to be a long, hot summer." 
</P>
<P>
The poll tax has been in effect in Scotland for a year, but it became law in 
England and Wales only on Sunday. More than 1 million Scots out of 3.7 million 
subject to the tax are said to have either refused payment or to have fallen 
seriously in arrears.

YMCA GIRDS FOR A NEW PUSH IN EASTERN EUROPE

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Na Porici, a busy Prague street, stands a six-story building with a 
dilapidated swimming pool and a warren of small offices that for 40 years has 
been the headquarters of Czechoslovakia's top sports organization, known as the 
Physical Training Union. 
</P>
<P>
Built with American assistance in 1928, it originally offered up-to-date 
housing for 400 young men, as well as offices for the headquarters of the 
fast-growing Czechoslovak YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
But 11 years later, in 1939, the YMCA lost its building to the invading Germans 
and later, in 1950, to the Communists. Today, the authorities and the sports 
organization itself recognize the YMCA's renewed claim to the building but say 
they have nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is typical not only for Prague but for YMCAs throughout Eastern 
Europe. As Communist governments crumble, the YMCA is moving back in to find 
its former properties confiscated, its young men of 40 years ago dead or 
retired and a younger generation that knows nothing of the traditions the 
Christian service organization built in Europe in the first half of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the Y is signaling its determination to re-establish its work in 
Eastern Europe: 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, where the YMCA won official recognition earlier this year after 
being abolished in 1954, a specially appointed commission is working on the 
return of the buildings the organization owned. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the middle generation," observed Polish journalist Stanislaw Podemski, 
who is active in the new YMCA. "But the young people -- that is the problem. 
They have so many possibilities of engagement elsewhere. So we have no cadres, 
no donations, no special attraction, and our coffers are empty. But we have the 
will to work. We have the hope." 
</P>
<P>
In East Germany, where the Y tended to place more emphasis on sports and 
hobbies than in other parts of Eastern Europe, YMCA official Albrecht Kaul 
exulted: "We have more freedom now than we ever dreamed of. . . . We had to 
work under the roof of the church; now we also want to do missionary work." 
</P>
<P>
And here in Czechoslovakia, Lubor Drapal, a former student secretary at the Y, 
said he was surprised by the eagerness of the old members to start over. 
Membership figures are not yet available, but the organization already is 
working to set up a program that may include English-language classes as well 
as Bible study in English. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Egon Slopianka, the YMCA's European secretary, told Czechoslovak 
Deputy Prime Minister Josef Hromadka that "events have moved so fast that we do 
not yet have a strategy in place. We are not prepared for the situation, and 
the young people are in a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
Hromadka, who until assuming his present post was the head of Czechoslovakia's 
largest Protestant church, the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethern, promised 
support for the Y. 
</P>
<P>
"In past years," he said, "the church had the advantage of winning the 
sympathies of the population. Now that we have freedom, people could either 
come much closer to the churches or go off in other directions." 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA "could become a bridge between these people and the churches . . . 
could speak to the people who in the past supported the churches for political 
reasons," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the YMCA in Czechoslovakia begins around the time of World War 
I, when American officials of the organization were invited here by President 
Tomas G. Masaryk, who had been impressed by YMCA work among prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
After the armistice, 60 U.S. officials, contributing to the organization's 
typical mixture of concern for both physical and moral well-being, helped 
introduce the Czechoslovaks to such American institutions as volleyball, 
basketball, self-service canteens and Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
But now, even those who were young members after World War II are pensioners, 
Drapal said recently, adding: "Many have died, and we cannot rely on much 
voluntary financial support. Nevertheless, there is daily new evidence of 
interest in the YMCA." 
</P>
<P>
He said that one local chapter has been renewed in the city of Hradec Kralove 
and that people in Slovakia are expressing interest as well.

U.S. TO CUT TROOPS 10% IN JAPAN, S. KOREA;

<P>
MILITARY: WANING TENSIONS WITH THE SOVIETS MAKE MORE REDUCTIONS POSSIBLE, THE 
WHITE HOUSE TELLS CONGRESS.

<P>
The Bush Administration has notified congressional leaders of plans to withdraw 
10% of the 100,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and South Korea and to 
consider more reductions if U.S.-Soviet tensions continue to wane. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks, outlined in a still-secret report that offers a broad 
reassessment of military strategy in the Pacific, will result in only modest 
short-term savings in the defense budget, perhaps less than $2 billion a year, 
officials familiar with the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The study emphasizes that threats to U.S. economic and political interests in 
the Pacific remain despite revolutionary changes elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.), the chairman and ranking 
Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, ordered the study last year 
in response to critics who wanted rapid and deep cuts in U.S. forces in Asia in 
the wake of a declining Soviet menace. 
</P>
<P>
However, the report says that as the direct Soviet threat recedes, North Korea 
remains a backward, Communist-run state that threatens South Korea and U.S 
interests there. It notes that the nations of Southeast Asia are unstable and 
potentially threatening and that terrorists could strike U.S. military or 
economic targets anywhere in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The report also argues that substantial U.S. air and sea power will be required 
for the indefinite future to guard sea lanes in the region because a huge 
proportion of global commerce travels to and from the rapidly industrializing 
nations there. 
</P>
<P>
With sentiment in Congress still strong for substantial defense cutbacks around 
the globe, the proposed retrenchments are expected to be criticized for not 
going far enough. A number of Democratic lawmakers have complained loudly that 
Washington is paying billions of dollars annually to defend rapidly growing 
Asian nations that are running large trade surpluses with America. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last week informed Nunn and Warner that the 
Pentagon would not be able to meet Congress' deadline for the study, which was 
last Sunday. But Undersecretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz briefed the 
senators on its conclusions in a closed meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared after Cheney's discussions with Asian allies during a 
two-week swing through the region in February, is awaiting formal approval by 
Cheney and President Bush before the Administration submits it to Congress. 
Cheney is tentatively scheduled to present it to the Senate Armed Services 
Committee on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
The study reaffirms the U.S. military commitment to the area, but it says Japan 
and South Korea are capable of assuming a far greater share of their own and 
the region's defense burdens. 
</P>
<P>
During his February trip, Cheney told South Korean officials that the United 
States expects Seoul to double its $300 million annual contribution to the $2.4 
billion cost of maintaining 44,000 U.S. troops there. South Korean Defense 
Minister Lee Sang Hoon promised to increase his nation's share of the costs 
"within the limits of (South Korea's) ability and affordability." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Japanese officials discussed a substantial increase in Japan's share 
of the $7 billion annual cost of stationing 57,000 U.S. forces in Japan and 
Okinawa, but they did not discuss specific figures. Japan pledged to pick up 
more of the tab for utilities, construction and local labor on U.S. bases. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to note the strategic importance of large U.S. naval and 
air bases in the Philippines but also to suggest that they are replaceable 
elsewhere in the region if talks over renewal of base rights break down.

SHAMIR PLAN FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS STALLS PEACE, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THE CRITICISM REFLECTS ANGER OVER THE PREMIER'S BALKING AT EFFORTS FOR 
MIDEAST TALKS.

<P>
The Bush Administration intensified its criticism of Israel's caretaker 
government Monday, saying that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir seems determined 
to install additional roadblocks to the peace process before a new government 
can be formed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disturbing that an Israeli leadership which was unable to move forward on 
peace seems ready to move forward on new settlements," State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in response to reports that Shamir planned 
to begin work at once on five Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said Washington has long regarded the settlements as "an obstacle to 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward . . . to working with a new government that emerges soon that 
is capable of moving the peace process forward," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
The comment brought into the open some of the anger that Administration 
officials have privately directed at Shamir since the prime minister balked at 
a plan by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The Baker plan called for 
starting a step-by-step process that ultimately would lead to peace talks 
between the Israeli government and representative Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Parliament brought down Shamir's coalition government on a vote of 
no confidence last month. But under Israeli law, the prime minister and his 
right-wing Likud Party retain full powers until a new government can be formed. 
The process could take months. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler's statement, prepared in advance by senior Administration officials, 
seemed to be part of a growing debate that centers less on how to make the 
peace process work and more on how to apportion blame for its failure. 
</P>
<P>
The dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles joined in the discussion 
by sending Baker copies of a Palestine Liberation Organization publication 
suggesting that the extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany never took place. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Marvin Hier said the PLO, despite decades of anti-Israel rhetoric, had 
never previously questioned the historical record of the Holocaust. He said the 
publication, operated by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's mainline Fatah 
organization, demonstrates that a belief in PLO moderation "is a figment of 
people's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
"This puts them beyond the pale of moderation that they have been trying to 
foster for the last year," Hier added in a telephone interview from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said the Administration would not comment on Hier's 
letter until the full text of the Arabic language article could be studied. In 
a report filed earlier this month, the department discounted the often 
inflammatory anti-Israel statements attributed to some PLO affiliates because 
"the PLO is a heterogeneous organization in which constituent groups and 
individuals often express opinions differing from the consensus of the PLO as 
an organization." 
</P>
<P>
Hier said a two-part series on the Holocaust was printed Dec. 13 and Dec. 20 in 
Istiqial (Independence), a weekly magazine published by the PLO in Nicosia, 
Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
A forward by the magazine's editor said the series was intended "to expose the 
forgery of Western propaganda which is based on distortion of facts," according 
to an English translation provided by Hier. 
</P>
<P>
"The burning of the Jews in the Nazi chambers is the lie of the 20th Century," 
the article added. "Nazi camps were more civilized than Israeli prisons. Jews 
are complaining of their treatment by the Gestapo, whereas the truth is that 
they were served healthy food." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitic groups in Europe and the United States have tried for years to 
discredit the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department's latest criticism of Shamir was prompted by a statement 
Sunday by a Shamir aide, Yossi Ahimier, that the caretaker government planned 
to go ahead as soon as possible with five new settlements. They had been 
previously postponed by former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in response to 
U.S. protests. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin, a member of the centrist Labor Party, was dropped from the government 
before Shamir established his caretaker regime.

BUSH TO KEEP PUSHING TV MARTI, NOTES FEARS OF U.S. BROADCASTERS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush vowed Monday that the United States will press ahead with its 
efforts to beam television programs to Cuba, despite Cuba's successful jamming 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called on broadcast executives to support the transmissions, which have 
given rise to concerns that Cuba would retaliate by using its own transmitters 
to disrupt broadcasting over U.S. airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, broadcasters are concerned that the television signals, which 
emanate from an antenna deployed on a high-flying balloon over Florida, will 
disrupt television signal reception in southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. government's TV Marti entered its second week of test broadcasts 
aimed at Cuba, the President said in a speech to the annual convention of the 
National Assn. of Broadcasters that he understands "the concerns some of you 
have about this." 
</P>
<P>
"But I also understand that you represent the very principle TV Marti exists to 
serve -- the free flow of ideas," Bush said. "Before we are businessmen and 
women, before we are doctors, lawyers or mechanics, we are Americans. Americans 
have always stood for free speech, and we always will." 
</P>
<P>
TV Marti began its test broadcasts early in the morning of March 27, offering 
test patterns, news shows, sports and reruns of such U.S. programs as "Kate 
&amp; Allie." Within little more than 30 minutes, Cuban technicians began 
electronic jamming to interrupt the television signal, U.S. officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar test efforts were broadcast last Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday 
and again Monday. Each was jammed. 
</P>
<P>
Pledging to persist with the program, Bush said, "The voice of freedom will not 
be still as long as there is an America to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was given a polite, but not overly enthusiastic reception in his call for 
support for TV Marti. 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Edward O. Fritts, president and chief executive officer of 
the National Assn. of Broadcasters, said the group agreed with Bush on "the 
policy aspects -- the free flow of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to be with the President if possible," he said. But, he added, 
the group was concerned about "the (Fidel) Castro threat of retaliatory 
jamming." 
</P>
<P>
Fritts said that several days before TV Marti went on the air, a burst of radio 
interference from Cuba disrupted radio stations in North Carolina, South 
Carolina and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, if Cuba chooses to use a 1-million-watt transmitter, it could 
disrupt AM radio reception in nearly all states east of Utah and in eastern 
Canada.

Yemen's top tribal chief says tribalism and Islam should retain their 
importance in a multi-party political system and that tribesmen should have the 
traditional right to carry weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, pluralism is better than a one-party system, but it should be 
based on the Yemeni people's beliefs, which are mainly Islam," Sheik Abdullah 
ibn Hussein Ahmar, was quoted Monday as saying in the Emirates newspaper Al 
Ittihad. 
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen will continue to carry weapons because "we consider them part of our 
tradition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yemen and South Yemen last November agreed to a political merger and reforms 
including the right to form political parties when the two states finally 
unite.

BUFFALO RAPID TRANSIT SERVICE SET TO RESUME WITH NEW FUNDING PLAN

<P>
Erie County lawmakers Monday night agreed on a complicated funding package that 
ended a two-day shutdown of bus and rapid transit service in New York state's 
second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials said buses and light rail rapid transit cars were expected to 
resume normal operations this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year plan, which would mean $11.7 million in total aid in its first 
year, was approved by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Board of 
Commissioners after a private meeting that lasted more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski said the plan included an "infusion" of $1 
million from the city government, $750,000 from New York state from a gross 
receipt tax, and the rest from part of the county's 8% sales tax and a 
"rearrangement of certain other monies for the NFTA so they could be stable." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an earlier arrangement that was considered but not acted upon by the 
NFTA, the plan approved Monday did not include severe service cuts nor the 
layoffs of about 125 employees. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication that the package would include a fare 
increase that had been discussed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the second day of the transit shutdown, 135,000 commuters got around 
on bicycles, car pools and their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problems were reported in city high schools, where absentee rates 
soared to near 60%.

SEXISTS UNFIT FOR PRIESTHOOD, PANEL OF BISHOPS WRITES; 
</P>
<P>
CATHOLICISM: FINAL DRAFT OF PASTORAL LETTER ALSO URGES AN EXAMINATION OF HOW 
CHURCHMEN VIEW WOMEN. BUT THE BAN ON FEMALE PRIESTS IS REITERATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A panel of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops, in the final draft of a pastoral letter 
on women that was distributed Monday, said men unable to deal with women as 
equals should not be considered fit for the priesthood. But the committee's 
declaration reiterated the church ban on female priests. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, the product of nearly seven years of study, said it was "of utmost 
importance" that seminarians, priests and bishops examine whether they 
"communicate with women as co-workers and friends" rather than as "sexual 
threats or professional competitors." 
</P>
<P>
The admission of women in all ministries not requiring ordination also was 
endorsed by the committee of six bishops, which will formally present the draft 
for approval by the nation's 350 bishops at their November meeting. The panel 
was aided by five women consultants and received advice from 75,000 women in 
100 dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding women as lectors or altar servers seems "to contradict our mandate 
that women be more visibly involved in the life of our church," the committee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel urged that the Vatican soon study whether women deacons may be 
ordained and expressed hope that women will not leave Catholicism because of 
church's "consistent practice" of an all-male priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill., chairman of the bishops' committee, 
said in a telephone interview that he was "very content" with the draft. "It 
doesn't say everything we wanted to say, but it says as much as we could say 
within the boundaries of present church law," he said. Imesch did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The 99-page document praises "Christian feminists," women who are faithful to 
church teachings yet promote the status of women as equal with men. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel also cautioned against advocating, "as some radical feminist 
groups do, such aberrations as goddess worship, witchcraft, liberation from 
conformity to the sexual morality taught by the church, or acceptance of 
abortion as a legitimate choice for women under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Like the first draft of the pastoral letter, issued two years ago, the document 
talks of "the sin of sexism" that leads men to ignore the talents of women. 
</P>
<P>
"The corrosive power of the sin of sexism has seeped into the fabric of our 
civilization, invading economic and governmental systems as well as social and 
ecclesiastical structures," the panel declared. 
</P>
<P>
The final draft released by the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington on 
Monday varied little from the initial draft, except for the church's ban on 
artificial birth control. 
</P>
<P>
In the first paper, the bishops called for more discussion on the question and 
"compassion toward those who in good conscience" practice contraception. The 
second paper, acknowledging that surveys show most Catholic women defy church 
teaching, speaks of "patient instruction" so that Catholics see the truth of 
the church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Some felt in the first draft we were apologetic about the church position and 
read the call for dialogue as suggesting that our position could change," said 
Bishop Matthew Clark of Rochester, N.Y., a committee member reached by phone. 
</P>
<P>
The current draft calls upon Catholic dioceses to establish commissions on 
women and draw up plans to implement the recommendations.

Lebanon's Christian Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who rejected a 1989 Arab-brokered 
peace plan for his civil-war-torn nation, has urged Arab leaders to find a new 
deal satisfactory to all parties, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, commander of half of Lebanon's army, has written to the leaders of Saudi 
Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and to the Arab League about a peace pact, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 accord divided power between Christian Maronites and the Muslim 
majority. But it failed to include a clear timetable for a Syrian withdrawal 
from Lebanon, which was cited by Aoun as his main reason for rejecting it.

JUDGE ALLOWS VAN DE KAMP TO USE NEWSPAPER IN AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal District Court judge Monday refused to order Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate John K. Van de Kamp to remove from television a political commercial 
that uses the name of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle contended that the commercial infringed on its trademark and had 
sought a temporary restraining order to remove the ad from the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second commercial makes six specific charges about Dianne Feinstein's 
tenure as mayor of San Francisco from 1978-88. Feinstein is opposing Van de 
Kamp in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
As is common in negative political ads, the Van de Kamp spot cites articles 
from newspapers, including the Chronicle, to back up its criticisms, and the 
Chronicle name is prominent in several parts. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Northern District Court Judge John P. Vukasin Jr. viewed the ad and 
ruled Monday that the Chronicle had not proved that use of the newspaper's name 
confused viewers and made them think that it was the Chronicle instead of Van 
de Kamp making the charges against Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Kantor, representing Van de Kamp before the court, also argued that 
there was a constitutional right to free speech involved, but the judge did not 
rule on that point. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Ingram, general counsel of the Chronicle Publishing Co., said Monday, "We 
can appeal this ruling or we can proceed to trial on the merits of the ad. We 
haven't decided." 
</P>
<P>
Chronicle officials said the paper had received irate phone calls from 
subscribers who thought that the paper was attacking Feinstein in the ad.

<P>
Van de Kamp's photograph appears at the bottom at the end of the ad along with 
the legally required disclaimer that the ad was paid for by him. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Chronicle is cited in the ad, its officials were particularly upset 
with one charge made by Van de Kamp: that "hundreds died due to ambulance 
failure" while Feinstein was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
That is a reference to a report by a committee of emergency physicians that 
said the city's ambulances were too slow in responding. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Werdeger, San Francisco director of health, said that the doctors' 
report was exaggerated and that when asked to improve the ambulance service, 
Feinstein responded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle decided to sue when it saw a photograph taken from the ad in the 
Los Angeles Times in which the Chronicle nameplate appears. The Times and other 
newspapers in California have begun to provide analysis of negative 
commercials, starting with the Van de Kamp spot.

A fire that blanketed much of the downtown business district with black smoke 
ravaged an earthquake-damaged warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the blaze at the four-story brick building at 6th

spokesman said the building, which suffered damage in the October quake that 
killed 67 people in Northern California, was empty "as far as we know."

A series of fiery explosions rocked a Marine Corps maintenance facility, 
sending plumes of smoke 200 feet into the desert sky, officials and witnesses 
said. "We know there was an explosion to a warehouse and we know there were no 
injuries or casualties," said Sgt. Bill Bokholt, public affairs deputy for the 
Marine Corps Logistics Base. The explosions sparked a massive fire at a 
warehouse on the Yermo Annex, which took 90 minutes to control, Bokholt said.

Gov. George Deukmejian says that he listened to Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson's 
telephoned complaint about Charles Rothenberg being paroled there, but that if 
he had had his way there would have been no parole at all. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg is the man who was released from prison in January after serving 6 
1/2 years for the arson attack on his son, David. 
</P>
<P>
The son, now 13 and severely disfigured, lives with his mother in Orange County 
and says he does not want to see his father again. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian issued a statement Monday saying he told Wilson that Rothenberg had 
to be paroled far away from his son and that he is under 24-hour supervision 
and electronic surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also told Wilson that it is precisely because of the threat to 
public safety that convicted felons like Rothenberg represent that his 
Administration has worked to add 14 new prisons to the state system.

<P>
County political candidates on both sides of the abortion issue expressed 
outrage Monday at a questionnaire sent to them by a local anti-abortion group 
demanding formal statements of their positions. 
</P>
<P>
The Pro-Life Political Action Committee of Orange County sent the short 
questionnaire to every county government candidate, including those who are 
unopposed, a spokesperson for the group said. Included are those seeking posts 
such as district attorney, county supervisor and county recorder, the official 
responsible for filing birth and death certificates. 
</P>
<P>
The survey asks candidates' positions on a constitutional amendment banning 
abortion and on banning use of public funds for abortion-related services. The 
survey warns that those who do not return the questionnaire by April 10 will be 
listed as "refused to respond" in results that will be circulated to "thousands 
of constituents" in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates contacted by The Times on Monday said they do not plan 
to fill out the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
"You are placing candidates who do not influence the abortion issue at a 
distinct disadvantage -- regardless of their position," county recorder 
candidate Stanley L. Roach wrote to the group. Roach is refusing to reveal his 
views. "I hope your constituents have the intelligence not to be influenced by 
such a ridiculous survey. . . . If you list me in your publication as a 
'refused to respond' candidate, you will be lying. I will be hurt. You will be 
sued." 
</P>
<P>
County Recorder Lee A. Branch said he will not answer the abortion questions 
but that he was not offended by the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling them I appreciate their interest (but) that that's a personal 
issue -- that each person has to have an opinion outside this office." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Enright, one of four candidates hoping to succeed 
the recently retired Cecil Hicks, said it is inappropriate for a prosecutor to 
respond to such a survey. 
</P>
<P>
"A district attorney has to respond to the laws that are on the books. . . . I 
don't know what the other candidates did, but I discarded it," Enright said of 
the questionnaire. "It's sort of like a veiled threat -- 'You better fill it 
out or we're going to view you as a negative.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi also said he did not answer the survey. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Tom Avdeef said he had not yet received the survey but that he probably 
would not respond to it. Assistant Dist. Atty. Ed Freeman could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
County Clerk Gary Granville, who is running unopposed, said he intends to 
respond with an indication that he favors abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Granville said he thinks members of the anti-abortion group "have the right to 
ask that question, and as a public official it's my duty to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who is seeking a fifth term and whom abortion 
opponents consider an ally, said he is leaning against answering the 
questionnaire. Riley also expressed frustration with being asked to take a 
position on issues he cannot vote on as a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the airport -- there's a lot of other things going on in my life that 
are a hell of a lot more important to me right now," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Don R. Roth, who are also seeking reelection 
in June, could not be reached for comment. Christian L. Basquette, who is 
challenging Roth, said he would not answer the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Marie A. Antos, who is challenging Wieder, said she returned the questionnaire 
with the response that she would not support a ban on abortion or a prohibition 
against tax money for abortion. Antos said, however, that she resented the 
warning about failing to respond. Antos said she wrote on the bottom of her 
questionnaire: "I have the constitutional right to speak or not to speak as I 
see fit." 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire comes at a time of heightened public debate over the abortion 
issue. It has dominated elections at the state and federal levels since last 
summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling giving states more leeway in 
restricting abortions made legal in the landmark '70s Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
The survey sponsors defended their seeking positions of candidates running for 
offices that in no way influence the issue, saying that those people may 
eventually seek other offices.

1ST OK GIVEN TO LAW TO CURB GARAGE SALES 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just in time for what is considered high season for garage sales, the City 
Council has introduced a tough ordinance to restrict front-yard displays of 
furniture, appliances and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
The council has given preliminary approval to an ordinance that would restrict 
how many sales residents can hold, the hours of such sales and the kind of 
merchandise that can be sold. The law also will require residents who plan to 
hold a garage sale to file an application and pay of fee of less than $5 to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance is approved, violators could face a $500 fine or six months in 
jail, or both. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, introduced last week, was prompted by residents' complaints that 
their neighborhoods are being hurt by the traffic and parking problems 
associated with almost daily garage sales during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we were experiencing was that people had been selling new 
merchandise out of their homes," said Bonnie Kirk, the city's community 
development manager. "People were buying merchandise at the swap meet and 
holding garage sales in their homes every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will limit each household to no more than four garage sales a 
year, to be held between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., for a maximum of three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Only personal items judged "obsolete in their use" may be sold, Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
First-time offenders will be issued a warning, but a repeat violation of the 
ordinance could result in a citation. After a third citation, misdemeanor 
charges may be filed with the city attorney, which could result in jail time, 
Kirk said. However, imprisonment would result only "if someone were totally, 
blatantly ignoring" the law, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Churches, schools and charitable organizations will be exempt from the new 
restrictions, Kirk said. The ordinance is expected to gain final approval April 
10 and take effect May 10. CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

WHALE'S DEATH TIED TO NATURAL CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Biologists on Monday dissected a 15-ton gray whale that washed ashore during 
the weekend and concluded that it probably died of disease or natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-foot mammal washed ashore Sunday night, becoming the second dead whale 
to land on Orange County beaches this year. In February, an 18-foot gray whale 
was found near Laguna Beach's Victoria Beach, and authorities determined that 
its death may have been caused by a gill net, the controversial fishing 
equipment blamed for the deaths of other mammals. 
</P>
<P>
But after the dissection, biologists from the Natural History Museum of Los 
Angeles County said it is unlikely a gill net was responsible for the latest 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be natural causes, some disease or just old age," said John E. 
Heyning, assistant curator of mammals at the museum. "If it was a gill net, you 
usually get netting on it or deep cuts on it. We've found no signs of those." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, four gray whales were reported to have washed onto beaches in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties. Two had died after becoming entangled in gill nets, 
Heyning said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lewis, a museum marine biologist, said it is doubtful biologists will be 
able to determine the exact cause of death because of limited time and 
resources. To do so would mean examining the whale's stomach, a process that 
could take several days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 spectators watched Heyning and other biologists remove the whale's 
skull. As tissue was extracted, some spectators marveled at the size and 
composition of the animal, while others complained that the sight made them 
nauseous. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that I think I'm going to throw up," said Kaile Crowell, 7, of 
Seal Beach. Her mother, Cindy, 35, took Kaile and her two brothers out of 
school to see the whale. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went in the office and said, 'I'm taking them to the beach; we'll be 
back in 20 minutes,' " Cindy Crowell said. "They'll learn more out here in 
these 20 minutes than in school." 
</P>
<P>
A teacher brought her preschool class to see the whale, which was cordoned off 
by police lines after authorities used a tow truck to drag the carcass above 
the tide line. 
</P>
<P>
"I never have seen anything like it," said Apollonia Eisel of Huntington Beach. 
"This is a biggie in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Eisel grimaced as the biologists removed the whale's skull, kidneys and a 
testis, all to be used for laboratory testing that will give researchers a 
better idea of the gray whale's evolutionary and reproductive patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The skull, which was transported on a flatbed truck to Los Angeles, will add to 
the museum's collection of almost two dozen gray whale skulls, one of the 
nation's largest. "The skull can tell you more than any part of the skeleton," 
said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is somewhat of a rare event for an adult to wash up," he said. Most of 
the skulls they have found are of gray whales that have not matured. Gray 
whales, a federally protected animal on the endangered species list, are 
difficult to study at sea. They migrate from the Bering Sea to Baja California 
in the fall and back to Alaskan waters in early spring. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Seal Beach buried the carcass Monday in a 15-foot hole dug on the 
beach about a quarter-mile north of the pier.TED JOHNSON

But for Preston and the hundreds of others who spend at least one night a week 
at the Aztec, the pleasure they find knocking down pins is about to end. A sign 
posted on the bowling alley announces, "We are sad to report that effective 
June 1, Active West will be closing the doors at the Aztec Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it," Preston said between turns. The Aztec, in the 
middle of the city's entertainment corridor, will be torn down and replaced 
with a Western-style dinner theater as part of the city's redevelopment plan to 
attract tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"They just made an offer that couldn't be refused," said George Mathis, general 
manager at the Aztec for three years. Due to the increased cost of land, many 
bowling alleys that were built on prime property 20 years ago are being edged 
out. During the past few years, bowling alleys in Anaheim, Huntington Beach, La 
Mirada and La Habra have shut down. And more are slated to close. 
</P>
<P>
For the hundreds of bowlers using the centers, the trend means they must shift 
from one alley to another to find available time. The members of the Five for 
Vegas league, which draws people from as far as Laguna Niguel and Alhambra, 
have been forced to leave La Habra, Santa Fe Springs and now Buena Park, said 
Secretary Bob Ferencik. Other teams are just folding. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec's closing will affect several other groups that regularly use the 
facility, including seniors, local schools and community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
For the 30 employees of the Aztec Bowl, finding other jobs might mean moving to 
Riverside or San Bernardino counties, where land is cheaper and new alleys are 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
As for the paraphernalia from the 30-year-old bowling alley -- the 
green-and-red-striped shoes, the pins and the stacks of bowling balls -- a 
public sale might be held to appease those who want mementos, Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mathis, who used to bowl at the alley as a boy, said he worries about the 
demise of places where people can enjoy a day of "sweetheart singles," a meal 
for $3 or a good time for just $1.60 -- the price of one game. 
</P>
<P>
"What is unfortunate is (that) the attachment to the people and the community 
is lost," he said. LYNDA NATALI

POWER FIRMS FACE FIREFIGHTING COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that two local power companies have refused to pay the bill for putting 
out fires that they caused, lawyers for Orange County today will ask the Board 
of Supervisors to let them file suit in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits against San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California 
Edison Co. would seek to recover the fire-suppression costs for a pair of 
blazes in 1988 and 1989. The two fires destroyed thousands of acres of Orange 
County brush, along with a woodshed, according to documents filed with the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, they cost nearly $130,000 to fight. The companies are not being asked 
to pay for rehabilitating the areas that burned, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're alleging that they owe us for the cost of suppressing those fires," said 
Mike McGann, an Orange County battalion chief who is in charge of the Fire 
Department's investigative section. "We calculated what our actual costs were 
for these fires, and we've asked them to pay us for them." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both power companies said they would have no comment because the 
matter involves potential litigation. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said that such suits are relatively rare. McGann, who has 
served in his post for more than a year, said these were the first two 
instances that he had encountered in which companies refused to reimburse the 
county for firefighting costs. 
</P>
<P>
State law, according to Deputy County Counsel Nick Chrisos, allows fire 
departments to demand reimbursement from businesses for putting out fires . 
</P>
<P>
McGann said the Sept. 4, 1988, blaze was caused when Santa Ana winds blew a San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric power line against trees that had not been cut back 
far enough. Several thousand acres of land near Ortega Highway in South County 
burned as a result, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The county spent $112,869 fighting that fire, according to the county counsel's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The other fire, which occurred on Jan. 11, 1989, and started at 20003 Rose 
Canyon Road in Trabuco Canyon, cost $16,434 to battle. It was caused when an 
Edison power line detached from an insulator, the county counsel's report to 
the Board of Supervisors said. It burned 125 acres and a woodshed. JIM NEWTON

OFFICE FOR SCHOOLS IS A HAZARD IN QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange Unified School District this week is expected to release a study 
showing that the district's administration building is likely to collapse 
during a major earthquake, a district official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under normal, daily activity, the building is probably OK," said John Perry, 
assistant superintendent for business services. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger would come in with an earthquake of high-magnitude proportions." 
</P>
<P>
District officials have long suspected that the office building at 370 N. 
Glassell St. in Orange might not withstand a large temblor, Perry said, noting 
that previous quakes have left cracks in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Perry noted that the district is aware of structural problems and, in 
accordance with the state law, has posted signs throughout the 
unreinforced-masonry building that warn workers and visitors of the hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer's study will have the information the school board needs to 
determine whether the building is safe from a liability standpoint. The report 
is expected to conclude that moving to a new building would be cheaper than 
reinforcing the existing one.

POLICE TARGET DRIVERS ON BROOKHURST ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drivers on Brookhurst Street beware! 
</P>
<P>
Police today will begin a monthlong crackdown of even the most minor traffic 
violations on a three-mile section of the street between Adams and Warner 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called CASE, Critical Accident Suppression and Enforcement, is 
targeting a stretch of road where the number of collisions has increased 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of this effort is not to issue citations, though many times that 
will be the result of being stopped. . . . The purpose is to reduce the 
accident rate and remove unsafe drivers from the roadway," Police Sgt. Keith R. 
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
Violations, such as right of way, speed, and following too closely will be 
targeted heavily, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
Signs reading "Traffic Enforcement Ahead" will be posted along the street to 
warn drivers that officers are working in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police, who will be working with Huntington Beach police, plan 
to move to a different roadway at the end of the month.

2 SOVIETS TAKE DETOUR FOR SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Soviet officials first mentioned that they were adding two more children 
to a student exchange program, instructors and parents at the host school, 
Olympus High in Salt Lake City, were alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
As English teacher Carol Spackman recounted Monday, the Soviet officials warned 
in a communique that the two extra children had "cancer spots." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, neither 12-year-old Vladimir Kozolov nor 17-year-old Natalia Lebedeva 
has cancer. But both bear disfiguring birthmarks -- Vladimir has a dark-red 
blemish known as a "port wine stain" on his cheek and Natalia has a large black 
mark on her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
The two arrived in Salt Lake City last week with 20 other students. During 
their stay with American families, the students will tour the Grand Canyon and 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Next Monday, however, Vladimir and Natalia will take a three-day medical detour 
-- to the Beckman Laser Institute in Irvine. There they will undergo laser 
surgery aimed at erasing their birthmarks for good. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment is not available in the Soviet Union, laser institute officials 
said. There, most citizens, including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev who bears 
a "port wine stain" on his head, must accept their blemishes for life. 
</P>
<P>
But last September, as the institute's director of research, Dr. J. Stuart 
Nelson, toured the Soviet Union and lectured on laser treatments for children, 
he met Vaclav Pismenny, director of the I.V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic 
Energy and an organizer of student exchange programs. Pismenny suggested adding 
several children with birthmarks to a student exchange group he had planned. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Berns, the institute's director, agreed to treat them at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the institute has set up a Childrens Treatment Fund containing 
$22,000 for families who cannot afford the cost of laser surgery. Berns said 
next week's treatments may be the first of many for Soviet children, although, 
he added, he wants to save some of the funds for American children, too. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Berns, Nelson and Joyce Zeiler, director of nursing, flew to Salt 
Lake City to examine Vladimir and Natalia, "to make sure they had conditions we 
can treat," Berns said. 
</P>
<P>
They did, he reported, and their American hosts said both children were elated 
about their upcoming surgery. Explained Vladimir through an interpreter, "It is 
very good. . . . I want to look very fine." 
</P>
<P>
According to Berns, both surgeries will take about half an hour. He said 
Natalia's can be performed under local anesthesia with a pulsed ruby laser that 
delivers bursts of red light to break up pigment under the skin. Vladimir will 
have general anesthesia so his marred cheek can be treated with a pulsed dye 
laser; its yellow light can destroy unwanted blood vessels without harming the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
Berns hopes that after the surgeries the children can spend the night with 
Orange County families who speak Russian. But if not, the children will stay 
Tuesday night with institute officials, then return to Salt Lake City on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Both Vladimir and Natalia will probably need a second treatment, Berns said. So 
"maybe in a year or two, we'll find a way to bring them back" or perhaps by 
then, Soviet doctors will have their own lasers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berns called the medical treatment for these children a first. "Getting around 
the bureaucracy" in the Soviet Union and at the U.S. State Department is 
usually "a formidable task. But not the way we did it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing is that Prof. Pismenny is pretty high up in the Soviet 
establishment," he said. "His boss is Gorbachev's science adviser. So he can 
cut through the red tape on his end. And at our end -- we just did it. . . . 
The kids came. I didn't ask for visas. We circumvented the bureaucracy." LANIE

DANNEMEYER GOES AFTER FRANK IN LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer's campaign to expel Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) from 
the House of Representatives because of Frank's relationship with a male 
prostitute heated up Monday as Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) shot off a "Dear 
Colleague" letter to the 435 members of the House. 
</P>
<P>
The letter's two-page introduction is followed by 31 pages of attachments, 
including Dannemeyer's legal analysis, highlights from articles about the Frank 
case published in Penthouse magazine and elsewhere, and newspaper editorials 
calling for Frank's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
A Frank aide said Monday, "The vast majority of the material he (Dannemeyer) is 
circulating is recycled untruth." He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dannemeyer press secretary Paul Mero said, "This is all based on what 
Barney Frank has admitted to. We don't have to take anybody else's word other 
than Mr. Frank's." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer is perhaps the most vocal critic of homosexual rights in Congress 
and one of its most conservative members. Frank, a liberal Democrat, is one of 
two congressmen who has publicly acknowledged that he is homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Dannemeyer argues that Frank should be expelled because he has 
admitted committing sex acts that are crimes in the District of Columbia, that 
Frank allowed the prostitute to operate out of his home, and that Frank engaged 
in other dishonorable conduct. Frank has denied that he knew that the 
prostitute, Steven Gobie, was operating an escort service out of Frank's home 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mero said Dannemeyer sent the letter Monday because the House Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct, which has been considering the Frank case for 
months, is rumored to be close to a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been hearing rumblings that something is going to happen," Mero said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer will move to expel Frank once the committee makes its report to the 
House, perhaps as early as this week, Mero said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer outlined his case against Frank in a letter to House members in part 
because he is concerned that House leaders may block debate on his motion to 
expel and move to table it without discussion, Mero said. A motion to table 
requires a simple majority; a motion to expel a member requires a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's problems began last summer when he acknowledged to a Washington 
newspaper that he had hired Gobie, with whom he had once had a sexual 
relationship, as his personal assistant. Frank told the Washington Times that 
his sexual relationship with Gobie ended after Gobie began working for him. 
</P>
<P>
Frank has insisted that he paid Gobie's salary with personal funds and that 
Gobie was never on the House payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Frank himself asked the House ethics committee to investigate after the 
newspaper story appeared.

COUNCIL ADOPTS ZONE CHANGES FOR SANTA ANA ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed 20,000-seat indoor sports arena inched closer to construction 
Monday with the City Council's approval of zoning changes that will allow the 
arena to be built in an area once restricted to office and commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents and a lawyer for a group calling itself Citizens Against the 
Arena criticized the proposed sports facility that developers hope will be home 
to a professional basketball or hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Peter A. Seidenberg said his clients fear that a new arena will mean 
an increase in crime, along with new parking problems. He said the arena has 
"the potential to decrease property values." 
</P>
<P>
Although Seidenberg said a lawsuit against construction is possible, he said 
hisclients will "exhaust all administrative efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Gates, a homeowner near the proposed arena site, said the area is 
supposed to be a center for "business excellence. Now we are going to ruin it." 
</P>
<P>
The council's approval of the zoning amendments seemingly puts the Santa Ana 
arena ahead of a similar facility proposed for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
However, both cities still are negotiating with private developers to see how 
much of a public subsidy will be involved and the extent to which each city 
will share in the profits, if at all. The Santa Ana arena is to be privately 
built, operated and owned. The Anaheim arena is to be privately built and 
operated, but ultimately it would be owned by thecity. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the Santa Ana council approved three amendments, including 
one to the city's general plan, that would allow the arena to be built at the 
Santa Fe Realty's PacifiCenter Business Park. 
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's action, the city's general plan would not have allowed a 
facility as large as the arena to be built in the area. The Planning Commission 
approved the zoning amendments last week. 
</P>
<P>
Both Santa Ana and Anaheim have approved environmental impact reports for their 
arenas, but Anaheim's report has been challenged in lawsuits filed by the Los 
Angeles Rams, Anaheim Stadium Associates and a neighboring mobile home park. 
Pending trial on the lawsuits, construction and grading for the Anaheim arena 
are prohibited by court order. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Anaheim, Santa Ana is moving toward the start of the construction phase 
for its $75-million arena. The developer, Orange County Arena Partners, hopes 
to begin construction by fall. 
</P>
<P>
The arena would include 120 luxury suites, 1,000 preferred seats, a food court, 
and a restaurant club. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana facility developers now must submit a building plan to the 
Planning Commission. Once the council approves the building plan and a 
financial agreement, construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
The arena, which would be at Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street, is scheduled for 
completion by 1992.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: FERRANTE HASN'T AN ANSWER, JUST AN AVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rose Ferrante talks about her hitting as if it's no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
She shuns compliments and tries to act as if her talent is nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante, a sophomore catcher at Cypress College, is hitting .481, with eight 
triples, two home runs and 19 runs batted in for the Chargers (25-3 overall, 
9-0 in conference). She has struck out only twice in 104 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
But don't bother to ask her for any explanations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know why I'm a good hitter," she said. "I don't practice any more 
than anyone else. I just have always been able to hit since I was 8, which was 
when I started playing." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Coach Brad Pickler doesn't have any answers, either, but he has a few 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why for sure," he said, "but she is pretty strong and has more of 
a baseball-type swing. Some hitters turn their heads, but she stays right there 
with her eyes wide open." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante first played for Pickler as a freshman at Savanna High School, but her 
hitting talent was still developing. She was trying too hard to pull the ball, 
Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
After working for a year to use the entire field, Ferrante's batting average 
improved greatly. 
</P>
<P>
She was an all-Orange League player for three years and was recruited by 
Chapman College, but elected to attend Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a school person," Ferrante said. "I figured I would have more fun 
here (Cypress). And I have." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante had lots of fun last season, when she bashed pitchers for a .389 
average in 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
Her hits (70), RBIs (40), doubles (eight), triples (nine), home runs (five) and 
at-bats (180) were Cypress single-season records. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante was selected Orange Empire Conference player of the year, and Cypress 
finished second to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers finished fourth in the state tournament, and Ferrante was voted to 
the all-state team. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante took the summer off from fast-pitch softball for the first time since 
she was 8. She also played some slow-pitch softball, but for the most part 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Small package: Vincent Smalls, a former basketball standout at Saddleback 
College, is trying a new sport at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Smalls, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound forward who was a first-team all-defensive 
selection in the Western Athletic Conference this season, hopes to use his 
defensive skills as a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to go out and see what I can do," Smalls said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bob Wagner projects Smalls, a senior who will have freshman eligibility 
in football, as a pass-rushing outside linebacker and a special teams player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's certainly a good athlete," Wagner said. "He showed some toughness on the 
basketball court. Right now, we're trying to see if he can become proficient as 
a pass rusher." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said he's not concerned with Smalls' size, saying football savvy and 
technique are more important. 
</P>
<P>
Smalls will be given a one-year scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
When Saddleback Coach Bill Otta says this season's men's tennis team might be 
one of his best, it's time to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
Otta has coached Saddleback to three state titles (1984, '88 and '89). 
Saddleback has also won 11 consecutive conference championships since he took 
over in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos also own eight Southern California championships. 
</P>
<P>
This season's team is 16-0 overall, 8-0 in the Orange Empire Conference. 
Saddleback is 278-57 in duel matches under Otta. 
</P>
<P>
Hot bats: Rancho Santiago's Conrad Colby and Cypress' Doug McConathy and Troy 
Babbitt were impressive at the plate last week. 
</P>
<P>
Colby was six for 10 with a double and seven RBIs. He had six walks, scored 
four runs and raised his batting average from .404 to .428. 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt was seven for nine with two doubles, three RBIs and raised his average 
from .307 to .345. 
</P>
<P>
McConathy was six for 10, scored four runs, had two RBIs and raised his average 
from .368 to .388. 
</P>
<P>
Colby's torrid pace could be slowed by an ankle injury he suffered rounding 
second base in Saturday's 15-5 victory over Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait and see how well he responds to treatment," Rancho Santiago 
Coach Don Sneddon said. "I'm being optimistic, but his ankle isn't right now." 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast's Joe Fumi-Fiamawle, a defensive back, and Scott Sullivan, a 
linebacker, have signed to play at four-year colleges in the fall. 
Fumi-Fiamawle will attend Marshall University, and Sullivan will attend Drake.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: NO-HITTERS ARE THE NORM, NOT EXCEPTION, FOR AKAU 
</P>

Shannon Akau of Buena Park High School pitched two no-hitters last week, which 
surprised no one. 
</P>
<P>
Akau, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is a threat to pitch a no-hitter every 
time out. Dating to March 23, she had pitched three consecutive no-hitters 
until giving up four hits in a 7-2 victory over Walnut Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel (the consecutive no-hitters are) surprising. It's not even a 
topic," Buena Park Coach Brenda Sapp said. "She's a power pitcher. I can tell 
you she's up there with (former Valencia pitcher Michele) Granger. I believe 
she can throw with any college pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Akau has pitched five no-hitters this season and has a 7-1 record, helping 
Buena Park to an 8-1-1 start. In 56 innings, Akau has 89 strikeouts and only 
two walks. Her earned-run average is 0.25. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Akau pitched her second consecutive no-hitter, striking out 15 and 
walking a batter in the fourth inning, in a 3-0 victory over Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
The third one came Wednesday, when she had 11 strikeouts and a walk (in the 
first inning) in a 12-0 victory over Dominguez. That game was stopped after 
five innings because of the mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitching has 50% to 80% to do with winning," Sapp said, "but without the 
bats we couldn't win a game for Shannon." 
</P>
<P>
In three games last week, Buena Park supported Akau with 21 runs. And Akau has 
been doing her part from the batter's box too. 
</P>
<P>
She went three for three against Dominguez, including a three-run home run in 
the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a contact hitter," Akau said. "I don't think being a pitcher 
helps me anticipate what the other will throw." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Kaci Keffer won the 400-meter race (58.66 seconds), the 300 hurdles (46.43) and

the Valencia Invitational Saturday. Also for Woodbridge, Cathi Peck won the 800 
(2:23.37) and 3,200 (11:27.84). 
</P>

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PEREZ'S DUAL ROLE MAKES HIM THE TALK OF THE MOUND

Like many pitchers, Harvey Perez of Saddleback High School talks to himself on 
the baseball mound. But because Perez is also a catcher, few bring such a rare 
perspective to the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I think I'm getting out of control, I'll circle the mound and get down on 
one knee and talk to myself," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, The Times' Athlete of the Week, didn't have to say much Wednesday, when 
he held Newport Harbor hitless until allowing a single in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
He also had two hits and four runs batted in the 7-1 Sea View League victory. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Perez the catcher threw out two runners attempting to steal second base 
in a 5-3 loss to Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
This dual role is a new one for Perez, who played shortstop for Saddleback most 
of last season. He pitched in only one game and played a couple of games at 
catcher at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, Perez, the senior captain who is batting .452, has been 
required to do more, and has showed some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a ways to go because he's still trying to learn the (catching) 
position and it's a hard position to learn," said Saddleback Coach Bob Mangram 
said. "But he works hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
Before the one-hitter last week, Perez hadn't been satisfied with the way he 
has handled himself on the mound, despite an 0.88 earned-run average. "I was 
just catching so much that I really wasn't thinking about pitching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gonzales of La Habra won the 3,200 meters (9:32.68) and the 800 (1:59.30) 
and was named the athlete of the meet at the Valencia Invitational Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Pearce pitched a four-hit shutout as El Toro defeated Mission Viejo, 2-0, 
Monday and pitched two scoreless innings and earned a save Friday in a 4-1 
victory over Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parlin won the shotput (56-10 3/4) and the discus (161-5) as Esperanza 
defeated El Dorado, 101-29, in an Empire League track and field meet Thursday. 
Friday, he won the discus (171-5 1/2) at the Tustin Relays and Saturday he put 
the shot 53-9 to win the event at the Bishop Amat Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Van Reusen and Steve Snyder of Edison each had 17 kills as the Chargers 
defeated then-No. 1-ranked Huntington Beach in a Sunset League volleyball 
match.

ATTACHED DWELLINGS OUTSELL SINGLE-FAMILY UNITS IN FIRST QUARTER OF '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Condominiums, town houses and other types of attached housing outsold more 
expensive single-family houses in Orange County during the first quarter of 
1990 for the second quarter in a row, according to a report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the median price for a single-family house -- now at $335,000 -- 
is among the highest in the nation and beyond the reach of most families even 
in affluent Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A condo, by contrast, had a median cost of $176,900 during the first three 
months of the year and was even a little less expensive than last year at this 
time, reports The Meyers Group, a Corona consultant. To be exact, condos were 
8% less expensive than last year's $192,900 median. 
</P>
<P>
House prices, by contrast, continued to rise, increasing about 4% from last 
year's median $320,990. House prices were actually higher during much of 1989 
but have fallen back recently. 
</P>
<P>
Builders sold 880 houses and 1,114 attached dwellings during the first quarter 
of the year, so condos constituted 56% of the total. Sales of all new homes 
rose from the traditionally slow fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But looking back over the last year, sales of houses have slowed dramatically 
while condo sales have taken off, according to Meyers Group figures. 
</P>
<P>
Builders sold 958 condominiums during the first quarter of 1989, or 16% fewer 
than they sold in the same period this year. They sold 1,138 houses last year, 
or 23% more than they sold in this year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are condos more affordable, the report said, but builders are 
constructing them better, and a condo "is now an accepted alternative" to a 
house. Orange County buyers traditionally have demanded a typical suburban 
house with its own yard, no matter how small the yard. 
</P>
<P>
With sales slower now than at the beginning of 1989 -- an exceptionally strong 
quarter at the tail end of the 1988 sales boom -- the inventory of unsold homes 
has ballooned. 
</P>
<P>
There were nearly 3,000 houses and attached homes in builders' inventories at 
the end of the first quarter of this year, up nearly 10% from fourth-quarter 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Builders and their consultants still say the market remains strong compared to 
other parts of the nation. But they are taking some extraordinary measures to 
sell houses, measures that would have been unheard of two years ago when some 
houses sold in minutes and long lines of buyers camped in front of new 
subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Many projects," the report said, "continued to offer incentives and 
concessions to stimulate sales." 
</P>
<P>
Those incentives -- typically, help with closing costs or free extras added to 
the house -- range in value up to $25,000 per house now as builders try to get 
more people into the market and unload their inventory. 
</P>
<P>
And some builders simply "reduced pricing in lieu of incentive programs. Part 
of the increase in (sales of condominiums) can be attributed to these 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the new homes sold -- and most of the unsold inventory -- is in Orange 
County's comparatively less-developed southern half. 
</P>
<P>
There were 227 projects in the county from which buyers could choose during the 
first quarter of this year, up by 25 from late last year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
NEW HOUSING SALES TRENDS 
</P>
<P>
Housing sales in Orange County increased 23.3% in the first quarter of 1990 
over the previousthree-month period. The inventory -- houses for sale -- also 
increased 9.8% in the first quarter over the fourth quarter of 1989.

GRADCO RESTRUCTURING WILL AFFECT EARNINGS 
</P>

When Gradco Systems Inc., the Irvine supplier of paper-handling equipment for 
office copiers, earlier this month disclosed details of a major restructuring 
that included closing its Santa Ana factory, it did not mention that it would 
be taking a major charge against earnings as part of the realignment. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the charge will be nearly double the $5.6 million the company 
earned in its best year ever. 
</P>
<P>
One source said the charge will total $10 million. Gradco Chief Financial 
Officer Steve Nabor, although he would not name a specific figure, confirmed 
that it would be in that range. 
</P>
<P>
Nabor said the charge, mentioned briefly as a possibility in a February 
earnings announcement, will be disclosed when the company reports its fiscal 
fourth quarter financial results in mid-May. No matter how large the final 
figure, the earnings are not likely to be pretty: Gradco in February announced 
an unexpected loss of $1.4 million for its third quarter on a sharp decline in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring charge guarantees a large loss for the year, and shareholders 
can only hope that Gradco's plan to shift its core paper-sorter business to the 
Far East will produce better results next time around.

WARRANT ISSUED FOR MAN IN ALLEGED CAR SALES SCAM; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE OWNER OF A GARDEN GROVE FIRM IS ACCUSED OF CHEATING PEOPLE OUT OF 
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BY ACTING AS A MIDDLEMAN IN ILLEGAL AUTO DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Orange County district attorney has issued an arrest warrant for the owner 
of a Garden Grove company accused of cheating at least 20 people of thousands 
of dollars by illegally acting as a middleman on used car sales and keeping 
money that was supposed to be applied as down payments. 
</P>
<P>
A felony warrant for Thomas Charles Carter, 41, of El Toro, was issued last 
week, but the suspect had not surrendered to authorities by late Monday, said 
Rande King, senior special investigator with the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Carter worked with three Orange County men, King said, who were arrested in 
November and charged with multiple felony counts of illegal auto subleasing, 
grand theft and acting as unlicensed car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested in November were Steven Anthony Drapeau, 27, of La Mirada; 
Orlando DeLeon Pangilinan, 33, of El Toro, and Robert Jay Papkin, 34, of Costa 
Mesa. A preliminary hearing for the suspects is set for Wednesday in Orange 
County Superior Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Carter) is not a new player. We were just unable to get enough evidence to 
prove that he was the owner of this scam," King said. 
</P>
<P>
DMV investigators subpoenaed the business's records at a bank in Orange and 
were able to trace Carter as the main operator of the account, King said. 
Carter also has used the alias of Thomas Cartagena, King said. 
</P>
<P>
According to King, Carter's now-defunct Santa Ana business, U.S. Financial, 
rented an office and hired workers who made phone calls to people who were 
trying to sell their cars through newspaper advertisements. The suspects told 
the car owners that they would sell their vehicles for them to buyers who had 
bad credit histories. The buyers were told that they were to make car payments 
to the original owners for six months, after which new financing would be 
arranged. The buyers were charged $1,000 to $4,000. Of that amount, only about 
$200 per transaction was to be the suspects' fee, and the balance allegedly was 
to go toward a down payment in arranging a new loan, King said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, King said, Carter and the other suspects kept all of the fees received 
from the new buyers. 
</P>
<P>
After six months in operation in Santa Ana, Carter's outfit closed and moved in 
July to a new location at 9140 Trask Ave. in Garden Grove, operating under the 
name North American Financial, King said. "There was no way for the buyers or 
owners to legally get their money or cars back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King said the DMV is investigating three other Orange County companies, in 
Santa Ana, Irvine and Garden Grove, and one in Diamond Bar that are suspected 
of operating illegal car subleasing scams.

<P>
David Allan, former soloist and choreographer with the National Ballet of 
Canada and now free-lance choreographer, is used to working with experienced 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
So leading 16-year-old Kimberly Mikesell through his 1983 duet "Pastel" was a 
"patience exercise" for him -- but one with its own rewards. 
</P>
<P>
While the romantic relationship aspects of the piece (part of Friday's program 
in the annual dance festival of the Orange County High School of the Arts) 
might be grasped intuitively by more mature dancers, Allan found himself 
spelling them out for Mikesell -- the youngest dancer ever to perform the 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see a flame of absolute passion here," the energetic 33-year-old 
choreographer told Mikesell and her professional partner, gesturing 
flamboyantly from his chest to the ceiling during a rehearsal last week. 
</P>
<P>
Articulating the emotions that drive the jazzy 6 1/2-minute piece was for him a 
chance to "get back to the essence of what I'm really trying to say in the 
piece," Allan said later. "I find it really interesting." 
</P>
<P>
While he may occasionally need to talk Mikesell through the emotional aspects 
of the piece, he didn't soften its technical demands for her. "That's a hell of 
a step," he said during the rehearsal as she struggled with one particularly 
difficult move. "I could simplify it, but I don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
Giving young students exposure to professionals from the world of dance -- and 
a taste of the pressures in that world -- is one of the primary goals of Anita 
Mitchell, director of the school's dance program. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County High School of the Arts, now in its third year, offers an 
arts-based curriculum to about 275 of the most talented students in dance, 
music, theater and visual art from throughout Orange County and southern Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to stretch talented students," Mitchell said. "They need 
to be prepared. You can never know too much." 
</P>
<P>
This year's school dance festival includes a concert tonight with guest 
choreographer Juana Escobar and the R'Wanda Lewis Dance Company and a 
modern/jazz program Thursday with input from guest choreographer Hama. Among 
the professionals contributing to Friday's ballet program are Allan, Tomm Ruud 
of the San Francisco Ballet, and Los Angeles Chamber Ballet principal dancers 
Victoria Koenig and Laurence Blake. 
</P>
<P>
Ruud, principal character dancer and rehearsal assistant to the director for 
the San Francisco company, created a new piece for 10 dancers to music by 
Vivaldi for Friday's program. He came to the school last fall to set the first 
two movements and returned in January to set the final movement. 
</P>
<P>
While professional dancers absorb instruction faster, Ruud said in a phone 
interview from San Francisco, "it's exciting working with young, eager talent 
that wants to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Ruud praised the concept of a public high school with an emphasis in arts 
education. "I like that," he said. "I know as a child I wasn't exposed to the 
arts that much." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, the school's dance director since its opening, studied at UC Irvine 
under dance historian Olga Maynard; last year's Orange County High School of 
the Arts dance concert feted Maynard upon her retirement. Both Allan and Ruud 
contributed to the program. 
</P>
<P>
As a youth, Mitchell attended a respected arts high school -- North Carolina 
School of the Arts. "I came out of that environment, so I know where this 
school can go," said Mitchell, an intense young woman who admits that she is 
aggressive in recruiting dance professionals to teach at her school. "I don't 
shy away from challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Her ideal guest artist is one who combines skill as choreographer, coach and 
teacher, and who can treat the young dancers with sensitivity ("Some people out 
there are ogres," she said) without pampering them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to prop up any dancer with praise," Mitchell said. "They have to 
be hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County High School of the Arts' annual dance festival begins today 
in the Margaret Webb Performing Arts Center at Los Alamitos High School, 3591 
Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos, at 7:30 p.m. with a program of international folk 
dance by the R'Wanda Lewis Dance Company with Juana Escobar. The festival 
continues Thursday with a modern and jazz program and Friday with ballet. 
Tickets for each program: $5 to $6. Information: (714) 988-7581.

<P>
The Alternative Repertory Theatre's call for would-be directors has gone 
virtually unheeded, forcing the storefront theater here to drop its ambitious 
plan for "Directors Fest '90" in June. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, which would have enabled local amateurs to test their skills by 
staging new or previously produced plays, drew only six applicants, about a 
third of the 15 needed for the theater "just to break even," producer Kathleen 
Bryson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we got such a small response," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson speculated that the rules of the festival may have been too demanding. 
ART required proof of stage rights for each project and a $100 fee from each 
applicant to help underwrite the cost of production. The cancellation is ART's 
second in two weeks, and it comes in the midst of what Bryson called "our best 
season to date." In mid-March, casting difficulties forced the theater to drop 
plans for the West Coast premiere of Lorna Hill's "Yalla Bitch," a 
coming-of-age musical about a black woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Yalla Bitch" was replaced by Peter Nichols' "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg," a 
harrowing 1967 comedy about a British couple coping with a severely handicapped 
child. Bryson said "Joe Egg" will now run from April 20 to June 16, two weeks 
beyond the previously announced dates. It will be the third and final 
production of the ART season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very frustrating," Bryson said, "because these back-to-back 
cancellations have been completely out of our control. The director's festival 
is not an idea we will throw away completely. But if we do try it again, we 
won't schedule it in a main-stage slot." 
</P>
<P>
ART's 200 season ticket holders will be offered extra seats for "Joe Egg" to 
compensate them for the lack of a fourth subscription offering. 
</P>
<P>
The season opened with "Lysistrata" and continued with "Waiting for Godot," the 
two most popular shows in ART's three-year history. Bryson said the 29 
performances of "Godot," which recently closed, played to 1,638 people, 
representing an average capacity of 70% for the 61-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
At this time last year, attendance at ART was so dismal that the theater was 
faced with a financial crisis that nearly shut its doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in the same position now at all," Bryson said. "We have enough money 
in the bank to say we definitely will have a fourth season. We're disappointed 
the idea for the festival didn't work. But we can move on." 
</P>
<P>
ART recently improved its financial outlook by acquiring tax-exempt status from 
the state, she said. The theater is now waiting for similar approval from the 
federal government, which will enable it to seek government grants and 
tax-deductible contributions. 
</P>
<P>
LUCAS' PRELUDE: On a recent play-scouting trip to Manhattan, David Emmes, 
producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, passed up 
Circle Repertory's off-Broadway production of Craig Lucas' "Prelude to a Kiss," 
which has been getting raves from the New York theater critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd wait to see it on Broadway," Emmes said Monday, although Lucas' 
comedy was commissioned by SCR and given its world premiere there in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Circle Rep production, with Alec Baldwin and Mary Louise Parker in the 
starring roles, closed Sunday. It will reopen May 1 at the Helen Hayes Theatre 
(with Timothy Hutton replacing Baldwin) a day before the deadline for Tony 
award eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Rene, who directed both the SCR and Circle Rep productions, will restage 
"Prelude," which has gone through many changes since its SCR premiere. In Costa 
Mesa, the play had three acts and 22 characters. It now has two acts and 12 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
SCR won't reap anything from the Broadway box-office receipts. "We share in 
subsidiary rights, including stock or film rights," Emmes said. "What that 
doesn't include is participation in the gross of a commercial production." 
</P>
<P>
CALLING ALL NERDS: The Laguna Playhouse is holding an essay contest -- "The 
Most Unforgettable Nerd I've Ever Met" -- to promote Larry Shue's "The Nerd," 
which opens at the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach May 1. The deadline is April 
27. Essays should be limited to 50 words. The winner will receive four tickets 
to the show and the opening-night champagne reception. The runner-up will 
receive two tickets for any night during the rest of the run.

CURTAIN IS ABOUT TO FALL ON STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
When final exams are over and the Orange County High School of the Arts 
finishes its third academic year on June 30, the school will face a test of its 
own: a test of its ability to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education has been providing about half the school's 
operating money, to the tune of $194,700 the first year, $221,900 the second 
and $275,000 this year. But those seed grants came with a three-year limit, and 
on June 30 the ride is over. 
</P>
<P>
The school, on the campus of Los Alamitos High School, will continue to receive 
a set amount from the city school district for each fully enrolled student. But 
to make up for the lack of state funding and still maintain its current level 
of course offerings, executive director Ralph Opacic said, the school must 
raise about $300,000 a year. There are no tuition charges at the school. 
</P>
<P>
A foundation was established in November, 1988, to come up with ways of finding 
the money, and a development director was hired last October. A fund-raising 
campaign started in January of this year; the goal is to raise $95,000 in 
private and corporate donations by June 30 and an additional $200,000 over the 
course of the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has raised $30,000 so far, Opacic said, adding that several 
requests for major donations are still in the "submission stage." Still, Opacic 
calls the response so far "tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that the crucial test in establishing a successful long-term 
fund-raising effort will be persuading the community that the high school is a 
"vital, integral part of arts development in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The school, which meets from 2:30 to 5 p.m., opened in 1987 with about 125 
students; this year it has 275. About 200 attend full-time, taking their 
academic classes at Los Alamitos High. The rest attend other high schools 
during the day and come to the High School of the Arts in the afternoon, or on 
Sunday to participate in the South Coast Youth Symphony. The school receives no 
district funds for the part-time students. 
</P>
<P>
Opacic said the school will accept between 350 and 400 students for the coming 
academic year, which he feels is the maximum with the available facilities and 
an acceptable teacher-student ratio. Applications are still being accepted; 450 
have already been received. Auditions started in March and will continue 
through May. 
</P>
<P>
If the school falls short of its fund-raising goals, Opacic said, the number of 
students accepted will not be affected, but the school will have to scale down 
its course offerings. "We will diminish the scope but maintain the quality," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Planned facility improvements and curriculum changes have already been funded 
out of this year's state grant. These include: 
</P>
<P>
* Expansion of the dance program in September. Classical and modern-dance 
classes will be augmented by classes in commercial-dance forms -- "that's 
MTV-type of dancing," in Opacic's words. Ray Lozano, an assistant to pop singer 
Paula Abdul, will head the program; professional choreographers and agents will 
help students market skills. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a new visual arts lab, to give advanced students a place to 
work on independent projects. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a new instrumental music rehearsal room, with storage space 
for the technical-theater program. 
</P>
<P>
* Addition of portable classrooms, which will allow the return of a 
musical-theater program that had to move off campus for lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
* Ongoing development of a long-range facility plan, which includes provisions 
for additional technical-theater work space and extra multi-use rehearsal 
space. RICK VANDERKNYFF

A Texas guitar hero whose sonic palette isn't limited to 5,283 shades of blues? 
Sounds almost unbelievable? Yep, and -- not coincidentally -- that's a 
semi-accurate assessment of the git-tar star himself, Eric Johnson, who plays 
the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the impending release of "Ha Via Musicom" -- only his second 
major-label LP in five years -- at the Roxy on Sunday, Johnson wowed the crowd 
with a tone that could cut diamondback rattlesnakes and walk between the 
slices, with an ear-popping, sophisticated sense of harmonics, and with 
endless, cascading flurries of 32nd notes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also sings, in a plaintive tenor that matches his rail-thin, blond 
page-boy looks. Supported by bassist Kyle Brock and drummer Tommy Taylor, 
Johnson's vocal numbers took on an epic sweep -- and a slightly harder edge -- 
than their studio counterparts. Play it purty, son. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Johnson is nuthin' but versatile, replicating pedal steel rags and 
pausing for a pair of acoustic numbers, before genuflecting to the ghost of 
Jimi Hendrix for the final encore of "Spanish Castle Magic." 
</P>
<P>
A picker's picker, fer sure -- three quarters of the guitar aces in the full 
house looked like they wanted to go home and practice -- but his 
never-lose-the-beauty-of-the-melody approach may win him a wider audience -- 
providing Johnson takes something less than five years before his next local 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Johnson plays tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, 
San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information: (714) 496-8930.

FIRST PERSON: HE WON'T BE KEEPER TO HIS BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BEAN, Bean is a Los Angeles free-lance writer and an editorial 
assistant for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, my mother called me from Texas to tell me a story I could hardly 
believe. She recounted how one of my brothers had come to her home, beaten my 
sister and threatened her life. She said that he had gone crazy, and that crack 
cocaine was the reason. 
</P>
<P>
I had made a decision not to use drugs when I was a senior in high school. But 
I had known for a while that my older brother used drugs heavily, because I had 
lived with him years ago, when he was using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Crack, made by cooking cocaine and baking soda together, has an intense 
15-minute high that is said to be greater than anything else a person can 
experience. Those who have experienced a crack high come crashing down into a 
deep depression that makes them crave the high more. This continues in a cycle 
that eventually leads to total dependence on the drug, and the addict will do 
anything to obtain the next high. 
</P>
<P>
My brother had spent $30,000 in a matter of months. He had lost his house and 
his job of 12 years. He had attacked members of my family and neglected his 
three children. He had begun to write bad checks and even to shoplift. 
</P>
<P>
The cops had picked him up a couple of times, but my mother always went and got 
him out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
In her call to me, my mother pleaded with me to do something. I told her to 
have him call me, and I would see if there was anything I could do. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, I didn't hear anything. Then one day I got a call from him. He 
told me that he needed help but realized he could never get it where he was. He 
asked me if I would fly him to California, where he said he would check into a 
program. I said I would, but he must get help. 
</P>
<P>
I was apprehensive about him coming and was even relieved when he missed the 
plane the first day. I expected him to be different from the person I 
remembered, but it was not until he moved in that I realized how bad the 
situation was. 
</P>
<P>
Before my brother started doing drugs he appeared invincible. He was impervious 
to pain and would never let anything or anyone control him. He was a great 
athlete who often bragged about his physique. He seemed to have a knack for 
getting back up after a fall. He was also arrogant and obnoxious. He treated 
other people as if they were his intellectual inferiors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he used every form of deceit and manipulation to get me to do things his 
way. He cried the first time we talked about his checking into a detoxification 
program because, he said, he didn't want to be locked up. When I softened my 
stand, he stopped crying. 
</P>
<P>
He threatened to beat me when I insisted he check into some kind of program, 
when all he really wanted to do was take a vacation in California. He 
threatened to walk out of the house and live on the streets if I didn't comply 
with his wishes. It wasn't until I told him he would have to go back to Texas 
that he decided to check into a program. 
</P>
<P>
He checked into an outpatient program and we participated in discussions 
together. He hated the studying they made him do. He hated the discussion 
groups. He hated the counselors. He told them that they didn't know anything 
about him and he wasn't about to tell them anything. 
</P>
<P>
For three months, I attended meetings every Tuesday and Thursday to help my 
brother with his problem. After two months, my brother stopped attending the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He went back to Texas. He said that the programs didn't work for him and he had 
to do this his way. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, my brother was back in Los Angeles. He was sleeping on a 
sidewalk three blocks from where I work downtown. Some days, he would walk into 
the lobby and have the security guard call me. I was always amazed that they 
didn't just kick him out. He often carried a water bottle and a rag in his 
pocket to wash the windows of parked or stopped cars. 
</P>
<P>
He had asked me again if he could stay with me. I told him no. I said that the 
only way that I could survive his addiction was to not be involved in it. I 
told him that if he had decided to do things his way, he would have to do it 
without my assistance. 
</P>
<P>
I put my brother out on that street corner for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
People ask me when I relate this story how he had fallen so far and how I could 
have let him sleep on the street. 
</P>
<P>
A word I learned at the counseling sessions was co-dependent. For years, I 
thrived on helping members of my family solve their problems. At 26, I have 
high blood pressure and the beginnings of an ulcer. By this time in my life I 
realized that I am just as sick as my brother, and the only way to help him was 
to take care of my illness. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing to take my brother in was the toughest decision I have ever had to 
make. But it was the best decision for me. 
</P>
<P>
One of my worst moments was walking into my apartment complex and seeing my 
brother waiting for me by the pool. He had lost considerable weight. He was 
dirty and hungry and his clothes were so ragged they were practically falling 
off him. 
</P>
<P>
At times like that, I wanted to protect him from all the hurts in the world. 
But I couldn't. All I could do was give him a hot meal and some clean clothes 
and let him take a shower. Then I sent him on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing him on the street never got any easier. I remember walking down Spring 
Street near my work one day and seeing a man coming toward me with a sign that 
said, "I will work for food." It took me a minute to realize that it was my 
brother. He had been using the sign in front of a restaurant -- not really to 
find work but to get money. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he would call me to come and bring some food. I would walk down to 
San Pedro Street and there he would be, with all of his possessions in a bag 
and his blanket spread out on the sidewalk. The gravity of his situation hit me 
one day when I saw him walking down the street talking to himself. 
</P>
<P>
While I was discussing this with a friend one day, the friend asked: "What is 
the worst thing that could happen to your brother?" I answered that he could 
die. My friend pointed out to me that if he died it would be his choice, a 
choice I would have to let him make. 
</P>
<P>
I have learned that my brother is not my responsibility. He made his choices in 
life and now he would have to suffer the consequences. By being left to deal 
with the consequences of his mistakes, he would learn that he was responsible 
for his problem. At the same time, I learned that I was responsible for me. 
</P>
<P>
My brother called me two weeks ago. He was in Kansas City, Kansas. He was 
snowed in and couldn't head out to Utah until the next day. 
</P>
<P>
He's a truck driver now and is sober, from what I can tell. He told me how much 
he loved me and how much he appreciated what I had done for him. 
</P>
<P>
"You really taught me what tough love is," he said, "and I will never forget 
that." 
</P>
<P>
And that is the key to overcoming dependencies: loving someone enough to let 
them live their lives the way they want, letting them have the fruit of their 
decisions -- good and bad. 
</P>
<P>
People will ask if I care about my brother. Of course I do. But do I worry 
about whether he is staying sober? No. 
</P>
<P>
Letting go has allowed me to love my brother more deeply. It allows me to enjoy 
the times that I talk to him now, because I can actually believe that he loves 
me. Through all the anger, pain and guilt, he came back to me to say, "I'll 
always love you for what you did."

EVIDENCE MOUNTS OF SERIOUS DAMAGE AND EARLY AGING OF CHILDREN'S LUNGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the terms of the ambitious air quality plan in store for Southern 
California, pollution is supposed to vanish by the time today's newborns enter 
college. 
</P>
<P>
The painful question is whether clear skies will come too late for children 
already familiar with smog alerts. 
</P>
<P>
While it's recognized that children, because of their physiology, are at 
greater risk than adults from breathing noxious air, the outlook for their 
long-term health risks has been as hazy as a smoggy day. 
</P>
<P>
But evidence is mounting that young people reared in heavily polluted areas 
unknowingly bear a common signature in prematurely aged lungs and a reduced 
tolerance for respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
* According to short-term studies, children living in regions with poor air 
quality have decreased lung capacity compared with youths raised in cleaner 
cities. Studies also show children suffer more respiratory infections and 
asthma attacks from exposure to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
* And, in one of the first studies examining the lifetime impact of growing up 
under brown skies, researchers have found lung tissue damage in seemingly 
healthy Los Angeles youths, an ominous finding that experts say demands further 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
The youths "were running out of lung," said Dr. Russell P. Sherwin, a USC 
pathologist who performed autopsies on 100 youths, all victims of accidents or 
homicides. The lung damage was far greater than what pathologists would expect 
to find, even among youngsters who smoke cigarettes, said Sherwin. He reported 
his study last month at the Specialty Conference on Tropospheric Ozone and the 
Environment held in the City of Industry. "Some of them definitely must be 
smokers. But the damage I'm seeing is above and beyond what we've seen with 
smoking. It's above and beyond what we've seen with (respiratory) viruses." 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator for the youths, Sherwin said, was air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
According to experts, such emerging research highlights the need for 
reappraising how to minimize children's risk of lung damage, short of fleeing 
the South Coast Air Basin. The research might even spur stricter air quality 
laws, so long talked about but so difficult to enact. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, children are very good monitors in knowing that there is a 
danger in the environment for all of us," said Dr. Richard Jackson, a 
Berkeley-based researcher on environment and children's health. "There is 
something causing direct damage in the lungs, the people most likely to show it 
are kids." 
</P>
<P>
"The more we know about children, the cleaner we're going to make our 
environment," said Bob Phalen, a professor of community and environmental 
medicine at the UC Irvine. "There is a soft spot for children. And it's 
necessary that we have a soft spot for children because children tend to not 
complain. They don't speak up and they don't get checked out." 
</P>
<P>
Most children begin life with a healthy set of lungs. But youngsters also have 
physical traits that allow lung damage to accumulate faster than in any other 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Children consume more oxygen than adults to maintain body warmth, Phalen said. 
An infant, for instance, breathes three times as much air per pound of body 
weight as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
"Right there, whatever is in the air, they're getting three times more 
pollutant per pound of body weight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Children are also more likely to breathe faster and through their mouths, 
especially while playing. Breathing through the nose filters out as much as 90% 
of some pollutants before they reach the lung. 
</P>
<P>
And children, especially those under 10, are more sensitive to damage because 
their lungs are still developing. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that children are receiving concentrated doses of pollutants that 
they are less equipped to handle, Phalen said. Computer models show that 
children can receive three to four times as many pollution deposits as adults, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actual studies on children have also linked air pollution to short-term health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Children breathing high levels of air pollution, for example, have more 
respiratory tract infections, such as colds and croup, than those who breathe 
clean air, experts said. Asthma is also known to worsen from exposure to 
pollution. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, asthma among 
6- to 11-year-olds jumped 58% in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the ingredients of air pollution diminish the lungs' ability to fight 
off infection," Phalen said. "I think the scientific community is very 
convinced that air pollution is increasing the susceptibility to respiratory 
infection. Respiratory infection is already a problem, and anything that 
increases that susceptibility should be looked at very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Lung function tests suggest that children might be suffering from exposure to 
pollutants long before the damage is obvious. Lung function is measured by 
determining the intake of air and how fast it's exhaled. 
</P>
<P>
According to a USC study, second-grade children raised in the South Coast Air 
Basin suffered a 10% to 15% loss in lung function compared with Houston 
children. The study was performed in 1984 and again three years later. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at some of these children again in 1987 and we saw the same degree 
of reduction," said Dr. Kaye Kilburn, the USC professor of medicine who 
directed the study. "They fulfilled the prediction: They did not improve their 
function as fifth-graders." 
</P>
<P>
A 10% to 15% decrease wouldn't produce any outward signs of trouble but might 
subtly erode athletic performance, said Kilburn. The difference between Houston 
and Los Angeles children remained consistent even among children exposed to 
their parents' cigarette smoke, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many of studies do not take into account other factors that might affect 
lung function, such as smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, poor hygiene, 
poor nutrition, polluted indoor air and exposure to chemicals and other toxic 
substances, Sherwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the studies fail to answer major questions about the future of 
children growing up in one of the worst regions of air pollution in the world: 
</P>
<P>
* What is actually happening to cells in the lung? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the damage permanent? 
</P>
<P>
* What illnesses or diseases could emerge from this damage? 
</P>
<P>
"A great deal is known about the respiratory system of children," Phalen said. 
"A great deal is known about their susceptibility to respiratory tract disease. 
There is knowledge about what happens to children in severe episodes of 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"What is not known is whether the day-to-day levels of the smog that we have in 
Southern California are putting children at greater risk than adults. There is 
strong circumstantial evidence for that, however." 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin's study of autopsies is the first to show precursors of lung disease 
among youths living in a polluted environment. 
</P>
<P>
The study revealed that 80% of the youths had "notable" lung abnormalities and 
27% had severe lesions. The lesions were found in a region of the lung known to 
be vulnerable to noxious substances. 
</P>
<P>
A crucial phase of the study has not been completed, however. It will determine 
what other factors might have contributed to the lung damage, such as whether 
the youths, ages 15 to 25, smoked. 
</P>
<P>
"No single agent can be implicated as the sole cause of this lesion," Sherwin 
said. "But the bottom line for me is even if I consider that the most of these 
people are smokers, I'm seeing much more damage than I would expect to see. 
It's much more severe, much more prevalent. And these are pretty young people." 
</P>
<P>
The study is one of the few attempting to address the possible consequences of 
a lifetime of exposure to air pollution, said John R. Holmes, director of 
research at the California Air Resources Board, which sponsored the study. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways to do that is to look at the lungs of younger people who have 
been exposed to smog but haven't yet begun to show any physical manifestation 
of damage," he said. "The lung has immense reserve capacity. You can sustain 
large amounts of damage but you don't realize damage has occurred." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sherwin, the youths with lung lesions were at high risk of 
developing emphysema or other lung diseases, even though they apparently had no 
symptoms of disease. 
</P>
<P>
If the youths had lived, Sherwin said, "I would say they would have a very high 
probability of clinical disease within 15 to 20 years -- by the time they get 
to be 40." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that studies such as Sherwin's must be expanded to measure the 
cumulative effects of air pollution on children growing up in different parts 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether (damage) is permanent or not. We think it probably is," 
Kilburn said of his study on lung function. "The ideal evidence would be to 
play musical chairs and move people in and out of the area. But it's hard to 
fund a study like that." 
</P>
<P>
The research on children should also address the adequacy of guidelines 
designed to minimize children's risks, Phalen said. 
</P>
<P>
According to South Coast Air Quality Management District officials, vigorous 
exercise should be replaced by such activities as golf, horseback riding, 
swings, or shooting baskets during Stage 1 alerts and by walking and crafts 
during Stage 2 alerts. Last year, Southern Californians experienced 54 Stage 1 
days and no Stage 2 days. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Phalen, those guidelines should be tailored to individuals. 
He said he recently consulted with physicians and environmental experts after 
he was asked to issue guidelines to school nurses for smog-alert days. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we recommend -- really it was a consensus -- was that on 
smog-alert days children should be allowed outdoors because indoor pollutants 
are often worse," he said. "But under no circumstances should they be forced to 
exercise. Children are often in circumstances where they are forced to 
exercise. That alarms me because our natural defenses include shutting down our 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
When exposed to heavily polluted air, many people unconsciously secrete extra 
mucus, breathe through the nose, slow down and breathe less air, Phalen said. 
The bronchial tubes constrict and become narrower. 
</P>
<P>
"These effects warn susceptible people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But individual reactions vary and children who wish to play and exercise should 
be allowed to do so, Phalen said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the facts about air pollution -- that every study has found -- is that 
the individual differences are quite large. Some people don't seem to be 
affected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can also contribute to their children's protection by becoming more 
aware of the hazards of indoor air pollution, said Dr. Spencer Koerner, an 
American Lung Assn. volunteer spokesman and director of pulmonary medicine at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the one thing parents should do is stop smoking," Koerner said. "Even 
here in California, we're inside much of the time. I think that kind of 
exposure is important." 
</P>
<P>
And, Phalen said, well-meaning parents often obtain antibiotics for their 
children's respiratory infections, but antibiotics might only prolong 
youngsters' problems in regions with poor air quality. 
</P>
<P>
"The child can get into a cycle of infections, and we tend to treat them with 
antibiotics," he said. "But what happens is microorganisms repopulate as soon 
as you stop taking the antibiotics. So you get sick again. That's called the 
rebound effect. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best things parents can do is try to minimize antibiotics use in 
their children. Parents should tell their pediatrician: 'If you don't think my 
child needs it, I don't want my child to have antibiotics.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Pollution Damages Lungs 
</P>
<P>
Autopsies of seemingly healthy youths who died in accidents or were murdered 
revealed lung damage in the form of lesions in the bronchioles. Such lesions 
have been associated with several noxious substances, including those found in 
polluted air. 
</P>
<P>
The bronchioles are small tubes that lead to tiny air sacs in the lung. They 
link the major bronchial tubes with those sacs, which are called alveoli.

CRITIC AT LARGE: WAYNE IN 3-D: ANOTHER DIMENSION TO A DISTINGUISHED FILM 
CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
REVIVAL: MICHAEL WAYNE, SON OF THE DUKE, WANTS TO BRING 'HONDO,' HIS DAD'S 1953 
WESTERN, BACK FOR A TV SCREENING, USING A 3-D PROCESS CALLED NATURAL VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Wayne died in 1979 after a battle with cancer that had begun 16 years 
earlier. But the movies offer their own version of immortality and the Duke 
continues to find viewers and admirers. In a recent poll on admired Americans 
conducted by the satiric Spy magazine, Wayne was one of the high finishers. 
</P>
<P>
The chief keeper of the Duke Wayne flame is his 55-year-old son Michael, who is 
the eldest of Wayne's seven children and who runs Batjac, the production 
company that made many of Wayne's later films. 
</P>
<P>
If present plans mature, Michael Wayne said a few days ago, "Hondo," his 
father's 1953 Western, would be seen on television this fall in the 3-D form in 
which it was originally shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood was very excited about 3-D in those days," Wayne says. Nearly 100 
films were made in 3-D, in fact, including Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for 
Murder," and the hope was that the novelty would combat the onrushing 
competition from television. "But the glasses were a problem," Wayne adds, "and 
'Hondo' was shown in 3-D only in Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Even so, it earned back its negative cost in three weeks. It was Geraldine 
Page's first film, and it won her her first Academy Award nomination." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, presently in negotiation, would be to present the film on a special 
syndication network, using a 3-D process called Natural Vision, which Wayne 
thinks is the most effective yet. The process still involves glasses, which 
might be distributed as a tie-in by one or more retailers. The film has had 
only two theatrical releases and one cable run in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Hondo" is one of four Wayne films Batjac owns outright. The others are "Island 
in the Sky" (1953) and "The High and the Mighty" (1954), both directed by 
William Wellman, and "McClintock" (1963), directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called right of publicity law enacted by California and several 
other states, the name and image of a celebrity are owned by the celebrity and 
can't be used or exploited without permission. Technically, the Wayne image was 
purchased from him by a limited partnership of his children. 
</P>
<P>
The law protects the celebrity from demeaning exploitations but it can also be 
a source of revenue. "I try to maximize the earnings from the films of my 
father that we own and those we share the ownership of," Michael Wayne says. He 
also oversees the licensing of his father's name and image on behalf of the 
family, and one of the uses of the money is to support the John Wayne Cancer 
Clinic at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was one of the most loyal USC alumni of all time. When cancer hit 
him the second time and his doctor in Newport Beach told him the best place for 
him to be was UCLA, he said, 'What! I can't set foot in that place!' But he did 
and he very quickly came to love it and to admire Dr. Donald Morton, who ran 
and still runs the cancer clinic." 
</P>
<P>
Still Wayne, an undergraduate footballer when he was still Marion (Duke) 
Morrison, preserved his loyalty to USC. "I stopped in at the hospital every 
morning on my way to the office," Michael says. "One day he called me at home 
and said it was important I bring him a USC cap. The doctors had given him a 
UCLA cap but he said, 'I just can't wear it next to my head.' I found him a USC 
cap and he put it on underneath the UCLA hat. And then he went down the 
corridor in his wheelchair, tipping his UCLA cap right and left and showing off 
the SC cap below it." 
</P>
<P>
It was a cheerful silliness in a time when not much else in Wayne's life was. 
"He fell in love with the place," Michael says. "He knew his chances of getting 
out weren't so hot, but he vowed that if he did, he was going to do a special 
about the place, do something to help them because they'd been so good to him." 
</P>
<P>
Two years after his death, the UCLA Medical School's Division of Surgical 
Oncology became the John Wayne Cancer Clinic. The clinic does a great deal of 
basic research, notably into techniques for the early detection of cancer from 
substances in the blood and urine, and in the development of immunotherapy, 
which triggers the body's own immune system to fight the cancer. The clinic 
will see more than 1,600 new patients this year. 
</P>
<P>
The John Wayne Clinic's Auxiliary, the support group now eight years old, holds 
a major annual fund-raiser, the Odyssey Ball. The 1990 event takes place 
Saturday night at the Santa Monica Airport Center. It will honor actor Carroll 
O'Connor and his wife Nancy, longtime supporters of the clinic. They will 
receive what has been named the Duke Award. 
</P>
<P>
Michael himself attended Loyola (now Loyola Marymount) University here, did a 
hitch in the Air Force, acted briefly (his brothers Patrick and Ethan are the 
working actors in the family), then turned to production. He worked at Revue as 
an assistant director before joining his father at Batjac, producing 
"McClintock," among several other films. 
</P>
<P>
One measure of John Wayne's continuing popularity has been the success of 
several big-ticket collectibles the family has licensed (revenues going to the 
clinic): bronzes, prints, a Winchester rifle of which 50,000 were sold at $600 
each. 
</P>
<P>
And recently there was what qualifies as an ultimate accolade, a postage stamp, 
one of four celebrating the Oscars, and showing Wayne as the Ringo Kid in 
"Stagecoach." (The others were Gary Cooper in "Beau Geste," Judy Garland in 
"The Wizard of Oz" and Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
"There's some Nobel Prize level work going on at the clinic," Michael Wayne 
says. "As a family we're proud to be associated with it, and I think we've done 
right by the Duke."

BOMB THREAT SNARLS COMMUTE IN VAN NUYS 
</P>

Several buildings were evacuated and a major Van Nuys intersection was closed 
this morning after a bomb threat, apparently directed at a church, was 
telephoned to police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the caller claimed that a bomb was in a brown Datsun parked near 
the Church on the Way, 14300 Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby buildings were evacuated about 9 a.m. and Sherman Way was closed between 
Van Nuys Boulevard and Hazeltine Avenue. The evacuated area included the 
Sherman Way and Lennox Avenue intersection where the church is situated. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad members and the Criminal Conspiracy 
Unit were called to the scene after a car matching the description was found 
parked near the church. Spray-painted on the sides of the car were the words 
"Hot" and "The End." On the trunk of the car was painted, "LAPD Capt. VVAL 
only," possibly a reference to an officer who is a member of the church, 
Detective Bob Muldrew said. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb-sniffing dogs were used to approach the car but gave no indication of an 
explosive device inside. Later, bomb experts detonated small charges inside the 
car, but no larger explosion was triggered. The car was searched and no 
explosives were found, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb threat caused severe traffic congestion in the largely commercial area 
near Sherman Way and Van Nuys Boulevard, two heavily traveled roads during the 
morning commute, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Church on the Way, which espouses charismatic beliefs, 
declined to comment on the incident. Muldrew said the motive for the threat was 
not known.

LOCKHEED BUILT 59 OF THEM -- U.S.

The Pentagon, releasing long-classified figures for its super-secret F-117A 
Stealth fighter jet program, said today that it cost $6.26 billion to develop 
and build the dark, delta-winged aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was used in combat as a "giant stun grenade" during the Panama 
invasion, cost $106.2 million each, the Defense Department said. 
</P>
<P>
By making Stealth information public, Pentagon officials hope to increase 
support for the military's so-called "black budget" programs, those that are 
kept tightly held secrets by military and congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Many in Congress expressed "sticker shock" when the high-cost figures of 
$530-million-per-plane for the B-2 Stealth bomber were released last year. In 
light of that, pressure has built for the release of information about other 
highly classified programs. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams disclosed for the first time that three of the 
59 planes that were ordered have crashed. Only two more are still under 
construction, leaving 54 jets currently operational. 
</P>
<P>
Williams declined, however, to say why the three crashed or to disclose the 
jet's speed, range, weapons payload, or just how much of the aircraft can be 
seen on radar. Nor would he say whether the plane is capable of carrying 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did, however, describe the jet as being in the "high subsonic 
range." He refused to say whether the jet could carry air-to-air weaponry but 
he did say it carries "the full range of tactical fighter ordnance" and is 
capable of "defending itself." 
</P>
<P>
The single-pilot, dual-engine plane weighs 52,500 pounds. Its wingspan is just 
a little over 43 feet. It is just over 65 feet long, and 12 feet, 5 inches 
high, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
The packet distributed to reporters today included a series of photographs of 
the plane. It has stark, angular facets in contrast to the smoother, bat-winged 
form of the controversial and costly B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said the plane's mission "is to attack high-priority targets 
anywhere in the world. The F-117A is designed to penetrate dense-threat 
environments and hit targets with pinpoint accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
The statement also disclosed that there are about 2,650 military men and women 
assigned to support the planes. "Most live within the greater Las Vegas 
community" and commute to and from the Tonopah Test Range, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plane reportedly has been operational since 1983, the Pentagon 
refused to even acknowledge that it existed until November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, only one photograph of the jet was released. Aviation experts 
contended that the picture was carefully selected to conceal the real 
dimensions of the plane's radical, swept-back form. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force used the super-secret plane in combat for the first time during 
the invasion of Panama last Dec. 20, using the aircraft to drop 2,000-pound 
bombs on a field outside the barracks where Panamanian troops were housed. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Williams said the fighter-bomber was used to "disorient, 
stun and confuse" the Panamanian troops so they could not react to the U.S. 
paratroopers dropping nearby.

The prosecutor in the racketeering trial of former Philippines First Lady 
Imelda Marcos said today the former beauty queen plundered her country and used 
its main bank as a "personal piggy bank." 
</P>
<P>
In opening statements in the trial, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Livingston said the case involves $140 million of stolen money illegally 
brought to the United States to buy four Manhattan buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of theft, fraud and deceit on an incredible scale," Livingston 
told a packed U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said Marcos, whose late husband, Ferdinand, ruled the Philippines 
before being ousted in a popular revolution, used the New York branch of the 
Philippine National Bank as "her own personal piggy bank. She cracked it open 
and had bundles of cash delivered to her so that she could buy artworks and 
jewels." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, dressed in black, clutched a rosary to her bosom and at times looked 
near tears as the prosecutor outlined the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi also is charged in the case.

JUDGE SEQUESTERS POINDEXTER JURY;

<P>
2 JURORS CONTACTED BY REPORTERS, NEARLY CAUSING MISTRIAL

The judge presiding over the Iran-Contra trial of John M. Poindexter today 
ordered the jury sequestered after two members of the panel were contacted by 
the press, nearly causing a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
At a hastily called hearing, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene angrily 
announced that two jurors had been contacted Monday night by women identifying 
themselves as reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said the attempts to contact jurors, who began deliberating Monday, might be 
considered an obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll think about that," Greene said. "This almost created a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided I will sequester the jury. I have tried to avoid that," Greene 
said. "I'm very sorry to have to do this, but the irresponsible behavior of the 
press leaves me no choice." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I certainly don't want to have a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
The reporter, identified in court as Nora Boustany, is a prize-winning foreign 
correspondent for the Washington Post. In the courtroom, the juror who was 
contacted said when Boustany called, he hung up on her only to be called by her 
a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kaiser, the newspaper's assistant managing editor for national news, said 
that Boustany has reported from Lebanon for many years and that she never lived 
or worked in the United States until recently. She was assigned to find out how 
to contact the Poindexter juror after the trial, Kaiser said, and made the 
mistake of contacting him directly. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us what happened, and we called the judge's chambers and apologized," 
Kaiser said. "No substantive questions were asked or answered." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser said, "We're virtually certain" the second juror was not contacted by 
anyone from his newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the woman who called the second juror and said she was a 
reporter is not known. The juror hung up before getting the caller's name. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said Boustany's excuse of not knowing "the ground rules" was "a lame 
excuse" and one that would be ridiculed by the press if made by a government 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of eight women and four men will move into a hotel, Greene said. Today 
was the panel's first full day of deliberations after receiving instructions 
from Greene on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, 53, the last of the original Iran-Contra defendants, is the highest 
Reagan Administration official to stand trial in the Iran-Contra scandal. The 
retired Navy rear admiral is accused of obstruction of Congress, conspiracy and 
the destruction of official government documents.

Parliament elected reformist Communist Petar Mladenov as president of a new, 
non-socialist republic today and cleared the way for free multi-party elections 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, who ousted disgraced hard-line state and Communist Party leader Todor 
Zhivkov last November, said he will resign from the party's decision-making 
Supreme Council to steer the Balkan state toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian Communist Party wants guarantees for a peaceful transition to 
democracy and also wants a man . . . who can provide those guarantees," 
Mladenov told reporters before the Communist-dominated National Assembly 
unanimously elected him. 
</P>
<P>
His swearing-in was the chamber's last act before it dissolved for elections 
June 10 and 17 that will usher in Bulgaria's first freely elected Parliament in 
45 years. 
</P>
<P>
The outgoing chamber also gave final approval to two laws on the formation of 
political parties and electoral procedures and amended the existing 
constitution to make Bulgaria a "democratic" rather than a "socialist" state.

Suspected Nazi war criminal Joseph Schwammberger, wanted for killing and 
deporting thousands of Jews during World War II, will be extradited from 
Argentina next month, the Justice Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Bonn and Buenos Aires to bring back the 78-year-old 
Schwammberger to face trial climaxes 17 years of delicate diplomatic 
negotiations since the two countries do not have an extradition agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Schwammberger case shows that no one under suspicion of Nazi crimes can be 
certain of escaping justice . . . wherever in the world he may hide," said West 
German Justice Minister Hans Engelhard in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Schwammberger, arrested by Argentine police in 1987, will be handed over to 
West German officials May 2. He is accused of killing up to 1,000 people -- 
some of them personally.

Forbes magazine fired a volley across the bow of competitor Fortune today with 
a new list of the 50 most powerful U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Super 50," the Forbes list ranks the biggest companies in America 
based on their "across-the-board strength" in sales, profits, assets and the 
market value of their stock. 
</P>
<P>
The new Forbes list was introduced on the same day as the venerable Fortune 500 
list in a thinly veiled attempt to steal some of Fortune's traditional thunder. 
</P>
<P>
A press release from Forbes describing the new Super 50 labeled the Fortune 
list, which is limited to industrial companies ranked by sales, as 
"one-dimensional." 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. topped the Super 50, placing first among all U.S. 
companies in both sales and profits. GM also topped the Fortune 500. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric wes ranked second by Forbes, followed by Exxon, IBM, Ford 
Motor Co. and Philip Morris. Rounding out the top 10 were AT&amp;T, Mobil, Du 
Pont and Sears.

Teamsters at McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Southern California plants ratified a

The contract, covering 250 Teamsters from Local 692, was approved by a vote of 
156 to 7. The Teamsters International had sanctioned a strike to occur as early 
as today. 
</P>
<P>
Local 692 represents truck drivers, chauffeurs and railroad freight handlers 
whose wages have averaged about $15 an hour. Members carry and unload parts and 
major aerospace components to the corporation's Douglas Aircraft Co. facilities 
in Long Beach, Torrance and Carson, and McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas spokesman Don Hanson said the pact is similar to a contract the company 
signed in December with its machinists union. That contract provides a 5 1/2% 
pay raise in the first year and 3% increases in each of the second and third 
years. It also provides for a 4% annual lump-sum bonus for each worker, based 
on the worker's total yearly wage.

Federal investigators who uncovered 7,000 child labor violations during a 
three-day sweep last month found an additional 4,000 infractions in a review of 
case files, the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Civil fines on the businesses involved are expected to total $2.9 million, up 
from the $1.8 million originally predicted following the March 12-15 sweep, 
said William Brooks, an assistant secretary of labor. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the violations involved teen-agers working more hours or later hours 
during the school week than is allowed under federal law, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
But there were also 1,450 youngsters age 14-17 who were illegally employed in 
dangerous jobs, such as using power-driven meat-slicing machinery, dough mixers 
and paper balers, the department said.

Boeing Co. is investigating what apparently is a case of industrial sabotage, 
after a jetliner failed tests because of wires that had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly seems to have been deliberate," T. Craig Martin, Boeing Commercial 
Airplane Group spokesman, said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence at this point would suggest it would be an employee but we want 
to find out for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's security personnel are investigating, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 was in final assembly and undergoing testing at a Renton plant 
when the cut wires were discovered, Martin said. It had not been determined in 
what stage of construction the wires were cut, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The damage was found about two weeks ago, KIRO-TV reported. "Scores" of wires 
were severed, the TV station reported. It said there was a pattern of one or 
two wires cut in a bundle of wires and the broken ends hidden deep inside the 
bundle to mask the damage.

PETER O'TOOLE'S WONDERFUL TALES ABOUT 'LOITERING' MAY YET END UP IN A BOOK

<P>
Peter O'Toole once planned to be a newspaperman. On the positive side, he's 
been puttering around with what old-school newspapermen always claim they're 
puttering around with: a book. 
</P>
<P>
The title of O'Toole's tome? 
</P>
<P>
"Loitering With Intent," the actor said. He would have much to write about. He 
has loitered and taken the waters with hearty companions such as Richard 
Burton, Richard Harris and John Huston, and he tells wonderful tales about all. 
</P>
<P>
Has he set himself a deadline for the book? O'Toole, who no longer takes the 
waters, shook his head. "Not a deadline, a start line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was a bit weary when interviewed. He'd risen at dawn in London and zipped 
across the Atlantic via Concorde jet to help drumbeat for "Crossing To 
Freedom," a two-hour CBS film. He left the next day for a film in Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
In the CBS movie, airing Sunday, he plays a sad, grumpy old Englishman who 
reluctantly shepherds seven children to safety early in World War II when 
Hitler's armies invade France. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving here to tout the film, O'Toole taped an interview for "CBS This 
Morning." Then he was shepherded to the United Nations, where the United 
Nations Children's International Fund hailed the movie and served him lunch. 
</P>
<P>
O'Toole, still so gaunt he'd be marked absent if he turned sideways, was 
good-natured and gracious about it all. Like many who began on the British 
stage, he realizes publicity is part of the actor's territory. 
</P>
<P>
But he isn't sure why he became an actor. His first desire was to fight Hitler. 
That would have been difficult, though; he was only 8 when the war began. So he 
did the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, he went to work at a newspaper in Yorkshire, England, where he'd grown 
up after his family left Ireland. "I did love it -- we shot out four editions a 
day," he says of his days as an ink-stained wretch. 
</P>
<P>
"But something happened, I don't know what, and I joined the Navy," he says. He 
served on a submarine, and later a corvette, the latter the small, 
always-rolling ship about which Nicholas Monsarrat wrote in "The Cruel Sea." 
</P>
<P>
That isn't the usual preparation for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. But 
after leaving the service, he attended that distinguished school, where he 
began learning his actor's craft, Shakespeare and all that. 
</P>
<P>
In time, he also learned of the slings and arrows of outrageous critics. How 
does he regard critics now? He smiles. "I disregard them. When you've been 
punching along in the game as long I have . . . you find they go away and die."

The heirs of three of France's best-known 20th-Century authors and 55 other 
writers threatened today to switch publishers if a corporate raider succeeded 
in gaining control of the Gallimard publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
The heirs and copyright holders of Nobel laureates Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert 
Camus and Andre Gide made the threat in a statement also signed by Paris-based 
Czechoslovak author Milan Kundera and best-selling novelist Marguerite Duras. 
</P>
<P>
"If a financial or industrial group succeeds in gaining control of Gallimard, 
thus jeopardizing its independence, we would immediately withdraw" from 
Gallimard's list, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Publishing sources said the authors were likely to find it extremely difficult 
to pull out if Gallimard changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
French media said construction group Bouygues had expressed interest in buying 
shares in France's largest independent publisher since a bitter ownership feud 
among four Gallimard children broke out in January. 
</P>
<P>
Gallimard's highbrow list makes it the most sought-after jewel in French 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a French court effectively blocked attempts by the publishing 
house's chief executive, Antoine Gallimard, to create a new holding company to 
protect the group against any outside raiders.

Aldo Fabrizi, the Italian actor who sprang to international fame as the 
courageous priest executed by Nazis in Roberto Rossellini's classic film "Rome, 
Open City," died Monday at 84. 
</P>
<P>
Fabrizi, whose death was announced by his family, had been suffering from heart 
problems for the past year. A native Roman from a poor family, Fabrizi never 
lost his common touch. One of Italy's most popular actors, he began his career 
in the theater in 1931 and made his first film 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945 Rossellini chose the rotund Fabrizi to play Don Pietro, a Roman priest 
who defied the Fascists during the German occupation of the capital and was 
tortured and executed because he would not betray partisans.

SCHWARZENEGGER 'LIKE A FATHER' TO HIS NEPHEW

SCHWARZENEGGER 'RAISING' A NEPHEW: It's a script right out of Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's hit movie "Twins." Only this is real life. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the pumping iron actor has quietly been helping to raise his 
late brother's illegitimate son and has now provided him with a job and shelter 
in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a father to him," claims Wendy Leigh, author of the new unauthorized 
biography "Arnold." 
</P>
<P>
In "Twins," Schwarzenegger tracks down a long-lost brother and helps him. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Schwarzenegger is doing the same thing for Patrick Knapp, who was fathered 
by Arnold's brother, Meinhard, in 1968 in Munich, West Germany, writes Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers had not talked in years. Arnold even refused to attend 
Meinhard's funeral in 1971. But he later wrote to Patrick's mother, Erika 
Knapp, and offered help. Eventually, Erika asked for assistance, and Arnold 
provided it in the way of cash and tuition payments for Patrick's schooling. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, Patrick finally paid his uncle a visit in California and 
ended up staying, writes Leigh. He was even in Arnold and Maria Shriver's 
wedding on April 26, 1986. Today, he lives in a house owned by his uncle in 
Venice and trains in a nearby World Gym outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh says that as kids the Schwarzenegger brothers were often pitted against 
each other by their domineering father, Gustav, an Austrian policeman who 
joined the Nazi party on July 4, 1938. According to Leigh, Gustav took 
"delight" in humiliating the loser -- which, surprisingly, was often Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
DE NIRO HELPS HONOR WILLI: It was one of those typically New York afternoon 
get-togethers with everyone eyeing everyone else and the "dahlings" and 
"how-are-yous" flowing like diet soda. 
</P>
<P>
Toukie Smith had scored a coup of sorts by persuading her steady beau, the 
usually reticent Robert De Niro, to come out for a benefit fashion show Sunday 
afternoon on Willi Smith Day 1990 in honor of the designer who died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Toukie is Willi's sister, and she has dedicated part of her life toward keeping 
her brother's name alive by holding fashion shows for charity. In all, four 
local charities benefited from the event, which also introduced new young 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the celebs were Mayor David N. Dinkins, Ashford &amp; Simpson, Lou 
Diamond Phillips, clean-shaven director Martin Scorsese, Chris Walken, Gregory 
Hines and Sherry Bronfman, who split from Seagram's heir, Edgar Jr., in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Simpson and Walken took to the runway to model a few duds. There also 
was a raffle, some dancing and a buffet. And over in the corner, away from the 
crowd, was beautiful Drena De Niro spinning records as the party's DJ. Drena is 
Bobby's teen-age daughter; her mother is Dianne Abbott, De Niro's only wife. 
They're divorced. 
</P>
<P>
HERE AND THERE: Natasha Richardson, star of Cinecom's "The Handmaid's Tale," 
will be a maid no longer, come summer. She and producer Robert Fox will walk 
down the aisle in London in June. . . . Producer Fran Weissler dropped this 
tidbit the other day: Negotiations are under way for Kathleen Turner's play 
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" to eventually make it to the little screen via ABC-TV.

<P>
The judge who ordered convicted police-slapper Zsa Zsa Gabor to work at a 
women's shelter as part of her sentence wants a detailed accounting of her 
hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
"Kindly send me copies of all records kept to document her community service 
activities as to dates, times and activities performed," Beverly Hills 
Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin wrote to the director of the homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin gave Vera Davis, executive director of the Venice-area LIEU-CAP shelter 
until April 13 to document Gabor's work there. Gabor was to have completed her 
sentence by last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Davis filed a three-paragraph letter with the court Friday stating that Gabor 
completed her 120 hours of community service work but provided no detail. Last 
month, the shelter director said Gabor worked about 50 hours at the facility 
but completed the rest of her sentence through guest appearances and in 
planning a June 8 celebrity auction at her Bel-Air home to benefit the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox said the judge is trying to resolve the 
conflicting information. Substituting guest appearances and a celebrity auction 
for hands-on shelter work was unacceptable, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor has said that planning the auction had taken up "countless" hours and 
fulfilled her sentence.

Willie Nelson hopes the fourth Farm Aid concert can elicit greater support for 
the family farmer. 
</P>
<P>
The singer and fellow organizers, musicians John Cougar Mellencamp and Neil 
Young, had hoped that they had performed their final Farm Aid concert when they 
left the stage in 1988 in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the problem might have gone away by now," Nelson, the president of 
Farm Aid, said last week in a telephone interview from Montreal, where he was 
on tour. 
</P>
<P>
Farm Aid IV will be held Saturday in the Hoosier Dome before 45,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative lineup of more than 60 acts includes Guns N' Roses, Bonnie Raitt, 
Don Henley, Bruce Hornsby, Richard Marx, John Denver, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, 
Jackson Browne, Dwight Yoakum, K. T. Oslin and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The 
cable Nashville Network will carry the show from noon to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The concert sold out in less than 90 minutes, but Nelson said urban problems 
such as homelessness and unemployment dilute the concern city dwellers hold for 
the struggle of family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of apathy out there. It's a little difficult for someone living 
in a big city to get excited about what's happening on the farm," he said.

The game of golf requires a cool mind and a steady hand.

<P>
But even the keenest of golfers can sometimes raise his club in anger. 
</P>
<P>
A Swedish player recently was practicing his swing on a small airfield outside 
the southern Swedish town of Hoganas when a groundsman drove up on a tractor 
and told him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The golfer, angered by the interruption, smashed the side windows of the 
tractor with his club. 
</P>
<P>
Groundsman Allan Jonsson escaped unharmed, according to the Swedish news agency 
TT, but he reported the incident to the police, who charged the golfer -- with 
violation of aviation laws.

Jim Valvano is all but out as basketball coach at North Carolina State and all 
that remains is for the two sides to work out a financial settlement, his 
attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I read it. It appears that the option of him staying on as 
coach is no longer available," attorney Woody Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
"We now know what we need to focus on in the sense that it appears there's 
going to have to be some monetary resolution of the situation or there'll be a 
judicial resolution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State attorneys have been given permission to sue Valvano for 
breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said, however, that he disputed claims by the school's attorneys that they 
have the authority to make all decisions regarding Valvano's future. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some question now as to the authority that was bestowed on the 
attorneys by the board of trustees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Valvano might be willing to go to court to keep his job, Webb 
said they had not discussed that possibility. But he added, "He'd rather be on 
the basketball court than in court." 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he asked the school's attorney to be allowed to meet with the board 
of trustees. "They politely noted the request, but there was no indication such 
a meeting would be forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, who has coached the Wolfpack for 10 years, led North Carolina State to 
a stunning victory over heavily favored Houston in the 1983 NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, however, he and the basketball program have been the targets of 
controversy. North Carolina State was placed on two years' NCAA probation last 
fall for violations involving the sale of sneakers and tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Sources told the News and Observer of Raleigh that legal proceedings to remove 
Valvano would probably be initiated by the end of the week unless Valvano 
voluntarily agreed to step down. 
</P>
<P>
The University of North Carolina Board of Governors voted unanimously Monday to 
allow school officials to file suit against Valvano to force his resignation. 
The vote came during a two-hour closed session of the board, which oversees the 
state's 16-campus public university system. The board must authorize member 
universities to pursue legal actions. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Robert (Roddy) Jones said after the vote that he hopes the 
question of Valvano's future does not end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is not proud of anything that goes on this long within our 
16-campus system," Jones said. "And, of course, N.C. State University, the 
board of trustees and all the friends of N.C. State wish for this to come to a 
speedy conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"The next step will be up to N.C. State University's private counsel, along 
with his coordination with the attorney general's office." 
</P>
<P>
Neither N.C. State interim Chancellor Larry Monteith nor Howard Manning, an 
attorney for the school, would comment on the school's plans.

SUTCLIFFE PLAGUED BY SORE SHOULDER

<P>
Cubs' pitcher Rick Sutcliffe is being bothered by a soreness in his right 
shoulder again, threatening his job in Chicago's starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm concerned," Sutcliffe said Monday at Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing shoulder is the same condition that drained the big right-hander of 
his effectiveness during the second half of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll warm up before the game (today) and, if it's still not right, I won't 
pitch," he said. "I just don't know much about it yet. It didn't feel great the 
other day." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Combs, the rookie pitcher many think could wind up the ace of the 
Philadelphia Phillies' pitching staff this season, is nursing a tender pitching 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Combs, 4-0 after being promoted from Class AAA last September, walked around 
the clubhouse Monday with an ice pack on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody in the Phillies organization hastened to play down the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little tenderness, no problem," Manager Nick Leyva said. "He was 
scheduled to pitch tomorrow (today), but we'll let him rest." 
</P>
<P>
"He's been pushed back a little" to Thursday or Friday, Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies today cut pitchers Dickie Noles and Jose DeJesus from the spring 
training roster, sending DeJesus to the minors and leaving open the possibility 
of keeping Noles in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates have reassigned right-handed pitcher Mike York to their 
minor-league camp, leaving the opening-day limit of 27 players on their roster 
-- at least on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise agreement reached Monday between the players union and 
owners, rosters will be expanded to 27 players for the first three weeks of the 
season. The Pirates' roster seems set, except that the club is carrying only 10 
pitchers, and Manager Jim Leyland plans to go north with 12. 
</P>
<P>
Two minor-league pitchers will be added, barring a last-minute trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any difference if they have major league experience. . . . If 
they're the best guys, they're going to go with us next Monday," Leyland said. 
"We're definitely going to take 12 pitchers . . . and (backup catcher) Tom 
Prince will make the club." 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds today optioned pitchers Rosario Rodriguez and Scott Scudder 
to their Class AAA Nashville farm team. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, a left-hander, and Scudder, a right-hander, both split time last 
season between the Reds and their minor-league system. 
</P>
<P>
The transfers leave 28 roster and six non-roster players still in the Reds' 
big-league camp. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate broker representing out-of-state investors said he would not 
identify a proposed new Texas Rangers baseball stadium in west Dallas as part 
of a complex that might also feature football, basketball, horse racing and 
auto racing, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, real estate broker Don Shackelford of 
Arlington, Tex., said Prime Sports Partners Ltd. plans to build a sports 
complex on 1,017 acres just east of Loop 12 and Interstate 30. 
</P>
<P>
The site, among the highest spots in Dallas County, is about seven miles west 
of downtown Dallas; about five miles south of Texas Stadium, where the Dallas 
Cowboys play in suburban Irving, and about 10 miles east of the Rangers' home, 
Arlington Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're offering a sports complex for the Metroplex," Shackelford said Monday. 
"It's not baseball; it's not anything. It's just a sports complex." 
</P>
<P>
Rangers owners are on record as saying Arlington Stadium is inadequate.

Peter Jones, a senior sports announcer for British Broadcasting Corp.'s radio 
services, died Monday after collapsing as he called the Oxford-Cambridge Boat 
Race. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was not revealed. Newspaper reports said Jones suffered a 
stroke while covering the rowing race on the Thames on Saturday afternoon. He 
was taken to St. George's Hospital in south London after the race but did not 
regain consciousness, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was a featured correspondent on Sports Report, the BBC sports roundup 
show. His work included commentary on the Heysel Stadium riots in 1985, in 
which 35 people died, and the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium last April, in 
which 95 soccer fans were crushed to death.

KINGS LIMP INTO CALGARY, LEAVE GRETZKY BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK BRINSTER, AP SPORTS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the injured Wayne Gretzky a doubtful participant, the battered Kings open 
the NHL Smythe Division playoffs Wednesday night against the defending Stanley 
Cup champion Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, sidelined after absorbing a hard check from Alan Kerr of the New York 
Islanders on March 22, is one of six injured Kings. That's hardly encouraging 
considering the Kings' 8-4 loss to the Flames in the season finale Sunday night 
and a healthy Los Angeles team's playoff loss to Calgary last season in four 
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we do not expect to have Gretzky back in the lineup on 
Wednesday," Coach Tom Webster said Monday before the Kings -- without Gretzky 
-- left for Banff, Alberta, to prepare for the first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
"I've no idea when Wayne will return," Webster said. "We just have to take it 
day by day." 
</P>
<P>
Team officials say Gretzky, who won his eighth NHL scoring title this season, 
has spasms and a hyperextension of the back. But they haven't ruled out the 
possibility, however remote, that he may play Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne continues to be treated in Los Angeles, and remains on a day-to-day 
basis," team physician Dr. Steve Lombardo said. 
</P>
<P>
The other injured Kings are forwards John Tonelli, Dave Taylor and Steve Kasper 
and defensemen Larry Robinson and Tom Laidlaw. All missed Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"We do expect to have Robinson back, hopefully Tonelli and Kasper, too," said 
Webster, himself recovering from an inner ear operation. "But both Tom Laidlaw 
and Wayne Gretzky are big question marks." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who likened the Kerr check to being rear-ended in an auto accident, 
had 40 goals and 142 points this season. Those were the worst numbers he has 
posted since getting 137 points as a rookie in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
His absence would be a severe blow to the fourth-place Kings, whose 75 points 
this season surpassed only the Islanders' 73 among the NHL's 16 playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Gretzky is the best player in the world," Kings goaltender Mario Gosselin 
said. "With him in the lineup, it changes the way the other team plays against 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the injury, some of the Flames wonder if the questions concerning 
Gretzky might be a ploy to throw them off their game. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be," forward Theoren Fleury said. "The only guys that know are the 
Kings. We can't be worried if he's going to be playing or not. We have to focus 
on us and how well we're going to play." 
</P>
<P>
The first-place Flames, whose 99 points are second-best in the league, will 
host the first two games of the best-of-seven series. After Friday night's 
second game at the Olympic Saddledome, the series shifts to Inglewood, where 
games three and four will be played Sunday and next Tuesday. The teams would 
alternate sites for games six through seven, as needed. 
</P>
<P>
That rotation also would hold for the other Campbell Conference series. 
</P>
<P>
In the other Smythe Division series, Winnipeg opens at Edmonton, where Gretzky 
led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In the Norris Division, regular-season champion Chicago is host to Minnesota 
and Toronto visits St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Wales Conference playoffs start Thursday night, with the second game in 
each series set for Saturday. Games three and four would be Monday and next 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Bruins, whose 101 points led the league, are at home against 
Hartford to open the first round in the Adams Division. Montreal, a loser to 
Calgary in the Stanley Cup final last year, opens at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
In the Patrick Division, the Islanders open at the New York Rangers.

PADRES SIGN IMPACT PLAYER CARTER, RELIEF PITCHER CRAIG LEFFERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM DONAGHY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack McKeon came to the winter meetings shopping for a pennant and came away 
with some luxury items for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, the Padres manager and GM, acquired Joe Carter in a blockbuster trade 
with Cleveland and signed free-agent reliever Craig Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
Will it be enough to win the National League West? 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, the defending NL champs, have added Kevin Bass. The Dodgers 
signed Hubie Brooks. All Cincinnati has to do is stay healthy; the talent is 
already there. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made a rush at the Giants in the final weeks of the 1989 season by 
winning 29 of 39 but fell short by three games. McKeon expects the addition of 
Carter will make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In acquiring Carter, McKeon came away with an impact player who can carry 
teammates when they need it most. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has averaged 31 homers and 108 RBIs over the last four seasons. In 1989, 
he hit .243 with 35 homers and 105 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"He works at being a complete hitter and he's unselfish," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything went right for McKeon during the off-season, though: Cy Young 
Award winner Mark Davis, who saved 44 games in 1989, signed as a free agent 
with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of Davis, the Padres should have enough in the bullpen with 
the addition of Lefferts. The left-hander had 20 saves for the Giants last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon needs a big season from rookie pitcher Andy Benes, who joins Bruce 
Hurst, Ed Whitson, Dennis Rasmussen and Eric Show in the Padres' rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' biggest problem is the left side of the infield. Third baseman Mike 
Pagliarulo hit .196 and shortstop Garry Templeton is 34 and slowing down 
because of bad knees. 
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finished with the best team ERA in the majors last season at 2.95 
but had the lowest batting average, .240. 
</P>
<P>
To add some punch, Los Angeles signed free agent outfielder Hubie Brooks (14 
HRs, 70 RBIs for Montreal) and traded Mike Marshall and Alejandro Pena to the 
Mets for Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers toyed with the idea of moving Brooks to third base, but he will 
remain in the outfield because of the abbreviated spring training. Samuel will 
be in center, even though the former second baseman has trouble with shallow 
fly balls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest reasons the Dodgers' offense fell apart last season was the 
loss of 1988 MVP Kirk Gibson to a hamstring injury. Gibson (.213, 9 HRs, 28 
RBIs) had off-season surgery but may not be ready for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Eddie Murray got off to a slow start as he adjusted to NL 
pitching but finished with 20 homers and 88 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' measly run-production was a nightmare for the pitchers. Orel 
Hershiser had a 2.31 ERA but finished 15-15. Tim Belcher (2.82) led the league 
in shutouts but ended 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
There's more pitching on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez and John Wetteland were impressive last year and are ready to 
make big contributions. Several teams asked about Martinez over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who averaged only 3.4 runs, just need a little more offense to get 
back into contention. Brooks may be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Reds 
</P>
<P>
The Reds couldn't overcome a season dominated by Pete Rose controversies and 
lots of injuries, finishing fifth at 75-87. 
</P>
<P>
There's talent on this team -- lots of it -- and Lou Piniella has the job of 
putting it together after the sorry Rose era. 
</P>
<P>
Every starter in the Reds lineup was hurt last season except first baseman Todd 
Benzinger (17 HRs, 76 RBIs). Ironically, Benzinger broke his left hand while 
taking batting practice during the lockout March 2. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Barry Larkin (.342) missed the second half of the season when he 
sustained an arm injury during the "skills competition" at the All-Star Game. 
It was that type of year for the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Chris Sabo, the Rookie of the Year in 1988, also spent time on 
the disabled list and slumped to .260 with six homers and 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Eric Davis hit .281 with 34 homers and 101 RBIs despite missing 
several games with sore feet. The Reds also need a big season from right 
fielder Paul O'Neill to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries also decimated the pitching staff. Danny Jackson went from 23-8 in 
1988 to 6-11. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' pitching started to fall apart during the playoffs and World 
Series, and they haven't done much to improve on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Can 40-year-old Rick Reuschel repeat his 17-8 season? Scott Garrelts came out 
of the bullpen last year and finished 14-5 as a starter. The other starters 
from 1989, Mike LaCoss and Don Robison, combined to go 22-21. Mike Krukow, 
injured most of 1989, has retired. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Roger Craig is counting on a group of young pitchers to find another 
big winner. 
</P>
<P>
To help the youngsters, the Giants signed free agent catcher Gary Carter. 
Carter is coming off an injury-plagued season (knees) when he dropped to .183 
with only two homers and 15 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants also must make up for the loss of reliever Craig Lefferts, who 
signed with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark, who signed a four-year deal for $15 million, has emerged as one of 
the game's best hitters and should get some help in the infield by the presence 
of third baseman Matt Williams for a full season. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Braves 
</P>
<P>
Despite giving signs last season that they were ready to make a move, the 
Braves finished last for the third straight year with a 63-97 record. 
</P>
<P>
Reason for optimism comes from a group of young pitchers that includes Tom 
Glavine (14-8), John Smoltz (12-11), Derek Lilliquist (8-10) and Mike Stanton 
(seven saves, 1.50 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
To help provide the pitchers some runs, the Braves signed free agent first 
baseman Nick Esasky. He loved hitting in Atlanta while a member of Cincinnati 
and had 30 homers and 108 RBIs for Boston in 1989. In six seasons with the 
Reds, Esasky hit .375 with 14 homers and 36 RBIs at Atlanta-Fulton County 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Murphy got off to a horrendous start last season but finished strong with 
20 homers and 84 RBIs. The Braves need his bat for an entire season to escape 
the basement. 
</P>
<P>
Houston Astros 
</P>
<P>
The Astros needed a trade to come up with a big bat over the winter but came up 
empty. In fact, Houston's only .300 hitter, Kevin Bass, left to sign as a free 
agent with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
After first baseman Glenn Davis (34 HRs, 89 RBIs) there's a big drop in power. 
Next in home run production was catcher Craig Biggio with 13. 
</P>
<P>
Usually reliable second baseman Bill Doran had an awful second half, going 
23-for-176 (.131) after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
For the Astros to be serious contenders, they need a big year from rookie left 
fielder Eric Anthony (28 HRs, 79 RBIs at Class AA Columbus in the Southern 
League). 
</P>
<P>
The Astros can be pesky, but they don't have the bats to make it over a full 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Predicted order: 1) San Diego. 2) Cincinnati. 3) San Francisco. 4) Los Angeles. 
5) Atlanta. 6) Houston.

INDY CHAMP FITTIPALDI SHARES BILLING ON TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emerson Fittipaldi is quite happy to share top billing with two other ace 
drivers, Danny Sullivan and Rick Mears, in the "World Championship Racing 
Superteam" that is expected to dominate this season's Indy circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all No. 1 on the team," the 43-year-old Brazilian driver said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
As the reigning CART-Indy champion and winner of last year's Indianapolis 500, 
however, Fittipaldi knows that he will be the driver everyone will be trying to 
beat when the season opens Sunday in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure will be on me being the defending champion," said Fittipaldi, who 
won five races last year. "I hope I can cope with the pressure. I have had that 
kind of pressure before in Formula One." 
</P>
<P>
Before making his Indy debut in 1984, Fittipaldi raced to Formula One world 
championships in 1972 and 1974 and was runner-up in 1975. By winning the 
overall Indy title last year, Fittipaldi joined Mario Andretti as the only 
other driver to win the championship of both circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi believes that the team's policy of sharing information about the 
practice runs will benefit all three drivers. He knows, however, that once the 
starting flag drops, he will have to handle the burden of defending his crown 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be mentally prepared," Fittipaldi said. "I know that in May at 
Indianapolis, the pressure will be great. Everybody will be asking me questions 
about this and that. I can't lose my focus." 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi is aware that he will be hard-pressed to duplicate his successes of 
last season, when he became the first Indy driver to surpass $2 million in 
career prize money. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a very special year, and it will be very difficult to repeat, 
but that's my challenge," Fittipaldi said. "I have to realize that I'm just 
driver Emerson and that I cannot be thinking I'm the driver who won the world 
championship or Indy last year. That would build up the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
He is not ready to slow down yet, however, and is eager to increase his tally 
of 10 Indy circuit victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still motivated to continue here," Fittipaldi said.

A group that includes a former Bonwit Teller chief executive plans to bid $35 
million to acquire most of the department store chain, a federal bankruptcy 
court hearing was told Monday. 
</P>
<P>
William Ruben, Bonwit Teller's president and chief executive for much of the 
1980s, is among a team that intends to offer $13 million for 13 stores in the 
16-store chain and $22 million for inventory, mostly apparel. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Hirshon, an attorney for Bonwit Teller's parent company, L.J. Hooker 
Corp., said the group expected to be ready to submit its plan soon, after 
completing financing and other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The investment group also includes Victor Kiam, president and chief executive 
of the Remington Products Inc. small appliance company. 
</P>
<P>
The Ruben offer would not include Bonwit Teller stores in Cincinnati, Kansas 
City or Columbia, S.C.

FARLEY INC. UNIT DEFAULTS ON A BIG BANK LOAN 
</P>

<P>
A division of Farley Inc. formed to acquire West Point-Pepperell Inc. said 
Monday that it had defaulted on a $796-million bank loan and would be unable to 
pay interest owed to holders of $705 million in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement increased doubts about the ability of Chicago industrialist 
William Farley to complete his $3-billion acquisition of Pepperell, the giant 
textile maker based in West Point, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Farley officials did not return telephone calls seeking details on the moves 
outlined in a three-paragraph statement issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Farley unit, West Point Acquisition Corp., had offered 
to give stock to junk bond holders in exchange for a delay in making interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
West Point Acquisition also said it had been negotiating with its lenders, a 
consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co. 
apparently in hopes of restructuring the $796-million loan they made to the 
Farley unit last year so it could buy Pepperell stock. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the loan is restructured, analysts said, Farley could be forced into 
bankruptcy proceedings or be obliged to sell assets, possibly including Fruit 
of the Loom Inc., the country's biggest underwear manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
West Point Acquisition said the defaults would not affect West Point-Pepperell, 
which continues to trade as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange 
although the Farley unit owns about 95% of its stock.

MOST REGIONAL STOCKS FALL AS MARKET CHANGES COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: INVESTOR SKITTISHNESS OVER RISING INTEREST RATES AND A SLOWDOWN IN 
TAKEOVERS HAVE REDUCED STOCK PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Prices of most regional stocks fell in this year's first quarter, matching an 
overall decline in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 70 local companies showed losers outpaced gainers by more than 2 to 
1, with 46 stocks declining and 22 advancing. Two were unchanged in the quarter 
ended March 31. Among the stocks losing ground, 29 lost 10% or more of their 
value. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Media General Financial Services of Richmond, Va., 
covered publicly held concerns in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys 
and in Ventura County, with headquarters located from Glendale to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The losses were in step with the first-quarter downturn in the market 
generally, where a slowdown in takeover activity and investor skittishness over 
rising interest rates pushed stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 27% last year, slipped 1.7% in the 
latest quarter, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 composite index 
fell 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index, a broad measure of the over-the-counter market -- 
where most of the local stocks trade -- dropped 4.2% in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winners and losers in the region came from an eclectic mix of 
industries. The gainers included stocks in the computer products, 
telecommunications and entertainment industries. Some of the poor performers 
included savings and loans, hospitals, real estate, waste disposal and 
financial services. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest gainer in the quarter among local issues, just as it was for all of 
1989, was Software Toolworks, a Chatsworth producer of games, teaching 
exercises and other software for personal computers. After nearly tripling in 
price last year, the company climbed another 75% in the quarter to $26 a share. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months ended Dec. 31, Software Toolworks' profit and sales more 
than doubled from year-earlier levels. And last month the company bought 
Mindscape Inc., which makes games for the popular Nintendo computer-game 
system, in a $20-million stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
The worst showing was turned in by Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, an ailing 
Van Nuys-based thrift whose stock tumbled 74% in the quarter to 81 cents a 
share. Federal regulators, having imposed new capital requirements on S&amp;Ls 
to cushion them against future losses, ordered Valley Federal to stop making 
loans and investments until the thrift designs a plan to bolster its capital. 
</P>
<P>
Nu-Med's stock also suffered a setback, falling 41% to $3.38 a share. The 
Encino-based hospital operator has continued to post losses -- in the six 
months that ended Oct. 31 it lost $1.9 million on revenue of $139.4 million. 
Also, Nu-Med said last month that although it completed the sale of a Florida 
hospital for $68 million, its negotiations to sell three other hospitals 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jennings International's Class A stock fell 33% to $5.38 a share 
after the Ventura-based wheelchair maker said it expects to post a net loss of 
$33 million for its fiscal year ended Dec. 1, including $18.5 million for 
restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts' shares also fell despite the company's restructuring efforts, 
which included the Woodland Hills company's repurchase of 20% of its stock for 
$10 a share. The remaining shares closed the quarter at $6.50 a share, down 
28%. The stock has drifted lower since the computer-printer maker fought off a 
takeover threat a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Micropolis, whose financial health and stock price slumped in 
1989, rebounded in this year's first quarter. Its stock rose 32% to $4.63 a 
share as the Chatsworth producer of disk drives, which store computer data, 
reported a smaller loss in its fourth quarter ended Dec. 29, compared with a 
year earlier. The company also has built up its cash reserves, and announced it 
secured $33 million of new credit with its lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Tekelec, a maker of telecommunications testing equipment, also 
gained even though Tekelec's earnings have been slumping of late. The stock 
climbed 27% to $10.75 a share despite the Calabasas company's February 
announcement that its fourth-quarter 1989 profit dropped 36% on a 9% decline in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Flamemaster, a Sun Valley producer of coatings and sealants, joined the biggest 
gainers when its stock rose sharply in the last few days of the quarter. It 
finished the period with a 24% gain to $5.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The jump came after Flamemaster chairman Joseph Mazin said the company expects 
a 59% increase in second-quarter profit, and that he planned to recommend that 
Flamemaster's directors raise the company's common-stock dividend.

<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted murderer Robert Page Anderson, a survivor of three execution dates 
whose appeal overturned capital punishment in California and spared the lives 
of such notorious killers as Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan, holds no pity 
for Robert Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade apart, Anderson and Harris committed murder in San Diego. 
Both were sentenced to die. But while Harris sits today on Death Row at San 
Quentin prison awaiting the gas chamber, Anderson is a free man -- paroled 
after he appealed his sentence for shooting a pawn shop manager. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 appellate decision, which made Anderson briefly famous, overturned 
every death sentence in the state, canceling execution dates for more than 100 
inmates then on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Though Anderson lived, he thinks Harris should die. 
</P>
<P>
"That was wrong, what he did," Anderson said in an interview with The Times 
last week in his $80-a-month Seattle apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"He was way out of line. He could have let those kids go. So I have no pity or 
compassion for somebody like that. I can't, in good conscience, be in his 
corner. I can't. And if those kids' parents sit there in the front row and clap 
when he dies, I still couldn't sympathize with Robert Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want him to live. I want him to die because he killed children." 
</P>
<P>
The words came in a fast clip from the 53-year-old Anderson, his black hair now 
faded white and his cheeks encased in a full gray beard. His beliefs seem harsh 
and contradictory, coming from a man who once stood five days from an execution 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Although Anderson is now a law-and-order advocate who favors gun control and 
supports capital punishment in cases involving children, he maintains that 
execution was wrong for him because he says he killed a man on the spur of the 
moment. He believes Harris, who killed two San Diego high school boys in 1978, 
should be executed because his victims were teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for opponents of capital punishment, Robert Page Anderson today represents 
a living testimonial that there is some good worth saving in every man. 
</P>
<P>
Released from prison in 1976, Anderson has adjusted to life outside without the 
use of his hands, which were crippled in his shoot-out with San Diego police 25 
years ago. He has tutored preschool children at day-care centers and served as 
a counselor for juvenile delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the state Supreme Court used Anderson's case to review the death 
penalty and then abolished that statute as cruel and unusual punishment. The 
Times wrote then that Anderson's "name like those of Gideon and Miranda now 
belongs to history." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Anderson was released from prison and eventually completed 
his parole and slipped out of the state, moving to the Pacific Northwest to 
begin a new life. He tried to forget his past failures and hoped his name would 
never again be heard of by the people of California. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at peace now," he said. "God believes you can rehabilitate yourself, and 
that's what I'm all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the preacher on Death Row said that some crimes you have to pay 
for, but I kept saying I wanted to go home. I told the state that if they would 
let me out, I'd never commit a crime again. I told them, 'Just open up the 
prison door and kick me out.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of people, especially in San Diego, who believe Anderson 
unfairly eluded the gas chamber, feelings they harbor to this day. Among them 
is Allen Brown, the San Diego police officer who shot Anderson 25 years ago. 
"He took another man's life," Brown said of Anderson. "He tried to take mine." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was born in San Diego, an only child raised by a grandmother after his 
parents abandoned him. In his youth, he took up smoking marijuana, grew cocky 
and, although small in stature -- 5-feet, 5-inches tall and barely over 100 
pounds, roughly his size today -- he was difficult to handle. He was nicknamed 
"Rabbit," because he was fast and because he always got away. 
</P>
<P>
At 14, he first went to court for slicing another boy's throat in the school 
gym. He hit another kid with a shovel in reform school. He left school in the 
11th grade and took jobs working construction and washing windows. 
</P>
<P>
On April 8, 1965, he shot and killed the credit manager of a San Diego pawn 
shop, then held police at bay for four hours in a barrage of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson claimed he went to the pawn shop to hock a diamond ring but didn't 
like the way the manager, Louis Richards, 61, treated him. Anderson said he 
asked to see a .30-06 rifle, then loaded it and shot Richards as the credit 
manager bolted for the door. Anderson smashed open the gun cases, snatching up 
bullets as the approaching police sirens grew louder. "I started loading all 
those suckers up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 rounds of ammunition were fired in what was then the biggest 
police shoot-out in San Diego history. Richards died, a policeman and a clerk 
in the pawnshop were wounded. A newspaperman covering the story at the scene 
suffered a heart attack and died. Finally, a police sergeant confronted 
Anderson inside the building and shot him three times at close range with a 
pump-action shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Although seriously wounded, Anderson lived to stand trial, was convicted and 
sent to San Quentin to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting it," he said of the death sentence. "It's like you've seen the 
movie before and you know the ending. I mean, even a blind man would have found 
me guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no illusion, except I thought they were going to take me up there 
and kill me right away and that there would never be this seven years on Death 
Row." 
</P>
<P>
Placed inside Cell No. 18 on Death Row, out of the sunshine, his complexion 
paled and before long, Anderson, known as No. A-91287, was forgotten among his 
condemned brothers, many of whom he befriended and some whose names are legend. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Manson. "Whenever we saw him laugh, we all laughed, saying, 'Who's this 
tough guy?' " Anderson recalled. "He didn't look so tough to us." 
</P>
<P>
Sirhan Sirhan. "He was a likable guy, but he wasn't considered a political 
prisoner. I never heard any bad raps about him." 
</P>
<P>
And Aaron Mitchell, the last man legally put to death in California, who in 
1967 went to the gas chamber with slashed wrists and screaming that he was 
Jesus Christ. "He was a wreck at the end and he cut himself. But I understood. 
I didn't like what he did. I wish he could have been stronger. But I still 
respected him." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was determined not to go the way of Mitchell, even when he was just 
five days from his first execution date in October, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"It was close to Halloween and I had quit smoking and I didn't have the 
cigarettes to fall back on," he said. "But I made up my mind that if they were 
going to kill me, I was not going to go in there crying and sniveling." 
</P>
<P>
He began to read voraciously, devouring George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and 
Homer's "Odyssey," an ancient Greek epic poem about heroic wanderings to 
faraway lands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd want to get on one of those ships and get away," he said. "I'd want to 
sail to the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
His uncle, William Darnell, sent him $10 or $15 a month that Anderson used to 
buy law books. He saved his cigarette money to buy more books. He wrote some of 
his own court petitions, signing them with a crude "X" because his disfigured 
hands could not easily grasp a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson returned a year later to a San Diego jail when the courts granted him 
a new penalty phase in his trial because his original jurors were picked only 
from among proponents of the death penalty. The new hearing brought no relief 
and he was again sentenced to die. He returned to San Quentin and by the early 
1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court was signaling that it was ready to order the 
states to abolish their death statutes. Without waiting for federal court 
action, the state Supreme Court stepped into the controversy and, on the urging 
of ACLU attorneys, docketed the Anderson case for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent ruling, issued in February of 1972, struck down capital 
punishment by calling it "cruel and unusual punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware that many condemned prisoners have committed crimes of the 
utmost cruelty and depravity and that such persons are not entitled to the 
slightest sympathy from society," the court said. "Nevertheless, it is 
incompatible with the dignity of an enlightened society to attempt to justify 
the taking of life for purposes of vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson remembered receiving the news that day. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard it on the radio," he said. "Then all of a sudden it got quiet in 
there. Then somebody started yelling and there was more screaming and it got 
quiet again." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also recalled how he agreed then with the court's ruling about the 
harshness of capital punishment, specifically how the long years under a death 
sentence changed him into a man far different from the one who killed seven 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was cruel and unusual," he said. "It really was. You isolate a man 
up there and take him through all those mental changes just to kill him. Now, 
if you're going to take him one day later and execute him, that's cool. But 
this went on forever for me, and you change. Like a butterfly, you 
metamorphose." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Death Row inmates, Anderson among them, were assimilated into the general 
prison population. "The first week we all got suntans," he said. "We sat out 
there in the prison yard and looked up and said, 'Sun, eat me up! Eat me all 
up!' " 
</P>
<P>
In August of 1976, after a total of 11 years behind bars, he was paroled. 
Dropped off at the prison gate, with three boxes of books and several hundred 
dollars in cash, he caught a ride to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off the bus and just walked around like a tourist, looking at all the 
tall buildings," he said. "Then I got tired and sat right down." 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Seattle, Anderson earned a degree from a community college and 
worked as a teacher-trainee at day-care centers, reading to preschool children 
and escorting them on picnics in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd read stories sitting right there in the circle with them," said Serrena 
Rock, director of the Love's Nest Day Care Center. "He laughed out loud when 
they did funny things and the children, especially the little boys, really 
liked old Robert." 
</P>
<P>
Rock said she was aware Anderson had been in trouble, but never knew the 
gravity of his offense at the time. Even so, she has no regrets about hiring 
him because he did a good job. 
</P>
<P>
He counseled teen-agers at the Seattle juvenile hall to abandon their drug 
habits. Don Crews, who was Anderson's supervisor, marveled at how Anderson 
spoke out about the harshness of his Death Row sentence, and showed young 
offenders how almost any life can be worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's done a very, very good job of working his way back into society," 
Crews said. "I really think he has made some tremendous strides. He's accepted 
the fact that what he's done wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
His Seattle parole officer, Orrie Hewitt, wrote a reference letter in 1983 for 
Anderson describing him as "an honest and trustworthy person. It is my opinion 
that he is of excellent character." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson eventually lost both jobs. New regulations precluded ex-convicts from 
working with children in day-care centers. And juvenile hall staff members 
worried that Anderson could not protect himself with his impaired hands and 
arms against uncontrollable teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployed, he lives today on about $450 a month in Social Security payments. 
He has never married and, except for his uncle and a small group of friends, 
has no visitors in his tiny, two-room apartment. Unable to work manual labor 
because of his hands, he has become a television addict, a throwback from his 
long days in prison with nothing better to do. 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't smoke or drink and his views on many issues seem as 
conventional as the average American's. His worst blunders in post-prison life, 
he said, have been two minor traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Anderson rejected requests from The Times for an interview. At one 
point, he agreed to an interview, but only if The Times would buy him a new 
car. The newspaper turned that down, but Anderson eventually granted the 
interview anyway. 
</P>
<P>
For seven hours in his tiny apartment in a poor neighborhood a week ago Sunday, 
he relived the murder, his years on Death Row and his joy at finally leaving 
prison. He paced about the room, his eyes widening as he waved a steel curtain 
rod through the air, pretending it was the rifle he used to kill the pawn shop 
manager and shoot at police. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm generally right here," he said, gesturing around the room. "I read books, 
look at the television, play chess by myself. I'm not into any clubs or groups. 
I'm a loner. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you see me, I'm going to be myself. I like the quiet. I like the 
peace. The phone won't ring. It will be quiet in here all day after you leave. 
And all night too. And tomorrow."
