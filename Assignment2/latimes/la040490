MIDEAST EDGES INTO BALANCE OF TERROR MODE

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat to strike back with chemical weapons in 
the event of an Israeli attack has formally introduced the deterrent 
balance-of-terror concept to the volatile Middle East, Israeli analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Israel completed the equation by responding with veiled threats of massive 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
This give-and-take Monday gave rhetorical shape to a development long in the 
making: buildups by Israel and the Arab powers, notably Syria and Iraq, to make 
it too costly for either to try to destroy the other. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has its top-secret, if well-known, atomic weapons program. Iraq and 
Syria have chemical weapons and perhaps the capability of delivering them with 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Zeev Eytan, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel 
Aviv, commented: "Hussein's contribution is to make his threat known. Until 
now, he had always denied reports of a chemical buildup or was silent on them. 
Hussein has taken a step to making a deterrent credible. He has announced it." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's open threat has prompted Israel to try to frighten him out of using 
chemical arms. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir assured Hussein that Israel 
harbors no aggressive intentions against anyone -- an apparent effort to allay 
fears that Israel is prepared to launch an attack on Iraqi missile 
installations or chemical weapons plants. 
</P>
<P>
The soft touch was followed by a brandishing of Israel's own deterrent 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is strong, the force is with it, and Iraq is not out of the range of 
our ability to harm it severely," former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said. 
"We should take (Hussein's) words into account. On the other hand, we have a 
smashing response, many-fold stronger than the threats of Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
The "smashing response," Israeli analysts believe, is Israel's stockpile of 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli experts noted that Hussein's threat expanded the potential use of 
chemical weapons beyond what Iraq had dared before. In its war with Iran, Iraq 
used chemical weapons on its own citizens -- Kurdish guerrillas -- and against 
Iranian troops, first to turn them back and later, on at least two occasions, 
to spearhead an offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein stopped short of attacking Iranian cities with chemical weapons, 
something he has now threatened against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the game have changed," said Dore Gold, another researcher at the 
Jaffee Center. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the rules, the language is also changing. Terms like first strike 
and assured destruction are being thrown around, as if the language of the Cold 
War had migrated south. 
</P>
<P>
Many question marks remain in the military balance between Israel and Iraq, 
analysts caution. For example, it is not clear that Iraq actually has the 
binary chemical weapons Hussein apparently alluded to Monday. Binary chemical 
weapons consist of two different chemicals, which are relatively harmless while 
separated but can be deadly when combined. They are the type usually put in 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein may have been referring to some combination such as, say, mustard gas 
and cyanide, rather than truly binary materials, Israeli experts conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
Israel observers have little doubt that Iraq aspires to build such weapons -- 
and to go beyond that. The recent disclosure of an Iraqi attempt to obtain 
triggers for nuclear bombs confirmed that Iraq wants to revive a program to 
make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, according to analyst Gerald Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University, 
Iraq will acquire nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The question," Steinberg said, "is what should Israel's response be? I think 
the Israeli government is moving toward a different position, a position of 
deterrence . . . meaning that any move to deploy those weapons, or attempt to 
put them on missiles or aircraft that could be used against Israel, would lead 
to an Israeli first strike." 
</P>
<P>
Don Kerr, a military analyst with the International Institute for Strategic 
Studies in London, suggested that Hussein's speech was double-edged, meant to 
rattle the chemical saber but, more important, to insist that Iraq is not 
developing a nuclear capability and should not be the target of an Israeli 
preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
By Kerr's reasoning, whatever Iraq may have in terms of chemical warheads, its 
delivery system is not yet ready to threaten Israeli cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a threat of enormous significance" in terms of what damage or loss of 
life the Iraqis might be able to inflict, Kerr said. But it does have other 
effects: It stirs fear, and fear creates instability. 
</P>
<P>
The main message of Hussein's speech, Kerr said, should be read in nuclear 
terms: "Leave me alone, you have no reason to be afraid of me." Of the chemical 
threat, he said, "It represents Hussein to the Arabs as a strongman." 
</P>
<P>
If Israel perceives a real threat in Iraq's chemical arsenal, it is faced with 
a dilemma in terms of its response. The Israeli armed forces have a limited 
number of chemical weapons, Israeli officials have said, and only for 
experimental purposes. That leaves Israel with conventional weapons -- rifles, 
artillery, tanks and jets -- or nuclear weapons, with nothing in between for a 
calibrated response. 
</P>
<P>
A military source said: "What would be Israel's answer to a chemical attack? Or 
its use on the battlefield? Nuclear? It's something that has to be considered." 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing perception that Israel will not launch a preemptive strike 
to destroy either Iraqi missiles or chemical weapons facilities. Israeli 
warplanes knocked out an Iraqi nuclear reactor nine years ago, but times have 
changed, experts here say. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the attack on the reactor, Iraq was preoccupied with its war 
with Iran. (That conflict is now on hold after a cease-fire was signed in 
August, 1988.) Also, Iraq lacked the missile punch to hit Israel from afar. 
Recently, Hussein has placed missiles within range of Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli observers still view Syria, which has troops within minutes of 
Israel's borders, as a greater threat than the Baghdad government. Iraq must 
still keep an eye out for Iran. In addition, Iraq's large armies would need 
three days to cross Jordan and arrive at Israeli-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
"You can create a lot of havoc with chemical weapons," Arye Shalev, a retired 
army general, suggested, "but you can't conquer a country with them. You need 
the troops on the ground for that." 
</P>

Nicosia, Cyprus.

<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
International law forbids the use of chemical weapons but not their manufacture 
or stockpiling. The United States and Soviet Union are known to have sizable 
stockpiles of nerve gases and similar chemical weapons. According to the 
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, at least eight other 
countries are reliably reported to have them: Afghanistan, France, Iran, Iraq, 
North Korea, Libya, Syria and Vietnam. In addition, six other countries -- 
Myanmar (Burma), China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel and Taiwan -- are thought to 
have such weapons.

L.A. TO GIVE ADDICTS AIDS KITS OF CONDOMS, BLEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved distribution of 
bleach and condoms to fight the spread of AIDS among drug users. 
</P>
<P>
The action was requested by Mayor Tom Bradley, who called it "a matter of human 
decency." 
</P>
<P>
The council set aside $25,000 to finance the bleach-and-condom program until 
the fiscal year ends on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The money will pay for about 60,000 AIDS prevention kits, each containing a 
bottle of bleach for sterilizing needles, one or more condoms and an 
informational flyer about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"By making bleach and condoms readily available to those most vulnerable, we 
can help eradicate this scourge," Bradley said Tuesday in a letter to 
Councilman Joel Wachs, who sponsored the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The bleach-and-condom kits will be distributed by five drug-abuse agencies in 
locations around the city, said Dave Johnson, the city's AIDS coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a street outreach program," Johnson said. "People will be taking the 
kits out to where the addicts are." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal encountered virtually no opposition from council members, who 
approved it without debate. However, they reopened the matter after an angry 
outburst from people in the audience who demanded a chance to speak. 
</P>
<P>
John Coulthard, a spokesman for an activist organization called The Facts, said 
the program will encourage intravenous drug use. "This is not the type of 
message the City Council should be sending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In February, New York City Mayor David Dinkins halted a program to distribute 
clean needles to drug users after complaints that the program abetted drug use. 
The Los Angeles program does not include distribution of needles. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the evidence that this project will even work?" said Brian Misuraca, 
another member of the Sherman Oaks-based group. 
</P>
<P>
The comments drew a sharp response from Councilman Robert Farrell, whose 
district includes poor areas of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"These white boys aren't going to die," Farrell said of the program's critics. 
"The facts show that white boys like that have sufficient money in their 
pockets and they have sufficient education and whatever they've got going. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are sick they will buy the medication, they will make the personal 
choice because they know what to do. They have been blessed by being 
middle-class persons." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre called the protesters "somewhat narrow-minded" and 
said AIDS is a "crisis of astronomical proportions" in poor areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in his letter, had anticipated criticism and noted: "It is disturbing 
to me to see the senseless opposition to this proposal that will help us save 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the AIDS coordinator, said the private, nonprofit agencies to be used 
in the program already are running outreach efforts of their own for 
intravenous drug users. He said some of the agencies have provided bleach and 
condoms occasionally out of their own funds. 
</P>
<P>
Another $50,000 has been requested for bleach and condoms in the 1990-91 fiscal 
year, as well as $450,000 for other AIDS prevention and education programs, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS generally is spread by the sharing of needles by drug addicts and through 
sexual contact. The informational pamphlets in the kits will have instructions 
for sterilizing needles with bleach so that addicts don't transmit the virus to 
each other. The condoms are intended to prevent the spread of the virus to 
sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to other cities, Wachs said, Los Angeles has a substantially lower 
rate of AIDS-infected drug addicts. Unless steps are taken now, "the spread is 
going to be enormous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real smoking gun here," Wachs said. "We have a really explosive 
situation of a potential increase in the community of drug users. People have 
had their heads in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
The agencies that will distribute the kits are El Centro Del Pueblo in the 
Hollywood and Silverlake areas; El Centro Human Services in East Los Angeles; 
El Proyecto Del Barrio in the San Fernando Valley; Women and AIDS Risk Network 
in South-Central Los Angeles, and Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse in the downtown and Skid Row areas. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a $60,000 appropriation for other AIDS-fighting 
measures, including a centralized information and referral service, an early 
treatment and awareness program in racial and ethnic minority communities, and 
a public awareness campaign in South-Central and East Los Angeles.

SOVIETS TOUGHEN SECESSION RULES; 
</P>
<P>
INDEPENDENCE: THE NEW LAW IS IMMEDIATELY REJECTED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 
RESTIVE BALTIC REPUBLICS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With pressures for independence building on the fringes of the Soviet empire, 
the Soviet legislature overwhelmingly passed a law Tuesday fixing tough 
requirements for member republics to secede and giving President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev sweeping powers to declare states of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The secession law passed by the Supreme Soviet requires a two-thirds vote by a 
republic's residents in a referendum, a five-year transition period for 
settling property and other questions, approval by the Congress of People's 
Deputies in Moscow and payment by the seceding republic of resettlement 
expenses for those who oppose independence and leave. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislation is a keystone in Gorbachev's program for what he terms a 
new "Soviet federation" based not on coercion and force, but on consensus. 
</P>
<P>
But the new secession law was rejected immediately by representatives of the 
restive Baltic republics, and a representative of the breakaway government of 
Lithuania called it window dressing for reasserting Moscow's rule. 
</P>
<P>
"It's purely decorative -- it's not a law about leaving, but a law about not 
leaving," legislator Nikolai Medvedev told a news conference at the Lithuanian 
delegation offices in the Soviet capital. "It's an escape valve, but one 
without an opening." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians rushed to proclaim independence March 11, in part because they 
feared that the strictures of a new secession law would be applied to them if 
they waited. But Gorbachev has rejected their declaration as illegal and 
demanded that they revoke it, a step the Lithuanians have refused. 
</P>
<P>
After a war of nerves lasting more than three weeks, a compromise suddenly 
seemed possible Tuesday afternoon when three Lithuanian envoys led by Deputy 
Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas were received for talks by Politburo member and 
key Gorbachev ally Alexander N. Yakovlev at an undisclosed Moscow site. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot call it a delegation for negotiations; you can call it a goodwill 
mission," Lithuania's representative in Moscow, Egidius Bickauskas, told the 
reporters gathered at the Lithuanian mission. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level contact between the Lithuanians and Moscow since 
just after the independence proclamation, and it could portend a negotiated end 
to a stalemate marked by the occupation of Lithuanian buildings by Soviet 
troops, the buzzing of cities in the Ireland-sized republic by military planes 
and other Kremlin strong-arm tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are people who are ready to listen, I think it's very good," 
Bickauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
No details were available on the talks, which the Lithuanians said lasted so 
long that the news conference called at their mission to discuss the results 
broke up without Ozolas and the other envoys ever arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Polish Foreign Ministry said in Warsaw that Soviet authorities 
have restricted traffic at Lithuania's border with Poland, the republic's only 
international border. The Polish news agency PAP said Soviet officials informed 
their Polish counterparts that the crossing from Ogrodniki, Poland, to 
Lazdijai, Lithuania, was "temporarily" closed. 
</P>
<P>
The secession law, whose provisions were toughened in the final draft, requires 
that any of the 15 constituent Soviet republics wanting to exercise the right 
to secede guaranteed by the 1977 Soviet constitution must hold a referendum and 
win the support of two-thirds of its permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
During a five-year transition period, negotiations would be held to settle 
financial, property and other questions -- such as who owns factories now under 
the control of Moscow-based ministries. The Congress of People's Deputies, the 
nation's top parliamentary body, would have to approve the outcome, giving it 
the right to veto any accord. 
</P>
<P>
The toughened version of the law also requires the republic to pay the expenses 
of people who leave because they oppose independence. About 9% of Lithuania's 
3.7 million people are ethnic Russians, most of whom are against secession. The 
cost of resettling them would thus be a substantial part of the independence 
tab. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Gryazin, an Estonian deputy watching the debate in the Supreme Soviet as 
an observer, said his republic would ignore the law. Estonia's legislature 
declared its own step-by-step path out of the Soviet Union last week, condemned 
Kremlin pressure on Lithuania and expressed support for its independence drive 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Georgian lawmaker Tengiz P. Buachidze also criticized the law as too tough and 
announced that the entire delegation of his southern republic would vote 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the legislation passed by lopsided majorities in separate votes 
in both chambers of the 542-member Supreme Soviet, and it will enter into force 
when it is published. By a large margin, the Council of the Union also passed 
the bill on states of emergency that was approved Monday by the other chamber, 
the Council of Nationalities, meaning it becomes law as well. 
</P>
<P>
That legislation empowers Gorbachev to declare states of emergency in the 
republics during which authorities can confiscate firearms, ban rallies and 
strikes, censor the media and suspend activities of political parties. 
</P>
<P>
If local police and the KGB prove incapable of restoring order, Gorbachev can 
impose direct presidential rule, a provision local activists say can be used to 
neutralize the actions of an independence-minded republic. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most worrisome for the growing number of independence advocates on the 
Soviet periphery, the secession law provides for dismembering their republics 
if ethnic minorities populating a given district opt out of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, so-called autonomous republics or regions like the predominantly 
Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh that has been a part of Azerbaijan since 
the 1920s would have the right to decide by themselves for or against 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Since demographics in this land of more than 100 nationalities are often an 
ethnic crazy quilt, as in valleys where Georgians, Azerbaijanis and other 
groups have lived side by side in the Caucasus for centuries, independence 
could provoke the breakup of a republic into independent and pro-Moscow areas, 
a provision of the law certain to discourage secession. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, republics could also be shorn of lands they did not have 
when they joined the Soviet Union, another good argument for not tampering with 
the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Byelorussia has already laid claims to tracts it said were given Lithuania 
after it became a Soviet republic in 1940, even including the present-day 
capital of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians maintain that Soviet law does not apply 
to them since their homelands did not voluntarily join the Soviet Union but 
were forcibly annexed by Josef Stalin's Kremlin under a secret agreement with 
Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev's new press secretary, who gave his first briefing for 
journalists Tuesday inside the Kremlin, indicated that no exceptions would be 
made for the Baltic republics when asked about the current legal status of 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania is part of the U.S.S.R., and all questions pertaining to the state 
structure of the republic and the problem of being in or out of the Soviet 
federation can be solved exclusively on a constitutional basis, even if that 
basis is not to somebody's liking," Arkady A. Maslennikov said.

DEFENSE SAYS MARCOS HEEDED BUSH'S ADVICE 
</P>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos stashed millions of dollars in 
overseas banks and secretly invested in New York real estate to accumulate a 
"defense fund" to finance recovery of his country if communist insurgents took 
over, an attorney for his widow said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He did it to be able to buy guns and whatever else would be required to "take 
back his country," said attorney Gerry Spence. And he did it because that is 
"what the CIA told him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Spence, representing Imelda Marcos in her fraud, racketeering and conspiracy 
trial, also said that four prime Manhattan properties were purchased at the 
urging of then-Vice President George Bush, who Spence said he would try to call 
as a witness. Bush met with the Marcoses in Manila in June, 1981, and was 
concerned about the possibility of Philippine investments going to Libya, the 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Bush) said he didn't want the Marcoses to deal with (Moammar) Kadafi. He 
said to them, 'why don't you invest in American real estate?' " Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
"So the Marcoses, in an attempt to keep the goodwill of the United States, 
abandoned their idea of investing in Libya and began to buy real estate in 
Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Stephen Hart said there would be no comment about 
allegations in a continuing criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising assertions came in opening statements in federal court where 
Mrs. Marcos went on trial Tuesday along with Saudi Arabian financier Adnan 
Khashoggi. The trial is expected to last three to four months. 
</P>
<P>
To federal prosecutors, armed with hundreds of thousands of financial documents 
-- much of it obtained from former Marcos associates, international banks and 
the Philippine government -- the case is "about theft, fraud and deceit on an 
incredible scale." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Livingston said Mrs. Marcos used the Philippine 
treasury as her "own personal piggy bank" and plundered her impoverished 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The money that flooded into New York was stolen money," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that she and her husband embezzled and diverted funds 
from the Philippine treasury. More than $300 million was invested in the United 
States with the help of Khashoggi and covered up through the use of forged 
documents, the government contends. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos appeared troubled and occasionally tearful as Livingston accused 
her of being "partners in crime" with her dead husband. 
</P>
<P>
But the most dramatic arguments came when Spence rose to weave a tale of 
international intrigue, the communist menace and a mysterious gold treasure -- 
at times taking little care to deal with historical inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Spence said that when Marcos seized dictatorial control of the 
Philippines in 1972 it was to protect the nation from 25,000 to 30,000 armed 
communists. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, CIA estimates at the time indicated that the communist New People's 
Army had only about 100 armed men. And the first 50 people arrested as 
subversives under martial law were not communists, but Marcos' political foes 
(including the late opposition leader Benigno Aquino, the assassinated husband 
of current President Corazon Aquino), priests and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Amid repeated objections by the prosecution -- and increasingly stern warnings 
from U.S. District Judge John Keenan -- Spence tried to characterize Marcos as 
"a loyal supporter of America" and a close friend of American presidents, 
especially Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said the Marcoses moved millions of dollars out of the Philippines 
in the 1970s and 1980s because they feared a communist takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"Armed communists were about to take over the country (in 1972). You don't 
protect funds from a communist takeover unless you hide them," Spence said, 
conceding a prosecution claim that the former president and his wife had secret 
bank accounts in such places as Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"The CIA knew all about it. It was an open secret between the CIA and the 
Marcoses." 
</P>
<P>
Spence said the CIA "was aware of every transaction that took place in this 
case." And he said that U.S. leaders "knew every step of the way what (Marcos) 
was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Spence also argued that much of the money Marcos transferred to foreign bank 
accounts was his own. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very wealthy man" even before he became president, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources of the Marcos wealth, Spence said, were investments in Philippine 
industry and discovery of a gold cache abandoned during World War II by the 
Japanese: "Yamashita's treasure." 
</P>
<P>
According to Spence, an old man he identified only as "Rubio" will testify that 
he helped Marcos take the gold left behind by the Japanese general who 
commanded the occupying forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Rubio says that about twice a week (he and Marcos) would make the trip into 
the northern Philippines by car and fill it full of gold," Spence told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Spence also repeated his claim that the Marcoses did not intend to go to Hawaii 
when they fled the presidential palace at Malacanang in the face of a popular 
revolt in February, 1986. He said they expected to be taken to the Marcos 
family home in Ilocos Norte, a northern province of the Philippines, but were 
taken to Guam instead. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Keenan sharply rebuked Spence in front of the jurors for making that 
claim. Earlier, in pretrial proceedings, the judge had ruled against a defense 
argument that the Marcoses were kidnaped by federal authorities, citing a 
letter from Imelda Marcos to then-First Lady Nancy Reagan thanking her and 
President Reagan for their help and hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
"You're skating very close to where you'd better not skate, sir," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan raised his voice on a number of occasions -- once interrupting Spence as 
he started to tell jurors they did not represent a jury of Mrs. Marcos' peers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Mrs. (George) Bush being tried by a Philippine jury," Spence said to 
a stern rebuke from Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
Spence said that while prosecutors have depicted Mrs. Marcos as "this obscene, 
ugly spender," she was once a barefoot, impoverished child who came to own a 
vast shoe collection only because she was showered with ill-fitting gifts by 
Philippine shoe companies. 
</P>
<P>
From its outset the prosecution's case as outlined in Livingston's 90-minute 
statement seemed designed to focus on the widow and not the dead dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't just his wife," Livingston said, noting that Mrs. Marcos was mayor 
of Manila and a Cabinet minister responsible for a government agency the 
prosecutor compared to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Together, she said, the Marcoses earned about $20,000 a year. The rest, she 
said, came from bribes, kickbacks, embezzlement, theft and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said a "spider's web" of deceit stretched from Manila to New York 
and included Swiss bank accounts, offshore corporations, shell companies and 
"bundles and bundles" of cash delivered to Marcos at her Waldorf-Astoria Hotel 
suite here.

banks and bought New York real estate to accumulate a "defense fund" against 
Communist insurgents. The lawyer, representing Imelda Marcos as her fraud and 
racketeering trial opened in New York, maintained that the money was to be used 
to "take back (the) country" from rebels. But prosecutors maintained the case 
is "about theft, fraud and deceit on an incredible scale." An unruly crowd 
greeted Marcos and Spence, left, at the courthouse. Reuters

STATE LOOKS INTO HOME BUILDER'S RADON DISCLAIMERS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: OFFICIALS ASK SOUTHLAND FIRM TO SUSPEND SALES UNTIL LEGALITY OF 
THE CONTRACT CLAUSE IS DETERMINED.

The state Department of Real Estate has asked a major California developer to 
stop selling homes and condominiums until state officials review a section of 
the company's contract with prospective home buyers that prevents them from 
inspecting for radon before the close of escrow, the department commissioner 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner James Edmonds said the department verbally made the request to 
Pardee Construction Co. officials Tuesday after real estate attorneys 
discovered that the state did not have a copy of the contract in the company's 
public document report, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Once the department receives a copy of the contract, Edmonds said, Department 
of Real Estate attorneys will review it and decide whether the section on radon 
-- which also asks customers not to hold the company responsible if the 
radioactive gas is found after the sale is completed -- is lawful. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Department of Real Estate, Pardee is the first 
major developer in the state to place such restraints on potential home buyers 
since the radon gas danger was revealed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds said the Real Estate Department has no legal authority to require 
Pardee -- which has developments under way in the Antelope Valley and in 
Ventura, Riverside and San Diego counties -- to stop selling property. But he 
said he hopes it will do so out of good faith. 
</P>
<P>
If Pardee fails to honor the request, Edmonds said he will ask the state 
attorney general's office to investigate the radon disclaimers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have verbally asked them to cease sales until we get (the contract)," 
Edmonds said. "We want them to disclose what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds said his department made the request to protect home buyers. He said 
the department was not aware of the company's radon disclaimers until contacted 
by The Times last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Herschel Elkins, a senior assistant attorney general, said attorneys 
already are seeking more information on the issue but have not yet started a 
formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a potential problem," Elkins said. "It's one we'll have to examine." 
</P>
<P>
A Pardee official acknowledged last week that the company had begun asking 
buyers to sign the contracts as an added protection after an East Coast 
developer was sued by a customer who discovered radon after purchasing a home. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be a little extra cautious," said Bernie Yantz, Pardee's assistant vice 
president of California sales. "It's an extra step we're taking to protect 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Yantz said the company would not sell a home to any customer who refused to 
sign the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Radon, believed to be the second most frequent cause of lung cancer in the 
United States, is produced by the natural decay of uranium and is present in 
soil everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
According to the first statewide residential radon study completed recently, 
levels of the cancer-causing gas in Ventura County were among the highest in 
the state. Researchers monitored 385 houses in California, including 15 in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Although only 1% of the houses surveyed statewide exceeded the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's recommended maximum radon concentration of 4 
picocuries per liter, in Ventura County it was estimated that between 10% and 
15% of houses could exceed the standard.

VAN DE KAMP, FEINSTEIN TAKE TENTATIVE STABS AT BIG PROBLEMS

<P>
As they travel, the two Democratic candidates for governor share a lament: 
California lacks for big dreams in its politics these days. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp share something else as well -- they 
find it painfully difficult to offer up dreams that are quite as big as 
California's problems without risking the much-feared label of "big spender." 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness poses such a challenge, and both contenders were enticed to a 
statewide housing conference Tuesday to try to take its measure. Their 
differing approaches highlighted a choice that awaits voters in the June 5 
primary -- a choice in executive styles of governance between two contenders 
with more or less similar hopes for a prosperous future. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, the state attorney general, proposed starting small and specific 
in trying to stop homelessness before it happens. Voters have lost faith in the 
state's ability to accomplish much at all, he said, so they have got to be 
shown incremental results. 
</P>
<P>
His idea was simple: Provide emergency loans for mortgage payments or rent to 
those who face eviction because they cannot pay their bills due to some 
short-term personal calamity, such as divorce or job layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said a $5-million effort would help 3,000 families a year for 
starters, and maybe up to 50,000 individuals over five years. Presently, most 
such emergency housing aid is available only to people who already are on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I present this program not as an end, but as a beginning -- a down payment if 
you will -- on a new era of pragmatism and compassion in state government," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, acknowledged the need to form a 
social consensus before proceeding on such a big problem as homelessness. Her 
answer, as it has been on a growing list of issues, was to propose a commission 
to get the debate started. 
</P>
<P>
Or, in the case of housing, she called for two commissions. 
</P>
<P>
First, she supported a pending bill in the Legislature to establish a "working 
group on the integration of homeless services." And she added a call for a 
"working group on affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
These groups would bring to the negotiating table housing advocates, local 
governments and state officials "to develop those kinds of programs that can 
provide the proper prescriptions." 
</P>
<P>
"A society that steps over and around people sleeping on grates isn't much of a 
society," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The two disagreed on one element of homeless policy, however. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp seemed to side with a Santa Barbara man who complained of police 
harassment of homeless people who sleep in local parks. Van de Kamp was 
applauded when he said the police needed some "major sensitivity training." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was asked a similar question by a homeless man from Santa Cruz. But 
she was hissed when she answered, "I do not believe people are well served, nor 
the homeless well served, by homeless sleeping on streets and in parks." 
</P>
<P>
On broader housing policy, Feinstein told the 700 officials and private housing 
activists that California needs to expedite the sale of millions of dollars in 
housing bonds approved by voters in past elections. 
</P>
<P>
She said her experience as mayor for two terms convinced her that property 
developers should be forced to contribute to affordable housing. "I am reminded 
of the words of President Kennedy," Feinstein said. " 'If government cannot 
save the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.' " 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said his administration would be composed of appointees "who 
actually want to help people find homes" and who "will not allow local 
redevelopment agencies to skate around their legal obligation to provide low- 
and moderate-income housing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A new day is coming -- not a day when housing problems will disappear, but a 
day when our commitments as a society to tackling those problems will reappear. 
. . . It's time we dreamed again in California."

MRS. BUSH CREDITS RADIATION WITH ENDING DOUBLE VISION

Barbara Bush said Tuesday that she no longer suffers double vision caused by 
Graves disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week was the first week without seeing double," she told reporters at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the radiation worked. That's very good news." 
</P>
<P>
The First Lady was referring to radiation treatments that she underwent in 
January. Aides had said it would take two to four months to determine whether 
the treatment was effective. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mrs. Bush said that she had not been evaluated recently by 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush was determined early last year to have Graves disease, an immune 
system disorder that initially attacked her thyroid, causing dramatic weight 
loss. It also caused eye irritation and double vision, especially in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
She talked with two reporters Tuesday morning after surprising tourists by 
showing up in the White House main foyer, through which tours pass. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush held a small ceremony at the foot of the grand staircase to receive 
new editions of "The Presidents of the United States" and "The First Ladies" 
from White House Historical Assn. President Robert L. Breeden. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 tourists gathered to hear Breeden and Mrs. Bush, who autographed 
several copies of the books. She opened one to a page with her husband's 
picture and held it up for the crowd's applause. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush said she was glad to be asked about her health, adding that reports 
that she is not doing well are fabricated. She has acknowledged frustration 
with the eye irritation, which persisted after the thyroid condition improved. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors prescribed the steroid prednisone to treat her eyes and resorted to 
radiation treatments when drugs had no effect.

3 KEY STEPS CUT RISK TO HEART, STUDY REPORTS

<P>
Six thousand middle-aged men who were at high risk of developing heart disease 
have cut their chance of dying of a heart attack by nearly 25% as a result of 
quitting smoking, lowering their cholesterol levels through diet and taking 
drugs to treat high blood pressure, according to a report being published 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., appear to 
confirm the widely held assumption that common-sense steps to modify the 
behavior and treatment of those at risk for heart disease can significantly 
increase their life span. 
</P>
<P>
They also appear to vindicate the controversial, multimillion-dollar 12,800-man 
Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) that was criticized when it 
ended in 1982 because it was initially unable to show any difference in the 
health of men given special treatment for smoking, high blood pressure and diet 
and those who received more typical care. 
</P>
<P>
"This may not entirely settle the debate over things like cholesterol," said 
Marcus Kjelsberg, director of the coordinating center for the MRFIT. "But it's 
an important piece of the puzzle. It suggests that there is a real benefit to 
intervening on these risk factors." 
</P>
<P>
The MRFIT study began in the early 1970s, following two groups of just over 
6,000 men between the ages of 35 and 57 who were judged to be at high risk for 
heart disease because they smoked, had high blood pressure and high 
cholesterol. One group received normal care. The other was given dietary advice 
to lower cholesterol levels, medication to lower blood pressure and counseling 
to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
When the study ended in 1982, after each group had been followed for about 
seven years, there appeared to be no difference in death rates. Today's article 
reports on the two groups three years later, or 10 years after the study began. 
</P>
<P>
This time the researchers found a dramatically lower incidence of fatal heart 
attacks, and an overall mortality rate for all causes that was 7.7% lower among 
those men given special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Preventing heart disease is not like treating a cold or a headache," said 
Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
which sponsored the study. "It takes years to build up the risk and it takes 
years to eliminate it." 
</P>
<P>
The results do not address the question of which of the three risk factors is 
most to blame for causing heart disease.

HOUSE OKS $720 MILLION IN AID TO NICARAGUA, PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE THREATENING TO DELAY SOME FUNDS. BUSH WANTS 
ACTION BY THURSDAY.

<P>
The House gave overwhelming, bipartisan approval Tuesday to $720 million in 
economic aid for Nicaragua and Panama, meeting President Bush's request for 
speedy action. But Senate Democratic leaders continued on a partisan course 
likely to result in funding delays. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, while praising the 
Democratic-controlled House for its support, warned that "democracy could be at 
risk in Central America" if the Senate fails to complete action by Thursday, as 
Bush requested. 
</P>
<P>
Brushing off the warning, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
stood by his demand that the Administration first produce a long-range plan for 
providing aid to an expanding list of countries. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell suggested that the Senate would go along with approving a limited sum 
for Panama and Nicaragua this week, withholding action on the rest until a 
broad foreign aid plan is presented. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler promised talks on such a plan but said that funding for Nicaragua and 
Panama should not be held "hostage" in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush, speaking to reporters as he flew aboard Air Force One during a day of 
political fund-raising in Indianapolis and Dearborn, Mich., said, "It is 
absolutely essential that we get funding for both Nicaragua and Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Mitchell's criticism that he had presented a "jigsaw puzzle" 
instead of a comprehensive foreign aid plan, Bush said: "There's no jigsaw 
puzzle when it comes to what is best for democracy in Nicaragua and no jigsaw 
puzzle when it comes to what is best for Panama." 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), although clearly inclined to give the 
President full cooperation, signaled that he was acceding to the partisan 
strategy of Mitchell and other Senate Democratic leaders, including 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.). 
</P>
<P>
Foley conceded that Congress might pass only a modest down payment to Panama 
and Nicaragua before going on a 12-day recess Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing probably is to provide some assurance . . . that we are 
going to provide assistance," he said. "We probably will provide most of this 
aid, if not all of it, but on a schedule perhaps slightly less urgent than the 
Administration is suggesting." 
</P>
<P>
The House, on a vote of 362 to 59, approved taking $720 million from U.S. 
defense programs to help repair the battered economies and boost the new 
governments in the two Central American countries. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation largely meets Bush's March 13 request for "urgent" economic aid 
"to advance the prospect for democracy" in both nations. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides all $300 million sought by the President to assist the newly 
elected anti-Sandinista government in Nicaragua. A $30-million sum is earmarked 
for the demobilization of the Contras, Nicaraguan rebels long backed by the 
Reagan and Bush administrations.

Two Sichuan farmers lost court appeals and were executed for selling the skins 
of giant pandas, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Liang Yongzheng and He Guanghai, from Pingwu County in the southwest Chinese 
province, were sentenced to death in October for dealing in the endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Daily reported Tuesday that the two were executed Monday after losing 
appeals in the Sichuan provincial court and the Supreme Court. It said Liang 
bought a panda skin in January, 1987, for $957 and with an accomplice sold it 
in Canton for $17,000.

ISRAEL LAUNCHES SATELLITE; SPY ROLE RUMORED;

MIDDLE EAST: THE GOVERNMENT SAYS OFEK 2 IS A RESEARCH CRAFT. THE SPACE SHOT 
COMES AMID A REGIONAL MISSILE RACE.

<P>
Israel on Tuesday launched a satellite widely believed to be capable of spying 
on its neighbors in the Middle East, a region springing headlong into the 
missile age. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials denied persistent reports that the satellite, called Ofek 
2, carries sophisticated optics. The 352-pound probe is equipped only with 
communications and testing equipment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The launch, which had been anticipated for weeks, took place a day after Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein threatened to retaliate with chemical weapons if 
Israel attacked any of Baghdad's military or weapons-making installations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the proof for the high level of technology in Israel was given today," 
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said after the launch Tuesday. "The defense 
technology of the state of Israel is of a high level; I would say far higher 
than that of Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who is trying to form a new government, 
said the launching should help deter Hussein. "If he wants to deal with Israel, 
he should look for other means than the military one," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir declared: "Our strength and ability are 
conditioned by enterprise, scientific capabilities and performances, as 
executed in the launching of the second satellite." 
</P>
<P>
As the rocket arced westward through the cloudless Mediterranean sky, school 
buses along coastal roads reportedly stopped to let their passengers view its 
fiery ascent. Israel Radio interrupted its programming at 3 p.m. to broadcast 
the sound of the rocket roaring into space. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite was launched atop a rocket called the Shavit, or Comet. The 
Shavit is a version of Israel's Jericho 2 missile. 
</P>
<P>
Israel first launched a satellite in September, 1988, when it put an Ofek 1 
experimental probe into orbit. The first Ofek -- the name means Horizon -- was 
also reported to be carrying surveillance equipment. Ofek 1 burned up in the 
atmosphere four months later. It had been scheduled to last a month in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Ofek 2 is scheduled to survive for four months. 
</P>
<P>
The new satellite completes one revolution every 90 minutes in an elliptical 
orbit, swinging to within 130 miles of Earth at its lowest point and 923 miles 
at its highest, according to Israel Aircraft Industries, builder of the 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Yuvaal Neeman, director of Israel's space agency, described the launch as 
experimental, like the Ofek 1. "The only difference is that we can call the 
satellite and send it messages and receive answers back," Neeman said. "This 
satellite has no cameras. It is not carrying any cargo that carries out a job." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the satellite is equipped with an improved gyroscope, better 
protection against cosmic rays and a larger computer memory than Ofek 1. 
</P>
<P>
Spy satellites would provide Israel with especially valuable military data. 
First, they can detect troop movements, giving Israel valuable time to mobilize 
its own reserve forces. 
</P>
<P>
If a satellite is placed in a stationary orbit, Israel would also be able to 
watch out for hostile missile launches and gain an edge in civil defense, 
interception and retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East is in a galloping missile race. Syria has acquired missiles 
that can reach Israeli cities. Egypt is working on a missile in partnership 
with Argentina. Iraq is also developing a missile, and apparently has made 
rapid progress. Last December, the Iraqi government announced that it had sent 
a rocket into space and was planning to follow the launch with a spy satellite 
program of its own. 
</P>
<P>
All of this missile activity has eroded one of the pillars of Israeli security: 
air superiority. Missiles from hostile neighbors can now reach Israeli cities; 
enemy jets run the risk of meeting Israel's highly effective air force. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's own Jericho 2 missile has a range of about 900 miles. The latest 
launch means Israel is capable of sending heavy surface-to-surface payloads up 
to 3,000 miles, noted Zeev Eytan, an expert at the Jaffee Center for Strategic 
Studies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
"But the question is, do we need such a missile. I wouldn't think Israel has 
that in mind," Eytan said.

GORBACHEV PRESS AIDE 'NOT FITZWATER'

<P>
Last month, the Soviet Union got its first U.S.-style executive presidency. On 
Tuesday, it got a presidential press secretary, Arkady A. Maslennikov, who will 
brief reporters on the words and deeds of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a 
new move toward greater political openness. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kremlin is not the White House, and Maslennikov said he will operate 
differently from Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I am not Fitzwater, I am Maslennikov," the 58-year-old 
journalist said, acknowledging that he lacks the practiced smoothness that 
American spokesmen are seen here as having. "That is to say, the first 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
The second difference perhaps is that Maslennikov has one telephone and no 
assistants, in contrast to the massive White House press office . 
</P>
<P>
Standing before a large picture showing the Bolshevik leader V. I. Lenin 
exhorting the masses on Red Square, Maslennikov pledged that there will be 
frequent, but not daily, briefings at the Kremlin for Soviet and foreign 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Any subject may be brought up, he said, although he plans to focus each 
briefing on key issues. Gorbachev himself will hold open press conferences from 
time to time, Maslennikov said. 
</P>
<P>
He was prepared Tuesday for questions on Lithuania -- the next step is up to 
the Lithuanian leadership, not Moscow, he said -- but he had little to say on 
economic issues despite a raging debate over controversial economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He could offer a few words on Soviet-American relations and the "very important 
talks" that Eduard A. Shevardnadze will hold there this week with Bush and 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. But he had to plead ignorance when asked 
Gorbachev's agenda for the next two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
When asked where Gorbachev would live -- his apartment in Lenin Hills, the 
dacha west of the capital where he spends much of the year or, perhaps, in the 
Kremlin -- Maslennikov seem perplexed, and even more so when asked how much 
Gorbachev was paid as the country's executive president. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not quite sure that Gorbachev will live here," he said. "But, no doubt, 
it is going to be his working office." 
</P>
<P>
Maslennikov's appointment should help the government's efforts to open Soviet 
society and allow people to participate more actively in their government. But 
it also reflects Gorbachev's growing personal authority. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Gennady I. Gerasimov, the chief Foreign Ministry spokesmen for 
nearly five years and thus the face of Kremlin policy, seems likely to be 
diminished as Maslennikov's grows. 
</P>
<P>
Maslennikov, who was trained as an economist, worked as a journalist for 25 
years, including six years in India and three years in Pakistan. He then became 
editor of the Western nations desk of Pravda before moving to the Supreme 
Soviet as its public information officer.

LITHUANIA ON BAKER'S AGENDA FOR TALKS WITH SHEVARDNADZE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will seek new assurances about Soviet 
treatment of Lithuania from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
during three days of talks between the two officials, U.S. officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
During sessions that begin today in Washington, Baker also is expected to ask 
Shevardnadze for an explanation of the clandestine transfers of SS-23 missiles 
from the Soviet Union to three East European allies, other officials said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Lithuania "will be at the 
top of (Baker's) agenda" after Moscow's recent efforts to rein in the 
secession-minded Baltic state. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting Shevardnadze in Namibia two weeks ago, Baker said he had been 
assured that Moscow would not use force to crush the Lithuanian independence 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said the secretary of state would seek more specific 
assurances this week on how far the Soviets expect to carry their campaign of 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, meanwhile, said he hopes that Shevardnadze's visit will produce 
a date for his next summit conference with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. The meeting is expected to take place in Washington during the 
second half of June. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get that determined," Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One as 
he flew from Indiana to Michigan during a day of political fund-raising 
speeches in Indianapolis and Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had not yet received a personal reply to the message he dispatched 
to Gorbachev last Thursday. In the message, Bush was said to have appealed for 
a peaceful solution to the Lithuanian crisis and to have assured Gorbachev that 
the United States is "not trying to make things difficult" for either side in 
the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, on his arrival in Washington on Tuesday, repeated that the 
Soviets want an "honest dialogue" with Lithuania on independence. 
</P>
<P>
He dodged a question about whether the Lithuanian crisis would interfere with 
the planned summit of Bush and Gorbachev. Shevardnadze will meet Bush on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official said the disclosure that East Germany, Czechoslovakia and 
Bulgaria had received SS-23 missiles from Moscow "will certainly be taken up by 
Baker with Shevardnadze." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have accused Moscow of violating the spirit, although not the 
letter, of a 1987 treaty that banned SS-23s and other medium-range missiles 
from the U.S. and Soviet arsenals by transferring the weapons to the three 
countries.

REP. SAVAGE PLAN TO CUT ISRAELI AID LOSES, 418-2 
</P>

<P>
The House Tuesday inflicted a humiliating defeat on Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.), 
who was recently accused of making anti-Semitic remarks, when he proposed 
eliminating funds for resettlement of Soviet Jews in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Savage suffered one of the most lopsided losses in House history as his 
colleagues rejected his amendment by a vote of 418 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a vote of confidence in Israel, it was a vote of overwhelming 
no-confidence in Gus," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.). Frank noted that all 
but one of Savage's fellow black congressmen voted against the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
One congressman urged that the House vote against the amendment not only 
because it was wrong, but because it was sponsored by Savage. 
</P>
<P>
As the votes mounted against him, Savage sat alone, occasionally smiling. He 
laughed when one of his chief defenders, Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), 
also voted against the amendment. In the end, only Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., 
a black Democrat from Detroit, voted with Savage. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.), who also is black, said the vote 
reflected only the unpopularity of the amendment, not of Savage. 
</P>
<P>
Three other amendments to cut foreign aid also were defeated overwhelmingly, 
but in each case the proponents got dozens of votes. Even Rep. James A. 
Trafficant Jr. (D-Ohio), a maverick who is frequently in a tiny minority, got 
72 votes for an amendment to cut the foreign aid programs by 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Savage met sharp criticism from many Democrats after he charged in a March 17 
speech that his major opponent in a primary election was backed largely by 
"Jewish money" given by people living outside the congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley and two high-ranking black lawmakers who endorsed 
Savage's reelection were among those who denounced those remarks. House 
Democratic Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania and Rep. Charles B. Rangel 
(D-N.Y.), who appeared at the campaign rally with Savage, said they left before 
he spoke but later called the remarks bigoted and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Savage accused the American Israel Public Affairs Committee of pouring money 
into his district to try to defeat him in what he termed an "un-American" 
tactic. He said that blacks cannot be racist and charged that he was a victim 
of a conspiracy by white-owned news media. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, floor managers for the emergency appropriations bill heaped scorn 
on Savage and his amendment to cut funds for Soviet Jews. Rep David R. Obey 
(D-Wis.), chief Democratic sponsor of the appropriations bill, urged rejection 
not only because of what the amendment would do, but also because Savage was 
its author. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare rebuff, Savage's colleagues also denied a roll call vote on a second 
amendment that would have knocked out $400 million in loan guarantees for 
housing for Jewish refugees in Israel. Savage protested that Israel, which 
receives about $3 billion in U.S. aid each year, was getting too much money at 
the expense of African countries and domestic programs to help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put the needs of America above the wants of Israel," Savage said in his 
lonely appeal. 
</P>
<P>
A thunderous chorus of no's, however, buried that proposal. Only Savage and 
Crockett rose to seek a roll call vote -- 98 short of the required 100 members. 
</P>
<P>
"Sit down! Sit down!" both Democrats and Republicans called out. 
</P>
<P>
Savage demanded a roll call anyway, on grounds that a quorum was not present. 
But the acting Speaker, Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), brusquely rejected the 
request, telling Savage there were enough members present to make a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated, Savage immediately walked off the floor and was not available for 
comment on the crushing defeat of his amendment.

A Superior Court judge said Tuesday that both sides in the Ramon Salcido mass 
murder case have tentatively agreed on moving his trial to Contra Costa, San 
Joaquin or San Mateo counties. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido is charged with the murders last April of his wife, Angela, 24; 
daughters, Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1; his mother-in-law, Marion Richards, 47; 
Richards' daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8; and his boss, Tracy Toovey, 35. 
</P>
<P>
He also is charged with attempting to kill another daughter, Carmina, 3, and 
fellow winery worker Ken Butti, 33. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Marteen Miller has successfully argued that intense publicity 
surrounding the case would make it impossible for Salcido, 38, to get a fair 
trial in Sonoma County.

3.9 EARTHQUAKE RATTLES LAKE ARROWHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3.9-magnitude earthquake shook the mountainous area around Lake Arrowhead 
Tuesday evening, apparently causing no serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech seismologists said the quake at 7:13 p.m. was centered six miles 
northeast of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Few residents of San Bernardino or other areas below Lake Arrowhead reported 
feeling the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one sharp jolt," said Stella Kerkvliet, manager of Jensen's Minute 
Shoppe in the village of Cedar Glen on the east side of the lake. "Then the 
liquor bottles started shaking, and they were ringing just like bells all in a 
row. But none of them fell off the shelves."

ANGRY COUNTY PRODS STATE ON FOSTER HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Stung by allegations that they have failed to protect foster children from 
abuse, Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday told their critics in state 
government: If they think they can monitor foster homes any better, they can 
take over the job. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors voted 3 to 2 to terminate the county's contract with the state to 
license and monitor foster homes, effective June 30, unless the state agrees to 
provide the county with more money. 
</P>
<P>
The action follows a scathing letter sent to county officials last month by 
Linda McMahon, director of state social services. It accused the county of 
repeatedly failing to promptly report deaths, abuse and overcrowded conditions 
in foster homes to state officials so that the homes could be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, McMahon alleged that county officials last July discovered 10 
children sleeping on the floor of a foster home garage and 10 more youngsters 
living in one upstairs bedroom. She charged that county officials waited five 
months to report the case to state officials for license revocation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the alleged poor performance by the county's Department of 
Children's Services, state officials also are considering terminating the 
$3.3-million-a-year contract that gives the county authority to license and 
monitor 3,800 foster homes housing more than 10,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chaffee, director of the county children's services department, told 
supervisors Tuesday that the state has not provided the county with enough 
money to adequately monitor foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have high expectations on one hand, and on the other hand, not fully 
fund the activities to achieve that," Chaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
He urged supervisors to "put the state on notice that if we can't come to terms 
on money . . . since it is your activity by law, you administer it." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee said the state should provide the county with another $1.7 million. He 
did not specify what the money would be used for. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, joined by Supervisor Ed Edelman in opposing 
termination of the contract, said, "I believe in home rule. Why should we 
transfer something to Sacramento when we should do the job?" 
</P>
<P>
Edelman set up a private meeting between Chaffee and McMahon on Tuesday 
afternoon in an effort to work out a compromise. Though none was reached, 
Edelman said, "They're talking." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Norris, public affairs director for the state Department of Social 
Services, said the department is prepared to take over licensing and monitoring 
of foster homes, but prefers to leave the job to the county. 
</P>
<P>
She expressed confidence that "whatever happens, the care of the children will 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
Norris said the state pays based on caseload figures provided by the county, 
and said she could not respond to the county's claim that it needs more money.

SAILOR GUILTY OF ASSAULT IN AIDS VIRUS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old San Diego sailor was convicted of aggravated assault in military 
court Tuesday for infecting a former Navy woman with AIDS-causing virus when 
they had sex and he neglected to tell her he was a carrier of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Although military personnel have been charged with aggravated assault in 
similar AIDS-virus transmission cases in the past, this is the first such case 
in military court where an individual was successfully prosecuted when he used 
a condom -- engaging in what has been considered a safe sex practice. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer John Joseph was sentenced to 30 months in jail, forfeiture of pay 
and a dishonorable discharge in the incident. The trial took place at the 32nd 
Street Naval station. Because of a pretrial agreement, however, Joseph will 
serve no more than six months in the brig, as long as he breaks no rules while 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"My life will never heal," said the 37-year-old San Diego resident who alleged 
that Joseph had infected her. The woman, a member of the Naval Reserve, said 
she was afraid for her future. "It's like somebody has a hatchet over my head, 
and I don't know when it's going to swing." 
</P>
<P>
In testimony, military doctors discussed whether Joseph could have infected the 
woman when both adults acknowledged that he did not ejaculate during 
intercourse. It is not yet known whether pre-ejaculate fluid contains human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Military doctors tried to 
evaluate the statistical odds of a woman becoming infected during a single 
sexual encounter with an infected man who used a condom. 
</P>
<P>
The case was further complicated by varying accounts of what had occurred on 
Jan. 22, 1989. The woman alleged they had used a condom and that it broke; 
Joseph testified that the condom did not break. She said the condom was dry; he 
said it contained nonoxynol 9, a chemical doctors believe may help reduce the 
spread of HIV. 
</P>
<P>
She testified that, in March, 1989, she had begun to feel poorly and called 
Joseph to find out if he had any contagious diseases that might have been 
transmitted. In this conversation, she alleged, he said that he felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, when she had her annual physical, the woman learned that 
she had tested positive for HIV. Stunned, she had a retest at another facility. 
Last July, she alleged, she told Joseph that she had tested positive; he still 
said nothing about his condition -- which had been identified more than a year 
earlier, in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very cruel. It's too ugly an act," said the woman in an interview. 
"If it were just gonorrhea, I could just get a shot. If I had known, I would 
never have gotten involved with him." She said she is considering suing Joseph 
in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS, or the HIV, is contracted through the exchange of bodily fluids that can 
occur from the use of intravenous drugs, blood transfusions or during sexual 
intercourse. In testimony, the woman swore that she had never used drugs or had 
a blood transfusion. She also said that she had not been sexually involved with 
anyone for at least a year before her involvement with Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
As a Naval reservist for eight years, she has been tested for AIDS every year 
since the Navy began testing. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the court-martial, Joseph, a 10-year enlistee who works on 
the Navy magazine All Hands, sobbed and said that he was sorry. "I never 
intended to hurt her," he said. "I am not a bad person." 
</P>
<P>
Asking Cmdr. Tim S. McClain, the presiding judge, to avoid acting out of "AIDS 
hysteria," Joseph's attorney, Lt. Marcella Auclair, said that her client, a 
caring man with an unsullied Naval record, did not deserve the assault charges 
because his crime was only that he didn't inform his sex partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Petty Officer Joseph was wrong not to have told her, and perhaps he was wrong 
for putting so much faith in condoms and the medical community," said Auclair. 
"He believed that if he used a condom with nonoxynol 9, it was safe." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Lt. Mark Newcomb painted a different picture of a man who risked a 
woman's life for "basic sexual pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He likened the episode to an individual pointing a gun at someone and pulling 
the trigger -- knowing that the safety is on. When the safety fails, it is 
still an aggravated assault, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are talking about with this aggravated assault is not a blow to the 
body, a maiming -- this is a death," Newcomb said. "Her life expectancy has 
been shortened dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first military case involving heterosexual AIDS-virus 
transmission in San Diego. Last year, a Navy medical corpsman was acquitted of 
sodomy and misconduct charges in connection with infecting another man. 
</P>
<P>
But experts say more and more AIDS-related cases are entering military courts. 
In three such cases that resulted in conviction, the charges were also assault. 
In most cases, however, an individual is charged with violating an order, since 
infected military personnel are ordered to inform their sex partners of their 
condition, as well as to use a condom. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force began issuing the order on a standardized form in late 1985; the 
Army began in February, 1986. The Navy, however, did not begin issuing the 
order until last year -- eliminating this possible avenue of prosecution for 
Joseph. Though Joseph received counseling about his condition and how to 
prevent virus transmission, he had never signed an order. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 2,069 active duty members of the armed forces who have tested 
positive for the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
According to a recent study, the military will pay $157,000 to $208,000 for 
care of each infected individual. Joseph, who was sentenced to a dishonorable 
discharge, will probably not qualify for military medical care, said Auclair. 
</P>
<P>
The court-martial also involved minor offenses, including Joseph's misuse of a 
Navy car and his pawning of two Navy cameras.

L.A. AGREES TO SHUT OWENS VALLEY PUMPS; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: THE DWP GIVES IN ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. THE DECISION MEANS A 
HISTORICALLY LOW WATER SUPPLY THIS YEAR AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
RATIONING. 
</P>

<P>
Under pressure from Owens Valley ranchers and Inyo County officials, the city 
of Los Angeles has agreed to stop pumping ground water from its Eastern Sierra 
Nevada properties, foreclosing for one year the opportunity to tap one of the 
city's three largest sources of water. 
</P>
<P>
The decision confirms Department of Water and Power projections that it would 
receive no water from that source this year, leading in part to a historically 
low supply of water and forcing the city to rely more heavily than ever on an 
already overburdened Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The MWD is projecting a 12% shortage in water supplies to its member agencies 
this year that officials hope will be made up by voluntary conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is facing its shortest water supply in more than a decade 
as a prolonged statewide drought has begun its fourth year. As a result, Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley is asking city residents to cut back water use by 10% 
or face rationing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing that happens in the fourth year of a drought," said 
John Stodder, an aide to Bradley on environmental matters. 
</P>
<P>
The decision comes amid ongoing negotiations with Inyo County officials over 
Los Angeles' future water rights in the area and is in response to the 
prolonged drought and the toll it has taken on the Owens Valley vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the water, but we cannot accept the future environmental impact of 
additional pumping" in the Owens Valley, said Rick Caruso, president of the 
DWP's Board of Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative agreement negotiated last year by the city and Inyo County bars Los 
Angeles from taking water if it would significantly damage the Owens Valley 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Inyo County water chief Greg James last week requested that exports of ground 
water to Los Angeles be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles basically agreed with us that ground water pumping should be 
limited . . . ," James said. "There really was no debate about it." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's latest reading of the Eastern Sierra snowpack watershed found that 
runoff into the Owens Valley area this spring will be about half of normal. 
Also, plant life on the valley floor has dried out from the drought, DWP 
assistant engineer Duane Buchholz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In normal years, Los Angeles gets about 60% of its water from the Owens Valley 
area. Most -- about 300,000 acre-feet a year -- flows down the Owens River into 
the Los Angeles aqueduct, but the most controversial issue is the 100,000 
acre-feet of water pumped from underground. 
</P>
<P>
Pumping by Los Angeles over the years has been blamed by Inyo residents for 
lowering the water level in private wells and killing vegetation, particularly 
the desert valley's few range trees. 
</P>
<P>
Inyo County and Los Angeles have battled in court over the pumping. After a 
five-year truce, the two sides agreed last year to a temporary settlement that 
would place strict limits on environmental damage caused by the Los Angeles 
pumping wells. Los Angeles could take no more water than nature replaces, and 
vegetation could no longer be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
But the tentative pact was so heavily attacked by Owens Valley ranchers and 
longtime residents that Inyo County officials asked for new concessions. 
Negotiators for Inyo and Los Angeles have been unable to agree on final 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed Monday, about 89,000 acre-feet of ground water will 
still be pumped this year, but it will all be used in Owens Valley for ranches, 
fish hatcheries and to repair past environmental damage. Last year, the city 
pumped 154,000 acre-feet from beneath Owens Valley, with about 62,000 acre-feet 
of it going to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not dramatically affect the DWP's already bleak projections 
for this year's water supply. Officials said they had earlier factored into 
their calculations the likelihood of having to eliminate that source of water 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Williams, the DWP engineer in charge of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, said 
the 70,000 to 100,000 acre-feet of ground water normally pumped from the Owens 
Valley -- enough to supply 140,000 to 200,000 households -- will be made up 
through continued pumping of water from the San Fernando Valley and through 
greater purchases from the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
"It leaves us in very rough shape for next year," said Caruso of continued 
pumping in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will also force the DWP to raise its requests for MWD water by 
25,000 acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
City purchases of MWD water have grown from about 10% of the total consumed in 
Los Angeles annually just a few years ago, to more than 60% of the projected 
demand this year. That has put an extra burden on MWD as that water agency is 
already feeling the effects of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Mayor Bradley has called on city residents to voluntarily cut 
water usage by 10%. He said last week it is likely that mandatory rationing 
will be implemented if the voluntarily effort falls short. Aides to the mayor 
said that the 10% cut will be measured against usage in 1986 -- the year the 
drought began and the first calls for voluntarily conservation went out.

BROOKINS HID OWNERSHIP OF BUILDING, REPORT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: THE BISHOP RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL RENOVATION LOAN BY USING A 
CHURCH CORPORATION, A CITY INVESTIGATOR CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
City investigators have found that on two separate occasions Bishop H. H. 
Brookins disguised his ownership of a run-down office complex to obtain 
controversial government renovation loans, according to a report that will be 
considered today by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in February that Brookins received an initial $238,000 loan 
of federal poverty funds in 1982 through a non-existent California church 
corporation that was listed as the building's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins then qualified for an additional $91,000 in loans by leading city 
officials to believe that the property was still owned by the church 
corporation, said George C. Hughley, chief of the Community Development 
Department's special investigations unit. 
</P>
<P>
But records show that a private company established by Brookins acquired the 
property in 1984 -- well before the new loans were issued in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another case of misrepresentation on the bishop's part," Hughley said in 
an interview Tuesday. "He misrepresented the whole situation to get roughly 
$90,000." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the original loan amount nor the additional $91,000 would have been 
approved if city officials had known that Brookins or a company he incorporated 
-- California Southway Development Corp. -- owned the property, Hughley said. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins, a longtime leader of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and 
political mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley, could not be reached for comment Tuesday 
at his Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop's attorney, J. Stanley Sanders, told the City Council's Community 
and Economic Development Committee last week that it is "far-fetched" to 
suggest that Brookins misrepresented his interest in the complex. Sanders also 
said there is no evidence that Brookins has personally benefited from his 
ownership of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council and the economic development committee are scheduled this 
morning to consider a proposal to recover about $48,000 that the city paid for 
rent in the Southwest Los Angeles office complex. Community Development 
Department reports have concluded that the money is owed to the city because 
Brookins had a conflict of interest in his dual role as a landlord who 
collected city rent for his Crenshaw property while serving as head of a 
10-year-old poverty program located in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hughley told the council committee there was "irrefutable evidence" 
that Brookins, not the church, had owned the building since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Frank Orozco said Tuesday that his office agrees that 
Brookins owned the property for the past 13 years and had a conflict of 
interest. The city attorney will recommend today that the council sue to 
recover the back rent, Orozco said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanders insisted that the property was purchased by the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in 1977, transferred to Southway in 1984 and first acquired by 
the bishop in 1988, according to a 29-page report submitted to the council last 
week on behalf of Brookins. Thus, Sanders said, Brookins had no conflict and 
does not owe the city a penny. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, Brookins and Southway would owe thousands of dollars in 
back property taxes because the property was not reassessed at a higher value 
when it changed hands in 1984 and 1988 as Sanders now contends, city officials 
said. Instead, the property value remains at the 1977 level because no change 
of owners was reported. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sanders) has either got to say that Brookins bought this property in 1977 
(and improperly obtained the city loans) . . . or he's got to say this whole 
thing was a (tax) scam," Hughley said in an interview. " . . . You cannot have 
it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders responded: "I disagree. I think we can have it both ways. We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
The three-story building housed the South Los Angeles Development Corp., a 
program headed by Brookins that offered job training and education for poor 
residents. A few years after the city issued the renovation loan to Brookins, 
the program moved from the renovated building to a dilapidated office next 
door. Brookins then leased the renovated offices for $10,000 a month to a 
private trade school. The program, meanwhile, has received more than $500,000 
in federal funds through the city while suffering from a long history of 
problems ranging from failure to pay taxes to theft of public funds, according 
to state and city reports. In February, the city canceled its $87,142-a-year 
contract with the poverty program. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Brookins personally owns the building, which loan records indicate is 
worth about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting accounts about how the building was acquired: Sanders 
said that the AME Church purchased the building in 1977 for $250,000 from Clark 
E. Parker, an insurance company executive and an acquaintance of the bishop. 
Parker told the district attorney's office that he donated the building to the 
church through Brookins, investigative reports show. And Brookins told 
investigators that he spent the $250,000 on building improvements and 
unspecified financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
The city investigation concluded that Brookins disguised his ownership of the 
building by placing it in the name of a non-existent organization, Southern 
California Conference AME Church Inc. The company was never registered with the 
California secretary of state, records show. 
</P>
<P>
By using the church organization, Brookins was able to receive the federally 
funded loan, Hughley said. 
</P>
<P>
The building was then acquired in 1984 by California Southway Development Corp. 
as part of a plan by Brookins to put together a group of investors willing to 
carry the building for tax benefits, Sanders said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Brookins went back to the city to apply for an additional 
$91,000 to finish the renovation, Hughley said. But when he applied for the new 
loan, Brookins submitted the owners as the AME church group, not Southway, 
Hughley said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughley suggested that the bishop did this for two reasons: The city would not 
have approved the loan to a private corporation held in Brookins' name, and the 
existing loan agreement required Brookins to repay the city if the church no 
longer owned the property. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a specific act," Hughley said. "It's obvious why he did it: To get 
some more money."

WOMAN REFUSES TO BE UPROOTED FROM HER HOUSE AFTER 42 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Mildred Heggen has lived in the same house in Thousand Oaks for 42 years. And 
she refuses to leave, even at the city's request. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks officials are asking the 81-year-old woman to sell her 
four-bedroom house to the city so it can widen adjoining Oakwood Drive and 
provide better access to a proposed civic auditorium in the city's 
multimillion-dollar Jungleland project, named after the wild-animal theme park 
that once occupied the site. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they offered Heggen $379,000 for her house. Heggen says the 
house, which her late husband built, would bring $500,000. But, she said, it is 
worth much more to her than money. 
</P>
<P>
And she -- along with her family and friends -- is fighting to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of memories here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, nearly 400 residents -- including county Supervisor 
Madge Schaefer -- signed petitions asking the city to leave Heggen alone. And 
on Friday, the woman's friends are planning a sit-in in the front yard of the 
house to protest the city's request. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ken Russell, a friend of Heggen's, the city could plan the road 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually stay low-key," Russell said. "But I don't think they have the right 
to come over and make this woman move for property they don't need." 
</P>
<P>
"It's madness," said James Nelson Brown, Heggen's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Mark G. Sellers said the city is sensitive to Heggen's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
He said officials want to meet with her Thursday to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there is a chance she may be able to stay," Sellers said. "We're just 
talking right now. I can't tell you the ultimate bottom line yet." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said officials are looking at alternate routes for the road. They are 
considering moving the house to another location. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city is encouraging Heggen to leave because her now quiet 
neighborhood will be completely transformed by the development. "It's going to 
be drastically changed," Sellers said. "It's a matter of realizing that." 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't matter, Heggen said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm through with it, I don't care what they do with it," Heggen said. "As 
long as I'm able to cope, I want to stay." 
</P>
<P>
In what Heggen views as an ironic twist, one city plan envisions bulldozing her 
house but leaving an old oak tree that stands outside her bedroom window. Such 
trees are protected by city law. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to keep the oak tree but throw me out," Heggen said. "What's 
more important?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, city officials say, the issue of moving Heggen has been blown out of 
proportion. They say they are not proceeding recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair," Sellers said of public reaction against the city. "All we're 
trying to do is open up the channels of communication." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ed Johnduff, the city's administrative services manager, the city 
has offered Heggen a fair market price for the house. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has hired a relocation agency to help Heggen move, if it 
comes to that. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said the city is not "around the corner with bulldozers" ready to tear 
down the house. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said she signed the petition because when she was on the City Council 
several years ago, it decided not to condemn land for the Jungleland project, 
which will include a new City Hall, hotel-office complex and civic auditorium 
on 20 acres near Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Conejo School Road. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was upset to learn that officials now want to condemn private 
property.

THIRD WOMAN IS STABBED TO DEATH IN CLAIREMONT; 
</P>
<P>

FLEEING, KNIFE-WIELDING KILLER.

<P>
An 18-year-old visitor from Michigan was stabbed to death in a Clairemont 
apartment Tuesday afternoon, fueling neighborhood fears that a serial killer 
may be stalking young women. 
</P>
<P>
A maintenance man confronted the assailant in the apartment where the slaying 
occurred, but the knife-wielding man got away. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified by the coroner's office late Tuesday as Holly Suzanne 
Tarr of Okemos, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, two other young neighborhood women were slain in much the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' age, appearance and manner of death were roughly the same in each 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the women was stabbed to death, and, yes, there are similarities," 
said Dorothy Powell, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Police Department. "But 
no, we don't have enough to say this is a series. We can't say it is, and we 
can't say it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gary Learn, the homicide detective heading up the investigation, responded 
with a terse "no comment" when asked about the serial-killer theory. 
</P>
<P>
A woman visiting a friend who lives directly below the apartment where 
Tuesday's slaying occurred told police that the victim had arrived in San Diego 
from Michigan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, in an interview with a detective, said that Tarr and a woman friend 
arrived together and were staying at the apartment of the victim's brother. 
</P>
<P>
The victim and her friend had spent the warm morning by the apartment complex's 
pool. At some point, Tarr walked upstairs toward the apartment with a man, the 
visitor to the downstairs apartment told police. The man's identity is unknown. 
The victim's friend stayed by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"A little while later, my friend heard a terrible scream and heard the girl 
fall. My friend went upstairs and saw the girl bleeding profusely," the visitor 
to the downstairs apartment told police, adding that Tarr's friend dashed to 
the apartment and stood outside, crying uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood residents are convinced that the killings are the work of the same 
person. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think one person did all three, and it's very scary," said Pat Dorr, a 
19-year-old tenant who lives nearby. "I did like living here, but now, I'm 
moving out." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Richards, who lives across the alley from where Tuesday's slaying occurred, 
said, "I don't like it one bit. I'm very scared. If there's a serial killer 
loose in my neighborhood, I think it's time I left." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilmen Bruce Henderson, whose district includes the neighborhood, 
concluded Tuesday, after taking a personal interest in the first two cases, 
that all three may be the work of a single killer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sounding more and more like it's one person perpetrating this," Henderson 
said. "But our greatest danger is to think it's only one person. It could be 
two. The first murder could be unrelated from the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference this time, though, is that a suspect of at least one of the 
crimes has been identified. And we have our fingers crossed that, with the 
person being interrupted, he will have left enough fingerprints to allow the 
police to capture him." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Williams, 58, a maintenance man who works at the sprawling Buena Vista 
Gardens apartment complex, said he was paged by the rental office to respond to 
"a problem" at the one-bedroom unit in the 3400 block of Cowley Way about 12:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he found the door to the upstairs unit chained and locked. 
Hearing a woman's screams, he forced the door open and bolted inside. He said 
that, shortly after entering, he was confronted by a man, about 5-foot-8, 
"maybe 17 or 18," who wore over his head what appeared to be a pillowcase. The 
assailant went after Williams with a raised knife. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a dagger," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he fell backwards, bruising and cutting his temple. At this, the 
assailant fled the apartment. Williams said he then went to the bedroom, where 
he found the victim. She was nude and lying on the floor holding a 
blood-drenched towel to her body. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she would live," Williams said. "I was surprised to hear she had 
died. She was looking around and seemed pretty alert." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he made no attempt to talk to the woman but instead rushed to the 
kitchen to telephone police. He said he called 911 and, within three minutes, 
paramedics and police were at the door. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, the San Diego Police Department was searching for a suspect that 
spokeswoman Powell described as a black male, 18 years old; 5 feet, 8 inches 
tall; thin to medium build and short-cropped hair. He was last seen wearing a 
red T-shirt and black Levi's, running west on Dakota Drive at Clairemont Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said anyone with information about the suspect is asked to call 531-2293 
or 235-TIPS. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said several people got a good look at the suspect. A young male 
tenant, who saw the assailant flee, gave chase into a canyon that overlooks 
Cowley Way. Police detectives said they found a red T-shirt but no other trace 
of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Maidhof, who works for Buena Vista Gardens demolishing the interiors of 
units earmarked for refurbishing, said several people saw the suspect run 
toward the complex's swimming pool, in the 3200 block of Cowley Way, sometime 
after the slaying occurred. 
</P>
<P>
He said the suspect ran toward a fenced area in the 3200 block and disappeared 
into an alley before he drove off in a gray, "primer-paint-colored" Pinto 
sedan. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's slaying was the third to have happened within a two-block area since 
Jan. 12, when the body of Tiffany Paige Schultz, a 20-year-old student at San 
Diego State University, was discovered in her apartment in the 3100 block of 
Cowley Way. Police said Schultz was the victim of "multiple stab wounds." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 16, the body of 21-year-old Janene Marie Weinhold, a student at UC San 
Diego, was discovered in her apartment in the 3300 block of Clairemont Drive. 
Police have been more reticent in discussing Weinhold's death and virtually 
noncommittal in responding to possible parallels between her death and 
Schultz's, but they have said that Weinhold was the victim of "stab wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Like Tuesday's victim, Weinhold was a tenant at Buena Vista Gardens, which is 
described in the Greater San Diego Apartment Guide as offering "a suburban 
lifestyle that is minutes away." The guide lists rents at Buena Vista Gardens 
as ranging between $545 for a one-bedroom, one-bath, and $640 for a 
two-bedroom, one-bath. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz was a tenant at Canyon Ridge, which is next door to Buena Vista Gardens 
but is managed by the same firm, Anza Management Co. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, tenants have complained of an increasing transient population 
in the area and more drug use. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent neighborhood meeting, called by tenants of Buena Vista Gardens to 
air security concerns, Jim Watkins, a public affairs officer for the San Diego 
Police Department, said the Clairemont neighborhood where the slayings occurred 
is infamous as a crystal methamphetamine manufacturing center. He said drug 
activity and burglaries in the area have risen dramatically in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, whose district includes the neighborhood where the women died, said 
he was told Tuesday by Police Chief Bob Burgreen that the department is making 
the investigation a "No. 1 priority . . . . They're pulling out all the stops. 
They're going to bring to bear everything they've got to try to find this 
person." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting called Tuesday night by police to calm jittery residents, 
frustrated tenants were left with a host of unanswered questions by officers. 
Powell and Officer Jim Watkins advised residents on ways to defend themselves 
but could not provide details about any of the murders in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents wanted to know if the killer or killers had broken into the 
homes of the three dead women and the motive in each murder. Powell and Watkins 
said they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know how he got in . . . and I'm not getting any information from 
you," said a frustrated woman. 
</P>
<P>
Powell and Watkins told the crowd that extra detectives and police have been 
assigned to investigate the latest killing and that solving the three slayings 
is a priority of the department. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. Now tell us what you're doing to solve these crimes," yelled one man. 
</P>
<P>
After Weinhold's slaying in mid-February, Henderson said he was told by police 
that hers differed enough from Schultz's that police concluded they were not 
the work of a the same killer. Shortly after Schultz's body was found with more 
than 50 stab wounds, Christopher Jon Burns, a 28-year-old construction worker 
who was engaged to Schultz, was arrested and held for five days in County Jail. 
Burns has not been rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who lived with Schultz at the time of her death, said Tuesday that he is 
"stunned" by the latest death. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not vindicated until it's solved, and right now, the police are not 
saying that any of the murders are related," Burns said. "I was really upset to 
hear about this. It's like I go through the same thing over and over again."

GRAND JURY CALLS DRUG BABIES A GROWING BURDEN; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT: PANEL FINDS COUNTY UNPREPARED FOR THE LONG-TERM NEEDS OF INFANTS BORN 
TO ADDICTED MOTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 8,000 babies born each year in San Diego County are being exposed to 
drugs or alcohol while in the womb, according to a report issued Tuesday by the 
San Diego County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
In half of those cases, the mother's drug use is severe enough that babies 
usually test positive for drugs immediately after birth, said Peggy Peelle, 
chairwoman of the grand jury committee that compiled the report on children who 
are damaged by drugs and alcohol during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prompted by a growing wave of drug babies that is "overburdening 
our resources," Grand Jury Foreman J. Phil Franklin said Tuesday. "We are not 
prepared . . . for the special long-term needs" of babies who are damaged when 
their mothers abuse drugs and alcohol, Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal care for physically and neurologically damaged infants costs an 
estimated $28,000 per infant, and therapy to prepare them for kindergarten 
costs an additional $40,000, said Peelle, a retired pediatrician. Withdrawal 
symptoms for drug-addicted babies may last for months, making it difficult and 
expensive to care for the infants, according to Peelle. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug Abuse Through the Umbilical Cord," a 35-page report that the grand jury 
issued following seven months of study, includes 25 recommendations for six 
countywide agencies charged with public health and law enforcement. Franklin 
and Peelle maintained that the report would not be "back-burnered" by county 
supervisors, who already have pledged to bolster programs to address the 
growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
Among the grand jury's recommendations were: 
</P>
<P>
* The creation of drug treatment centers that would cater to pregnant women and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased education aimed at reducing illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
* Mandatory drug treatment programs for women who give birth to drug-addicted 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
* Mandatory drug testing for pregnant women known to be at high risk for 
substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
* Encouragement for obstetricians to conduct prenatal drug testing on pregnant 
women, a move that could help to cut the number of babies born with physical 
and neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures in the report, methamphetamine is the "primary drug of 
abuse" among pregnant San Diego women who choose to do drugs. Cocaine is the 
second most common drug of choice, followed by heroin. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 study of 463 drug-exposed babies showed that the median age of their 
drug-abusing mothers was 26, leading researchers to state that "the women 
reflected in this study are not our teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
That study also showed that methamphetamine was the drug of choice in 51% of 
the cases where babies tested positive for drugs. Cocaine accounted for 29% of 
the cases and heroin for 11%. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of pregnant white women whose babies were exposed to illegal drugs 
prefer to use methamphetamine, according to the report, while more than 80% of 
black pregnant women whose babies were exposed to illegal drugs prefer crack 
cocaine. About half of the pregnant Latino women who use illegal drugs prefer 
methamphetamine, the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury report paid special attention to the growing number of mothers 
who deliver more than one drug-exposed infant. Statistics from one local 
hospital, which was unidentified, suggested that the "average mother whose 
addicted infant was in the intensive care nursery had previously given birth to 
a drug-exposed infant." The report also cited the case of one Los Angeles-area 
woman who has given birth to seven drug-exposed babies. 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts are most concerned about the 4,000 babies each year who are 
classified as "positive tox" babies, infants who at birth test positive for 
methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, PCP, alcohol or other drugs, Peelle said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all local hospitals test mothers or babies for drugs, but an estimated 11% 
of babies born nationally are believed to be positive tox babies. During 1988, 
hospitals reported 1,000 positive tox babies to the county's department of 
Child Protective Services. 
</P>
<P>
Drug-exposed infants are more likely to be born prematurely, or to be born 
"growth-retarded," further increasing the risk of death or disability, 
according to the report. The grand jury report cited a study by a local 
hospital, again unidentified, which found that 39% of full-term infants who 
tested positive for drugs had brain abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego hospitals also are struggling with another expensive byproduct of 
increased drug use by mothers, the so-called "boarder babies" who are abandoned 
at the hospital by mothers. One unnamed local hospital recently held an 
abandoned baby for a 245-day stay that cost $250,000, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of drug-exposed babies, including many who are abandoned, 
have AIDS or venereal diseases, making placement in foster homes difficult, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's foster homes generally have been able to absorb the growing number 
of babies that are either abandoned or taken from their parents, according to 
the report. But, "as our foster homes become saturated and the incidence of 
venereal diseases and AIDS increases, we will probably be faced" with a 
shortage, according to the grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, nearly 60% of babies identified as having been exposed to 
drugs were sent to foster homes, usually because the parents were unfit to 
raise the children. After one year, 30% remained in foster homes, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 40 new positive tox babies now are entering the foster care system 
each month. The county recently hired a recruiter to find and train families 
who can provide special care demanded by drug and alcohol-damaged infants. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of pregnant mothers has increased rapidly in recent years, 
"San Diego County did not have any comprehensive day treatment programs to meet 
the special needs of pregnant or parenting women," the grand jury report said. 
</P>
<P>
Of 121 residential beds available for treatment of woman alcoholics, just 12 
beds were reserved for women with children. Similarly, of 34 beds funded by 
drug abuse services for addicted women, just six were reserved for addicts' 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The county also is struggling to address the growing number of women who never 
see a doctor during pregnancy. The county now has the highest "no care" 
delivery rate in California, largely because only 20% of the county's 
obstetricians will accept Medi-Cal patients. Medi-Cal is seen as an undesirable 
service because it offers relatively low payments and a lot of paper work and 
bureaucracy.

CABDRIVERS' FREEDOM OF FASHION STILL UNRESTRICTED; 
</P>
<P>
CLOTHES: UNLIKE LOS ANGELES' TAXI DRIVERS, NOBODY TELLS VENTURA COUNTY'S 
CABBIES HOW TO DRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ship his fingerprints to Sacramento. Inspect his driver's license. Scrutinize 
his meters if you must. But don't tell Ken Cornelius he can't wear Bermuda 
shorts and Birkenstock sandals as he pilots one of two taxicabs in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"That's blasphemy," Cornelius said Tuesday. "Don't go calling the Ojai City 
Council and giving them ideas." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the City Council is enforcing a strict dress code for 
cabdrivers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the provisions: no shorts, no sweat suits, no untucked shirts, no bare 
feet or open-toed footwear, no leisure suits and no skirts shorter than 
knee-length for women drivers. The potential fine for drivers who violate the 
code is $500. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, meanwhile, about three dozen cabbies continue to prowl the 
highways and byways in essentially unrestricted fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no dress code for cabdrivers," said Ventura police Service Officer 
Rick French. "But they aren't allowed to use each other's jokes. We have an 
ordinance for that." He was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
A spot check of city codes in Ventura, Oxnard and Ojai disclosed no dress code 
provisions for taxi drivers. 
</P>
<P>
And a spot check of county cabbies disclosed Cornelius' toes, peeking out from 
the worn leather of his size 11 Birkenstock sandals, and the untucked shirt of 
Joey Avila, last seen in a Gold Coast cab at the Oxnard Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got your shirt tucked in, and you get out of your cab more than 
three times, it's not going to be tucked in," Avila said. "You've got to be 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Avila, a driver for two years, wore, with his untucked white shirt, sneakers 
and a pair of slightly rumpled blue slacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I got up this morning real quick," he said, "so my old lady didn't have time 
to iron." 
</P>
<P>
All this does not mean that the clothing of a Ventura County cabbie is entirely 
ungoverned. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask them to come up in clean, neat clothes, to look professional if they 
can," said Marty Datwyler, who runs the nine-car Yellow Cab of Ventura with her 
husband, John. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had never fired a driver for his dressing habits. But about a year 
ago, she said, a driver came to work in Bermuda shorts and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like he was going to the beach. So we asked him to go home and 
change . . . I think we've got things in hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I require dark pants and white shirts," said Red Hardin, operator of the 
15-vehicle Yellow Cab of Oxnard. "If they complain, I just don't put them on 
the road. Very seldom does anyone say anything." 
</P>
<P>
And Joey Avila said that Gold Coast Cab requires white shirts and slacks, and 
that ties are not an uncommon sight on weekends, when well-heeled visitors 
arrive in need of transport to pricey hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves just one question: Is Ventura County even remotely close to 
imposing any fashion rules on its taxi drivers? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd probably insist on the public voting on it," Cornelius said. "I like being 
comfortable." 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY TO DOUBLE PERMIT FEES FOR FILMMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to more 
than double permit fees charged to Hollywood filmmakers, despite concern from 
industry officials that the increase might drive them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
County Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon recommended that the fees 
production companies pay to film in unincorporated areas and three independent 
cities be raised from $110 per day to $200, effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The fees will increase to $220, plus an adjustment based on the consumer price 
index, in January, 1991, and will rise an additional $20 plus an index 
adjustment in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon had initially proposed increasing the fees to $310 per day to offset the 
cost of running the county's film permit office. But after film industry 
officials protested, the supervisors ordered county officials to negotiate with 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dixon said the fee increase approved by the supervisors was a 
compromise, several industry officials testified against the increase and 
expressed concern that it would drive filmmakers to cheaper jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the increase, the board voted to transfer management of the film 
permit office from the county to the Economic Development Corp., a private 
nonprofit group.

PROSECUTORS WON'T SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR BRODERICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors said Tuesday that, partly out of consideration for her four 
children, they will not seek the death penalty for Elisabeth Anne (Betty) 
Broderick of La Jolla, who is accused of killing her ex-husband and his new 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said that San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin 
Miller's decision hinged in part upon the fact that all four Broderick children 
-- Kimberly, 20; Lee, 18; Danny, 14, and Rhett, 11 -- will probably be 
witnesses in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There are four children that were pretty horribly traumatized by the events in 
this case," Wells said shortly after Broderick, 42, was arraigned on two counts 
of murder in San Diego Superior Court. "They've already gone through a lot. 
They've lost their father. They've lost their stepmother, and I think it just 
seemed that putting them in the position of having to play a part in perhaps 
losing their mother to the gas chamber is just too much." 
</P>
<P>
Jack M. Earley, Broderick's attorney, said he and his client had expected the 
announcement but she was not overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you could ever ask someone to be relieved if they're facing life 
without possibility of parole," he said. "That's not something that any of us 
would jump for joy to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick is accused of shooting Daniel T. Broderick III, 44, and his 
28-year-old wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, early on the morning hours of Nov. 
5. On Tuesday, she renewed her not-guilty pleas and denied the prosecution's 
claim that there are special circumstances in the case. A trial date will be 
set Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Earley shed some light on his strategy. He said he has not 
ruled out an insanity defense but his immediate focus will be moving the trial 
out of San Diego, where Broderick says she cannot get a fair trial because her 
ex-husband was a prominent malpractice attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick has admitted the killings, but Earley said he will attempt to paint a 
portrait of how his client got "to the point that she got to" -- a process that 
will rely heavily on the testimony of lawyers and judges who were involved in 
the Brodericks' protracted divorce. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Earley said, he has serious doubts that the case could be 
tried in San Diego without the appearance of impropriety. He said he will 
"definitely" seek a change of venue and plans to file motions to recuse 
specific judges and the bench as a whole if need be. "It's going to be very 
hard for any judge in San Diego to make impartial rulings as to whether a judge 
should be a witness in this case," Earley said. "It's going to be very 
difficult to have a jury trial where one of the issues might be the conduct of 
the bench and how they treat attorneys who are involved in litigation versus a 
private citizen." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "If we attack the judicial system in San Diego and talk about the 
way that it treats different genders, men versus women, that judge who we are 
saying doesn't treat women fairly is going to be the judge that's sitting 
before that jury. So it just creates the appearance of impropriety."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS REJECT AMMUNITION SALE CURB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed ban on the sale of ammunition in unincorporated territory the week 
before New Year's Eve and July 4 was rejected Tuesday by a 3-2 vote of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was proposed by Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and supported by Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block in an effort to deter holiday 
revelers from firing guns into the air. 
</P>
<P>
But the board's three-man conservative majority opposed the measure, claiming 
that it would be difficult to enforce. Hahn's liberal colleague Ed Edelman 
supported the ordinance. A similar ordinance is under consideration by the Los 
Angeles City Council.

LINDA VISTA SCHOOL GETS $550,555 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Vista Elementary School in San Diego will receive $550,555 as one of 15 
schools in eight states awarded major grants by the RJR Nabisco Foundation to 
help improve education in America. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego school board invited Linda Vista teachers to make a presentation 
to trustees later this month on their plans to spend the money, which is the 
largest private grant to a single school in the district's history. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Vista, with a heavily Indochinese and Latino student population, has 
implemented its own academic program that emphasizes English language study and 
native-language instruction in basic subjects in the morning, followed by 
afternoon enrichment in art or music.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2ND MCMARTIN TRIAL TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second trial of McMartin Pre-School molestation defendant Ray Buckey will 
begin next week as planned, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, who was acquitted of 40 charges of child molestation last January, 
still faces eight counts of sexually abusing three girls who attended his 
family's Manhattan Beach school. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had postponed the start of jury selection for two weeks, until 
Monday, because Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, was suffering back problems. 
Davis had asked for a continuance of several months to undergo surgery, but a 
second expert who examined him at the court's request said that rest, physical 
therapy and a mild pain-killer probably would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last six months.

Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and the treasurer of a California Young

Political Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent was fined by the Fair Political Practices Commissions for eight 
campaign disclosure violations in an April, 1987, election. Vincent earlier had 
agreed to to the settlement arrangement with the FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
The other $16,000 fine involved eight campaign reporting violations against the 
California Young Republicans Political Action Committee and its treasurer, 
Daniel Dellicompagni of Huntington Beach. The FPPC said the organization failed 
to file six semi-annual campaign statements and two pre-election campaign 
statements by the deadlines in the last four years.

BEILENSON SEEKS $6 MILLION FOR WATERWAY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to revitalize the Los Angeles River and expand recreational facilities 
in the Sepulveda Basin, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) will make his 
case for $6 million in proposed federal funding before a congressional panel 
today. 
</P>
<P>
If Beilenson's visions of a greener San Fernando Valley are to become reality, 
however, they must first survive stiff competition for money in the tight 
federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson will ask for $1 million to study the river's recreational, 
transportation and water conservation potential. He is acting at the behest of 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who hopes to transform the waterway -- used 
primarily for flood control for decades -- into a greenbelt featuring bike 
paths and riding trails. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Beilenson will request $5 million for additional landscaping, 
trails and open space in the Sepulveda Basin, which has been called the 
Valley's Central Park. The proposal includes $3 million to create parkland from 
80 acres at Burbank Boulevard and Woodley Avenue, now leased for sod farming. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson, whose 23rd District includes the West Valley, plans to present the 
financing proposals to the energy and water development subcommittee of the 
House Appropriations Committee at its annual "California Day" hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
During this Capitol Hill rite of spring, the subcommittee sets aside several 
hours to hear from California lawmakers as well as representatives of state 
agencies and the public about proposed flood control, navigation, harbor, 
irrigation and water supply projects. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will decide which specific proposals from California and other states 
will be included in the national Energy and Water Development bill for the 
1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
A senior subcommittee staffer said that because of next year's extremely tight 
federal budget, projects now receiving funding are far more likely to be 
financed than new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision-making process involves more than simply following certain 
guidelines," said a Beilenson aide familiar with the process. "There's a lot of 
politics, and there's a lot of subjective judgments involved about which 
projects will be funded and which won't. At this stage, there are just too many 
unknowns to predict whether our efforts will be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's initiative, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains 
part of the flood control channel, would conduct an 18-month study of various 
proposals to enhance public use of the river. They include establishing bicycle 
paths, improving existing flood controls and removing concrete paving along the 
riverbed to create a more natural river environment. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal to be studied calls for water treated by two sewage plants 
along the river to be diverted into a cleared area and permitted to seep into 
the soil, recharging the ground water tables. The treated water now flows into 
the river and out to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The river begins in the southwest Valley and flows east along the northern base 
of the Santa Monica Mountains and past downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's plan represents only one of several competing visions for the river, 
which has experienced a recent renaissance in public awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda) wants to build a three-lane freeway in 
the riverbed. The Los Angeles County Transportation Committee has set aside 
$100,000 to study Katz's initiative, which would integrate the roadway with 
parks, businesses and housing along the river banks. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers, meanwhile, is studying a proposal to spend about 
$250 million to raise the river's flood control levees, which are between 20 
and 25 feet high, by several feet. 
</P>
<P>
And state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) is pursuing a plan similar to 
Bradley's. Torres persuaded a Senate committee last week to earmark $200,000 
for the Coastal Conservancy to prepare a master plan to turn the river into a 
park and recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the 2,150-acre Sepulveda Basin is leased by the Corps to the city of 
Los Angeles for recreational purposes. In the mid-1980s, Congress appropriated 
$10 million, which the city matched, to develop 160 acres as a park and 60 
acres as a wildlife reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Balboa Park, built around a 26-acre fishing and boating lake, will be open 
to the public later this year. The wildlife area was completed and opened 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 million sought for next year would include $1 million for traffic 
barriers and additional landscaping at Lake Balboa Park; $1 million for trails, 
terracing and plantings to enhance the creek that runs through the basin; and 
$3 million for landscaping, parking, picnic tables and restrooms at the 80 
acres now leased for agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
The city, in turn, would put up a matching $5 million for construction of the 
park's water supply system and would assume the expenses of operating and 
maintaining the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Green space and outdoor recreation areas are scarce in the San Fernando 
Valley," Beilenson said in testimony prepared for delivery today. "These parks 
will go a long way toward meeting the recreation needs of the 1 1/2 million 
Valley residents."

SCHOOLS MAY MAKE PARENTS SIGN CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Parents of Oxnard Union High School District students may soon be asked to 
promise to send their children to school properly washed, dressed and fed in a 
move officials hope will enlist parental support for quality education. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees will consider today whether to take the unusual step of 
asking parents to sign a contract pledging to take an active interest in their 
children's education. 
</P>
<P>
The contract in part asks that "parents should send their children to school 
properly washed, dressed, fed, rested, in good health and with a positive 
attitude towards the schools." 
</P>
<P>
While the tasks outlined in the contract may seem routine to some, school 
officials say some parents need to be reminded of basic responsibilities toward 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's absolutely essential," Supt. Bob Carter said. "Far too many times 
we have really done nothing more for parents than give them some handy tips. We 
feel it's high time to say to the parents of children in our district, 'There 
are certain things we expect from you.' " 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the trustees, the two-page contract will be sent home to parents 
next fall in their children's registration packets. Parent Teacher Student 
Assns. will hand out posters and brochures urging families to make sure that 
children attend school regularly, arrive on time and make up missed schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
Unique in the county, the contract is similar to dress codes adopted by school 
districts statewide, said Hueneme High School Principal Terry Taylor, who wrote 
the Home-School Partnership, as the contract is called, with Alice Johnson, 
principal of Frontier High School in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 students are enrolled in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was written at the request of groups alarmed by the low number of 
parents who turn up for teacher conferences and school events, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"While we don't expect 100% response, it will certainly raise the awareness of 
adults in the community that we are an integral part of our children's 
education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Board members expressed hopes that the proposed contract will remind parents to 
pay more attention to their children. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, we see the parent does not do his or her part to make sure 
their kids are dressed and to school on time. I'd say about 50% of parents 
don't feel that responsibility to their child," board member Bedford Pinkard 
said. "We hope this will remind parents to do the basic things." 
</P>
<P>
The trustees will meet at 7 p.m., in the district office, 309 S. K St., Oxnard.

GLESS FAN PLANNED SUICIDE, POLICE SAY; 
</P>
<P>
OBSESSION: AN ORANGE COUNTY WOMAN ACCUSED OF BREAKING INTO THE ACTRESS'S HOUSE 
HAD 500 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An obsessed fan who barricaded herself inside a Studio City house owned by 
actress Sharon Gless was armed with 500 rounds of ammunition and intended to 
sexually assault the actress before committing suicide, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, authorities said, during a burglary of the same residence a week 
before the standoff, Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Santa Ana allegedly stole an 
address book in hopes of tracking down Gless at her Malibu home. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police Detective Chuck Hart said the book, which police discovered 
during a search of Penn's car on Friday, did not contain the actress's address. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said that Penn admitted during an interview after her arrest that she 
planned to use the book to find Gless. 
</P>
<P>
Penn pleaded not guilty Tuesday to two counts of burglary at her arraignment in 
San Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson, saying that Penn posed a danger to the 
community, denied bail. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had sought bail of $1 million because of the large amount of 
ammunition and because, they said, Penn's letters were becoming increasingly 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
More than 120 letters were sent, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn surrendered to police after a seven-hour standoff Friday inside the 
unoccupied house, which Gless used as an office. 
</P>
<P>
Penn had been under court orders not to harass the former star of the "Cagney 
and Lacey" television series. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, a theater student at Golden West College in Huntington Beach, threatened 
to commit suicide and locked herself in a bathroom while police negotiators 
tried to persuade her to surrender, police said. 
</P>
<P>
She was armed with a loaded .22-caliber AT-22 semiautomatic rifle that she had 
bought from an Orange County sporting goods store three to four months earlier, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn continued to write to Gless after the restraining order was issued in 
November, 1988, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one of the letters, Penn said she would violate the order to be 
near the actress, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Myron L. Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on both counts, Penn could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years 
in prison, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The restraining order told Penn to remain at least 1,000 yards from the actress 
and her immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
Gless sought the order after receiving a letter from Penn's Santa Ana 
psychiatrist that stated, "Although this patient has no destructive intent 
toward you, she did plan to shoot herself in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Richard J. Salas, who represented Penn during her brief 
arraignment, said his client did not pose a threat to the community and should 
be granted bail. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the celebrity status of the victim is what caused her to get that high 
bail," Salas said. "This woman has no type violence in her background. She has 
never attempted to do anything violent to Ms. Gless."

LOCAL ELECTIONS LA PUENTE CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
PERENNIAL INCUMBENTS, APATHY REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Mayor Max E. Ragland how long he's been on the La Puente City Council, and 
he has to pause to do some simple arithmetic with a paper and pencil. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-four years," he says with some surprise. 
</P>
<P>
And how many times have his fellow councilmen elected him mayor? "I don't know. 
It's funny, I haven't kept track of that," he says. "I've been mayor, I think, 
five times. . . . I've also been vice-mayor several times, but I don't know how 
many." 
</P>
<P>
Ragland, 70, can be forgiven his confusion. After all, he and the two other 
incumbents running for reelection Tuesday have been on the council for a 
combined total of 60 years. Among Los Angeles County's 86 municipalities, the 
La Puente City Council may be the most experienced and deeply entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
Every other year, with rare exceptions, La Puente voters have elected the same 
group of men to office. No outside challenger has unseated a councilman in 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
First elected in 1958, Ragland is running for his seventh four-year term on the 
five-member council. Francis (Frank) Palacio, 62, also is seeking his seventh 
term. Louis Guzman, 70, is going for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
Another councilman, Charles Storing, 62, has served on the body since 1960. One 
of the challengers in this year's election hadn't even been born when Ragland, 
Palacio and Storing first took office. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente's experience is not uncommon among the smaller cities in Los Angeles 
County. In most April elections, incumbents win about 70% of the contests, 
records indicate. Each year a handful of the 40 or so cities holding April 
elections have them canceled because of a lack of challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Even in this company, however, La Puente stands out. This year's "campaign" has 
not included a single candidate forum or rally. Council members and challengers 
agree that community response to the election can be summarized in one word: 
apathy. 
</P>
<P>
If next month's election follows patterns of the past, about 10% of the 
registered voters in this city of 33,000 will cast ballots. In previous 
elections, candidates have been elected with as few as 600 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a small group of people who vote all the time and that group votes in 
the same people," said Louis Perez, 52, a two-time loser in the council race. 
In his first two campaigns, Perez lost by 93 and 257 votes. 
</P>
<P>
To get an edge this time, Perez is registering new voters. "Everybody says that 
it's time for a change, for some new blood," said Perez. "Well, if you want 
some new blood, you need to get some new voters." 
</P>
<P>
Guzman said he, too, is "disturbed" by the low voter turnout. In the past 
campaigns, he said, "When we've had candidate forums, more candidates would 
show up than voters." 
</P>
<P>
For the perpetually elected councilmen, the twice-monthly council meetings long 
ago became routine. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Councilman Palacio has attended about 550 meetings. Collectively, the 
current council has more than 2,000 meetings under its belt. Palacio, Ragland 
and Storing have each voted on an estimated 4,000 agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
With consensus being the rule, the vast majority of those items have ended with 
5-0 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped fighting a long time ago," Palacio said of the council. "Why should 
we make a lot of noise and get our city in the paper?" 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the long-serving councilmen say they have been consistently 
reelected because they are doing a good job of running the city. As proof, they 
point to the city's $16.7 million cash reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than allow the city's savings to grow, the five challengers say some of 
La Puente's surplus money should be spent on badly needed social reform. They 
say much has changed in La Puente since Ragland was first elected to the 
council in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, walnut and orange groves surrounded the 3.5-square-mile city. The 
nearby Pomona Freeway was only a dotted line on an urban planner's map and the 
phrase "drive-by shooting" had yet to enter the local vocabulary. Downtown La 
Puente was a small, but thriving commercial center, with families patronizing 
the Star Theater, a movie house complete with a "crying room" for infants. 
</P>
<P>
The Star Theater now shows X-rated films. Last week, the marquee promised 
patrons an "Interlude of Lust." Since the halcyon days of the 1950s, gang- and 
drug-related crime have tarnished La Puente's image as a quiet bedroom 
community -- crack dealers can be seen operating openly just a mile down Main 
Street from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done, these issues need to be addressed," said candidate 
Manuel Garcia, 52, a member of the city Planning Commission who is taking a 
second shot at a council seat. "I don't think the council is doing anything 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
The main shopping district along Hacienda Boulevard has suffered a series of 
major blows in the past year. First, the Gemco department store closed -- sales 
and property taxes from the store were the city's largest source of revenue. A 
Jeep and a Ford car dealership also have left the city, moving to greener 
pastures in the neighboring City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente has fallen on tough times, the three incumbents concede. Guzman said 
La Puente, like other suburban cities, is finding it difficult to fight the 
drug epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll chase (the drug dealers) from here, and then they'll go someplace else," 
Guzman said. "It's like the Medfly problem. It won't go away." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's economic and social problems, the challengers face an uphill 
battle. Not since 1968 has an incumbent lost his seat to an outside challenger. 
New council members have only been elected when councilmen have retired or 
died. 
</P>
<P>
The newest member of the council, Joe Alderete, was elected in 1986 when 
four-term councilman Allen T. Lefever retired. Mayor Ragland left the council 
in 1974 for a seat on the Planning Commission, but was reappointed in 1983 when 
three-term councilman Allen J. Martin died. 
</P>
<P>
The last outsider to defeat a city councilman was former state Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya, who was recently convicted in a corruption scandal. And even Montoya 
didn't win his council seat on the first ballot. Montoya finished the 1968 
election in a tie with Councilman Storing. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio recalled that the two candidates refused to pay for a recount to break 
the tie. State regulations stipulated that the race should then be decided by a 
coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't like that idea very much," Palacio remembered. So the councilmen 
decided to recount the ballots themselves. For 13 hours they sat in the council 
chambers tallying the votes by hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, four ballots were invalidated. Montoya was elected by a single 
vote, launching the 28-year-old social worker on his political career. Five 
years later, when Montoya was elected to the state Assembly, Storing was 
reelected to the council to fill the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Garcia and Perez, other challengers in this year's election include 
Garrett Terrones, a 22-year-old department store cashier, and Edward Chavez, a 
substitute teacher. Sally Holguin-Fallon, who lists her occupation as 
"educator," is attempting to become the first woman elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia believes it is only a matter of time before one of the incumbents loses 
an election. "These people haven't been challenged, really. Now people that are 
running are working hard at it, walking the precincts, doing mailers and having 
fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
Palacio, a veteran politician with 40 years of public service, admitted that he 
has done little campaigning for this election. "I can't," he said, "because my 
bones are getting older." 
</P>
<P>
The white-haired councilman said he admires the persistence of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all over the place campaigning. More power to them," Palacio said. 
"But once I put my name on the ballot, they'll have to fight me for a seat. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lose, no problem," he continued. "Don't get me wrong, I want to win. But 
I've already had my glory."

LUMBERING RELICS OF WAR -- AND 5 PUPPIES -- ARE ON VIEW AT MUSEUM 
</P>

<P>
Don Michelson works every day at breathing new life into old weapons at his 
military museum in South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
So he took special delight last week when five new "weapons" drew first breath 
at the sprawling American Society of Military History park nine miles east of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A stray dog had crept among the World War II tanks and armored personnel 
carriers parked at the outdoor museum and given birth to a litter of squeaking 
puppies. 
</P>
<P>
"Call 'em watchdogs," said Michelson as he stood in the shadow of a 30-ton 
Sherman tank and cradled one of the tiny, brown-faced pups in his hands. "We've 
got five very vicious watchdogs here. Five watchdogs and one mommy." 
</P>
<P>
Michelson tries to keep security tight at his unusual 7 1/2-acre display of 
military hardware at the northern edge of the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
The huge guns that poke from the turrets of the drab-green tanks and aim 
skyward from rusting 40-millimeter antiaircraft batteries have been welded shut 
so they cannot fire. 
</P>
<P>
But 15 of the aging tanks, troop carriers and self-propelled antitank guns have 
been restored to running order by Michelson and his son, Craig, the museum's 
operations manager. Some sport heavy steel treads that would rip Rosemead 
Boulevard to shreds if sneaked outside for a joy ride. 
</P>
<P>
Michelson, 73, started the museum in 1962 by collecting old uniforms and 
insignias at the Los Angeles armory where he worked as post exchange manager 
for the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
The collection expanded to include weapons and vehicles after Michelson, of 
Westwood, bought a few surplus Army vehicles. He said his interest in rolling 
stock stems from service as an Army quartermaster supply officer for desert 
training in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The display now includes equipment from that war, the Korean conflict and the 
Vietnam War. All but about 20 of 100 vehicles have been loaned to the nonprofit 
society by the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment was moved to Whittier Narrows land leased from the Army Corps of 
Engineers seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most of it is so old that it will never run again. 
</P>
<P>
"They have very simple engines that are easy to fix. These engines are very 
tough; they were built to last," said Craig Michelson, 32. "But there aren't 
any parts." 
</P>
<P>
Some prizes, such as an M-47 tank used in Korea, sit idle for that reason. It 
needs six oil coolers that the Michelsons have been unable to find. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his father, Craig Michelson never served in the military. But he grew up 
around the war machines and later earned a degree in mechanical engineering 
from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the Army way to fix engines and the correct way," he said. "The Army 
did R and R. They removed and replaced engines when something went wrong. I do 
it the correct way. I repair." 
</P>
<P>
The museum loans out its drivable tanks and trucks to the American Legion, the 
VFW and Vietnam veterans groups to use in parades. Organizations are required 
to have enough liability insurance to cover such things as damage to street 
pavement before they can borrow them. 
</P>
<P>
Liability problems keep the 200 or so people who visit the museum each week 
from climbing aboard the old tanks and assault vehicles, Don Michelson said. 
Exceptions are occasionally made for veterans who delightedly discover 
equipment they used while in military service. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the Army camp-like museum has been open Saturday and 
Sunday afternoons to the public for a $2 admission fee. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the visitors volunteer to help refurbish their favorite piece of 
equipment. About 230 have joined the society. 
</P>
<P>
"One man has come out every Thursday afternoon to work on the same type of 
landing craft he used in four Pacific invasions in World War II," Don Michelson 
said. "He's sandblasting it down to the wood and metal and repainting it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with land and equipment for the museum, the government also has donated 
the fence that encircles it. Navy Seabees did the installation. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't secure enough to keep the museum's old watchdog in. Or to keep 
out the stray dog that the Michelsons have named "Momma." 
</P>
<P>
The pups will be given away. But the Michelsons plan to keep "Momma." 
</P>
<P>
Every Army unit needs a dogface.

CROSS-BURNING ATTEMPT IN LA CRESCENTA PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
RACISM: OFFICIALS DO NOT KNOW WHAT PROMPTED THE INCIDENT, WHICH DEPUTIES SAY IS 
THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE COMMUNITY.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and local school officials are 
investigating an attempted cross-burning at the home of a black family in La 
Crescenta, but neither the family nor investigators knew what might have 
prompted the incident, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Someone apparently tried to set a makeshift wooden cross afire early Saturday 
on the front lawn of a home in the 3100 block of Pontiac Street, Deputy Jerry 
Starks said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was out there on the lawn in our direct vision when we opened the drapes in 
the morning," said Lorna Kelly, 35, a nurse who has lived in the home for five 
years with her son, Kwame Barlow, 16. "It looked as though someone had made an 
attempt to burn it. There was soot on it, but it hadn't actually caught fire." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said she could think of no reason for the incident and had not 
experienced any racially oriented problems in the neighborhood. 
</P>

Ken Biermann, principal of Crescenta Valley High School -- where Barlow is one 
of six blacks in the student body of 1,600 -- said he questioned several 
students at the school Tuesday but had no reason to believe that any were 
involved in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Biermann said Barlow told him that he attended a party Friday night where he 
"had some hassles" with a few young people who are not students at the school, 
and had an argument with a classmate. 
</P>
<P>
Barlow told police that the cross was not on the lawn when he came home from 
the party about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. His mother found the cross, about 3 feet 
high and 2 feet wide, when she awoke later that morning. 
</P>
<P>
Starks, who has worked at the area sheriff's station for 18 years, said the 
cross incident was the first he knew of in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea what prompted or precipitated the action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Mornell, executive director of the Los Angeles County Human Relations 
Commission, said there were 167 racially motivated hate crimes reported last 
year, a 75% increase over 1988. Six of last year's incidents involved 
cross-burnings. 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's records, the only racially oriented incident in 
La Crescenta last year was vandalism at the home of an Armenian family.

COUNTY URGES BUILDERS' LEVY FOR FIREHOUSES

Los Angeles County officials, saying they need money to deal with a future 
shortage of fire stations in fast-growing unincorporated areas, have proposed 
taxing developers for every house and commercial facility built in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, presented to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, would add $471 to 
the cost of building a 2,000-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended fee would be slightly more than 2 cents for each square foot of 
floor space. 
</P>
<P>
The development fee would be restricted to construction in the Santa Clarita 
and Antelope valleys, as well as Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains 
corridor. The money would be used only for fire stations in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Without discussion, the board set June 21 as the date for a public hearing on 
the plan, which was written by the county's Fire and Public Works departments. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment, which would generate $33 million in the next five years, is 
needed to build 17 fire stations in that period, said Michael Freeman, the 
county's fire chief. The extra revenue also would be used to build an 
additional 33 stations that are expected to be needed by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said conventional methods of paying for new stations are inadequate 
because of rapid growth in outlying areas. Without more money, Freeman said, 
development would have to be curtailed, fire protection would diminish or 
taxpayers in other parts of the county would have to subsidize the construction 
of fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
Because the alternatives would be worse, Freeman said, the building industry 
has not opposed the plan.

ACTION URGED ON FREEWAY INTERCHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
CALTRANS: THE COUNCIL WANTS THE CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT TO BE FINISHED QUICKLY, 
BUT HOMEOWNERS ARE SUING FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday urged Caltrans to move quickly to build 
a controversial freeway interchange at Valley Circle Boulevard and the Ventura 
Freeway because state highway officials have expressed doubts about the 
$35-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred on by Councilwoman Joy Picus, lawmakers reaffirmed the city's 
longstanding support for the Caltrans project, which is now under legal attack 
by local homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Over my dead body will this be dropped," Picus said during an interview after 
the council voted 13 to 0 to reaffirm its support for the project and urge the 
California Department of Transportation to move "as expeditiously as possible" 
to complete it. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said the existing Woodland Hills interchange, designed to handle traffic 
in the 1950s, has produced "terrible bottlenecks" on adjoining surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hallin, Caltrans deputy director for Los Angeles, said the state has 
misgivings about the project because of the opposition. Homeowner groups, 
including the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, have sued Caltrans in 
state and federal courts to force a full environmental review of the project. 
The groups also have proposed an alternative to the solution the state agency 
has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't backed away from the project yet, but we are evaluating what to 
do," Hallin said. "We're asking ourselves if it's going to be cost-effective." 
If the agency is forced to conduct an environmental review, he said, "We may 
back away from the job." 
</P>
<P>
Final say over the project rests with the California Transportation Commission. 
But the commission can be influenced by the recommendations of Caltrans staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said the city backs Caltrans' interchange design. She said she is neutral 
on the issue of whether a full-blown environmental impact report is needed. "It 
doesn't seem like a good idea to me for Caltrans to fight doing an EIR if 
there's a 50-50 chance of having to do one anyway," she said. "I'd rather they 
just do the EIR and get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gross, president of the Woodland Hills group suing Caltrans, said the 
concern is that the project will direct more traffic into the area and 
"probably spur additional growth." A full environmental study is needed to 
determine the effect of the project on traffic and to propose ways to ease 
those effects if the project goes forward, Gross said.

FIRE AT RETREAT FOR HOMELESS CAUSES $25,000 SOIL DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A storage shed filled with paints, solvents and flammable liquids caught fire 
Tuesday, causing $25,000 worth of environmental damage to a retreat for the 
homeless in Canyon Country, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said hazardous materials, used in occupational training workshops, 
seeped into the ground with the water used to battle the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The contaminated soil will have to be removed and deposited in a special dump 
for toxic waste, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Mike Balzano estimated that the cleanup, which he said would be 
supervised by the Air Quality Management District and the state Office of 
Emergency Services, will cost between $20,000 and $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The fire occurred at a retreat for single homeless men in the 16300 block of 
Sierra Highway operated by the Venice-based Bible Tabernacle Church. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Peter Hilst said the camp shelters about 180 homeless people from the 
Venice area and gives them an opportunity to learn vocational skills. 
</P>
<P>
Hilst and firefighters said the blaze began when one resident set fire to a 
pile of leaves he had raked together outside the camp's auto body shop. Sparks 
from burning leaves ignited spilled paint, then the storage shed exploded in 
flames. Firefighters worked for an hour to control the blaze and prevent it 
from spreading to nearby brush. Several firefighters were treated for heat 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
The auto-body shop and a camp bus were destroyed, Hilst and firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
Hilst estimated the value of the destroyed property at about $2,000. But 
firefighters said the church will also be responsible for paying to clean up 
the toxic runoff.

AUDIT OF ELY'S COLLEGE DISTRICT EXPENSES NOT YET COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ventura Community College District Chancellor Barbara Derryberry said Tuesday 
that an investigation of board member Tom Ely's district expense records has 
not yet been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The board decided last month to hire an independent auditor after learning of 
Ely's alleged gambling activities and after a disclosure that he used his 
district telephones to call hotels and casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Derryberry said Ely received a copy of a draft report Friday of the auditor's 
findings. But Derryberry said she didn't know when a final report would be 
completed. Ely has said he needs more time to review the report before he can 
comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
During a board meeting Tuesday, Oxnard College Prof. Patrick Hughes appealed to 
board members to be fair to Ely. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to speak in favor of a sense of justice on the part of the board," 
Hughes said. "Much of the materials which have been published regard Dr. Ely's 
own private life. And while it makes a good smear, it has nothing to do with 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
Ely has admitted that he made personal telephone calls to Las Vegas on his 
district phone in the past, but said the nature of the calls were no one's 
business but his own. He said he would be happy to reimburse the district for 
the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, a candidate for county supervisor, has been dogged by controversy since it 
was revealed last month that he owed $3,000 in gambling debts to the Edgewater 
Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev., and that he was sued in February by the 
Golden Nugget in Las Vegas over $8,000 in alleged debts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a law enforcement source told The Times that Ely had amassed 
$40,000 in gambling debts at a number of Las Vegas casinos and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who was scheduled to address the board Tuesday, has admitted some debts 
but said his losses have been exaggerated.

GOING DEEPER THAN SEDUCTIVE SURFACE OF TELEVISION; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEO: A POMONA COLLEGE PROFESSOR TURNS A CRITICAL EYE ON THE MEDIUM AND ARGUES 
THAT VIEWERS MUST BECOME 'VISUALLY LITERATE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An image consultant told some worried members of Parliament last year, just 
before the first live televised proceedings of the British House of Commons, 
that 55% of their impact on viewers would come from the way they dressed and 
38% from the way they acted in front of the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Only 7% depended on what they said, the image consultant contended. 
</P>
<P>
It just goes to show what a complex instrument television has become, says 
Brian Stonehill. In 50 years, that novel little electronic receiver that could 
miraculously capture transmitted pictures in the home has become "a great truth 
teller and a powerful distorter of the truth," says the Pomona College 
professor of English and media studies. 
</P>
<P>
Television has penetrated far into space to bring us pictures of Jupiter and 
Neptune, and it has cluttered the airwaves with images of slogan-spouting 
politicians with chiseled profiles. It has given us stunning live pictures of 
historic moments, and it has manipulated young minds with seductive commercials 
pitching toys and candy. 
</P>
<P>
To separate the good from the bad in the Babel of pictures that rushes into our 
homes every day, Stonehill says, we have to be "visually literate." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to watch out for what we watch," says Stonehill, 36, a boyish looking, 
sharp-featured man with a tangle of dun-colored hair. 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill is one of a small but growing group of academicians who have turned a 
critical eye on video -- "the language in which our culture speaks to itself," 
as he puts it. 
</P>
<P>
He teaches a course at Pomona called "Arts of Persuasion," in which students 
analyze television programs and commercials from the perspective of the 
principles of rhetoric. In the fall, he'll teach a new course in visual 
literacy and oversee a program for majors in media studies. 
</P>
<P>
He has dabbled in television himself, notably as the script developer of the 
PBS show "French in Action" and as a host of a talk show for the Claremont 
public access channel. 
</P>
<P>
And Stonehill, who contributes commentaries to newspaper editorial pages, is 
one of commercial television's most persistent critics. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget that commercial TV's main function is to deliver the largest 
possible audience to the advertiser," Stonehill says. "Everything it does is to 
hold your attention for the commercials. That's what its function is. You have 
to recognize the devices it's using to get you to watch the commercials." 
</P>
<P>
To look beneath video's seductive surface, Stonehill takes his students all the 
way back to Aristotle and his principles of rhetoric. "Aristotle identifies 
three main ingredients in any persuasive situation," says Stonehill, who has 
been teaching at Pomona College for 11 years. "They're ethos, pathos and logos" 
-- or personal character, emotion and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
Television has translated those qualities, says Stonehill, into "sparkle, 
hearts and smarts," which can be seen in varying quantities during a day of 
commercial programing. 
</P>
<P>
"On the morning talk show, with the celebrities promoting their movies and so 
forth -- that's ethos or sparkle," he says. "Then the soap operas and game 
shows, they're big on hearts . . . pathos. The biggest intellectual demands of 
the day are the evening news shows, where you get smarts or logos." 
</P>
<P>
But the most powerful tool in the Aristotelian persuader's arsenal, Stonehill 
says, is something called "antithesis," or the practice of reducing issues to 
sharply delineate pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
"TV uses antithesis constantly, forcing issues through a filter that enhances 
conflict," says Stonehill. "You get a view of the world as one team pitted 
against another. It may not be true to the world, but it gets ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Politics, the abortion issue, cops and robbers, race -- all tend to be fitted 
into "a Monday night-football view of the world," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill, a graduate of Haverford College with a Ph.D. in English from the 
University of Chicago, says he got interested in media studies during the early 
stages of the Ronald Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
He said he started trying to understand why it was so easy to believe Reagan 
when, "if you read the text of his speech in the next morning's newspaper, he 
was clearly saying mostly nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the Great Communicator was extraordinarily adept at using both the 
television camera and his most powerful natural attribute -- his voice. "He has 
an amazing voice," says Stonehill. "When you listen to the tapes, he seems 
young and old at the same time. George Bush is having a harder time because he 
has nothing like the vocal instrument." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Stonehill was exposed to the usual baby-boomer's allotment of TV 
time. "My parents tell about the time I fell out of my high chair and hit my 
head," says the professor. "They were worried that I might have injured myself, 
so the doctor told them: 'Keep him up tonight. Don't let him go to sleep.' They 
propped me up between them in the bed and left the TV on until they fell 
asleep. Much later, they found me sitting there, watching the snow on the 
screen. I was already interested in what was behind the screen." 
</P>
<P>
The illiterates of video, Stonehill says, are viewers who haven't developed the 
sophistication to "find out about the puppet show they're watching." They're 
people who "think that celebrities on TV really use the products they're 
endorsing" or who "don't read behind the political commercials." 
</P>
<P>
But the medium's real victims tend to be children, who are targets of 
commercials for kiddie products, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Stonehill sees a lot of good in television. "A persuasive 
argument could be made that the events that are astonishing us in Eastern 
Europe right now are to a large extent the gift of TV," he says. "People there 
just could not resist what they were seeing on their TV screens regarding life 
on the other side."

WILLIAM VAN ORDEN DIES; FIXED LOY STATUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Van Orden, the sculptor known for his meticulous restorations of Venice 
High School's statue of actress Myrna Loy after numerous assaults on it by 
vandals, has died at 67. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who completed his 12th restoration of the statue despite ill health 
and waning strength, died of cancer March 18 at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Van Orden worked thousands of hours repairing the Loy statue 
and two other statues at the entrance of the campus that were the target of 
countless pranks and acts of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the Don Quixote of Venice," he said in a Times article last year. 
"They don't realize that I take that as a compliment. Myrna is my windmill." 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden was honored in June by Venice High School students at a dedication 
ceremony for the newly restored statue, which is now enclosed in a protective 
iron cage. He was also awarded a proclamation from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Myrna Loy statue first came to Van Orden's attention after vandals in 1978 
used dynamite to blow off its head and arms. A year later, Van Orden drove by 
and saw the damaged statue and, grabbing a tool box, began making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I took out my chisel and mallet and started hammering on it when the principal 
came out and asked me, 'What are you doing?' " he told The Times. "I said, 'I'm 
here to fix the statue.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Venice artist began his most recent restoration about a year ago after 
vandals battered the heads of all three statues. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden again rushed in to do repairs, but this time, he said, he did not 
believe he would live to finish the job. Doctors had told the artist that his 
death was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided not to abandon her," he said at the time. "I had to return one more 
time. This is my life's work, and after I finish this job I feel I can pass the 
job on to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
But Van Orden managed to complete the restoration of the 7-foot-tall statue of 
Loy, which is a depiction of the goddess Venus rising from the sea. It was 
sculpted in the 1920s by Harry Winebrenner, a nationally known sculptor who 
also taught art at Venice High School. He chose as his model a 16-year-old art 
student named Myrna Williams, who later gained fame on the screen as Myrna Loy. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden received an outpouring of support and national attention following 
news reports about his efforts to preserve the statue. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted so much to see it declared a historical landmark so it could be 
protected and preserved from future damage," said Rodan Van Orden, the artist's 
19-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden said his father never felt he received the recognition he deserved 
from his work on the statue. "You know he was a fine artist, a good painter." 
</P>
<P>
At Venice High School, officials and students were saddened by Van Orden's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"He always had time to sit and talk with the students. He touched a lot of 
lives here," said Sharon Gebhart, the school improvement coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who was born in New York City, is survived by Rodan; his mother, 
Emily Van Orden, 92; a sister, Jane Kowach, and three brothers.

WHY GAMBLE WITH OUR WATER?; 
</P>
<P>
NO ONE DOWNPOUR WILL HELP THIS SERIOUS LIQUIDITY CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians could lick the drought of 1990 before it even takes hold 
with three simple steps: 1) Give up washing autos by hand. 2) Stop hosing off 
sidewalks. 3) Reduce lawn-watering by half. These actions could save as much as 
200,000 acre-feet of water during June-September, according to the Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California. That is the equivalent of the annual 
need of about 400,000 families -- and roughly the size of Metropolitan's 
projected water deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
The family auto might get a little dustier, but motorists still could go to 
carwashes that use recycled water. A broom or electric leaf-blower will clean 
the sidewalk just fine. The average lawn will fare every bit as well getting 
water only every other day. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other ways to conserve. These suggestions do not even touch the 
inside of the home, where a little more than half the average family water use 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The need for conservation became startlingly more apparent Tuesday. The Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power announced that it would seek as much as 
444,000 acre-feet of water from Metropolitan in 1990-91, primarily because of 
critically short supplies in the city's Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The 
444,000 acre-feet is nearly double the city's current-year draw from Met and 
more than 10 times what the city took a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Met, the wholesale agency for the six-county region, still is expected to have 
enough water to meet the demands of all 27 member districts -- the area's water 
retailers -- but only by drawing down reservoir storage to about half of normal 
levels. To deplete the reservoir carry-over to that extent risks getting caught 
with a critical shortage in 1991 if next winter is another dry one. But the MWD 
could keep that water in reserve if residents would save the equivalent amount 
through conservation. Most cities already have programs in place that would 
save that much water -- if everyone cooperated. But if real savings are to be 
achieved, it appears those programs will have to be made mandatory, with rigid 
enforcement and punishment, such as that proposed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley if voluntary measures do not cut usage by 10% in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Now the choice is ours: at most, a little inconvenience this year, or the risk 
of real hardship down the road.

If we vote for a higher gasoline tax for better roads, we are guaranteed that 
the tax will stay around forever, but we are not guaranteed that the revenue 
will be used for highways forever. 
</P>
<P>
History has shown that, in many cases, a tax for a particular purpose ends up 
in the general fund either directly or indirectly. What has happened to all the 
past taxes that we were promised would be used to fix up the roads? 
</P>
<P>
We, the voters, see government getting more inefficient at our expense. Until 
we get guarantees for our money, we will be reluctant to vote for any new 
taxes.

<P>
The editorial on Prop. 111 was right on target and should be required reading 
for every California voter before the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce believes passage of Prop. 111 is 
absolutely essential to California's continued economic health and vitality -- 
and for our quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
This measure will finance desperately needed transportation and infrastructure 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, Prop. 111 will modify the state's spending limit formula and 
the budget process. Without this crucial change, the state faces diminishing 
funds for higher education, health care, law enforcement, and a whole range of 
other critical programs and services. It could cripple California. 
</P>
<P>
The choice is clear. We must invest in California now.

THE TIDE PUSHES US ALL TOWARD PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR: THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THE LAST NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE FMLN 
AND THE GOVERNMENT. WE NOW HAVE MODELS FOR A RETURN TO TRUE, UNTHREATENED 
DEMOCRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALVADOR SAMAYOA, Salvador Samayoa is a member of the Political/Diplomatic 
Commission of the FMLN and a member of the FMLN's negotiating team at the 
U.N.-mediated meeting in Geneva. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
GENEVA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new round of negotiations opens here today between the government of El 
Salvador and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). The last 
time the two parties met was October 16, 1989, in San Jose, Costa Rica. No 
progress toward a negotiated solution was made at that time. 
</P>
<P>
But dramatic events have occurred in the intervening months in El Salvador, and 
continue to occur in the Central American region and around the globe, with 
repercussions on the possibility for a solution of the conflict in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
I have little doubt that the tide of history will push all parties toward an 
end of the armed conflict, toward peace, toward models of genuine democracy 
that exclude the domination of military forces over civil society and the 
maintenance of unjust economic and social structures. The historical tide will 
also certainly leave stranded those models of revolution and social progress 
based on totalitarian or single-party regimes with excessive state control of 
the economy and society. 
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to accept the much-discussed "end of history" put forth by 
political scientist Francis Fukuyama, or even the "ideological evolution of 
humanity" (which is what, more precisely, Fukuyama ought to have proposed as 
his thesis) in order to accept the basic principles of the liberal democratic 
state as a rational form of society and state to which we can legitimately 
aspire. 
</P>
<P>
So, leaving aside for now all of the obfuscation put forth by proponents of the 
end of history and the proclaimers of the victory of Western-style liberalism, 
we of the FMLN believe, with great enthusiasm, that the possibilities for real 
democratization and peace in our country are better now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War leaves the United States without its ideological or 
geopolitical concern and/or justification for supporting anti-democratic armies 
and governments in Latin America. This is acknowledged even by the most 
conservative ideologues in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Events in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia 
have established precedents of great political importance to the case of El 
Salvador: Political constitutions can be changed, new houses of Parliament can 
be created, general elections can be called -- all in a matter of days and 
without bloodshed -- if there exists the political will to resolve problems in 
a democratic manner. 
</P>
<P>
The electoral process in Nicaragua, its outcome and the imminent peaceful 
transfer of the control of the state apparatus also provide important political 
dividends to the democratic and revolutionary forces of El Salvador. In 
Nicaragua, the Sandinista National Liberation Front refuted the contention that 
revolutionary movements cannot accept -- much less push forward -- an authentic 
democratic process. This fact could translate into a gain in credibility for 
the similar democratic option that the FMLN is proposing for El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the army in Nicaragua is going to be reduced substantially, as a 
product of political negotiations between the government and the opposition. 
This is another precedent applicable to El Salvador, despite the great 
political differences between the right-wing Salvadoran government and the 
Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's elections will be the yardstick, strict and demanding, by which the 
democratic will of the Cristiani government in El Salvador will be measured. 
The six months of international monitoring in Nicaragua exposed, by comparison, 
the purely cosmetic purpose served by "international observers" on Election Day 
in El Salvador's last vote in March, 1989. Nicaragua's electoral registry, the 
makeup and functioning of the Central Elections Council and the enforcement of 
laws guaranteeing the rights of political parties to equitable access to the 
media will also be models. 
</P>
<P>
This is the context in which the negotiations in Geneva are beginning. It is an 
unquestionably positive context for attaining democracy and peace. It is our 
hope that the Cristiani government will understand that the political winds, 
rather than blowing against the FMLN, as many in his government say, may well 
be blowing against the intransigence and obsolete authoritarianism of his own 
party, his own army, and his own regime. 
</P>
<P>
If President Alfredo Cristiani can read the signs of the times well, no more 
blood need be shed in El Salvador, and for the first time in our history the 
possibility of real peace -- based on the democratization of society -- will be 
opened.

ONE POTENTIALLY LETHAL DISEASE; 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: WE ARE AWARE OF A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL ILLS. BUT THE GREATEST 
THREAT OF ALL IS STILL THE GROWING NUMBER OF US. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL R. EHRLICH and ANNE H. EHRLICH, Paul and Anne Ehrlich teach at Stanford 
University. Their latest book is The Population Explosion (Simon &amp; 
Schuster, 1990). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statistics on the population explosion are staggering. When we were born, 
there were 2 billion people on the planet. When "The Population Bomb" was 
written in 1968, there were 3.5 billion. Today, there are 5.3 billion. Since 
"The Bomb," more people have been added to the human race than existed when 
World War I was fought. Each year the population grows by numbers equivalent to 
the combined citizenry of Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Belgium, Denmark, 
Norway, Sweden and Finland. This unprecedented expansion fuels virtually every 
human problem, from hunger, global warming and AIDS to smog, traffic jams and 
international conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, people require the services of natural ecosystems to live, and 
human population expansion constitutes a massive assault on those systems. 
Indeed, the entire globe is now overpopulated by a simple standard: Humanity 
cannot now be supported on income -- that is renewable resources. Even though 
billions of people live in poverty that would appall the average American, 
civilization endures only by using up a one-time bonanza of "capital" -- 
especially deep, rich agricultural soils, Ice Age ground water and 
"biodiversity" (populations and species of other organisms that are working 
parts of life-support systems). Earth's farmers must feed 95 million more 
mouths annually with 25 billion tons less topsoil, trillions less gallons of 
ground water and diminishing help from natural systems with climate control, 
pest management and pollination. We are squandering our inheritance and calling 
it "growth." 
</P>
<P>
The most serious population problems are centered in the United States, not 
only because it is the fourth most populous nation, but also because the 
average American has an enormous impact on environmental systems and resources 
compared to citizens of poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
Overpopulation among the rich, barely one-fifth of the world's people, now 
accounts for well over half the deterioration of global life-support systems. 
But poor nations will soon pose greater threats to those systems as their 
expanding populations struggle to develop. Suppose that Indian and Chinese 
populations increase their per-capita commercial energy consumption (using 
their abundant coal) to 7% and 14% of our present level respectively. Their 
populations are so huge that each would contribute as much to global warming 
from coal burning as the United States now does -- and coal supplies almost 
one-quarter of our commercial energy. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that the greatest threat to the security of the United 
States is environmental, nor that an unsustainable expansion of human numbers 
is partly to blame. Americans are aware of global warming, acid precipitation, 
ozone depletion, loss of biological diversity, deforestation, desertification, 
the garbage crisis and increased vulnerability to epidemics. But most have yet 
to recognize that these are all symptoms of one potentially lethal disease: the 
expansion of human numbers and the human economy. 
</P>
<P>
For nine years now, the United States has moved backward in both environmental 
protection and dealing with population problems at home and abroad. The first 
retreat can be traced largely to the "get ours now and the hell with posterity" 
philosophy of the Reagan era. The second is the result of disastrous national 
policies reinforced by taboos of both left and right. 
</P>
<P>
Those on the left are afraid that focusing on population would distract 
attention from the increasingly desperate social needs of the nation. That must 
be guarded against. 
</P>
<P>
On the right, confusion of family limitation with abortion has led 
anti-abortion forces to oppose needed measures. But both they and supporters of 
legal abortion could join hands and work to see that all sexually active people 
have access to safe and effective contraception. History shows that the only 
effective way to reduce the number of abortions is to give people control over 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
No one, of course, thinks that simply lowering birth rates below death rates 
and bringing population growth to a halt will solve all human problems. 
Environmental deterioration, warfare, hunger, racism, sexism, religious 
prejudice and gross economic inequity could still persist. Those problems must 
all be tackled as well, especially because diverse groups must cooperate if 
civilization is to survive the environmental crunch and a new and sustainable 
human community is to evolve. But none of those problems will ever be solved 
without population control. 
</P>
<P>
Those who think these notions impossibly idealistic should reflect on how 
fantastic it would have seemed a year ago that East Germany would now be 
selling pieces of the Berlin Wall on the open market. When the time is ripe, 
societies can change with blinding speed. Our only chance is to ripen the time.

A 6-year-old kindergartner suffered massive head injuries Tuesday after he ran 
into a street and was struck by a car near Bostonia Elementary School in El 
Cajon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle B. Davis was flown to Children's Hospital, where he was on a life-support 
system, a hospital supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and a friend were waiting to be picked up about 11:25 a.m. at Grape 
Street and Broadway when he ran north on Broadway toward his school, police 
spokeswoman Sheri Naumann said. He was run over by a 1984 Toyota pickup truck 
driven by Todd Higgens, 25, of El Cajon, Naumann said. 
</P>
<P>
Higgens was not held and police are investigating.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TERROR STALKS THE VIETNAMESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An implied article of American faith is that people shouldn't be persecuted 
either for their political ideas or their commitment to them. A fierce 
intramural squabble in the local Vietnamese-American community is putting that 
belief to an important test. 
</P>
<P>
It's no small added concern that lives are literally at stake. 
</P>
<P>
For several years now, shadowy anti-Communist groups have terrorized the 
Vietnamese community with threats and occasional violence. The FBI has been 
investigating the arson death in 1988 of a Garden Grove newspaper publisher, 
for example, and Westminster police are concerned about a death threat recently 
made against the editor of a Vietnamese-language newspaper and several other 
prominent citizens. At issue is whether the U.S. should normalize relations 
with the Communist government of Vietnam. The targets of the threats all are 
certifiably anti-Communist, but they're apparently not anti-Communist enough 
for extremists in the refugee community. But even if they were Communists, they 
would have the right to express their views in this country without fear. 
</P>
<P>
Normalization of relations with Vietnam may seem like strictly an internal 
matter to Vietnamese-American extremists. It isn't, of course, because the 
larger American community has a stake in this issue -- just as it has a stake 
in how the debate is conducted. The chairwoman of the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission recently condemned the death threats, and it would be good 
for the entire commission to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom has lured many immigrants to these shores. But freedom lies as much in 
a willingness to allow others to exercise it as it does in claiming it for 
ourselves. Debate over normalization of relations with Vietnam should be held 
in a rational and peaceful atmosphere, in keeping with the best American 
tradition.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: POWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A family of three escaped uninjured from a burning house in Poway, fire 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze raced through the single-family home in the 14000 block of Durhullen 
Drive a little after 6 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
By the time 27 firefighters from Poway and San Diego brought the fire under 
control in about 20 minutes, 90% of the house was damaged. The loss was put at 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to fire officials, the owners' son, who is a college student, heard a 
humming noise in the air conditioning system and saw smoke coming from the 
vents. He woke his parents, Henry and Marian Ponsford, and escorted them to the 
back yard, said Poway battalion chief Garry MacPherson. The son's name was 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson said an electrical flaw in the fan's motor ignited the fire.

TRUSTEES DEBATE STARTING, ENDING TIMES FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversial question of whether starting and ending times should be 
rotated in the interest of fairness among 137 of the 152 schools of the San 
Diego Unified School District came before trustees Tuesday in the first of 
several public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Payzant proposes rotating times every three years to allow all schools 
periodically to have desired early starting and ending times. 
</P>
<P>
Because the district has a plethora of special integration and special 
education programs that result in bus transportation of students all over the 
city, schools now must start and stop at different times based on the limited 
number of buses available to deliver students at any given starting times. They 
range from 7 a.m to 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant's proposal would keep all senior highs on a uniform 7:30 a.m. starting 
time because of afternoon athletic schedules. But the rotations proposed for 
every other school encountered rough sailing during initial public testimony 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents complained of the difficulty in rearranging child care and car 
pools every three years. Teachers and parents at the School of Creative and 
Performing Arts -- a grade four-through-12 facility -- said its placement with 
elementary schools on a rotating schedule would wreak havoc with after-school 
rehearsals during the years it would be on a late schedule. 
</P>

Trustees will continue with public hearings April 17. DAVID SMOLLAR

BUILDERS' LEVY FOR FIREHOUSES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials, saying they need money to deal with a future 
shortage of fire stations in fast-growing unincorporated areas, have proposed 
taxing developers for every house and commercial facility built in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, presented to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, would add $471 to 
the cost of building a 2,000-square-foot house. The recommended fee would be 
slightly more than 2 cents for each square foot of floor space. 
</P>
<P>
The development fee would be restricted to construction in the Santa Clarita 
and Antelope valleys, as well as Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains 
corridor. The money would be used only for fire stations in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Without discussion, the board set June 21 as the date for a public hearing on 
the plan, which was written by the county's Fire and Public Works departments. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment, which would generate $33 million in the next five years, is 
needed to build 17 fire stations in that period, said Michael Freeman, the 
county's fire chief. The extra revenue also would be used to build an 
additional 33 stations that are expected to be needed by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said conventional methods of paying for new stations are inadequate 
because of rapid growth in outlying areas. Without more money, Freeman said, 
development would have to be curtailed, fire protection would diminish or 
taxpayers in other parts of the county would have to subsidize the construction 
of fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
Because the alternatives would be worse, Freeman said, the building industry 
has not opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say generally the developers have been supportive of the fee," Freeman 
said. "They're seeing it as a life safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
The county also will ask the cities of Santa Clarita, Palmdale and Lancaster to 
adopt the same fee schedule so needed fire stations could be built within their 
city limits. The county provides fire service for the three cities.

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pain sent shivers of concern up and down his body Tuesday, causing tears to 
drip from his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Padre third baseman Bip Roberts bit his lower lip, put a bulky brace on his 
right knee, wiped away the tears, and ran back onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who developed swelling in his right knee that just won't seem to go 
away, knew he probably shouldn't be going back onto the field. It's only spring 
training. Why take a risk? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a year ago, Roberts mused, there would have been no doubt what he would 
have done. He'd inform trainer Dick Dent that maybe it'd be best he sit this 
one out. He'd tell Padre Manager Jack McKeon all about it. 
</P>
<P>
And there he'd be, sitting on the bench with street clothes, watching his 
teammates play without feeling the least bit of remorse. 
</P>
<P>
But on this day, Roberts didn't say a word. Not to Dent. Not to McKeon. Not to 
any of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
He came back on the field and took batting practice, just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
He went out to the field and shagged balls, just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
He came off the field, but before heading into the clubhouse like everyone 
else, he was pulled aside by McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts wasn't going to be playing 
</P>
<P>
But this was McKeon's decision; not Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Roberts will tell you, it makes all the difference in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"People can give all the reasons they want about my turnaround last year, but 
if you want to know the truth," Roberts said, "Tempy (Padre shortstop Garry 
Templeton) is the one most responsible. He got me going because of an incident 
in LA, and ever since that, I've had this drive and determination that I never 
had before." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in late June at Dodger Stadium. Roberts' ribs were hurting, and 
he was lying on the trainers' table icing a sore ankle when Templeton entered 
the room. Templeton asked what was wrong, and Roberts told him, saying he 
wouldn't be able to play that night. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Roberts might as well have said that he bleeds Dodger Blue by the way 
Templeton reacted. Templeton chewed him out, telling him that he plays with 
pain every day of his life, and you don't see him bailing out of the lineup. If 
Roberts wants to be somebody in this game, Templeton said, a commitment better 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that, he chewed me out but good," Roberts said. "I was 
hurting pretty good, but he got me so upset, crying and everything, that I went 
out there that night and didn't feel a thing. There was no pain. 
</P>
<P>
"He turned on a switch for me, and I'll always be grateful to him for that." 
</P>
<P>
It indeed was like a different player suddenly transformed out of the same 
body. This was a guy who had made just 18 starts and was batting .278 at the 
time of the incident. But after a few choice words by Templeton, Roberts batted 
.307, starting 60 of the Padres' remaining 74 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I really got on him," Templeton said, "and I know I got him pretty upset. I 
told him the difference between the majors isn't that big, and if you want to 
hang around here, you better play with some pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at him now, from that moment on, he's been the best player on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who said he aggravated his knee by playing on the hard infield at 
their spring-training complex in Yuma, is expected to be back in the lineup 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him ready for opening day," McKeon said, "that's my concern. There's 
no sense in taking any risks now." 
</P>
<P>
Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn laughed when he first heard it. Then, he started 
thinking about it. And he started getting worried. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so funny, any more." 
</P>
<P>
The hottest rumor in New York has Gwynn being traded to the New York Mets for 
third baseman Howard Johnson and pitcher Ron Darling. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how it started, or if it has the least bit of substance 
considering it's been denied by the Mets and Padres, but it's out there 
lurking. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother heard it at Dodgertown," Gwynn said. "So he called my mother. My 
mother called my wife. And she called me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard it, I just laughed. But then I drove around in my car, and 
thought about it hard. I'm not counting anything out. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, there's nothing I can do but just wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will open the 1990 season in just five days on Monday in Los 
Angeles, but to many in the Padre clubhouse, the most important date on their 
minds is Friday, April 13. 
</P>
<P>
That is the day their former teammate, Dave Leiper, will undergo open heart 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most important thing right now," Padre catcher Mark Parent said. 
"There's a lot of us worried about him in here. You realize there's more 
important things in life than baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Leiper, who spent 2 1/2 seasons with the Padres before being released in 
December, suffered heart palpitations again three weeks ago while working out 
in the Oakland Athletics' mini-camp. He was taken to a Phoenix hospital when it 
was discovered, he said, what was described to him as an extra passageway to 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to take that out," Leiper said. "They could zap it electrically, but 
the surest thing is to open me up and get it. I'll be out of the hospital in 
five or six days, but it'll take a while for the sternum to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"I could probably get by if I keep taking medication, but later in life, they 
said, something could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just as soon get it over with now. They said the first available date was 
Friday the 13th, and asked if I minded. I said, 'Nah, I'm not superstitious. 
Just get me in there.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Padres plan a visit to Leiper in the hospital the following day in Redwood 
City, Calif. As fate would have it, they'll be in San Francisco that weekend 
for a three-game series against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Leip we'll all be there," Parent said. "Nothing's going to keep us away 
from seeing him." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre chief executive Jerry Kapstein came to Palm Springs Tuesday night to meet 
with Manager Jack McKeon and Bill Beck, assistant to the vice 
president/baseball operations. McKeon still has not talked with anyone in the 
prospective ownership group. . . . Considering that 10 men will be owners of 
the Padres if the sale should go through, the joke in the clubhouse was that 
perhaps a bumper sticker should be made: "Honk, if you own the Padres." The 
Padres (8-2) won their sixth consecutive game Tuesday, defeating the Angels, 
11-3. The Padres, who also overcame a deficit for the sixth consecutive time, 
were led by rookie outfielder Jerald Clark, who went three for four with a 
two-run homer. . . . Ed Whitson was the winning pitcher, yielding five hits and 
two runs in five innings. "I love pitching here," Whitson said, "because they 
use that red clay on the mound. I told our people a couple of years ago that if 
they'd order that clay, I'd pay for it. But I'm still waiting."

HE MADE MASTERS A SCRAMBLE; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: IN 1980, BALLESTEROS HIT SHOTS FROM PLACES FEW HAD EVER IMAGINED AS HE 
BECAME THE YOUNGEST WINNER AT AUGUSTA NATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three white golf balls -- where there should have been only two -- dotted the 
seventh green of Augusta National as Andy North and David Graham approached the 
hole during the second round of the 1980 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the elevated green stood a scowling Severiano Ballesteros, who saw 
nothing funny when Graham said, "Are you playing through, or would you like to 
putt out for an eagle?" 
</P>
<P>
The scowl deepened when North began to laugh as he realized what had happened. 
Ballesteros had teed off on the 17th hole and hit a towering hook that carried 
over a stand of majestic Georgia pines and pastel-shaded dogwood and dropped 
onto the putting surface of the adjacent seventh hole. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice drive, Seve, you're closer to the hole in one than I am in three, so how 
about if I play your ball?" the former U.S. Open champion kidded. North's 
second shot had landed in a bunker and his blast out fell short of the green. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros never smiled. He had been seething since before he teed off after 
taking three putts on the 16th green. 
</P>
<P>
"I swing too hard, I am very mad," he explained later. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 minutes, while North chipped up and he and Graham putted 
out, a green-coated Masters committeeman arrived and showed Ballesteros where 
he could drop his ball on the fringe of the seventh green for his second shot. 
</P>
<P>
Between the ball and the flagstick, in addition to the towering pines, was a 
20-foot high scoreboard and a grandstand full of Masters patrons (In 
Mastersland, there are no fans, or spectators. All the paying customers are 
patrons). Another long delay ensued while the gallery was moved to make way for 
Ballesteros' shot. 
</P>
<P>
Once he knew where his ball lay, Ballesteros walked through the pines and 
halfway down the incline toward the 17th green, where his playing partner, 
Larry Nelson, waited patiently, and somewhat curiously. He had seen 
mini-miracles by the youthful Spaniard earlier that day and he almost expected 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
He got it. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros returned to his ball, took a seven-iron from his bag and after his 
caddie stepped aside, lined the club up with the corner of the scoreboard. Then 
he took his stance over the ball, his dark eyes darting first to the 
scoreboard, then back to the ball and then to the scoreboard again. He waggled 
his club head a couple of times before drawing the club back and driving the 
ball high into the blue Augusta sky. 
</P>
<P>
It disappeared from sight behind the trees, but its direction and subsequent 
landing were identified by a mighty roar that went up from the crowd around the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros scrambled down the hill, through the pink, red and white azalea 
bushes that make Augusta National what it is. He saw where his ball had landed 
only when the crowd parted at the green's edge and he stepped into the 
spotlight to the crescendo of another thunderous cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The brooding scowl disappeared as he saw the dimpled Titleist only 15 feet from 
the pin. 
</P>
<P>
"I line up (the ball) with right side of scoreboard," Seve said later. "It give 
me the line. It good place for scoreboard, give good line." 
</P>
<P>
When he sank the birdie putt moments later, the legend of Ballesteros was 
taking form. He had celebrated his 23rd birthday only two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The three shots that Friday on No. 17 were only a small fraction of the 275 he 
took to become the youngest winner in Masters history, but Ballesteros' 
flamboyance, style and pizazz set him apart from the generally bland 
shot-makers around him. When Fuzzy Zoeller, the 1979 champion, helped him on 
with the green jacket emblematic of a Masters victory, the Spaniard had became 
a world force in golf. 
</P>
<P>
That birdie, plus five others that day, gave him a four-stroke lead after 36 
holes, and he extended it to seven in the third round and to 10 after the first 
five holes of the final round -- only to lose eight of those strokes before 
rallying to fend off Australian Jack Newton and American Gibby Gilbert and win 
by four. 
</P>
<P>
From the birdie he made on the second hole -- a 555-yard par-five -- of the 
first round, Ballesteros was never out of the lead. He shot a 66 that day, but 
everything took second billing to the plight of Tom Weiskopf on that windy 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Weiskopf, the 1973 British Open champion, had won 13 tour events and more than 
$1.7 million in the 15 years since leaving Ohio State with one of the sweetest 
swings in golf. As he approached the dazzlingly beautiful 12th hole, he was 
even with par. It was only 155 yards from the tee, across Rae's Creek, to the 
green, backdropped by an amphitheater of multicolored azaleas, white and orchid 
dogwood and yellow jasmine. 
</P>
<P>
Weiskopf's tee shot, with a seven-iron, landed on the fringe of the green but 
too much backspin made it back up and roll tantalizingly down the embankment 
into the creek. The tall, erect Weiskopf -- four times a runner-up in the 
Masters -- walked briskly to a drop area about 20 yards from the water and 
dropped a second ball over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
His sand wedge shot looked like a mini-version of the first. It, too, hit the 
fringe and then backed up into the creek. Another drop. A desultory shot that 
plopped into the water. Another drop. A worse shot that almost didn't reach the 
water. Another drop. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, hitting what was his 11th stroke on the scorecard, Weiskopf's ball 
cleared the creek and landed left of the shallow green. A chip and a putt gave 
him a 13. No one else had ever shot a 10 over par on a single hole in the 44 
years of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing," a surprisingly calm Weiskopf said later in the locker 
room. "I thought I hit the first one good, but I had too much (backspin) on it. 
Then I took a drop and the drop area was still wet from yesterday's rain and 
the grass was thin. I should have gone back a few yards, but all I could think 
about was hitting it and getting out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Weiskopf, who had a reputation for storming off courses, even in mid-round, 
when things didn't go well, not only finished his round with an 85, but also 
came back the next day and shot 79 -- thanks in part to two more watery shots 
at No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
He missed the cut by 18 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
The swirling winds of Augusta National took their toll of favorites Tom Watson 
and Jack Nicklaus at the same hole, the one Bobby Jones called the Golden Bell 
when he built the course for the inaugural 1934 Augusta National Invitational 
Tournament. It wasn't until 1938 that the tournament became known as the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, the tour's leading money winner the previous three years, bogeyed No. 
12 on Thursday and then put two balls into Rae's Creek for a triple bogey on 
Saturday, falling from contention. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, winner of five previous Masters, found the water for a double bogey 
in the first round and was never a factor after taking three putts on six 
greens in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros teed off late in the afternoon of the first round, when the wind 
was gusting a bit stronger than earlier, but he shot a six-under-par 33-33 -- 
66 and shared the lead with David Graham, a touring Australian, and Jeff 
Mitchell, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound rookie. Craig Stadler, playing with 
Ballesteros, had a 74. 
</P>
<P>
Many higher scores -- 76s by Lanny Wadkins and Sandy Lyle, 77s by Curtis 
Strange and Billy Casper and, of course, Weiskopf's 85 -- were blamed on the 
capricious, ever-changing, winds. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, hitting the fairway off the tee on all but one hole, was boringly 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hit the ball well, it doesn't matter if the wind is blowing or not," 
Ballesteros said. "I play more in England than anywhere else and that is where 
I practice and the wind is always blowing. 
</P>
<P>
"Players should not be concerned too much with the wind. If you think too much 
about it, you lose your swing." 
</P>
<P>
When the putter is working as well as Seve's was that day, it also tends to 
make one feel better about the wind. He sank birdie putts of 15, 12, 15, 10 and 
25 feet, plus a pair of two-putt birdies on par-five holes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was a different day for him off the tee. He was as wild as he had been 
straight the previous day, but he had a logical reason: "Yesterday was Thursday 
and today is Friday and you know, that's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The heroics started early. He hooked his tee shot into the dogwood on No. 2, 
but the ball caromed back into the fairway, from where he ripped a one-iron 
second shot into a greenside bunker. He blasted out and sank a 10-foot putt for 
his first of six birdies. 
</P>
<P>
On No. 14, a 420-yard par-four, he hooked his drive so far left that he had to 
loft a pitching wedge over a stand of pines to the green. Twenty feet. One 
putt. Another birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Seve summed it his round succinctly: "All hooks, all birdies, I think they good 
drives. It is very boring if just fairway, fairway, fairway. It doesn't matter 
where you hit the drive if you make the putt." 
</P>
<P>
Rex Caldwell, happy-go-lucky product of San Fernando Valley State College, now 
Cal State Northridge, shot a second-round 66 and moved into second place, but 
he was four shots shy of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
On a gloomy, muggy Saturday that turned into a day-long drizzle, Ballesteros 
kept the patrons interested with four bogeys, an eagle, six birdies -- and only 
seven pars. 
</P>
<P>
He got the eagle on the 530-yard eighth hole when he followed a long drive with 
a 245-yard three-iron shot that stopped five feet from the pin. 
</P>
<P>
He need a stroke of good luck to salvage a bogey on No. 5, a 450-yard par-four, 
where he drove his tee shot so far into the woods that he hit a provisional 
ball in case he couldn't find the first one. 
</P>
<P>
"I was saying to myself when I was looking for my ball, 'Seve, you're going to 
take double bogey here, but even if you do you'll still be one shot ahead so 
keep calm and don't get mad.' Then I found my ball, I know I save a stroke." 
</P>
<P>
The shot went up, as he had planned, and dropped over the pines onto the 
fairway, from where he chipped up and took two putts for his bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good, make bogey and go on. Everyone makes bogeys at the Masters. 
What difference does it make when you make them? Just go on to next hole." 
</P>
<P>
On the next hole, 190-yard No. 6, he demonstrated what he meant. He hit a 
seven-iron shot that landed on the green and rolled across a corner of the hole 
before stopping less than a foot away for a tap-in birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed when it didn't go in," he said, only half joking. "I 
thought it was going to be a hole in one, and I have never had one." 
</P>
<P>
The 68 pulled him seven strokes ahead as Caldwell dropped back with a 72 and Ed 
Fiori, another Southern Californian who learned his golf on public courses 
around Downey, took over second with a roller-coaster round of 69. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, before Ballesteros teed off, he was all smiles. 
</P>
<P>
An early morning downpour turned Augusta National into a 365-acre hothouse and 
Ballesteros turned the heat up another notch with birdies at the first, third 
and fifth holes to go 10 shots up on Newton and Gilbert, who admitted they were 
playing for second money. 
</P>
<P>
The only excitement was whether Seve might shoot 67 and earn a $50,000 bonus 
from Golf magazine for breaking the tournament record of 271 set by Nicklaus in 
1965 and equaled by Raymond Floyd in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Seve was playing the front nine, Houdini couldn't have caught him," 
Newton, his playing partner in the final round, said. It was one of the last 
times Newton appeared in a major tournament. Early in 1983 he lost his right 
arm and eye after walking into a spinning propeller of a private plane in 
Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
But Ballesteros' magic was turning to ashes. He bogeyed No. 10 with three putts 
but hardly anyone noticed. At No. 12, the breezes that often change direction 
in a ball's mid-flight caught Seve's six-iron tee shot. The ball looked as if 
had been struck perfectly when it left his club, but it hit a swift gust and 
fell short of the green and bounded from the embankment into Rae's Creek. 
</P>
<P>
A sand wedge from the drop area -- the same one where Weiskopf had suffered 
three days earlier -- reached the green for a two-putt double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, Seve was still smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not worried. I always make double bogeys. I think I make pretty good 
swing so I go on to the next hole. Thirteen is my lucky number. I was glad it 
was thirteen that was next." 
</P>
<P>
The race was tighter than Ballesteros knew. Newton, the Australian Open 
champion and one of Seve's best friends on the European tour, had birdied Nos. 
11 and 12 and the 10-stroke margin had been cut to five. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, who had birdied the short par-five 13th all three days, put his 
tee shot in the middle of the fairway and took out a three-iron for his second 
shot to the green. He hit it fat. He knew immediately it had no chance to cross 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
He managed to salvage a bogey, but when Newton countered with a third 
consecutive birdie, the margin was a precarious three shots. 
</P>
<P>
Good fortune, which had seemingly turned its back on the Spaniard, returned to 
his side on No. 14, where his drive hit a tree and bounded down a steep incline 
onto a patch of pine needles. When he got to his ball, he surprisingly found an 
open shot to the green, from where he hit a six-iron 25 feet from the hole, 
saving par. 
</P>
<P>
"That shot from the woods was the turning point," Newton said later. "He could 
have been in the woods without a shot, and even after he hit it out he was far 
enough away to three-putt but he hit a great first putt. If he had bogeyed that 
hole it might have been a disaster for him." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros said that his next two shots, a drive of 310 yards down the right 
side of the fairway and a four-iron over a pond to the 15th green, were his 
most important of the day. Both were on the hole where Gene Sarazen made his 
legendary double-eagle 2 with a four-wood in 1935. To reach the hole, players 
must walk across the Sarazen bridge to the left of the green. "I'm in the water 
two times already. If I put the ball in the water again, it's bad, very bad," 
Ballesteros said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros got his two-putt birdie on 15 and parred the final three holes, 
becoming the youngest Masters champion. He was 23 years 5 days old when he 
first wore the green jacket. Nicklaus, at 23 years 2 months, had been the 
youngest when he won in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is back, looking for a third green coat in the Masters, which will start 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, fresh off a senior tour victory, hit a spectator with a golf 
ball Tuesday during a practice round at Augusta National. Nicklaus, a six-time 
Masters champion, hooked his second shot on the 555-yard second hole and the 
ball hit the spectator below the right eye. Nicklaus came over and apologized. 
The man, who was not identified, left the course to receive medical treatment. 
</P>

1980: A NEW MASTER AT AUGUSTA 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros was all over the course, once even hitting the wrong green, 
but he led by 10 shots early in the final round and became the youngest winner 
of the green jacket. Here are the top finishers in that tournament of a decade 
ago.

The last test was run. The last bit of therapy administered. The last hope 
exhausted. And finally, Tuesday, the Kings' worst nightmare officially became 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, the club's superstar center and the greatest scorer in league 
history, will miss at least the first two games of the Kings' first-round, 
best-of-seven playoff series against the Calgary Flames because of a back 
injury suffered March 22. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly thought I'd be ready to play Game 1," Gretzky said by phone from 
his home. "But it's a little worse than anyone thought it was. It just hasn't 
come around. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad for everyone, including Bruce (McNall, the owner). I'm letting a 
lot of people down. If I could even skate, I'd play." 
</P>
<P>
The back spasms that initially troubled him are gone, but Gretzky remains sore 
and stiff. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no strength in my back," he said. "It bothers me when I try 
to bend over and pick up my daughter (15-month-old Paulina). There has been a 
100% improvement since last week, but there is still a long ways to go." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky will stay home and continue daily treatments of heat, ice and massage 
with the hope of returning to the ice Sunday when the series switches to the 
Forum for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether Sunday is in the cards, I just don't know," he said. "The pain part 
doesn't bother me. I have no problem playing with that." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in his 11-year career that Gretzky has missed a playoff 
game after appearing in 131 of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst," he said of sitting out a playoff game. "It's what I look 
forward to all year." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's injury is the latest, and certainly the heaviest, in a series of 
season-long blows that seemed to send the Kings reeling every time they 
appeared ready to make a charge. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Coach Tom Webster fell in the shower and required ear surgery. 
Goalie Kelly Hrudey was in and out of the lineup with an adult form of 
mononucleosis, as was Larry Robinson with various problems. 
</P>
<P>
The club traded Bernie Nicholls for Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom, only to 
have both of them go out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
But all that appeared behind the Kings on St. Patrick's Day, when Gretzky 
knocked in the winning goal in the final minutes to break a nine-year losing 
streak against the Bruins at Boston Garden. It was the Kings' season-high 
fourth win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Who could dream it would be Gretzky's last hurrah? 
</P>
<P>
By that evening, he was limping from a groin strain. 
</P>
<P>
No big deal. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky rested for two games, returned against the New York Islanders and was 
his old self. 
</P>
<P>
For one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he got hit in the back by Alan Kerr. The blow sent Gretzky crashing into 
Ken Baumgartner, creating a whiplash effect. 
</P>
<P>
That was a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
With a hyper-extension of the back, soreness and inflammation, Gretzky has not 
been on the ice since. 
</P>
<P>
The series that opens tonight wasn't one the Kings figured to win anyway. The 
better question now would be, can they win a game? 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, spurred by the presence of Gretzky, the Kings finished second in 
the Smythe Division, came from a 3-1 series deficit to upset the Edmonton 
Oilers and were still swept by the Flames, the eventual Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Kings finished fourth in the Smythe at 34-39-7, while the 
Flames soared to their third consecutive division title, winding up 42-23-15. 
</P>
<P>
Still, ever the cautious coach, Calgary's Terry Crisp was unwilling to concede 
his team had a big edge without Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Or even that there would be no Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"If Wayne's not here," said Crisp, allowing himself a chuckle before he 
continued, "what are the Kings supposed to do, die? Fold up their tents and 
fade into the night?" 
</P>
<P>
Crip's attitude is reflected throughout his team. Fearing a psychological 
letdown should Gretzky suddenly appear, the Flames keep smirking about this 
"scam" by the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
There were few smiles here in this ski resort 81 miles outside of Calgary where 
the Kings are preparing for life without Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not dwelling on it," Marty McSorley said. "Everybody else seems to be 
dwelling on it. But we don't hold private conversations about it. If we look 
over in the dressing room and see him there, we'll be happy. If we don't, we 
still have a game to play." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey insists things will change from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't ready for Calgary last year," he said. "We were still too excited 
about our win over Edmonton. This year will be different." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't figure to be unless Gretzky recovers in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
There was some talk that he might come up just to watch, but that's not going 
to happen either. 
</P>
<P>
"The treatment I'm getting is so important," Gretzky said. "If I came up there, 
I'd miss it. I don't want to mess with that." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he'll turn on the three television sets in his home and move from one 
to the other during the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I get too nervous," he explained, "to sit in one spot." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw will also sit out because of a back injury. Recovered 
enough to play are Dave Taylor, who has been out with a groin strain, Steve 
Kasper, sore neck, and John Tonelli, flu. No decision yet on Larry Robinson, 
who has been out with a groin strain. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were shut out three times this season, twice by Calgary and on both 
of those occasions by goalie Rick Wamsley. Terry Crisp is expected, however, to 
go with starter Mike Vernon in the net. . . . Kelly Hrudey will start in goal 
for the Kings, backed up by Mario Gosselin. . . . Tonight's game, which begins 
at 6:30 PDT, will be carried live on both Prime Ticket and KLAC (570).

U.S. IS AMONG EIGHT TEAMS TO PLAY IN INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE

The Federation Internationale de Volleyball will try to create a consistent 
interest in men's volleyball with an international league offering $1 million 
in prize money to teams from eight countries, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first league of this type in sports," said Doug Beal, director of the 
U.S. national team, at a press conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The World League will supplant the World Cup and World Championships. Those 
events tend to only get tremendous attention in the country that is hosting 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Beal said that the league grew out of the frustration in trying to support and 
train a national team in non-Olympic years. 
</P>
<P>
The FIVB will try to expand Olympic interest with the World League, which 
includes the U.S., France, Italy and Brazil in one division and the Soviet 
Union, Japan, China and the Netherlands in the other. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will open the season against France April 29 at the Forum in 
Inglewood. The Americans will also play France on April 30, then Italy on May 
5, and Brazil on June 2 at the Forum, and Italy on May 6 and Brazil on June 1 
at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Teams will play division opponents four times -- two at home and two away -- 
and the top two teams in each division will meet in the playoffs at Osaka, 
Japan in July. 
</P>
<P>
The FIVB also has an agreement to have all the league matches televised, home 
and away. The U.S. matches will be shown, delayed, by SportsChannel. 
</P>
<P>
Individual match winners will receive $1,500 and the losers will get $1,000. 
The division champions will receive $80,000 and the second through fourth-place 
teams will get $60,000, $40,000 and $30,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff champion will receive $140,000.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Wayne Gretzky can't play, I like Calgary over the Kings in four games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Stanley Cup playoffs should be as wide open all the way as the NCAA 
basketball tournament was until the final. Boston had the best record in the 
league, but in no way is to be confused with the old Bobby Orr machines. 
Calgary is the defending champion, but is not playing nearly as well as a year 
ago. Les Canadiens no longer scare anyone. The ex-Broad Street Bullies from 
Philadelphia didn't even make the playoffs. About half the 16-team field has a 
legitimate shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dynasties have been the rule, not the exception, in the NHL lately. Edmonton 
won four of five Stanley Cups from 1984-88. The New York Islanders won four in 
a row from 1980-83 and Montreal four in a row from 1976-79. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Kings never have won two consecutive playoff series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, no Los Angeles sports fans are more enthusiastic than those at the 
Forum during the hockey playoffs. Standing ovations when the team comes onto 
the ice are mandatory. And some guests at the hotel across the street thought 
there was an earthquake the night of April 10, 1982, when the Kings rallied and 
beat Edmonton in overtime and the cheers and foot-stomping of 16,005 fans shook 
the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sportsmanship and the NHL aren't exactly synonymous, but the handshakes that 
follow the end of every Stanley Cup series should be copied by other sports. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
NBC made a mistake by televising the NHL All-Star game instead of a 
championship series game or two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't hold your breath for this one to happen, but the Clippers would love to 
trade Benoit Benjamin and their two first-round draft choices to Houston for 
Akeem Olajuwon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas could become the first school to repeat as NCAA basketball 
champion since UCLA in 1973, but only if Larry Johnson returns for his senior 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How decisive was UNLV's victory over Duke? The margin of 30 points was seven 
more than those of the previous eight championship games combined. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A tribute to the Runnin' Rebels' physical conditioning is that they ran more 
than anybody else in Denver, but were less bothered by the altitude. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to Mike Krzyzewski, a good loser Monday night, and Jerry Tarkanian, a 
good winner. . . . Coach Lon Kruger's five-year contract at Florida reportedly 
is worth $625,000 a year, including money from TV and radio shows and summer 
camps. And for every year that the Gators are put on NCAA probation because of 
violations committed by the old regime, a year will be added to Kruger's 
contract. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Alabama Birmingham's Gene Bartow turned down a deal that would have been worth 
$600,000 a year at Texas A&amp;M. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Seve Ballesteros and Bucky Dent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In non-lockout years, this is the most appealing week of the sports calendar: 
NCAA basketball championship game, opening of the baseball season and the 
Masters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall has found regular work as Keith Hernandez's replacement at first 
base for the New York Mets, who have demoted Dave Magadan to the bench. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's early, but Chris Berman seems better suited to the studio than baseball 
play-by-play for ESPN. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers always act as though they're doing a player a favor when they trade 
him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Does anybody really think Danny Ferry is going to spend another year in Italy 
before joining the Cleveland Cavaliers? . . . 
</P>
<P>
This might finally be the season that Pat Riley gets what he deserves, the NBA 
coach-of-the-year award. . . . Outfielder Michael Moore of Beverly Hills, who 
plays wide receiver in the fall and is the nephew of Ahmad Rashad, is the only 
member of the UCLA baseball team who has a batting cage in his back yard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bruin forward Trevor Wilson, whose stock rose in the NCAA tournament, will 
participate in the NBA prospects' camp next week in Orlando, Fla. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The John Wooden of volleyball coaches, UCLA's Al Scates, will be honored at 
ceremonies before the championship match of the Diet Pepsi-UCLA Collegiate 
Volleyball Classic Saturday night at Pauley Pavilion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner is financing and taking an active interest in the Florida 
Clippers track club in Tampa, which will send world-class sprinter-hurdler Tony 
Dees to the Jack In The Box meet May 20 at Drake Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Orosco wore No. 47 and his record with the New York Mets was 47-47. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Enough, already, of the Jim Valvano saga.

MELVIN DURSLAG: PLAYING EVERY DAY IS MERELY PART OF JOB

<P>
At the last inspection, made at the end of the 1989 season, Mr. Cal Ripken Jr. 
performs in his 1,250th consecutive game in the sport of rounders. 
</P>
<P>
That is an awful lot of consecutive games, proof of which is only two others in 
the majors have pulled off more. 
</P>
<P>
One is Lou Gehrig, 2,130. The other is Everett Scott, who, at 148 pounds, rolls 
out of Bluffton, Ind., to play shortstop for the Red Sox and Yankees and logs 
1,307 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
If an achievement could look over its shoulder, the one of Scott's would be 
troubled today by an advancing Ripken, who, conditions willing, could be 
passing 1,307 a couple of months after the start of this season. 
</P>
<P>
In roughly 5 1/2 years, Ripken could be passing Gehrig. Since Cal is 29, such 
an achievement is possible, although you nibble for a price on it in the 
neighborly state of Nevada and you're going to come up with numbers pretty big. 
</P>
<P>
In the training quarters of the Baltimore Orioles, this entertainer stands 
before you, looking more like a tight end than a shortstop. You develop an 
image of Ozzie Smith, 160, skipping, with dancer's grace, right and left. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in Ripken, you see a guy they might call Horse, coming to bat last year 
646 times, not counting the times he walks, sacrifices and gets hit by pitches. 
</P>
<P>
You ask Cal about the streak and he is reluctant to talk, mainly because he 
doesn't see it as anything out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
One draws wages, he says, to play in 162 games, and Cal feels it is newsworthy 
only if one plays in fewer. 
</P>
<P>
The point he makes is interesting. Do you read, for instance, that Wade Boggs 
is going to play? It makes a news item only if Ripken doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Now you ask the manager of the Orioles, Frank Robinson, how he would react if 
Ripken began to look tired. Would Frank make a dramatic speech about a 
commitment to the team and bench Cal for a game? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," he answers. "One game isn't that important. For me to take him out of 
the lineup would require, on his part, an incapacitation." 
</P>
<P>
"What if he had a hobble?" Frank is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A hobble makes a tougher decision for a manager than an incapacitation. But 
don't look for me to set him down." 
</P>
<P>
A thought then occurs to Frank, and he smiles thinly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to wait until the streak reaches 2,129," he says. "And then I'm 
going to tell him, 'Hit the pine. You need rest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Fox, the former big league manager, now scouting for Houston, is 
kibitzing. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ripken is my guy, I shift him to third," he says. "It's much easier on a 
player's body. You don't move as much at third as you do at shortstop. And you 
don't figure in the breakup play. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how often shortstops and second basemen get creamed on the 
breakup? Big as Ripken is, some rabbit may nail his knee going into second, and 
that's the end of the Cal's streak." 
</P>
<P>
The streak of Steve Garvey, fourth longest in baseball history, came to a 
finish not when a rabbit slid into Garvey, but when he slid into a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended about nine years of unbroken play, during which Garvey, sensitive to 
disrupting flukes, wouldn't attempt household repairs, especially on a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether a guy has a streak going or not, that's the way a big leaguer should 
operate," says Robinson. "Don't paint the house or fix the roof. Pay a 
craftsman. And never beat a bellman out of a tip by lifting your own luggage." 
</P>
<P>
Since Ripken began the streak in 1982, Baltimore has played 12,412 innings, of 
which Cal has been in the game 12,380. 
</P>
<P>
You are not looking at a guy coddled in his mission. He was removed the last 
four innings of the final game last year. In another game, an umpire removed 
him in the first inning, after divergent opinions over a called strike. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only time during his big league existence that Cal has been kicked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken eats normally, sleeps normally, exercises normally. He doesn't stand on 
his head in a darkened closet, doesn't chant, doesn't carry religious symbols, 
or require chiropractic ministrations. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't meditate, listen to hypnotic tapes, practice kung fu, or get 
friction massages. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles had better keep an eye on this fellow. He might need observation.

JUDGE EXPECTED TO RULE FOR CRUMP'S ATTORNEY; 
</P>
<P>
GATHERS' AFTERMATH: L.A. PROBATE COURT APPEARS SET TO GIVE PHILADELPHIA LAWYER 
CONTROL OF ESTATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Philadelphia attorney Martin Krimsky is expected to be appointed as the special 
administrator in California of Hank Gathers' estate by a Los Angeles probate 
court today. 
</P>
<P>
A legal battle surrounding Gathers' death began this week with attorneys 
representing the Gathers' family and Gathers' son fighting to be appointed to 
administrate the estate, which at this time has little value. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, the former Loyola Marymount basketball star, collapsed during a game 
March 4 at Gersten Pavilion and died shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hearing, held in closed chambers, was a result of a petition 
requesting that Gathers' brother, Derrick, be appointed administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing against that petition was Krimsky, who already has been appointed 
administrator of the estate by a Pennsylvania court. He received the 
appointment at the request of Marva Crump, the mother of Gathers' only child, 
6-year-old son Aaron Crump, who was born out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Robert J. Blaylock of Los Angeles probate court is expected to 
announce his decision this morning. Attorneys representing each side, however, 
said Tuesday that Krimsky would be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Fagel, a Beverly Hills attorney representing the Gathers -- mother 
Lucille, brothers Derrick and Charles and Lucille's sister, Carol Livingston -- 
said Tuesday during a news conference that he does not believe that Aaron Crump 
is the sole heir to the estate. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Derrick Gathers should be appointed as administrator because he 
best knows what Hank Gathers intended if he became an NBA star. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers, also attending the news conference, said the family plans to 
take care of Aaron the way Hank "would have wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Krimsky's appointment will allow him to file claims and act on behalf of the 
Gathers' estate in California. Krimsky would serve in that capacity until a 
general administrator is appointed, which is expected to be decided April 16. 
</P>
<P>
Krimsky and Derrick Gathers have filed petitions in Los Angeles requesting to 
be appointed general administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of who is administrator is pertinent because it will determine which 
attorney has power to authorize lawsuits filed on behalf of the estate. That 
could be important if film rights or publication rights to the story of 
Gathers' life are sold. 
</P>
<P>
Not all lawsuits, however, need the authorization of the administrator. Those 
affected in wrongful death suits are entitled to file separate claims. In 
California, wrongful death suits cannot be filed by the estate. The estate can 
file survivor claims. If a suit existed before a death, the estate could 
continue the action. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, if wrongful death suits are in the interest of family members, they 
file the same claim. And in California, wrongful death suits, no matter how 
many heirs join in, are usually consolidated and one verdict is returned. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Elliott Almond contributed to this story.

Sacramento King owner Gregg Lukenbill and four others have been indicted on 
misdemeanor charges for their alleged role in the campaign to defeat a proposal 
for a new baseball stadium in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>

Olympic steeplechaser Henry Marsh said in Salt Lake City that he had been 
suspended by The Athletics Congress for failing to report for a drug test.

If upheld, the ruling virtually precludes the Utah runner's bid for the 1991

NHL PLAYOFF PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
STRUGGLING OILERS OPEN AGAINST JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, after winning four Stanley Cups in five seasons, the Edmonton 
Oilers had to learn to live without Wayne Gretzky, who led them to the titles. 
</P>
<P>
They did all right in the regular season, but when they faced Gretzky and the 
Kings, they were knocked out in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Until about a month ago, the Oilers, although they played much of the season 
without goaltender Grant Fuhr, one of the best, appeared to be a legitimate 
contender for the Cup again. 
</P>
<P>
As they open the NHL playoffs tonight at Edmonton against the Winnipeg Jets in 
the first of the best-of-seven series, the Oilers are again without Fuhr and 
are below their February peak. Fuhr reinjured his shoulder Friday and may not 
be available for the opener. 
</P>
<P>
And backup netminder Billy Ranford, who played well in the middle of the 
season, has tailed off. 
</P>
<P>
However, they figure to get to the division final against either the Kings or 
the defending champion Calgary Flames because the Jets are not accustomed to 
winning playoff games, especially against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets were one of only five teams who did not make the playoffs last spring. 
They have qualified for postseason play seven times, but have won only two 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Usually they wind up playing the Oilers. In 19 playoff games against Edmonton, 
the Jets have won only once. 
</P>
<P>
First-year coach Bob Murdoch, a longtime defenseman for the Kings, has done a 
remarkable job with the Jets. But they lost all four games at Edmonton this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The other games tonight involve the Norris Division teams. The Chicago 
Blackhawks, who won the division, open at home against Minnesota and Toronto 
plays at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks and North Stars figure on a brawling series. They had 
free-for-alls in several games this season. The Maple Leafs finished below the 
Blues, but hammered them, 7-1, during the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Bruins, the lukewarm favorite to win it all after being the only 
team to earn 100 points, play Thursday night at home against Hartford. The 
Whalers have a 2-1-1 record at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In other openers Thursday, the Rangers and Islanders play in New York, New 
Jersey faces Washington and Montreal meets Buffalo. DAN HAFNER

Greg LeMond, two-time winner of the Tour de France, will stay out of racing 
this month to recuperate from a virus, his Z cycling team said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The illness caused LeMond to drop out of recent races, cancel the rest of his 
European spring season and return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't ride for all of April," team spokesman Michel Laurent said. "He is 
going to use the rest of the month to rest." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond returned to his Wayzata, Minn., home over the weekend to rest and 
prepare for the Tour de Trump in May. He plans to return to Europe for the Tour 
of Italy, May 18-June 6 before the start of the Tour de France, June 30.

AT AGE 53, DON NYGORD HAS A SHOT AT THE WORLD CUP PISTOL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every person has a sport that's right for them, one they can excel in. 
</P>
<P>
That's what a friend told Don Nygord. All you have to do is find it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of false starts, Nygord, a two-time Olympian, found his sport, 
and he modified her adage in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Once you find it, stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
Nygord, 53, is a 12-year member of the U.S national shooting team, which will 
compete at the first World Cup shooting competition held in the United States, 
at the Peterson Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino today through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nygord grew up in Oregon, which he describes as an area where a lot of 
"informal shooting" goes on, his first sports had nothing to do with guns. 
Nygord was a wrestler and fencer at Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried fencing and enjoyed that," Nygord said. "I tried wrestling. I wasn't 
bad at it, but apparently I wasn't right for it." 
</P>
<P>
The right sport surfaced while Nygord was in the Air Force in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked to come out and try out for the base pistol team after bragging 
about how I could shoot bottle caps off of rocks at unimaginable distances," 
Nygord said. "It turned out to be more difficult than I thought, but I took to 
it rather quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, Nygord became the national civilian champion. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the height of my ambition at the time," he said. "Then after I laid 
off for a while, I kept getting these things in the mail that kept inviting me 
to the tryouts for the U.S international team, based on some shooting I'd done 
casually. Finally, one year (1978) I decided to go and see what they were like, 
made the U.S. team and made it every year since." 
</P>
<P>
Nygord will compete in the free and air pistol competitions at the World Cup on 
Wednesday and Thursday, and will be competing for an available slot in the 1992 
Olympics. In pistol competition, the shooter fires 60 record shots over a 2 
1/2-hour period from a distance of 50 meters -- 165 feet. The target has a 1 
1/2-inch center ring worth 10 points and concentric rings that decrease in 
value by one point. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that shooting is probably 90% mental," Nygord said. "There's 
probably 25 people that, as far as skill level goes, are capable of winning 
these matches, but there's probably five or six that win 80% of them." 
</P>
<P>
Although shooting does not command the same attention and respect in the United 
States as it does in Europe, Nygord has made a name for himself 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
In the Seoul Olympics, where Nygord had the distinction of being the oldest 
U.S. Olympian, he tied for ninth place. At that, though, he scored the most 
points that any American ever has in Olympic shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Training takes up a great deal of Nygord's time, and it is not simply a matter 
of going down to the local range and firing a few rounds. Nygord does weight 
and aerobic training to build strength and endurance, and loads up on 
carbohydrates before competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old joke that NRA stands for Not Really Athletes, but that's not 
true anymore," Nygord said. 
</P>
<P>
Mental strength is also a factor, which Nygord exploits through a technique 
called visualization. It is a technique Nygord divides into two categories, 
strategic and tactical. 
</P>
<P>
In the first type he might visualize himself as a gold-medal winner to boost 
his self-image. The tactical technique involves going through the actual firing 
of the gun in his mind immediately before competing. 
</P>
<P>
This week's competition may be a pivotal point in Nygord's career, since, he 
said, his performance has been erratic lately. He did not finish well in a 
recent competition in Mexico City, but did very well in a National Rifle Assn. 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"After the '88 Olympics we had to give some serious thought to whether we would 
compete or not," Nygord said. 
</P>
<P>
"Age isn't necessarily a barrier, not everybody is in the same shape at 57 or 
27 as any other."

SIMI VALLEY GIVES QUINA FOOTBALL JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Quina hopes to become a Pioneer in the truest sense of the word after 
becoming one, at least in name. At a news conference Tuesday at Simi Valley 
High, Quina officially was introduced as the school's new football coach. 
</P>
<P>
For Quina, 34, it is his first head coaching job and it brings with it the 
challenge of rebuilding a program that has struggled to a 1-19 record the past 
two seasons. Quina, an insurance salesman who will be a walk-on coach, intends 
to use a positive attitude to blaze a trail out of the league's cellar. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't had a lot of success here in terms of wins and losses, and I 
don't think there was anything necessarily wrong with what the old regime did," 
Quina said. "I just think they needed some new enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Quina succeeds Dave Murphy, who resigned in November after a six-year tenure in 
which the Pioneers were 21-40-1. Murphy, the school's second-winningest coach, 
said a lack of support slowed the program's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't set any league-championship goals because I don't think it's 
realistic," Quina said. "My first goal is to increase interest." 
</P>
<P>
Quina will try to bring optimism to a program that has not had a winning season 
since 1985, when it posted its best mark (9-3) and won its only Marmonte League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get the kids to believe in themselves, that they can win, then we 
will do well," Quina said. "The importance is in effort and attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Quina, an assistant at Moorpark High the past two seasons, graduated from Royal 
and was an assistant there from 1980-84.

NORTHRIDGE WIN STREAK SNAPPED AT 8 GAMES

<P>
Fresno State took advantage of five errors to score four unearned runs and beat 
Cal State Northridge, 10-1, in a nonconference baseball game at Pete Beiden 
field in Fresno on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was held to four hits and the Matadors' eight-game winning streak 
was snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State pounded four CSUN pitchers for 15 hits as the Bulldogs, ranked 
23rd in the nation by Baseball America magazine, improved to 23-11. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (20-13) tied the score, 1-1, in the third when Craig Clayton drove 
in Mike Solar with a sacrifice fly. Solar and Kyle Washington walked to lead 
off the inning, and Solar went to third on Mike Sims' fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Spellman (1-2) took the loss in relief. Starter John Bushart allowed three 
hits and an earned run in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Valley 5, Ventura 3 -- Valley Coach Chris Johnson had previously turned to Mike 
Roberts for relief. Now Johnson realizes he has been wrong from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson started Roberts, a reliever, and the sophomore picked up his second win 
in as many tries in a Western State Conference game at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, scattered four hits in five innings and Dan Carroll mopped up in 
relief, striking out five in four innings. It was the third consecutive win for 
Valley (11-15-2, 7-6). 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't hit the ball particularly well today, but our pitching has come 
through for us," Johnson said. "We've been shuffling our pitchers around trying 
to find something that worked. We were down to the point of picking names out 
of a hat. Roberts hung in there and Carroll did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Chad Ratliff, E. J. Pape, Ed Aguilar and Kevin Thomas each had two hits for 
Valley, which is alone in fourth place in the conference standings. The top 
five teams advance to the WSC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been inconsistent," Roberts said, "but now we're starting to gel. 
Everybody is playing up to their potential." 
</P>
<P>
With his team leading, 5-3, in the bottom of the ninth, Carroll surrendered 
consecutive walks to Ross Gotwals and Dan Madsen after retiring the first two 
batters on fly balls. Carroll then struck out Gabe Diaz to end the game. KIRBY

MOSHER HIT BREAKS UP PITCHERS' DUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Gallegos vs. Robert Cardenas was not exactly the pitching duel many 
expected to see when Hilltop High and Castle Park got together for a Metro 
Conference baseball game Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But it did nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop's Chad Mosher was not exactly the masher fans expected to see win the 
game either. But he did nicely, too. 
</P>
<P>
Mosher's game-winning hit -- a lined single to left-center field that drove in 
Johnny Garibay from third -- came with two strikes and two outs in the bottom 
of the seventh inning to give Hilltop a 2-1 victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
To add spice, Mosher had been in an 0 for 13 slump since another game-winning 
seventh-inning hit against Granite Hills earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hitting the ball, just at everybody," Mosher said. "I knew something was 
going to fall in sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop (8-3, 3-0) and Castle Park (7-4, 2-1) came in tied for first with 
Montgomery High (9-3, 3-0), a 2-0 winner over Sweetwater (8-4, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Many thought the pitchers for this important league game would be junior 
fireballers Jose Silva (Hilltop) and Benji Gil (Castle Park). Both coaches -- 
Hilltop's John Baumgarten and Castle Park's Bob Korzep -- decided otherwise, 
but neither was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegos, a junior right-hander, used a curve ball, a drop and a straight ball 
("You can't call it a fastball," he said) to limit Castle Park to four hits and 
keep the Trojans off balance for six innings. JIM LINDGREN

Former San Diego State running back Darrin Wagner has signed a two-year 
contract with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, putting an 
official end to Wagner's stormy college career. 
</P>
<P>
A source said the two-year deal is for a little more than the league average, 
which is $43,000 a year in American money. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, 19, will report to training camp June 12. If he makes the team, he will 
be the youngest player in the CFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reaching on the kid now, but he was real productive when he got the ball," 
said Mike McCarthy, Argonaut vice president/general manager. "He was in 
no-man's land in school. There was nothing there for him. Sometimes you see 
something in a kid, and you try to help." 
</P>
<P>
After redshirting in 1988, Wagner rushed for 720 yards and scored 11 touchdowns 
in seven games at SDSU last season but was suspended on Nov. 5 after missing 
several practices without permission. At that time, he led the Aztecs in 
rushing and led the nation's freshmen in rushing and all-purpose yards. SCOTT

LUGINBILL RECRUITING DRAWS PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE SAN DIEGO STATE COACH HAS DENIED THE CHARGES MADE BY THREE 
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE COACHES.

A protest lodged by three California community college football coaches over 
the recruiting practices of San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill will be reviewed 
by a committee of the California Community College Football Coaches' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to meet in San Francisco April 26-27, said Jack 
Jordan, association president and coach at San Joaquin Delta College in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said the committee could impose sanctions that could include preventing 
SDSU football coaches from recruiting on California community college campuses, 
and obtaining game films and academic transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints were lodged last fall by coaches at San Jose City, Merced and 
Cerritos colleges. The coaches said they stem from conversations they had with 
Luginbill about high school players Luginbill was recruiting in 1989. The 
coaches allege Luginbill acted improperly in steering at least one player to 
Mesa College in San Diego, and threatened to discredit their programs with 
coaches and players in their districts if they did not cooperate with him in 
his recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he wrote to Jordan about three months ago denying the charges. 
Jordan said Luginbill will be invited to testify before the sanctions 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not do anything," Luginbill said. "It is incorrect in any way, shape or 
form. For them to even consider sanctions is completely off base. I didn't act 
as any agent, and there were no threats." 
</P>
<P>
The first complaint concerned Donnell Ragsdale, a wide receiver from Oak Grove 
High School in San Jose. Ragsdale signed a letter of intent in February 1989 to 
attend SDSU, but he did not meet NCAA freshman eligibility requirements and 
instead enrolled at Mesa last summer and played football in the fall. Luginbill 
has said Ragsdale enrolled at Mesa so that he might be able to obtain an 
associate of arts degree by this summer and transfer to SDSU for the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Gay, coach at San Jose, said he was interested in Ragsdale and charged 
Luginbill steered Ragsdale to Mesa in violation of state community college 
assn. rules. Those rules prohibit someone from acting as an "agent" by placing 
a player in a school outside of his community college district. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said when he talked to Luginbill about the alleged infraction, Luginbill 
told him he would advise others not to send their players to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Merced Coach Tony Lewis lodged a similar complaint. According to Lewis, 
Luginbill wanted Anthony Austin, a running back from the Los Banos High School, 
to enroll at Mesa last summer. Lewis said he persuaded Austin to stay near home 
and play at Merced. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis alleges Luginbill tried to pressure him to have Austin obtain a degree in 
time to transfer to SDSU for the 1990 season. He said when he told Luginbill 
that was impossible because of Austin's poor academic record, Luginbill became 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Gay and Lewis said they contacted Frank Mazzota, coach at Cerritos College and 
association president at the time, to complain. Mazzota said when he called 
Luginbill to discuss the charges, the conversation became heated and he charged 
Luginbill also threatened to discredit his program. 
</P>
<P>
All three coaches said they have no evidence that Luginbill carried out the 
alleged threats. 
</P>
<P>
"I never threatened Howard, Mazzota or Lewis," Luginbill said. "I told Howard 
that he didn't have any right to state where any student-athlete is going to 
school. For him to think he does is totally wrong. This isn't Russia -- it's 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said that if sanctions are imposed, they will be voluntary on the part 
of the association's 78 member schools. He said no action is being contemplated 
against the players involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to penalize young athletes from the chance of getting a 
scholarship," Jordan said. "But at the same time, we don't want the kids to be 
misled when something is not in their best interests." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU will still be in spring football in late April when the sanctions 
committee is supposed to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to miss spring football," Luginbill said. "They can hear my side 
-- they know where I am. I've got a conference phone. The whole thing is 
absolutely ridiculous."

JAPAN TO END BAN ON PURCHASES OF SATELLITES MADE IN OTHER NATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: NEGOTIATORS IN WASHINGTON ARE SAID TO BE NEAR AGREEMENT ON EASING 
ANOTHER SOURCE OF FRICTION -- CURBS ON IMPORTS OF SOME U.S.-MILLED WOOD 
PRODUCTS.

Japan agreed Tuesday on the major elements of an accord to end its longstanding 
ban on government purchases of foreign-made commercial satellites, but U.S. and 
Japanese negotiators said they still must iron out more details before the pact 
becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Tokyo will obtain all future commercial satellites through 
open, "non-discriminatory" bidding instead of protecting its domestic satellite 
manufacturing firms. Only government purchases of research-related satellites 
would remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also agreed to revamp plans for its proposed CS-4 communications and 
weather satellite -- a potentially lucrative project from which foreign bidders 
had been barred -- to allow non-Japanese firms to bid. 
</P>
<P>
The revamped version of the CS-4 proposal will force the Nippon Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co., Japan's private telephone giant, to go to the private market to 
buy the satellite services that it otherwise would have received from the CS-4. 
U.S. firms will be able to bid on those. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate estimate of how much the deal would provide in potential 
sales for American satellite-makers. The typical satellite runs between $200 
million and $650 million. Japan currently has some 43 of these in space; about 
five are U.S.-made. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the formal accord, which negotiators said could come by late 
April, would represent the second of three narrow -- but politically important 
-- trade disputes that the two sides have settled in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On March 23, the two governments came to terms on a pact ending Japan's 
previous ban on government purchases of foreign-made supercomputers. And they 
reportedly are moving toward resolution of a third barrier that limits imports 
of U.S.-milled wood products. 
</P>
<P>
All three issues were targeted by the Bush Administration last year as 
"priority" trade disputes. Unless all three are resolved by mid-June, the White 
House will be under pressure to impose retaliatory trade sanctions on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as high-level negotiators continued broader talks here on 
the so-called Structural Impediment Initiative, designed to alter fundamental 
economic and business practices in both countries to help pare America's 
$49-billion trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Although negotiators on both sides insisted that the SII talks are still making 
progress, U.S. officials said the negotiations were dragging on longer than had 
been expected because of differences over details of the basic accord. 
</P>
<P>
Today, two special emissaries sent by Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu -- 
Nobuo Matsunaga, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States, and Hisashi 
Owada, the deputy foreign minister -- are scheduled to meet with President Bush 
on the SII talks. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the two sides hope to issue an "interim report" that is 
expected to form the basis for stepped-up negotiations before the final 
deadline for the negotiations in mid-July. The talks, unprecedented in their 
scope, have been under way since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy on satellites that Tokyo has pledged to adopt would allow 
government agencies and major Japanese telecommunications and broadcast 
companies to buy foreign-made satellites for the first time. It would not apply 
to satellites used for government research and development. 
</P>
<P>
It would not apply to satellites that either test new technology or conduct 
government scientific research for under government aegis. 
</P>
<P>
The specifics that U.S. negotiators want to nail down would enable American and 
other non-Japanese satellite makers to bid for purchases of commercial 
satellites by Japan's NHK television network for use in rebroadcast operations. 
</P>
<P>
Final details are expected to come in an exchange of letters between the two 
sides. The talks had been bogged down for months but were revived by the 
Japanese government after Bush and Kaifu specifically mentioned satellites at a 
meeting March 2-3 at Rancho Mirage.

Bechtel Reports Business Boom: The San Francisco-based engineering and 
construction giant said it signed up $5.4 billion in new projects during 1989, 
a six-year high and a 21% increase over 1988. Privately held Bechtel Group, 
which restructured last year, said that revenue performed and billed during 
1989 reached $5.1 billion, up 14% from the year before. Bechtel's revenue from 
such ongoing projects slid 52% from 1984 through 1988 before rising in 1989.

Digital Unveils Workstation Family: Digital Equipment Corp. introduced its new 
DECstation 5000, Model 200 desktop workstation and other products at a news 
conference in Palo Alto. However, DEC's latest entry does not match the speed 
of the aggressive line of RS/6000 workstations unveiled Feb. 16 by IBM. DEC 
executives downplayed the speed capabilities of the new workstation while 
promoting its memory, graphics capabilities and other features.

Executive Sues Mercury S&amp;L: Leonard Shane, the former chief executive of 
beleaguered Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, filed a federal suit against the 
thrift, seeking $850,000 plus interest in retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, 67, headed Mercury from April, 1964, through Feb. 23 of this year, when 
the Huntington Beach thrift was seized by federal regulators. Shane's suit, 
filed in U.S. District Court, claims that as chief executive, he was one of 
"certain key employees" who became entitled to retirement plan benefits. The 
lawsuit also lists the Resolution Trust Corp., which was named as conservator 
for Mercury when it was seized, as a defendant.

FORTUNE, FORBES RELEASE THEIR '500' LISTS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHING: BOTH RANKED GM AS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST FIRM AND COINCIDENTALLY 
MADE THEIR ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SAME DAY.

Fortune and Forbes magazines found one thing they could agree on Tuesday in 
their competitive lists of America's corporate titans. Both proclaimed General 
Motors Corp. the nation's largest public company. 
</P>
<P>
The Fortune 500 list, the annual ranking familiar on Main Street as well as 
Wall Street, ranked the nation's largest industrial firms by sales. The Forbes 
ranking included all public companies measured by sales, profit, assets and 
stock market value. 
</P>
<P>
Both magazines have issued 500 rankings for years, but this was the first time 
in recent memory that the lists were released the same day. In an effort to 
upstage its competitor, Forbes topped its rankings with the "Super 50" it 
considered the most powerful companies across all categories. 
</P>
<P>
GM was on top either way, with nearly $127 billion in sales and $4.2 billion in 
earnings during 1989 despite fierce foreign competition and cutthroat rebates 
that dampened business for all Big Three auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
The Fortune 500 overall also showed a profit decline in 1989 after years of 
strong growth, reflecting the slowdown in industrial America. 
</P>
<P>
Behind GM, the rest of Fortune's top 10 were: Ford Motor Co., Exxon Corp., 
International Business Machines Corp., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp., 
Philip Morris Co., Chrysler Corp., Du Pont Co. and Texaco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 10 of the Forbes Super 50 were: GE, Exxon, IBM, Ford, 
Philip Morris, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp., Mobil, Du Pont and 
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Fortune 500 list appears in the April 23 edition and will be available on 
newsstands beginning today. Forbes released its ranking two weeks before it is 
to hit the stands in the April 30 edition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a horse race every year," said Forbes spokesman Ray Healey, describing 
his magazine's rush to beat rival Fortune. 
</P>
<P>
But Marshall Loeb, Fortune managing editor, dismissed the competition: "Fortune 
has been at the 500 for years and years. It's part of the language. I've never 
heard anyone in conversation say, 'We're part of the Forbes 500.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fortune 500 sales jumped 7% to a record $2.16 trillion in 1989, but overall 
earnings fell 8.2% to $105.6 billion. In the previous two years, profits among 
the big manufacturers had climbed an unprecedented 79%. 
</P>
<P>
Median profit fell in nine of Fortune's 27 industry groups and only 264 of the 
top 500 companies had earnings growth, down from 327 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceuticals had the largest median increase in earnings, up 19.6%; followed 
by beverages, 18.3%; textiles, 15.3%; food, 14%, and electronics, 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicles and parts industry suffered the largest median earnings 
decline, down 25%, followed by aerospace, down 12.5%; petroleum refining, down 
11.8%; transportation equipment, down 9.4%, and computers, down 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune said six of the 10 largest industrial companies suffered double-digit 
earnings declines, including a 66% drop at Chrysler, whose ranking was dropped 
a notch from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1960s and 1970s, back before global competition became so intense and 
incessant, the earnings of the 500 companies invariably rose as long as the 
domestic economy was growing. Not any more," Fortune said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign competition, especially from the Japanese, was particularly fierce in 
the motor vehicles and parts industry, which ranked as the poorest performer by 
nearly every measure of profitability, according to Fortune. That sector also 
was hurt by high interest rates and rebates. 
</P>
<P>
GM had by far the largest profit during 1989, while No. 46 Sun Co., an energy 
resources business, had the biggest profit jump, up 1,300%. 
</P>
<P>
Maxxam Inc., an aluminum products and lumber company that soared to 184th place 
from 485th, had the biggest sales increase, up 366.7%, according to Fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Another big jump occurred due to Time Inc.'s acquisition of Warner 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
THE FORTUNE LIST 
</P>
<P>
Here are the top 25 companies on the Fortune 500, a ranking of the nation's 
largest industrial companies compiled by Fortune magazine on the basis of 1989 
sales.

Schering-Plough Sells Maybelline: Schering-Plough Corp., seeking to disentangle 
itself from the financially unpredictable beauty-products business, agreed to 
sell its Maybelline unit for $300 million to a group including the unit's 
management and Playtex Family Products Corp. Maybelline was placed on the 
auction block in December, as Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough was forced to 
bow to the fierce competitive forces shaping the global pharmaceutical 
business.

Simmons Won't Pursue Georgia Gulf: Investor Harold C. Simmons ended his 
$1.1-billion tender offer for Georgia Gulf Corp. and ended a planned proxy 
fight for control of the chemical company's board. A spokesman for Simmons' NL 
Industries Inc. said he will back a Georgia-Pacific recapitalization plan at 
its April 19 annual meeting. However, he said, NL -- which owns almost 10% of 
Georgia Gulf's stock -- may launch a new tender offer if shareholders reject 
the recapitalization plan.

A Finnish consumer affairs court banned a television advertisement for the 
fast-food chain McDonald's, saying it exploits the loneliness of a child, a 
court official said. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement shows a young boy unhappily surveying an empty apartment his 
parents apparently plan to move into. 
</P>
<P>
Despair turns to joy when he sees a McDonald's on the other side of the street, 
and the happy ending shows the boy eating in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the advertisement could give the impression McDonald's products 
could replace friends or lessen loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
It said the company could face a $50,000 fine if it used a child's loneliness 
to promote its products in a television advertisement again. 
</P>
<P>
In its response in court, McDonald's said the advertisement was part of its 
drive to present a visit to its restaurants as a family event and the role of 
McDonald's as a favorite eating spot for children in particular.

industries -- to imports in a move that could further stimulate that 
fast-growing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said this week in a brief announcement 
that Mexico will no longer require permits for computer imports. A tariff will 
be charged, but he did not specify the amount. The maximum Mexican import 
tariff now is 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The market opening, combined with simultaneously announced unspecified tax 
incentives for domestic producers, could help the Mexican computer market reach 
$3 billion by 1993, said Federico Ruiz Sacristan, president of Mexico's 
National Electronics Industry Chamber. That would be triple the current market. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate effect of trade liberalization will be a flood of low-priced 
imports into Mexico, predicted Nora Mosqueda, sales manager for CIGE, a 
distributor of Mexican-made Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mosqueda said she expects no negative effects from the new 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Companies already established in the Mexican market had anticipated the import 
policy change and have been dropping their prices over the past year to 
international levels as they introduced new products. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Mosqueda said, the old Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II printer sold 
for $3,450. The improved LaserJet III has a $3,020 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Most major U.S. companies, including Apple Computer and Unisys, have Mexican 
operations concentrated in the Guadalajara region. The new policy will allow 
those companies to import additional products not now available in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has carefully cultivated its computer industry, leaving computer 
products among the 3% of imports protected by permits. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic investment in the Mexican computer industry grew from $29 
million in 1983 to $84 million in 1988, the last year for which figures are 
available. Exports of Mexican computer products grew from nothing in 1978 to 
$175 million a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is aimed at encouraging further exports, Serra Puche said. 
</P>
<P>
"Incentives will be given to companies based on the domestic content of their 
products, their net investment in domestic assets and their expenditures on 
research and development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization combined with tax incentives will allow the entire country 
to take advantage of the best technology from all over the world while 
encouraging the domestic computer industry to find its place in the 
international market, he said.

PEOPLE: FEDERATED STORES CHOOSES 4 NEW DIRECTORS FOR BOARD

<P>
Federated Stores Inc., the parent of Ralphs Grocery Co. and such department 
store chains as Bloomingdale's, has named four independent directors to its 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the new directors are retired chief executives: Robert A. Charpie, the 
former chairman of Cabot Corp.; Reginald H. Jones, who headed General Electric 
Co., and John K. McKinley, who led Texaco Inc. The fourth new director is Lyle 
Everingham, the current chairman and chief executive of Kroger Co. 
</P>
<P>
Previously named to the board were four Federated Stores executives: G. William 
Miller, chairman and chief executive; Ronald W. Tysoe, president and chief 
operating officer; Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive of the 
company's two department store divisions, and Byron E. Allumbaugh, chairman and 
chief executive of Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
A new board was established for Federated Stores, the holding company for 
Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retailing interests, in January as part of a plan to 
restore the department store operations to financial health. The department 
store divisions, Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, filed for 
bankruptcy court protection on Jan. 15 in the biggest retailing bankruptcy in 
U.S. history. STUART SILVERSTEIN

INDICATORS TAKE STEEPEST DROP IN NINE MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
FORECAST: ANALYSTS BLAME A RECORD 25% DROP IN BUILDING PERMITS. BUT RESULTS CAN 
BE INTERPRETED AS INDICATIVE OF A SOFTER U.S. ECONOMY.

<P>
The government's main economic forecasting gauge plunged 1.0% in February, its 
steepest drop in nine months, the government said Tuesday. But analysts said 
the decrease was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that its latest index of leading economic 
indicators -- designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in 
advance -- wiped out three months of increases with the largest decline since a 
1.1% fall last May. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the report was an aberration caused by a record 25% drop in 
building permits in February from January's 26.8% gain when builders took 
advantage of warm weather and tried to beat deadlines for new government rules 
requiring easier access for the handicapped to new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been down just 0.2% without the distorting effect of the 
building permits," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; 
Co., a government securities dealer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said the 
gauge would bounce back next month to its levels of late 1989 and early 1990. 
The index rose 0.1% in November, 0.4% in December and 0.2% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, seven of the 11 statistics in the index were down, which analysts 
interpreted as meaning a soft economy, particularly in the manufacturing 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
"February's leading indicators show a substantial industrial rebound is 
unlikely to occur in the next six months," said William K. MacReynolds, 
forecasting director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones added, "Recent signals suggest that while the goods-producing sector 
is still flat, it's not getting any worse and there's no evidence that its 
weakness is spreading to other sectors." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to building permits, other statistics contributing to the index's 
decline in February were faster business delivery times, lower stock prices, a 
decline in plant and equipment orders, a decrease in the price of raw 
materials, a decline in the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders and a 
drop in an index measuring consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the components were positive, including an increase in orders for 
consumer goods, a gain in the money supply and a drop in weekly unemployment 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
One indicator, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 144.0% of its 1982 base of 100. The index 
fell 0.6% from September through February after declining 0.5% the previous six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Assn. of Manufacturers reported that the U.S. economy, 
increasingly subject to developments overseas, is likely to slow significantly 
later this year in response to higher interest rates in Germany and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But the industry group preducted a rapid rebound next year as the pending 
reunification of Germany and the transition by Warsaw Pact countries to market 
economies create a vast new market for U.S. exports to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
NAM President Jerry J. Jasinowski said the economies of the world's major 
nations have become so interconnected that major developments abroad often 
influence the U.S. economy more powerfully than domestic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski told a group of reporters that the key near-term economic event is 
likely to be next weekend's scheduled meeting in Paris of the finance ministers 
and central bankers of the seven major industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski said the United States should "assume a leadership role" in the 
so-called G-7 talks to stabilize exchange and interest rates and coordinate 
monetary policies. Besides the United States, the G-7 includes Britain, Canada, 
France, Italy, Japan and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, he said, should encourage a gradual rise in Japanese 
interest rates. That would bolster the faltering yen, he said, by attracting 
more foreign investment and would bring Japanese capital costs more in line 
with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Jasinowski said, U.S. officials should take steps to hold 
domestic interest rates steady or push them slightly lower to reduce the 
possibility of a recession during the second half of 1990.

* Vested Interest: Oliver North has entered into the bulletproof vest business 
with Joseph Fernandez, a former CIA station chief in Costa Rica who faced 
charges -- later dropped -- of obstructing inquiries into the Iran-Contra 
affair. In the company brochure, North says: "I rely every day on the . . . GTI 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
The comfort is unequalled, and . . . it provides the ultimate in body armor." 
</P>
<P>
* Playing Games: Gawkers and gamblers previewed Donald Trump's $1-billion Taj 
Mahal casino Monday in Atlantic City, N.J. Gamblers had to use play money for 
craps, blackjack and baccarat during a state-required period of test gaming. 
"It's Monday morning and it's raining and I don't think there is an empty 
machine to be had," said Trump. The casino officially opens Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
* News Watch: According to Newsweek magazine, George Bush likes to watch ABC's 
"World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings, switches to Dan Rather and likes Tom 
Brokaw the least. And he is said to have no love for cartoonist Garry Trudeau, 
for his years of ridicule, and columnist George Will, who once described Bush 
as a "lapdog." 
</P>
<P>
* Blind Date: Sony Corp. of America said Monday that it apologized to a 
customer for using Dec. 7 -- the date of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor -- as 
an example in an owner's manual explaining how to set the date on its 
videocassette recorders. Scott L. Edelheit had complained about the date, said 
Jason Farrow, a spokesman at Sony in Park Ridge, N.J. "It would be irrational 
for anyone to think that a company that does 25% of its business in the United 
States would ever intentionally do anything like that."

JACK SMITH: SPIRITED DEBATE OVER WHAT TO DO AFTER A QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My daughter-in-law's humanitarian foresight in adding a bottle of cognac to our 
earthquake kit has brought mixed comment about booze and disasters in general. 
</P>
<P>
Lois R. Koch of Santa Maria doubts that a snifter of the genuine French article 
would sharpen my senses in dealing with the emergencies caused by the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
"Just how aware and in contact with what is going on around you would you be 
with the liquor in your system?" she asks. "I assume during and after an 
earthquake you would want your senses to be as sharp as they could be so you 
could deal with whatever situation you are in." 
</P>
<P>
There is no argument against Mrs. Koch's thesis. One ought to face up to any 
emergency sober. However, I think she goes too far in her interdiction: 
</P>
<P>
"I have admonished you before about your liking for a drink in order to enjoy 
the view, the country or whatever else you are doing at the moment. . . . 
Because I think so much of you I want you to be in total control in any given 
emergency or difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
Still, I can hardly ignore that sort of concern, and I promise Mrs. Koch that 
when the Big One comes I won't touch the cognac until after my wife has shut 
off the gas valve and taken whatever other security measures one must take. 
</P>
<P>
As for Jay L. Ambrose's recollection that during the 1921 Pueblo (Colorado) 
flood the government passed out free bourbon to its victims, I am corrected in 
my assumption that, since Prohibition was then the law of the land, and 
distilling spirits was illegal, the government must have drawn on confiscated 
supplies of contraband. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, according to Lawrence S. Dietz, whose father was in the business; when 
Prohibition came in, many distillers had large stocks of bottled-in-bond 
spirits in warehouses labeled "for medical purposes only." Rather than put such 
valuable public assets to the ax, our humane bureaucrats saved them for such 
disasters as Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Edward J. Costello recalls that he was a 6-year-old in Pueblo when the 
flood struck. "At the age of 6, there was no reason why I should have been 
aware of the suspension of Prohibition for the 30-day period. Yet, for me, 
there is an odd twist to this unusual moratorium. The story was that for many 
weeks after the flood there was no potable water available, and the workers 
involved in the cleanup were forced to drink whatever was available while on 
the job. Some years later my father was forced to resign from the Santa Fe 
because of a 'drinking problem' and the family came to believe that it all 
began with the aftermath of the flood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Surely that sad tale reflects the wisdom of Mrs. Koch's warning. 
</P>
<P>
Dirck Z. Meengs of Westlake Village recalls that the distillation of whiskey 
and other spirits "for medicinal purposes" was allowed during Prohibition. 
Small amounts could be obtained from drug stores by prescription. (Doctors must 
have been as much in demand as bootleggers.) 
</P>
<P>
Even after Prohibition ended, Meengs says, "my father's parishioners would 
explain the presence of alcohol in their homes during his visits as being 'for 
medicinal purposes only,' accompanied by a sly grin." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Seibert of San Francisco reports that on Oct. 17, 1989, at 5:04 p.m., 
she was stranded in the underground at Powell Street Station. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the first aftershock, at approximately 5:45 p.m., I was poured three 
glasses of Chandon Brut in The Compass Rose in the lobby of the Hotel St. 
Francis on Powell Street. I was not charged for the champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"Moses, a gentleman patron of The Compass Rose, had told me on a previous 
occasion that the room had survived the fire/quake of 1906. With the help of 
the Chandon Brut, we survived the aftershock nicely that day also." 
</P>
<P>
You see, in San Francisco they know what to do after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of her letter, Mrs. Seibert notes that she sent a copy of it to 
Herb Caen, the bard of the San Francisco Chronicle. I'm sure it didn't tell him 
anything he didn't already know. 
</P>
<P>
I must confess that after I discovered the cognac in our earthquake kit, I 
opened it and took a snort just before retiring. Helps one sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Surely Mrs. Koch can't have any objections to that.

SCREEN STYLE: A HAIR AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE MOVIE: "House Party" 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Bright, bouncy and decidedly youthful. Hip Hop rapper duo Kid 'N Play 
(Kid -- Christoper Reid -- and Play -- Christoper Martin) get busy in this 
kinetic teen-buddy comedy shot for chump change. 
</P>
<P>
THE STAR VEHICLE: The filmmakers spent their meager money wisely, and in the 
process have introduced a new star: Kid's towering head of hair -- a 
fez-shaped, totally tubular creation with shaved sides. The exceptional do was 
maintained through the movie by stylist Byron Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAN: Centerpiece of this raucous and soulful flick is the party referred 
to in the title. Play (of Kid 'N Play) has his crib all to himself when the 
folks foolishly leave town. Play intends to play indeed so he arranges the 
party of the year. Kid, along with his hair, has been grounded by Pop for the 
evening but he slinks out later to make the scene. The party is big and the 
beats blare. The outfits are even louder. 
</P>
<P>
THE STYLE: Rookie director Reginald Hudlin instructed the film's costumer, 
Harold Evans, to give him a "comic book" look. "We used as much color as we 
could and spread it around," explained Evans. Red. Lime. Purple. The party 
would look brightly lit even in a blackout -- gold chains, earrings and knuckle 
strips abound. The gyrating throngs are nattily clad, Play wears a beige suit 
with a turquoise collar, Sharane (A. J. Johnson) is attired in a tight yellow 
thigh-length outfit topped with a small red jacket. To start his big day, Kid 
wakes up in bright white pj's with a multicolored geometric print. 
</P>
<P>
THE STORES: Evans created some of the outfits himself and procured the rest at 
the Beverly Center and local department stores Bullock's and Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: "We tried to keep him colorful," says Evans. The young man's shirt 
was iridescent gray silk and emanated tones of reds and blues. Was it a name 
brand? "It wasn't that type of show," laughs Evans, whose wardrobe budget could 
fit into a thimble. 
</P>
<P>
THE PAYOFF: A statement-making personal style doesn't necessarily mean an 
expensive wardrobe. As in the case of "House Party" a terrific 'do will do.

ABC's telecast of the Academy Awards helped propel the network to first place 
in the Nielsen ratings last week, breaking NBC's string of 23 consecutive 
triumphs. NBC still placed six shows in the Top 10 and finished second overall, 
ahead of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also got strong performances from the Barbara Walters special that aired in 
conjunction with the Academy Awards and from its new series "Equal Justice," 
which won its time period on Wednesday. NBC's new comedy "Carol &amp; Company," 
starring Carol Burnett, did even better in its first time out on Saturday, 
placing ninth among the week's 84 prime-time programs. The full list of ratings 
is on F9. 
</P>
<P>
* It was a good week for series premieres. The CBS comedy "Bagdad Cafe," 
starring Jean Stapleton and Whoopi Goldberg, won its Friday night time slot 
(knocking off ABC's "Perfect Strangers"), as did the show that premiered in its 
wake, "Sugar &amp; Spice." CBS said that "Bagdad Cafe" turned in the best 
ratings the network has received between 9 and 9:30 on a Friday night this 
season.

Say Innocent: Actor John Cusack, star of the movie "Say Anything," pleaded 
innocent Tuesday in Beverly Hills to two drunken-driving charges stemming from 
a collision with another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Because the charge is a misdemeanor, Cusack, 23, of Beverly Hills, was not 
required to be in court for his arraignment. Instead, he entered his plea 
through his attorney, Michael Chaney. Cusack, who remains without bail, faces a 
May 4 pretrial hearing. BETH KLEID

ANDERSON'S VOCAL STYLE IS WORTH A BETTER HEARING THAN HE GIVES IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN

<DATELINE>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Anderson is far too young to be acting as if he's one of country's 
grizzled warhorses, but so he seemed, for better and worse, in his early show 
Monday evening at the Crazy Horse Steak House and Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Like Willie Nelson and other vets, Anderson has carved his own vocal niche in 
country with an almost-quirky style that makes him immediately recognizable. 
But, even more like Nelson, his 20-song show was practically running on 
autopilot. His performance was never less than solid and workmanlike, but it 
was rarely more than that; one got the impression that it wasn't a show 
Anderson is going to remember through the years. 
</P>
<P>
He opened with his early hit, "Black Sheep of the Family," and closed the 
pre-encore set with the early-'80s breakthrough hit, "Swingin'." Between them 
he stuck to the tried and true, ignoring most of his recent songs from 1989's 
"Too Tough to Tame" and the previous year's "10." 
</P>
<P>
But while there were few surprises in the song selection, his voice was full of 
little revelations. Anderson has a plaintive, almost pinched voice that is 
distinctive enough, but it is his use of dynamics that is unique, the way his 
voice fades in and out of hearing in the oddest places. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing him live, it becomes obvious that this is not so much the product of his 
vocal cords as it is from his microphone technique, with his head flinching 
away from the mike several times during each line of a song. It is no mere 
novelty, though, as Anderson's Morse code vocal dropouts seemed to be keyed by 
his emotions. On the troubled ballad "Down in Tennessee" or his encore "Yellow 
Creek" -- dealing with the Cherokee Indians' Trail of Tears -- his voice, and 
that sudden lack of it, was a powerful conduit of feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Just as often, though, he delivered rote versions of standards, with the effort 
of staying tuned to his here-and-gone voice bringing scant reward. It was 
indeed an effort, because at most points the sound mix had his voice submerged 
below practically every instrument in his six-piece band. Perhaps the sound man 
figured that everyone had come to hear the bass player, as the moments were few 
when Anderson's voice prevailed in the speakers. Those came only when he put 
his voice into overdrive, as on the raucous "Let Somebody Else Drive" and a 
powerfully rendered "Peace in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
If all the performances in his set had been as involved, it might have been a 
tremendous show. But in addition to toss-off versions of "I'm Just an Old Chunk 
of Coal" and other songs, Anderson chose to clutter the set with two banjo 
instrumentals. He was competent on the instrument, but so is the guy in the 
cabin on the "Pirates of the Caribbean" ride.

UITTI, BESSETTE AT COUNTY MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back-to-back solo recitals by two outstanding musicians brought intelligence 
and uncompromising virtuosity to the latest Monday Evening Concert at Bing 
Theater, County Museum of Art. Frances-Marie Uitti -- an American-born cellist 
who now resides in Holland -- and Canadian pianist Louise Bessette shared the 
intimate event, pleasingly shedding light on some lesser-known 20th-Century 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
With an expressionless, markedly poised approach, Uitti unravelled the snarly 
serial architecture of Iannis Xenakis' "Kottos"(1978), lucidly deciphering a 
montage of technically difficult glissando maneuvers and roughly hewn tremolos. 
Similarly fascinating and painstakingly executed was the odd mix of sonic 
exploration and ethnic elements in "Curve With Plateaux" (1981) by English 
composer Jonathan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Uitti's own slowly unfolding, droning Ricercar (1990) demonstrates her 
inventive technique of achieving four-part harmony by using two bows, though 
little else. A read-through of Roger Sessions' atonal Six Pieces for Cello Solo 
(1966) proceeded cautiously, but competently. 
</P>
<P>
The only collaboration between the two, Morton Feldman's note-upon-note 
pianissimo study "Durations II" (1960), blended the two talents adequately, 
though lacking adventure in context with the overall ambitious programing. 
Otherwise, an impressively sturdy technique and prowess steered Bessette's 
opening half of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Gilles Tremblay's piano concoction "Tracantes . . . aupres, au loin . . . " 
(1976) assorts loud tremolos and fast xylophone-like melodic lines that 
contrast abruptly with resonating sympathetic vibrations achieved by silently 
depressing keys. Bessette masterfully melded the diverse elements, relishing 
each moment while displaying a deep understanding of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
Giacinto Scelsi's busy Sonata No. 4 for piano (1941) explored rich, eccentric 
regions of homophony and neo-Classicism. Three early piano pieces by Henry 
Cowell proved attractive exercises for the fingers, not to mention forearms, 
fists and palms.GREGG WAGER

<P>
Pianist Leon Fleisher will conduct and appear as soloist with the Pacific 
Symphony on May 23 and 24 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher replaces Sergiu Comissiona, who bowed out of the engagement to assume 
his new duties as music director for the Vancouver Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Fleisher was already scheduled to appear on those dates as soloist in Ravel's 
Concerto for the Left Hand. He will conduct that work from the keyboard and

A TASTY MIX OF SIN, SALVATION IN 'MOMMA DON'T' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's difficult to ignore a show where Jesus Christ is billed as executive 
producer, especially when the credit is not a put-on. And the black touring 
gospel musical "Momma Don't" (as in "Momma, find the Lord, and lay off the 
crack cocaine") is not a show you can dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
Sophisticates may blink, but a packed house at the opening Sunday at the 
Wilshire Ebell found the cornucopia of hookers, drugs, pimps, a church choir, 
murder and resurrection irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to write about a production like this is as a news report. Who 
cares if the musical is overbaked, overripe, over-the-top, overlong? This show 
is connecting. The only white person in the house was a reviewer, and he got 
impatient with the message about the savior curing addiction, but he had a good 
time too. 
</P>
<P>
That's because writer-director-producer Michael Matthews doesn't take things 
too seriously. He's not one to pass up a laugh, and there are plenty in the 
show, especially in the outrageous costumes of the ladies of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews has been booking this show into big houses back East since last May, 
and he has enjoyed success with a highly promotable idea: in each city, the 
show features a romping, stomping local church choir. Here, it's the Greater 
Bethany Mass Choir. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody ever underestimated the box-office clout of sin and salvation, and this 
show's strategy draws heavily from black church groups. The production's strong 
suit is the pit orchestra, under Kenny Jackson's raucous musical direction, and 
the vocalizing -- featuring, among others, the gospel trio the Clark Sisters. 
Comedically, the nominal stars are Akosua Busia and Ernest Harden Jr.. Busia, 
spilling out of her lipstick red fringe dress, is riotous. 
</P>
<P>
When pistols go off, the whiff of the powder wafts over the house. There's even 
a coffin with the body of a prostitute stretched out in it. As the reverend 
says, "She was an upstanding member of the community. She was always standing 
around a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 At 4401 W. 8th St., Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., Saturdays and Sunday, 3 
p.m., through April 14. $18.50-$25.50. (213) 939-1128.

THE JUGGERNAUT ROLLS ON AT GRAND AVE. BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Capp-Pierce Juggernaut, launching a series of Monday night big band at the 
Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, drew a heavy and happy crowd, defying 
competition from the televised NCAA men's basketball finals. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment pianist Nat Pierce eased into a medium tempo blues in a Basie 
groove, with the mood accentuated by the rhythm guitar pulse of John Pisano, 
the Juggernaut took off like the inexorable force for which it is named. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every number was a judicious mixture of tightly-meshed ensembles, biting 
brass passages and occasional section interludes, such as the five-sax soli 
passage on "In A Mellotone," a tune that revealed every horn player in the band 
as a soloist of the first rank. 
</P>
<P>
The two tenor saxes, doing battle on Neal Hefti's "Whirly Bird," offered a 
study in contrast: Bob Shepard a little more hollow in sound than Rickey 
Woodard, but both in full improvisatory command. There were suitable solo 
openings for all three trombonists -- Slide Hyde, in an elegant examination of 
"A Time for Love," Buster Cooper in his bumble bee impression, and Thurman 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
Other bright moments were offered by Bill Berry's muted cornet on "Open All 
Night" and, of course, the potently supportive drumming of Frank Capp 
throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
A maverick chart was Bob Florence's "Slime House," a bristling work that was 
entirely ensemble, sans solos -- proof, as if it were needed, that 
extemporization is not necessarily the lifeblood of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would be wishful thinking to claim that big bands are back, it is 
true that occasional local one-nighters such as this are capable of attracting 
loyalists to the swinging sounds of a 16-member powerhouse. Next Monday: the 
Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra. LEONARD FEATHER

SIKH GROUP BOMBS HINDU PARADE; 32 DIE

<TEXT>
<P>
Sikh extremists set off a bomb near a Hindu religious procession in Punjab on 
Tuesday, killing at least 32 people and triggering clashes between the two 
communities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer died and five were injured as they tried to quell the unrest, 
and 15 more people were killed in violence elsewhere in Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a procession of 14,000 Hindus, celebrating the birthday of their 
deity Rama, had reached a crowded vegetable market in Batala when the bomb went 
off on a bicycle or scooter. 
</P>
<P>
S. S. Channi, deputy commissioner of Gurdaspur district, imposed an indefinite 
curfew on Batala, an industrial town of 100,000 people in the north of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the blast was almost certainly the work of the Khalistan Commando 
Force, Babbar Khalsa and the Khalistan Liberation Force -- a powerful new 
coalition of extremist groups fighting for an independent homeland in Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
They said shrapnel from the bomb killed 10 people in the procession including a 
5-year-old girl watching it with her parents. At least 50 others were taken to 
the hospital with serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's mother was among 15 others who died at a Batala hospital shortly 
afterward. Seven more of the injured were sent for care 21 miles to the Sikh 
holy city of Amritsar, where they died. 
</P>
<P>
After the blast, Hindus rampaged through the market trying to set fire to 
vehicles and shops owned by Sikhs. 
</P>
<P>
Police fired in the air to enforce the curfew and to control fighting that had 
broken out between the two groups, senior police Supt. S. K. Goyal said. 
</P>
<P>
Goyal said one police officer was killed and five were injured in the clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Hindus are targets of the extremist campaign in Punjab, in which some 670 
people have died this year alone as Sikhs battle for a homeland they call 
Khalistan -- Land of the Pure. 
</P>
<P>
Sikhs are in a majority in Punjab but make up only 16 million of India's total 
population of 829 million, of which most are Hindus.

An estimated 500 million people will die from smoking in the next 25 years, 
according to a World Health Organization study released here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
WHO statistician Dr. Alan Lopez and Richard Peto, an epidemics expert at 
Britain's Oxford University, said at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health 
that their study indicates smoking will be the No. 1 cause of death in the 
world by the turn of the century, making tobacco a bigger potential killer than 
AIDS.

After nearly 11 years of reviewing Japanese films in a weekly column for the 
Asahi Evening News, critic Alan Booth threw in the towel last December with a 
one-word verdict on the latest Godzilla movie: 
</P>
<P>
"Monstrous." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to pan the state of contemporary Japanese cinema. Booth, a trenchant 
British writer who first came to Japan in 1970 to study noh drama, confessed he 
enjoyed only a couple dozen of the 510 Japanese movies he had reviewed. A mere 
handful had been "memorable." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, buying a ticket and going into a cinema has been a chore, 
not a pleasure," Booth wrote. "In all honesty, I think that a weekly review of 
Japanese films is an unnecessarily promiscuous use of recycled rain forest 
timber." 
</P>
<P>
Such peevishness may seem at odds with the international reputation of Japan's 
classic cinema. Only the other day, Hollywood paid homage to one of the great 
Japanese directors -- the venerable Akira Kurosawa, 80, creator of "Rashomon," 
"Seven Samurai" and "Ran" -- with an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement. 
</P>
<P>
But from the vantage point of the theater seat in Tokyo, Kurosawa and his ilk 
are phantoms of the past. The Japanese motion picture industry is now at its 
nadir, starving for good scripts, stifling creativity with miserly production 
budgets and churning out a lot of trashy movies that rarely make much money. 
</P>
<P>
Consider last year's No. 1 box office hit, "Kiki's Delivery Service," which 
pulled in about $35 million in ticket sales. This was an animated film about a 
clumsy adolescent witch who delivers packages by broomstick. Animator Hayao 
Miyazaki lumped dirigibles with television sets in an oddly incoherent European 
landscape, where signs at the boulangerie are written in Japanese characters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cartoon's conceptual flaws, Miyazaki's fable about the rite of 
passage into teen-age self-confidence still managed to outshine most the rest 
of the domestic film industry's 1989 crop, at least in terms of screenplay and 
production quality. And Kiki's acting was arguably more realistic than the 
melodramatic outbursts of her human colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is it that contemporary Japan is so advanced economically, but has so few 
serious movies to show the world its culture?" asked Kazuko Komori, a veteran 
film critic and James Dean fanatic who visits her idol's grave in Indiana every 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of foreign films, so when I review a Japanese production I've got 
to lower my standards drastically," said Komori, 81, who wore gold tights and 
pancake makeup during a recent interview at the "movie cafe" she runs in 
Tokyo's Roppongi entertainment district. "The scripts are so bad to begin with 
(that) there's not much you could do, even with the best of actors." 
</P>
<P>
Japan's most prestigious film of 1989 was "Black Rain" (Kuroi Ame), in which 
director Shohei Imamura ministers over an agonizing, sentimental adaptation of 
Masuji Ibuse's classic novel about a family's suffering caused by the atomic 
bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Rain" swept the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Awards, garnered two 
prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and drew enthusiastic audiences in Paris and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, the movie's cinematographic style -- grainy black and white -- is a 
throwback to the 1950s. The viewer looks back with nostalgia to the "golden 
era" of Japanese cinema, when directors like Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi and 
Yasujiro Ozu attracted international acclaim -- and Imamura himself did some of 
his better work. 
</P>
<P>
Although the A-bomb melodrama was an artistic success, it put on a flat 
performance at the box office. "Kiki," the colorful cartoon movie, took in 27 
times more in receipts than "Black Rain." But the little witch earned only half 
as much as the top imported film of last year, the latest Indiana Jones 
installment, according to the trade magazine Kinema Jumpo. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be a little crazy to make quality feature films in Japan," Imamura 
said the other day. "My work may have a high artistic reputation, but I don't 
make any money at this. I'm not starving, but I have lots of debts." 
</P>
<P>
Imamura, 63, lives on a modest salary from a filmmaking school he founded. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while independent producer-directors like Imamura are struggling to 
raise cash for their films, a surge of Japanese capital is now flowing into 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Sony Corp. raised xenophobic hackles about "buying the soul of 
America" with its $3.4-billion takeover of Columbia Pictures. Sony's avowed aim 
was to satisfy an itch for American software to complement its formidable 
hardware capabilities in VCR technology and high-definition television. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, another major electronics maker, Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. (JVC), 
invested more than $100 million last year in a new U.S. film production 
company, Largo Entertainment. JVC had earlier funded director Jim Jarmusch's 
"Mystery Train" -- starring a young Japanese couple in search of Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
Such corporate largess has so far eluded Japan's most reputable filmmakers. 
Kurosawa, for one, has been forced to go outside the Japanese industry to 
finance his films for nearly two decades. At home, his genius is considered too 
expensive -- and too risky. 
</P>
<P>
Juzo Itami, the satirical master who directed "Tampopo" and "The Taxing Woman," 
had to mortgage his house to finance his first film. Luckily, it was a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"A film like 'Seven Samurai' could never be made today," said Haruo Mizuno, 
prominent film critic and loquacious TV movie host. "The great directors can't 
make movies anymore because producers are afraid they'll have no control over 
how much money they'd spend. As a result, there's no big work being done in 
Japan, only small work." 
</P>
<P>
Mizuno speculates that "a lack of social tension" is partly to blame for a kind 
of creative bankruptcy among today's younger screenwriters and directors. It 
was no accident that the "golden era" of film coincided with the turbulent 
years of the postwar period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But money -- or the lack of it -- undoubtedly is a key to the artistic tailspin 
that Japanese cinema went into precisely about the time Kurosawa started going 
abroad to finance his films. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of television, Japan became a nation of what might be called 
"tatami potatoes" (tatami are the straw mats covering the floors of traditional 
homes). Movie fans abandoned the big screen and stayed home to watch their 
televisions and, later, VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
The movie market peaked in 1958, when Japanese bought 1.3 billion cinema 
tickets. Last year attendence was down to 143.5 million -- 13% of the peak -- 
and only 1,912 movie houses remained in business. 
</P>
<P>
Pinched by the loss of revenues, the major movie studios have almost entirely 
gotten out of the business of producing feature films and diversified into such 
enterprises as pornographic videos, bowling alleys, real estate and off-track 
bicycle-race betting. 
</P>
<P>
In a few cases, companies outside the entertainment industry have stepped in to 
underwrite film projects, with dubious results. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious example of this genre was "Dun Huang," an extravaganza 
period drama filmed along the Silk Road in China with thousands of horses and 
extras in battle regalia arrayed across the desert. The heroes of "Dun Huang" 
emoted by screaming their lines at the tops of their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
The $40-million production took in about $30 million in film rentals in 1988, a 
"big hit" in Japan but apparently a disappointment as an investment -- despite 
aggressive ticket sales campaigns by two of its corporate backers, Marubeni 
Corp., the trading company, and Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dun Huang' was childish, below the lowest common denominator, a lousy 
picture -- and everybody knew it from the beginning," said Donald Richie, the 
former film curator at New York's Museum of Modert Art and one of the foremost 
authorities on Japanese film. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Silk Road saga signaled a new direction for the film industry. C. Itoh 
&amp; Co., another major trading house, helped finance last year's "Rikyu," a 
lavish, dull production about a 16th Century tea master and his samurai 
political entanglements. Hiroshi Teshigahara, a star avant-garde director of 
the 1960s, returned from 17 years of silence to make the film. Theaters filled 
up largely because tea-ceremony and flower-arranging societies hawked tickets, 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
How Japanese corporate cash will behave in Hollywood will be a matter of keen 
interest. Although Sony has vowed to take a hands-off approach to managing its 
new studio, Richie is skeptical about the Japanese company's ability to resist 
the temptation to meddle. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the genius of the Japanese is to never take their hands off things, 
to always be tinkering and making it better," he said. "Will they (Sony 
executives) start giving orders? I can't imagine them not. I can't imagine any 
boss not giving orders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the anthropology of bad movies, Japan is a field worker's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, Japanese films dissected small-town electoral 
corruption ("Conditions of a Virtuous Man"), transplanted the "Rocky" boxing 
myth to a seedy section of Osaka ("Dotsuitaru-nen!"), illuminated the stinking 
internal politics of a big newspaper ("Corporate Funeral"), offered a guided 
tour to heaven -- and hell -- by an actor famous for playing gangsters ("The 
Great Spirit World") and proved that the murderous leaders of a failed 1936 
military coup were really sappy, sentimental family men ("Four Days of Snow and 
Blood"). 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate in Japanese cinema kitsch is the "Tora-san" series, a maudlin 
comic drama that Japanese have been returning to every summer and winter for 21 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Director Yoji Yamada has racked up 42 installments so far of "It's Tough to Be 
a Man," a mark in the Guinness Book of World Records that not even India's 
prolific filmmakers seem close to challenging. The films are so safe that they 
are among the few still being produced by a major studio. (Each installment 
earns Shochiku Co. about $10 million in film rentals.) Kiyoshi Atsumi stars as 
Torajiro Kuruma, or Tora-san, the wandering peddler who strikes a chord in the 
nation's heart because he is so carefree, unattached and independent -- 
characteristics that are exactly the antithesis of socially prescribed values. 
Tora-san is the inverse image of Japan's group-oriented, sacrificing Everyman. 
</P>
<P>
Until last January's No. 42 in the series, each film had the same aging cast of 
characters and basically the same plot: Tora-san returns from his travels to a 
long-suffering family, falls in love with a new woman, gets rejected, passes 
her on to a rival, then takes to the road again. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing these films should be like wearing an old shirt," said Yamada, 
Tora-san's creator, scriptwriter and director. "People go to the theater to 
meet Tora-san, like a friend." 
</P>
<P>
There are signs now that the nostalgic ritual is finally winding down. In the 
latest film, Tora-san's nephew takes the lead, while he steps back into an 
avuncular supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Tora-san formula work so well isn't entirely clear to Yamada, 
but that doesn't stop him from being philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
"Tora-san doesn't like to ride the bullet train -- it goes so fast it leaves 
his spirit behind. He prefers to walk," Yamada said in an interview. "The 
Japanese have forgotten something in their hurry to advance. Tora-san is going 
back and picking up what we've lost, so we can go forward."

'FANTASIA' DRAWING AUCTIONED IN BURBANK FOR RECORD $4,300 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A drawing from the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence of Walt Disney's 
"Fantasia" (1940) sold for $4,300 at an auction in Burbank Monday night, 
believed to be a record for an animation drawing. 
</P>
<P>
The 11x15-inch drawing featured a large image of Tchernabog, the black god of 
Ukrainian folklore, rendered in red, orange, blue and black pencil by animator 
Vladimir (Bill) Tytla. Critics rank Tytla's animation of Tchernabog among the 
finest work ever done at the Disney studio. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 261 lots in the sale conducted by animation art dealer Howard Lowery at 
the Burbank Hilton, 253 found buyers, for a total of $368,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the works in the auction were the black-and-white cel and 
background set-ups from the early Disney shorts that command six-figure prices 
in New York, the sale confirmed both the importance of the West Coast market 
for animation art and the stability of prices for cels, drawings, backgrounds 
and preliminary artwork in the $500 to $4,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Cels from the Disney features constituted the bulk of the material in the sale, 
but bidding was brisk for drawings and artwork from other cartoon studios, 
notably MGM. A cel and background set-up from Tex Avery's "One Cab's Family" 
(MGM, 1952) brought $4,700, while 27 assorted drawings from six Avery shorts 
sold for $1,700, considerably higher than the pre-sale estimate of $800-$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
A cel and background of Chilly Willy and the nasty dog from Walter Lantz's "The 
Legend of Rockabye Point" (1955) brought $850. A cel of John Lennon dressed as 
a member of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band from George Dunning's 
"Yellow Submarine" (1968) sold for $2,400, double its estimated price of 
$900-$1,200. In 1968, cels from "Yellow Submarine" were sold in bookstores for 
$2 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Some pretty fabulous animation was created at the Walter Lantz, Warner Bros. 
and MGM studios," said Lowery. "As people become exposed to their films, 
artwork from these studios will continue to rise in value."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: BORIS BARE: THE END OF A STEREOTYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will the real Boris stand up? This glasnost business is getting perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
For years we knew exactly who the Soviets were. We saw them in movies and on 
television, saw them in commercials, saw them depicted as shapeless women in 
boots and babushkas or as thick-necked brutes with bald heads. They were at 
once objects of our fear and the butts of our jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Inaccurately calling all of them Russians instead of Soviets, we viewed them as 
a monolith with a single identity, not as a culturally and ethnically complex 
hybrid consisting of various republics, of which Russia was merely the largest 
and most influential. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet stereotype was habit-forming as well as easy and comfortable. For 
many, blindness was bliss. 
</P>
<P>
But look what has happened. With the relative openness of Gorbachev's glasnost 
have come infinite fresh images of a Soviet Union in transformation, and with 
them confusion, because some of these images not only clash with the old images 
but also with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On KCET, Huell Howser's inexpensive camcorder captures a broad cross 
section of Moscow citizens who are so warm and friendly that you want to reach 
right through the screen and embrace them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are continuing stories of Soviet anti-Semitism. Plus newscast after 
newscast bring pictures of Soviet armor ominously rumbling through Vilnius in a 
show of might intended to bully once-autonomous Lithuania into backing away 
from its pronouncement of independence from the Soviet Union. CBS News 
predicts: "The stranglehold of Soviet power will soon be felt." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A "Frontline" program on PBS goes behind the scenes of a Miss U.S.S.R. 
beauty pageant, finding controversy and pretty contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On CBS, "60 Minutes" follows a group of Australian and American tourists 
having less than a wonderful time visiting Yalta, a Soviet seaside resort in 
the Ukraine. The many Soviet male and female sunbathers showed on camera have 
bodies that can be described, charitably, as gargantuan mounds of blubber. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Academy Awards come to the Soviet Union. Among foreign cities connected 
by satellite to ABC's Oscar telecast is Moscow, where visible in the hall among 
celebrities in the background is Yakov Smirnoff, a stand-up comic in the United 
States whose jokes ridicule his homeland's communism. 
</P>
<P>
The perspectives grow in diversity and number. 
</P>
<P>
And "Voices of Leningrad" -- airing at 8 tonight on Channels 28, 50 and 15 -- 
is yet another perspective, a "National Geographic" special merging the 
powerful currents of Russian and Soviet history into a single golden hour that 
monitors changes in the city that narrator Theodore Bikel calls "a majesty of 
space and sky, water and stone." 
</P>
<P>
Written and produced by Miriam Birch, "Voices of Leningrad" is majesty in 
documentary filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad was first St. Petersburg, an elegant, European-style city of graceful 
buildings, palaces, parks and canals that Czar Peter the Great founded in 1703 
as old Russia's door to the West. It was renamed for Lenin following the 1917 
Russian revolution that toppled the monarchy and ultimately elevated the 
Bolsheviks to power. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Leningrad somehow managed to endure a 900-day German siege 
that killed 25% of its population. One of those who didn't perish is now on the 
screen. He's the director of the splendorous State Hermitage Museum, and he 
shows off the museum's bomb shelter that was his home and office during the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
As this program so eloquently demonstrates, the city's great physical beauty 
survives even today in sharp contrast to the futility and grim shabbiness of 
the revolution that began there and dramatically altered history. 
</P>
<P>
We see a Soviet couple and their son shop for groceries. The store they shop in 
is a handsome relic from earlier times. The problem is that it contains few 
goods. Just the same, the lines for those few goods are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, evangelical Christians sell their faith on the steps of an ancient 
church, a TV reporter is regarded as heroic for reporting candidly about the 
city's homeless, a rock singer wails about the miseries of the Afghanistan war 
and, in the most stunningly luminous segment of all, the camera records a 
12-year-old ballerina and her classmates dancing in the footsteps of Pavlova, 
Nijinsky and Baryshnikov at what is now the Vaganova State Choreographic 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
There is awe and wonder on her small face, in contrast to the worry and 
skepticism of many of her adult countrymen as they face the sacrifices and 
uncertainties of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
What gleaming work this program is, and how long it has taken Americans to hear 
and comprehend the diversity of voices that sound here and elsewhere in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Will the real Boris stand up? He's doing it -- all of them are doing it -- now.

CLEAN AIR ACT REVISIONS PASSED BY SENATE, 89-11; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE COMPROMISE MEASURE BREAKS A 10-YEAR IMPASSE AND WOULD IMPOSE 
TOUGH NEW CONTROLS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate, bridging a decade-old division between economic and environmental 
interests, approved Tuesday a sweeping revision of the Clean Air Act that would 
impose tough new pollution controls to make the air in all U.S. cities fit to 
breathe by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The far-reaching and intensely controversial bill, the first revision of the 
nation's clean air laws since 1977, was adopted by a vote of 89 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
The House is still drafting its own version of the bill, with floor action not 
expected until next month. But while some of the fierce battles that almost 
derailed the Senate bill are likely to be refought on the House floor, 
supporters of the legislation said it was now all but certain that a new Clean 
Air Act would be signed into law this year. 
</P>
<P>
Senate passage was considered a major victory for Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who fought for years to bring clean air legislation to the 
floor and who helped craft a complex compromise proposal with the Bush 
Administration last month. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, however, has been strongly criticized by both environmental and 
business interests. Industry lobbyists contend it goes too far in imposing 
financial burdens on businesses and environmentalists maintain it does not go 
far enough to ensure its avowed aim of protecting public health. 
</P>
<P>
Business lobbyists predicted the bill would cost many billions of dollars more 
to implement than the Administration has estimated and said it could result in 
severe economic upheavals and the loss of at least 200,000 jobs in the 
industries hardest hit by the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said the concessions made to win White House support for the 
bill had left it riddled with loopholes. "This is no longer a bill that will 
achieve its aim of protecting public health or cleaning up the nation's air," 
said Richard Ayres, director of the National Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental lobbying coalition. 
</P>
<P>
California environmental officials said they were disappointed because the 
changes negotiated by the White House left them without strong federal backup 
for the much tougher clean air regulations either already in effect or being 
planned for the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill does not preclude us from carrying out our own plans, but to the 
extent that it could have extended those goals to the rest of the country, it 
would have made it much easier for us," said Bill Sessa, an official with the 
California Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the compromise, Mitchell said the Senate faced only two choices: 
"This clean air bill or no clean air bill." This bill, he added, "dramatically 
expands and strengthens" existing law in "the most cost efficient manner 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One before the Senate vote, Bush said 
that in the clean air effort, "We are not going to go to either extreme: the 
extreme of throwing people out of work and shutting down America and stopping 
all economic growth, or the extreme of doing nothing about the terribly 
pressing environmental questions." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke during a flight from Indiana to Michigan, during a day of political 
speeches at fund-raising events in Indianapolis and Dearborn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Considered perhaps the most important and complicated legislation that Congress 
is likely to pass this year, the omnibus bill tightens a number of controls on 
the major sources of smog, acid rain and toxic air pollution in order to force 
the nation's 100 most polluted areas into compliance with federal air quality 
standards over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The one exception would be Los Angeles, the nation's smoggiest city, which 
would be given 20 years, until 2010, to achieve attainment. 
</P>
<P>
Rivaling the tax code in its complexity and scope, the bill takes a two-track 
approach to lowering levels of ozone, a major component of urban smog, by 
controlling emissions from both stationary and mobile sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
It mandates use of reformulated and cleaner-burning gasoline mixtures for cars 
in Los Angeles and eight other urban areas with the nation's worst smog levels, 
and it expands the regulation of toxic chemicals, many of them carcinogenic, 
from the seven covered under current law to more than 190. 
</P>
<P>
To curb acid rain, the focus of the bill's strongest provisions, giant 
utilities in the Midwest would be required to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 
10 million tons, with a cap at 1980 levels, after the year 2000. The production 
and use of chlorofluorocarbons, the main class of chemicals responsible for the 
erosion of Earth's protective ozone layer, would also be phased out by the 
Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve these reductions, the bill imposes restrictions that would affect 
virtually every major industry and touch the lives -- and the pocketbooks -- of 
American consumers in myriad ways, from raising the price of the cars they 
drive to determining what ingredients go into the hair sprays and deodorants 
they buy. 
</P>
<P>
It will also cost a lot -- anywhere from $21.5 billion per year by the Bush 
Administration's estimate to more than twice that amount if the industry 
lobby's figures are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
But cost is only one aspect of a controversy that, trapped by competing 
political, regional and economic interests, has stalled passage of clean air 
legislation in Congress at the committee level for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The gridlock was finally broken at the end of 1988, when Mitchell, an ardent 
environmentalist, became majority leader and George Bush, newly elected as 
President, radically departed from Ronald Reagan Administration policies by 
calling for passage of tougher clean air laws. 
</P>
<P>
A much stronger version of the bill drafted by the Senate Environment and 
Public Works Committee subsequently won the endorsement of environmentalists 
and public health groups but was strongly opposed by the White House as too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Calculating that he did not have enough votes to defeat a filibuster or 
override a threatened White House veto, Mitchell agreed to closed-door 
negotiations with the Administration that finally produced the clean air 
compromise last month. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SENATE VERSION OF CLEAN AIR BILL 
</P>
<P>
 The clean air bill passed by the Senate is substantially tougher than current 
law, but still weaker in many respects than regulations already in effect, or 
proposed for, California. Here is a comparison: 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS -- Current law: Restricts tailpipe emissions of 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx), major components of smog, to .41 grams 
per mile (gpm) for hydrocarbons, 1.0 gpm for NOx, and carbon monoxide to 3.4 
gpm. 
</P>
<P>
California law: Restricts hydrocarbon emissions to .25 grams per mile, carbon 
monoxide to 3.4 grams per mile for the first 50,000 miles, phased in over a 
three-year period. Currently limits NOx emissions to 0.4 grams per mile. 
Another proposal not yet law but expected to be adopted would cut hydrocarbon 
emissions by an additional 50% beginning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Senate bill: Same emission reductions as California mandates for 1993, but 
another round of 50% emission cuts would go into effect in 2004 if 12 or more 
"seriously" polluted cities outside California remain above federally mandated 
ozone limits in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
ALTERNATIVE FUELS -- Current law: No provision for alternative fuels in current 
law. 
</P>
<P>
California law: No current provisions. Regulations being developed would 
require cleaner gasoline for all cars by 1993 and the phase in of even cleaner 
alternative fuels beginning in 1994. Alternative fuels would be twice as clean 
as the cleanest gasoline then in use. 
</P>
<P>
Senate bill: Requires that new cars in the nation's nine smoggiest cities run 
on a cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline mixture by 1994. Even cleaner fuel 
standards would be phased in for fleet vechicles in serious smog areas starting 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
ACID RAIN -- Current law: No provisions for acid rain control currently in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
California law: No provisions related specifically to acid rain, but state 
places limits on both NOx and sulfur dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Senate bill: Requires 107 polluting utilities in the Midwest and Southeast to 
cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons in the year 2000, when emission 
levels would be capped at 1980 levels. Utilities also would cut NOx emissions 
by 4 million tons by 2005. Allowance system would let utilities reducing 
emissions below the required levels sell "pollution credits" to others. 
</P>
<P>
AIR TOXICS -- Current law: Imposes controls on the emissions of seven chemicals 
classified as toxic. Enforcement has been lax. 
</P>
<P>
California law: State regulates same seven chemicals classified as toxic by 
federal law. The state also regulates two additional toxics not regulated by 
the federal government -- benzene and chromium. State developing regulations 
for another seven, and studying 10 others for possible regulation.

CONFERENCE CHAIR DESERVES CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your coverage of the Pasadena Women's Conference, sponsored by 
the Commission on the Status of Women, in the San Gabriel Valley View section 
of the L.A. Times on Wednesday, March 21. This year's conference was attended 
by over 350 women, more than in any past year. 
</P>
<P>
While your article was excellent, I feel compelled to point out one major 
omission: the name of the Chair of the 1990 Pasadena Women's Conference, Emily 
Ballance, was not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
A conference of this size required a tremendous amount of work and Ms. Ballance 
put in hundreds of hours of volunteer time to make the event a real success. 
</P>
<P>
A newcomer to the Commission on the Status of Women, she worked with a Planning 
Committee of 18 members, beginning in October, 1989. She led this group in 
obtaining financial support from co-sponsoring organizations, deciding what 
issues to address in the 21 workshops, contacting and confirming 43 workshop 
leaders and panelists, coordinating arrangements for 32 display tables for 
community groups, writing the brochure, securing keynote speaker (state) 
Senator Diane Watson (who was excellent!) and many more tasks demanding time 
and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
When anyone works this hard on a volunteer basis -- and has such success -- she 
(or he) should be recognized! I saw first-hand the contributions Ms. Ballance 
made to this year's conference. 
</P>
<P>
Again, we appreciate the excellent coverage, but I hope The Times will join us 
in giving credit where credit is due. Thank you.

MUSEUM DOESN'T FORGET THAT DOLLS ARE TOYS AFTER ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Mary Shaw Doll and Toy Museum is not a roped-off "don't touch" kind of 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Pee Wee Herman rubs shoulders with antique porcelain figurines. Raggedy Ann 
shares shelf space with a hand-carved wooden soldier. And, within limits, 
visitors are free to handle items on display at the museum, on a downtown La 
Puente street that is lined with auto repair shops, check-cashing 
establishments and billiard halls. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a place where people can come and enjoy dolls," said Wyatt Seal, 
the soft-spoken museum director. 
</P>
<P>
He makes no attempt to explain the dolls' cultural relevance or artistic style. 
His emphasis is not on amassing a priceless or historically significant 
collection. But the museum's panorama of playthings suffices to bring smiles to 
the scores of people who have visited and taken the tour. 
</P>
<P>
They crowd around the themed doll displays, laughing at Seal's corny jokes and 
marveling at the toys and gadgets pointed out by tour director Susana Lozano. 
</P>
<P>
Their eyes glow at the sight of the museum's shelves, bursting with dolls, toy 
trucks, games and stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have Gidget?" one young guest asked recently, as she stared at a 
display case full of Barbie dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are encouraged to "interact" with the collection, which includes 
Cabbage Patch Kids and dolls from Poland, Holland, the Dominican Republic and 
Mexico. It has new dolls, such as Masters of the Universe figures, and old 
ones, including the hand-carved wooden soldier from Bulgaria, which was made in 
1899. 
</P>
<P>
Although unsupervised play is not permitted, Lozano hands around selected items 
and demonstrates others, such as a toy train or a mechanical barking puppy. 
</P>
<P>
Seal's policy is to accept any doll or toy that is donated or loaned. In the 15 
months since the museum opened, 47 children and adults have found a good home 
for their dolls and toys at the Mary Shaw museum. 
</P>
<P>
"One little boy donated a Batman figure. Another time a young man came in just 
to kill time, and a few days later he came back and brought some 
black-and-white clown dolls for us," said Lozano. "It just happens that way." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times the kids' mothers are bugging them to get rid of some of their 
old dolls and toys. Here, they know they can always come and look at them, and 
they'll never be thrown away," Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what prompted Mary Shaw, 74, a volunteer at La Puente's nonprofit 
Delhaven Community Center, to donate her doll collection to the center in May, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't bear to just sell them off," said Shaw, who had gathered the 
collection over the course of 30 years. "I wanted somebody else to enjoy them 
like I did. When girls, even grown-up girls, saw my collection, they would say, 
'I used to have one like this but my mother gave it away,' or 'I don't know 
whatever happened to my dolls. I wish I had them back.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Shaw offered her dolls to the center. The Delhaven staff thought she was 
talking about three or four dolls, a dozen at the most. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a fellow out to pick them up with a little truck, and she had 800 
dolls she wanted to give away," Seal recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Not knowing what to do with all the dolls, the Delhaven staff held a meeting 
and came up with the museum idea. 
</P>
<P>
The community quickly took the idea to heart. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ferranti, a local magician, volunteered to give free magic shows for groups 
touring the museum. A local doll collector brought over her framed jigsaw 
puzzles to decorate the museum's walls. Volunteers built the display cases with 
donated materials. Start-up costs amounted to $120. 
</P>
<P>
Since Dec. 14, 1988, the little museum has hosted about 50 tour groups, 
including visitors from day-care centers, service clubs and retirement homes. 
"Lots of times, people just happen by and come in to look around," said Seal, 
who also is program director of the community center. 
</P>
<P>
There is no admission fee. "The community we're in isn't that well-to-do, and 
we didn't feel it was right to charge anything," Seal said. "Most people make 
donations, whether it's three or four cents or a few dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Day-old baked goods are offered for sale, with the proceeds used to help 
operate the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The collection has grown rapidly to more than 1,700 dolls and toys, and now it 
needs more space. Seal said he hopes to move it into larger quarters near the 
Delhaven Thrift Shop this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But spacious surroundings aren't very likely to change the museum's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Seal pointed to a huge, stuffed dinosaur perched on a ledge over the doorway. 
"A group of kids from a treatment center for the emotionally disturbed toured 
the museum and one boy told us he wanted to bring us a gift. He came back with 
that dinosaur. I think it gave him some self-esteem, to know that his toy would 
be on display here."

SCIENCE AND MUSIC ARE IN HARMONY AT CALTECH 
</P>

Flushed and nervous, Robert Navin stepped onto a low podium, perched his guitar 
on his knee and began to pluck out the notes of Gaspar Sanz's "Pavanas and 
Canarios." 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively at first, then with increasing confidence, Navin's fingers danced 
over the frets of the instrument, bringing the difficult piece to life. 
</P>
<P>
The recent afternoon recital was a dry run for Navin's performance exams at the 
Royal Academy of Music in London. It was one of several informal classical 
music recitals played on the campus of this well-known institution every 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
The Juilliard School? USC? Guess again. 
</P>
<P>
How about the California Institute of Technology? 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena school, known for its brainy science students who do more fiddling 
with computers than, say, violins, actually has a thriving music program. 
</P>
<P>
It just may be the best-kept secret on campus -- more so, perhaps, than even 
the undercover planning sessions for the notorious senior pranks. 
</P>
<P>
"When we tell people that I conduct Caltech's wind ensemble and two jazz bands, 
and that (wife) Delores oversees the chamber music program's 20 ensembles, the 
response is frequently: 'I didn't know Caltech had a music program!' " said 
Bill Bing, one of Caltech's five music instructors, whose wife also works at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
There is no music department or music major offered at the preeminent science 
and engineering institute. In fact, the music rooms are literally underground, 
in the windowless basement of the student activities center. 
</P>
<P>
But in a typical year, Bing said, 90 of the school's 1,600 undergraduate and 
graduate students, along with 30 staff members, faculty, alumni and employees 
at the Caltech-affiliated Jet Propulsion Laboratory, participate in one of the 
Caltech-sponsored ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a devoted following. "We have a loyal community that comes 
to all our concerts," said Allen Gross, director of the Caltech symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Navin, who at 25 is working on his doctorate in particle physics at Caltech, 
believes that science and music are not incompatible. He has played the guitar 
since he was 13 and has been a physics devotee nearly as long. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde," Navin said after his recital. "Science is a 
very human endeavor. You operate on hunches. With music your approach has to be 
very precise, and you try to be expressive without being numerical." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Santoso, a 22-year-old clarinetist and mechanical engineering major, takes 
the comparison between music and science one step further. When he gets stuck 
on a particularly difficult engineering problem, he sometimes puts down his 
work and picks up his clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
"This music thing kind of hones my skills in approaching a problem on an 
intuitive level," Santoso said. "Sometimes in engineering there just isn't a 
logical solution. That's where music comes in because you can find new ways of 
solving problems." 
</P>
<P>
Arts teachers who find themselves in a science world sometimes solve their 
problems with a duet of logic and machinery. 
</P>
<P>
Delores Bing said she uses electronic gadgets, such as tuning machines and 
metronomes, that employ the quantified measures scientists are most comfortable 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"It can also be difficult to teach highly cerebral people to become physically 
involved with music," she said. "We find that using a video camera enables 
students to see that a lack of physical movement can, in fact, be as 
distracting to the audience as excessive gyrations." 
</P>
<P>
The rewards of working with Caltech students are great, the music instructors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are disciplined, they know how to apply themselves, they're highly 
motivated. What they can produce in a short time is extraordinary," said guitar 
teacher Darryl Denning. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, it is the students who teach the instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bing said he never knew before coming to Caltech that a "phase shift" 
might occur when one musician in a quartet gets a beat ahead of others. Nor was 
he aware, until a student pointed it out one day, that because of its small 
bell the piccolo trumpet is an inefficient transmitter of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its appeal to scientists, music is an important form of expression 
for Caltech students, Gross said. "It gives the students a way they can express 
a part of themselves that they don't get a chance to do otherwise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is also an important way to escape the incredible pressure that all Caltech 
students -- who are in the top 1% academically nationwide, according to school 
officials -- face in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
One Ph.D. candidate dedicated his dissertation to Denning. "He said that 
without guitar class, he would have gone mad," Denning recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Socially, music is especially important for Caltech students. 
</P>
<P>
While their studies are highly specialized and often isolating, students can 
make music together in a non-competitive situation that often puts a freshman, 
graduate student and a professor in the same ensemble, even though they would 
never collaborate as equals in the laboratory, Delores Bing said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these kids were freaks in their home schools because of their 
intelligence," Gross said. "Here, they may relate best to other people within a 
musical situation."

EXPANDED FISHING ZONE CREATES BOOM FOR U.S. TRAWLER FLEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERENCE FINAN, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, the United States had virtually no factory trawler fleet that 
could harvest and process the riches of the open seas. The seas were dominated 
by foreign fishing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of federal legislation and a lot of capital investment, that 
situation has reversed. 
</P>
<P>
A new report released by the Alaska Factory Trawler Assn. shows that the fleet 
that sails the North Pacific Ocean has become the largest in the nation and one 
of the largest in the world, making a significant contribution to the states of 
Washington and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from trumpeting its achievements, however, officials representing the 
fleet hope the numbers compiled by the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand 
will throw some water on a political fire raging over the issue of who owns the 
fish in the waters off Alaska -- Alaskans or those from the "Lower 49." 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the fleet has experienced rapid growth since 1986, when 
there were 12 trawlers ranging in size from 130 feet to 340 feet worth an 
estimated $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, those numbers had grown to 43 vessels worth $520 million. This year 
the fleet consists of 57 ships worth $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become the biggest fleet in the nation," said Bruce Buls, a spokesman 
for the Seattle-based Alaska Factory Trawler Assn. "The North Pacific is the 
bread basket of U.S. fisheries. There are other areas that are working, but 
many are on hard times. Nothing compares with the North Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The fleet has accomplished its impressive growth with the help of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. The act extended U.S. 
fisheries jurisdiction to 200 miles off the coast of the United States, 
including Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, foreign vessels were gradually excluded from the 200-mile 
Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. Today, the only foreigners allowed into the 
EEZ are those working in joint ventures with Americans. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. commercial fishermen were slow at first to take full advantage of the 
opportunities presented by the Magnuson act, partly because Americans 
traditionally operated as independent fishermen in small boats pursuing 
high-value seafood such as salmon and crab. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pacific salmon and crab industry had some hard years in the early 
1980s, leading many fisherman to convert their vessels into trawlers for 
year-round work in the rich grounds of the Bering Sea and North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
It took investments of millions of dollars in new ships, conversions of 
existing vessels, and new processing plants, but the fleet was profitable by 
the late 1980s. The fish caught in the North Pacific, while relatively low in 
value, are in high demand around the world, particularly Asia. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska, the trawler fleet now accounts for about 9,700 direct and indirect 
jobs. In Washington, the fleet is responsible for 8,900 direct and indirect 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the factory trawler fleet contributes about $500 
million annually to the Washington economy, or 56% of the $887 million total 
contribution to the state brought in by all commercial fishing. In King County, 
where much of the fleet is based, the factory trawlers will contribute an 
estimated $301 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not have numbers for the fleet's total economic contribution to 
Alaska's economy, but said non-payroll expenditures this year are expected to 
be about $71 million.

BOATS: Landlocked Costa Mesa was a major California center for boat building 
until soaring property values and environmental regulations pushed the industry 
out. . . . But many boats still are made in the county (D5). On display when 
the Anaheim Boat Show opens today: "Boat in a Bag," an inflatable contained in 
a sack. Its manufacturer, Elco Marine of Santa Ana, says it's used mostly for 
pulling water skiers. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

HOT PROPERTY: The infamous Tara Ranch in Carbon Canyon, site of a mob-style 
ambush a year ago, is up for sale. . . . The 35 1/2-acre spread was owned by 
flamboyant former Highway Patrol officer Horace (Big Mac) McKenna, who tried to 
buy the Mustang Club topless bar in Santa Ana before he was murdered at the 
ranch's entrance. Asking price: $2.5 million. . . . Real estate agent Fred 
Davis says most prospective buyers have been aware of the ranch's history but 
were not mere curiosity-seekers. . . . Brea police say the case remains under 
investigation. "We're plugging away at it," Detective Grant Gulickson said.

Melissa Fontes, a 16-year-old cheerleader at Woodbridge High School, has been 
told she can't audition for next year's squad because she failed a chemistry 
class. 
</P>
<P>
But if the same thing had happened to a student involved in any other 
extracurricular activity, different rules would apply. For at Woodbridge and 
the other two high schools in the Irvine Unified School District, pep squad 
members are held to a higher academic standard. 
</P>
<P>
With next year's cheerleader tryouts scheduled for today, Melissa planned to 
challenge this rule at Tuesday night's school board meeting. But at the last 
minute, district officials offered to postpone the tryouts until Melissa and 
her mother could discuss the complaint privately with school board members. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this concession, Melissa is far from happy about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't understand how they can figure it's a fair rule," said Melissa, 
who has been a cheerleader for two years. 
</P>
<P>
School Principal Greg Cops says the stricter rules are justified for pep squad 
members because "they're out in front of 3,000 people at a football game with a 
microphone in their hand. They command respect." 
</P>
<P>
The district's policy states that all athletes must maintain at least a 2.0, or 
C, grade-point average each semester, district Supt. David Brown said. An F 
will not disqualify an athlete as long as his or her overall average is at 
least 2.0, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But at University and Woodridge high schools, pepsters, as members of the pep 
squad are commonly known, must maintain a grade-point average of at least 2.5, 
while the standard is 2.0 at Irvine High School. And pepsters at Woodridge must 
also provide five letters of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, each high school is free to adopt a "no Fs" rule, as Woodbridge 
has for the school's pepsters, including cheerleaders, school mascots and the 
drill team, Cops said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been our policy for 10 years here, and we've reviewed it several times," 
Cops said. "But we believe the F grade is a responsibility indicator. Normally, 
for students at the high school level who seek extra help and go the extra 
mile, Fs are not awarded. F represents an issue of not following through." 
</P>
<P>
According to Melissa's mother, Patricia Passy, Melissa has a 2.9 grade-point 
average -- almost a B average -- with the F in chemistry factored in.

SUPERVISORS SUGGEST REVIVING VOLUNTARY WATER RESTRICTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: COUNTY OFFICIALS CONSIDER CONSERVATION MEASURES AFTER THE STATE 
GOVERNMENT WARNS THAT CALIFORNIA'S RESERVE IS REACHING PERILOUSLY LOW LEVELS.

<P>
With California in the grip of a dire and possibly unending water shortage, 
some Orange County Supervisors said Tuesday that they favor legislation calling 
for 10% voluntary reductions in water use by county residents. 
</P>
<P>
The county, which has few ways of directly influencing water consumption, 
enacted voluntary restrictions in August, 1988, and Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder said she believed the time was right to resurrect the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to take it off the shelf and dust it off," the supervisor 
said, adding that she has instructed the county's Environmental Management 
Agency to prepare a resolution to implement the cutbacks. "We are approaching a 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has underground water reserves that help protect it against the 
immediate effects of California's drought, but state and local officials said 
they are worried about long-term consequences if the rainfall deficit 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors eagerly backed the voluntary conservation measure Tuesday, and also 
expressed support for a proposal by Supervisor Don R. Roth to ask restaurants 
to post notices informing patrons that water will only be given to those who 
ask for it. Not serving water to every restaurant customer saves both the 
drinking water and the water needed to wash glasses, the supervisor noted. 
</P>
<P>
The rush Tuesday to consider water conservation measures came in response to 
warnings by state officials that California water supplies are reaching 
perilously low levels after four years of sustained drought. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here today to encourage the Board of Supervisors with all due haste to 
take whatever measures are necessary to mitigate the water shortage," Ed 
Thornhill, water conservation manager for the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California, told the supervisors. "Should this drought continue, we 
anticipate severe urban shortages next year." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, which sits atop a large underground lake, has fared better than 
most areas of the state, but supervisors said the county needs to play its part 
in helping reduce the demand for water. 
</P>
<P>
"That lake gives us some comfort, but you have to worry about the long term," 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if formally adopted by the board, Tuesday's proposals probably would not 
dramatically reduce the county's overall demand, officials conceded. And 
although Thornhill applauded the proposed actions, they also illustrate the 
limits of the county's power when it comes to controlling consumption. 
</P>
<P>
All water in Orange County is under the control of municipal and regional 
authorities that stand apart from county government. 
</P>
<P>
"We can suggest things. We can recommend, but we can't order," County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said after the meeting. "There's just so 
much we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Thornhill called the proposed voluntary actions "an important step to getting 
the message out." More drastic water controls, if they are needed, will have to 
come from cities and local water districts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
George Britton, the county environmental agency's acting manager of advanced 
planning, said members of the intergovernmental Water Conservation Task Force 
are meeting to sketch out water conservation proposals, which will include the 
suggestion for a 10% voluntary reduction. The task force intends to report back 
to the board with its recommendations sometime in May, he added, but the 
supervisors will proceed with a vote on the restrictions next week.

AN AMNESTY CUTBACK; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: THE INS WILL CLOSE ITS GARDEN GROVE OFFICE AND MOVE ITS CASELOAD 
TO LOCATIONS IN SANTA ANA AND BUENA PARK.

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his attempt to file for permanent U.S. residency under an amnesty law, 
Jordanian national Nedal Hamad said he had to wait all day to ask a question at 
one immigration office and stood in line for three hours to obtain a form at 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Hamad, 22, then discovered the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
office on Brookhurst Avenue near his home in Garden Grove. There was no line. 
Amnesty applicants sat in comfortable seats watching television as they waited 
for their names to be called. And most surprising of all, Hamad said, a clerk 
addressed him politely in his native Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very easy," Hamad said with a smile Tuesday after spending half an hour 
at the Garden Grove office obtaining his permanent residency card. 
</P>
<P>
But effective May 1, immigrants such as Hamad will have to go elsewhere for 
assistance. In a budget-cutting move, the INS is closing its popular Brookhurst 
office, forcing thousands of immigrants to go to two remaining INS legalization 
offices in Santa Ana and Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration consultants and immigrant rights advocates say immigrants have to 
wait at the other offices for days or weeks to obtain permits to work so they 
can gain legal residency status. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really totally unfair," said Teresa Rios, an Orange County representative 
of Hispanic Advocacy, a nonprofit Riverside group that provides free legal 
advice to immigrants. "The whole intent of the immigration reform law was to 
make things easier for the immigrants. But now the government is making things 
more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
But immigration officials said they do not believe the closure will be 
disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure those who have a problem with this (closure) that services will 
continue," said Bill King, INS' regional director of immigration reform. "No 
one is going to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove closure is one of four planned by the INS within the next few 
weeks in the Los Angeles-Orange County area. The others are in Pomona, Van Nuys 
and Torrance. The offices were among 14 temporary facilities originally set up 
in the region to process applications under amnesty provisions set forth by 
Congress in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. The offices all opened 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants having five years of continuous residence in the United States since 
1982 were declared eligible for U.S. residency. Although the INS' original 
application deadline was between May, 1987, and May, 1988, the deadline has 
been extended indefinitely pending resolution of two lawsuits challenging INS' 
rejection of some applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Now that three-quarters of those eligible for amnesty have been processed, King 
said, the federal agency is beginning a phase-out of the legalization offices. 
All of the offices nationally are to be closed by the end of September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's got to realize this is a temporary program and that our resources 
are not unlimited," said King, who is based in Mission Viejo. "We never 
intended for them to stay open beyond their need." 
</P>
<P>
The Southland closures will save the INS about $1 million a year, King said. 
</P>
<P>
All of Garden Grove's cases are being sent to the Santa Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it will cause any inconvenience at all," George Newland, chief 
legalization officer in Santa Ana, said of his office's increased caseload. 
"Really, we're just going to incorporate their cards and files with ours and we 
will hold all of our interviews here." 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove office has processed 43,000 immigrants and continues to review 
them at the rate of 3,000 a month, INS officials said. On a typical morning, as 
many as 300 immigrants show up for appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases involve the second phase of the amnesty program, which 
provides immigrants with permanent residency status. The immigrants received 
temporary residency cards under the first phase of the program, enabling them 
to live and work legally pending further processing. Immigrants with temporary 
cards have had 30 months in which to apply for permanent residency. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration rights advocates fear that Garden Grove and the other offices are 
closing too quickly to meet the needs of all immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our clients have come to us because they have lost a job because they 
did not have work authorization," Rios said. "If we cannot get a permit for 
them in three months, they cannot work during that time." 
</P>
<P>
Closure of the offices also comes at an inopportune time for immigrants still 
filing for residency under the amnesty extension, said Peter Schey, executive 
director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los Angeles. 
Those immigrants, Schey said, are still in the early stages of the program, 
filing for temporary residency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a final group of people being squeezed out of the legalization doors," 
Schey said. "These people are either going to get pushed in the door or they 
are going to be pushed out." 
</P>
<P>
This group of applicants began filing for amnesty after the application 
deadline was delayed pending a ruling by a federal appeals court on two 
lawsuits against the INS, Schey said. The suits, filed by Schey's group, 
challenge INS' rejection of amnesty applicants because they had either traveled 
outside the country during the residency period or traveled without INS 
permission while their applications were processed. 
</P>
<P>
Although immigrants may continue going to other offices, some of those who 
visit Garden Grove said they are reluctant to travel elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clean, big office and the people are very nice with the clients," 
said Norma Egbert, a notary public and immigration consultant from Alta Loma in 
San Bernardino County. "At other offices, the clerks say, 'I don't speak your 
language.' " 
</P>
<P>
Newland described his clerks in Santa Ana as courteous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happens is if you don't give the person the answer he wants he 
thinks you're being rude to him," Newland said. 
</P>
<P>
King said the decision was made to close Garden Grove and not Santa Ana because 
a regional telephone bank to answer amnesty questions is in the Santa Ana 
office, and would be too costly to move. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Gonzalez, an immigration counselor at the office who reviews claims for 
amnesty, said he will miss the camaraderie he and other office workers have 
enjoyed with the attorneys, consultants and immigrants with whom they have 
dealt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to go to another office," Gonzalez said. "A lot of people are 
coming here from L.A., Hollywood and Pomona because the treatment is good." 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Lujan, 38, of Downey was among about 150 immigrants at the Garden 
Grove office Tuesday. He had spent the past six months getting ready for 
permanent residency, only to learn Tuesday his case was being transferred to 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I will have to wait," Lujan said dejectedly. "Hopefully, it will not 
be for too long."

CRISTIANITOS AIRPORT SITE FAVORED BY PANEL 
</P>

Warning that Orange County residents face a crippling air-transportation 
crisis, the Airport Site Coalition urged the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to 
create a public-private joint venture to pursue construction of a new regional 
airport in Cristianitos Canyon near San Clemente or at South Camp Pendleton in 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The group also named Potrero los Pinos plateau in Cleveland National Forest and 
March Air Force Base in Riverside County as less feasible but still worthwhile 
locations for a new airport. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's report, however, received a cool reception from the Board of 
Supervisors, which charged the coalition three years ago with picking a 
suitable airport location as part of a court settlement that limits expansion 
of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors still have no timetable for resolving the airport-construction 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to the coalition's report, the following is what it would cost to 
build an airport at each of the four sites and how many passengers each would 
be able to handle a year: 
</P>
<P>
* Cristianitos Canyon -- $1.8 billion and 15.1 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
* South Camp Pendleton -- $6.5 billion and 33.8 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
* Potrero los Pinos -- $6.3 billion and 15.4 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
* March Air Force Base -- $3.3 billion and 15.4 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
After Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder scolded the coalition for not involving 
adjacent counties in its deliberations, the board voted 4 to 0, with Supervisor 
Gaddi H. Vasquez absent, to refer the coalition's findings to the county staff 
for a 60-day review. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, a key county official said the coalition's report was "dead on 
arrival" because each of the recommended sites has significant environmental 
and political obstacles, including strong opposition from elected officials and 
other government agencies ranging from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the 
U.S. Forest Service and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give it much hope," Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth said 
after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition used the meeting to showcase its findings and urge officials not 
to shelve them. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, Coalition president Leland Oliver told the supervisors, the 
county will need to serve 22.2 million passengers annually -- 14.8 million more 
than the maximum volume permitted at John Wayne Airport under a 1985 court 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Public pressure created by lack of airline seats will push the supervisors to 
act, coalition officials said after the board meeting. In addition, they said, 
state legislation may force restricted airports, such as John Wayne, to allow 
more flights and may create regional joint-powers authorities to find and 
develop airport sites. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Orange County Cities Airport Authority, composed of Anaheim, Garden 
Grove, Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Stanton, voted last week to pursue George 
Air Force Base in San Bernardino County as a regional airport site and invited 
the Airport Site Coalition to join forces in that effort. The base is scheduled 
to be closed by the Pentagon in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he will continue to propose that Air Force base as Orange County's 
most logical airport location -- a site that some coalition members believe is 
far too remote to serve the county's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he recognizes that there will need to be monorail or high-speed train 
service between the Air Force base and Orange County, and not the Las 
Vegas-Anaheim link under consideration by the California-Nevada Super Speed 
Train Commission. Roth is the commission's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente officials, meanwhile, said they will continue to resist any 
attempt to pursue Cristianitos Canyon as an airport site. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry," said San Clemente Councilman Thomas Lorch, who was the city's 
representative at site-selection meetings. "I think Cristianitos Canyon was 
somebody's choice all along, before any studies were done," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) and other elected officials have vowed to prevent 
construction of a Cristianitos airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Packard said, "this report will not take us anywhere. I think 
the process of site selection in Orange County was flawed from the start. None 
of these sites is acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition board members recommended Cristianitos, Oliver said, because it is 
located on privately owned land in the county's unincorporated area, would 
serve a higher percentage of the county's air-traffic needs and would be 
cheaper to build than the other sites. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference later, Oliver acknowledged that the coalition had 
resurrected the Cristianitos Canyon proposal from a list of mid-ranked sites 
last July, despite objections from public participants. 
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion," he said, "the final decision had to be made by the board of 
the Airport Site Coalition."

MAN'S BODY IS FOUND AFTER HOUSE FIRE

A Garden Grove man died early Tuesday in a blaze that engulfed a single-family 
home before firefighters could get to the scene, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the home, at 12552 Ocean Breeze Drive, collapsed shortly after 
firefighters arrived around 12:30 a.m., said Ellen Covey, spokeswoman for the 
Garden Grove Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Seven fire trucks and 35 firefighters battled the blaze, which was contained in 
about 45 minutes. Damage is estimated at $480,000, Covey said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedic Mark Munley was injured in the blaze and was sent to AMI Medical 
Center of Garden Grove, where he was treated for second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Roy Lee Kelley, 58. He was discovered in a 
bedroom of the house. The cause of the fire is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials have determined that arson caused an unrelated fire Monday 
night in a vacant building formerly owned by Kaiser Permanente, a hospital and 
medical services company. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time medical building at 11900 Gilbert St., now owned by the Garden 
Grove Redevelopment Agency, sustained $400,000 in damage, Covey said. There 
were no injuries in that fire, which spread to about one-third of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The building was vacant for about three years, said Armando Morales, 
real-property agent for the city of Garden Grove. The city purchased the 
building and land from Kaiser Permanente in 1988 and had planned to lease the 
facility, he said. MARY HELEN BERG

DISTRAUGHT GUNMAN HOLDS OUT 17 HOURS

<P>
Apparently distraught over a fight with his girlfriend, a 42-year-old man armed 
with a handgun kept a sheriff's SWAT team at bay outside his apartment for 17 
hours before surrendering peacefully, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the standoff, about a dozen residents were evacuated from neighboring 
units in the two-story Pinebrook Apartments at the corner of Avenida de la 
Carlota and Los Alisos Boulevard. The nearby Oakbrook Village shopping center 
was also closed. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff lasted from 7 p.m. Monday until noon Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert James Anderson surrendered to deputies from his ground-floor unit when 
he heard a tape-recorded message from his girlfriend saying that she loved him 
and wouldn't leave him, said Sgt. Larry Jones, of the sheriff's hostage 
negotiations team. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very much in love with her," Jones said. "We knew she was the key." 
</P>
<P>
Before his surrender, Anderson repeatedly asked the deputies to shoot and kill 
him. He also was extremely intoxicated from alcohol and hadn't slept for 
several days, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept asking, 'What do I have to do to get the deputies to shoot me?' " said 
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson, one of about 50 officers 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, Anderson fired about 15 shots from the patio of his 
apartment, witnesses said. Olson said Anderson told deputies he had 200 rounds 
of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
One of the shots broke a window at the Oakbrook Plaza office building on the 
24000 block of Avenida de la Carlota, which was also closed Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"A few people won't get their loans approved today," said Nancy Beetem, an 
employee of a mortgage banker in the office building and a resident of the 
Pinebrook Apartments. "What a way to get the day off." 
</P>
<P>
Olson said that Anderson was taken into custody solely for a psychological 
screening but added that he could face charges of negligent discharge of a 
firearm and for property damage to the office building's window. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said Anderson had been divorced about five years ago and was employed by 
his brother, a painting contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem was getting him to come out without his gun. He didn't 
want to give it up. We told him we wouldn't let him see his girlfriend until he 
put it down because we were concerned for her safety, and that worked," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents who were not evacuated were forced to stay home from work 
because police lines prevented them from reaching their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Luke Teves, who lives above Anderson, said he slept in his car when he returned 
home to find his doorway blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"But my poor aunt spent the night in the closet," Teves said. "They couldn't 
get her out because she would have to pass right by his (Anderson's) door, and 
it might have set him off. She didn't sleep at all." 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m. Tuesday, the shopping center had reopened and patrons were lining up 
outside a restaurant preparing to serve a late lunch. Other restaurants delayed 
their reopenings until the dinner hour. 
</P>
<P>
As the morning wore on, several dozen shopping center employees waited in a 
nearby parking lot at Laguna Hills Mall for further notice on their work 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Look how much chaos he (Anderson) has caused," said Ronald Hicks, district 
manager for the Monterey Bay Canners restaurant chain. "We lost a lunch shift 
today and part of last night's dinner shift, and I have to pay salaries of 
people who aren't here. I've probably lost $5,000." WENDY PAULSON

CENSUS OFFICES GET REQUESTS FOR FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
U.S. Census offices in Orange County have been flooded with telephone calls in 
recent days from residents who have not received questionnaires, even though 
the official deadline for completing and returning the once-a-decade national 
survey was Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the queries came from South County residents, most of them 
newcomers whose homes were built during the past year, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bellamy, census director in the Irvine office that serves South County, 
said his office has received 200 to 300 calls from residents requesting 
questionnaires. The Buena Park office reported about 75 calls, while the 
Fullerton and Santa Ana offices have also received numerous requests. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Census Bureau first began surveying the county in mid-1989 to put 
together a mailing list, thousands of houses have been built since then, 
Bellamy said. The census has done occasional updates, but the last of those is 
only now being completed. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been particularly acute in South County, where the bulk of the 
growth has occurred. Upward of 10,000 questionnaires for South County residents 
on the updated list are expected to be mailed out by the middle of next week, 
Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
While the official deadline was Sunday, residents have until mid-April to 
return the forms without expecting a call or visit from a census enumerator, 
bureau officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, residents who haven't heard from the census should call their closest 
district office to ask that a new form be sent, Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
The bureaus can be reached by calling these phone numbers: Irvine, (714) 
476-6500; Santa Ana, (714) 668-1000; Buena Park, (714) 994-8000, and Fullerton, 
(714) 449-8800. ERIC BAILEY

TENTATIVE PACT MAY END TEACHER PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently ending a contract dispute that has lasted nearly a year, officials 
from the Huntington Beach City School District and its teachers union announced 
Tuesday that they have reached a tentative agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed a protest campaign by teachers that included picketing, 
letter writing and a boycott of extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, the district's 220 teachers will receive a 7% 
pay raise retroactive to July 1, larger steps in the salary schedule and full 
health coverage, all staples of their contract request. 
</P>
<P>
"We're screaming around here, we're so excited," union President Sharon 
Boudreau said. "We're very satisfied with the contract . . . and we're glad 
it's finally over." 
</P>
<P>
The district's lead negotiator, Assistant Supt. Ronald Brown, acknowledged that 
board members decided late last week to meet many of the teachers' requests to 
quickly resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"In looking at the needs of the association and the district, and the board's 
efforts to meet those needs, the board felt that the terms of this tentative 
contract were within their parameters, and that by doing so, they could bring 
this to closure," Brown said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement also covers 1989-90 only, whereas the district before 
Tuesday had insisted upon a two-year pact. Teachers had argued against a 
two-year contract because they believed they would end up paying most of the 
unpredictable increases in future health-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement affects eight elementary and junior high schools with a 
total of 5,400 students. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers had demonstrated outside the district offices, packed board 
meetings, and last month halted all activities not relegated to regular class 
hours, such as grading papers at home, coordinating intramural sports programs 
and participating in educational fairs. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers also rallied many parents behind their campaign, which Boudreau 
said was the key to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the community pressure on the school board made the difference in 
getting back to the bargaining table and settling this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown declined to comment specifically on whether parents swayed board members, 
but said: "The attitude of the public is always a factor, especially in public 
sector negotiations. From the board's point of view, they decided they wanted 
to wrap it up now, and this is just the way they wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
Union members are scheduled to discuss terms of the proposed settlement on 
Thursday, and will vote April 16 and 17 on the contract. The board will 
consider finalizing the agreement at its April 17 meeting. JOHN PENNER

GUILTY VERDICT URGED IN COUPLE'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attorney prosecuting Richard L. Rodriguez, 22, who is accused of being 
hired by an Anaheim man to kill his parents, urged the jury to return guilty 
verdicts on all charges as they began their deliberations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing remarks, Assistant Dist. Atty. Ed Freeman retraced the day when 
Pauline Terry, shot four times in the upper torso, crawled past her husband, 
Owen Terry, who had been shot twice in the head, and dialed 911 for help. The 
shootings occurred Nov. 28, 1988, in their Anaheim home. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Terry, 52, was an instructional aide at Riverdale Elementary School in 
Orange and Owen Terry, 56, was an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's only son, David John Terry, 19, is also charged with murder and 
attempted murder, and his trial is expected to begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very emotional case," defense attorney Michael A. Horan told the jury 
Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court. "I told you it would be." 
</P>
<P>
But Horan argued that Rodriguez was not the killer, that he never even entered 
the Terry's home. His only role, Horan argued, was to act as a middleman to 
fence property stolen from the Terrys. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was found by police dogs, hiding in a bush at a riverbed near the 
home. Also found there were a handgun, jewelry and a pair of gloves, Freeman 
said. The gun and jewelry belonged to the Terrys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman reminded the jury of witnesses' testimony that Rodriguez had been given 
the gun by David Terry to enter the home, shoot the parents and rob them of all 
the jewelry he could get. 
</P>
<P>
If Rodriguez was fencing property for two of the key witnesses, as the defense 
claims, why didn't he say so when those witnesses testified, Freeman asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reasonable conclusion in this case is that Richard Rodriguez is the 
burglar, robber, murderer of Owen Terry and the attempted murderer of Pauline 
Terry," Freeman concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez is charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery and burglary.LUZ

AMMO PILE FOUND IN GLESS SIEGE

A Santa Ana woman who barricaded herself inside a house owned by actress Sharon 
Gless was armed with 500 rounds of ammunition, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, prosecutors said, during a burglary of the same Studio City residence a 
week before the standoff, Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Santa Ana allegedly stole an 
address book in hope of tracking down Gless at her Malibu home. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Chuck Hart said the book, which police found 
during a search of Penn's car on Friday, did not contain the address of the 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, whom police described as an obsessed fan, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 
two counts of burglary at her arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court. If 
convicted on both counts, Penn could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in 
prison, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson, saying that Penn poses a danger to the 
community, denied bail. 
</P>
<P>
Penn surrendered to police after a seven-hour standoff Friday inside the 
unoccupied house, which Gless uses as an office. Penn threatened to commit 
suicide and locked herself in a bathroom while police negotiators tried to 
persuade her to surrender, police said. 
</P>
<P>
She was armed with a loaded .22-caliber AT-22 semiautomatic rifle that she had 
bought from an Orange County sporting goods store three to four months earlier, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn had written more than 120 letters to Gless that had become increasingly 
threatening, prosecutors said. In November, 1988, a court ordered Penn not to 
harass the former star of the "Cagney and Lacey" TV series or come within 1,000 
yards of the actress and her family. 
</P>
<P>
Gless sought the order after receiving a letter from Penn's Santa Ana 
psychiatrist that said: "Although this patient has no destructive intent toward 
you, she did plan to shoot herself in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
The arrest and unfolding charges shocked Penn's classmates at Golden West 
College in Huntington Beach, where Penn studied drama and attended an acting 
class just hours before breaking into Gless' home. 
</P>
<P>
Students and instructors at Golden West's theater department said they are 
perplexed by the news, saying that everything appeared normal as Penn left a 
beginning-drama class Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was earning an A in the course and never missed a day of class, instructor 
Charles Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching the news Friday and there she was," Mitchell said. "I didn't 
believe it. I thought it had to be a mistake."

1 KILLED, 2ND SHOT IN DRIVE-BY ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old man was killed and another person wounded Tuesday during a 
drive-by shooting attack on a group of people standing in front of a house in 
El Modena, an unincorporated area within Orange, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither victim was identified by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 6:40 p.m. when a gray Honda sedan with four or five 
men inside pulled up outside the house on the 18800 block of Vine Street, 
Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the suspects leaned out the window of the car and fired several shots 
at the group," Sheriff's Department Lt. Jay Mendez said.

GRAND JURY URGES NEW PRENATAL APPROACHES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: A POLL ALSO SHOWS 81% OF OBSTETRICIANS IN SURVEY WOULD TREAT 
MEDI-CAL PATIENTS IF THEIR HOSPITALS ACCEPTED ONLY PREGNANT WOMEN ON THE 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The county is in a crisis over obstetrical care to poor pregnant women, the 
Orange County Grand Jury said Tuesday in a critical report that noted that 
2,500 women were turned away from prenatal clinics last year because of 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors recommended that the county expand its prenatal clinics and create a 
network of birthing centers to serve low-risk women. That network could be 
established as a public-private partnership similar to the arrangement under 
which Orangewood Children's Home was built with private money but is run by 
county officials, their report said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was issued the same day that doctors released a poll indicating that 
more than half of the county's obstetricians would agree to treat Medi-Cal 
patients if their hospitals could accept only pregnant women on Medi-Cal and 
not have to treat other indigent patients, often at a financial loss. Just 35% 
of the county's obstetricians now treat pregnant women on Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in perinatal care began last year, when several local hospitals 
canceled money-losing Medi-Cal contracts, causing indigent patients to flood 
UCI Medical Center in Orange. That hospital became so full that in June it 
began asking some women in labor to deliver elsewhere, because its maternity 
ward was overcrowded and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
To ease the crisis, doctors, hospitals and health care advocates have asked the 
California Medical Assistance Commission, the state commission that negotiates 
Medi-Cal contracts, to add hospitals to the network for indigent care and 
change some of their contracting procedures. The commission is scheduled 
Thursday to hold a hearing in Irvine on obstetrical care. 
</P>
<P>
The obstetrician survey was conducted jointly by the Orange County Medical 
Assn., the Orange County Obstetrics and Gynecology Society and UCI Medical 
Center to show top Medi-Cal officials that doctors would support new 
obstetrics-only contracts with hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Just one hospital in the state -- AMI Medical Center of Garden Grove -- now has 
such a contract. Medi-Cal leaders have indicated that they will not sign more 
limited-care contracts for fear that other hospitals would drop full-service 
indigent care. 
</P>
<P>
Of the county's 378 obstetricians, 190 participated in the survey. Of those, 
66, or 35%, said they are now Medi-Cal providers. 
</P>
<P>
Among other survey recommendations were: 
</P>
<P>
* The Medical Assistance Commission should permit more obstetrics-only Medi-Cal 
contracts or do away with the Medi-Cal contract ing system in Orange County 
altogether. The report did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals, obstetricians and prenatal clinics should work together for the 
planned delivery of indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors cited many factors as discouraging them from joining Medi-Cal. Chief 
among them were: inadequate reimbursement (Medi-Cal pays $1,073 for an 
uncomplicated delivery, plus prenatal care when the cost averages $2,200); 
denial or delays in payment; excessive paper work, and increased liability 
exposure when caring for indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Still, 81% of the doctors polled who are not with Medi-Cal said they might join 
the system if given protection against malpractice lawsuits. Another 72% said 
they might join if they were given a free or low-cost billing service. 
</P>
<P>
And when asked what they would do if their hospitals were to sign 
obstetrics-only Medi-Cal contracts, 54% of those responding said that move 
would lead them to accept one to three Medi-Cal maternity patients each month. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move, the report noted, could help "disperse the indigent obstetrical 
patient load throughout Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Obstetricians were not enthusiastic about one other strategy: birthing centers. 
Just 15% of those queried said they would work in one. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury's human services committee recommended that county supervisors 
meet the growing need for prenatal clinics by expanding county services to care 
for at least 4,700 women, the number of women who sought care in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also asked supervisors to establish a network of birthing centers in 
which malpractice insurance for staff would be covered by the county.

BOON OR BUST? SYSTEM CAN WREAK HAVOC; 
</P>
<P>
OPEN ENROLLMENT: SOME COACHES SAY ATHLETES ARE USING THE SANTA ANA DISTRICT 
PROGRAM TO ATTEND SCHOOLS WITH THE BEST TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana Valley High School football team nearly made the playoffs for the 
first time in 10 years last fall. But instead, Santa Ana beat Valley in the 
league final to win its fourth consecutive Century League title. 
</P>
<P>
What hurt most for Santa Ana Valley football Coach Dan Castanon is that Santa 
Ana lineman Oscar Wilson recovered a fumble and ran 35 yards for the winning 
touchdown in the 14-7 game. 
</P>
<P>
"Oscar made every big play in the game," Castanon said. "He was the difference 
between Santa Ana winning the league title and keeping us out of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a 230-pound defensive end, was The Times' lineman of the year for two 
consecutive seasons. The senior lives in Santa Ana Valley's attendance area but 
has attended Santa Ana for four years under the Santa Ana Unified School 
District's enrollment system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the system, an incoming freshman may enroll in any of the four high 
schools in the district to specialize in a field of education. For instance, 
Santa Ana High offers performing arts, Saddleback offers business, Santa Ana 
Valley has college preparatory academics and newly opened Century offers 
technical training. "A lot of good things have happened to us athletically 
because of the system," said Bill Ross, Santa Ana's athletic director and a 
teacher in the district for 31 years. "The system is a joke. I've always felt 
that if a kid lives in a certain attendance area, he should go to that school." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's system essentially is an open enrollment program that some athletes 
have used to attend the school with the best teams, according to Castanon. His 
football teams have struggled to a 10-27-3 record over the past four years 
while Santa Ana has claimed four league titles in football and four of the past 
six league titles in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, the system is great," Castanon said. "I have no qualms, as long as 
everything is equal. But it's very easy to take advantage of the system if 
things are not equal. Athletics in our district has made the (our) system an 
unjust system. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have one school winning more than others, all the athletes start 
attending one school. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It's been a 
long, long fight to survive at Santa Ana Valley, but we're starting to see some 
light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who will retire as Santa Ana's baseball coach after 31 seasons this year, 
said the system is relatively new in the district but incoming freshmen have 
been able to choose their high school within the district "for as long as I can 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
"All they have to do is fill out the forms and they're in," Ross said. "Now, we 
have the strand system, but a kid can take basically the same courses at any 
school in the district and graduate and that's what makes the whole thing 
absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been problems with Santa Ana Valley athletes coming to Santa Ana in 
the past. We've gotten a lot of Valley athletes. But we've also lost athletes. 
I don't know how many of our athletes have gone to Foothill under an 
intra-district transfer." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches fear Century, a new school with a beautiful gymnasium that opened 
with freshmen and sophomores last fall, will become the magnet school for 
athletes in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Century has been perceived as the school where smart kids attend," Ross said. 
"It's too early to tell if it's going to become an athletic power, but let's 
suppose it does. What's going to happen to the kids who live within the 
school's attendance area, but they can't attend the school because it's 
overcrowded. That could happen."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
TITAN FOOTBALL SHORT ON PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has dubbed its May 5 intra-squad football scrimmage the May 
Bowl, but a more appropriate name might be the Maybe Bowl -- as in maybe 
they'll have it if there's enough players. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans began spring practice Monday with 44 players, 20-25 fewer than Coach 
Gene Murphy usually has in the spring. Twenty-three seniors, including 16 
starters, from last season's 6-4-1 team are gone, leaving Murphy with a major 
rebuilding job. 
</P>
<P>
And hardly the tools to start. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have any injuries, it might be sayonara for that game," Murphy said. 
"We're not going to do a lot of hitting this spring. We're just going to teach 
them the system." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of the system, though, won't give the Titans any more game 
experience. As Murphy says, "It's one thing to go out and play against 
yourself; it's another to line up against another team." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when the other team is Auburn or Mississippi State, which both loom 
on Fullerton's September schedule. The Titans open the 1990 season at home 
against Sonoma State, then travel to Auburn, Mississippi State and Akron. 
</P>
<P>
"To say this season will be a challenge is the understatement of the year," 
Murphy said. "I hope we come out of the first four weeks as physically capable 
as possible. If we're emotionally inept after those four weeks, we're going to 
have some problems. It will be interesting to see how we react to that 
adversity." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-hat zone: There will be some serious construction going on at Fullerton 
this month, but we're not talking about the Titan Sports Complex. Murphy is 
attempting to build a team from the raw materials he has in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
The offense returns only two starters, wide receiver J.J. Celestine and guard 
Shannon Illingworth. Among the departed are quarterback Dan Speltz, who threw 
for 2,671 of the team's 2,695 passing yards, and running back Mike Pringle, who 
gained 1,727 of Fullerton's 1,793 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the top seven receivers from last season are gone, including 
record-setter Rocky Palamara, who caught 69 passes for 1,024 yards and 10 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Four defensive starters -- cornerbacks Terry Tramble and Nuygen Pendleton, 
tackle Dave Dorf and end Clarence Siler -- return, but the Titans lost inside 
linebacker Russ Oleyer, who set a school record with 129 tackles last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never lost this many starters in one year," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to fill some of the voids are senior quarterback Paul Schulte, who 
appeared in only three games last season, completing two of three passes for 24 
yards, and senior running back Deon Thomas, who rushed for 101 yards in 24 
carries in 1989. Schulte is expected to be challenged by redshirt freshman 
Terry Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Potential starting offensive linemen are Dave Collins, Bill Huston, Chris 
McFadden, Tim Drevno and John Cotti. Potential defensive starters are linemen 
Gary Thornton and J.C. Farrow, linebackers Chad Lindsay and Teddy McMillan, and 
defensive backs Mike Jones, Bob Baiz and Darrell Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy won't have to worry about is the kicking game. Returning starter Phil 
Nevin will miss spring drills because he's playing on the Titans' baseball 
team, but he'll be back this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"This year reminds me a lot of 1980 when I first came here," Murphy said. 
"Except I know all the coaches' and players' names this year." 
</P>
<P>
Some relief: Fullerton's financially strapped athletic program got some good 
news this week: a windfall of about $73,400, thanks mainly to Nevada Las Vegas' 
success in the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
With UNLV winning the national title Monday night, UC Santa Barbara reaching 
the second round and New Mexico State making the tournament, the Big West 
Conference will earn an estimated $2.3 million, according to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Big West's revenue-sharing plan, UNLV will pocket about $1 million, 
Santa Barbara will make about $435,400, and New Mexico State will make about 
$244,400. The other seven schools each will make about $73,400, and the 
conference will receive $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said the school had budgeted $14,000 for 
NCAA basketball tournament revenue, meaning Fullerton will have an extra 
$59,400 to play with. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the school will use the money to help offset shortfalls in this 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been rooting for UNLV all the way through," Carroll said. "This was 
definitely needed. It means a lot to us, because this late in the fiscal year 
it's difficult to reduce expenses. We were looking at the possibility of having 
to borrow more money, but we shouldn't have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Fullerton basketball player Cedric Ceballos will play in the Orlando 
All-Star game, a series involving many of the nation's top college players, 
April 12-15 in Florida. The Orlando event is one of three post-season 
tournaments played for the benefit of NBA and European League scouts, who use 
the games to rate potential professional players. . . . The Fullerton men's and 
women's gymnastic teams will be competing in the West Regionals on Saturday, 
the men at the University of Oklahoma and the women at UCLA. The Titan men's 
team, which is ranked fourth in the nation, will have to finish among the top 
four to qualify for the NCAA nationals, April 19-21 at Houston. If the Titan 
women, ranked 10th in the nation, finish among the top four teams, they'll 
advance to the NCAA nationals, April 20-21 at Oregon State.

FORMER TITAN STEWART SIGNS FOR TWO YEARS WITH OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alex Stewart, a former Cal State Fullerton defensive end who was released in 
November by the Dallas Cowboys, has signed two one-year contracts with the 
Houston Oilers, his agent, Jim Spellman, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Spellman, Stewart, who was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in 
the eighth round of the 1989 draft and sent to Dallas in the Herschel Walker, 
will receive about $400,000 with incentives for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opportunity for me to contribute and play a lot," said Stewart, 
who will report to the Oilers' mini-camp in May. "I'll worry about starting 
when I get there." 
</P>
<P>
Spellman said Stewart was in contention for a starting berth on the Vikings' 
defensive line in 1989 but broke his hand a few weeks before the season. He was 
traded to Dallas while he was still on the inactive list and spent his time 
there on the Cowboys' six-man development squad. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was the subject of controversy last fall when the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram, quoting a "highly placed team source," said the Cowboys cut 
Stewart in part because they suspected he was using steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that "three other league sources," none of which 
was named, confirmed that Stewart tested positive for steroids on a drug test 
administered during the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart denied those reports. "There was never a positive test and, as far as I 
know, there were no problems with the test at the combine," he said. "Whatever 
happened in Dallas is behind me, and I can't wait to play in Houston." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 6-feet-4 and 262 pounds, played at Fullerton in 1988 after 
transferring from USC. He had 21 tackles and 17 assists in eight games for the 
Titans. But Stewart's stock rose when he played well in the 1989 Blue-Gray game 
and earned defensive most valuable player honors at the 1988 Senior Bowl. MIKE

COUNTY SUPPORT FOR ARTS COUNCIL THRILLS BACKERS; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: LOCAL ARTS OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE HAPPY DESPITE ADMINISTRATIVE 
OFFICE'S RECOMMENDATION OF $235,200 LESS THAN THEY REQUESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The head of a local ad-hoc committee urging formation of a countywide arts 
service agency said Tuesday that he is "thrilled" by recommendations for a 
similar agency made Monday by the county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
The county office recommended that the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
explore development of such an agency and designate it as the board's 
"state-local" partner, or official arts representative to the state. It also 
suggested that the county use $50,000 in park funds to support the proposed 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The ad-hoc Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council had recommended a 
first-year operating budget of $285,200, with nearly half to come from the 
county. Committee Chairman Charles Desmarais said he is not bothered by the 
$235,000 difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate response is that this is fabulous," said Desmarais, director of 
the Laguna Art Museum. "The county administrative office has basically 
recommended the same things (our) committee has recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than focus on the disparity between what we wanted (and the 
administrative office's recommendations), our group will be more likely to 
focus on what high-quality art resources can we provide to our community," 
Desmarais said. 
</P>
<P>
While the committee's funding recommendations "still stand," he added, 
determination of an ongoing budget for the proposed agency should be the 
agency's own decision, and not the committee's, which plans to disband once an 
agency is formed. 
</P>
<P>
The county report was requested by Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who asked for a 
study of the county's role in arts support. Historically, county funding of the 
arts has been minimal. Riley had not read the report by Tuesday morning. A 
meeting of supervisors' aides to review the report is planned for next week, 
according to Riley aide Stephen Blanchard. No action on the recommendations is 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Desmarais answered concerns of Harvey Stearn, a California Arts 
Council member from Irvine who has said the committee's outline for an arts 
agency is too broad and may duplicate efforts of existing organizations, 
particularly Orange County's Business Committee for the Arts. Stearn is a 
longtime board member of the BCA, a nonprofit organization that encourages 
business support of the arts and offers some technical assistance to arts 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of duplicating efforts of the BCA," Desmarais said. "The 
reason that the report is extremely broad is to allow a new local arts agency 
to set a more particular agenda. We didn't want to tell another group exactly 
what to do. We wanted to say, 'Here are some basic needs that could be filled.' 
</P>
<P>
"There is a range of needs that the BCA has no interest in and no mandate to 
address," Desmarais added. "Those needs, we think, ought to be addressed by 
some other agency."

Frank Sinatra, Tracy Chapman, Billy Idol and the Bolshoi Ballet will be among 
the acts this year at the Pacific Amphitheatre, according to a schedule 
released Tuesday by the Nederlander Organization, which books and manages the 
18,764-capacity facility. 
</P>
<P>
The venue's season got off to an early start March 3 with a Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers concert. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule includes: comedian Andrew Dice Clay on April 25; Eric Clapton on 
May 4; the second annual Pacific Jazz Festival on May 19; Tracy Chapman with 
South Africa's Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka on May 26; Little Feat on June 3; the 
Benson and Hedges Blues Fest on June 9, and UB40 on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be: the Allman Brothers Band on Aug. 3; the Judds and Highway 
101 on Aug. 4; the Bolshoi Ballet on Aug. 25 and 26; the Moody Blues on Aug. 
30; K.T. Oslin and Ricky Van Shelton on Sept. 7; Frank Sinatra on Sept. 8; the 
Beach Boys on Sept. 9; the previously announced New Kids on the Block Sept 12 
and 13; Julio Iglesias on Sept. 22, and James Taylor on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Idol has been signed to appear, but a date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Pacific Jazz Festival and the Benson and Hedges blues event will have 
a mid-afternoon start time. The former will feature the Duke Ellington 
Orchestra led by Mercer Ellington; David Benoit; Larry Carlton; Diane Schuur; 
Andy Narell; Keiko Matsui; Airto and Flora Purim with Dave Valentin, and the 
Timeless All Stars with Billy Childs, Billy Higgins, Bobby Hutcherson, Harold 
Land, Julian Priester and Buster Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The blues show will feature Stevie Ray Vaughan and Joe Cocker, with the rest of 
the roster to be announced April 26. According to its producer, Darlene Chan, 
the lineup will represent blues music from "traditional to pop rock." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for some of the shows, including the jazz festival and the Clapton and 
Clay dates, already have gone on sale. Others go on sale today but only as part 
of a subscription series (call (714) 646-0850 for information). The Pacific 
will announce upcoming general sale dates and will be adding other performers 
through the season. 
</P>
<P>
The small number of contemporary rock acts in the current schedule only 
reflects the tendency of those acts to book their tours later in the season, 
Nederlander publicist Laura Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest price this season for reserved orchestra seats is $24.75, compared 
to $20.35 for some shows last year. The highest ticket prices this year are for 
the Bolshoi Ballet, which tops out at $55, and the Sinatra show at $50.

POP: GROUP'S MOVE AWAY FROM IRVINE MEADOWS TO A SOCCER FIELD IN CARSON WITH 
MORE CAPACITY WAS BASED ON ARITHMETIC RATHER THAN LAST YEAR'S PROBLEMS, A BAND 
SPOKESMAN SAID.

An Irvine Meadows official said this week that the Grateful Dead won't appear 
at the amphitheater this year because of problems that arose during the group's 
shows there last spring. But a band spokesman says the reason the group will 
play Cal State Dominguez Hills instead is more a matter of simple arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Hills "soccer field's capacity is well over 20,000. The capacity 
of Irvine Meadows is about 15,000. It's quite simple -- the place we're going 
to play this year is far more suitable," band publicist Dennis McNally said 
Monday in a phone interview from a tour stop in Atlanta. "We recognize that we 
have outgrown Irvine Meadows sizewise." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran hippie band will be at Dominguez Hills, in Carson, May 5 and 6. It 
has played Irvine Meadows every spring since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Amphitheater officials said they chose not to invite the San Francisco-based 
group back because of 91 arrests and massive traffic tie-ups that stemmed, at 
least in part, from the band's three-day stand last April. 
</P>
<P>
McNally acknowledged that the band is sensitive to problems that occurred in 
Irvine last year, including damage to crops caused by fans camping out in the 
open fields next to the amphitheater and some destruction of property in the 
Irvine Meadows parking lot where booths were set up by dozens of private 
vendors who follow the colorful band from show to show. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not ever want to be the guests that stayed too long," McNally said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, he expressed frustration that so much finger-pointing 
by Irvine city officials about overcrowded streets and freeways had been 
directed at the group when an air show held the same weekend at the nearby El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station drew tens of thousands of onlookers on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials have conceded that most of the problems would have been 
eliminated had the events been held on separate weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be real," McNally said. "There were a stunning number of people at that 
air show. I will say it was real lapse on the part of the (amphitheater) 
management not to think of that. . . . Of course, there were going to be 
problems in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the group has been drawing increasingly larger crowds since it 
bolted into the pop mainstream in 1987 by charting a hit single, "Touch of 
Grey," and its first Top 10 album since the group was formed in 1965, "In the 
Dark." 
</P>
<P>
"The last three years has been a process of accepting our dimensions and 
working with them," McNally said. "The Grateful Dead can do an enormous stadium 
show on its own now. We may not be the Rolling Stones, but we're doing pretty 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exotic and funny and colorful band, which is unusual in American 
culture in 1990 -- something that is kindly and welcome almost everywhere it 
goes. And, I might add, it's something that pours one hell of a lot of money 
into every community where it stops, to be practical for a moment." 
</P>
<P>
"The Grateful Dead has existed somewhat longer than city of Irvine (which is 
only 19 years old), and it will continue to exist," McNally said. "We're only 
interested in going where we're welcome."

His doctors advised him to cancel his schedule for two weeks.

The former President, 77, was not admitted to the hospital after the problem

Dr. Jeffrey Borer, a cardiologist at the hospital, said the ailment is a benign

SINGER SARAH VAUGHAN DIES AT 66; 
</P>
<P>
LEGENDARY PERFORMER SUCCUMBS TO LUNG CANCER AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sarah Vaughan, the legendary singer with the remarkable range and smoky 
contralto voice that earned her the nickname "The Divine One," has died of lung 
cancer. She was 66. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan, who had been released from Cedars-Sinai Hospital earlier Tuesday, 
died Tuesday night at her home in the exclusive Hidden Hills area of the 
western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Her 87-year-old mother, Ada, and her adopted daughter, Paris Deborah, were at 
her side when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Sassy" for her on-stage manner, Miss Vaughan was associated with 
recordings of such perennial jazz and pop favorites as "Body and Soul," "It's 
Magic," "Misty," "I Cover the Waterfront," "Lover Man," "Here's That Rainy Day" 
and "Send in the Clowns." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her fight with cancer, Vaughan had hoped to begin working on a new 
recording this week. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sept. 3, after Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed "Sarah Vaughan Day in Los 
Angeles," she sang with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, 
delighting 11,878 with the soaring lyric voice that made her so popular for 
nearly five decades. 
</P>
<P>
"She just kept becoming greater and greater as the years went on," Times jazz 
critic Leonard Feather, a longtime friend of Miss Vaughan's who first announced 
her death, said today. "In the last few years she was just astonishing. She was 
the idol and envy of virtually all singers." 
</P>
<P>
Feather appraised her professional versatility in his "Encyclopedia of Jazz 
Singers" by saying that she was "capable of incomparable jazz performances yet 
qualified to be an opera singer." 
</P>
<P>
That opinion was echoed today by Times music critic Martin Bernheimer, who 
reviews performances of classical music including opera: 
</P>
<P>
"Sarah Vaughan had a voice of extraordinary sweetness, flexibility and purity, 
and she used it with uncanny insinuation throughout a wide range. She could 
have taught many an opera diva lessons in breath control, in legato phrasing 
and in expressive communication. She was a great singer. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan herself had scoffed at attempts to categorize her as a jazz 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sing," she said. "I sing whatever I can." 
</P>
<P>
Born March 27, 1924, in Newark, N.J., to a carpenter and a laundress, she told 
an interviewer in her maturity that she had never even seen an opera. Her 
musical training was in the church choir with her mother, first as a singer and 
later as organist. 
</P>
<P>
She claimed that she never envisioned getting into show business, even when she 
signed up for amateur night at New York's storied Apollo Theater in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
"I just quit in the third year of high school and started singing at amateur 
hours," she once told an interviewer. "The night I won at the Apollo I was only 
doing it for the $10." 
</P>
<P>
But Billy Eckstine heard her and recommended that band leader Earl Hines hire 
her. Her career as concert and recording star was launched. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan had four husbands: trumpeter George Treadwell, former pro football 
player Clyde Atkins, Las Vegas restaurateur Marshall Fisher and musician Waymon 
Reed.

Former President Gerald R. Ford underwent surgery today to repair the left knee 
injured during his days playing football more than half a century ago, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, 76, went into surgery about 9 a.m. at Eisenhower Medical Center, said 
Penny Circle, Ford's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure, performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Robert Murphy, was expected 
to take about two hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After a four- or five-day hospital stay, Ford is expected to spend another four 
to five weeks on crutches while his leg heals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford agreed to have the elective surgery because "he's had continuing problems" 
with his left knee, problems that dated back to injuries he received when he 
played center for Grand Rapids' South High School and University of Michigan, 
where he earned All-America honors, Circle said.

CARTER MEETS WITH ARAFAT;

<P>
THEIR PARIS SESSION STIRS CONTROVERSY

PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and former President Jimmy Carter met today in an 
effort to break the stalemate in the Middle East peace process. The meeting 
outraged Israel and many French Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise development, French President Francois Mitterrand injected 
himself into the unprecedented session and met the two before their bilateral 
talks for an update "on the prospects for peace in the Middle East," the Elysee 
Palace said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel reacted to the meeting with alarm. Government officials said they had 
not been informed of the Paris talks either by Carter or by the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that gives credit to Arafat only strengthens his belief that he can 
go on with an extremist attitude," said Yosef Amihud, a spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Carter and Arafat arrived separately at the Elysee Palace for the talks shortly 
after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told reporters before the meeting that the 
three-way session "could be useful and happy" and that France hopes "to unblock 
the Middle East peace process." 
</P>
<P>
Originally the meeting was to involve only Arafat and Carter, but Mitterrand 
announced that he was taking part in the unprecedented meeting shortly after 
the arrival of the two leaders in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
Police stepped up security at Orly Airport for Arafat, who landed aboard a 
special Iraqi executive jet shortly after 4 p.m. More than 200 gendarmes and 
anti-explosives experts ringed the airport's Honor Pavilion, normally reserved 
for heads of state, where French officials met Arafat for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Carter arrived from Brussels, Belgium, a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Carter, architect of the 1978 Camp David peace accords 
and the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, unofficially is acting as an emissary 
of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is anxious to crank up talks 
between the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
A Jewish group, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, 
protested the Carter-Arafat meeting, saying it "has demanded to be received by 
Jimmy Carter to obtain clarifications" about why he agreed to meet Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
"Arafat demonstrates today to France and our fellow citizens that he only 
presents a facade of being a messenger of peace and conciliation. In reality he 
remains partisan of a murderous conflict," the group claimed in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand last May became the first major Western leader to officially receive 
Arafat, and at that time French Jews were also deeply offended. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Carter made a private tour of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Israel and 
denounced human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West 
Bank. Carter criticized Israel last month for its methods of suppressing the 
2-year-old Palestinian uprising and called for an international peace 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who mediated an Israeli-Egyptian treaty excluding Arafat from the peace 
process, said during his visit to Jerusalem last month that he saw a major role 
for the PLO in the search for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was to have met Arafat in Tunis last month but canceled the trip when 
the PLO leader went to Namibia to attend independence celebrations.

China's legislature gave final approval today to the basic law by which Beijing 
will govern Hong Kong after 1997, but Hong Kong politicians immediately 
demanded it be amended. 
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, which largely rubber-stamps decisions by top 
leaders, made no changes of its own in the law, which was thrashed out over the 
past five years by a special Chinese-Hong Kong committee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law Hong Kong, which has been ruled by Britain since 1842, is 
promised a high degree of autonomy within China and protection of its 
capitalist economic system for at least 50 years. However, many of Hong Kong's 
5.7 million residents fear that the guarantees are not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
The law provides for a 60-seat local legislature in which 20 members could be 
directly elected at first, 24 members in 1999 and 30 members in the year 2003. 
It also sets up a complicated split-voting procedure that gives appointed 
legislators power to veto controversial bills.

Police said today that a plane crash that killed two people earlier this week 
may have been a murder-suicide perpetrated by the passenger in the twin-engine 
Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman David Grimm said local authorities have asked the National 
Transportation Safety Board for permission to take control of the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Bill Layne, 56, of Aurora and a passenger died Sunday when their 
twin-engine Cessna 421 Golden Eagle crashed into a residential neighborhood in 
southwest Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
The crash destroyed several outbuildings and garages and one vacant home. A man 
who was thrown 40 feet out of his garage by the impact suffered a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
Grimm said the passenger was tentatively identified as Gordon Larry Hood, 45. 
He said Hood originally was from the Atlanta area but recently lived in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Grimm said investigators contacted two "friends and associates" of Hood's who 
live out of state and both reported that the man was suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
"The sources told us there were indications made to them that Mr. Hood was 
potentially contemplating suicide, and in a manner similar to what occurred," 
Grimm said.

<P>
Peres notified President Chaim Herzog that he has succeeded in getting majority 
backing in the 120-member Parliament, known as the Knesset, to replace the 
coalition that collapsed March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Before the announcement, observers believed Peres had only 60 assured votes. 
</P>
<P>
Israel army radio said a defector from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 
right-wing Likud bloc has signed an agreement with Labor. It identified the 
legislator as Avraham Sharir, a former tourism minister. Labor officials have 
refused comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
With a Parliament vote not likely until Sunday, Likud has time to try to lure 
Sharir and other potential Labor coalition partners back into its fold.

A woman who became one of China's most wanted fugitives after last spring's 
pro-democracy movement appeared in a dramatic videotape shown on Hong Kong 
television Tuesday night, confirming reports she has fled China with her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
The South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's largest English-language daily, said 
today that Chai Ling and her husband, Feng Chongde, 23, were in France, where a 
number of Chinese dissident leaders have taken refuge after escaping from 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Chai helped lead the movement that was suppressed June 4 when troops shot their 
way into central Beijing, driving student protesters from Tian An Men Square 
and killing hundreds of unarmed civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Chai, 23, and her husband were on a wanted list of 21 student leaders sought by 
the Chinese Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a near whisper on Hong Kong television, the haggard-looking Chai 
vowed to keep fighting for democracy and paid tribute to student leaders who 
gave their lives for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many, many people who sacrificed their lives, who shed blood, 
who shed sweat and tears, for freedom and democracy," said Chai, frequently 
pausing to hold back tears. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still in jail, or in exile, suffering the insufferable," she said. 
"Wherever you are, friends, please accept our heartfelt blessing." 
</P>
<P>
Feng sat by her side and covered his face as he wept. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-minute television tape appeared to be filmed in an apartment or hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Chinese Premier Li Peng warned France today not to let Chai and her 
husband pursue dissident activities on French soil. 
</P>
<P>
"Chai Ling and Feng Congde are wanted by the Chinese public security bureau," 
Li said at a rare news conference at the end of a two-week session of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
According to the China Times, the couple fled Beijing by train shortly after 
the June 4 crackdown. Chai and Feng soon separated and remained apart for eight 
months before reuniting two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chai was among the three most prominent student leaders of last spring's 
demonstrations. One leader, Wu'er Kaixi, fled to the West weeks after the 
crackdown. The other, Wang Dan, was captured by Chinese authorities in Beijing.

East German newspapers, despite their new look and content, are losing millions 
of readers who are unwilling to pay higher prices and are apparently switching 
to the racier West German press. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist youth daily Junge Welt reported today that 3.6 million national 
newspaper and magazine subscriptions, about one-quarter of the total, had been 
canceled recently. 
</P>
<P>
Those newspapers, once simply the mind-numbing mouthpiece of East Germany's

INSIDE TRADER BOESKY FREED AFTER 2 YEARS

<P>
Wall Street's Ivan Boesky, who went to prison two years ago for his role in the 
biggest insider-trading scandal in U.S. history, was set free today. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, once one of Wall Street's top speculators who specialized in takeover 
stocks, shocked the financial world in 1986 when he agreed to pay $100 million 
to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he 
illegally used confidential company information to make millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
He was released at 5 a.m. from a Brooklyn halfway house where he had been 
staying since December, a spokesman for the correctional center said. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky was released into home custody from the halfway house eight weeks ago. 
But he had been required to call officials there every day and stay two nights 
a week at the facility. He also had been visited by the center's staff once a 
week at his home and place of employment. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to say where Boesky was working, but he is reported to 
be living in the New York area. Boesky owns a 75-acre estate north of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, who was sent to prison March 23, 1988, spent most of his term in the 
minimum-security Lompoc Federal Prison Camp in California. Last December he was 
transferred to the Brooklyn Community Corrections Center. 
</P>
<P>
He is now required to report to a probation officer once a month for the next 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky also pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of filing false information 
with the SEC.

DOW SINKS 17.34 AMID CONCERNS OVER TOKYO

Stock prices lost ground today in a mood of caution over the touchy state of 
the Tokyo market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 36.26 points on Tuesday, dropped 
back 17.34 to 2,719.37. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 586 up, 915 down and 472 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 159.54 million shares, against 154.31 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost 1.24 to 187.31. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. stocks lately have appeared to benefit by comparison with the Tokyo 
market, which has undergone a severe shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside Japanese stocks, American issues are seen as conservatively valued in 
relation to earnings. So far the jolts in Tokyo trading have had few ripple 
effects on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
However, brokers said investors grew uneasy this afternoon as speculation 
spread that the Japanese market might be in for a further battering on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted worries over the outlook for domestic corporate profits. When 
earnings reports for the first quarter are issued over the next few weeks, they 
are expected to show the continued effects of slower growth and wary attitudes 
among consumers and business planners. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mixed in a narrow range in early trading today as the credit 
markets awaited news on two upcoming government bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or about 94 cents per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which falls when prices rise, fell to 
8.60% from 8.61% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was quiet as it waited for announcements expected in 
the afternoon on two bond issues set for next week: the Treasury's seven-year 
note auction and the Resolution Funding Corp.'s 40-year bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
The market expected the Treasury to sell $7.5 billion in seven-year notes, 
while it anticipated the savings and loan bailout agency would auction $4 
billion to $4.5 billion of its bonds. 
</P>
<P>
New bond issues would increase the supply of debt securities on the market and 
could affect prices.

Several major U.S. pension funds today threatened to topple Exxon Corp.'s board 
of directors at its annual meeting later this month if it fails to meet demands 
to make a stronger commitment to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We can talk to other funds about running our own slate of directors," said 
Gray Davis, California state controller, after a meeting with Exxon Chairman 
Lawrence G. Rawl this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a trustee of the California Public Employee Pension System, was joined 
at the meeting by representatives from New York and Massachusetts pension funds 
holding a total 14.5 million shares in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon, the world's largest oil company, last March caused one of the nation's 
worst environmental disasters when its Valdez tanker spilled 11 million gallons 
of crude oil in Alaskan waters. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Comptroller Liz Holtzman also attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that we get some commitments ahead of the annual meeting on 
April 25," Holtzman told reporters after speaking with Rawl. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon had no immediate comment on the meeting.

The New Kids on the Block -- the pop music group with hordes of screaming and 
fainting young fans -- have made it to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Concerts announced Tuesday that the New Kids will perform at Dodger Stadium 
on Friday, Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets will go on sale at Ticketmaster at 9 a.m. on Saturday, April 21, with 
all seats $25. The event will be the first local MCA Concerts promotion outside 
the Universal Amphitheatre since the 1982 Simon and Garfunkel reunion show, 
also at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The New Kids just wound up a sellout 106-date North America arena tour and are 
now on a sellout European tour. The Dodger stadium date is part of a "Magic 
Summer Tour" of 29 stadiums and 31 arenas -- including Joe Robbie Stadium in 
Miami (50,000 seats) and Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium (55,000 seats).

MICHELANGELO'S NUDES DESTROYED BY CENSORS, RESTORERS ANNOUNCE

Art restorers said Tuesday that they could not remove veils and other coverings 
added to hide nudity in Michelangelo's Last Judgment frescoes in the Sistine 
Chapel because the originals had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after a weeklong international symposium of art 
historians studying the first phase of a multimillion-dollar restoration of one 
of the world's greatest art treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year cleaning of the ceiling frescoes was completed last month and 
scaffolding has been built for a four-year project to restore a massive, 
300-figure scene depicting The Last Judgment on the wall behind the main altar. 
</P>
<P>
The 1545-1563 Council of Trent ordered that some of the nudes on The Last 
Judgment be covered. Most of the work was done by Daniele Da Volterra after 
Michelangelo died in 1564. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference marking the start of work on the 1,800-square-foot panel 
depicting Earth, Heaven and Hell, officials said the originals of the doctored 
frescoes could not be restored. 
</P>
<P>
"The additions that were painted by Daniele da Volterra shortly after 
Michelangelo's death were painted in fresco and that means that Michelangelo's 
original frescoes were taken out," said Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, the 
Vatican's consultant on Renaissance art. 
</P>
<P>
In the fresco technique, artists paint on wet plaster which becomes part of a 
wall or ceiling when dry. If Da Volterra, known as the "breechmaker" because of 
his censorship, had used a dry technique to cover the offending frescoes, 
restorers could have uncovered the original. 
</P>
<P>
In his most famous modification of The Last Judgment, Da Volterra ripped out 
the figures of St. Catherine and St. Blaise, both originally nude, and 
repainted them with flowing garments.

Lee Atwater, the Republican National Committee chairman, was up and talking a 
day after surgery in which radioactive isotopes were implanted in his brain to 
kill a tumor, a committee official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, 39, was receiving numerous visitors in a New York hospital, though 
they had to stand behind a lead shield because of radioactivity, committee 
chief of staff Mary Matalin said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Atwater came through the surgery "with flying colors" and his doctors 
point to a number of positive factors that give hope for thwarting the tumor. 
Those include his age and good physical condition as well as the size and 
location of the tumor in the right frontal lobe of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sally, who is expecting to deliver the couple's third child on 
Monday, was in New York with him.

EX-GIANT McCONKEY WILL RUN FOR CONGRESS: Just as we told you he would, former 
Giants football player Phil McConkey announced Tuesday that he's running for 
Congress as a Republican in New Jersey. He will seek the House seat vacated by 
Rep. Jim Courter, who ran unsuccessfully for governor. 
</P>
<P>
McConkey, who is currently with the San Diego Chargers, told a gathering at the 
Somerville (N.J.) Inn that he will retire from football if elected. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have criticized me for running for Congress because I wasn't born 
in New Jersey," said the Vietnam veteran. "Well, I bet my grandmother in Italy 
and my grandfather in Ireland never dreamed I might someday be in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
His opponent for the GOP nomination, Rodney P. Frelinghuysen III, traces his 
family to the Mayflower. 
</P>
<P>
Phil, now living in Flemington, N.J., made the announcement with his father, 
Ed, and his girlfriend, model Diane Arabia, at his side. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, the ex-Buffalo Bills quarterback, urged him to run. "I 
told him that seats in Congress don't open up that often," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
RON'S LETTER MAY FETCH SMALL FORTUNE: Back in '62, the note was just a friendly 
missive from a movie star to a frustrated playwright. But a lot has happened to 
Ronnie Reagan since he starred on TV's "G.E. Theater." And now, the Herman 
Darvick autograph people figure the note may fetch $1,800 at Thursday night's 
auction in the Sheraton City Squire Inn. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was written in April, 1962, to a "Miss White," who'd sent him a 
play. "I must apologize for not getting back to you sooner about your play 
which you kindly forwarded," wrote Reagan. "Frankly, I was motivated by 
selfishness. Since Jan., we've been hanging motionless waiting to see if there 
would be a G.E. Theater next year. Now the ax has fallen. . . . I hope you 
won't mind but now that I know we aren't in the market, I'm taking your play to 
another producer whose show is going &amp; who might be interested." 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT: Hey, Broadway. Think small. At least musically, says 
Martin Charnin, because most of the big houses are occupied with hits. That's 
why Charnin, Jimmy Webb and Peter Stone are writing a "small piece for 10 to 12 
actors" called "Love Me, Love My Dog." Marty will direct, Peter will write the 
book and lyrics, and Jimmy will do the score. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter found an old play by Bill Manhoff, who wrote 'The Owl and the Pussycat,' 
" Charnin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very strange, exotic and bizarre little adventure. It'll be done 
sometime in our immediate lifetimes but all things being equal, that'll be late 
next season."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: POPULAR ANTIDEPRESSANT PROZAC CARRIES SOME CAUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, AND TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>

<P>
The hot drug of the 1970s was Valium (diazepam). At its peak, more than 60 
million prescriptions were filled each year. People treated the little blue or 
yellow pills almost as casually as aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Xanax took over top billing for psychoactive drugs. Now a new 
contender is grabbing the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Valium and Xanax, the superstar drug of the 1990s does not relieve 
anxiety. It is an antidepressant, a type of medicine that's long been regarded 
by both doctors and patients as necessary but unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Previous antidepressants saved people from suicide and helped them shake off 
the immobility of despair, but they rarely made people feel great. 
</P>
<P>
Many antidepressants left people feeling sluggish and "spaced out." People 
often gained weight and developed a dry mouth, constipation, disturbed 
concentration and sexual dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Prozac (fluoxetine), the new head drug of the '90s, doesn't cause weight gain 
or sedation. And it has received far more recognition than any other 
antidepressant. With cover stories in Newsweek and New York magazine, Prozac 
has become a household name. Sales zoomed to $350 million last year, more than 
double the previous year's total. 
</P>
<P>
There's a reason for such popularity. Cheryl was overweight, depressed, tired a 
lot of the time and compulsive about neatness. Her son's messy room drove her 
wild. To keep everything in its place, she spent hours each day tidying up. It 
was a constant source of friction. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor had tried her on amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, but it 
made her fatigue and weight problem worse. She decided she could live with the 
depression rather than gain more weight. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Prozac was introduced, her doctor wrote her a prescription. It 
changed Cheryl's life. She felt energetic and optimistic and stopped screaming 
at her family. 
</P>
<P>
An added bonus -- she started to lose weight for the first time in years. But 
there is a darker side to Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Valium and Xanax lost popularity as people learned about complications, 
Prozac may lose its glamour when people realize there are side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Some people develop insomnia and feel jittery and anxious. Nausea, tremors, 
sweating and sexual problems are also possible. 
</P>
<P>
More disturbing is the report that Prozac may lead a small number of people to 
consider suicide. Harvard researchers recently reported six cases in which 
patients on Prozac developed "intense, violent suicidal thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company sees "no trend that Prozac has 
any relationship to suicide, suicide ideation, attempts or successful suicides 
any more than other therapeutic interventions in patients with depression." 
</P>
<P>
As popular as Prozac is becoming, no one yet knows the long-term safety of this 
antidepressant.

gall bladder. Rice said Tuesday that the conditions are unrelated.

PHILADELPHIAN TO CONSOLIDATE GATHERS' CASES

<P>
A Philadelphia attorney was appointed today to serve as a temporary 
administrator in California of the estate of the late college basketball star 
Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
A legal battle surrounding the death of the Loyola Marymount star erupted 
earlier this week with attorneys representing Gathers' son fighting to be 
appointed to administrate the estate, which at this time has little value. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, one of the nation's leading collegiate players and a top professional 
prospect, collapsed during a game March 4 at Loyola's Gersten Pavilion and died 
shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
He had been diagnosed earlier in the season as having heart problems but was 
given medication and cleared to play. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Nunan, a lawyer representing Gathers' brother, Derrick, argued that a 
neutral party should be appointed administrator, contending that the 
Philadelphia attorney, Martin Krimsky, has ties to Gathers' son, who is a 
potential heir, thereby creating a possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Commissioner Robert Blaylock said he found Krimsky "to be a 
man of integrity and good and impartial judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock added it would be less confusing to have Krimsky administer the estate 
temporarily because he already was appointed administrator of Gathers' estate 
by a court in Philadelphia, Gathers' home city.

NAVRATILOVA DESPERATE FOR VICTORY ON CLAY COURT

Top-seeded Martina Navratilova says she needs to win on clay if she is going to 
wrest the No. 1 women's tennis ranking from Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
But Navratilova, who has not won a clay court tournament in nearly two years, 
is not making any predictions about this week's $500,000 Family Circle Magazine 
Cup, where she is the top seed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking down the road too far. I've just got to get back and think 
about every match," she said after defeating Halle Cioffi 6-2, 6-1 Tuesday in 
the second round of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova was to return to action today against Isabel Cueto, the No. 12 
seed. The No. 2 seed -- Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario -- opens play in the tournament 
against Mary Lou Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria defeated Linda Harvey-Wild of Hawthorn Woods, 
Ill., 6-1, 6-2 today in a second-round match. Maleeva, ranked 10th in the world 
and seeded fifth in this event, had a first-round bye, and Harvey-Wild easily 
won her opening match 6-0, 6-1 over Hellas Ter Riet. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati was scheduled to play a second-round match later today 
against Angeliki Kanellopoulou of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said her toughest competition this time is "my next round. I can 
have stiff competition from a lot of people. A lot of players are good on this 
stuff, and they play on it more than I do."

FALDO CALM, COLLECTED ABOUT DEFENDING TITLE

Nick Faldo is upbeat and unworried about the burden of defending his Masters 
golf title this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure on me to repeat," the 32-year-old Englishman said Tuesday, 
two days before the start of the 1990 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's only been done by Jack," he explained, referring to Jack Nicklaus, the 
only player to win back-to-back Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm able to forget about last year. Once I start out there, it's all fresh," 
said Faldo, who won the green jacket of the Masters champion last year with a 
birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff with Scott Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, the 1985 British Open champion, acknowledged that he is in a good 
position to take a casual attitude toward winning the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling better than I did last year," he told reporters after a practice 
round over the 6,905-yard course at the Augusta National Golf Club, permanent 
home of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel well prepared. It's just a matter of being relaxed and going out and 
playing," Faldo added. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating as Masters champion has proved almost impossible over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bobby Jones founded the tournament in 1934, only Nicklaus has managed the 
feat -- in 1965 and 1966. He had to survive an 18-hole playoff with Tommy 
Jacobs and Gay Brewer to do it. 
</P>
<P>
When Sandy Lyle, Faldo's Scottish nemesis, returned to Augusta last year after 
winning his green jacket in 1988, he failed to make the cut with rounds of 77 
and 76. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros, the brilliant Spaniard considered to be one of the world's 
best golfers, won the Masters in 1980 and 1983 and he, too, failed to make the 
cut the following years.

Massachusetts lottery officials said today that a proposed football card 
betting game could net $40 million a year, but a National Football League 
executive said it would cheapen the sport. Lottery Director James Hosker said 
the game, similar to Oregon's, would also put a dent in illegal gambling by 
providing a legal outlet for those who like to bet on football cards. 
</P>
<P>
"In Massachusetts, pool card betting is very popular," Hosker said at a hearing 
of the Legislature's Government Regulations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The football betting bill is sponsored by Rep. William Galvin (D-Boston), House 
chairman of the committee and a candidate for state treasurer. The treasurer's 
office oversees the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Moyer, executive vice president of the National Football League, 
accompanied by New England Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan, strongly opposed 
the bill. "Legalizing sports gambling will threaten public confidence in the 
integrity of professional football," Moyer said.

GULFSTREAM'S DATE CHANGES A BLOW TO HIALEAH

The feud among South Florida's three thoroughbred tracks intensified when 
Gulfstream Park made a last-minute switch in its racing dates for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
The change, which came just before Monday's deadline for South Florida's three 
tracks to submit their dates, defeated Hialeah Park's plan to race unopposed at 
least one day a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's despicable," said John Brunetti Sr., owner of financially troubled 
Hialeah Park. "I think it's a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah, which closed abruptly Dec. 18 under the duress caused by declines in 
wagering and attendance, submitted an application calling for three-day-a-week 
racing -- Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays -- from Dec. 22 to April 8. The idea 
was that while Hialeah would compete on the weekend dates, it would have 
Mondays to itself. 
</P>
<P>
Mondays traditionally are off days at Gulfstream and Calder Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
But Gulfstream officials adjusted their weekly racing schedule for next year so 
that Wednesdays, not Mondays, would be the off days, at least until April. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a deliberate effort on their part to make any possibility of our being 
economically successful fail at the outset," Brunetti said. "No matter what 
days or dates we asked for, they would continue to take every opportunity to do 
whatever they possibly could do to squelch Hialeah's chances for a successful 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah is scheduled to open in the midst of Calder's meeting, which starts May 
5 and runs through Jan. 13. Gulfstream will then open and race until it is 
Calder's turn again. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah has no time just to itself. 
</P>
<P>
"From a business and competitive standpoint," Gulfstream attorney David Romanik 
said, "it did not make sense for us to compete with Hialeah on our two best 
days (Saturday and Sunday) and then allow Hialeah to operate uncontested on 
Mondays."

Persecution against Jews came early into conductor Ami Porat's childhood in 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"There were daily anti-Semitic attacks, even from little kids who obviously 
repeated what they heard from their parents," Porat said in a recent phone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a 4-year-old boy who lived in our building, who used to throw rocks 
at us daily when we came home from school, 'You dirty Jews, get out of my 
country.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And I remember the insults that even the teachers inflicted on us. How would 
you like to be called (in class), 'the Jew Ami Porat'? 
</P>
<P>
"We had no other choice but to get straight A's. That they couldn't take away." 
</P>
<P>
Porat, the son of survivors of the Holocaust, grew up in Cluj, the capital of 
Transylvania. His mother had been in Auschwitz and his father had been taken to 
the Ukraine. "They found each other after the war," Porat said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled the mood of his hometown: "There was a great mentality of siege 
because of the bleak economy and widespread anti-Semitism. We were forced to 
expand and beautify our inner world. We had very few avenues of expression 
left." 
</P>
<P>
Classical music was one of the open avenues of expression, but even so, Porat 
recalled, the authorities "put incredible obstacles in our way." 
</P>
<P>
"I started on the piano, when I was about 9 or 10. I wanted to play a string 
instrument. I was taken to a concert, fell in love and wanted to play the 
cello. But they would not let me play the cello. There were two kids in my 
class who already played cello. It was too late for that. The only instrument I 
could learn was the double-bass. I didn't choose it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Politics soon entered Porat's life, too. His father was an avid fisherman whose 
hobby was to make artificial lures and flies. Word spread, and friends and 
neighbors would come by to get the gear. 
</P>
<P>
"Many insisted upon paying him something -- pennies, no way it was proper 
compensation," Porat said, though it provided enough money to buy a modest 
piano, which was later confiscated by the police. 
</P>
<P>
"When we applied to emigrate, my father was called up to the offices of the 
Securitate. They showed him a list of every single person who had ever given 
him money for his fishing flies. They said this was illegal, a crime against 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
"They had two choices, they said: They could put him away for life; or he could 
emigrate, but he would have to do some industrial spying for them. They wanted 
some pictures of (military) installations in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave him the name of a contact and a telephone number in an embassy. . . 
. He, of course, accepted on the spot. One chooses freedom over life in 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
The Porats, like the Schwartzes and others, had to buy their way out of the 
country, despite the "agreement" with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The government made you pay -- $10,000 per person -- for the privilege, for 
the right to renounce Romanian citizenship," he said. "Our house was 
confiscated. We were allowed to leave with about 50 pounds of personal 
belongings each. When we got to the border, I remember throwing cash out the 
train, Romanian currency because we weren't allowed to be caught with it." 
</P>
<P>
The family arrived in Israel on May 1, 1961. Porat was 14 1/2. The next month, 
his father tried to call his spy contact at a Western embassy as prearranged. 
</P>
<P>
"By tremendous coincidence, there had been a natural gas explosion in the 
embassy," Porat said. "The contact vanished, and my father was free." 
</P>
<P>
Why did his father even try to keep his end of the bargain? 
</P>
<P>
"There were lots of family members still left in Romania," Porat said. "There 
was a claim against all the land . . . also, they told my father (that) they 
had 'very long arms.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to describe the feeling of living in a police state for 20 
years," he added. "Believe me, everybody was afraid. There were informants of 
the Securitate everywhere. We lived in a U-shaped building, with maybe 30 to 40 
families. Every one of the buildings had at least one or two informants." 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Porat went to a kibbutz called Givat-Haim (the Hill of Life). His 
parents remained in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
The kibbutz members heard him improvising at a piano one night and decided to 
send him back to his family so he could pursue music. 
</P>
<P>
"Slowly, slowly my chains fell off," he said. "My mother says my posture 
improved. I was no longer standing beaten down. I was standing tall and proud." 
</P>
<P>
He joined the National Youth Orchestra in 1963 and toured with it to North 
America and Canada a year later. He went on to attend a music academy in Tel 
Aviv, was drafted into the Israeli army and in 1969, won a scholarship to the 
Juilliard School of Music in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, he has lived in Orange County. He formed the Mozart Camerata in 
1980 as a private organization; in 1985 it was reorganized and began to give 
public concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Like his compatriot Sergiu Schwartz, Porat would like to return to Romania now 
that the move toward democracy has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a desire to go back and see the place I was born," he said. "Also I 
want to see the place where I got my first music lessons. I want to see the 
cathedral in the center square, where I used to lean out the window to see the 
time . . . and also I want to see where I caught my first fish with my father."

Violinist Sergiu Schwartz remembers the Romanian secret police -- the 
Securitate -- imprisoning his father for two years on a charge that was never 
made clear. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mozart Camerata founding music director Ami Porat remembers the Securitate 
offering his father a choice between life imprisonment or serving as a spy for 
the Romanian state. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But such memories come reluctantly -- neither musician likes to talk about his 
childhood in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to publicize these things too much," Schwartz said. "It is so 
private, and it is absurd for anyone living in the West to think about such 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"But since everyone now has heard about this Romanian revolution, how bloody it 
was, how people could no longer stand it, the awareness of the American people 
and the Free World has gotten to the point where there is some interest and 
understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Porat said simply: "I have very few memories, and it is quite obvious that my 
mind is filtering them." (See related story on F3.) 
</P>
<P>
The two musicians will be heard together in concert Saturday at St. Andrew's

Born in Bucharest in 1957, Schwartz showed an early interest in music. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have driven my parents crazy with my noises," Schwartz said in a recent 
phone interview from a friend's home in Beverly Hills. "I would pick anything 
that would make a sound and play it. 
</P>
<P>
"Father gave me a toy violin when I was 5 or 6, thinking (my interest in it) 
was one of those things that comes and goes. I got angry and immediately 
smashed it and asked them to give me a real one." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's parents were quite poor and could scarcely afford to buy a violin. 
Still, his father brought in a teacher to test him. 
</P>
<P>
"After he had played a little for me, I wanted to do the same thing. I imitated 
him, like a monkey does. He whispered to my father -- I found out many years 
later -- , 'If you don't buy it, I will give it to you, because it would be a 
crime not to let him study.' " 
</P>
<P>
But this seemingly idyllic world soon began to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole environment is difficult for a child to notice," he said. "If you 
are born in a prison and you don't see the light outside, you cannot compare it 
to a better life. . . . You simply don't know what you're missing. 
</P>
<P>
"And obviously, under the Communist regime, people had to suffer a lot, and 
being a Jewish minority, this added more suffering and persecution. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't take me too many years to find out I was rejected by that society 
because (of my) ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
"I taught myself three languages -- English, French and German -- to read the 
books and the magazines that were coming from the outside. Soon I realized the 
possibilities are tremendous. . . . My mind was set on getting out of Romania." 
</P>
<P>
The family tried for many years to leave the country, an effort that drew the 
attention of the authorities. About this time, Schwartz's father was imprisoned 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know why,"Schwartz said. "At that time, people would say 
something, and they would be imprisoned. He was labeled a 'revisionist.' I 
don't know what that is." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that when the police came, "they took (virtually) everything." 
</P>
<P>
"They left us with a bed, a table and some chairs," he said. "There were two 
more things they wanted to take away -- one was my violin and the other was a 
little bicycle I was riding. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that our Romanian Christian neighbors abhored the way they behaved 
and begged the officers, 'Take anything you want but leave the violin and the 
bicycle.' They left them. I'm very grateful to such people. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's father was held incommunicado for a week. "We didn't know if he was 
alive or where he was." 
</P>
<P>
The next two years were terrible for him and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have much to eat," Schwartz remembered. 
</P>
<P>
After his father was released, his mother became ill with cancer and died a few 
years later. In 1973, Schwartz and his father at last were allowed to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
He says that their freedom "was bought." 
</P>
<P>
"I found out much later that for every Jew who got out of Romania, there was 
price on this, from $2,000 to more than $10,000. Everyone paid to get out of 
Romania. . . . Part of this price was all our savings. We were left with not 
one cent." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the upheavals in making a transition from one kind of society to 
another, Schwartz described his arrival in Israel as "my second chance in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't describe it in any other way," he said. "When I got there, my 
dreams were fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
He received music training in Israel and went on to study in Germany and at the 
Juilliard School of Music in New York under the sponsorship of Isaac Stern's 
Israel-American Cultural Foundation. He has won several international 
competitions and made his debut at Carnegie Hall in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 33, though he is a citizen of Israel (which means he can be summoned 
back into the army in case of a national emergency), he also maintains a 
residence in New York, where his management is based. 
</P>
<P>
In January, he gave a recital in London, "a few days after they executed the 
dictator (Nicolae Ceausescu). 
</P>
<P>
"We donated all the proceeds to a newly formed committee for the (Romanian) 
people who had suffered and who needed immediate help. I was very glad to do 
it. All the ex-Romanian artists in Europe are doing the same. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have many good things to say about the state where I was born. I only 
would add, I don't have resentments. I don't take it personally. There were 
many other people suffering, and everyone was suffering in silence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(But) I would like very much to go back and remind the people there that we 
haven't forgotten them, that they have a better future and that things will get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they are still suffering the consequences of the upheaval. It is 
not easy for them to (transform) a totalitarian system to a democratic one. 
They've never known the meaning of freedom. It will take time."
