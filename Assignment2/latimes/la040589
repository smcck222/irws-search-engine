SLIGHT RATE DROP FORECAST FOR S.D. IN UTILITY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state study released Tuesday concludes that the proposed merger of San Diego 
Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison would result in a modest 
drop in rates for San Diegans and a rate increase for SCE customers. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-page report, prepared by the Assembly Office of Research, also projected 
that without a takeover by Edison, San Diego rates would rise because 
increasing demand will force the utility to add considerably to its generation 
capacity in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
As for the potential acquisition of SDG&amp;E by a public agency, the study 
called it feasible but said the impact of such a move cannot be fully evaluated 
until a purchase price for the utility is set by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requested by Killea 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted at the request of Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San 
Diego), who called it "the first independent analysis" of how rates would be 
affected under several different scenarios for the future of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that it was "not conclusive," Killea said the study will 
help government leaders and consumer advocates better evaluate the merger 
proposal -- an issue she said was ablaze in a "firestorm of controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Killea said one conclusion she reached after reviewing the report was that cost 
savings realized by a merger would be nominal. SCE has projected that the 
takeover would result in savings of $1.7 billion over 10 years. If those 
figures are accurate, a $50 monthly utility bill would be reduced to $49, 
Killea said. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that is enough, by itself, to win the hearts of San Diegans," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Raised 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the savings might be "offset" by problems created by the merger, 
which, if approved by the Public Utilities Commission, would form the largest 
investor-owned power company in the United States. Such problems include 
"questionable commitments to preserving San Diego's air quality and obvious 
disincentives to maintaining fair competition in the energy marketplace," 
Killea said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the study's key findings was the prediction that SDG&amp;E ratepayers 
would see a drop in rates if the two companies joined, while SCE customers 
would have higher bills. That projection drew mixed responses Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It think that shows this deal would not be a win-win situation as the 
utilities have painted it all along," said Michael Shames, executive director 
of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumers group. 
"This shows us that someone is going to lose if the merger happens. And it 
doesn't look like it will be the utilities, either." 
</P>
<P>
Edison executives, meanwhile, disputed the study's gloomy news for SCE 
customers. While they were "delighted" by predictions of cost-savings for San 
Diegans, the officials insisted all of their energy consumers would enjoy lower 
rates because of the cost savings that would be realized under a united 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
"SCE customers will not be disadvantaged because operating costs for the merged 
company will be lower than for the two companies operating separately," said 
Lewis Phelps, SCE's manager of corporate communications. "We will demonstrate 
this conclusively in a filing we will make shortly with the PUC." 
</P>
<P>
The study predicted that without the merger, SDG&amp;E rates would rise in the 
future. But when measured in real dollars adjusted for inflation, the increases 
would not represent any significant change from current levels, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how a takeover of SDG&amp;E by a public agency would affect 
ratepayers went mostly unanswered in the report -- largely because rates would 
depend on the as-yet-unknown purchase price for SDG&amp;E, estimated at between 
$4.3 billion and $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
More definitive data on that issue is likely to come out of a study being 
conducted by the San Diego County Water Authority, which has expressed interest 
in taking over and running SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of those seeking to thwart the $2.4-billion corporate takeover by 
Rosemead-based SCE found cause for optimism in the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Municipalization Feasible' 
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that municipalization is feasible and we're certainly encouraged 
by that," said Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor. 
"But we're taking the results with a grain of salt. It's just one report and we 
have a two-year process ahead before the PUC makes its decision." 
</P>
<P>
The study noted that the impact of any organizational framework on rates is 
minimal, largely because the vast majority of electricity costs are tied to 
fuel, generating plants, transmission lines and other factors not directly 
related to the corporate structure. 
</P>
<P>
Given the small difference in rates, the report suggested that factors such as 
air pollution, economic impacts, loss of jobs and reliability of service are 
key ingredients to an evaluation of utility mergers.

DROPOUT RATE RISES AT CITY SCHOOLS DESPITE NEW PREVENTION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the San Diego Board of Education expressed frustration Tuesday as 
they learned that the number of students dropping out of city schools increased 
during the 1987-88 school year despite increased money and attention for 
programs to fight the trend. 
</P>
<P>
The board's chagrin at the numbers -- 7.5% of students in grades 9 through 12, 
contrasted with about 7% the year before -- was more than matched by the anger 
of representatives from the city's black community over the 8.7% dropout rate 
for those students and a 12.3% rate for Latinos. The black rate showed an 
increase of 20.9% over the 1986-87 figure. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout report raises fears that the San Diego Unified School District -- 
the nation's eighth-largest, with 117,000 students -- will be unable to meet 
its goal of reducing the dropout rate by 50% by the end of the 1989-90 school 
year. The 7.5% one-year rate announced Tuesday represents about a 6% jump over 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. Tom Payzant called the news discouraging, but tried to soften the 
impact by pointing out that at least four major dropout prevention and recovery 
programs began only last fall, and thus their impact -- if any -- will not be 
seen until figures for the present academic year are collected and reported 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there is no evidence that tougher academic standards put into 
effect by the district over the past two years have had a substantial impact on 
increasing the number of students leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
But both board members and black community speakers took little solace from 
Payzant's remarks, and the subsequent two-hour discussion showed how the 
dropout problem relates to almost every substantive issue that has been before 
trustees during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Curriculum. Trustee Shirley Weber said that too few blacks and Latinos are 
being adequately prepared in reading and other subjects at the elementary 
level, meaning high schools have the Herculean job of trying to "turn around" 
students at the ninth-grade level and teach them basic skills. And, while the 
dropout rate historically has remained about the same, the number of 
blue-collar career jobs available for failed students has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
* Teacher attitudes and willingness to consider different learning styles of 
children. Weber and Urban League President Herb Cawthorne said that too many 
teachers look on black students with fear or skepticism, believing they come 
with too many social problems to be able to learn at high levels. Weber said 
black students receive a disproportionate number of referrals, or problem 
slips, from teachers, and are double other ethnic groups in being placed in 
special education programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Classes Urged 
</P>
<P>
* Class size. Several board members suggested that smaller class size would 
allow teachers to give more attention to students needing help or special 
encouragement. National research shows that students who drop out often cite a 
lack of a teacher or other adult who cared whether they did well. Weber said 
the district might pilot smaller elementary school class sizes, which now 
average 33 students. 
</P>
<P>
* Middle schools. The district report says that ninth-graders attending a 
four-year high school drop out at twice the rate of ninth-graders at a junior 
high school. Board President Susan Davis said the data points toward changing 
the way ninth-grade instruction is handled at high schools to encourage more 
individual attention. 
</P>
<P>
* Parent involvement. While the district has stressed parent involvement as a 
critical component of learning, the Urban League's Cawthorne said that too many 
parents in Southeast San Diego themselves had poor experiences with school. 
Administrators cannot expect parents to turn the situation around in a major 
way, he said, and the schools must therefore reach out to other community 
groups as well. 
</P>
<P>
* Preschool education. Payzant said that more money for Head Start and other 
preschool programs would be the best way to stem the number of dropouts over 
the long haul. Data shows that educational and other nurturing during a child's 
first five years of life can have a profound impact, he said. However, such 
programs cost money, and the district is facing budget cuts to existing 
programs for next year.

AIDS PATIENT FINDS A HAVEN AT TRUAX HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Ferrara sat by the window, smoking cigarettes. Through the plume of smoke, 
he watched planes taking off from nearby Lindbergh Field. He said the noise 
didn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
To see planes taking off meant that people were alive, taking trips, seeing 
loved ones. And the smoke, well, he said, it's one of life's few remaining 
pleasures. Give him smoke, you give him life. And don't you dare take it away. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara, 32, has AIDS. He is pallid and frail and doesn't know how much longer 
he has to live. He sat near the television, watching "The Young and the 
Restless." Before too long, he would tune in "One Life to Live." Not a day goes 
by that he doesn't watch both. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Ferrara is the only tenant of Truax House, a residential hospice 
center for AIDS patients that opened last month. It is named in honor of Dr. 
Brad Truax, who died of AIDS-related complications late last year. Truax's 
portrait hangs in the foyer of the colonial-style home, which is almost a 
century old. The house is high on a hill at the corner of Laurel and Union 
streets, near Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
As Ferrara said, "You can see the world from here." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wilson, housing director of the AIDS Assistance Fund, said the role of 
Truax House is "to provide a secure, homelike setting for victims of AIDS and 
ARC (AIDS-related complex). Here, they don't have to worry about being kicked 
out. They won't be evicted because of their sickness, or because they're gay." 
</P>
<P>
Before too long, the house, which has a capacity of 10 residents, will be full 
-- full of men like Ferrara who are dying, who have weeks or days to live and 
want a 
</P>
<P>
haven in which to spend their final moments. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said it's important that the house reflect the spirit of Truax, who had 
been a leader in the gay community and the Democratic Party, a "man who cared 
about decency and human rights." Truax never lived in the house, which was 
donated by the city of San Diego through the San Diego Housing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding and Donations 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that funding for Truax House comes from the Office of AIDS, a state 
agency, as well as the county. The furnishings in the four-bedroom home, all of 
which were donated, are worth about $100,000, including $5,000 worth of 
paintings. The house itself, Wilson said, is valued at more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Truax House is managed by the AIDS Assistance Fund, which was set up five years 
ago to deal with the needs of "clients" who have AIDS. Wilson said the fund 
provides a food bank, a chaplaincy program and counseling. He said the 
requirements for tenants of Truax House are "mobility . . . they have to be 
ambulatory. We do have nurses for each client, but we're not set up to be a 
24-hour care facility. If their conditions worsen or become severe, they go to 
a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that Truax House is one of five such hospices in the county, but it 
is different in being limited to 10 residents and in offering "more of a 
homelike setting." He said that residents are required to pay rent of $325 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reduces the Stress' 
</P>
<P>
"I love it here," Ferrara said. "The atmosphere is what I need. It's peaceful 
and relaxed. The worst part of AIDS for me is stress. This place reduces the 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
"I was diagnosed as having AIDS in 1987 and moved (to San Diego) in February of 
last year. I had to leave New York, where I'm from, because the center where I 
was living didn't want an AIDS patient. The worst for me was March and April of 
'88, when I had a temperature of 104 and came down with tuberculosis and viral 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I need transfusions, but my blood levels are too low, so they won't 
give them to me. I can't take AZT (which reduces the effects of AIDS) for the 
same reason. I'm very depressed, but the anti-depressants I'm taking won't take 
effect for months. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the depression this brings on. I hate the funerals. They get me very 
upset. I like to be with people who have AIDS -- they understand -- but I hate 
to talk about AIDS. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Somehow, just hearing 
about it makes it worse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Has Been There 
</P>
<P>
Craigory Jones, 25, works in Truax House as a volunteer. His face is narrow and 
gaunt and punctuated by a large earring that dangles from his left ear. He was 
diagnosed as having AIDS three years ago. At one time, he was in a wheelchair 
for six months. But now, aside from being stick-figure thin, he bears no overt 
signs of illness. 
</P>
<P>
"During my worst period, I was on a respirator," Jones said. "I had collapsed 
lungs. The nerves in my legs were shot. I couldn't really move my legs. The 
worst of this for me has been the cycles you go through -- shame, denial, 
frustration, anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the Army at one time. I'm more than just a gay male," he added with a 
laugh. "I had two wives, and I have two children, ages 4 and 6. One marriage 
was annulled after two weeks, but the other one lasted a while. I was out of 
the closet for a year before I learned I have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"My children know that I have AIDS, and I've tried to explain it -- how and why 
I got it. I'll take a stick to them if they ever become gay" -- he laughed -- 
"although I don't feel regret about coming out, despite the illness. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first learned I had it, I did feel that -- you look for something to 
blame it on. But if there's anything positive about AIDS, it's that it puts you 
in closer touch with what life is all about. It makes you appreciate the life 
you have left."

HOME(LESS) VIEWING: REAL ESTATE SHOW AIDS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood may never come knocking at the door of Father Joe Carroll or the St. 
Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc Center in downtown San Diego. But cable TV did. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who is president of the homeless shelter, announced at a press 
conference Tuesday that he is the host of "The Real Estate Show," which made 
its debut Saturday night. Between the showcasing of San Diego County homes, 
Carroll will showcase the services the center provides to the area's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which will reach about 172,000 homes in the county on cable 
Channels 15, 4 and 11, is being produced by MCA Mortgage Counselors of America, 
a division of Shaughnessy's Inc. Owners Jim and Susie Shaughnessy of Ramona 
believe the partnership is a way to honor the memory of their daughter Colleen, 
who worked with the needy in Cleveland before she died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is carry on the idea that Colleen lived by, and help 
the people," Susie Shaughnessy said. "We want to use our attributes to do what 
we can to help in her name." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said being host of the program is a chance not only to remember the 
work of Colleen Shaughnessy, but also to promote the work of the center and 
inspire others to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow we can reach out in Colleen's name and make a difference in a child's 
life," Carroll said, adding that viewers "may not want to buy a home and (will) 
send a donation instead. It's a vehicle for me to inform people about the 
opportunities we provide." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents, in order to advertise homes on the show, agree to donate a 
minimum of $100 to the Colleen Shaughnessy Fund for the Homeless at the St. 
Vincent de Paul center, said Bill Pelley, chief executive officer of the MCA 
mortgage company. An agency also must refer $500,000 worth of home-buyer loans 
to MCA, and the company will contribute to the fund after paying its production 
costs, Pelley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation," he said. "Father Carroll wins, we win, the real 
estate agency wins and the home buyer 
</P>
<P>
wins. Everybody involved wins, and it's done through private enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
On the show, viewers see homes ranging in price from $300,000 to $2.5 million, 
in locations such as La Costa, San Marcos and Solana Beach. Between homes, 
Carroll takes the viewer on a brief tour of the facilities of the St. Vincent 
de Paul center, its school and medical facilities and its kitchen, which feeds 
2,000 people a day. 
</P>
<P>
Also included is a one-minute segment written by 12-year-old Dagney Tucker, the 
niece of Colleen Shaughnessy, who encourages young people to reach out to 
homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to try to help the young children across America," said Dagney, an 
aspiring actress, at the press conference. "I want to set up a pen pal thing so 
they can write to me and give ideas about what they can do to help homeless 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't need money, they need love, hope and friendship. They're not 
different, they're just down on their luck. I'm trying to get that across and 
help these children."

<TEXT>
<P>
Squirrels are known as savers, not spenders. So the chestnut-brown character 
that scurried about the offices of Los Angeles' City Council members for two 
days was obviously a dangerous symbol. And not so easy to catch. 
</P>
<P>
The animal was first sighted after it leaped through an open window into the 
quarters of Councilman Joel Wachs on Sunday. "One of our deputies locked it in 
our conference room," spokesman Greg Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Animal Regulation dispatched a small-game hunter, who left a 
non-lethal trap baited with sunflower seeds. The feed was still there Monday, 
and the animal was gone. "We figured it had gone back out the window," Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was observed in Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' office Tuesday. A new 
Animal Regulation man arrived and promptly set out a peanut butter trap. The 
intruder was trapped early Tuesday evening and hauled off by animal officers, 
who will release it in the wild later. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing," Nelson said, "is the second guy from Animal Reg told us, 'No 
wonder the first trap didn't work. They don't like sunflower seeds.' " 
</P>
<P>
Actor Leslie Nielsen has portrayed a hilarious nitwit in such recent movies as 
"Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun" (in the latter, making a fool of himself in a 
scene shot in Los Angeles' City Council chamber). 
</P>
<P>
Would you want a man associated with those roles backing you for a real-life 
seat in that chamber? 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Bernie Lohr-Schmidt would. On Tuesday, he announced the endorsement of 
Nielsen, a neighbor, in his run against incumbent Los Angeles City Councilman 
Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Lohr-Schmidt's spokesman Eric Shuman: "We're happy to have anything 
to get us a little bit of attention." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum aspired to be named Transportation 
Secretary in the Bush Administration, and his travel credentials certainly 
appeared in order. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, according to financial disclosure forms released Tuesday, listed 
$34,000 in gifts, including a $6,000 junket to Argentina and Chile that was 
paid for by South American investors. He also made trips to British Columbia, 
Costa Rica and the Mexican city of Cabo San Lucas in addition to several 
hunting expeditions, all paid for by investors and developers. 
</P>
<P>
His freebies -- the most showered on any supervisor -- actually amounted to 
about $40,000. Schabarum failed to declare a two-week European trade tour, 
sponsored by a private group. An aide said it was an "oversight." 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Schabarum and each of his colleagues listed among their gifts 
tickets to the Academy Awards ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
As a Los Angeles city councilwoman, she helped bring the Dodgers to Los Angeles 
nearly 31 years ago. And Rosalind Wyman will be in Dodger Stadium on April 13 
for the team's home opener. But it took an out-of-court settlement for her to 
get her tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Wyman sued her late husband's law firm last summer, claiming that she was being 
denied her partial rights to the firm's eight Dodger season tickets. A 
settlement was reached, appropriately enough, on opening day of this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The seats have been divided in a manner to satisfy everyone," said Alan Croll, 
who represented the law firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Rothman and Kuchel. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides refused to say how the seats will be divided. 
Investigative reporters have so far resisted the temptation to dig any further 
for the answer to that question. 
</P>
<P>
It was the wrong time and wrong place to cool off in the 100-degree weather 
Tuesday morning: 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was stalled on the eastbound Ventura Freeway when a broken sprinkler 
flooded three lanes with water.

Two inmates at the Las Colinas Men's Detention Facility in Santee escaped 
Monday night, but sheriff's deputies found them about an hour later less than 
200 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Clark and Donavan Chapman, both 19, escaped about 9:45 p.m. by throwing 
a mattress across the top of a 12-foot-high razor-wire fence and then climbing 
over, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Chapman then fled into a nearby dry river bed area, but a deputy 
spotted the two. The area was sealed off, and deputies with dogs closed in. The 
men were found hiding in the river bottom about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is in custody for possession of stolen property, possession of drugs and 
auto theft. Chapman is serving time for convictions related to burglary and 
several outstanding warrants for previous violations.

MY BEAT: SHOOTING IS FAR AWAY BUT HITS CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I never met Melinda Johnson, but I can't get her out of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
I sometimes think of her when I look at my own daughter. 
</P>
<P>
They were the same age and their communities are only about 10 miles apart, but 
they lived in two separate worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda lived in South-Central Los Angeles, and my daughter lives in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda has haunted me since last fall when I talked to her mother in a little 
apartment on South Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Physel Johnson is a preschool teacher. Her apartment is in one of those 
ordinary two-story complexes common to Southern California. The long narrow 
building is set perpendicular to the street. Stairs lead from Avalon Boulevard 
up to a walkway that runs along the second-floor apartments; another flight of 
stairs leads down to an alley in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
Physel Johnson's apartment is on the ground floor near the rear of the 
building. On an unseasonably warm night just over a year ago, she was sitting 
in her living room watching television while 15-year-old Melinda sat outside on 
the stairs talking to a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda was an outgoing girl. She liked music more than school. She was 
sometimes sassy, and she ate too much junk food. She was, after all, an 
American teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Melinda was sitting at the top of the backstairs. Her mother was 
always warning her not to sit in front near the street because of drive-by 
shootings on Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Physel Johnson was watching "Miami Vice" when she heard gunshots outside, a 
common sound in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually they didn't faze me," she said. "Because usually they sound like 
they're in the distance and my children are not outside. But that night they 
sounded like they were in my front door." 
</P>
<P>
Physel Johnson rushed outside. Melinda was lying at the top of the backstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw her laying there. . . . I guess I emotionally blacked out because I 
didn't see any blood." 
</P>
<P>
Melinda was dead. Her girlfriend was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In a Times story rounding up that weekend's violence in the inner city, Police 
Sgt. Ted Amstone called Melinda's death "just another useless killing in 
South-Central Los Angeles. They were just sitting there minding their own 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Months later when I talked to Physel Johnson, she was still trying to deal with 
her daughter's murder. She was taking it, she said, one day at a time. She 
didn't know if anyone had been arrested for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I have just put it in God's hands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is also in the hands of the police, but there have been no arrests and there 
are no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"She just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time," said Detective 
Bill Cox, whose caseload includes Melinda's murder. "They just drove down the 
alley and shot and killed her. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Cox works out of South Bureau homicide and is used to such shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been going at it a long time," he said, "and I've gone out many a time 
when innocent bystanders get shot." 
</P>
<P>
When Cox goes home to his own community, he doesn't think about the killing 
fields of South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
"If I took it home and thought about it," he said, "I'd probably go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Physel Johnson also tries not to think about the gunfire on the streets 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned to -- I hate to say tune it out -- but there are times I don't 
hear anything," she said. "My neighbor will say, 'Did you hear that?' and I 
didn't hear anything." 
</P>
<P>
In my home in Glendale, I occasionally watch "Miami Vice." But the pastel, 
stylized violence stays safely behind the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, crime in my community. But I don't hear gunfire on the 
streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
My own daughter has just turned 16. She is outgoing. She likes music more than 
school. Sometimes she is sassy, and she eats too much junk food. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"She just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time," Detective Cox 
said of Melinda. 
</P>
<P>
The wrong place was her own backstairs. 
</P>
<P>
There are times when I look at my daughter across the dinner table and wonder 
what it would be like to have to warn her not to sit outside the house because 
she might be shot. 
</P>
<P>
I can't get Melinda Johnson out of my mind.

A SIGNAL FOR SHAMIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The messages from Washington to Jerusalem are becoming blunter. First, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested that somewhere down the road 
Israel may have no choice but to negotiate directly with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. That possibility remains utterly unacceptable to Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, although a recent poll found that 62% of Israelis are 
reconciled to the chance of it happening within the next five years. Now, just 
days before his scheduled meeting with Shamir and with Egypt's visiting 
President Hosni Mubarak standing at his side, President Bush has called on 
Israel to end its "occupation" of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Bush carefully and properly avoided any hint of a timetable for Israel's 
withdrawal from the territories it took over with its victory in 1967's Six Day 
War or any reference to the conditions under which the "achievement of 
Palestinian political rights" should occur. The policy formula maintained by 
successive U.S. administrations is that occupied land should be exchanged for 
durable peace, and new and permanent boundaries must be negotiated to satisfy 
Israel's security concerns. That policy remains in force, and was underscored 
as Bush and Mubarak publicly accepted Israel's need for security safeguards 
while repudiating "any irredentist claims and vengeful acts" from the 
Palestinian side. The reference to irredentism was an unequivocal rejection of 
Palestinian claims of a "right" to return to former homes in Israel proper. 
</P>
<P>
It was to Shamir, though, to whom Bush's signal was most clearly directed. The 
prime minister has hinted that he will bring Bush some new ideas about giving 
the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories a larger say in their 
own governance, provided they first become more docile. But every indication is 
that the best Shamir will offer is a bundle of stale dogmas and failed 
expedients packaged in new wrapping. Shamir's greatest hope is to get 
Palestinians in the territories to elect leaders who will serve as political 
alternatives to the PLO. There is absolutely no reason to think that 
Palestinians will cooperate in such a plan, not least because Shamir and his 
Likud Party have made it clear that no matter what happens they will never 
negotiate an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. It is this inflexibility 
and lack of more creative thinking at the highest levels of Israel's government 
that is eliciting growing U.S. impatience with its friend and ally. 
</P>
<P>
That is by no means tantamount to an American endorsement of, or even 
necessarily greater sympathy for, the Palestinian political case. Even as 
frustration with Israel has grown in the United States, the theme that both 
sides must be ready to compromise, both sides must abandon their extremist 
goals, both sides must be prepared to negotiate directly has remained constant. 
The PLO and its supporters like to imply that Yasser Arafat's "recognition" of 
Israel in December was a concession of such magnitude that no further evidence 
of a change in PLO thinking is necessary. That, of course, is absurd. No less 
absurd is the hope of Shamir and those who think like him that somehow 
Palestinian nationalism as expressed in the intifada can be wished away, 
suppressed or stage-managed by Israeli-run local elections. What Washington is 
saying to both sides is that the time has come to recognize realities, respond 
seriously and embark at last on what promises to be a years-long struggle to 
make peace.

A CURE FOR THE BAY AREA BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider these issues now being faced by the sprawling, growing California 
metropolitan region: The economy is healthy, but its traditional base is 
eroding and changing in ways that are not well understood; there is concern 
about the quality of public education; housing and transportation problems are 
undercutting the area's competitiveness; growth and slow-growth forces are 
clashing, and the high quality of life is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
This litany should be familiar to Southern California officials who have 
expressed identical concerns but have found no effective, unified method of 
combatting the problems. This particular list of challenges, however, has been 
compiled by government, business and education leaders in the San Francisco Bay 
Area through a new entity known as the Bay Area Economic Forum. The forum is a 
public-private partnership formed late last year under the auspices of the Bay 
Area Council and the Assn. of Bay Area Governments. 
</P>
<P>
In a 24-page publication, the forum addresses itself to critical questions that 
are strikingly similar to problems in the Los Angeles region. The approach is 
much like that taken by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's LA 2000 committee, 
which urged a regional attack on regional problems. In its concluding section, 
the Bay Area report says: "Parochial thinking is one of the Bay Area's chief 
handicaps in dealing with the complex issues and difficult choices of the 
1990s. A shared and realistic vision of the region's problems, needs and 
potentials must become one of our chief goals." 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, members of the forum under the chairmanship of Robert T. Perry, 
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, represent the cream of 
leadership in the nine-county region, including the mayors of San Francisco, 
San Jose and Oakland; the president of Stanford University and the chancellors 
of UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, and top executives of industries including 
the Chevron Corp., National Semiconductor Corp. and Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
The forum is not just another discussion committee, Parry said in the forward 
to the booklet, but is a group designed to provide real leadership that crosses 
city lines and county boundaries. Considering traditional trans-bay rivalies, 
this will not be an easy task. But if the area's leaders insist on success, 
they will succeed. Southern California should watch with interest.

GUN CONTROL CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unfortunately, your editorial "But There Is an Answer" (March 22) is not at all 
the answer, but rather only a single element in a complex situation. These 
so-called assault rifles have been around for years and no one even discussed 
them. Heretofore, the politically popular target was handguns and specifically 
"Saturday-night specials;" this year it's trendy to be against semiautomatic 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Guns do not shoot by themselves, they require someone to operate them, and that 
can either be done lawfully or illegally, just like a car (with the same 
untoward results if either is operated illegally). The real problem is how do 
we disarm the drug gangs who engage in daily shootings? The mere carrying of 
any loaded firearm on a public street is already illegal, so restrictive (yet 
properly balanced with appropriate registration provisions) gun legislation, 
although perhaps helpful, is certainly not the answer itself. That's much too 
easy and simplistic a fix. 
</P>
<P>
The basic issue is plea bargaining and available jail space. We need more jail 
space, more courts operated on longer work schedules, more and better paid 
police, and legislation restricting the use of plea bargaining (goes 
hand-in-hand with jail construction), particularly in cases involving use of a 
firearm in a drug-related incident or on a public street or area. It would 
certainly help all of us if journalists, politicians, pro-gun groups, and 
anti-gun groups alike would now turn their considerable resources and attention 
toward resolving these much more pervasive, difficult and important questions 
wherein lies the real answer, as difficult, expensive, and painful as it may 
prove to be.

GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Am I the only one who has come to the realization that the modern "convenience" 
of spray paint has become more of a necessity to those who use it to deface 
private, city, state and federal property, in addition to the beauty of nature 
as you so sadly describe in your article "Nature Wears Stain of Graffiti" 
(Metro, March 27), than to the occasional buyer for legitimate purposes? 
</P>
<P>
In 10 short years Los Angeles has been overrun by these worthless vandals armed 
with cans of spray paint. Isn't it obvious that all the well-intentioned 
"graffiti clean-up projects" are useless? What takes hours to cleanup is 
destroyed in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need spray paint? I say we don't. And I'm willing to bet I'm not 
alone. The time has come to make spray paint one "convenience" we can live 
without. Now how do we go about getting a ban spray paint in California 
initiative on the ballot?

Please, please, please don't call these vandals "graffiti artists." This label

art, which evokes creativity, ability and beauty.

GUN CONTROL CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend you on the closing portion of your editorial on the assault weapons 
controversy. As you point out, the federal government has already had great 
success in limiting the magazine capacity of certain firearms used in hunting 
federally protected waterfowl. Since the only practical difference between the 
modern military-style self-loader and its commercial cousin is magazine 
capacity, and since both the locally enacted and state proposed laws define 
"assault weapons" by magazine capacity, it would seem both reasonable and 
practical simply to ban either general ownership or possession in public of 
magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of center-fire rifle 
cartridges. Enactment at the state level would encourage parallel federal 
legislation, as well as providing an effective tool for local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Such a law would, I believe, be a compromise acceptable to all but the most 
extreme on both sides of the argument. To have a significant long-term impact 
upon criminal misuse of firearms, however, such a law, and any law in this 
area, must be supported by legislation banning firearms ownership by such 
classes as those convicted of violent misdemeanors, those under a restraining 
order based upon findings of potential harm or harassment, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the forthcoming change in California drivers' licenses, making 
them much harder to forge and encoding more information on them, offers this 
state an opportunity to join the U.S. Department of Justice in its 
congressionally mandated assignment of developing a method of verifying the 
identity and qualification of firearms purchasers at the point of sale.

ENERGY SECURITY MUCH IMPROVED, BUT NEVER CHALLENGE-PROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL YERGIN, Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates, is the author of Prize of the Venture: Oil, Money, and Politics, to 
be published later this year by Simon and Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past nine months, a series of accidents and mishaps have disrupted oil 
production and transportation in the North Sea and now in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that these areas are two of the most important pillars on which 
the industrial world rebuilt its energy security after the oil shocks of the 
1970s. Alaskan oil development, which only received its go-ahead in the midst 
of the 1973 embargo, has proved to be central to America's position, accounting 
today for a quarter of total U.S. oil production. The Alaskan spill has 
occurred at a time when energy security itself has been coming to the fore 
again. The volatility of oil prices has added to the uneasiness; in a matter of 
six months, the price of oil has gone up almost 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by many measures, we have seen a considerable improvement in U.S. energy 
security. America is considerably more energy efficient than it was in 1973, 
when the first oil shock hit. Oil is now produced and exported from many more 
countries than was the case in the early 1970s, and energy users have greater 
flexibility to switch among fuels. The automobile fuel efficiency standards and 
Alaskan oil production have each proved to be worth about two million barrels 
per day to the United States -- one in terms of reduced demand and the other in 
terms of increased output. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, various important measures for energy security are now in place -- 
including the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, which contains the equivalent of 86 days of oil imports. When the 
sensible idea of such a reserve was first raised by President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower in the aftermath of the 1956 Suez Crisis (which also saw an oil 
disruption), his Cabinet dismissed the idea as ridiculous. Now, it is seen as a 
wise insurance policy -- and one that might have saved everyone a lot of 
hardship at the end of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there is a sizable security margin. Oil and energy are not the 
constraints on economic growth that they were in the 1970s and early '80s. In 
fact, the oil price collapses of 1986 and 1988 have been like giant "tax cuts" 
for consumers, contributing to the unexpectedly strong economic growth of the 
past few years while helping to keep down inflation. While people still grope 
for the new meaning of "power" in international relations, it is no longer in 
terms of confrontation between consuming and producing countries, between North 
and South, but now in terms of the relationship between the United States, 
Japan and the other industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
Yet recent trends are spurring renewed concerns. America is a high-cost oil 
producer; in the new market that has come with the oil-price collapse, the 
United States does not easily compete. U.S. oil production has fallen by more 
than 10% since 1985. Meanwhile, demand has risen by 14%. The effect can be seen 
in oil imports. They had risen to 46% of total consumption in 1979, when the 
Shah of Iran's fall from power triggered the second shock. Imports declined to 
just 27% of consumption in 1985, but now are around 40% and are generally 
expected to exceed 50% sometime in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the severity of the price collapse, the sharp decline in 
energy investment and the tighter balance between supply and demand will set 
the stage for a new crisis. Whether that actually happens depends on a variety 
of factors. Will conservation lose its momentum in the advanced countries? Will 
economic growth recover in the developing world, setting off explosive growth 
in demand for oil? Will non-OPEC production continue at present levels, or 
decline? In answering that last question, future exploration in Alaska will be 
one of the most important factors, since it is widely considered to be one of 
the last best hopes for finding major new oil resources in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But one further question will also affect the outlook -- the new environmental 
agenda. The environment is becoming as important as security in evaluating 
energy choices. While eyes are currently fastened on the Alaskan oil spill, the 
real focus is on clean air and the atmosphere. The result could be a major 
shift toward natural gas as a clean fuel, a new emphasis on research and 
investment in new technologies, and a new rationale in the 1990s for 
conservation. Whether that will work with or against security remains to be 
seen. The environment is, like defense or medical care or education, a "good," 
which means that someone has to pay for it. We can certainly look forward to 
major political battles as to how the bill will be divided up. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic shifts in oil prices over the past few months underscore the 
volatility in the energy scene and how rapidly circumstances can change. Both 
current realities and four decades of experience (though surprisingly 
little-recognized) tell us that it would be remarkable if we get to the end of 
the 1990s without our energy security being challenged in one way or another -- 
whether by politics, pressures in the balance between supply and demand or by 
various combinations of "accidents" and surprises. Such challenges do not, 
however, necessarily mean a new crisis. That will depend on conditions in the 
marketplace, economic and political institutions, the values and priorities and 
objectives of consumers and producers -- and on the memory of hard-learned 
lessons.

ROAD-TAX PROPONENTS CIRCULATE PETITIONS IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita Valley business leaders have begun circulating petitions seeking 
public support for a proposed bond measure that would add from $75 to $200 to 
property-tax bills to build and improve valley roads. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Garasi, president of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce, said 
Tuesday that proponents hope the petitions will persuade the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to join the Santa Clarita City Council in placing the 
measure on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi said the Canyon Country and Santa Clarita Valley chambers of commerce 
launched the petition drive in unincorporated sections of the valley at the 
request of Supervisor Mike Antonovich. Although Antonovich has shown interest 
in the bond proposal, Garasi said, he has not said he will support placing it 
before voters. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council last week approved an agreement drafted by city 
and county staffs to create a joint-powers authority to administer taxes 
collected to pay off the 25-year bonds. The agreement must be approved by the 
supervisors because the tax would be levied on property in unincorporated areas 
of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost about $110,000 in administrative and legal fees to prepare the 
bond measure for the November election. If the measure passes, the bonds will 
pay off those fees. If the measure loses, Santa Clarita and the county will 
have to split the costs. 
</P>
<P>
The chambers did not have time to launch a house-by-house petition drive. 
Instead they have mailed 2,000 petitions to registered voters in neighborhoods 
suffering from chronic traffic congestion, said Connie Worden, a city planning 
commissioner and bond measure proponent. 
</P>
<P>
Each petition has room for just four signatures. Worden said organizers hope 
that residents will sign the petition and perhaps gather signatures from a few 
neighbors and mail them to the Santa Clarita Valley Transportation Committee, 
an offshoot of the two chambers of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi and Worden said they are hoping for at least 200 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi and Worden admitted that collecting signatures through the mail is 
unorthodox and politically risky because it asks residents to not only sign but 
mail their petitions. If the response is poor, supervisors may decide the issue 
would not pass in November. 
</P>
<P>
It would be much easier to gather signatures in public places, such as shopping 
centers, but time is short and the petition drive must target registered voters 
in the unincorporated valley, Garasi said. There are no major shopping centers 
outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi predicted that growing frustration over traffic will encourage people to 
mail in their petitions. "If they are upset with traffic congestion, they'll be 
willing to spend 25 cents," he said.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN SANITY PHASE OF DENTIST'S TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mistrial has been declared in the sanity phase of the murder trial of a 
dentist after jurors said they were unable to decide whether he was sane at the 
time of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court jury sent out a note Monday to Judge Donald 
Meloche, saying they were deadlocked after 15 hours of deliberations on the 
sanity of Dr. Douglas Dustin, 53. 
</P>
<P>
Dustin, who lives in the Los Angeles area, was convicted March 17 by the same 
jury of first-degree murder in the Sept. 13, 1987, shooting death of Dustin's 
estranged wife, Adelheid (Heide) Dustin, 50, near her La Jolla home. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors said six of them voted one way, five another, and one was undecided 
on the sanity question. 
</P>
<P>
Dustin's murder conviction will stand, but he will be retried on the sanity 
phase. Meloche ordered Dustin back to court on April 21 for setting a retrial 
date. 
</P>
<P>
If he is found insane, he would likely be committed to a mental hospital, 
possibly for life. But if jurors find he was sane, he would face a state prison 
term of 26 years-to-life. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the psychiatrists who examined him testified during the sanity phase 
that they believe he was insane at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
John Mitchell, Dustin's attorney, said in court he may ask that he get a new 
trial on the guilt phase of the trial because the jurors failed to reach a 
verdict on sanity. 
</P>
<P>
The sanity phase began March 20 and the jury began their deliberations on 
Thursday afternoon.

DOCTOR FINED FOR DISPENSING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego doctor who distributed drugs without a legitimate medical purpose 
has been fined $20,000 and placed on five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Julius Gorton, 58, who had an office on 40th Street, was given a suspended 
three-year sentence Monday but no actual jail time was imposed and his medical 
license was not suspended. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Rudi Brewster ordered Gorton not to prescribe 
controlled substances in the future under conditions of probation. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton pleaded guilty Dec. 12 to one count of illegally distributing a 
controlled drug to an undercover agent who posed as a patient. 
</P>
<P>
He was indicted by a federal grand jury on April 28, 1988, on 60 counts of 
distributing drugs without a legitimate medical purpose. Fifty-nine charges 
were dismissed when he pleaded guilty to one count. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference announcing the indictment, then-U.S. Atty. Peter Nunez 
said the drugs illegally distributed included Valium, Tylenol with codeine, 
sleeping pills, diet pills and cough syrup.

DRUNK CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
DRIVER JAILED DAY BEFORE FATAL ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Ventura County woman accused in a drunk driving accident that killed three 
young men and injured two others last week had been arrested the day before on 
a drunk driving charge in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Helen Mannes, 34, of Somis, was arrested at 2:02 a.m. Thursday after 
being stopped by a California Highway Patrol officer near Tampa Avenue and the 
Ventura Freeway, said police spokesman Don Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
She was held at Van Nuys jail for eight hours and released on her own 
recognizance, Lawrence said. The charges are pending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was again arrested Friday night after an accident on the northbound 
Ventura Freeway that killed three young men and injured two others as the young 
people were walking on the highway's shoulder to seek help for a flat tire. 
They had parked their car and were walking away from it when Mannes' car 
sideswiped theirs and flipped over, striking the young men, said officer Jim 
Utter of the Ventura County CHP. 
</P>
<P>
The car with the flat tire was not obstructing traffic lanes, Utter said. A 
half-empty bottle of vodka was found in Mannes' car after the accident, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for two of the dead youths -- 14-year-old Jacob Eugene Boyd 
and 19-year-old Joshua Daniel Oxenreider, both of Camarillo -- were held 
Tuesday in Camarillo. The body of the third victim -- 20-year old Darin Scott 
Mullins -- was sent to his home in Mansfield, Ohio, on Monday, said Craig 
Stevens, deputy coroner at the office of the Ventura County Medical Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Boyd's brother, Jeremy Boyd, 19, and Jeff Botens, 16, both of Camarillo, 
were in stable condition and improving Tuesday at Pleasant Valley Hospital in 
Camarillo, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth man, 21-year-old Anthony Dunn of Thousand Oaks, said Tuesday he escaped 
injury by climbing over a freeway guard rail and separating himself from 
traffic. Dunn said the others were about 25 feet from their car when they were 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said his friends had gone to Thousand Oaks to pick him up and were 
returning to Camarillo when the accident occurred. They planned to repair 
several dirt bikes at Oxenreider's home and go riding the next day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was released Monday from Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand 
Oaks after being treated for minor injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. Utter 
said Mannes may have been transferred to Simi Adventist Hospital in Simi 
Valley. But Simi Adventist nursing supervisor Gloria Kutches said Tuesday that 
nobody by that name had been admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities released Mannes to Los Robles Regional Hospital after she was given 
a blood alcohol test Friday night, Utter said. The CHP has not concluded its 
investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the blood test could take two weeks to complete, he said.

LAKERS TROUNCE SEATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
GREEN SCORES 33 AS L.A. COLLECTS WIN NO. 50, 115-97

<TEXT>
<P>
Between diagramming plays here Tuesday night in his new capacity as a Golden 
State Warriors scout, former Portland Trail Blazer Coach Mike Schuler pointed 
to Laker forward A.C. Green and shook his head seemingly in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gotten so much better, just this season, that it's really scary," Schuler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was savagely pulling down rebounds, systematically swishing outside 
shots, blocking shots like a volleyball spiker or scuffling with Xavier 
McDaniel, Green was a dominating force in the Lakers' surprisingly dominating 
115-97 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics before 14,819 at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite a one-man show, but the Lakers' most vital component on this night, 
Green scored a career-high 33 points, making 11 of 14 shots, grabbed 10 
rebounds and blocked three shots and did not back down during a shoving match 
with the notoriously hot-headed McDaniel in a third-quarter altercation. 
</P>
<P>
Green's performance, coupled with an 18-assist night from Magic Johnson and 
help off the bench from previously untapped sources such as Mark McNamara and 
Tony Campbell, enabled the Lakers to win for the first time in three meeting 
with the SuperSonics in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave the Lakers their 10th straight 50-win season and, with 10 
regular-season games remaining, kept alive their slim hopes of finishing with 
the league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley could not remember the last time his team played this 
well on the road, which has been fraught with obstacles for the Lakers all 
season. They made 55.7% of their shots, resurrecting their fast break by 
holding a 53-35 rebounding advantage. And, defensively, the Lakers forced the 
SuperSonics to shoot just 41%. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total effort tonight," Riley said. "Our defense was exceptional. It 
had to be one of our better road games in quite some time." 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, it also was one of Green's better games in some time. 
Perhaps the most consistent Laker, in terms of effort and rebounding, Green 
showcased all facets of his game Tuesday night, perhaps surprising the 
SuperSonics as well as courtside observers such as Schuler. 
</P>
<P>
"A.C. scored 33 tonight?" Riley asked. "We don't even run any plays for him. 
From a percentage standpoint, A.C. is right behind Byron Scott from long-range 
shooting. Most teams still don't believe he can shoot out there, and they 
sacrifice him to double-team other guys." 
</P>
<P>
Five of Green's 11 baskets Tuesday night came from the perimeter, but he still 
does his best work underneath. Green had four of is six offensive rebounds in 
the second half, and his aggressive defensive play kept the SuperSonics from 
scoring inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is the kind of team that makes you play hard," Green said. "They 
challenge you, and I like challenges. They are either going to run over you, or 
make you play well. One or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Green certainly did not allow himself to be run over. His clash with McDaniel 
almost started the second Laker fight in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was restrained after shoving Milwaukee's Larry 
Krystkowiak Sunday night, Green and McDaniel had to be pulled apart (by Riley, 
of all people) after an exchange of shoves late in the third quarter of 
Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
The incident happened with 1:36 to play in the third quarter. Seattle's Sedale 
Threatt had found a gap in the Laker defense and was heading uncontested to the 
basket for a layup. Then Green emerged to deny the basket with a hard foul. 
</P>
<P>
Green stood over Threatt for a moment, apparently trying to step over him, when 
McDaniel intervened. The two proceeded to scuffle, trying to disengage 
themselves from peacemakers to begin again. They were near midcourt when Riley 
risked his designer cut suit and went between the players, arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know what happened," said Green, hesitant to talk about the 
incident. He thought one thing; I thought another." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he intervened because he did not want to lose Green, at a crucial 
juncture of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"A.C. is a warrior, and so is X (McDaniel)," Riley said. "The altercation got 
heated, and neither team needs to get somebody suspended, especially at this 
time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
With 10 games left in the regular season, the Lakers are trying to get their 
act together heading for the playoffs. Before Tuesday night, the Lakers had 
been 0-7 against their three main Western Conference rivals -- Utah, Phoenix 
and Seattle -- something that was mentioned before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into Utah and Phoenix this season and not winning, we felt we had to 
break through," Riley said. "To show ourselves, not anyone else, that we can 
win on the road." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers took control almost from the outset, holding a 54-51 halftime lead. 
A 15-3 run early in the third quarter gave the Lakers a 14-point lead, which 
was cushion enough to withstand a brief fourth-quarter challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The closest the SuperSonics could come to catching the Lakers was 87-80 with 
9:43 to play. Even when Riley gave Green and Johnson a two-minute rest shortly 
thereafter, the Lakers maintained an 11-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson and Green returned for the final 6:21, the Lakers went on a 10-4 
surge that clinched it. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who said the Lakers are basically just fine tuning for the playoffs, 
apparently came upon a substitution pattern that works. Forward Orlando 
Woolridge was benched Tuesday night, in favor of McNamara, whose forte is 
rebounding and defense. And Campbell also took some of Woolridge's minutes to 
help jump-start the Laker fastbreak. 
</P>
<P>
For one night, at least, that combination was productive. McNamara had 10 
points and six rebounds in 21 minutes, and Campbell had eight points in 13 
minutes.

CHARGERS ARE SEEING DOUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBITION SCHEDULE HAS THEM PLAYING TWICE IN THREE DAYS

<P>
The Chargers will take a whirlwind tour of California in August, playing two 
exhibition games on the road in three days because of scheduling conflicts, it 
was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are scheduled to play the Rams in Anaheim on Monday, Aug. 21, at 8 
p.m., then travel to Candlestick Park for a game against the Super Bowl 
champion San Francisco 49ers on Wednesday, Aug. 23 at 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will open the exhibition schedule with a nationally televised game 
against the Dallas Cowboys Sunday, Aug. 13, at noon. The Padres, who originally 
left Aug. 12 open for a possible football exhibition game, will move their 
scheduled Aug. 13 game against the Atlanta Braves to the 12th at 7:05. 
</P>
<P>
(Padre ticket-holders for the 13th have three options: Aug. 13 tickets will be 
honored Aug. 12th on a same-seat basis; Aug. 13 tickets may be exchanged before 
Aug. 12 for a game of choice, excluding concert dates, or full face value of 
the tickets will be refunded.) 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were forced into the unusual near-doubleheader because the Rams 
and 49ers did not get the same kind of cooperation from the Angels and Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scheduled (by the National Football League) in weekend two to be in 
Anaheim and weekend three in San Francisco, but both came up unavailable," said 
Jack Teele, the Chargers' director of administration. "So we had to take the 
dates that were available." 
</P>
<P>
Teele said that Aug. 17 was open at Anaheim but that the Angels wouldn't 
approve the date, exercising a 36-hour clause that prohibits any event from 
taking place at Anaheim Stadium 36 hours before a scheduled Angel game. He said 
there was a similar hangup between the Giants and 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"In a spirit of cooperation, the Chargers and Padres have played within 12 
hours (of each other)," Teele said. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning was on a scouting trip and could not be reached for 
comment. Rick Smith, the Chargers' public relations director, said the team 
would normally have 60-65 players available for each game at that time of the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will conclude the exhibition schedule against the Phoenix 
Cardinals Sept. 1 at 7 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. It will be the 
first time since 1980 that the Chargers have had fewer than three exhibition 
games at home.

HURST GETS BAD START FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
HE GIVES UP EIGHT RUNS AS THE GIANTS WIN AGAIN

Look at it this way. 
</P>
<P>
If Tony Gwynn didn't hurl his body against the center-field wall to make a 
catch . . . if John Kruk didn't leap across the warning track to make a catch . 
. . if Roberto Alomar didn't swan dive into a line drive for a catch . . . if 
Tim Flannery didn't dig holes at third base to make three catches . . . the 
Padres would have lost, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, their second consecutive fall to the San Francisco Giants Monday was 
at least by something resembling a baseball score -- 8-3 -- even if Bruce Hurst 
did feel as if he had been passed, punted and kicked. 
</P>
<P>
In front a paid crowd of 21,768 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, making his 
National League and Padre debut, Hurst learned at least one thing. When you 
walk outside without your best stuff, they treat you here just as they would in 
Boston or Bangkok. They murder you. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's biggest free agent winner this winter ($5.25 million for three 
years) was a victim of a different sort of collusion as the Giants joined 
together to put him through five innings that stretched into the darkest parts 
of his imagination. One of baseball's premier left-handers was racked for 10 
hits and eight runs, including two homers (back to back) and three doubles, and 
he even threw a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Just four batters into his Padre career, he had allowed a run. Two innings 
later, he allowed six, facing 10 hitters in a stretch that included a three-run 
homer by Will Clark and another homer -- one pitch later -- by Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
After that inning, also for the first time as a Padre, the calm Hurst flung his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I was awful," said Hurst afterward, professionally facing and answering all 
questions. "I think my target area was dugout to dugout." 
</P>
<P>
He said his shoulder, which had suffered from some stiffness during the spring 
but didn't bother him as he went 4-1 with a 2.70 ERA, felt fine and loose in 
the 80-degree heat. He said it was his mind that was hurting. Being the new kid 
on the block, Hurst said, has taken his concentration around the block. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great, I had a nice sweat going . . . but I just wasn't prepared to 
pitch," Hurst said. "There's been a lot of distractions going on around here 
lately, there's been a lot of things happening . . . trying to get settled 
here, trying to do this or that, maybe do too much . . . but I'm not going to 
make excuses. That's my pet peeve -- they don't ask too much, just that you be 
ready to pitch. I should have been ready. I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' right-handed middle relievers were ready, as Greg Booker and Mark 
Grant combined for four shutout innings, including five strikeouts in the final 
two innings by Grant. The middle relievers have now thrown 6 1/3 scoreless 
innings in two games, giving much pleasure to McKeon, who has felt they have 
taken undue criticism. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the only thing that would make McKeon happier is a victory for 
his 0-2 club. Especially since the Padres may tend to take early season losing 
a little worse than other teams. After all, they have lost their first five 
games in each of the past two seasons en route to baseball's worst starts each 
of those years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be OK, we're not going to panic," McKeon said. "I said in 
spring training that some of these guys were actually pitching too good, and 
that I knew they had to have a bad outing, and hoped they would have it then. 
It's all part of the game. We'll be here tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else Tuesday, as they struggled against the smart pitching of 
starter and winner Kelly Downs (seven shutout innings), the Padres proved their 
defense is with them. If only they hadn't needed such defense. 
</P>
<P>
Example: With one out in the first, Robby Thompson lined a single to left. Will 
Clark doubled into the right-field gap, moving Thompson to third. Mitchell 
bounced a single past shortstop, scoring one run and moving Clark to third. 
</P>
<P>
Then Candy Maldonado simply crushed a ball to center field . . . but Gwynn 
chased it down and made a leaping, bouncing-off-the-wall catch. Observers 
ranked it among Gwynn's top three career catches -- and he has had four in 
which he's gone over the wall. That catch was followed by a diving stop by 
Flannery at third base off a Matt Williams grounder to save another run. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the catch was that good," Gwynn said. "It was like, I couldn't 
tell where the wall was. Then I just caught it and karate-kicked the wall, and 
that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant Manager Roger Craig: "Those guys playing defense never quit." 
</P>
<P>
Flannery made another diving stop the next inning, but by the third, it didn't 
matter. Quickly now -- Brett Butler doubled. Thompson walked. Clark homered off 
of what turned out to be a pitch that typified Hurst's night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fastball," Clark stated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a forkball," Hurst said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell then hit his second homer in two games, to right. Maldonado 
singled. Kruk made a great leaping catch off Matt Williams' hit to right. Kirt 
Manwaring reached first on a throwing error by Flannery. Jose Uribe singled in 
a run. Manwaring scored on a passed ball by Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he felt awful for Hurst, Gwynn said, "I felt awful for everybody. 
You could just see that Hurst wasn't getting the ball where he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to today, 1:05 p.m., the Padres' Ed Whitson against the Giants' 
Don Robinson. Whitson is one of the Padres' best pitchers at stopping losing 
streaks, and while two games is not considered a losing streak, the Padres only 
lost more than three games in a row once last year under McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who ended last night's game in a rare pinch-hit performance because 
McKeon had run out of players, said he's ready to for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been good at this (winning games after losses) in the past, and 
hopefully, I'll be good at it again," Whitson said. "The Giants are hitting as 
good as I've ever seen them hit as a team. But I'll be out there. You can count 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rhoda Polley, the Padre administrative assistant who threw out the first ball 
Monday, resigned Tuesday to concentrate on her fight with cancer. . . . 
Monday's loss means the Padres won't equal one of baseball's most unusual 
records of last year, when they were the only team to win the first game of 
every home stand, going 9-0. They are still 17-2 in the past 19 home-stand 
openers. . . . Outfielder Shane Mack, on the 15-day disabled list with a sore 
elbow, is still unable to throw the ball any harder than a light toss. He won't 
be ready for a couple of weeks, at which point he will be shipped to triple-A 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Salazar was not surprised at the giant reception he received in Monday 
night's opener, including chants of "Louieeeee." "Hey," Salazar said, "I've 
been here before, you know? These people remember." This is his third stop 
here. . . . No wonder the Giants have won eight of their past 11 games here, 
including their last six. They are loaded with San Diego connections. No fewer 
than eight Giants either live here or used to play here, according to research 
by the Giants' publicity staff. Manager Roger Craig, coach Norm Sherry, and 
players Kevin Mitchell, Terry Kennedy, Craig Lefferts and Joe Price all live in 
the area. Coach Bill Fahey and pitcher Dave Dravecky used to play here. 
</P>
<P>
Giant fans will be heartened by the news that disabled pitcher Mike Krukow 
looked good in a simulated game Tuesday afternoon and could come off the 
disabled list within a couple of weeks. The return of Krukow, 7-4 with a 3.54 
ERA last season before undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery Sept. 13, will 
send either Don Robinson, Scott Garrelts or Atlee Hammaker to the bullpen. . . 
. In the Miracle Cure Dept., Giant third baseman Mitchell says he has been 
hitting so well this spring -- a major-league leading .455 during the spring 
and then two homers in the first two regular season games this week -- because 
of simple thing: contact lenses. Mitchell said he has not been truly seeing the 
ball since he was hit in the face with a pitch by Jay Tibbs, then a Cincinnati 
pitcher, in 1986. He decided this winter to get the lenses, and the results 
have spoken loudly for themselves. . . . Padre Fever Dept: On Monday, a local 
radio station auctioned 22 bats signed by the 1984 Padres. They were sold, for 
charity, for $4,600.

FISH REPORT: BASS, TROUT ARE ACTIVE AT PYRAMID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Striped bass fishing at Pyramid Lake has been picking up in recent weeks and 
fishermen lucky enough to be at that northern Los Angeles County reservoir when 
trout are being stocked are hitting the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Carpenter of Lebec caught and released seven stripers weighing 46 1/2 
pounds; Paul Selkirk of Simi Valley caught and released nine totaling 68 
pounds, the largest an 18-pounder, and Ron Morgan of Granada Hills caught four 
stripers, including a 23-pounder.

<P>
AGREEMENT REACHED TO RESTORE WILDLIFE HABITAT IN LOWER OWENS VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalists and sportsmen are hailing a tentative agreement between the 
Los Angeles City Department of Water and Power and the Inyo County Water Dept. 
to implement the Lower Owens Valley Project. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 arid acres stretching about 50 miles from Independence south to 
Lone Pine will be restored as a warm-water fishery for bass and a wetlands 
habitat for wildlife, including tule elk, waterfowl and other birds. 
</P>
<P>
And Los Angeles, supporters say, won't miss a drop. 
</P>
<P>
The water will be removed from the L.A. aqueduct through the existing Blackrock 
spill gates north of Independence, increasing the flow into the Lower Owens 
River from a maximum of 25 cubic feet per second to as much as 50 c.f.s. 
</P>
<P>
Thaddeus Taylor, an Inyo County water commissioner and county manager for 
CalTrout, said the current flow is often nearer 5 to 10 c.f.s. but probably 
will stabilize at about 35 once the project is in place. Before it reaches dry 
Owens Lake, the water will be recovered through a pump-back station at Keeler 
Bridge on California 136 southeast of Lone Pine and returned to the aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
The hang-up was the pump-back station. Estimates a year ago were that it would 
cost $4- to $6-million to build and $100,000 to $200,000 a year to operate. 
Inyo County, which says it has no money, wanted L.A. to build it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project is now budgeted at $7.5 million for construction and 
$900,000 a year to run, the city has agreed to split the building cost and 
finance Inyo County's half at $300,000 a year, interest free. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced last Friday at Bishop beat by one day a court-imposed 
deadline of April 1 to reach a preliminary agreement on a long-term management 
plan for ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that the agreement was significant because, since 1905 when Owens 
River water started flowing to Los Angeles, "It's the first time they have 
entertained the notion of co-management of water resources in the Owens 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department of Fish and Game will be the lead agency in developing the 
plan. Overseers based in Bishop are Curtis Milliron, a fisheries biologist, and 
Denyse Racine, a wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Tillemans of the DWP office in Bishop drew the original draft plan, and 
Taylor and David Groeneveld, a plant ecologist for the Inyo County Water Dept., 
also played leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that construction of the pump-back station is scheduled to start in 
July of 1990, after completion of an environmental impact report, and 
construction will take three years. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said fishing and waterfowl interests are being solicited for input. 
</P>
<P>
The country's largest gathering of fly fishermen and stars of the sport is 
scheduled Saturday and Sunday at the Amfac Hotel in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 3,000 are expected to attend "Flyfishing World," the annual production of 
the Southwest Council Federation of Fly Fishers, which represents 25 clubs in 
Southern California, southern Arizona and southern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which started in 1973 at Wilderness Park in Downey with about 300 
people, will feature exhibitors from Alaska, Canada and the East Coast, and 
there will be continuous demonstrations and presentations by widely known 
personalities, including fly tiers Polly Rosborough and Poul Jorgensen and 
anglers Dave and Joan Whitlock, Mike Lawson, Dick Talleur and Rick Pasquale. 
</P>
<P>
Registration opens at 7:30 a.m. Presentations are scheduled from 9:30 to 3:30 
each day. A banquet is scheduled at 7:30 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $12 for adults, $15 for families. Proceeds will go to local 
conservation projects. Parking is free. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game reports that there were 23 hunting casualties 
in the state in 1988, including one fatality. Shotguns accounted for 13 of the 
accidents, archery two. Sixteen occurred during the pursuit of waterfowl and 
upland game. The fatality was one of seven shootings of deer hunters. The 
trigger of the hunter's own rifle snagged as he was climbing through a fence. . 
. . State fishery biologists are cautiously confident that they have developed 
a larger hybrid strain of bass in Shasta Lake since introducing Florida 
largemouths into the northern largemouth habitat in 1980. Old-timers at the 
lake marveled at the size of the bass -- up to 8 1/2 pounds, several over 7 1/2 
-- taken recently. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 openings remain for reservations to climb the Mt. Whitney Trail to 
the highest peak -- 14,495 feet -- in the 48 contiguous states this year. The 
Whitney Ranger District in Lone Pine limits traffic to 50 hikers a day, by 
reservation only. There were 7,350 last year. This year, July, August and 
weekends in June and September are filled. Those applying now are advised to 
ask for mid-week dates in September and October. Write: Whitney Ranger 
District, P.O. Box 8, Lone Pine, Calif., 93545. A response takes four to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Rosala of Buena Park won last weekend's Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby 
with a tournament-record 47-pound 1-ounce fish. Jim Goodwin, West Los Angeles, 
was second with a fish at 29-8, and Michael Resideskg, Costa Mesa, third, 20-5. 
There were 1,800 participants, who weighed-in 415 legal catches of 22 inches or 
longer. . . . Marriott's Fly Fishing Center in Fullerton is offering classes in 
nine facets of the sport this month. For details, call 1 (800) 367-2299. . . . 
The Santa Monica Bay chapter of Ducks Unlimited will have its 10th annual 
banquet Wednesday, April 19, at 7:15 p.m., at the Bel Air Club, 16801 Pacific 
Coast Highway, Pacific Palisades. For details: (213) 829-4336.

GRAF, NAVRATILOVA STRUGGLE EARLY BEFORE WINNING

<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf and No. 2 Martina Navratilova both struggled in the 
early going before winning Tuesday in the second round of the $300,000 Family 
Circle Magazine Cup tennis tournament at Sea Pines Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the top-ranked women's player in the world, defeated Rosalyn Fairbank of 
South Africa, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova was extended to three sets before defeating Laura Gildemeister of 
Peru, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Zina Garrison withdrew from the competition Tuesday. She suffered a groin 
injury against Chris Evert during the Lipton International Players 
Championships last week. 
</P>
<P>
The only seeded player to lose was No. 12 Raffaella Reggi of Italy, who fell to 
Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's match against Fairbank lasted 76 minutes on a hot day at stadium court. 
The West German fell behind, 4-3, in the first set before taking three straight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, 19, double-faulted to end the sixth game of the second set and allow 
Fairbank to draw even at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
But Graf then rattled off three straight to take the set and the match. 
</P>
<P>
"The first match is a little tougher than usual and you're not as patient," 
said Graf, who had a bye in the first round on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosalyn was playing really well. She kept the ball in play and I really didn't 
have the rhythm."

NEWBURY PARK BRACES TO FACE SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newbury Park enters today's Marmonte League baseball game against first-place 
Simi Valley with an 11-1-3 record, an 11-game unbeaten streak (9-0-2), and the 
distinction as one of the area's surprise teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've opened a few eyes," Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said, 
"including mine. The kids believe in themselves, though." 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers, who are 2-0 in league play, can make believers of others if they 
knock off Simi Valley, which has won 10 in a row, including three league games. 
Newbury Park almost upset the Pioneers last season when it took a 5-0 lead into 
the seventh inning. But Simi Valley rallied for six runs to win, a key step in 
the Pioneers' drive to their third consecutive league title under Coach Mike 
Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were up, 5-0, and never did get an out," Fabricius said. "I'm wondering if 
Scyphers is going to want those three outs back." 
</P>
<P>
Eight men out: Perhaps for Cleveland, eight is enough. 
</P>
<P>
In a North Valley League game at Kennedy last week, the Cavaliers were forced 
to finish the game with eight players after senior Mario Valencia was ejected 
in the top of the sixth for arguing through the backstop screen with the 
home-plate umpire. 
</P>
<P>
"He got into a verbal disagreement with the ump," Cleveland assistant Marty 
Siegel said. "And by then, we'd already used everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
With the Cavaliers' 15-man roster exhausted, Siegel elected to play with two 
outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy won the game, 11-1, but failed to score in the sixth. With nine 
Cleveland players on the field, Kennedy scored in every inning but the third. 
</P>
<P>
Packing a punch: Notre Dame committed six errors in losing its first game of 
the season to St. John Bosco in the St. Paul tournament last week, but Coach 
Bob Mandeville could not fault the Knights' offense. 
</P>
<P>
With seniors Chris Lohman and Steve Martinez and junior Kevin Milligan leading 
the way, Notre Dame (12-1) scored 53 runs in five games last week. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to St. John Bosco, 11-7, the Knights defeated Murphy (12-0), 
Loyola (13-2), Alemany (6-3) and Hawthorne (15-13). 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Lohman was 11 for 20 with a double, triple, three home runs and 
nine runs batted in during the tournament. First baseman Milligan was eight for 
13 with a home run and eight RBIs. Second baseman Martinez was nine for 15 with 
a double, triple and home run. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hitting the ball exceptionally well right now," Mandeville said. "I 
think the fact that we've got five seniors in the starting lineup has a lot to 
do with that. We've got some kids who expect to hit well and that feeling has 
rubbed off on the younger players." 
</P>
<P>
With Lohman (.500), Milligan (.486), Martinez (.405) and catcher Bobby Hughes 
(.455) all hitting better than .400, Notre Dame was batting .365 as a team and 
scored 119 runs through 12 games.

<P>
Add Notre Dame: Hughes began the season as one of the area's most highly 
regarded catchers, but he has also proved to be a dependable pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes (1-0) picked up a save and a win in relief last week and has two saves 
this season. He has struck out seven batters in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws hard so you can only use him for an inning or two, but he can be 
overpowering when he's on the mound," Mandeville said. "He's got a good 
fastball with good location and he has a decent off-speed pitch."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High won a battle of windmill pitchers as junior right-hander Kym Weil 
outdueled Cathy Lewis of Saugus to give Hart a 1-0 nonleague victory Tuesday 
night at Santa Clarita Park. 
</P>
<P>
Weil (12-1), who has not allowed an earned run this season, struck out 11 and 
pitched a two-hitter. Lewis (7-6), a senior left-hander, pitched a five-hitter 
and struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Dean scored from third base in the sixth for Hart (13-1) on a throwing 
error by Saugus catcher Heather Lonsberry.

STATWATCH: HART ROLLS ALONG DESPITE LOSS OF EDWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the fact that All-Southern Section selection Jason Edwards has yet to 
pitch, Hart High (11-1) is ranked fourth in the nation by USA Today, thanks in 
part to the contributions of two underclassmen. Junior left-hander Andrew 
Lorraine is 4-0 with a 1.06 earned-run average and sophomore right-hander Keith 
Halcovich is 3-1 with a 1.75 ERA. The staff ERA is 1.78. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, a Times All-Valley pick last season with an 11-0 record, has been 
relegated to the role of designated-hitter this season because of an inflamed 
rotator cuff in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting: Hart has seven players batting over .300, the team batting average is 
.349 and the team on-base percentage is .449. Catcher Casey Burrill, who has 
orally commited to USC, is batting .560 with three home runs and three doubles. 
Lance Migita, who has a team-high eight doubles, is hitting .467. David Toledo 
is batting .432 and Robby Davis is at .421. 
</P>
<P>
Streaks: Chatsworth (9-2) has won 21 consecutive West Valley League baseball 
games since a 4-1 loss to Canoga Park in 1987. With a two-game sweep of Taft 
last week, Chatsworth has won 25 games in a row over the Toreadors, a streak 
that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Stolen bases: Darrell Davis of Saugus set a school record last week with his 
43rd career stolen base and has 14 of the team's 35 steals. Ironically, the 
Centurions have been caught stealing only three times all season -- and Davis 
was the man each time. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando's Jess Romero has seven stolen bases in eight attempts and Pat 
Bryant of Cleveland has six steals in seven tries. . . . Westlake's Tim Falsken 
has 13 stolen bases, one shy of the single-season school record. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching: Westlake pitchers Mike Eby, John Brookman and Scott Lerner have 
walked only 18 batters in 74 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi's Pat Bennett, after pitching 30 1/3 innings with an 0.00 ERA, 
surrendered his first earned run in a 12-11 loss to El Segundo on Saturday.

DAVE DISTEL: BASEBALL HERE FOR REAL WITH THE FIRST PITCH OF JUST ANOTHER GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, nothing like Game 2 of the regular season to soothe the soul and introduce 
real baseball for another year. 
</P>
<P>
Game 2? 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the season opener? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing. They had one Monday night. They have one every year. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is getting to be that Opening Night -- notice the capital letters 
-- is more fantasy than reality. Major league teams go from playing a month of 
games that mean nothing to a game that has come to mean too much. 
</P>
<P>
That one game has been promoted for months, almost as though nothing comes 
after it. The Opening Day Starter is a most special pitcher. The stadium is 
decked in red, white and blue bunting. Radio shows originate in the parking 
lot. Ushers wear white dinner jackets. 
</P>
<P>
The season opener is hype and hoopla time. 
</P>
<P>
Give me Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
I know, you're going to say I'm the kind of guy who wears blue on St. Patrick's 
Day, eats sauerkraut on Cinco de Mayo and reads a book on New Year's Eve. 
You're just waiting for me to say, "Bah, humbug." 
</P>
<P>
OK, I confess. I did wear blue on St. Patrick's Day. But I'm not a Bah Humbug 
kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
The season opener, you see, is almost like a party with a game thrown in as a 
sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
Give me The Game . . . all by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Give me Game 2. It has every bit as much of a chance of being a great game as 
the season opener, and each counts as exactly 1/162nd of the season. 
</P>
<P>
So I watched Opening Night on television, my friend Duke adroitly tap-dancing 
back and forth between baseball and basketball with the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
And then I went to Game 2, partially to see if anyone shared my sentiments . . 
. but mostly because it was baseball without the frills. 
</P>
<P>
"Opening Night's special," said Tim Flannery, whose Monday night start was his 
first in a season opener, "but it's nice today because we're just going to play 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
That's all, and that's nice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to a buddy of mine yesterday who goes to a lot of games but 
couldn't get tickets," Flannery said. "I'd already given mine away. I told him 
it was like church on Easter, where everybody who hasn't gone goes." 
</P>
<P>
The pace was much more leisurely Tuesday. Unlike circuses, baseball games are 
meant to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost as if Opening Night was a hurdle rather than a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is centered on Opening Day," said Jack McKeon, the manager. "It's 
like a must situation that you've got to win. It gets blown out of proportion, 
and everything's magnified." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this season opener came at the end of the Padres' best spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
And they lost that season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"We play great during the spring," said Tony Gwynn, "and then we lose our first 
game. We all wanted to play well and win the first game and send a full house 
home happy. So now they go home and say, 'What a bunch of hype. They're not as 
good as we've heard.' " 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't pretty, as the Padres ran themselves out of big innings, and Eric 
Show walked San Francisco into a big inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked ugly," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
On May 17 or June 6 or July 23 or August 11 or even on April 4, there would not 
have been so much attention focused on winning or losing and the little things 
that were a part of that result. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, for one, absorbed some of the heat from that inordinately bright 
spotlight. He had left Show on the mound to work himself out of the 
seventh-inning jam, and the Giants scored three runs to win, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I supposed to do," he asked Tuesday, "alter my style for one 
particular game? 
</P>
<P>
Only if it's the seventh game of the World Series, and maybe not then. It is 
McKeon's style to be patient with his starting pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get burned, and we're going to lose ballgames," he said. 
"You've got to remember that it's a 162-game season." 
</P>
<P>
That's right, but you know what Game 1 is like. 
</P>
<P>
"If you win it," Flannery said, "you're automatically in the playoffs. Right?" 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, of course. 
</P>
<P>
It just seems that way, just as some folks seemed to think losing that season 
opener was like getting knocked out of some single-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After all, how could any team lose the season opener and come back to make the 
playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
So that one game, that one-night trip to fantasyland, was behind the Padres as 
they arrived at the stadium Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said Tony Gwynn, "we have 161 more games. Now we get down to business . 
. . just like if we had won last night." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome, then, to Game 2 . . . and the rest of the season.

Carl Karcher Enterprises: The Anaheim-based fast-food chain reported that 
profits jumped 30% to $21 million in fiscal 1989. Sales totaled $446 million, 
an increase of 21% over a year ago. The company attributed the strong 
performance to the success of new menu items, a major remodeling program and a 
"back-to-basics" strategy.

It's nothing to build a Wednesday night around, but the premiere of "The Robert 
Guillaume Show" is reasonably intelligent and reasonably funny. Compared with 
most sitcoms, that makes it a rousing success. 
</P>
<P>
Airing tonight on ABC, "The Robert Guillaume Show" is getting a tryout in place 
of the modestly rated "Hooperman," which has been put on hiatus. The opener 
finds Guillaume as Edward the divorced marriage counselor, working out of the 
same Victorian house he shares with his tall tale-telling father (Hank Rolike) 
-- "If I'm lyin', I'm flyin' " -- and son (Marc Joseph) and daughter (Kelsey 
Scott). 
</P>
<P>
The niftiest part of co-executive producer Sy Rosen's script involves Edward's 
cranky relationship with his father and his attempts to hire a secretary. One 
of the applicants shows up with a falcon. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as though Edward will hire no one, until in walks klutzy, neurotic Ann 
(Wendy Phillips), and it's chemistry at first sight. Make way for romance. 
</P>
<P>
What's so striking about Edward and Ann as a couple is that he is black and she 
is white, still a rare love match for TV. What makes their relationship work 
initially, however, is that perennial sitcom-star Guillaume and Phillips (who 
did fine work last season on NBC's late, great "A Year in the Life") are 
credible together. They work. 
</P>
<P>
Edward's clients are sort of dumb and his comments to them are predictably 
smart-alecky. But "The Robert Guillaume Show" at least has characters that are 
likable and a premise with promise. 
</P>
<P>
If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'.

COWBOY NAMED KOO PUTS BRAND ON NORTH COUNTY

Jimmy Koo came to this country 23 years ago from his native Korea and went 
country soon after. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old owner of Leo's Little Bit O' Country in San Marcos -- a 
spacious 650-capacity wagon wheel-shaped nightclub where live country music is 
heard Tuesdays through Sundays -- had immigrated to Los Angeles in 1966 to open 
a textile import-export business. Four years later, Koo decided he could no 
longer handle the smog and traffic, so he moved his family and his business 
south to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
When the owner of the Leo's Western Wear store next to Koo's Oceanside business 
decided to retire, Koo rounded up $150,000 in borrowed capital and bought it. 
Thus began the transformation of Jimmy Koo into a Korean cowboy. Soon, he was 
wearing Stetson hats, Tony Lama boots, and Panhandle and Slim shirts with 
silver collar tips. He bought a ranch in Vista and added some horses. And he 
took a liking to the country music that his clientele demanded he play in his 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the music on all day long," Koo said. "And once you really listen to 
country music, you can't help but like it -- the melodies are real pretty, and 
the words mean something." 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Koo sold his Western-wear business -- which by then had grown 
into two stores with a combined area of 14,000 square feet -- and bought a 
struggling rock 'n' roll nightclub called Charlie's in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
He changed formats to country music, changed the club's name to Leo's Little 
Bit O' Country, and soon found himself running the hottest little honky-tonk 
this side of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Leo's underwent a major, $128,000 remodeling job that upped its 
capacity from 300 to 650. And Koo decided to start showcasing one or two 
big-name country acts each month, in addition to such popular local groups as 
the North Forty Band and Crossover. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming concerts at Leo's include appearances by Hank Thompson, April 17; the 
Forrester Sisters, May 28; Eddie Raven, June 25; Steve Wariner, July 18; John 
Conlee, August 3; the Bellamy Brothers, August 27; Bobby Bare, September 10; 
the Charlie Daniels Band, September 24; Michael Martin Murphy, October 8; and 
Freddie Fender, November 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be number one," Koo said. "I don't want Leo's to be just another 
country bar, I want Leo's to be the country bar in all of San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
After Avalon Attractions was given a long-term exclusive booking rights 
contract for San Diego State University's Open Air Theater, the Los Angeles 
concert-promoting company, in conjunction with the school's Associated 
Students, immediately began making a number of physical improvements to the 
4,835-seat amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two months, the entire facility was repainted. The aging wood 
stage was torn down and replaced with a new one made of concrete. Railings were 
installed along the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
And the erection of a weight-bearing roof over the stage, according to Avalon's 
David Swift, "means we can now hang sound equipment and lights instead of 
stacking speakers and amplifiers on either side of the stage and 
ground-supporting the lights." 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, it's a better deal, both visually and sound-wise," Swift said. 
"The sight lines are better because everything is out of peoples' ways. And 
because the speakers are higher up, the whole house -- particularly the people 
sitting near the top -- will get a much clearer sound." 
</P>
<P>
The Open Air Theater's 13th annual concert series began March 25 with a 
performance by British techno-pop superstars Duran Duran. 
</P>
<P>
By October, nearly 40 other top-drawing pop acts are expected to have played 
there; although no dates have been confirmed, possible bookings -- drawn from 
the myriads acts touring the West Coast this summer -- include pop singer Al 
Jarreau, new wave singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, sultry rock queen Stevie 
Nicks, country rockers Jackson Browne and Jimmy Buffett, eclectic rock combo 
Little Feat, and British dance band New Order.

Pepsi is hedging on its support of Madonna. The much-ballyhooed ad the singer 
made for Pepsi, which aired only once in a splashy debut on March 2, will not 
be shown again because it is tied in the public's mind to the controversial 
"Like a Prayer" video, a spokesman for the cola giant confirmed Tuesday. As for 
the financial support of a Madonna concert tour that was also included in the 
reported $5-million deal Madonna signed with Pepsi earlier this year, the 
company's Tod MacKenzie would say only: "No comment." PepsiCo, a conglomerate 
that also includes such businesses as Frito-Lay, Kentucky Fried Chicken and 
Taco Bell, had been targeted for boycott by both the conservative American 
Family Assn. and Catholic Bishop Rene Gracida of Texas. The association's Rev. 
Donald Wildmon said this week that he would end the boycott after being told by 
Pepsi that it would pull the ad and cancel the tour sponsorship. ALEENE MacMINN

Emilio Nicolas Jr. will become general manager of KMEX Channel 34 on April 17, 
a station owned and operated by the all-Spanish Univision network. Nicolas, 35, 
fills the post vacated by Daniel Villanueva, who announced his retirement from 
KMEX last month. Nicolas is currently general manager of WXTV Channel 41 in New 
York and former general manager of KDTV Channel 14 in San Francisco, both 
Univision owned-and-operated stations. "His (Nicolas') commitment to the 
company has been demonstrated many times over and his vast station management 
experience will benefit our flagship station in many ways," said Bill Grimes, 
president and chief executive officer of Univision Holdings Inc., the network's 
parent corporation. Villanueva is retiring June 1 after 18 years as KMEX's 
general manager. Villanueva will continue in a corporate consulting capacity 
with Univision Holdings. ALEENE MacMINN

A standing-room-only crowd of 300 Latino artists assembled in East Los Angeles 
on Monday night to voice their hopes for how money from the new $20-million Los 
Angeles Endowment for the Arts is spent. The throng, like recent gatherings of 
musicians and Skid Row and black artists, expressed a variety of needs for the 
municipal cultural plan whose spending guidelines are still being developed. 
Latino artists have been shut out from major Latino arts institutions, said 
Jose Armand, director of Latino Ensemble, and need spaces to rehearse, perform 
and exhibit their art. "It's time to open some doors, heal some wounds and move 
forward as part of the multicultural expression of L.A.," he said. ALEENE

An anonymous American collector has paid $7.39 million at auction for an early 
cubist painting by Pablo Picasso, "Woman Sitting in an Armchair," Christie's 
London auction house said. The painting, which Picasso started in 1917 and 
completed in 1920, is thought to be modeled on Olga Kokhlova, daughter of a 
Russian general and a dancer whom Picasso met in Rome and married in 1918, 
Christie's said. It was bought by an American collector bidding by telephone 
who wished to remain anonymous. Another Picasso work, "Woman's Head," painted 
in 1921 in the artist's neo-classical style, sold for $5.91 million. A work by 
Paul Klee, "Uplift and Way," painted in 1932, fetched $5.17 million and a work 
by Max Ernst, "Gray Forest," painted in 1927, sold for $1.33 million. ALEENE

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will soon house a new photography 
collection, thanks to a $1.8-million gift from the Ford Motor Co. The amount is 
said to be the largest corporate gift ever received by the museum for the 
acquisition of art. The Ford Motor Company Photography Collection consists of 
500 photographs from the period between the two World Wars. Represented is the 
work of 180 American and European photographers including Man Ray, Laszlo 
Moholy-Nagy, Edward Steichen and Charles Sheeler. The company also will sponsor 
a five-city exhibition of selected photographs from the collection. The 
exhibition, which will be part of an international commemoration of the 150th 
anniversary of the invention of photography, is scheduled to reach Los Angeles 
in May, 1990. ALEENE MacMINN

OPERA SAYS PICKETS WON'T STOP HORNE PERFORMANCE

The performance of mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne will go on as scheduled Saturday 
despite apparent commitments from electricians and stagehands to honor a picket 
line by disaffected wig makers and makeup artists, the San Diego Opera Company 
said Tuesday. But if orchestra musicians refuse to cross the picket line, the 
following weekend's production of "Madama Butterfly" may be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to cancel the Horne recital," opera spokeswoman Brenda Hughes 
said. "No matter what happens, we will do it. There are ways we can do it with 
or without a backstage crew." 
</P>
<P>
The picket line outside the Civic Theatre by the International Alliance of 
Theatrical and Stage Employees Local 706, wig makers and makeup artists, will 
be honored by stagehands and electricians for its duration, said William McLure 
of IATSE Local 122, stagehands and electricians. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the stagehands local are responsible for raising the curtain, moving 
the piano on stage and operating the theater's lights. 
</P>
<P>
"They need a crew to set (the recital) up, of course," said McLure, business 
manager of Local 122. "As long as those pickets from hair and makeup are there, 
we're going to honor them. We're not going halfway. It is indeed a bona fide 
picket line. . . . In our contract with the opera, there is a clause that 
allows us to honor pickets of this nature. We know we're doing the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Pallazola, president of Local 325, American Federation of Musicians, said 
it is up to the discretion of individual opera musicians whether or not to 
honor the picket lines, but added "We think they will." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's performance by Horne requires only piano accompaniment while 
"Madama Butterly" requires a full orchestra. The first orchestra rehearsal for 
"Madama Butterfly" is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The wig makers and make-up artists, who began picketing Monday, are protesting 
the withdrawal Dec. 15 of contracts for the 1989 season. An 
unfair-labor-practices petition has been filed with the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
</P>

McLure and Howard Smit, business manager of the wig makers and makeup artists 
local, met Monday with Gregory Hirsch, the opera's director of productions, and 
said they were close to an agreement before the talks disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
Because stagehands refused to cross the picket line Monday, the opera could not 
unload the scenery for its production of "Madama Butterfly," scheduled to open 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, members of Local 905, wardrobe attendants, also refused to cross 
the picket line to do costume work for "Madama Butterfly." A spokesman for 
Local 325 of the American Federation of Musicians said his union was studying 
whether it would also honor the picket line for Friday's first "Madama 
Butterfly" rehearsal with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"If all those people are going to honor it, it's a big problem for the opera," 
the spokesman said.

PBS SHOW PUTS CHILD CARE IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen industrialized nations have a lower infant mortality rate than the 
United States. If pregnant women and infants were receiving quality health 
care, many of those deaths could be prevented, according to tonight's academic 
PBS documentary, "Caring for Tomorrow's Children," at 10 p.m. on Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Woodruff of "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" hosts an hour of film clips and 
discussion that illustrates the growing political and social interest in the 
issue of child care. 
</P>
<P>
We're given a historical overview, from the administrations of Theodore 
Roosevelt -- who oversaw the creation of the protective Children's Bureau -- to 
Ronald Reagan, whose zeal to limit federal responsibility resulted in more than 
500,000 children being cut from Medicaid in 1982 alone. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from a recent conference with eight former U.S. secretaries of health, 
moderated by Woodruff, proves that the political path to finding answers is 
still a bumpy one. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration's Margaret Heckler, despite the statistics, says 
"we've come a long way in infant mortality" and wants a stronger community 
response. "Infant mortality is localized," she says. Joseph A. Califano Jr., 
secretary under Jimmy Carter, agrees that community involvement is vital, but 
says the federal government must do its part. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Finch, a Richard Nixon appointee, says it's "an oversimplification to 
think we can fix it with a law." Elliot Richardson, who also served under 
Nixon, wants employers to provide the needed health care, with a federally 
administrated program for those not employed. 
</P>
<P>
David Mathews, a Gerald Ford appointee, says that the federal government is too 
"untidy" to bring the issue into sharp focus. 
</P>
<P>
The hour culminates in an interview with President Bush's new secretary of 
Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan. He mentions Bush's proposed 
expansion of Medicaid eligibility -- an expansion that Democrats say doesn't go 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"In tomorrow's children lies our future," Woodruff says. We're shown a few 
community pilot programs that seem to be making a difference with "concern and 
sensitivity," because various local health care agencies have elected to forget 
self-interest and work together. The lesson is obvious. LYNNE HEFFLEY

'AGE OF AIDS' LOOKS BEYOND EPIDEMIC'S STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER

<TEXT>
<P>
As the opening shot in a weeklong salvo of programs on KCET Channel 28 about 
the multiple dimensions of the AIDS crisis, "America in the Age of AIDS" (at 8 
tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24, and at 9 on Channel 50) deliberately removes 
the epidemic from its falsely perceived sociological ghetto. Once a disease 
that hit almost solely gay men and intravenous drug users, AIDS has traveled to 
middle America. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is virtually impossible (and probably wrong) to characterize any town 
or city as typically American, this KCTS-Seattle production, hosted by Linda 
Ellerbee, adopts Ft. Wayne, Ind., as just that city. Though predominantly white 
and family-oriented, it also has poor black neighborhoods and a small gay 
community. Despite being deep in the heartland, Ft. Wayne would inevitably be 
confronted by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Even more crucially (and this is where the cliched AIDS cobwebs are swept 
away), Ft. Wayne is shown as being full of sexually active teen-agers who may 
or may not take the disease seriously. This is complicated by tradition-bound 
parents who believe that frank education on sex and disease in the classroom is 
out of line. Besides clearly showing that no sector of Ft. Wayne -- and, by 
inference, the country -- is immune to AIDS' threat, "America in the Age of 
AIDS" shows how this child-parent complication has its parallel in every other 
community affected by the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being most affecting as a document of personal testimony -- that of 
housewife Bea Harris, for instance, whose brother was one of the city's first 
AIDS victims -- this report subtly depicts an unresolved, ongoing drama: Will 
our innate fear triumph? Or will our innate humanity fulfill its 
potential?ROBERT KOEHLER

FRIEND'S LOAN DEFAULT, GIFT ISSUES COULD HURT WRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON and SARA FRITZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
New troubles for House Speaker Jim Wright emerged Tuesday as a result of 
disclosures that he advocated leniency for troubled savings and loan 
associations at a time when a close friend and benefactor could have benefited 
from such relief. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Wall Street Journal report said that the special counsel 
investigating Wright's affairs for the House Ethics Committee may have 
concluded that an estimated $100,000 in benefits received by Wright and his 
wife were unreported gifts that could constitute a violation of House ethics 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Under those rules, it is improper for members to receive gifts valued at more 
than $100 a year from anyone who has a direct stake in the outcome of 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, questioned about the disclosures, said he had not been aware that Ft. 
Worth developer George Mallick and his family were struggling to repay a 
$2.2-million loan to a troubled thrift in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Speaker was advocating legislation requiring federal 
regulators to show "forbearance" toward ailing S&amp;Ls. That mandate could 
have reduced pressure on the Mallicks' lender to foreclose on the delinquent 
loan, allowing the family to repay the debt over a longer time period or on 
more favorable terms. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mallick's family defaulted on the loan, forcing the thrift to 
foreclose. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. eventually filed a 
lawsuit to recover $1 million of the loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
But the embattled Speaker insisted that Mallick never had asked him for any 
legislative favors during the 30 years that they have known each other. 
</P>
<P>
In pretrial testimony last year, Mallick said that federal regulators were 
partly responsible for the loan default because they gave S&amp;L officials 
little leeway to be as flexible with problem loans as they had been in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal report said that the Ethics Committee is considering 
the possibility that Wright and his wife, Betty, received about $100,000 in 
unreported gifts from Mallick. The $100,000 estimate includes an $18,000-a-year 
salary received by Mrs. Wright from 1978 through 1984, her use of a 1979 
Cadillac and the Wrights' use of a Ft. Worth apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limit Put on Gifts 
</P>
<P>
House rules forbid the acceptance of gifts of more than $100 from "any person . 
. . having a direct interest in legislation." 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with reporters, the Speaker defended his relationship with Mallick 
and said that his wife had earned the money she received from the developer. He 
noted that in 1977, about the time that she started working for Mallick, House 
rules specifically excluded a spouse's income from financial reporting 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the latest developments caused concern among Wright's defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first drop of blood," acknowledged a House Democratic leader who has 
been one of the Speaker's champions during a nine-month investigation by the 
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, as the ethics panel is formally 
known. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wright said that it is "ludicrous" to think that Mallick swayed his 
views on the need for "forbearance" by federal regulators in dealing with Texas 
S&amp;Ls, noting that he had adopted the same position as other Senate and 
House lawmakers from his state. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick, who appeared in the Capitol Tuesday to give a deposition to the Ethics 
Committee on another investment with the Speaker, refused to comment, telling 
reporters: "I am sorry I cannot speak with you." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Wright, who was in her husband's office Tuesday, also refused to discuss 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The developments occurred as the committee neared the end of its deliberations 
on the controversial charges against Wright, first aired by Republicans but now 
causing concern among many Democrats as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Expected Soon 
</P>
<P>
There have been growing doubts that the Speaker will be cleared by the 
12-member panel when it issues a report, expected about mid-April, on its 
marathon preliminary inquiry into Wright's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from exoneration, the committee could approve a statement of possible 
violations by Wright, the House equivalent of an indictment or formal list of 
charges. Then Wright would be able to respond before the panel issued its 
verdict in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick increasingly has become a central figure in the investigation. He and 
his wife, Marlene, joined the Wrights in a business partnership known as 
Mallightco, an investment firm, with each family putting up $58,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Wright's salary from 1980 to 1984, along with the Cadillac she used, was 
financed by Mallightco. From 1978 to 1980, Mrs. Wright had received a similar 
salary from a Mallick-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Got $50,000 Profit 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a real estate investment by Mallightco in Orlando, Fla., produced 
a profit of $50,000 for the Speaker and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate transaction in 1985, Mallick and his wife personally guaranteed a 
loan of $2.2 million from Interwest Savings Assn. of Ft. Worth to Mallick 
Organization Inc., a company owned by their two sons, Michael and Stephen, for 
development of a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick Organization defaulted in September, 1987, on the $2.2 million plus 
$100,000 in unpaid interest. Interwest, already in receivership, foreclosed on 
the property the next month, valuing it at $1.3 million and suing the Mallicks 
in state court for the remaining $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the federal regulator of 
S&amp;Ls, refiled the case in federal court after Interwest was shut down by 
federal regulators last December. The Mallicks contend that the property was 
worth far more than the valuation put on it by the S&amp;L at the time of the 
foreclosure.

GORBACHEV ASKS LATIN ARMS BAN; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SOVIET AID TO NICARAGUA COULD CONTINUE UNDER TERMS OF HIS PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Proclaiming a "real possibility of guaranteeing peace in Central America," 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called Tuesday for an end to "military 
supplies to Latin America from any part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
But by conditioning his plea on U.S. behavior in Central America, he implicitly 
left open the possibility that Soviet arms aid to Nicaragua will continue 
despite a plea from Washington last week that he announce an end to such aid 
during his first visit to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets supply more than $1 billion annually in arms and economic aid to 
the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The United States supplies arms to El 
Salvador, Honduras and other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a brief ceremony at Havana's Palace of Conventions, Gorbachev and 
Castro signed a peace and friendship treaty between their countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Political Means' 
</P>
<P>
The treaty said the two countries would "contribute to the solution of regional 
conflicts and hotbeds of tension through negotiated political means." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Cuba's rubber-stamp National Assembly that wound up his 
three-day visit here, Gorbachev praised the accord agreed to by five Central 
American nations for ending the conflict between Nicaragua and the Contras. But 
he said its success "will depend to a large extent" on the future behavior of 
the United States and Nicaragua's Central American neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about (the U.S.) decision to continue assisting the Contras," 
he said, stressing that the conflict requires "a Latin American solution . . . 
without any foreign interference." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and congressional leaders agreed last month to continue 
non-military aid to the Contras, at the rate of about $4.5 million a month, 
until elections are held in Nicaragua next February. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev curtly dismissed a statement by Vice President Dan Quayle that 
Central America is of paramount concern to Washington because it is the "back 
yard of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"We have analyzed this with Fidel Castro, and we are fully convinced this 
problem can only be solved through political means," Gorbachev said. "There now 
exists the real possibility of guaranteeing peace, and one of the basic 
conditions would be to put an end to military supplies to Latin America from 
any part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
His words, translated as he spoke by a Cuban interpreter, appeared to suggest 
an end to all Latin arms aid by the United States before the Soviets would 
follow suit in Nicaragua. Thus, while his remarks may have created a slight 
opening for discussion, they did not represent the breakthrough that President 
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III apparently had hoped for when 
they called for evidence during the Cuba visit of what Gorbachev has called the 
Kremlin's "new thinking" about foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'U.S. Always Interested' 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popakiuk said: "We are always 
interested in what Mr. Gorbachev has to say. However we will have to give his 
speech careful study before we offer any comments. We will be examining it with 
a view to whether or not it offers the 'new thinking' the Soviets keep 
referring to on various issues." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Soviet leader did restate principles that represent a departure 
from the traditional Marxist foreign policy of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union does not seek for itself political, strategic or military 
advantage in the Western Hemisphere. . . ," he said. "The Soviet Union has not 
and does not intend to have naval, air force or missile bases in Latin America, 
or deploy nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction there." 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the remarks, he warned of "extremely grave consequences" if the 
United States and Pakistan intensify their support of rebels fighting the 
Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev was generally positive in some of his other remarks about the 
United States. During a press conference after the speech, he spoke approvingly 
of U.S.-Soviet cooperation in a treaty to eliminate mid-range nuclear missiles 
and in talks to reduce conventional weapons in Europe and to eliminate chemical 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since World War II we have brought light to the solution of 
international problems that for decades have poisoned international life," he 
said. Adding the hope for continued progress in improving relations with the 
West, he said "we must triple our collective efforts to avoid holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Main Thrust of Speech 
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of Gorbachev's speech concerned Soviet relations with Cuba. 
Before the visit, many observers had described those relations as tense, as 
Castro continued to reject for Cuba the examples of Gorbachev's glasnost 
(openness) and perestroika (restructuring) reforms. The Soviets are known to be 
impatient with the inefficient use of the more than $5 billion in economic aid 
they send annually to Cuba. Soviet experts have urged changes in Cuba's rigid 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev dismissed the speculation "that we would meet as enemies" as 
"pure invention." 
</P>
<P>
"Our friendship today is greater than ever," he said. "Each country solves the 
problems of socialist transformation on the basis of its own political 
experience, its own development, its own traditions." 
</P>
<P>
In introducing the Soviet president with a speech of more than 50 minutes -- 
almost as long as the main event -- Castro also derided the speculation of a 
breach between the longtime allies. "We have no differences whatsoever with the 
Soviet Union," he said, pointing out that the internal difficulties of the two 
countries have been very different. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be absurd to purport that we should apply in a country of 10 million 
inhabitants the formulas of a country with 285 million inhabitants," he said ". 
. . Anyone can see this is madness." 
</P>
<P>
Castro even conceded to the Soviets the right to use capitalist approaches to 
solving problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If a socialist country wants to build capitalism, we must respect their 
right," he said. "We have no right to interfere with that." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared from the remark that if there was a rivalry between the two men 
before their meeting, Gorbachev came out the winner. 
</P>
<P>
The two also dismissed reports that Gorbachev would forgive Cuba's $9-billion 
to $10 billion debt to the Soviet Union. Gorbachev acknowledged that the 
subject was discussed and said "we agreed to continue our analysis." But Castro 
said he did not want the debt forgiven because it exists on such soft terms, 
with frequent rescheduling and postponements, that it is not a problem for 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech and the joint press conference with Castro, Gorbachev called for 
a new "North, South, East and West" dialogue on debt problems, suggesting a 
new, permanent institution in the United Nations to analyze the problem and 
plan strategies to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most serious problems of civilization," he said, adding that 
he did not believe it would be solved until such an organization takes a global 
view of it.

NOVEMBER GAS TAX VOTE CALLED FOR BY GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL ELECTION WOULD DECIDE ON $20-BILLION TRANSPORTATION PLAN, INCLUDING 
9-CENT FUEL HIKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, a longtime opponent of tax increases, Tuesday called 
for a special November election to allow voters to consider a $20-billion 
transportation improvement plan that would include a 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline 
tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before convening the final meeting of his transportation summit, 
Deukmejian outlined a 10-year financing plan for upgrading California's 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
As the governor proposed it, the special election would place three related 
measures before the voters: 
</P>
<P>
* A lifting of the state's constitutional spending limit as it applies to 
additional revenue raised by the proposed transportation package. The spending 
limit, called the Gann amendment after its author, Paul Gann, was approved by 
voters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
* An initial 5-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax hike, to be followed by 1-cent 
increases each of the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
* A $2.4-billion general obligation bond issue for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Truck Fee Increase 
</P>
<P>
As part of the overall plan, Deukmejian also proposed legislation that would 
impose substantial increases in truck fees. 
</P>
<P>
While the governor has the authority to call a special election, the 
Legislature must approve the measures that actually appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said the plan was being presented in "the spirit of compromise" 
and represented his assessment of what would be needed to raise an additional 
$20 billion over the next decade and provide California with "a first-class 
transportation system." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to show that he has not broken faith with his anti-tax 
constituency, the governor insisted that he was not making specific proposals 
but merely picking and choosing the suggestions made by the summit's 
participants that he believed "should be included in a transportation plan if, 
in my judgment, it is to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, however, was so specific and detailed that many Republicans and 
Democrats alike immediately viewed it as the governor's official proposal. Sen. 
William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) offered to revise transportation 
legislation he is proposing to mirror the governor's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell acknowledged that his legislation was defeated Tuesday in the Senate 
Transportation Committee, but he said he will ask for reconsideration. The 
committee meanwhile, approved 7 to 2 a proposal by Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) to 
increase the gas tax 10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
While some business and political leaders taking part in the transportation 
summit meeting were visibly annoyed by the governor's refusal to firmly pledge 
his support for the transportation plan, others interpreted his latest remarks 
as a softening of his position. They said they were encouraged by his 
willingness to both call a special election quickly and to consider a gas tax 
increase that would eventually rise as high as 9 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an important offer but not a conclusion to which we are going to accede 
without a lot of discussion and negotiation," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Roberti and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said they are 
troubled that Deukmejian apparently intended to keep the spending limit intact 
for all other state programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If he intends to do it only for transportation, it won't work," Brown said. 
"We won't do it only for transportation." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said the health-care system in California could have "real problems" if 
it is not also included in the Gann modifications. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to see the Gann limit lifted across the board," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian conceded that the final summit meeting ended without reaching a 
consensus on a transportation plan, but he believed it had narrowed the issues 
enough so that the Legislature would eventually be able to fashion a plan that 
he could endorse. 
</P>
<P>
Although he agreed he had compromised on some issues, Deukmejian said he did 
not believe his "no new tax" reputation had been tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the governor had said he would "not stand in the way" of a gas tax 
ballot measure but had given no indication that he would support it. On 
Tuesday, he surprised transportation leaders by actually suggesting an increase 
and hinting that it could get his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Deukmejian said he had steadfastly insisted that tax increases had 
to be presented to the voters, even though most of the people attending his 
summit -- more than two dozen legislative, business and labor leaders -- 
opposed that idea. Statewide polls have indicated that a gas tax increase of 
more than a few cents would be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
As the final meeting ended, several business leaders said they were now looking 
for ways to win voter approval of a 9-cent gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
David Ackerman, a lobbyist for the Associated General Contractors of 
California, praised the governor for calling for a special election, saying it 
improved the tax increase's chance of passage. A special election, with its 
relatively low turnout, would probably draw a higher proportion of voters who 
favor the increase, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the governor has come a long way, and I think he really deserves 
credit for it," added Tom Ellick, president of the California Manufacturers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But for any transportation plan to win public approval, Ellick contended, it is 
essential that Deukmejian stump the state in favor of a gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take that kind of leadership for the public to understand how 
important this is to the economy of the state," Ellick said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better Transportation, said he 
believes that the major accomplishment of the governor's summit was the 
agreement that an additional $20 billion needs to be pumped into transportation 
in the next decade and that a gas tax increase is essential to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Californians now pay 9 cents per gallon in state gasoline tax and another 9 
cents in federal tax. In addition, they pay a 6% state sales tax.

2 STATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILLS DRAW CRITICISM 
</P>

Two much-touted bills that would provide health insurance for thousands of 
Californians who now have no coverage came under a barrage of criticism during 
their introductory legislative hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The most widely discussed bill, a mandatory health plan carried by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) that would require small businesses to 
provide insurance for their employees, received the most criticism during the 
morning-long subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders said costs of the program would be so high that businesses 
would lay off workers rather than provide them with the required coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic lawmakers on the Assembly subcommittee on health and workers' 
insurance also raised strong objections to the other bill, which would make 
health insurance available to patients with histories of AIDS, diabetes, cancer 
and other severe medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers complained that the measure by Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento) would cost so much -- an estimated $30 million annually -- and 
serve such a small number of Californians -- about 14,000 -- that it would make 
only a small dent in the problem of providing health insurance coverage to 
those unable to get it today. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, the subcommittee chairman, Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles), who has submitted his own health insurance bill, said finding support 
that will lead to passage of any of the bills will "definitely be an uphill 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Brown and Isenberg bills, a third health insurance bill was 
heard by the subcommittee. It is a bill by Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-San Pedro) 
that would make available, for a fee, catastrophic health insurance for all 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers postponed votes on the bills for at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The bills represent an effort to solve problems posed by the estimated 5.2 
million state residents who now lack health insurance. Isenberg said people 
without medical insurance who come down with severe or disabling illnesses have 
"two lousy options: they go without care . . . or spend themselves and their 
families into poverty and then qualify for public assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown's bill would require employers of five or more people to provide 
a basic package of health care benefits. It would cover an estimated 2.5 
million workers said to be unable or unwilling to provide for their own 
coverage. Brown contends that small businesses, by forming pools, could qualify 
for less expensive group insurance discounts and provide coverage for a 
relatively low $100-a-month per employee. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen told lawmakers during the hearing that they view the proposal as a 
thinly disguised tax on business and complained that the Brown bill places the 
burden of the insurance problem on their shoulders without addressing such 
fundamental problems as the high fees doctors and hospitals charge for patient 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"How can any medical center or hospital justify charging a patient $8 for two 
Aspirins?" asked Ralph W. W. Davis of an association called Small Business of 
America. He said most employers would provide medical insurance if they could 
afford to simply because it would help them keep valued employees, who often 
jump from one firm to another because the new employer can provide medical 
insurance. He said mandatory health coverage "would result in employee layoffs 
and would discourage employers from hiring." 
</P>
<P>
Other opponents to the measure include the California Manufacturers Assn. and 
the state Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by the California Medical Assn., hospital groups and 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg's bill would raise $30 million to subsidize a catastrophic health 
insurance plan for those whose medical histories make it difficult or 
impossible for them to buy insurance even if they can afford it. Individuals 
would be required to pay for the insurance, but fees would be capped at 125% of 
what a comparable policy would cost if they were healthy, thus requiring the 
subsidy. The money would come from three sources -- $10 million from an 
increase in worker contributions to the state disability insurance fund, $10 
million from employer contributions and $10 million from tobacco tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg said he hopes that the money will encourage insurance carriers to set 
up plans for the estimated 280,000 diabetics and others being denied insurance. 
But, if private insurers do not set up plans, the legislation provides that the 
state set up its own insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions told legislators that they oppose the plan because it would 
require an increase in disability insurance fees and would also drain money 
from a fund that was set up to provide income protection to disabled workers. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin, although saying he was in general agreement with the Isenberg bill, 
criticized it for "promising more than it can deliver" because the insurance 
could be afforded by only about 5% of the 280,000 people eligible for it. 
Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton) complained that the money to 
subsidize the bill would come from disability and other funds designed for 
other purposes.

DEUKMEJIAN WARILY SKIRTS ENDORSEMENT OF TAX BOOST 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian would like to be remembered as the governor who never 
raised taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And so in calling Tuesday for a special statewide election to consider a 
$20-billion transportation package, the Republican governor carefully 
orchestrated his announcement so he would never have to endorse the tax 
increase that is the centerpiece of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my proposal," Deukmejian insisted only hours after presenting the 
plan to the press and then to two dozen of the state's top transportation 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In talking with reporters, the governor repeatedly refused to say even whether 
he supports the proposal he outlined, which includes a gasoline tax hike of 9 
cents per gallon and a $2.4-billion bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian scolded the Capitol press corps saying, "Get off this business of, 
you know, does the governor support this or doesn't he, or is the governor 
changing his position or not changing his position." 
</P>
<P>
After six years in office, Deukmejian is caught in a sensitive predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Under his tight-fisted fiscal leadership, the state's network of roads and 
highways has become so congested that many of the governor's own supporters in 
the business community are clamoring for increased spending to solve the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the governor has repeatedly pledged that he would not raise 
what he calls "general taxes," whether to pay for transportation improvements 
or any other program. 
</P>
<P>
So in an attempt to balance between the two, Deukmejian proposed placing the 
$20-billion transportation plan before the voters -- but refused personally to 
take a stand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"What I said to the public when I ran for governor on two occasions was that I 
was not going to support general tax increases," he explained. "This approach 
leaves it up to the people to decide whether or not they want to increase their 
own taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian acknowledged that "there are some features of this that I do not 
support." But he added it would be "premature" to give his views on the 
proposed ballot measure. "I want to reserve my answer to that question for a 
little later in the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assumes Limited Role 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal outlined by Deukmejian, his only role in placing the package 
before the voters would be to call a special election. It is up to the 
Legislature to actually place the tax hike and spending plan on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Deukmejian has become the focus of questions about 
whether he supports a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he proposed raising $800 million in new revenues to make up for a 
drop-off in expected state funds. He insisted that the plan was merely "a 
temporary minimal adjustment." But after legislators and the press labeled it a 
tax increase, he angrily withdrew the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a fiscal crisis early in his Administration, Deukmejian approved a 
series of tax increases in 1983. One, a short-term increase in the statewide 
sales tax, never took effect because the state's revenues increased with an 
upswing in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of other tax hikes Deukmejian approved remain in effect 
today, including an increase in motor vehicle fees, a sales tax on video 
rentals and higher property taxes brought about by the elimination of lengthy 
delays in reassesing property when it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Silva, an adviser to Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles), estimated that the tax increases cost taxpayers $3.7 billion in the 
first five years after the governor signed them into law. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said the transportation package he outlined Tuesday represented a 
"consensus" of the legislative, business and labor leaders he called to a 
series of "summit" meetings over the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is fair to say what I gleaned from those discussions is 
incorporated in the major elements of this package," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stood Nearly Alone 
</P>
<P>
While the elements of the package appeared to enjoy the general support of 
those attending the summit, Deukmejian stood nearly alone in his insistence 
that the package be submitted to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
If the governor wanted to disavow fathering the proposal, however, some of his 
Republican allies did not get the message. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased Gov. Deukmejian has offered this statesmanlike plan to meet our 
transportation needs," Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson said in a press 
release.

ARAB LEAGUE SEEKS BEIRUT TRUCE IN FACE OF PITILESS ARTILLERY FIRE

Terrified Lebanese residents, crammed 40 to 50 in basements of shell-battered 
buildings, Tuesday faced the fourth week of a pitiless artillery showdown, 
pinning their only hopes on an Arab League truce plan. 
</P>
<P>
As shelling resumed with fresh intensity early Tuesday afternoon, political 
sources said an Arab League committee, trying to arrange a cease-fire, plans to 
ask Lebanon's army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads the country's 
Christian-led Cabinet, to end a sea blockade of ports, the act that sparked the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
The committee would also ask Syria's Muslim and leftist allies to lift their 
siege of the Christian enclave, controlled by Aoun's men. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of shelling echoed across the capital for the 22nd day of violence, 
which started after Aoun imposed the blockade. It has now engulfed one-third of 
Lebanon in the heaviest artillery bombardments in 14 years of civil war, a 
confrontation that has dwarfed most earlier fighting. 
</P>
<P>
After a savage night in which thousands of shells rained on more than 100 areas 
in the capital, the mountains and the Syrian-held Bekaa Valley of eastern 
Lebanon, shelling eased briefly. 
</P>
<P>
A few shells hit Christian areas in Beirut and Druze-held mountains to the 
southeast, but fighting later intensified with shells hitting Christian coastal 
areas north of Beirut and others slamming into residential areas in Muslim West 
Beirut close to the battle-scarred "green line" that divides the capital into 
Christian and Muslim sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim fighters of the Hezbollah (Party of 
God) militia joined Syria and its Lebanese allies against the Christians, 
United Press International reported. The Hezbollah fighters were seen fighting 
alongside their former rivals of Amal, another Shiite militia, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Since March 14, at least 123 people have been killed and 473 wounded in the 
fighting pitting Syrian gunners and their local Muslim allies against mainly 
Christian troops. Most of the casualties have been civilians. 
</P>
<P>
"Just around my house in one small street there were mounds of debris, scores 
of burned cars and carpets of glass," said a resident of Christian East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"People are living in shelters all day and night long . . . 40 or 50 people 
together," another resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 residents managed to flee the capital on Monday and Tuesday, 
taking a ferry to Cyprus from the northern port of Juniyah. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, in command of an estimated 15,000 troops in Lebanon's Christian sectors, 
has vowed to drive Syria's 32,000 soldiers from Lebanon even if the battle 
flattens Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
His vow followed a flare-up of fresh violence after he imposed a blockade on 
illegal ports, even those outside his control in Syrian-dominated areas. 
</P>
<P>
The ports provided the main source of income for several of the country's 
sectarian militias and are their source of supplies in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has maintained a strong military 
presence there since 1976, when a Syrian-dominated Arab League peacekeeping 
force entered the country to restore order after the outbreak of the civil war. 
Aoun's determination to force out the Syrian troops has posed a challenge to 
Damascus' role as a major force in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Al Baath, publication of the ruling Baath party, termed Aoun a 
"crazy general." Political sources say that Iraq, Syria's Arab arch-rival, is 
giving the 54-year-old general full support in what he calls a "liberation 
war." 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Arab League committee plan calls for an immediate 
cease-fire, an end to the blockade, the reopening of crossing points on 
Lebanon's Christian-Muslim divide and a two-month truce. 
</P>
<P>
Committee officials plan to meet with Muslim and leftist militia leaders in 
Damascus today and Christian leaders later in Amman, Jordan, to discuss the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The truce would allow the committee to try to find a political solution," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up earlier this year to tackle a constitutional deadlock 
that has left Lebanon without a president since September. But it is now more 
immediately concerned with ending massive bombardments of civilian areas. 
</P>
<P>
Christian political sources said Aoun refuses to end the blockade and insists 
on the Syrian pullout. 
</P>
<P>
A Muslim political source said that Salim Hoss, acting Muslim premier who heads 
a Syrian-backed government vying for power with Aoun's military one, suggested 
to the Arab League that Aoun "end his blockade without publicizing it, but Aoun 
has not responded yet."

1,000 CHINESE LAWMAKERS BALK AT OFFICIAL MEASURE

<P>
China's legislature, ending a 16-day annual session Tuesday, marked a new 
milestone toward a more open political system when more than 1,000 delegates 
refused to endorse a bill submitted to them. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which would grant lawmaking powers to the Shenzhen Special Economic 
Zone adjacent to Hong Kong, passed all the same, with the support of 1,609 
delegates. But the event marked the first time in the legislature's history 
that a significant percentage of delegates failed to support a decision in a 
public vote. 
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, whose role is to discuss and approve decisions 
taken by the ruling Communist Party Politburo, used to give unanimous public 
endorsement to all draft laws and resolutions presented to it. Last year, in 
what the official Chinese media treated as a major step forward for political 
reform, a tiny minority of delegates spoke and voted against various decisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Somber, Cautious Mood 
</P>
<P>
This year's session unfolded in a somber mood of concern about problems that 
have cropped up in the course of China's economic reforms, especially the 
acceleration of inflation, which ran at an official rate of 26% in 1988. Before 
the session began, delegates were privately instructed to keep any criticisms 
within rather narrow limits. In general, there was less of an atmosphere of 
free-wheeling discussion than during last year's congress. 
</P>
<P>
It was not entirely clear Tuesday whether the unprecedented number of negative 
votes and abstentions on the Shenzhen bill was primarily an orchestrated 
attempt at making a show of democracy, or whether it constituted a rebellion by 
delegates upset about procedural shortcomings. It appeared to have elements of 
both these factors, rather than being a protest against the actual contents of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote was held, Huang Shunxing, a former legislator in Taiwan who now 
lives in China and is a congress delegate, stepped to a microphone in the 
auditorium of the Great Hall of the People to argue that the handling of the 
bill did not follow proper procedures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First to Argue Publicly 
</P>
<P>
Huang also created a stir at last year's session when he became the first 
delegate in the body's history to publicly argue, in the presence of foreign 
media, against a proposed decision. The issue last year involved a minor 
personnel question, and the vote went nearly 2,900 to 8, with 69 abstentions, 
against the position favored by Huang. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Huang won not only applause but also votes in apparent support of 
his arguments. A total of 274 delegates raised their hands to cast negative 
votes on the Shenzhen bill. A moment later, in the most dramatic moment of the 
entire congress session, 805 delegates raised their hands to abstain. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative and party leaders sitting on the huge auditorium's stage -- 
including congress Chairman Wan Li, moderator of the session -- appeared 
surprised and slightly unsettled by the massive number of abstentions, which 
created the image of a sea of hands previously seen only on affirmative votes. 
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen bill authorizes the special zone, adjacent to Hong Kong, to enact 
its own laws suitable for a market economy. Delegates appeared to be upset by a 
number of technical questions concerning the proper way to grant this power to 
Shenzhen. Among the issues involved was whether the National People's Congress 
or the Guangdong Province People's Congress is the proper body to grant this 
authority, and whether such authority may be given before Shenzhen has 
established its own people's congress. 
</P>
<P>
Huang, the only delegate to speak on the subject from the floor, stressed in an 
interview after the congress that his objection was based on procedural issues.

"It's not permitted to do things this way," he said. "It's not a question of

<P>
The eight other resolutions and laws presented to the congress Tuesday, 
including a law setting rules for lawsuits against government agencies, were 
approved with overwhelming majorities. 
</P>
<P>
The congress never formally addressed a sensitive issue that various Chinese 
intellectuals had lobbied for: a proposed amnesty for political prisoners, 
especially some prominent pro-democracy advocates who have been jailed for 
about a decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petitions Still Viable 
</P>
<P>
But the official New China News Agency reported late Tuesday evening that a set 
of petitions in support of amnesty, seized by Tianjin customs officials after 
being brought to China last week by Hong Kong activists, had been forwarded to 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in keeping with the 
request of the Hong Kong group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Hong Kong group, who had hoped to deliver the materials while 
the full congress was in session, said last week that the petitions had been 
signed by more than 24,000 people from Hong Kong and 34 countries. 
</P>
<P>
In another development related to the issue of free speech, students at Beijing 
University put up a poster Monday calling on school authorities to rescind 
recent "lawless" regulations banning campus gatherings to discuss democracy and 
political change. The poster, which bore the signatures of 60 undergraduate and 
graduate students, was torn down Tuesday.

Israeli journalists said they will refuse to report on Jewish settlers in the 
occupied territories after some settlers pretended to be correspondents by 
putting press signs on their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Shaked, head of Israeli journalists covering the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, said Monday that correspondents are in greater danger covering the 
15-month-old uprising because Palestinians now doubt the identity of real 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply announced we would no longer cover any activities the settlers 
initiate which might endanger our personal security," Shaked told Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Militant settlers traveling in vans bearing press signs clashed several times 
with Palestinians last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately everyone wants to be a journalist. The police disguised as journalists. 
Now the settlers put up the press signs and in the name of journalism carry out 
activities no journalist would," Shaked said.

ISRAEL TO FREE 200 ARABS AS A GOOD-WILL GESTURE

Israel plans to release at least 200 Palestinian prisoners from jail today so 
they can be home for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, government officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The good-will gesture is also apparently designed to have some effect in 
Washington, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir holds talks with President Bush 
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III this week. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the largest prisoner release since the start of the Arab uprising 
almost 16 months ago, and it comes amid strong urging from Washington that 
Israel try to ease tensions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials hedged when asked if the timing and scope of the release were 
connected with Shamir's trip as well as with Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relevant Reasons 
</P>
<P>
"If you write that both reasons were relevant, you would be making an 
intelligent guess," a Defense Ministry official said. "Of course, because the 
prime minister is in the United States, everyone should pay more attention." 
</P>
<P>
Another official said, "Ramadan? Shamiradan!" 
</P>
<P>
Israel holds about 6,000 Palestinians in prison, more than 1,000 of them under 
military-ordered administrative detention and without benefit of trial. Some of 
the detainees are organizers of the rebellion. Others are accused of hurling 
stones. A few are as young as 14. Two weeks ago, Israeli authorities released 
about 150 Arabs from prison. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has hinted that Israel should reopen schools in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Israel may use Ramadan as an opportunity 
to comply, government officials said. It was not clear which schools might be 
reopened and at what grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy School Closures 
</P>
<P>
Schools throughout the West Bank have been closed virtually since the start of 
the uprising. Israeli authorities in the Gaza Strip have been more lenient, 
closing the schools only from time to time. The government regards schools as a 
hotbed of unrest even though there has been no notable reduction in violence 
since their closure. 
</P>
<P>
The army plans to return loudspeakers to several mosques so they can be used 
for calling the faithful to prayer. The loudspeakers, which are customarily 
mounted on tall minarets at most mosques, were taken down because they have 
sometimes been used to incite Arabs to protest or to attack soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Ramadan, which begins Friday, is the holiest month of the Islamic calendar. A 
time of fasting and prayer, it marks the period when, according to Muslims, the 
Prophet Mohammed received the verses of the Koran from God. More than 80% of 
the 1.7 million residents of the West Bank and Gaza are Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the intifada, or uprising, maintained its pace. There were several 
violent protests in the West Bank and Gaza. In Jerusalem, a stone-throwing 
incident on Salah Edin Street, the main Arab shopping area, prompted police to 
order shops closed and to seal off the street. A tourist was hit in the head 
with a rock, and a public bus was stoned. 
</P>
<P>
The latest leaflet of guidelines from the underground leadership of the 
intifada calls for stepped-up violence in the coming weeks.

PENTAGON QUICKLY LEARNS THAT CHENEY IS IN CHARGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his first day on the job, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney got lost in the 
basement of the Pentagon. Two and a half weeks later, people are asking him for 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after taking office on March 17, Cheney fired the acting Air Force 
secretary and told the Navy secretary to start looking for a job. The next 
Friday, he publicly dressed down the Air Force chief of staff, a four-star 
general, for "free-lancing" defense policy on Capitol Hill. The next Wednesday, 
he dismissed the undersecretary of defense in charge of weapons acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Ten weeks into the Bush Administration, the Pentagon finally has a boss. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney denied in an interview Tuesday that his goal is to put the generals and 
admirals "back in a box" or that he sees a need to reassert civilian authority 
at the Defense Department. But his actions have sent an unmistakable signal to 
everyone in the sprawling agency, 2 million men and women in uniform and 1 
million civilians, that Cheney is running the show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Struggle Denied 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I believe in civilian control," Cheney said, speaking to a small 
group of newspaper reporters in his gold-carpeted Pentagon conference room. 
"That's my job -- to run the department. To do that, it's necessary from time 
to time to lay down markers of what is expected. But I don't feel as if I'm 
engaged in any kind of a struggle with anyone for control of the department." 
</P>
<P>
The six-term Wyoming congressman compared his Pentagon job to that of a 
cowpuncher in charge of a wayward herd. "It's a big department with a lot of 
bright, capable, talented people in it. Oftentimes, they don't move in the same 
direction. Sometimes, you've got to get them herded up and headed down the 
right trail." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney entered the Pentagon under extraordinary circumstances. The department 
had been essentially leaderless since President Bush took office on Jan. 20. 
Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV, a holdover from the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, ran the agency while the Senate bitterly debated former Texas 
Sen. John Tower's fitness to be defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing vacuum, all sorts of decisions were deferred, from budgetary 
matters to key personnel appointments. Only one of the department's two dozen 
top officials -- Deputy Defense Secretary-designate Donald J. Atwood -- had 
been named. 
</P>
<P>
Tower was rejected by the Senate, 53 to 47, on March 9 because of his history 
of heavy drinking and his close ties to defense contractors. Bush nominated 
Cheney the next day; the Senate confirmed him a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney already has sent the White House a list of his choices for most of the 
top policy-making positions at the Defense Department. He has rejected most of 
the "Tower Mafia" who were expected to get top jobs had Tower been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney brought with him a number of former House aides, including David 
Addington, who will hold the title of special assistant to the secretary of 
defense and who will occupy a spacious office adjacent to Cheney's suite. 
</P>
<P>
The office previously housed an Air Force colonel who controlled the critical 
paper flow to the secretary and who has been moved to a smaller office down the 
hall. The secretary's paper work is now routed through Addington. 
</P>
<P>
Addington formerly served as Cheney's aide on the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence. He has also worked at the Central Intelligence 
Agency and at the White House as a legislative affairs aide. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have the requirement to have the best possible people available 
around me," Cheney said Tuesday. "I think there are duties and obligations, 
responsibilities that are most appropriately given to a military officer; 
others are most appropriately given to a civilian." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that replacing the colonel with a civilian was not intended to 
downgrade the military officer's post or to freeze the uniformed services out 
of the secretary's office. But that is how the move is being read throughout 
much of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Addington's appointment "gives policy power to civilians who are supposed to be 
making policy," said an approving senior military officer who formerly was a 
military assistant to a senior civilian official at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheney, if he curbs the military influence in the office of secretary of 
defense, will be off to a good start," the officer said. "These guys are 
advocates for their services more than anything else. (Cheney's office) ought 
to be all civilian."

SOVIETS SELLING SOPHISTICATED JET BOMBERS TO LIBYA, U.S. SOURCES SAY

The Soviet Union has sold sophisticated jet attack aircraft to Libya that would 
give Libyan strongman Moammar Kadafi's government greater capability to strike 
longer-range targets in the Middle East, including Israel, Pentagon sources 
said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The planes are SU-24 Fencers, which have an unrefueled radius of more than 800 
miles, said the sources, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are believed to have sold 12 to 15 of the planes to the Libyans, 
the sources said. The price is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has been a major purchaser of Soviet military equipment in the last 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The SU-24 bombers have been broken into pieces, crated in large boxes and 
delivered to the Libyans, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The deliveries have been infrequent and at irregular intervals, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Fencers are likely to be based in eastern Libya, possibly 
at Al Bumbah. From there, the planes could fly round trip, without refueling, 
to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that the Soviets have also 
agreed to refit a Libyan transport plane, the Soviet-built Ilyushin 76, so that 
it can be used as an in-flight refueling plane.

GOP HOPES DASHED IN DEEP SOUTH RACE

Democrat Glen Browder won a solid victory Tuesday in a special congressional 
election, dashing Republican hopes to use the race as a building block toward 
GOP gains in the Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
With all of the 656 precincts reporting, the unofficial count showed Browder 
with 53,031 votes, or 65%, to Republican John Rice's 28,787, or 35%. 
</P>
<P>
The seat was left vacant in December with the death of Rep. Bill Nichols, a 
conservative Democrat from Sylacauga who held the mostly rural, 13-county east 
Alabama district for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which is about 75% white and dotted with small towns, appeared 
ready-made for the GOP's plan to bring such conservative-leaning Southern seats 
into the Republican House column next year. President Bush captured more than 
60% of the district's votes last November.

A 5-year-old girl was tied, gagged and spanked shortly before her mother and 
two others tried to sell her for $5,000 last week, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The child, Naomi Shasta Kroum, is quoted in the documents filed this week as 
saying that a white sock was stuffed in her mouth, her hands were tied and she 
was paddled by her mother, Brenda L. Hubbard, 20, and Michael R. Lund, 28. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, Lund and Carolin L. Vaughn, 24, were arrested March 30 when they tried 
to sell the child to an undercover FBI agent at the Reno-Cannon International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer to Sell 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn had telephoned Elly Kibbey of Tacoma, Wash., offering to sell the child. 
Kibbey and FBI Agent T. Trier, posing as her husband, flew to Reno, where the 
deal was made. 
</P>
<P>
The three are held on charges of kidnaping, child abuse and receiving 
compensation for a child. Bail has been set at $100,000 for each, 
</P>
<P>
The three, plus three children, had been living in a converted school bus. 
Vaughn, previously convicted of arson in Washington State, is also charged with 
being an ex-felon in possession of a .357-caliber Magnum and possession of 
cocaine and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arraigned in Justice Court and a preliminary hearing was 
scheduled for April 18 to determine whether there is enough evidence to hold 
them for trial.

If teachers earned grades, Mary V. Bicouvaris would get an A plus. Bicouvaris, 
who has been teaching classes in American government at Bethel High School in 
Hampton, Va., since 1963, was named National Teacher of the Year. The 
49-year-old Greek immigrant said her formula for teaching government and 
international relations combines "respect for my job, love for the children 
that I teach and a very sincere commitment to make a difference." Known to her 
students as Mrs. Bic, she founded and directs an award-winning Model United 
Nations program at her school and organized a schoolwide celebration of the 
200th anniversary of the Constitution. Her teaching ideas on the Constitution 
were turned into a booklet circulated among educators nationwide. President 
Bush is scheduled to present her with a crystal apple today. Bicouvaris is the 
38th recipient of the award, which is sponsored by the Council of Chief State 
School Officers, Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. and Good Housekeeping magazine. 
Bicouvaris will spend the next year speaking to organizations around the 
country.

President Bush and his son Marvin were beaten in the start of the tournament by 
two aides, Tim McBride and David Bates, but the score is classified. Bush 
dropped by Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater's office to disclose his defeat, 
urging Fitzwater not to "tell anybody." The President formally dedicated the

White House workers, including chefs, groundskeepers, carpenters, ushers and 
photographers, is expected to go on for several more days.

 -- Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is still in demand in Wyoming. The former 
Wyoming congressman will be in that state at Wheatland High School on May 20, 
and at Upton High School the next day, to speak at graduation exercises, said 
Pete Williams, Cheney's spokesman. Upton High School Principal Mark Mitchell 
said the 26-member senior class invited Cheney before his nomination early last 
month as defense secretary. Mitchell said the students had been worried that 
Cheney now would not have time for them. Last week, however, Cheney's office 
contacted the high school to see "if we still wanted him," Mitchell said.

The quake that shook the San Francisco Bay area Monday was predicted by U.S. 
Geological Survey scientists, said a USGS seismologist in Menlo Park. "We knew 
there would be an earthquake here," said Al Lindh. "Honest we did." He said he 
and his colleagues foresaw that a mile-long stretch of the Calaveras Fault was 
due for a 9.5-kilometer-deep quake with a magnitude of just over 5, because 
stress was building. The quake was slightly weaker than they expected. The USGS 
measured it at 5.0, while University of California seismologists read it at 
4.4. No major damage resulted and no injuries were reported.

Former Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham -- impeached and removed from office a year ago 
-- said he will run again in 1990. "I committed no impeachable offense," the 
Republican said at an evening rally at a hotel in Phoenix. The audience of 
about 400 gave a standing ovation to Mecham and his wife, Florence, when they 
arrived. The 64-year-old former auto dealer, elected in 1986 on his fifth try 
for governor, was convicted by the Arizona Senate and removed April 4, 1988, on 
charges he misused funds and obstructed justice. Earlier in the day, Mecham 
said he had filed papers with the Senate asking it to reconsider the votes by 
which it impeached and ousted him. Senate leaders said they doubted lawmakers 
would grant the motion.

The Soviet Union's leading writers have formed a chapter of the international 
writers organization PEN and, in their first action, appealed for revocation of 
calls for death for Salman Rushdie, author of the novel "The Satanic Verses." 
The writers declared that they condemned both insults to religious and ethnic 
feelings as well as demands for retribution, the weekly Literary Gazette said. 
Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has called for the death of 
Rushdie for what he considers insults to Islam in the novel.

Imprisoned members of West Germany's extremist Red Army Faction rejected an 
offer of mediation by parliamentary leader Rita Suessmuth and will continue a 
63-day-old hunger strike "even if it means they starve to death," their 
attorneys said in Bonn. The lawyers said the Red Army members will stop their 
fast only if authorities meet their demand to be moved from separate cells 
among those of other inmates to common holding areas where they can be 
together. Thirty-eight Red Army activists and sympathizers imprisoned at 
various sites around West Germany have taken part in the hunger strike.

A sudden flash of natural steam with temperatures surpassing 600 degrees 
injured three workers at the Navy's geothermal energy plant at the China Lake 
Naval Weapons Center, authorities said. Sam Berry of Cal Energy, the company 
that operates the 80-megawatt natural steam-driven facility, said the three men 
were engulfed by the steam while cleaning screens in steam lines. It was the 
first mishap at the new plant, which went into service Friday. George Wagner, 
61, was in stable condition at Ridgecrest Hospital with first- and 
second-degree burns over 40% of his body. William Bridgham, 30, and Brian 
Cwetzig, 33, were treated and released. Steam at Coso Hot Springs, which powers 
the electricity generating facility, is measured in excess of 600 degrees. The 
geothermal project will eventually generate enough power to furnish electricity 
to 160,000 homes.

William M. Baker, a key aide to CIA Director William H. Webster, is taking the 
rare step of returning to the FBI as assistant director in charge of the 
criminal investigative division. The move by Baker, a 22-year FBI veteran, who 
went from the bureau to the CIA with Webster in 1987, is designed to strengthen 
the FBI's management team, which has been drawing criticism from some Justice 
Department officials. Baker, who served as the FBI's No. 2 man in Los Angeles 
and headed the bureau's Portland office before moving to Washington as 
assistant FBI director for congressional and public affairs, will succeed Floyd 
Clarke. Clarke has been elevated to executive assistant director. Intelligence 
sources, saying that Baker's move does not indicate Webster plans to leave the 
CIA, noted that the CIA director is looking for a replacement for Baker.

Demands for more concessions from the Polish government threatened to unravel a 
sweeping reform package agreed to in marathon talks among official 
representatives and leaders of key Polish opposition, business and church 
groups. Shipyard workers and farmers joined official Communist trade unions in 
opposing the complex agreement, but Solidarity union founder Lech Walesa said 
he remains confident that opposition leaders will sign a pact with the 
government. The signing ceremony has been scheduled for today. The agreement 
calls for re-legalization of the outlawed Solidarity union, partially free 
elections to Poland's nominal Parliament and other political reforms.

HAITI REGIME BOWS TO PRESSURE, DEPORTS 3 WHO LED COUP MOVE

The government bowed to pressure from mutinous soldie1 rs and said Tuesday that 
it has released from jail and deported three army officers who tried to 
overthrow Haiti's leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels surrendered control of the international airport, which reopened Tuesday 
for the first time since Sunday's coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy here said there no longer appeared to be any active resistance 
in the army to the government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's no doubt that President Avril is completely in control now," 
said embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde. "There are no signs of a continuation of 
the coup attempt against him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Coup Leaders 
</P>
<P>
A government communique identified the three alleged coup conspirators as Lt. 
Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards Battalion; Col. Phillipe Biamby, 
commander of the Presidential Guard; and Col. Leonce Qualo, an administrative 
officer at army headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The government accused Rebu, Biamby and Qualo of a "foolhardy" attempt to 
overthrow the government but said Avril has "magnanimously" decided to free 
them from arrest on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The communique, read on state-run television, said the three were given safe 
passage to the United States and were driven Monday night to the Dominican 
Republic border for a flight out. Rebu was accompanied by his wife and four 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Independent Radio Haiti-Inter said Tuesday that the Leopard Battalion has 
accepted its new commander, Col. Lionel Claude -- a strong indication the 
insurgency had ended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crossed Border at Dawn 
</P>
<P>
In Santo Domingo, Foreign Ministry sources said the Haitians crossed the border 
at dawn. It was not known how long they would remain in the country before 
flying to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the coup leaders was seen mainly as an attempt to appease soldiers 
of the elite, 300-man Leopard Battalion, who were demanding freedom for Rebu, 
their commander. 
</P>
<P>
At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killed Monday in 
skirmishes with troops loyal to Avril. The rebels briefly seized control of 
national television Monday before being evicted by the Presidential Guard, and 
they held the airport until late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The airport was reopened Tuesday, but all commercial flights into the country 
had been canceled earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Schools remained closed, but most stores in Port-au-Prince, the capital, were 
opened by midday Tuesday, and traffic was picking up steadily.

CAPSIZED BARGE SPILLS LYE INTO OHIO RIVER

Authorities said Tuesday that there was no immediate threat to wildlife or 
water supplies from a barge loaded with 160,000 gallons of lye that ran aground 
and capsized on the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
The barge was one of 15 being transported by a tugboat around a sharp bend when 
it broke away and ran aground near the rocky shore, Lt. Cmdr. Arthur Adkins of 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup and removal of the barge is expected to take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 20 miles southwest of Parkersburg at Long Bottom, 
Ohio, and Murraysville, W.Va., near where a barge also carrying lye ran aground 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
No leaks were detected in the latest incident, Adkins said, but small amounts 
of the lye solution, known as sodium hydroxide or caustic soda, may be seeping 
through vents in the barge.

NFL TEAMS UNSURE OF IMPACT AFTER FREE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FRIEND, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last two months, National Football League teams essentially have 
swapped special teams players, which should make for some exciting kickoffs 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the impact of this free agent activity -- the final count had 229 of 
619 unconditional free agents changing teams -- is impossible to gauge until 
play begins this fall. The Washington Redskins spent much time and money 
(approximately $800,000 in signing bonuses) on the project, which ended at 
midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers signed a league-high 20 players, although a new 80-man 
training camp limit means they might not have room for many upcoming draft 
picks. Major cuts could come after minicamp. The Kansas City Chiefs signed 17 
free agents, the Redskins 15 and Cleveland 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Oilers suffered a mass exodus, losing 15 players. "Have you ever 
been hunting?" Oilers Coach Jerry Glanville asked. "Well, if they shoot a deer, 
they take a knife out and gut him. We've been gutted." 
</P>
<P>
Some teams grew disinterested. The Bears felt they shouldn't sign other teams' 
loose baggage. The Bears and Bengals picked up no one, though Chicago did 
deliver an offer sheet to Houston defensive end Ray Childress. 
</P>
<P>
"The only winners," Bears personnel director Bill Tobin said, "are agents, 
airlines, telephone companies and doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Good doctors actually were a necessity, considering most of the unprotected 
players were injured reserve types or hurt in some way. In Dallas, the Cowboys 
seemed certain wide receiver Mike Sherrard's brittle leg -- broken twice -- 
would scare away interested teams and left him unprotected. Bet a San Francisco 
physician reportedly passed Sherrard on a physical and advised the 49ers to 
lure him. The final deal was close to $1.3 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, there are those in the players' union who find this reckless free 
agency to be a fraud, that the owners designed it to influence a Minneapolis 
federal judge in an upcoming antitrust trial. And the union, to back its 
argument, points out that protected players -- the prominent quarterbacks and 
running backs in the league -- stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," responded Giants General Manager George Young, "I can't understand 
why the union is mad Dan Marino can't be more of a millionaire than he already 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, owners might not have lost much money with these signings. By 
reducing training camp rosters to 80, they're saving cash that was spent on 
these free agents. 
</P>
<P>
But was it advisable spending? According to sources, the two highest 
unrestricted free-agent contracts went to nose tackle Bob Golic (from Cleveland 
to the Raiders) and quarterback Gary Hogeboom (from Indianapolis to Phoenix). 
Both reportedly will earn $600,000 next season. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFC East, the activity varied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington Redskins: Of the 15 players signed, it's possible only one will 
start -- punter Greg Horne. General Manager Bobby Beathard said last week he 
only expects former Rams lineman Fred Stokes ($125,000 signing bonus) and 
guard-tackle Ray Brown (formerly with Phoenix) to emerge as first-, second- and 
third-down contributors. The rest are special teamers, though Beathard said he 
hoped that tight end Mike Tice (Seattle) would bulk up and maybe play more. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins wouldn't mind fast development from two new cornerbacks, Martin 
Mayhew (from Buffalo) and Eugene Profit (from New England). With cornerback 
Darrell Green on the trading block and cornerback Brian Davis having a history 
of injuries, both newcomers could find themselves in the thick of a New York 
Giants game. Also, wide receiver Stevie Hobbs (from Kansas City) runs a 
4.4-second 40-yard dash and could emerge as their kickoff and punt returner, 
though he's tiny. 
</P>
<P>
And why all the long snappers? The team has three -- Ralph Tamm (from the 
Jets), Mike Morris (from Phoenix) and last year's starter, Dave Harbour. The 
coaches want someone who can not only snap, but also play a position, and Tamm 
and Morris have that capability. Harbour, meanwhile, wasn't big enough last 
year to help out on the line, but this season he wants to try out as a blocking 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Giants: -- At last report, they had signed only four-three 
defensive players and a long snapper. One is safety Greg Cox from the 49ers, 
and though he was merely a wedge-buster, Cox got $75,000 to sign and base 
salaries in the $200,000 range. Nose tackle Jim Burt, like the Redskins' Russ 
Grimm, turned down a substantial raise (from the Packers) and will be welcomed 
back with a few other Giants who decided to stay put. "We'll take 'em all 
back," Young said. "These guys don't have leprosy or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phoenix Cardinals: They signed 11, the method being to tease players with 
their warm weather. One signee was Reggie McKenzie (from the Raiders), brother 
of the Redskins guard Raleigh McKenzie. Actually, the Redskins pursued Reggie 
McKenzie, too, but didn't want to get in a bidding war because Raleigh McKenzie 
is a protected free agent and about to negotiate a new deal. If Washington had 
given a bundle to Reggie, starter Raleigh would've become more difficult to 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Philadelphia Eagles: Coach Buddy Ryan keeps handing his right outside 
linebacker spot to ex-Bears. A year ago, Todd Bell converted from strong 
safety, but got steamrolled. Now, Ryan has signed Al Harris from the Bears, and 
Bell's back in the secondary. Ryan thinks the Bears were silly to use Harris as 
a defensive end and predicts he'll be a stellar linebacker in Philadelphia. 
Other signings (the Eagles had five) included speedy running back Mark Higgs 
from Dallas and punt returner Henry Williams from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dallas Cowboys: New Coach Jimmy Johnson says he was too busy evaluating his 
own players to see anyone else's. Of Dallas' five signings, two are ex-Redskins 
-- center Eric Coyle and tight end Anthony Jones.

HERSHISER CLAIMS HIS STREAK IS OVER

Dodger relief pitcher Jay Howell lifted the receiver from the wall phone in the 
visitors' clubhouse here Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Bulldog, it's for you," said Howell, beckoning to Orel Hershiser, who was 
holding court with about a dozen reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Handing the phone to Hershiser, Howell said: "It's Margo somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser broke up, as did everyone within earshot, except for teammate Ricky 
Horton, who strolled out of the trainers' room and innocently inquired: "Orel, 
is she still calling you?" 
</P>
<P>
With no game to be played, the Dodgers were playing it strictly for laughs 
Tuesday during their optional workout at Riverfront Stadium. And who better to 
target than Hershiser, who tonight against the Reds gets down to the serious 
business of trying to pick up where he left off last season, which in a way is 
almost as improbable as his being a phone pal of Margo Adams. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, the matter of Hershiser's record of 59 scoreless 
innings, which applies only to regular-season games and thus will be extended 
by as many zeroes as Hershiser can post against the Reds tonight. At least, 
that's the way baseball's statisticians view the record. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"They can tie it together with an asterisk, but the streak is over in my mind," 
he said. "If I give up a leadoff triple, I'll gladly trade an out for a run if 
it means we win the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather beat the Reds than shut them out and lose the game in extra 
innings." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser was referring to his last regular-season start on Sept. 28, the one 
in which he broke Don Drysdale's record by shutting out San Diego for 10 
innings, only to have the Padres win the game, 2-1, in 16 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The streak began last Aug. 30 in Montreal, when Hershiser blanked the Expos for 
the last four innings of a 4-2 win over the Expos. He followed that with 
successive shutouts against Atlanta, Cincinnati, Atlanta again, Houston and the 
Giants before surpassing Drysdale's record by an inning in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He went eight scoreless innings against the New York Mets in Game 1 of the 
National League playoffs before yielding two runs in the ninth inning of a 3-2 
loss, a game he refers to as the low point of the season. He shut out the Mets 
in Game 7 of the playoffs, then blanked Oakland in Game 2 of the World Series 
before giving up two runs against the A's in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been so long," he said. "I've given up runs. I gave up runs in spring 
training, 10 against the Detroit Tigers. Doesn't that count? How can it feel 
like a streak to me when I've given up runs?" 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who would have been the Dodgers' opening-day starter if he hadn't 
been stricken with the flu in the last week of spring training in Florida, said 
he is eager to begin in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be fun," said the 1988 Cy Young Award winner, who had a 23-8 
record, a 2.26 earned-run average, and allowed just 31 hits and 11 walks during 
his record streak. "The biggest thing now is the challenge. Last year is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a challenge, because of the expectations, because opposing hitters 
are going to be up for beating me and beating our team." 
</P>
<P>
While Hershiser attempts an encore to his unprecedented success, another Dodger 
pitcher, Fernando Valenzuela, was looking forward to his first start of 1989, 
Friday night in Atlanta. He hopes to begin erasing the memory of a misbegotten 
1988, during which he won just five games and experienced his first serious arm 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
And despite a spring training of decidedly mixed results -- Valenzuela's ERA 
was above 5 and his fastball barely pushed 80 m.p.h., the left-hander seemed 
serene about the task before him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to go," said Valenzuela. "It's good for me and the team if I stay 
healthy, and my shoulder feels strong right now." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was put on the disabled list for the first time in his career last 
July 31 with what was described as a stretched muscle in his shoulder, ending 
his streak of 255 starts without missing a turn. Frank Jobe, the Dodgers' team 
physician, advised against surgery and put Valenzuela on a rigorous exercise 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela has yet to pitch more than five innings in a game this spring, but 
said he's primed to take Friday's start as far as he can go against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my arm feels better now than any time in my career," he said. "But 
it's real hard when you go almost six months without throwing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who averaged more than 255 innings a season from 1981, his first 
full season, through 1987, also averaged about 14 complete games a year in that 
time, the period in which he developed his reputation as one of the foremost 
closers in the game. But he absolves Manager Tom Lasorda for having him throw 
too many pitches in too many games, even though 160-pitch outings were not 
unheard of for Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not why I hurt my arm," he said. "I stayed healthy for 7 1/2 years 
here, and five more years before that in the Mexican Leagues. I was lucky to 
stay healthy that long. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot from my injury last year. Now I'm not forcing my arm to throw 
the ball so hard. When I threw too hard, I'd drop my arm or short-arm the ball. 
But now I don't throw it as hard, because I know my ball will still move. I 
just try to go easy and let it go." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that the velocity isn't there -- he estimates he's lost at 
least 5 m.p.h. from his fastball -- but predicts that as the season progresses, 
he will pick up some of that lost speed. 
</P>
<P>
"And I know more about how to pitch," said Valenzuela, a seasoned veteran even 
though he won't observe his 29th birthday until Nov. 1. "Location is more 
important to me, because my screwball still has its good rotation."

ANGELS GO DOWN SWINGING; 
</P>
<P>
BRAWL ENLIVENS OPENER AS REUSS, WHITE SOX WIN, 9-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They changed the uniform. They changed managers. They changed the lineup. They 
even changed their ways, throwing the season's first brushback pitch and waging 
their first bench-clearing brawl before the sun had set on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. The streak lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, winless in the regular season since Sept. 18, 1988, lost 
consecutive game No. 13 Tuesday, beginning a new season by extending an old 
record with their 9-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox before an Anaheim Stadium 
crowd of 33,265. 
</P>
<P>
The streak that has already claimed two managers -- Cookie Rojas, 0-4, and 
Moose Stubing, 0-8 -- has reached out and touched a third, Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt, the Angels' No. 1 starting pitcher, couldn't stop it. Spring 
Wunderkind Dante Bichette, a surprise starter in left field, couldn't stop it. 
Home runs by Devon White and Claudell Washington couldn't stop it. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the burden has been passed to Chuck Finley, the 26-year-old pitcher 
who had a 9-15 record last year and will start for the Angels tonight. 
</P>
<P>
What a fine mess the Angels have gotten themselves into. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Rader didn't try to shake things up. Tuesday, he shook good and plenty 
-- writing Bichette and Tony Armas into the starting lineup, writing Washington 
and Chili Davis out of it, and leading a charge to the mound in the ninth 
inning when Chicago's Ivan Calderon objected to the location of one of Angel 
reliever Bob McClure's pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The location was Calderon's left hand. The timing was seconds after McClure had 
served up a two-run homer to Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
Putting two and two together, Calderon glared at McClure, then flung his helmet 
at him and then rushed him, bringing the two together on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, springing from the Angel dugout, nearly beat Calderon there. Soon, both 
teams were surrounding the mound, engaging in the first Anaheim Stadium 
scrummage of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too old for that . . .," Rader said. "I was getting dragged around pretty 
good. But you have to protect your pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
On an afternoon when the Angels were beaten by the oldest opening-day battery 
in major league history -- Jerry Reuss, 39, pitched a seven-inning two-hitter, 
catcher Carlton Fisk, 41, hit a solo home run -- Rader took solace in the 
knowledge that, unlike last September, the Angels didn't go down without a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody on this team is afraid to show some emotion," Rader 
said. "Everybody cared enough to be out there (on the field). The fact I was 
involved is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can find a plus, even in an area like that, I think that's important." 
</P>
<P>
McClure and Calderon were ejected for their roles as instigators, but Rader 
seemed to delight in the whole scene, especially the message pitch delivered by 
McClure, the 35-year old import from the National League, where they do things 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at the audacity of the umpires, to think he was throwing at 
him," Rader said, failing to suppress a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Just a little old-time baseball, Rader suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played, these things didn't happen," he said. "Being hit by a ball 
didn't instigate a fight. But that was back in the dark ages. We played without 
any rules then. There was no knockdown rule. 
</P>
<P>
"You show that kind of emotion after getting hit by a pitch and you were 
probably going to get creased with good regularity after that. You've got to 
show it didn't bother you." 
</P>
<P>
McClure, who dodged Calderon's helmet but not a couple of blows to the head, 
shrugged off the incident as "part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came up," McClure said, "you get hit around a little, you dust 
somebody off and you go on with the game. I was trying to brush him back. The 
ball just got away a little." 
</P>
<P>
McClure also brushed back questions about Calderon's quick display of temper. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit on the head a couple of times, but I've been hit harder by my kids," 
he said. "That's (Calderon's) prerogative. He was just trying to protect 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Around the Angel clubhouse, McClure was applauded for his pluckiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what Mr. McClure did," Angel relief pitcher Greg Minton said. "Of 
course, the ball just happened to get away from him, but I like it." 
</P>
<P>
And from losing pitcher Witt, who allowed four runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 
innings: "That's a good sign. (McClure's) never been in this organization or on 
this staff before. I haven't seen that very often around here." 
</P>
<P>
In the White Sox clubhouse, Torborg talked of seeing good signs amid the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"That's good," he said of the mini-melee. "That means the game meant something 
to both teams." 
</P>
<P>
For the Angels, that feeling has largely been missing since last September, 
when the longest losing streak in franchise history first began. 
</P>
<P>
The streak is still alive but, finally, the same can now be said for the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Potential controversy loomed in the Angel dugout before Tuesday's game when 
Doug Rader posted his opening-day lineup -- and neither million-dollar 
outfielder, Chili Davis or Claudell Washington, was on it. Instead, rookie 
Dante Bichette and veteran Tony Armas had been penciled into the No. 5 and No. 
6 slots in the batting order. Armas was there, Rader explained, because his 
track record (3 for 5) against Chicago starter Jerry Reuss was substantially 
better than Washington's (2 for 14). And Bichette for Davis? "It's nothing 
against Chili," Rader said, "but I've got to get a couple of people into the 
lineup. Dante's been swinging the bat as well as any human being can. They have 
a left-handed pitcher going. If the kid can do a little something against him, 
good. He made the ballclub for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was less than enthralled with that reasoning, but decided, for the 
record, to let the issue lie. "I've got to leave it alone," he told reporters. 
"You'd just better ask the manager." Washington, meanwhile, let his bat do the 
talking, delivering a pinch home run in his first Angel at-bat in the eighth 
inning. After the game, Rader announced that both Davis and Washington would be 
starting tonight's game, with right-hander Eric King starting for Chicago. King 
replaces scheduled starter Melido Perez, who was scratched by Manager Jeff 
Torborg because of a muscle strain. 
</P>
<P>
Angel reliever Greg Minton, on Tuesday's ninth-inning brawl: "It was tame. I've 
got to be honest. It was tame, as far team-to-team things go. The really good 
ones, you have four to five fights breaking out across the whole ball field, 
but I'm sure it wasn't tame to the two guys in the middle of it." . . . The 
Angels Tuesday unveiled their redesigned uniform, which features a button-down 
top, a black belt and a bigger, brighter 'A' on the cap. Opinion: Thumbs up on 
the buttons and the belt, but the new A is a tad gaudy. . . . In keeping with 
this year's All-Star game theme, nine former Angel All-Stars participated in 
the first-ball ceremony: Rick Burleson, Doug DeCinces, Brian Downing, Ken 
Forsch, Wally Joyner, Bobby Knoop, Johnny Ray, Bill Singer and Clyde Wright. A 
10th All-Star, Mike Witt, was occupied warming up in the bullpen.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS: KINGS VS. OILERS; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS TAKE AIM AT STANLEY CUP; 
</P>
<P>
TRADES HAVE GIVEN GRETZKY AN EXPERIENCED SUPPORTING CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Wayne Gretzky characterizes the Kings as having "new blood, new 
enthusiasm, new excitement," he's not thinking just about himself. The winning 
attitude that has the Kings talking seriously about a bid for the Stanley Cup 
does not begin and end with The Great One. 
</P>
<P>
Although attention has been focused on Gretzky and the four Stanley Cup teams 
he played on, the Kings' front office has been busy dealing for a veteran 
supporting cast that is surprisingly long on playoff experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings as a franchise may not have had much playoff success, but the players 
who now constitute their roster have. Gretzky isn't venturing into tonight's 
opening game of the Kings' seven-game playoff series against the Edmonton 
Oilers on his own. 
</P>
<P>
What about John Tonelli? Tonelli, 32, who was signed as a free agent last June, 
even before the Gretzky trade was made, can match Gretzky's Stanley Cup 
collection, having helped the New York Islanders win the trophy in 1980, '81, 
'82 and '83. And he played in the Stanley Cup finals with the Islanders in 1984 
and with Calgary in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley brought Stanley Cup experience with them, 
too, when they came to Los Angeles in the Gretzky trade. Krushelnyski, 29, 
helped the Oilers to three Stanley Cups, in 1985, '87 and '88, and was in the 
finals in 1986. McSorley, 25, was also in the finals in 1986 and won Cups with 
the Oilers in '87 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kasper, 27, and Jay Miller, 28, who came to the Kings in a late-season 
trade for Bobby Carpenter, played for Boston in the Stanley Cup finals last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And Doug Crossman, 28, played in the Stanley Cup finals with Philadelphia in 
1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey, 28, was acquired from the Islanders just before the trading 
deadline specifically because of his playoff experience. Hrudey was on the 
Islander team that played in the Stanley Cup finals in 1984, even though Bill 
Smith was in goal. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, though, Hrudey has played in 27 playoff games, including his 
memorable play for the Islanders in a 3-2 victory that went four overtimes 
against Washington in Game 7 of the Patrick Division semifinals in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Duguay, 31, who was acquired from the Rangers in February of 1988, played 
in the Stanley Cup finals with the Rangers in 1979 and has been in 78 playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, the Kings have picked up players who have brought with 
them a total of 771 games of playoff experience. That's in contrast with the 
total playoff experience of the players who had been with the Kings all along, 
136 games. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into the playoffs, you get into big-time pressure, and there's no 
substitute for having been there before," Tonelli said. "The highs are higher 
and the lows are lower, and you have to know how to respond. . . . You have to 
be able to keep your composure and use all that nervous energy to your 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli says that with a smile, adding, "I really like playoff time." 
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky said: "This is what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
It's time to come alive. 
</P>
<P>
"You can feel it in the room," Gretzky said. "Everyone is excited. . . . The 
attitude right now is positive, upbeat. There are guys like Steve Kasper and 
John Tonelli getting the guys to push themselves, to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
And there's Duguay, too. He's setting a good example for anyone who wants to 
notice. He's at the rink early and late. He's getting his rest, eating 
carefully, doing his stretching. He's the picture of focus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through this 11 times now," Duguay said. "The first time, I was so 
young. We made it to the Stanley Cup finals, and I thought that was great. At 
the time, I thought that I was doing my best. I also thought that there would 
be a Stanley Cup in my future and I could just sit back and let everything fall 
into place. It would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I have seen how hard it is to win the Stanley Cup, what it takes to 
win, I don't take anything for granted. At this point in my career, I am 
craving the Stanley Cup. I am craving the satisfaction you feel as a team when 
20 or 25 guys make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I have such a respect for the guys like Wayne Gretzky who have been able to 
make it happen. I appreciate what they have accomplished. I think there are so 
many guys on this team that feel the same way that we'll all be giving it our 
best and knowing that our efforts are not going to waste." 
</P>
<P>
And although Duguay has never won it all, he has been close enough to see what 
it takes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing the way the intensity builds with every game," Duguay said. 
"Everybody is playing his best. Everybody wants to win. When it gets down to 
the last five minutes of a game and the pressure is on, everything becomes 
instinct. It becomes a question of who really is best prepared, who really is 
most ready." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't just happen. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli has been watching the team prepare itself for the last couple of weeks, 
and likes what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't begun yet, but right now I think we're putting everything together 
the way we should be," he said. "I think we have the right attitude to be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a mature team, but we're having fun. I'm having fun. For the last few 
years, everyone else was treating me like I was washed up. This team has given 
me new life. I've never had so much fun playing hockey. Everyone is working 
hard, but we're enjoying it. And I think we're all thinking the same way. We're 
coming together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, too, has been stressing the importance of teamwork, saying: "What 
happens in losing situations is that people start worrying about their own jobs 
and start thinking about their own, individual accomplishments. More things 
fall into place when you're playing well as a team. When the team is winning, 
individual accomplishments take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie (Nicholls) is a perfect example of that. He played with a better team 
this season and he ended up with 70 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The nicest thing that has happened all year is that the individual attitude 
has disappeared. That's a big step forward for the team. . . . There was a lot 
of talent here to start with. We've added some people with winning experience. 
It has all mixed in well." 
</P>
<P>
Added McSorley: "You don't want everybody to be an old vet. You want that 
eagerness and excitement. But at the same time, it's reassuring to have a guy 
like Tonelli, who can say something and guys will react to him and trust him 
that he knows what he's talking about. And guys like Timmy Watters who was on 
the Winnipeg teams that upset some people. 
</P>
<P>
"You also need guys who have won the Stanley Cup, who know that winning the 
Stanley Cup is something that is attainable. It makes the others believe it can 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the Stanley Cup is not just a dream, something that's out of the 
everybody's reach. We can say, 'Look at us. We've done it. We can do it.' You 
have to play every game like it's your last, but if you do all the things 
you're supposed to do, the Cup is there, within reach." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will open their playoff series against the Oilers tonight at 7:30 at 
the Forum in a game that will be televised by Prime Ticket and broadcast by 
KLAC (570). . . . Goalie Glenn Healy, who missed the final game at Vancouver 
because of a fever of 102 degrees, practiced Tuesday and is expected to be 
ready for tonight's game. . . . The Kings split their regular-season series 
against the Oilers, 4-4. The teams were so evenly matched that even the total 
goals were equal at 36 each. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, trying to minimize the emotional factor involved in this series 
because it was Edmonton that traded him away, said: "I'm looking at this series 
as a steppingstone toward winning the Cup. Just like when we used to have 
rivalry-type series with Calgary. We always wanted to beat Calgary as a 
steppingstone to the Cup. I know those (Oiler) players. Just to beat L.A. 
doesn't mean anything except that it puts them a step closer." . . . Marty 
McSorley, acknowledging that a lot of the emotion of this series is "a spinoff 
of what happened on Aug. 9," noted: "Wayne doesn't show a lot of excitement, 
but he is into it. It's not a question of pressure. For him, it's a strong 
focus. He is determined -- as they will be. You can tell when he's ready." 
</P>
<P>
The first two games will be played at the Forum, tonight and Thursday night -- 
and the Kings are asking fans to wear silver and black, the King colors, to the 
games -- and the next two games will be in Edmonton, Saturday and Sunday. As 
needed, the next games will be at the Forum Tuesday, at Edmonton April 13 and 
at the Forum April 15.

Baseball salaries soared 14.6% this year, raising the major league average to 
$512,804, according to an Associated Press study. Moreover, the study found, 
there are 107 players, about one in six, making $1 million or more, including 
18 at or above $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had the top average salary, $852,518, a 27% increase from the start 
of last season. The Dodgers, whose payroll has doubled in two years, have eight 
players making $1 million or more, matching the Boston Red Sox for the most on 
any team. The Dodgers are also the first major league team on which every 
player makes at least $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets, who lost to the Dodgers in last fall's National League 
playoffs, have the second-highest average, $778,308. The American League East 
champion Boston Red Sox are third at $754,583 and the New York Yankees fourth 
at $708,247.

NEWSWIRE: ARIZONA ACTS AGAINST PLAYERS IN ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three of the four Arizona freshman football players arrested last month in 
connection with a series of campus assaults have been suspended from the school 
for two years and a fourth has been put on probation, the university's dean of 
students said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalind E. Andreas said that the three players must decide this week whether 
to accept or appeal the sanctions. She would not name the suspended students, 
but four players -- offensive lineman Michael Bundy, defensive back Samuel 
Edwards, quarterback Sean Hutson and walk-on wide receiver Jeffrey King -- were 
arrested March 9 and charged with misdemeanor assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The players were accused of a series of random attacks in which 11 people were 
beaten during a two-hour period. Several were treated at hospitals for bruises 
and black eyes, and at least one was treated for a broken nose, police said.

John Bedwell of Stockton remembers the day, 13 years ago, when he became a 
professional bass fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy came into my (service) station with this Chrysler bass boat. I said, 
'Geez, what kind of boat is that?' He says, 'That's a bass boat. I'm a 
professional bass fisherman. I fish tournaments.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No kiddin'. I wanna go with you.' 
</P>
<P>
"So he took me out one time for a club tournament, and we were almost late, had 
to race back (for the weigh-in), and the adrenaline was pumping. He got first 
and I got third, and I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Bedwell, 39, and his peers are not commercial fishermen. They don't sell what 
they catch. They don't even keep it. They fish like other recreational 
fishermen, only harder and better. And under a lot more pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever need to catch a fish to pay the rent? Bedwell did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fishing a big tournament in 1981 and doing lousy, right down to the last 
day of the tournament," he said. "At that time my wife was pregnant and wasn't 
real sure about me fishing and was really on my case, telling me how I 
shouldn't be there. Things were getting tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Next day I went out with a spinning rod, four-pound test line and a little 3 
1/2-inch worm. About 2 o'clock in the afternoon I still didn't have anything, 
and I'm thinking my wife is right. I just made a cast (toward) the bank and 
caught a 6.22-pounder. It was the big fish of the tournament. I won a $15,000 
boat and about $2,000 in prize money." 
</P>
<P>
Such are the fortunes of fishing. Bedwell sold his station. 
</P>
<P>
"And now my wife thinks this is the greatest thing in the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One cast! One cast turned it around for me." 
</P>
<P>
There are several pro bass fishing circuits in the Western United States, with 
competition within a day's drive virtually every weekend. They include West 
Coast Bass, the Red Man Tournament Trail, sponsored by a tobacco company; WON 
BASS, sponsored by Western Outdoor News, and U.S. Bass. 
</P>
<P>
The purses are still less than princely. First place is usually worth $5,000 or 
$6,000, but most events are geared to weekends so competitors can hold regular 
jobs, which most of them need. 
</P>
<P>
Unless they can win one of the circuit's major events -- $60,000 cash for the 
West Coast Bass Invitational, or $35,000 in cash and prizes -- i.e., a boat -- 
which Jerry Tilton of Orangevale, Calif., won in the West Coast Bass Classic 
here last month -- they need to place in the top 10 any weekend to pay 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the anglers are men -- three women compete regularly on the West Coast 
Bass circuit, none from Southern California -- and most of them aspire to 
compete in the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS), which has run the 
BASSMASTERS Tournament Trail through the South for 22 years and pays more than 
$100,000 to winners of its major events. 
</P>
<P>
By the time an angler gets together a boat, motor and tow vehicle, expenditures 
total about $35,000, and entry fees are about $500 for each event. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, we used to camp," Bedwell said. "We didn't even have a van. 
It was tough. If you don't feel like you should be there, if you feel like you 
should be home working, then you're not going to catch any, anyway, 'cause your 
mind's somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Bedwell smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"At the awards, you'll hear whoever wins get up and say, 'You know, it's not 
really the money. It's having the respect of my peers and the fishing 
industry,' and all that. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's important to me, too, but you can't put that in the bank. If we 
go to a tournament and we don't place, the guy will say, 'Well, you got good 
points toward the end of the year classic,' but you can't put those points in 
the bank, either." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but what a life, right? 
</P>
<P>
Bedwell stared. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends and neighbors and relatives all say, 'Oh, what a great job. You go 
out and fish for eight hours and get $12,000 for winning.' 
</P>
<P>
"They don't see the eight hours of preparation, the three days of traveling to 
the lake, three days home. It's 110 degrees in my garage and I'm out there 
servicing the boat, putting line on rods the whole day. 
</P>
<P>
"For every day of fishing, there are two days of preparation." 
</P>
<P>
It's 4 a.m. in the parking lot of the Golden Spike Inn and Casino near Boulder 
City, Nev., up the hill from Lake Mead. The 31 anglers who won the 76 events on 
the West Coast Bass circuit the past year are already in their boats, on the 
trailers, but they have all had a good night's sleep, ignoring the bright 
lights and gaming tables. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the boats are towed to the lake to be launched. Dawn's early light 
reflects off the water as the boats -- all 18-foot Rangers with 150-horsepower 
Yamaha engines lent for the event -- line up three abreast alongside the dock, 
in order of their starting draw. An official observer is aboard each boat to 
guard against cheating. 
</P>
<P>
The national anthem plays over a loudspeaker, then Doug Pieper, assistant 
tournament director, bellows -- honest, he does -- "Gentlemen, start your 
engines!" 
</P>
<P>
They must all return by 3 p.m. to weigh their catches, which are limited to 
five fish on each of the two days. Most will arrive near the marina a few 
minutes early and continue fishing, even if they have their limits, hoping for 
a big one to replace a smaller one. Total weight for two days wins. 
</P>
<P>
All of the fish are kept in "live" wells aboard the boats and returned to the 
lake at the end of the day. West Coast Bass held three straight tournaments at 
one point last year without killing a single fish. 
</P>
<P>
The first-day leader is a veteran, Dee Thomas of Brentwood, whose practice two 
days earlier has paid off. Thomas motored 185 miles around the lake, refueling 
twice, but checking every hole possible. 
</P>
<P>
But luck deserts him the next day and he places 15th overall. 
</P>
<P>
"Luck in tournament bass fishing is not having bad luck," Bedwell said. "Luck 
is when you do make that cast and get that 6.22 on four-pound test line, that 
he doesn't jump and throw the hook out, or have your rod break or your engine 
break." 
</P>
<P>
This is the life Jay Yelas of Phoenix, at 23 one of the younger pros, has 
chosen since graduating from Oregon State with a degree in fisheries biology 
two years ago. Yelas has been about the hottest thing going in the West the 
last year. He will be competing in the WON BASS Open and the Nevada BASSMASTER 
Invitational next week, both on Lake Mead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used the West like a minor league in baseball to get a lot of experience 
and make a little money and gain a lot of confidence," he said, "and then next 
year I plan on going back East and fishing some of the BASS tournaments. That's 
kind of the big leagues of bass fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Don Iovino of Burbank disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it's stepping up to the major leagues," Iovino said. "I think 
we're the major leagues here, too. The one thing they have that we don't have 
is a well-run tournament organization and a lot of press and TV. If you have 
that, you have money. We have just as good fishermen in the West as anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But Iovino, who once quit a career as an aircraft mechanic to fish full time, 
has his own related fishing businesses to support himself and is heavily 
sponsored -- witness the accumulation of patches on his shirt. He conceded that 
prize money isn't large. 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably won in the course of my fishing career about $210,000, and I've 
won about everything there is to win," he said. "I've been fortunate. But the 
sport in the last two years has been climbing fast. We're starting to get 
national attention now." 
</P>
<P>
Yelas won about $60,000 last year. "But it cost me $30,000 to compete," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even for the big winners, a boat, rather than cash, makes up most of the purse, 
but a good bass boat, with its motor, trailer and electronic fish-finding gear, 
costs $20,000 or more. The anglers usually dispose of them at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
"I had four boats at one time last year," Yelas said. 
</P>
<P>
Do pro fishermen have any secrets? 
</P>
<P>
Bedwell says an angler must understand that fish aren't necessarily stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just like people," he said. "Some of 'em have higher IQs than others. 
That's how they get big." 
</P>
<P>
Yelas attributes much of his early success to Bill Sedar, 75, who has been 
fishing man-made Lake Cachuma near Santa Barbara since it opened and "knows 
more about largemouth bass than anybody I've ever met. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for young people to get involved because financially it's draining," 
he said. "It takes all of your resources. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give up practically everything to get your foot in the door."

COLLEGE DIVISION / MITCH POLIN; 
</P>
<P>
SWITCH TO TWO-DIVISION FORMAT FOR ALL SPORTS ADOPTED BY NAIA MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the exception of football, the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
has always operated under a one-division format. 
</P>
<P>
But that will be changing next year. 
</P>
<P>
The NAIA will be forming a Division II, with scaled back competition, for 
baseball, men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball, starting as 
early as fall, 1990. Currently, football is the only NAIA sport with a Division 
II. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of a Division II for sports other than football had been discussed 
as early as 1986, and last year the NAIA agreed to submit the proposal to a 
formal vote of member schools. In February, a vote was taken on the four sports 
and the new division format was approved by wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest was (women's) volleyball, which was about 64%," said Cliff Hamlow, 
athletic director at Azusa Pacific University and a member of the NAIA's 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new format, schools may compete in Division I in some sports and 
Division II in others, depending on budgetary qualifications set forth by the 
NAIA. The qualifications are based on a school's financial resources and 
monetary commitments to its programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's trying to evaluate the emphasis of your program versus other programs at 
your school," Hamlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools will have until June 1 to pick their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Hamlow said that for the most part, the new division structure is a positive 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it gives the schools an opportunity to choose what level of 
competition they want to play at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also likes the concept of schools competing in different divisions, 
depending on the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a plus, especially if you want to emphasize one sport over 
another in your program," Hamlow said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a school's decision on its levels of competition will be a question of 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to ask yourself if the reason you compete in intercollegiate sports 
is to compete for a national championship," Hamlow said. "If you say yes, then 
(competing in) Division II is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the schools in the NAIA District III would qualify to compete in 
Division II under the NAIA criteria. But Hamlow thinks most of the District III 
schools will choose to compete in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to make any difference here on the West Coast because 
we're going to still compete against the same teams all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll Land, longtime baseball coach at Point Loma Nazarene and NAIA president 
in 1981 and 1982, said a preliminary discussion among Golden State Athletic 
Conference teams indicated a preference for competing in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"In reality, all of us technically fell into Division II, but I don't think any 
of us want to play Division II," he said. "I think we all like the idea of 
competing for a Division I championship. . . . When we think of being NAIA 
Division II champion, who in the world is going to give a rip?" 
</P>
<P>
Land said he didn't see the addition of Division II as a positive step for the 
NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been philosophically opposed to it in all my (29) years in the NAIA," 
Land said. "My belief is we had a very good thing going where we had 
approximately 420 schools going for an NAIA championship. I think in the NCAA 
Division II and III you have less than half that (number). 
</P>
<P>
He said that dividing the schools into divisions dilutes the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you legislate in this way, the question is, 'Where do you stop?' 
" Land said. "Obviously in the NCAA you have to do that but in the NAIA there 
are only about 10 schools or so that are comparable to (NCAA) Division I 
schools (financially). 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, we only have a handful of programs (in the NAIA) that are 
consistently stronger than the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Hamlow said there was more demand for establishing a Division II in the 
Midwest, where some private schools must compete in the same districts as state 
schools that have more funds available. 
</P>
<P>
But Land said there are only a few schools that fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's necessary for (improving) the level of competition and 
the budgetary concerns at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamlow and Land both added that it will be difficult to judge the full impact 
of the legislation until it takes effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a wait-and-see thing for all of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the baseball season, Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo were the favorites in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But with the conference season approaching its midway point, it would be 
difficult to pinpoint a front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at the start of the week only three games separated the teams that 
were in first and last places in the conference. San Luis Obispo was in first 
at 8-5 and Pomona was second at 8-6, but the others were not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was 7-7, Cal State Northridge 6-6-1, Cal State Dominguez Hills 6-6, UC 
Riverside 5-7-1 and Cal State Los Angeles 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders were more established in other College Division conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran was leading the Golden State Athletic Conference at 9-2 after 
splitting a doubleheader with second-place Azusa Pacific, 7-3, last week. 
Defending champion Claremont-Mudd-Scripps was in first again in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference at 6-0, and Redlands and La 
Verne were tied for second at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills women's volleyball team, which struggled to a 
6-28 record last season, might have received a boost with the return of Nancy 
Fortner as coach. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the 1964 and 1968 U.S. Olympic teams, the 45-year-old Fortner 
coached Dominguez Hills from 1973 through 1979, and Loyola Marymount from 1980 
through 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In her first stint at Dominguez Hills, she guided the Toros to fourth place in 
the Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women's Small College Division in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
At Loyola Marymount, Fortner guided her 1986 team to the Western Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. title and the second round of the NCAA playoffs in only its 
second season in Division I. She posted a record of 144-89 with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"She is one of the most respected volleyball figures in Southern California, by 
virtue of her sterling career as a player and her very successful coaching 
experiences at the collegiate level," said Dan Guerrero, Dominguez Hills 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner replaces Jennifer Gorecki, who resigned last December. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Guard Cathy Gooden and center Niki Bracken of the Cal Poly Pomona women's 
basketball team have been named to the Kodak NCAA Division II All-American team 
selected by the Women's Basketball Coaches Assn. Gooden, a senior who averaged 
16.2 points and 5.5 assists, was picked for the second straight season. 
Bracken, a junior, averaged a team-leading 20 points and 8.7 rebounds as the 
Broncos reached the Division II finals for the sixth time in the eight years of 
the tournament. . . . Forward Donna Pollema of Biola received honorable mention 
on the NAIA All-American women's basketball team. The 6-2 sophomore averaged 
19.7 points and scored 41 in a game against Cal Lutheran in February. 
</P>
<P>
Under first-year coach Janis Ruetz, the Cal State Dominguez Hills women's 
softball team is off to one of its best starts at 19-11-1. The Toros finished 
with a 25-37 record last year. Dominguez Hills has been led by senior pitcher 
Denise Biller, who is 10-4 with a 0.48 ERA. . . . Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
finished in the top five for the eighth straight year with its third-place 
showing at the NCAA Division III men's swimming tournament in Brunswick, Me., 
last week. . . . Baseball Coach Carroll Land of Point Loma Nazarene recorded 
his 500th victory with his team's 4-3 decision over Biola last week.

ESTRADA STOPS POLL IN 10TH, RETAINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Jesus Poll insisted he was all right. That's the message he sent to his corner. 
That's the message he gave referee Lou Moret. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, he couldn't get the message through to his legs. 
</P>
<P>
They deserted twice him in the 10th round of Tuesday night's World Boxing Assn. 
12-round junior featherweight title fight at the Forum before a crowd of 4,861. 
The first time, a pair of solid lefts from champion Juan Jose Estrada of 
Tijuana caused Poll to wobble around and eventually collapse in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
Poll got up, but never back in the fight. An Estrada combination started the 
wobbling anew. Again Poll went down. Poll got up, but Moret signaled the fight 
was over at the 1:38 mark of the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Although the previously unbeaten Poll (19-1-2) was favored, Estrada fought true 
to form. He is 35-7 with 30 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, 122, having already knocked Poll, 121 3/4, down in the third round, 
was ahead on the scorecards of all three judges when the fight was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Poll, a native Venezuelan who moved to North Hollywood to fight for the Ten 
Goose Boxing Club, chose to match punches with the stronger Estrada for much of 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"My real plan was to box," Poll said through an interpreter, "but I felt I had 
him hurt several times, so I went after him." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada earned $40,000 for the fight, Poll $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
One of the preliminary fights featured a scene straight out of Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
Ysaias Zamudio (14-2) of Blythe won the WBA America's flyweight title with a 
third-round knockout of Jose Manuel Diaz (24-17) of Mexicali in a scheduled 
12-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in that round, Zamudio knocked down Diaz with a combination. But as 
Diaz fell, he butted heads with Zamudio, sending him down as well. For several 
seconds, it looked as if Zamudio was going to be the one to stay down. But he 
finally staggered to his feet to finish off Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
In another preliminary, former Olympian Kelcie Banks of Gulfport, Miss., won a 
unanimous decision over Daniel Flores (8-5-1) of Mexicali in a six-round 
lightweight bout. Banks was making his pro debut.

AILING FEDERATED SHUTS 15 STORES, WILL TRIM 400 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federated Group, a troubled consumer electronics chain, on Tuesday disclosed 
that it was closing 15 of its 60 stores, including one in Southern California, 
and slashing 400 jobs from its payroll. The company also said it had installed 
a new group of senior executives in a bid to turn around its business. 
</P>
<P>
The moves came one month after Federated's parent, Atari Corp., announced that 
it wanted to sell the retail chain, which lost $124 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Federated on Tuesday shut down eight stores in California, four in Arizona and 
three in Texas, where it also closed a regional headquarters and warehouse. 
Employees weren't informed until they arrived at work and found the operations 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
The California store closures, which accounted for about 180 to 200 of the 
layoffs, were in the San Gabriel Valley community of La Puente along with 
Fresno, Modesto, Stockton, Sacramento, San Jose, Pinole and Colma. Federated 
also closed stores in Ft. Worth, El Paso, San Antonio, Phoenix and Tuscon. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of drastic reduction is very aggressive. It is very unfortunate. It 
is a very difficult situation," said James D. Fisher, Federated's newly 
announced vice president of marketing. "We've just had this history of poor 
performance, therefore it takes some drastic action to correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher added that the company plans to "refocus our resources on the larger key 
markets" where Federated has been more successful. Atari said it owns the real 
estate at four or five of the closed stores and may sell the sites. 
</P>
<P>
Federated said it now will concentrate on the Southern California market, where 
it has 21 stores, along with Sacramento, Dallas and Houston. The company's 
headquarters will continue to be in Sunnyvale, Calif., and a regional office 
and warehouse will remain in the City of Commerce, where the 19-year-old 
company was based until it was acquired by Atari in 1987 for $67.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers have long held that Federated, once a leader among the 
Southern California consumer electronics chains, had become less competitive 
because of its narrow product mix largely consisting of videocassette 
recorders, televisions and home and car stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Other discount retailers, chief among them Circuit City, have moved 
aggressively into the market with a broad mix of products, including home 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said Federated would continue its competitive pricing strategy but that 
it is looking at some new product categories, including home office equipment, 
home appliances and gifts. The idea, he said, is to make more effective use of 
store space. 
</P>
<P>
The future ownership of the chain remains unclear. Gregory A. Pratt, chief 
financial officer at Atari, said he understood "that there is an interest" 
among the newly named top executives in acquiring the chain. On that point, 
however, Fisher would say only that "our roup is very interested in leading 
Federated to become a leading factor in the consumer electronics field. We are 
taking aggressive action to return Federated to sound basic retailing 
techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Federated's new management team will continue to be headed by Jack Tramiel, who 
is president of the chain and chairman and chief executive of Atari. The 
company's new strategy, however, was devised by a new cadre of vice presidents, 
including Fisher, who has 13 years of consumer electronics experience in 
marketing and promotions. The group also includes Lew Brown, vice president of 
merchandising, who previously worked for Good Guys and Pacific Stereo and was a 
founding partner of Home Express, a chain of home accessory stores; Bill 
Turner, vice president of store operations, who was with Bullocks'/Bullocks 
Wilshire for 15 years; and Howard Cohn, vice president of finance, a 20-year 
veteran of the consumer electronics industry.

JAMES FLANIGAN: LOCKHEED HAS POWERFUL NEW WEAPON: ESOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keep it in the family. Lockheed moved to avoid takeover Tuesday by putting $500 
million worth of its stock into an employee stock ownership plan. That is, the 
big aerospace company is giving employees 17% of its stock so it can't be 
bought by predatory investors on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
There are two trends evident in Lockheed's restructuring. One is the forming of 
a merger wave, with aerospace-defense companies being forced to avoid takeovers 
the way other industries from airlines to supermarkets have had to do. 
</P>
<P>
The other trend is use of the employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, to deter 
investors a company's management deems unwelcome. Polaroid recently used its 
ESOP to foil a buyout bid from Shamrock Holdings, and on Tuesday, Tribune Co., 
owner of the Chicago Tribune, used its ESOP to buy stock and blunt the advance 
of investor Robert M. Bass, who has purchased an interest in Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer Lockheed was trying to avoid is Harold C. Simmons, a highly 
successful investor who has built a $2-billion (revenues) conglomerate called 
Valhi Inc. by takeovers and investment gains. Simmons announced Monday that he 
had acquired 5.3% of Lockheed's stock. The company wasn't thrilled and launched 
a restructuring -- which includes sales of real estate and a subsidiary, plus a 
planned share repurchase -- as a defense against Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, and I'm considering selling some or all of my stock," 
Simmons said Tuesday. In the past, Simmons has responded to management 
defensive tactics by redoubling his takeover efforts. But he seemed to be 
letting Lockheed go, with a swipe at the ESOP idea -- "If they're giving stock 
to the employees, that's obviously not good for the public shareholders" -- and 
the explanation that he'd bought into Lockheed in anticipation of consolidation 
and mergers in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tighter Competition 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of it," Simmons said. "It's a combination of value (in Lockheed's 
stock price) and consolidation. I think General Dynamics is attractive, and 
Rockwell and Raytheon, just to name three other companies." 
</P>
<P>
There are too many companies for too little business in aerospace these days, 
and the prospect is for years of shrinkage in defense budgets. In military 
aircraft, for example, the thinking among analysts is that seven plane makers 
will consolidate to four; that Grumman, Northrop and Rockwell may drop out of 
plane making, leaving the field to Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and 
General Dynamics. In a shrinking industry, some companies would become 
subcontractors, others would merge out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of outlook that excites market speculators but could prove risky 
for ordinary investors. It's always chancy betting on takeovers -- as witness 
Lockheed stock. It was selling at $46.75 on Monday when the news broke that 
Simmons had a 5.3% stake, and speculators, anticipating a takeover fight, sent 
it up $3 a share to $49.75. But on Tuesday, when the company announced its 
restructuring, speculators realized there would be no takeover and showed their 
disappointment by dropping Lockheed $2 a share to $47.75. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary investors don't need such gyrations, but they still can win if they 
buy on the fundamentals. In Lockheed's case, they're not bad. The stock price 
is low -- six times 1988 earnings -- because Lockheed's profits are expected to 
decline in 1989, according to analyst Suzanne Patrick of Sanford C. Bernstein 
&amp; Co., a research firm. The C-5B transport program is phasing out and 
expenses continue for Lockheed's entry in the advanced tactical fighter 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
But profits are expected to rise again in 1990. Meanwhile, Lockheed's mainstay, 
the Trident missile program is not threatened by defense budget cutbacks, and 
the company, in the words of one defense analyst, is "a treasure house of 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but is Harold Simmons right? Does an ESOP benefit employees at the expense 
of public shareholders? No. The theory behind ESOPs -- stock ownership plans 
devised in the 1930s by investment banker Louis Kelso -- is that they benefit 
the business by increasing employee commitment to the firm. The practice of 
ESOPs has been criticized over the years, however. One objection is that ESOPs 
may not be good for employees because they concentrate too many eggs -- job, 
salary and retirement savings -- in one basket. (In Lockheed's case, there is 
no such danger, as the ESOP is supplementary to a pension plan.) Also, the ESOP 
has been misused as a device for protecting management's power and 
prerogatives. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the new use of the ESOP, to defend against takeovers, seems a direct 
extension of the original purpose. For, certainly, people who work for the 
company have more at stake in its long-term survival and stability than do most 
acquirers. In a world of quick-buck artists and bust-up takeovers, can it be 
bad for business to place ownership with people who have a real stake in the 
company? Some trends are healthy.

SIMMONS RESURFACES AFTER 'DIGESTING' HIS LAST TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even after a two-year lull in his raiding game, Harold C. Simmons has 
demonstrated that he can still put fear into the management of potential 
takeover targets. When the self-made Dallas billionaire passed the 5% level in 
his Lockheed holdings, it apparently hit a nerve. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lockheed quickly threw up more of the defenses that it began 
erecting against him last December, when he disclosed that he might increase 
his 0.6% stake in the big aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet-spoken Simmons is no one to take lightly, having shown his tough 
style in a series of uninvited acquisitions that started in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1986, the 57-year-old said Tuesday he had been "digesting" his 
last major acquisition, NL Industries, -- a New York chemicals firm. Until this 
week, that is. 
</P>
<P>
After disclosing his $150-million Lockheed stake Monday, Simmons also said he 
has bought lesser but substantial interests in three other major corporations: 
Chrysler, Paccar and Phelps Dodge. The vehicle for his acquisitions is Valhi 
Inc., the Dallas holding company of which he owns 88%. 
</P>
<P>
The news set off shock waves on Wall Street, along with speculation about 
which, if any of the companies, he might have grand designs upon. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his 24-acre Santa Barbara villa (one of several 
residences he owns), Simmons certainly was not tipping his hand. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was "disappointed" that Lockheed unveiled a $500-million employee 
stock ownership plan -- which he called a dilution of stockholder value -- as a 
takeover defense. He said he was evaluating that, plus the company's new 
forecast of slower earnings, adding that he "might sell some" of his Lockheed 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, one of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank's past clients in 
the "junk bond" business, declined to be drawn out on his intentions about 
Lockheed or the other three firms. In each case, he said, he has sought federal 
antitrust clearance to buy more than $15 million worth of stock -- "all good, 
sound investments." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons accounted for the lull of the last two years by saying: "You got to 
digest what you've got." He added that he had to "accomplish some objectives" 
and get "some cash" before taking on something new. 
</P>
<P>
Would he make a major acquisition in the near future? 
</P>
<P>
"You never know," he drawled without a trace of jocularity. "The world changes 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
Is Simmons hard to read? 
</P>
<P>
"He is very difficult to read. By design, it is very hard to read Harold's 
M.O.," a friend, Los Angeles financier Burt Sugarman, said Tuesday. "That's 
what he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons just might be "the brightest investor in the country," said Sugarman, 
50, a former Hollywood television producer who turned to investing a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
As for Simmons' low profile recently, Sugarman said: "I don't think he ever 
lies low. I think he works all the time. Sometimes things just don't surface 
publicly. He is a total nonstop thinker." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons earned a master's degree in economics and a Phi Beta Kappa key at the 
University of Texas, where he also played varsity basketball. An aide said 
Tuesday that Simmons "still has the same build," adding: "There is not an ounce 
of extra fat on him." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons tries to run his business the same way. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not object to being called a corporate raider as long as that 
is understood as someone who "takes uninvited stock positions." But he said 
dislikes any implication of "some kind of force." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons started as a federal bank examiner, then became a bank executive before 
launching what grew into a chain of 100 drugstores, selling out in 1973. 
Meanwhile, he invested in insurance companies before starting his takeover 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, Simmons tried to take over PSA, the San Diego-based airline 
holding company, but settled for a good profit on his investment, as he has 
since done with a number of investments, including Sea-Land Corp. in 1985. 
Besides NL, he succeeded in acquiring Amalgamated Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons has had a couple of brushes with government agencies. In 1974, a judge 
found him and five co-defendants innocent of securities fraud stemming from the 
failure of an insurance firm. However, he paid $500,000 to settle civil charges 
out of court in what he recently called "the low point in my career." 
</P>
<P>
And in 1984, the Labor Department sued Simmons for using assets of pension 
plans under his control to finance takeover bids for Amalgamated Sugar.

LOCKHEED SETS STOCK PLAN FOR WORKERS, WILL SHED 4 UNITS AND LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After being a potential takeover target for years because its shares are 
considered undervalued, Lockheed unveiled a corporate overhaul Tuesday that 
includes an employee stock ownership plan, sale of some Burbank real estate, 
disposal of smaller operations and a dividend increase. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellup disclosed that the 
Calabasas-based aerospace firm is holding discussions with McDonnell Douglas on 
a potential subcontracting deal to assemble stretched MD-11 jetliners and with 
Netherlands-based Fokker for the assembly of F-100 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
The major restructuring, which is intended to improve the value of Lockheed 
shares and reinforce defenses against corporate raiders, came one day after 
Texas investor Harold C. Simmons disclosed that he owns 5.3% of Lockheed's 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tellup said the restructuring has been in the works since last fall and that 
the announcement of the plan Tuesday was only coincidental to Simmons' 
disclosure Monday. Tellup said he does not regard Simmons' $150-million 
investment in Lockheed as the start of a hostile takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the actions had the overarching objective of increasing shareholder 
value and positioning Lockheed for long-term growth," Tellup said at a news 
conference Tuesday morning in Calabasas. "Nothing we do can prevent a fair 
value offer (by a corporate raider)." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons reacted negatively to the restructuring effort, saying: "I'm 
disappointed. I hadn't expected them to react like this to my investment. It's 
not good value for the shareholders. I'm considering selling some or all of my 
stock. I made an investment based on the outlook for the company and the 
aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed shares gave up $2 in New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, closing 
at $47.75. On Monday, they had gained $3 on news of Simmons' investment in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed also disclosed Tuesday that it expects that its 1989 earnings from 
continuing operations will decline by 25% from the $442 million reported in 
1988. The decline is attributable to completion of the C-5B cargo jet program, 
high tax rates and cost increases in some other military programs, the company 
said. But profits should grow in 1990 and beyond, Tellup said. 
</P>
<P>
Under its complicated restructuring plan, Lockheed created an employee stock 
ownership plan that acquired about 10.5 million shares of newly issued Lockheed 
stock for $500 million. The ESOP borrowed the money to pay Lockheed for the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lockheed has started buying back 10.5 million shares of its 
stock on the open market, thereby eliminating any dilutive effect that the 
newly issued stock would have on existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tellup said the ESOP, whose participants will be salaried employees, is 
expected to "get employees more involved and productive" and secondarily may be 
a takeover defense. After the ESOP is in place and all the outstanding shares 
are repurchased, Lockheed employees will own about 17% of the company's stock, 
a voting bloc that could help thwart a hostile takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
The company also disclosed that it will accelerate by one year the plans it 
disclosed in 1988 to move virtually all manufacturing, parts fabrication and 
engineering activities out of Burbank to newer facilities in Palmdale, Rye 
Canyon and Marietta, Ga. The move will be completed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 employees will move to new job locations, leaving about 7,000 
behind in Burbank. The move may result in some layoffs, but no more than 300, 
Tellup said. 
</P>
<P>
After vacating the aged Burbank facilities, some of which were constructed 
during World War II, Lockheed will sell about 225 acres of valuable land 
adjacent to the Burbank airport. Tellup said the company does not have an 
estimate of the value of the land, but commercial land brokers have said the 
land is worth more than $1.5 million per acre, indicating that the 225 acres 
might be worth more than $337 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company will keep the headquarters of its Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. 
in Burbank, where Lockheed has been building aircraft since 1928 when founder 
Allan Loughead moved his small airplane company into a former china factory 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Tellup said he hoped that the move of 7,000 employees, mainly to Rye Canyon 
near Valencia and Palmdale, will be accomplished with a minimum of disruption. 
Company surveys have indicated that many workers will not have to move from 
their present homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another element of Lockheed's restructuring is a plan to sell the parts of its 
information systems group, including CalComp of Anaheim, CADAM of Burbank, 
Metier of Burbank and Lockheed Dataplan of Los Gatos. The four companies had 
1988 revenue of $589 million. They are believed to be more profitable than many 
of Lockheed's weapons contracts, but Tellup said the company wants to focus on 
its primary businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed will also form a new anti-submarine warfare office in Washington in an 
effort to win contracts in that growing Navy market. Lockheed is building the 
Navy's Long Range Air Antisubmarine Capable Aircraft, which has recently been 
renamed the P-7. 
</P>
<P>
In a final reorganization move, Lockheed will create a new technology services 
group to consolidate such operations as space shuttle processing, engineering 
sciences, data processing, and aircraft and airport facilities modernization 
and maintenance. The group will have $1 billion in revenue and is expected to 
build up "entrepreneurially," Tellup said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas spokesman Don Hanson confirmed that talks with Lockheed have 
been conducted, but he said they are "preliminary." He said the discussions 
involve final assembly of a stretched version of Douglas' new MD-11 wide-bodied 
jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no decision on what would be the fate of future MD-11 assembly and 
there won't be any soon," Hanson said. "There is not that much hurry about 
getting that decided." 
</P>
<P>
The first MD-11 is expected to begin test flying in May and to enter commercial 
service next year.

FORTUNE 500 POST RECORD PROFITS FOR 1988;

America's largest manufacturers enjoyed their most prosperous year in recent 
history during 1988 as continued economic growth brought record profits and 
soaring sales, Fortune magazine said Tuesday in its latest ranking of the 500 
biggest U.S. industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
"As the U.S. economy expanded for the sixth straight year, demand continued to 
surge and factories and refineries operated near capacity," Fortune said in its 
April 24 issue, available on newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune 500 sales topped $2 trillion for the first time, while total profits 
for the group jumped 27% to a record $115 billion in 1988, the magazine stated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ford Bumps Exxon for No. 2 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers had especially strong revenue last year, with General 
Motors Corp. again topping the Fortune 500 and Ford Motor Co. bumping Exxon 
Corp. from the No. 2 spot. Chrysler Corp. jumped to No. 7 from No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Companies involved in acquisitions also moved higher. Philip Morris Cos. took 
the No. 10 spot, up from 12th last year, partly because of its acquisition of 
Kraft Corp., ranked 31st in 1987. Eastman Kodak Co. jumped to No. 18 from No. 
25 with the acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc., ranked 174 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine began publishing the elite annual directory in 1955, ranking 
companies in terms of annual sales. It also publishes a list later in the year 
of the top 500 U.S. service companies. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 after GM and Ford were: Exxon, International Business Machines 
Corp., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp., Chrysler, Texaco Inc., Du Pont and 
Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., ranked eighth in the 1987 listing, was 
bumped from the 1988 list because most of its revenue was generated from the 
service sector. ITT Corp., ranked No. 45 in 1987, also fell into that category. 
The highest-ranking newcomer to the 500 list was Unilever U.S., owned by the 
British-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever, which debuted at No. 63. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double-Digit Profit Growth 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said nearly all of the 27 industrial categories contained in its 
list had double-digit earnings growth in 1988, led by metal companies, which 
showed a 100% jump, boosted by soaring copper prices and the steel industry's 
successful restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune attributed some of the profit increases to accounting changes requiring 
companies to consolidate results of their majority-owned subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Large oil refiners posted a 63% increase in profits, benefiting from what 
Fortune called "a double dose of luck; OPEC squabbling drove crude oil prices 
down, lowering costs, while demand strengthened, increasing prices." 
</P>
<P>
No. 31 Phillips Petroleum Co. profited most by those circumstances as earnings 
jumped 18-fold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Groups Decline 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil Corp., ranked No. 201, was the biggest profit gainer among the 500, 
with a 30-fold rise in earnings. But the company owed most of that bounty to an 
extraordinary gain from its celebrated $3-billion lawsuit settlement with 
Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna (M. A.) Co., a chemicals and energy concern, had the biggest increase in 
sales, a 122% jump. 
</P>
<P>
The only two industry groups with declining profits in 1988 were apparel 
companies, which suffered a 3% drop, and building materials concerns, which 
lost 18% as housing starts declined for the second straight year in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
No. 460 Maxus Energy Corp. had the biggest drop in sales, a 53% decline. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, New York is home to the greatest number of Fortune 500 
companies -- 48, down from 51 the previous year. Chicago was again No. 2 with 
22, down from 24 the year before, and Dallas was No. 3 with 15, up from 12. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top 10 were: Houston, 13, up from 12; Pittsburgh, 12, down from 
15; Cleveland, 11, down from 12; Los Angeles, Atlanta and Minneapolis tied for 
seventh with 10 each, and St. Louis and Stamford, Conn., tied for ninth with 9, 
down from 10 last year.

C&amp;S SET TO BATTLE NCNB TAKEOVER

Two Southeastern banking giants are girding for a long battle as North 
Carolina-based NCNB Corp. stands by its $2.4-billion hostile takeover bid for 
Georgia-based Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens, a $21-billion bank holding company based in Atlanta, has rejected the 
NCNB bid and invoked Georgia's anti-takeover law. It has also hired an array of 
legal experts and financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB, the $50-billion banking behemoth of the 
growing Southeast region, has reiterated its intention to carry out a deal that 
would be among the biggest mergers in American banking history and create the 
nation's sixth largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
NCNB operates in seven Southern states and manages assets of more than $50 
billion. Its own assets totaled $29.85 billion at the end of 1988, but it also 
manages $25.6 billion in assets that belonged to Dallas-based First 
RepublicBank, of which it bought a 20% interest last summer and renamed NCNB 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens' spokesman Scott Screedon, said Georgia regulators would likely oppose 
the proposed takeover "because of the possibility that Georgia assets may be 
expected to be shifted to Texas" to help NCNB fulfill its commitment to revive 
First RepublicBank.

SURF WEAR FIRM HOPES TO APPEAL TO THE MASSES; 
</P>
<P>
CATCHIT RIDES BIG WAVE TO THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catchit -- once one of the hippest surf wear companies on the West Coast -- has 
moved its surf trunks and body shorts to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The move from Tustin to Van Nuys this week was part of a shake-up by Van Nuys 
Surf Co., which became Catchit's sole owner last month when it bought the 50% 
interest of founder and former President Ian Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
Now Van Nuys Surf Co. hopes to revive sales by selling Catchit's surf trunks 
and board shorts to more than just surfers. The company hopes to market its 
merchandise through Mervyn's and J. C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have our clothing on the masses, as opposed to the few," said Mitch 
Fine, president. "Catchit itself has a big name . . . and we want to 
merchandise to as many folks as we can." 
</P>
<P>
While Fine and his partner, Bill Snyder, have not yet signed agreements with 
Mervyn's and Penney's, Fine said both have been contacted and "they're 
receptive to seeing us." 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Catchit -- whose worth was estimated by industry sources at $1 
million -- is the latest sign of a shakeout in the $1-billion surf wear 
industry. Since late 1987, several one-time industry leaders have experienced 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Catchit was founded eight years ago by Foreman. A native of South Africa and a 
former distributor of rival Gotcha, Foreman was a self-described "one-man 
band," who began by manufacturing a line of five stretch trunks, two walk 
shorts and a T-shirt out of his beach house. 
</P>
<P>
From an investment of $5,000, Foreman's sales hit $250,000 in his first season. 
Over the next seven years, the company expanded into sportswear for boys and 
toddlers and created a juniors line. Later, it added SK8 (pronounced "skate") 
and Skatehardware to appeal to a new group of customers who ride skateboards 
instead of waves. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times in early 1987, Foreman predicted sales that year 
of $20 million. But at the same time, Catchit -- along with 300 to 400 
competitors -- began struggling in a surf market that was no longer laid back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that Catchit's business had been off considerably before this 
time," said Steve MacBaisey, president of Cycle Industries, Catchit's T-shirt 
licensee. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman said he left Catchit because he got a good offer. "The timing, the 
price, the conditions -- everything was right," he said. "Sometimes the 
best-laid plans of men and mice change. . . . It was time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Darrin Donaho, a Catchit salesman, said the split came because "Ian wanted to 
stay real hard-core surf and it's past our time. It's time to go to the 
department stores." 
</P>
<P>
That time may have come because Catchit had wiped out in trendy surf shops. 
</P>
<P>
"Catchit ran its course about 3 years ago. It's bad news," said Tom Noble, 
manager of Newport Surf and Sport in Newport Beach. "Most retailers like us 
wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole."

IMF STOPS SHORT OF ENDORSING U.S. DEBT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday called interest-rate cuts, low 
inflation and open markets vital for the economic health of the industrial and 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
"A reduction in world interest rates and a more open trading system . . . 
remain of vital importance," the fund's policy-making Interim Committee said in 
a communique. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which polices the world economy, also welcomed a new U.S. plan to help 
out debt-ridden developing countries, but stopped short of endorsing it fully. 
Worried about the future of democracy in the debt-ridden nations of Latin 
America, Washington has put forward a radical plan to slash the debt and 
interest rate burden of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
While supporting the importance of debt reduction, the committee decided to 
study certain key aspects of the U.S. proposal further after some of its 
members expressed fears the plan could lead to a government bailout of 
commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said major nations could also help ease the debt crisis by 
resisting protectionism and working hard to put their economies into better 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Early action to reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit is essential as well as 
steps to improve the . . . (trade) position of the United States without 
pushing up interest rates," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Third World debtors reckon they will have to ante up an extra $10 billion in 
interest payments per year as a result of the rise in interest rates since last 
summer. Interest rates have risen as the United States and other major nations 
have fought to contain inflationary pressures sparked by stronger-than-expected 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee agreed that it was essential to deal promptly and effectively 
with emerging price pressures in order to ensure the sustainability of the 
current expansion," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
But IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus acknowledged that there were some 
differences in the committee about how best to help ease the Third World's 
crippling debt. 
</P>
<P>
However, he downplayed their importance, saying that everyone agreed on the 
broad thrust of the strategy to cut the debt burden but just differed over the 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
The major sticking point is a U.S. proposal to help Third World debtors meet 
their interest bills by using funds from the IMF and the World Bank to 
effectively guarantee payment. 
</P>
<P>
Most European countries have voiced concern that creditor governments would end 
up picking up the tab for interest payments due to commercial banks, something 
the IMF has resolutely opposed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee tried to get around the differences on Monday by agreeing 
to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said the IMF itself should decide by the end of the year whether 
it needs more money to carry out its enhanced role in the new strategy to 
tackle Third World debt.

PURCHASERS OF MONDAVI FUTURES FACE WINDFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Paul Masson, the 19th-Century California wine pioneer, vowed that he 
would "sell no wine before its time," Robert Mondavi, his 20th-Century 
counterpart, did just the opposite two years ago by selling some of his best 
wines before their time. 
</P>
<P>
And next month, Mondavi said Tuesday, the investors who bought their wine early 
through his innovative wine futures program will reap a rich payoff. 
</P>
<P>
The futures buyers -- mostly wine distributors but also wine merchants and 
collectors -- bought the wines at a price that works out to $22.50 a bottle at 
retail for 1985 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon reserve and $19 for the 1986 
vintage. But now, Mondavi said, current demand for the soon-to-be-released 
wines has boosted the retail value to about $40 and $35, respectively, an 
appreciation of 78% and 84% on the two-year investments. 
</P>
<P>
When offered in March, 1987, buyers reportedly had anticipated appreciation of 
about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mondavi said he was pleased with the futures program's first 
offerings and is selling his 1988 vintage for delivery in 1991. He also said he 
is considering adding a Pinot Noir to the program. 
</P>
<P>
Mondavi said he decided to offer a wine futures program, similar to those 
offered by some of the great wine estates in Bordeaux, France, to demonstrate 
that Napa Valley's best could hold their own in the marketplace. "Our wines 
belong in the company of the great wines of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One inducement for buying wine futures is to assure supplies of the limited 
quantities available. Futures buyers receive their wine about six months before 
it is released commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Mondavi said that in the 22 years since he established the Robert Mondavi 
Winery in Oakville, he has "come full circle" in his concept of wine making. 
Now, he said, he strives to grow grapes organically and to leave the resulting 
wines unfiltered to avoid stripping away taste elements -- in a way, reducing 
the influence of modern technology in search of a wine imbued with "a 
gentleness" when young while retaining the ability to improve with age.

A wealthy art collector can avoid jail if she does not contact a financial 
adviser she allegedly telephoned 1,200 times in one week after the 1987 stock 
market crash, according to the terms of her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Scull, 67, was fined $1,000 and given a conditional discharge of a 
one-year jail sentence after she pleaded guilty Monday to aggravated harassment 
of her stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
Scull was accused of making 1,208 telephone calls in one week in January, 1988, 
to Charles Lewis, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., because she 
blamed him for financial losses in the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash. Prosecutors 
claimed that she called him 485 times in one day. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Renee White, who accepted Scull's plea, also 
assessed her $60 in court costs and ordered her not to call, write or go near 
Lewis for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Scull was arrested on the harassment charges Feb. 1. She failed to keep a court 
date Feb. 28, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Scull is an avid art collector whose collection include works from artists 
Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol.

MARCH CAR SALES FALL 12% AS INTEREST RATES TAKE TOLL

Sales of new imported and domestic cars fell 12% in March from a year ago, the 
auto industry reported Tuesday, as consumers seemed frightened away from 
showrooms by rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Weak sales in February and earlier in March had already prompted the Big Three 
to offer low interest rates on new car loans as well as other sales incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Auto analysts are divided over whether the newest incentive programs will be 
effective. They say that the next 10 to 20 days will test whether the 
incentives can work. 
</P>
<P>
"We know sales have been lousy all this year," said Christopher Cedergren, an 
automotive analyst with J. D. Power &amp; Associates. "If there isn't a marked 
improvement in April, there will be much greater concern. Manufacturers are 
going to have to sweeten the deal." 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't see a pickup in 20-30 days, the industry has a serious problem," 
agreed Thomas F. O'Grady, an automotive analyst with Integrated Automotive 
Resources, a market research firm. "We're going to have to see some sharp 
cutbacks in production." 
</P>
<P>
The total auto industry sold 882,631 units in March, compared to 1,002,638 in 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Both import and domestic sales were disappointing this month. Domestically 
produced automobiles fell 12.8%, while imports fell 9.6%.

EASTERN'S FATE WON'T HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON AIR TRAVEL AS MARKET ADJUSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the short term, the Eastern Airlines strike has spelled crowded planes, 
complex travel schedules and a shortage of discount fares for passengers headed 
for Caribbean cruises and Florida vacations. And those who paid for tickets for 
canceled Eastern flights generally got nothing for their money. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, whether Eastern survives or dies, airline service will return 
to normal. Eastern's grounded aircraft inevitably will be back in the air, 
carrying the banner of a revived Eastern or sold to a competitor if Eastern 
dies. The streamlined airline industry, analysts agree, will tailor its flights 
to meet the public's demand. 
</P>
<P>
"If Eastern never flew again," analyst Edmund S. Greenslet said, its landing 
slots and planes would be quickly sold, and within six months "the public would 
not know that Eastern had ever existed." 
</P>
<P>
But they might wish it still did. As Delta, American and Pan American World 
Airways grow richer and bigger on the busy routes they now share with Eastern, 
price competition might suffer. Without Eastern, which carried nearly 7% of the 
nation's air traffic last year, other airlines would probably cut back on the 
discount fares they have been using to woo passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The torrent of speculation about possible buyers for all or part of Eastern's 
operations is testimony to the lure of its lucrative markets. 
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters of last year, Eastern enjoyed big shares of the 
total air traffic on some heavily traveled routes: New York to Miami, 53%; 
Boston to Washington, 52%; New York to Boston, 33%; New York to Washington, 
32%, and New York to Orlando, Fla., 28%, according to a study prepared for The 
Times by Yield Data Services of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Airlines Benefit 
</P>
<P>
Since the strike began March 4, Eastern has been able to fly only 10% of its 
normal daily schedule of 1,040 flights. Each passing week lengthens the odds 
against Eastern, which declared bankruptcy March 9, returning to full operation 
under its current ownership. Other carriers are moving into the vacuum left by 
Eastern's grounded planes and solidifying their expanded market shares. 
</P>
<P>
Delta, which uses Atlanta as a hub for many of its flights, is a big winner 
because Eastern also uses Atlanta as a hub. In Boston, Delta and USAir are 
carrying more passengers. Piedmont is making gains in the cities served by the 
Charlotte, N.C., hub, another important airport for Eastern. Pan Am's shuttles 
from New York to Boston and Washington got a major boost. Trans World has been 
helped on routes between the Northeast and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, these airlines lack spare planes and personnel to throw into the 
breach during the Eastern strike. Instead, their regular flights are more 
crowded. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government is not worried about the possible demise of Eastern. 
"There has not been a major disruption for business or recreational travel," 
said Bob Marx, spokesman for the Department of Transportation. "Other carriers 
have been able to fill the gap. We want to keep hands off." 
</P>
<P>
Domestic routes are almost totally unregulated. With four exceptions, any 
airline can fly to any airport. "It happens almost daily," Marx noted. "You 
pick up the newspaper and see an ad announcing that a carrier will begin 
service to XYZ cities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Back Expansion 
</P>
<P>
The exceptions are four of the nation's most crowded airports: O'Hare in 
Chicago, National in Washington, and LaGuardia and Kennedy in New York. For 
safety reasons, only a limited number of landing slots are available there, and 
if Eastern goes under, its competitors will have to bid for its landing rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although access to markets is free and easy, other carriers hesitate to make 
permanent commitments to expand until they know whether Eastern will recover. 
"Why rip up the current route system to put extra capacity into unsettled 
Eastern markets," said Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst with Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
This prudence has been bad news for those who were caught holding tickets on 
Eastern when the strike began. "Some people who had been booked on Eastern were 
left stranded," noted Helane Becker, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
"After initial juggling around, other airlines will move to fill the void that 
is left." 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers "are frustrated because they can't get on the exact flight they 
want," said Jim Brown, a spokesman for American Airlines, which has added a few 
flights from New York to Puerto Rico since Eastern's machinists walked out 
March 4. "We don't have the crews and aircraft standing by, and we will not 
defer scheduled maintenance to accommodate extra flights." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, however, has been able to expand service significantly in a special 
market, the heavily traveled shuttle corridors between Washington, New York and 
Boston. They are veritable highways for business executives, government 
officials, professors and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"The shuttle is an accordion, able to expand and contract according to demand," 
said Jeff Kriendler, vice president for corporate affairs at Pan Am. The 
airline's normal shuttle tally is 64 flights daily. Since the Eastern strike 
began, Pan Am has added as many as 30 extra flights. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish that, Pan Am has added just one extra plane, a big A-300 airbus. 
The additional demand is being met by reducing the turnaround time on the 
ground for aircraft and by having pilots fly extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are remarkably normal considering that volume has doubled," Kriendler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Eastern Has Had It' 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am carried 27,000 people during one frenzied weekend period shortly after 
the strike began, charging $99 for the Friday flight and $69 on Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Business executives are flying Pan Am at $99 rather than the Eastern shuttle 
at $49 because of certainty and reliability," said Nicholas Glaskowsky, 
professor of management and transportation at the University of Miami in Coral 
Gables. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern as a major carrier has had it, " he said. "They will never be able to 
come back to what they were." 
</P>
<P>
Airline customers do not have strong brand affections. "The only loyalty is to 
get where you want to go when you want to go," said Greenslet, the head of ESG 
Aviation Services, which publishes a monthly review of airline finances and 
traffic. "Other companies will pick up Eastern's business, and the customer in 
the end won't notice the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern suffered operating losses of $83 million in last year's fourth quarter, 
and its long-range chances of survival seem slim even if the strike is settled. 
In sharp contrast, its rivals are fat with cash and eager to make their 
temporary market gains permanent. American had a profit of $181 million in the 
final quarter, Delta amassed $119 million and United earned $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
These carriers have billions of dollars worth of new, fuel-efficient aircraft 
scheduled for delivery to their fleets in the next few years. "The rich got 
richer," Edward Starkman of the Paine Webber financial firm said in a recent 
report. 
</P>
<P>
During the current period of uncertainty, while Eastern's fate remains 
unsettled and long before new aircraft can be committed to Eastern's routes by 
its competitors, consumers will pay more to fly. 
</P>
<P>
The rivals of Eastern, afraid of a public relations backlash, are not raising 
their regular fares. Instead, they are offering fewer discount fares for 
travelers who pay well in advance for nonrefundable tickets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Sell-Outs 
</P>
<P>
Each airline has an elaborate computer program designed to maximize revenue 
through a careful combination of conventional and discount fares. For a 
Wednesday evening flight from New York to Chicago that is normally only 25% 
full, the airline will make ample numbers of discount tickets available. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, all but a relative handful of the 500,000 people who usually fly 
Eastern on a given day are trying to crowd onto other airlines. Their flights 
fill up quickly, making it unnecessary for the airlines to offer large numbers 
of discount tickets. What cheap seats remain sell out in a hurry.

GLAMOUR'S 50TH BIRTHDAY PARTY: IT'S STILL FLYING HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was 50 years ago this month that Glamour magazine (then dubbed Glamour of 
Hollywood) debuted on newsstands, giving the country's females a monthly bible 
of fashion trends and other girly advice. 
</P>
<P>
A half-century later it's still doling out fashion tips, in addition to job 
strategies, relationship advice and bedroom etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night at DC3 (the much-written about Santa Monica Airport restaurant) 
the magazine celebrated its birthday. Guests crowded into the airy marble and 
wood eatery just as the sun was setting. 
</P>
<P>
As they dined on oysters and crudites, a bank of video monitors broadcast 
vintage Glamour covers (which would look retro-hip if done today) and 
interviews with former cover girls like Cybill Shepherd as speakers blasted 
hits from '60s girls groups and current top-40 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Women chatted about how Glamour-isms have pervaded their language and remarked 
how they regularly point out Glamour Do's and Don't's, talk about how to spend 
Private Time and how to solve their Sticky Situations of the Month. Upon 
hearing this, publisher Jack Kliger cried, "Oh my God! We've become an 
institution!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Art Director 
</P>
<P>
Although Kliger wasn't around when the first issue of Glamour hit the stands, 
Charlotte McNamara was. The magazine's first art director was flown from her 
home in Mexico to attend the party. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the time has passed!" she said, and recalled, "We wanted so 
badly to make it stand out on the newsstands. I think it would still stand out 
on the newsstands today." 
</P>
<P>
Added the now-retired McNamara, "They tell me I was the first woman art 
director of a major publication in the United States. But there was a lot of 
prejudice against women in those days. At one point I wanted to work at Gourmet 
magazine because I love to cook, but I was told that they wanted to hire a 
man." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975 a Rutgers co-ed named Sheryl Lee Ralph was named a Top Ten College 
Women winner. Back then, Ralph planned on a career in medicine; today she's an 
actress who has appeared in "The Mighty Quinn" and "Skin Deep." 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Ralph said, "with all my credits, the one thing that always gets 
mentioned is the fact that I was a Glamour Top Ten College Woman. The 
magazine's been very supportive (of my career), at every plateau they've been 
there. How many editors of magazines take the time to drop you a note to wish 
you well?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Food Was a Draw 
</P>
<P>
Others seen drifting back through the restaurant's many rooms were Glamour 
Editor Ruth Whitney (wearing gold "50" earrings), supermodel Beverly Johnson, 
West Coast Editor Daina Hulet, plus various fashion industry reps, models, and 
girls who just looked like models. 
</P>
<P>
The food was a definite draw. Since the restaurant has been written up in 
countless reviews, guests were eager to try out the various dishes: grilled 
swordfish with lemon butter, filet mignon with potatoes and horseradish sauce, 
grilled chicken with herbs, Caesar salad, and a chocolate, vanilla and 
strawberry cake with "50" written in raspberries. 
</P>
<P>
The majority practiced fashion do's in this crowd, which dressed in post-work 
chic. Some women opted for little black suits, accessorized with hats or 
monster cables (known also as the Chanel look), or pant suits. Men wore trim 
suits and "conversation ties," patterned with an interesting design or picture 
that instigate conversations ("Hey, where'd you get this? . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
The one fashion don't stand-out was a man with glitter in his bushy, blow-dried 
hair. Maybe he needed his subscription renewed.

10 YEARS OF C-SPAN COVERAGE -- AND THE HOUSE STILL STANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 19, 1979, when then-Rep. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) stepped up to the podium to 
make the House of Representatives' first live televised speech, opponents 
predicted the practice would lead to disaster. In his speech, Gore countered by 
saying that television would "revitalize representative democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, most analysts and members of Congress agree that neither side 
was right. 
</P>
<P>
Since that day when the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) started 
broadcasting live coverage of the House of Representatives via the rapidly 
expanding cable-TV industry, Washington-area clothiers have joked of a marked 
rise in the sale of bright-red neckties. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond cosmetic changes and some slight accommodations in House rules, the 
consensus is that television in the Congress has not had the dramatic effect 
both sides predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a televised Congress once claimed that cameras would reduce the 
level of debate to "political posturing" for the benefit of the people 
watching. But a leading foe of congressional television at the time, Sen. John 
Danforth (R-Mo.), conceded recently that "the playing to the cameras and the 
galleries that I expected just didn't occur." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, those leading the fight for C-SPAN said the cameras would 
force a new level of representation for members of Congress who would suddenly 
be accountable to the average person in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Robinson, a professor of media and politics at Georgetown 
University, said that because of C-SPAN, "a few more people might show up on 
the floor, (but) the House is not all that different than it was 15 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Even Brian Lamb, the widely acclaimed founder and chief executive officer of 
C-SPAN, now questions whether his network has "changed the world" as some had 
predicted it would. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know and I don't worry about it," he said. "I didn't get into the 
business to change the system. I got into the business to provide people a 
larger picture, more of the story." 
</P>
<P>
C-SPAN's picture has grown larger over the years. Initially covering only the 
House proceedings, the network has now added coverage of the Senate, political 
conventions, congressional hearings, press conferences and call-in talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a constant growth," Lamb said. "That was all in the plan. We had 
to show a lot of different people that there was an audience out there for this 
kind of TV. We evolved a step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that while C-SPAN hasn't wrought major changes in Congress, it has 
had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
For example, analysts say a cluster of House members who call themselves the 
Conservative Opportunity Society, led by Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), successfully 
used C-SPAN to help gain public recognition. By taking advantage of a short 
period at the end of each day's business that allows for speeches on any 
subject, Gingrich and his colleagues were able to rally public support for 
their particular interests. The rule allowing such speeches had been there 
before C-SPAN, but was little used until there were cameras present to 
broadcast the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"Newt Gingrich made it clear from Day 1 that they were going to use C-SPAN to 
tell the people the truth," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Gingrich was elected minority whip, the No. 2 position in the House 
Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of partisanship, almost everyone agrees that the camera's presence 
has shortened speeches on the House floor and has probably made them better. 
</P>
<P>
For Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the presence of the television cameras in the 
Senate has meant "the debate has been better. The speeches have been better." 
</P>
<P>
"There is greater care taken in making sure that what they say is what they 
mean," said Michael Sheehan, a media consultant who frequently advises 
Democrats in Congress on how to take advantage of the television camera. "You 
don't have the ability to edit the tape before it is beamed up to the 
satellite." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Blakely, a Washington media consultant who formerly worked for the 
Republican Party, said C-SPAN "requires members to be articulate and to be able 
to speak in 30- and 60-second sound bites. Woe be it to those who do not come 
across in a telegenic manner." 
</P>
<P>
More changes may evolve. Gore, now a U.S. senator, applauds "the marriage of 
open debate and the television medium" on C-SPAN but adds: "The House and 
Senate still have some work to do in fully adapting to the needs of democracy 
by, for example, scheduling important debates for times when most Americans can 
watch and listen. Eventually, that will occur." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Senate might schedule important debates during prime time 
"maybe a couple nights a week." 
</P>
<P>
By the network's own count, more than 21 million people tune in at least three 
times a month to watch the House on C-SPAN I and close to 17 million do the 
same with the Senate on C-SPAN II. While the numbers remain far below the 
average viewing audience for commercial networks, they represent substantial 
growth for the once-fledgling channels. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a part of the population in America that is fascinated by politics 
and public policy," said Jeff Greenfield, who covers politics and the media for 
ABC News. "They follow C-SPAN the way a sports junkie would follow (the cable 
sports channel) ESPN." 
</P>
<P>
C-SPAN's audience spans the socioeconomic spectrum, Lamb said, but he 
acknowledged that the network appeals most to the politically interested. 
"Newspaper people, bankers, teachers, politicians -- the political 
infrastructure -- watch this network out of proportion with the others in 
society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say television's success in the House and Senate foreshadow 
similar changes in the other branches of government -- most notably the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"As each institution opens up," Sheehan said, "the pressure gets greater to 
open up the deliberations in the Supreme Court." He added that photo 
opportunities at the White House might eventually turn into "video 
opportunities" with C-SPAN broadcasting them live. 
</P>
<P>
For Lamb, however, the primary goal for the next 10 years is "fine-tuning what 
we've already got," including getting it carried by more cable systems and 
persuading more teachers to incorporate it in their curricula. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the network would not necessarily be satisfied with broadcasting 
only American politics. Lamb said he foresees a future where C-SPAN covers the 
political process in other countries as well.

10,000 ANSWER KABC-AM CALL FOR CANCER VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a novel use of the radio airwaves, more than 10,000 people called 
talk-radio station KABC-AM (790) Tuesday morning volunteering to serve as 
subjects for an experimental cancer detection test. 
</P>
<P>
KABC General Manager George Green said he was stunned not only by the size but 
also by the immediacy of the response. "I didn't expect to get that many people 
that quick. . . . We got 5,000 in a half hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts from UCLA's John Wayne Cancer Clinic said they took their 
request for research subjects to the radio because they wanted a large sampling 
of people on whom they could administer their detection procedure. 
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the test is not yet considered definitive. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many aspects of this that we can only really determine from such a 
large sample," said Dr. Donald Morton, who has been working on the procedure 
for 15 years with Dr. Rishab Gupta. 
</P>
<P>
He and other doctors hope that early detection of cancer could provide victims 
with earlier treatment and, ultimately, longer lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal with this test is simple: To be able to detect cancer at its earliest 
stage and at a stage where 90% of people can be cured," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
KABC's Green said the station's day-long focus on cancer Tuesday had been in 
the works for three months, since he first heard about the experiments at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to demonstrate that radio is more than just controversial b.s.," 
Green said. "There's some good that we can do for the community." 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first widespread testing of the detection procedure, which 
isolates antigen -- a chemical found in cancer patients -- in the urine of 
patients. The only previous tests have been conducted on cancer patients, in 
whom antigen was found in higher quantities, according to the John Wayne Cancer 
Clinic. In all kinds of cancers, antigen is manufactured on the surface of 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
"If antigens are detected in urine, therefore, it is a virtually certain 
indicator that cancer is present in the system -- even if that cancer is so 
small that it is still undetectable through conventional diagnostic means," the 
clinic said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA clinic said that if the test lives up to its promise, "a routine urine 
test for cancer could be a standard part of every physical -- and the cancer 
death rate could drop dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The test will be conducted by obtaining urine samples from experimental 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Those who test positive for the presence of antigen will be contacted by 
researchers and informed "in a very tactful manner," said Gerri Farnell, a 
spokeswoman for the project. They will be encouraged to contact their own 
physicians and will undergo further testing by the UCLA researchers. 
</P>
<P>
In an on-air editorial during the Michael Jackson talk show, Green said that 
"KABC believes this project promises to be one of the most exciting 
developments in the process to cure cancer." But in a telephone interview 
later, he acknowledged that "the test itself is not a sure-fire test for 
whether you have cancer or not. It's part of a research experiment." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and KABC are seeking a total of 15,000 people to volunteer for testing -- 
with the expectation that many may drop out. To that end, experiment 
coordinators will go to three shopping malls this week to recruit more 
subjects. Test kits will be handed out today at Northridge Fashion Center, at 
Westminster Mall on Thursday and Friday and at the Westside Pavilion on 
Saturday and Sunday.

A REAL CINDERELLA STORY FOR A REAL SNOW WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Eileen Bowman was a child at St. Martin's Catholic grade school in San 
Diego, she was teasingly called "Snow White" because her skin was so fair and 
her brown hair so dark. 
</P>
<P>
Since being introduced as Snow White to a worldwide television audience on last 
week's Oscar telecast, an appearance being kept alive by a lawsuit filed by 
Walt Disney Co. against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Bowman 
said she has learned to like the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, a native of La Mesa, refuses to discuss the legal brouhaha that started 
when Oscar show producer Allan Carr decided to use a Snow White image that 
Disney lawyers claim was fashioned after the studio's trademarked character. 
But at a welcome-home party at the Abbey Restaurant in San Diego Saturday, 
Bowman's older sister, Bernadette, composed a song that contained what she 
called the seeds of the quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
To gales of audience laughter in the packed nightclub, Bernadette sang, 
"Disney's suing/Just because her little knees were shewing; Interviewers 
calling on the phone to bend her ear/My pride is showing, my sisterly love 
overflowing, but next time Enie please wear your skirt cut down to here." 
</P>
<P>
The irony of the suit, say Eileen's sisters and friends, is that Disney 
executives couldn't have found a more in-character Snow White than Eileen if 
they'd done the casting themselves. She doesn't smoke, drink, swear or even go 
to very many movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are too many things in the movies we don't need to see," Eileen 
said, adding that she had never seen an Academy Awards show before performing 
in the one last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said she's looking forward to receiving her check for the Snow White 
performance, but was not told how much it would be for, and never asked. 
Bernadette says her sister's greatest eccentricity is keeping a load of change 
at the bottom of her purse to have when approached for handouts on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen said that although she hated being called Snow White as a child, she 
took the name to heart. She collected Snow White memorabilia and played the 
character as a teen-ager at the San Diego Junior Theatre. Still, friends say 
they had to talk her into dropping out of a Youth for Christ chorus to try out 
for the role of Snow White in "Beach Blanket Babylon," a musical revue at the 
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the part, the play's director/composer Steve Silver asked her to 
audition for the 10-minute Academy Awards show opening that he was designing 
for producer Alan Carr. 
</P>
<P>
In that audition, Bowman, a 22-year-old novice with only nine months of 
experience singing show tunes at San Diego's Abbey Restaurant, won out over Pia 
Zadora, Lorna Luft, Ellen Green and Lucie Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
Was she nervous? 
</P>
<P>
"At rehearsals, I felt so nervous I thought I was really going to be sick," she 
said, adding that her greatest fear was having to approach celebrities in the 
front row during her number and shake their hands. "I thought I was going to 
look at one person and just forget my lines." 
</P>
<P>
The show's musical director, Marvin Hamlisch, eased her fears beforehand, she 
said, by telling her that Snow White was a bigger celebrity than anyone else 
there, and her own embarrassment disappeared when she saw how embarrassed the 
stars were when she approached them. 
</P>
<P>
"The first person whose hand I shook on camera was Michelle Pfeiffer," said 
Bowman. "She was so embarrassed, she couldn't even give me her hand. Then she 
started to laugh and giggle and that made me feel better. If she was nervous, 
then why should I be? Then, as soon as the curtain opened and I saw my friends 
on stage -- all the dancers -- I felt really great." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman leaves today for Las Vegas to begin playing Snow White in "Beach Blanket 
Babylon," but it's been a busy seven days. Since the Oscar show, she said she 
has heard from producer Aaron Spelling about doing a TV pilot, from various 
managers wanting to represent her, and from People magazine wanting an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope something good comes out of it," she said, quickly adding that she is 
interested in neither fame nor money, but in how she could use a career to help 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to be in the public eye, I would like to say there is hope. I see 
so many people who are so unhappy. They have so much money. They have so much 
fame. But you can't take that stuff with you. I think if I have money, I 
wouldn't keep any for myself. I would give it to others." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever ends up managing her career is going to have to overcome a major case 
of shyness. Although she had done ensemble work in musical production 
attractions at Sea World, it took her months to work up the nerve to sing solo 
at an "Open Mike" night at the Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends kept saying, 'Get up and sing,"' she remembered. "Finally, one 
night there were only five people in the restaurant and it was late so I said, 
'O.K."' 
</P>
<P>
With further coaxing from the Abbey's manager, Mike Lamry, Bowman began singing 
show tunes and became part of a regular Saturday night act at the restaurant. 
That was last June; nine months later, she's had television exposure from Los 
Angeles to Beijing, a fact that got sister Bernadette openly moping in her song 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Snow White's sister/Not an easy job I'll tell you, mister," Bernadette's 
song continued Saturday. "I've been in LA for seven years you know/She's there 
one day and gets Rob Lowe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Reached Monday at Universal Studios, where she works as a tour guide, 
Bernadette said she was still trying to sort out Eileen's good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so wide-eyed and I almost know too much," Bernadette said, "Eileen,' I 
said, 'Do you know who these people are?' And she said, 'Not really.' People 
would kill for this opportunity and my sister has no more sense of business or 
money than a gerbil. We used to call her Oblivia Newton John. At first she kept 
saying, 'I don't want to be here.' Now she says, 'Maybe I still can do this 
(show business) and still be a good person.' 
</P>
<P>
"Her goal was to be Snow White at Disneyland. With the lawsuit, I don't think 
it will happen now. But I really hopes she takes advantage of all this and 
realizes she has been given the talent and should do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Although she dashed away from the Shrine Auditorium before the Oscar show was 
over, Eileen acknowledges that her brush with fame has been seductive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a little like a dream come true," she said. "I've always loved Snow 
White because she's nice. I know that sounds weird. To tell you the truth I've 
never seen the movie. I just didn't want to see it. And I don't know why. 
</P>
<P>
"I just always knew I was different. I am used to being called Snow White by 
now and I thought If I'm going to be called it, I might as well get some use 
out of it. I feel really really lucky."

MAYOR AVOIDS COUNCIL DEBATE ON BANK TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's supporters Tuesday averted a potentially damaging Los 
Angeles City Council pre-election debate on his $18,000 Far East National Bank 
advisory post after the mayor told some members that "this is a purely 
political stunt by my opponent, Nate Holden." 
</P>
<P>
Two 6-7 votes prevented an immediate floor debate on measures by Holden, a city 
councilman who has emerged as Bradley's most visible foe in next Tuesday's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
One measure would have ordered the city to withdraw funds it has deposited in 
Far East. The other would have requested an investigation by City Atty. James 
K. Hahn on whether Bradley violated the City Charter by serving as an adviser 
to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley returned the $18,000 two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The council votes Tuesday effectively killed any chance of council debate on 
the Far East bank issue before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
The Holden proposals now will have to travel the usual and often-slow 
legislative route, first to be heard by a committee, then possibly rewritten by 
city attorneys and other aides. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hahn had already started his own investigation of Bradley's links 
with the bank, and the city attorney's office said Tuesday that it will 
continue, regardless of what the council has done. "It has no effect on us," 
Hahn aide Mike Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, interviewed in his office after the vote Tuesday, told how he had 
contacted five council members and told them, "This was a political gimmick on 
the part of my opponent." 
</P>
<P>
" 'I just wanted you to be aware of that,' " Bradley said he told the council 
members. "I also said to a couple of them that the city attorney is examining 
this whole issue and I will cooperate with him in every way." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley calls council members only on issues he considers of major importance. 
His efforts on this one pointed up his anger at Holden and his concern over the 
bank issue in the final days of a campaign the mayor is favored to win easily. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley victory came on votes so quick they left Holden surprised and 
unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Under council procedures, the rules had to be suspended to permit debate on the 
Holden measures without a committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
When it came time to decide, Holden stood by his desk toward the center of the 
horseshoe-shaped council desks. His coat was open, his hands were on his hips, 
and he looked ready for a debate. Several television cameras were on hand, 
lights on, prepared to give Holden the exposure his under-financed campaign has 
lacked. 
</P>
<P>
But Council President John Ferraro, who supported Holden, called for two quick 
votes before Holden could speak. Later, Ferraro explained to reporters that he 
had to do this because debate is not permitted on a motion to suspend the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed, Holden walked out of the chamber to an anteroom, the cameras 
following him, and spoke to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," he said. "This sends a wrong signal to the people. . . 
. It suggests that people in City Hall have something to hide. . . . City Hall 
should be an open book." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the fight against Holden was Councilman Marvin Braude, to whom the 
mayor had talked last Thursday. After a meeting on air pollution, Bradley asked 
Braude to talk privately with him. "He mentioned the matter very casually," 
Braude said. "I said I would look at it very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Braude objected to even voting on the matter. "You don't suspend the rules and 
engage in rhetoric a week before the election," he told a reporter afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Another Bradley vote was from Hal Bernson, who also spoke to Bradley. "He asked 
that I support him on this," Bernson said of his conversation with the mayor. 
"I told him I had already decided it (the council debate) shouldn't be used for 
political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Mayor 
</P>
<P>
Supporting the mayor were Bernson, Braude, Robert Farrell, Joan Milke Flores, 
Joel Wachs, Michael Woo and Gilbert Lindsay. Pressing for a Tuesday floor 
debate were Holden, Ferraro, Ruth Galanter, Gloria Molina, Joy Picus and Zev 
Yaroslavsky 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Bradley's connections with financial institutions has 
created a furor in the last days of a campaign that had started out as a 
walkaway. 
</P>
<P>
The Times disclosed that the mayor had received $24,000 a year for serving on 
the board of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan. Valley Federal has been 
involved in a tax dispute with the city and two of its subsidiaries have 
received city zoning changes. 
</P>
<P>
The previous week, the mayor disclosed he had served as an adviser to the Far 
East bank and was returning his $18,000 consulting fee after learning the city 
does business with the bank. He said he wanted to avoid any appearance of 
impropriety. However, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner was already at work on a 
story exploring Bradley's Far East bank ties. 
</P>
<P>
Far East is one of several banks receiving deposits of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Call Reported 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Herald Examiner reported that Bradley had received a telephone 
call from Henry Hwang, president of Far East National Bank. After that call, 
Bradley telephoned City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and discussed bank 
deposits. After that conversation, the city doubled its deposit in Far East to 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The two phone conversations have added to the furor over Bradley's connection 
with financial institutions. He has said "there was no impropriety" as he 
discussed the telephone calls with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, in an interview with Linda Douglass of KNBC-TV, Bradley said Hwang had 
"told me there was a rumor that the city was going to discontinue its deposit 
relationship with the banks. I told him I couldn't believe that because we are 
always looking for the best ways to maximize the return on our money." Then he 
said he called Rittenberg and asked him about the rumor. "The treasurer said 
'Oh, no, they were still looking very hard to get the kind of deposit that 
would earn the most money' for them." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview Tuesday, Bradley offered more details of his conversations 
with Hwang and Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked About Rumors 
</P>
<P>
He said Hwang had called him to inquire about rumors he had heard that the city 
was going to abandon its policy of depositing funds in various city banks. He 
said he called Rittenberg to inquire about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not believe it (the rumors)," Bradley said. "The city has always been 
very aggressive in getting the best return on its money." 
</P>
<P>
He said he then called Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of that conversation, Bradley first asked Rittenberg if the city 
had done business with Far East National Bank. "Not whether they did business, 
but whether they had in the past," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
When Rittenberg replied in the affirmative, Bradley said he made a decision. It 
was, he said, to resign as an adviser and return "that which had been paid to 
me in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation continued, Bradley said, and moved on to a discussion of the 
rumors Hwang had mentioned about the city abandoning its local bank deposit 
policy. At that point, Bradley said, Rittenberg assured him the rumors were 
untrue. 
</P>
<P>
After giving that account, Bradley declined to answer questions about it, 
saying he would withhold further comments until after City Atty. Hahn completes 
his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg was unavailable for comment Tuesday, his office said.

POLICE GET BREAK WITH PHOTOS OF GANG ATTACK; 2 YOUTHS STABBED, 5 ARE ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In what Santa Monica police detectives described as a rare break in their 
efforts to stem gang violence, a passer-by captured on film an attack on the 
edge of Santa Monica College that left two juveniles in critical condition with 
stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested in connection with the attack and booked for 
investigation of attempted murder. Police said the photographs, released 
Tuesday, will be used as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't find this kind of evidence," Detective Shane Talbot said. "The 
only thing that would be better is a video camera." 
</P>
<P>
The fight broke out at 7 p.m. Monday at a hamburger stand near Pico Boulevard 
and 18th Street, across the street from the campus. Police said several members 
of a Venice gang jumped two Santa Monica youths as "pay-back" for an alleged 
earlier attack by Santa Monica gang members on Venice rivals. 
</P>
<P>
One 16-year-old boy from Venice was stabbed in the first minutes of the fight 
and staggered, bleeding, across the street to fall a few yards from the office 
of the college's president, police and witnesses said. A second youth, a 
17-year-old from Santa Monica, was tackled by five Venice gang members near a 
crowded bus stop, beaten and kicked before one of his attackers stabbed him, 
Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called to Scene 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the scene by a city bus driver. The youths fled onto 
campus and down an alley near 20th Street. Police chased them, an officer fired 
a shot and the youths stopped and were arrested, Santa Monica Police Sgt. John 
Meihle said. 
</P>
<P>
Only later did officers learn that a passer-by had captured part of the 
incident on film. 
</P>
<P>
One of the passer-by's photographs showed five youths crouched over a sixth, in 
what police said was a beating that preceded the stabbing. Police said another 
of the at least five photographs showed youths carrying long sticks as they 
fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to identify the photographer. In a brief telephone conversation 
with The Times, the photographer declined to be interviewed, citing fears of 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Police released only one of the photographs, inking out the faces of juveniles 
in the picture. Talbot said the picture was released to "encourage people to 
come forward and . . . put the message out to other gang-bangers to go 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it often is difficult to find witnesses to Southern 
California's gang stabbings and drive-by shootings. Police and prosecutors said 
the photographs of the Santa Monica attack have allowed them to identify 
potential witnesses and have armed them with extraordinary evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, it's hard enough to get witnesses to come in and tell us what they 
saw with their own eyes," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Paula Palmer, who will handle 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
She had not yet seen the pictures, but said, "I anticipate the photos will be 
very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, seven men and boys were arrested. One juvenile was released when it 
was determined that he had not been involved in the fight, and one adult was 
held on unrelated allegations of parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
The other five -- plus the 16-year-old who is in the hospital -- are expected 
to face counts of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, police 
said. Arraignment was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The three adults who were in custody were identified by police as Lucio Miguel 
Raygosa, 24; Kenneth Hernandez Waller, 19, and Miguel Morales Sanez, 18, all of 
Venice. Names for the juveniles in custody -- a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old 
-- were not released. The names of the two youths being treated at UCLA Medical 
Center and Santa Monica Hospital were also not released. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College is located on the border of the city's Pico neighborhood, 
a traditionally low-income area troubled by sporadic gang violence and drug 
peddling. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the scale of crime in no way compares to other parts of the Los 
Angeles area, but gangs are known to frequent the neighborhood. 
</P>

Photo, This photograph, showing an alleged gang-related fight near Santa Monica 
College, was released by Santa Monica police. Detectives said it will be used 
as evidence in connection with the fight, in which two youths were stabbed and 
which led to the arrest of five men and boys. The photograph was taken by a 
passer-by, whose identity was withheld. The faces of two juveniles were 
obscured by authorities before the picture was released.

COUNCIL OKS BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council on Tuesday approved an ordinance outlawing the 
local sale of semiautomatic assault weapons, while reaffirming its support of a 
statewide ban on the sale of the military-style guns. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which would go into effect a month after its scheduled second 
reading next week, bans the sale of such semiautomatic weapons as the AK-47, 
the AR-15 and the Uzi. Unlike a ban recently adopted in Los Angeles, however, 
it does not make possession of the weapons illegal, prompting several council 
members to concede that the ordinance is weak. They nonetheless argued that it 
was better than nothing and approved it, 8 to 1. Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg 
voted against the proposal, saying, "I'm not to support this because the state 
can do it better." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail 
and a fine of $1,000, to sell semiautomatic rifles or carbines that accept 
magazines of 20 or more rounds, as well as shotguns that hold more than six 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Since a gunman killed five Stockton schoolchildren with an AK-47 in January, 
several cities in Los Angeles County have passed local assault weapon bans, 
including Los Angeles, Compton, Carson and Lynwood.

"The bomb was built to kill and he had the bomb, so we felt that if the

 -- Unnamed juror in the trial of makeup artist Donald Lee Morse, convicted of 
murder in the deaths of two police officers killed while dismantling a pipe 
bomb in Morse's basement. Although the trial judge disallowed defense arguments 
that the officers caused their own deaths by carelessness, jurors said they 
heard enough hints to know what the defense lawyers were getting at.

DEAD BABY'S MOTHER MAY BE CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified mother whose baby boy died at San Dimas Community Hospital one 
hour after birth may face criminal charges, depending on the outcome of an 
autopsy and other tests. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide detectives are investigating 
whether the infant -- born three months prematurely Monday -- may have died as 
a result of the mother's cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against such mothers are rarely filed, although Los Angeles County 
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said last year that more than 40 infant 
deaths were ruled "accidental, due to maternal drug abuse," and more than 30 as 
"natural, but with a history of maternal drug abuse."

REWARD OFFERS IN KILLING TOTAL $40,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council offered a $25,000 reward Tuesday and a teachers' 
union added $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the 
ambush slaying of Harold Arthur, a popular Grant High School teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The rewards, combined with the $10,000 already offered by the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, bring the total reward to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur, the Van Nuys high school's senior class adviser and a teacher since 
1961, was shot at least three times in the back as he got into his car in front 
of his Sherman Oaks home on the morning of March 24.

'I DID IT,' OFFICER QUOTES RAMIREZ AS SAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hours after his 1985 arrest, Night Stalker suspect Richard Ramirez told a Los 
Angeles Police Department officer, "I did it, you know. You guys got me, the 
Stalker," the officer testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. George Thomas told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury that Ramirez had 
spontaneously made numerous statements confessing his guilt but suddenly 
clammed up when he lifted his head from a table and saw Thomas writing down his 
words. 
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas, Ramirez said, "Of course I did it. So what? Shoot me. I 
deserve to die." 
</P>
<P>
No one else was in the interview room at the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division when 
Ramirez made the statements, Thomas said. He added that he had made no attempt 
to interview Ramirez except to ask the suspect his name. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said his assignment was simply to watch over the suspect until superiors 
arrived. At that point, Ramirez had not been advised of his constitutional 
right to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Ramirez, handcuffed to a chair, had his head down on the table as 
he began talking. But when he looked up and saw Thomas taking notes, he said, 
"Are you writing down everything?" 
</P>
<P>
Then Ramirez stopped talking and softly banged his head on the table up to 10 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramirez, a self-proclaimed devil worshiper, also showed Thomas a 
pentagram on his upper left arm, saying as he laughed: "You guys think I'm 
crazy, but you don't know Satan." Drawings of pentagrams have been found at 
several alleged Night Stalker crime scenes, including on one victim's thigh. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Thomas said, Ramirez began humming a tune from a song by a 
heavy metal rock group, AC-DC, called "Night Prowler." Thomas said he 
recognized the tune because, as a member of the interagency Night Stalker task 
force, he had spent many hours listening to that tune, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was taken to the Hollenbeck Division shortly after residents of East 
Los Angeles apprehended him and turned him over to police on the morning of 
Aug. 31, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Police Officer James R. Kaiser said authorities quickly took 
Ramirez away because they feared for his safety since up to 200 angry people 
had gathered at the arrest scene. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, who drove Ramirez to the station, testified that during the 10-minute 
ride Ramirez said to Kaiser and his partner, "Why don't you just shoot me? I 
want to die." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel V. Hernandez, one of Ramirez's lawyers, attempted during 
cross-examination to suggest that his client might have mistaken Thomas for a 
lawyer, but Judge Michael A. Tynan refused to allow such questioning, saying 
that would have called upon Thomas to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court Monday, Ray G. Clark, another attorney for Ramirez, said the 
defense in the case, expected to get under way next month, will be that "it's a 
case of mistaken identity." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, for the first time suggesting the defense strategy, added: "It wasn't 
him. He's no choirboy, but Mr. Ramirez was nowhere near these incidents." 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old suspect is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies 
growing out of a spree of nighttime residential attacks throughout Los Angeles 
County, mostly in the spring and summer of 1985.

MAN FOUND GUILTY IN DEATHS OF 2 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A makeup artist was convicted Tuesday of murder in the 1986 deaths of two Los 
Angeles Police Department explosives experts killed while trying to defuse a 
pipe bomb found in his North Hollywood garage. 
</P>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court jury deliberated for five hours before convicting 
Donald Lee Morse, 39, of murder in the Feb. 8, 1986, deaths of Detective 
Arleigh McCree, 46, and Officer Ronald Ball, 43. Jurors said they had 
understood, but rejected, oblique hints by the defense that the officers had 
caused their own deaths by careless handling of the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the victims' families greeted the verdict with brief cheers 
and clapping, while a murmur of anger ran through a group of Morse's family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
As he had throughout the four-week trial, the immaculately groomed television 
and film makeup artist remained composed, smiling weakly at one point, as the 
jury rendered its verdict of guilty on two counts of murder and one of 
possessing explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Morse did not testify at the trial but told police at the time of the explosion 
that he had never seen the two bombs found in his garage and had allowed others 
to use his garage for storage. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John H. Majors set May 3 for sentencing. Since jurors convicted Morse of 
special circumstances in addition to the murder counts, he could be sentenced 
to life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Optimistic About Appeal' 
</P>
<P>
No evidence was introduced in the trial suggesting why Morse would build and 
store bombs in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, defense attorney Bernard J. Rosen said he was "very, very 
optimistic about an appeal" on grounds that the defense was hobbled by Majors' 
refusal to allow introduction of evidence suggesting that the officers, the 
first Los Angeles bomb squad members to be killed in the line of duty, had 
caused their own deaths through carelessness. 
</P>
<P>
In disallowing such evidence, Majors said that state law does not permit a 
victim's negligence to be used as a murder defense unless such errors are the 
sole cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bomb was an illegal and deadly device, its possession was at least a 
contributing cause to the officers' deaths, Majors ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they picked up Rosen's frequent suggestions -- usually couched in 
questions that the judge promptly ruled out of order -- that the officers 
caused their own deaths, possibly by touching pliers to the positive and 
negative wires leading from the device. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what he was hinting at, but it wasn't a factor at all," said one 
juror, a 37-year-old salesman from Sylmar, who asked that his name not be used. 
"The bomb was built to kill, and he had the bomb, so we felt that if the 
officers made a mistake, it just wasn't important." 
</P>
<P>
Edie McCree, widow of the detective, said defense suggestions that the officers 
were negligent by not exploding the bomb at a remote location were "a bit hard 
to take" for herself and other family members who attended every day of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband "always tried to preserve the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"He always thought it was most important to convict the bomb maker," especially 
in a case where the suspect denies that it is his bomb, she said. 
</P>
<P>
McCree noted that by dismantling the first bomb, her husband and Ball had 
preserved evidence that was "important in getting this conviction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Juror Virginia Murray said the panel was largely persuaded of Morse's guilt by 
police testimony that they found blasting powder hidden inside a coffee can in 
a kitchen cabinet and that Morse had a copy of a bomb-making manual in his 
library. 
</P>
<P>
Police experts testified that the defendant's fingerprints were on the coffee 
can and the manual. 
</P>
<P>
"Without those prints, it would have been a really tough case to decide," 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Another juror noted that Morse had "the makings of a whole other bomb" 
scattered inside his house. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said that after five hours of discussing the evidence, they took a vote 
late Monday and it was unanimous for conviction on all three counts. The 
verdict was sealed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Morse, the defendant's 37-year-old brother who lived with him at the time 
of the blast, said that he and his brother "have no idea how the bomb got in 
that garage" and never saw the bomb manual before. 
</P>
<P>
He cooked dinner the night before the blast, Alvin Morse said, "and I know 
there was no blasting powder in that kitchen cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
"The police were in that house for hours after the explosion, and they could 
have planted anything in that house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Morse, a nightclub singer, said that fingerprints, including one of 
his prints that police said they found on the bomb manual, "must have been 
transferred there." 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Morse also said that police had "been after my brother for years on 
trumped-up charges," including arrests for rape and credit card fraud that were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they went to Morse's home to search for a pistol that had been used 
four days earlier to shoot an official of the Makeup Artists and Hairstylists 
Union, Local 706, of which Morse was a member. The pistol was not found and 
Morse was not charged in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, Rosen argued that Majors should have granted a defense 
motion for a change of venue. The defense lawyer contended that Morse, who is 
black, could not get a fair trial from an all-white jury in the San Fernando 
Valley, "where there are values that are different from values in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen declined to be more specific. But Morse's friends and relatives have 
complained throughout the trial that the defendant was being denied justice 
because of his race.

CAMARILLO STATE HOSPITAL PROGRAM JUDGED A SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
ART CLASSES PROVIDE OUTLET FOR PATIENTS' INNER TURMOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The paint-speckled tables may be loaded with every art supply imaginable, but 
the art studio at Camarillo State Hospital still doesn't seem equipped to teach 
the residents of Unit 25. 
</P>
<P>
A bony and pockmarked man named Joe rocks idly in a chair, his lips silently 
fluttering. A pale classmate named Bob giggles continuously at an inner stream 
of amusement. And James, a strapping man with wild eyes, accuses his instructor 
of plotting to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting bad vibes," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
An hour into their weekly art class, however, these chronically disturbed 
patients are immersed in painting, drawing and sculpture, thanks to an art 
therapy program introduced two years ago at the hospital, home to 1,225 
mentally ill and developmentally disabled men, women and children. 
</P>
<P>
James puts the finishing touches on a delicate clay horse between whose legs 
curls a two-inch human figure. Bob giggles at the Impressionist desert scene 
that he has just drawn in pastels. And a stack of quickly rendered but 
expressive drawings lie in front of Joe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Feeling' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of feeling in your work," art therapist Jack Cheney tells Bob, 
surveying a brightly colored landscape in which a lake climbs over the horizon 
and into the air. "There are people with degrees in art who wish they had that 
power." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 hospital residents who take 15 weekly classes from Cheney have been 
no less productive. 
</P>
<P>
Their work has filled two weeklong art shows at the hospital and garnered 
ribbons at the Ventura County Fair. It has been exhibited in the lobby of the 
Santa Paula Theater Center, during a production of "The Hothouse," a Harold 
Pinter play about a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
And hospital officials plan to open an art gallery next month where the works 
will be permanently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery, which will be open to the public on weekdays, will assemble 
hundreds of paintings, drawings and sculptures in the foyer and hallway of the 
hospital's Hagerty Building. Purchases can be arranged by calling Cheney at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators hope that the gallery, tentatively named Personal 
Images, will help form a positive impression for the Spanish-style hospital, on 
a verdant 370-acre campus four miles south of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone so far beyond the Nurse Ratched days," Cheney said, referring to 
the tyrannical nurse in the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Ken 
Kesey's portrayal of life in a mental institution in the 1950s. "Things have 
really changed." 
</P>
<P>
He said one hope is that the display of artwork will help build the self-esteem 
of the residents, who will receive the proceeds from sales. 
</P>
<P>
"For all that's wrong with them," Cheney said, "there's an awful lot that is 
right. We want to focus on that." 
</P>
<P>
People who have seen it are impressed with the art's expressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"It has such vitality and vigor, a real vibrancy that most painters don't 
have," said Jackie Wallace, an art teacher who has volunteered at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The work often lacks the self-consciousness seen in amateur art, said John 
Nichols, an art gallery owner who helped with the Santa Paula exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're professional, you've gone beyond technique," he explained. "You're 
just expressing the self. So it is with the work of the Camarillo people. It 
goes to the soul of the artist." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the intricate pencil drawings of the Camarillo patient who has yet to 
recover from the psychotic episode that he experienced years ago in front of an 
Aztec temple in Mexico. The drawings depict stylized ancient Indian warriors 
and Spanish conquistadors in dance-like movements. 
</P>
<P>
Or the ceramic self-portrait of the patient who fried his brain on drugs. 
Vacant-eyed beneath bright pink glaze, the bust rises into an exploding 
mushroom cloud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Grabs You' 
</P>
<P>
Or the figurines over which James, a schizophrenic, labored in a recent class. 
He explained that they depict a night when he slept between the legs of five 
white stallions on the grounds of the San Buenaventura Mission. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the sort of stuff being sold in the supermarket parking lot," said 
Tom Considine, a supervisor at the hospital. "It grabs you." 
</P>
<P>
The artwork is also reasonably priced. The hospital's patients usually set the 
prices for their works in the $5-to-$15 range. At the last show, about 200 
works were sold for about $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
The program's success has been traced to Cheney, 38. A boyish father of five 
who helped support his family for 14 years as a professional sculptor, he came 
to the hospital two years ago while completing a graduate degree in art therapy 
at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, a daylong version of the art show had been going on for two years 
but no formal art therapy program had been established because hospital 
officials were unable to find anyone up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He's Really Got a Knack' 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find a good art teacher who likes to work with the mentally ill," 
said Bamford Franklin, deputy director of the state Department of Developmental 
Services, which created Cheney's post a year ago. "When you find someone really 
good, you've got a treasure, and Jack's one. He's really got a knack." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney cheerfully juggles the demands of people with short attention spans, 
people who are motivated by inner voices and needs that always strike them as 
urgent. 
</P>
<P>
The class for Unit 25 residents, most of whom have been so ravaged by drugs or 
schizophrenia that they have little hope of being released, was typical. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney was busy. He had to keep an eye on one man who was trying to get high on 
water -- overconsumption produces a giddy feeling -- and at the same time, 
teach another patient to tie-dye, and start James, the horse sculptor, on 
another project in clay. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney said it is his dream job, explaining: "I've always wanted to address 
the pain, isolation and suffering I see in people." 
</P>
<P>
And pain and suffering there is. Take a recent class for six boys between 12 
and 16 who, at first glance, appeared to differ little from other boys their 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Told to outline one hand and fill the space with designs that reflected his 
state of mind, a boy who hears voices that instruct him to injure himself drew 
a network of bloody sores. 
</P>
<P>
A frail blond boy, who also hears voices, painted his ring finger orange 
because "people think I'm ugly." 
</P>
<P>
And a bright and affable boy who landed in the hospital after being physically 
abused by relatives ran a harsh gray scrawl through his drawing to represent 
his fellow patients, explaining that they terrified him. 
</P>
<P>
Such exercises enable people to explore feelings "one step removed" from 
themselves, said Evelyn Virshup, a Cal State Los Angeles art therapy instructor 
and the author of "Right Brain People in a Left Brain World," a study of 
art-therapy techniques applied to drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"You can explore yourself at a distance," she explained. "It makes it much 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
But such exploration often requires flexibility, as Cheney soon learned. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his first classes, he had no luck attracting the attention of four 
disturbed boys -- "a platoon of hyperkinetic commandos" -- until one tucked 
himself in a box he found in the studio. Soon Cheney had them all designing 
"womb-like" houses from other boxes. Eventually, the group went on to build a 
permanent clubhouse of bamboo outside their dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Using art as a means to inner peace is perhaps as old as time, but its use in 
psychotherapy dates to the 1940s, with art therapy becoming a recognized 
profession in the 1960s.

A small-town church in rural Hatfield has rung up a first-round victory in its 
battle of the bell. 
</P>
<P>
A judge has refused to silence the bell at the Hatfield Congregational Church, 
ruling that a couple next door who claim the ringing has left them with 
sleepless nights will have to prove their case at trial, a spokeswoman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hampshire Superior Court Judge John Murphy Jr. refused to grant a preliminary 
injunction that would have prevented the bell from tolling between 9 p.m. and 7 
a.m. each day, a court spokeswoman said.

ACCUSED SLAYER OF 16 DECLINES TO TAKE STAND; DEFENSE RESTS IN TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After one last, futile effort to persuade a judge to restrict 
cross-examination, lawyers for Randy Steven Kraft on Tuesday decided not to 
place their client on the stand to testify in his own behalf and instead rested 
their defense at his murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Kraft's attorney, C. Thomas McDonald, was a surprise and a 
disappointment for spectators in a packed Santa Ana courtroom, and added to the 
bitterness of some friends and relatives of the victims that Kraft is charged 
with killing. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet I'm angry," said a shaken Rodger DeVaul, whose 20-year-old son, Rodger 
Jr., was found slain in 1983. "Even if he got up on the witness stand and lied, 
the prosecutor might have gotten something out of him, so that we might have 
learned something about what happened. Now we will never know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Trial Since July 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, a Long Beach computer consultant, has been on trial for murder since 
last July in the deaths of 16 young men between the ages of 18 and 25 in Orange 
County. If Kraft is convicted, prosecutors have told the court they may present 
evidence suggesting that he killed as many as 29 other young men in California, 
Oregon and Michigan. If convicted, Kraft faces the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers told Judge Donald A. McCartin last week that their client 
wanted to testify about five of the 16 murders with which he is charged, but 
only if the judge would prohibit Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown from asking 
any questions about the other 11. The judge refused to make any rulings until 
after he heard Kraft's testimony on direct examination by the defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom has been two-thirds empty on most days since testimony began in 
September. But on Tuesday, after word spread that the defense was on the verge 
of resting its case, the courtroom was crowded and the usual number of news 
media representatives quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kraft definitely wanted to defend himself," McDonald said later, "but the 
judge's ruling precluded that." 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Kraft, under the U.S. Constitution, has a right not to 
answer prosecutors' questions concerning the 11 murders he chose not to testify 
about. But prosecutor Brown claimed that the 16 murders are linked by Kraft's 
method of operation. If would be impossible for Kraft to discuss five murders, 
the prosecution contended, without touching on circumstances involving the 
other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dead Marine in Car 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers on 
the San Diego Freeway in Mission Viejo found a dead Marine in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's decision not to testify has left jurors with no explanation of the 
circumstances of the Marine's death. Nor has the defense offered much 
explanation for pictures of some of the victims -- in lewd poses, and appearing 
dead or unconscious -- found in Kraft's car and at his house. 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments, expected to last two days, are scheduled to begin the week 
of April 17.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: SANTA ANA MAN SAWS HIS WAY TO SUPERSTAR STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call him "Super-Saw." Ask him why and he'll play a song on his saw. And 
that's how he got his moniker. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I just finished playing a fast-moving Latin song and the announcer 
cried out, 'Let's hear it for Super-Saw,' " said James A. Leonard, 56, a Santa 
Ana gas appliance repairman. "It just stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1975. Since then, Leonard has not only become a superstar saw 
player, but also an authority on the history of musical saws, which he has 
chronicled in his new book, "Scratch My Back." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has ever been written on the musical saw. And after a friend heard me 
play, I asked what she thought of writing a book on it. So we both wrote it," 
he said. His co-author is Janet Graebner of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
He said it's no wonder a book has never been written about musical saws. "Who 
ever thought of picking up a tool and playing music on it," said Leonard, who 
first became interested after reading an advertisement for musical saws. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said he has no illusions about the book becoming a best-seller -- or 
even making any money. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is limited," he admitted. "There are only about 35,000 saw players 
in the country. Of course, a lot of libraries might want to stock it." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard figures that there are 800 sawyers -- a name he coined -- in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties. "We had 2,000 books printed and hope we'll make enough 
money after expenses to afford a couple of malts and hamburgers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is marketing the book, Leonard has other irons in the fire. He and 
three other saw players recently recorded "Can't Cry Any More" with the rock 
group Kansas for a television video that he said took 15 hours straight to 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"That video was a blast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who has recorded three albums of his own, said he's never charged 
anyone for saw lessons or for his saw performances. "I do it for the fun of 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also has appeared twice on the "Gong Show" television program and is an 
infrequent performer at Disneyland. In between, he formed Sawyers Assn. 
Worldwide and plans to sponsor an international saw festival at Disneyland in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"Saw players have come a long way from the time they would whack a saw with a 
mallet to get it vibrating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I started. But after the second day, I couldn't stand the 
banging and bought a bow and started scratching the saw with it. Darned if I 
didn't get music from it." 
</P>
<P>
By his own ranking, Leonard is one of the top saw players in the country, and 
although he thinks saw playing is getting more popular, especially with younger 
people, he's setting the saw aside for a while for the harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying something different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quila Roder, third-grade teacher at Madison Elementary School in Santa Ana, 
thought it would be nice to put on a ballet program. So she advertised in 
newspapers for a volunteer dance teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Up popped Diane Wall, a former professional ballet instructor who now operates 
a real estate office in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
She not only provided classroom ballet lessons to the children three times a 
week but also supplied costumes for the class production. 
</P>
<P>
After a dress rehearsal, the students performed "The Nutcracker" ballet for the 
school's winter program and again for Adams Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Roder believes it pays to advertise.

MEDICAL CENTER'S ROAD COMPROMISE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved an agreement 
ending a dispute with UCI Medical Center over use of a road that both sides 
consider essential to their plans for more than $200 million in expanded 
facilities in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Board members voted, 4 to 0, with Supervisor Don R. Roth absent, to ratify the 
accord that allows both the county and UCI Medical Center to use the road known 
as Dawn Way and to share the cost of maintaining the private, four-lane road 
that divides university and county facilities east of the City shopping center 
mall in an area known as the Manchester Complex. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed not to pursue threatened legal action. County officials 
had filed a lawsuit to halt UCI's building of a 700-space, six-story parking 
garage next to the medical center. The UC Board of Regents has authorized a 
suit against the county to block a proposed expansion of Theo Lacy Branch Jail 
at the site. 
</P>
<P>
County officials forced the confrontation when they complained that UCI had 
begun building the garage without consulting the county or assessing the level 
of traffic that it would generate.

HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
A COLORFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST LITTER BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting today, beach-goers will see new, aqua-colored drums in Bolsa Chica and 
Huntington State beaches, city and state officials said Tuesday, as they 
unveiled an anti-litter program. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is part of "California Cleaning," a 1-year-old state pilot program 
aimed at increasing public awareness about litter problems. 
</P>
<P>
Each beach will have 300 drums -- donated by a local disposal company -- and 
will replace the 250 yellow drums in use at each beach, said Donald Castle, an 
employee with the state Department of Parks and Recreation. Each drum has a 
55-gallon capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The higher number of drums "will assist us greatly in containing the trash 
people drop off," he said, adding that from July to September, about 6,500 
cubic yards of garbage are hauled monthly, contrasted with 500 cubic yards per 
month the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-litter effort, which may be expanded to other state beaches, is also 
aimed at tourists and the money they bring to the state economy, California 
Waste Management Board member Sam Arakalian said. 
</P>
<P>
"People come from all over the states, and we want to present them with a clean 
beach," he said.

HOLLYWOOD MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man was ordered Tuesday to stand trial for murder in the January 
slaying of Newport Beach ophthalmologist Boonkert Chulapatrcheevin. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Court Judge Glenn A. Mahler, closing out a 4-day preliminary 
hearing in the Newport Beach court, ruled there was enough evidence to order 
Allen J. Lindsey, 23, bound over for trial on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
Chulapatrcheevin, 45, a native of Thailand, was found dead of a stab wound Jan. 
19 in his Balboa Peninsula duplex. Five days later, police arrested Lindsey in 
Hollywood after he was found driving the doctor's missing Mercedes-Benz 560-SL. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey and his attorney have maintained that the Hollywood man killed the 
doctor in self-defense and have suggested that the pair may have been 
homosexually linked.

SUSPECT IN MURDER OF GIRL IS FLOWN TO COUNTY, JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Lucio DeHoyos, arrested in Texas in connection with the slaying of 
9-year-old Nadia Puente of Santa Ana, was flown to Orange County and booked 
into jail Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos, 31, who since his arrest has told newspaper and TV reporters in San 
Antonio that he killed the school girl in a Santa Ana hotel room, had little to 
say upon his arrival at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The man who was the focus of an intense police investigation walked off an 
American Airlines flight in handcuffs, wearing a dress shirt and dark trousers. 
After shrugging off questions from a news reporter, he said only, "I need an 
attorney." 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos was brought to Orange County after he had waived extradition. He was 
accompanied on the flight by two Santa Ana police investigators. Security was 
tight at the airport Tuesday as DeHoyos and the two investigators were met by a 
third plainclothes police officer who quickly guided them to an unmarked police 
car. 
</P>
<P>
After being booked in Orange County Jail about 1:40 p.m. on suspicion of 
murder, DeHoyos was assigned an Orange County public defender, David Biggs, for 
his defense. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos is scheduled to be arraigned today in Orange County Municipal Court. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr. has been assigned to prosecute the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The murder victim, a fourth-grade student at Diamond Elementary School, was 
abducted March 20 on her way home from school. Her body, which was found a day 
later, had been stuffed into a trash can in Griffith Park in Los Angeles. 
According to the Los Angeles County coroner's office, she had been sexually 
molested and killed by asphyxiation caused by pressure against her chest. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos was "cooperative" during questioning by police Tuesday, police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said there is physical evidence that "positively links" DeHoyos to 
the girl's murder, but they have declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion, DeHoyos told San Antonio reporters that he had 
killed Nadia because he was angry while "on drugs," specifically cocaine. He 
was quoted as saying that he "drowned her" in a bathtub at a Santa Ana hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said that DeHoyos' statement that 
he drowned the girl is not inconsistent with the autopsy findings. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect has been described as a drifter who has lived in Los Angeles, Santa 
Ana, and other parts of Orange County during the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos' grandmother, who lives in Los Angeles, said her grandson left Los 
Angeles for San Antonio to visit his mother about 2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said security surrounding DeHoyos will be tight because of an earlier 
jail escape. DeHoyos was housed in a one-person cell at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos was first arrested Saturday by Santa Ana and San Antonio police at a 
taco stand in San Antonio. But he escaped the next day, police said, after 
wadding up a piece of paper and sticking it in the lock to his cell to prevent 
the lock from catching. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested again less than an hour later sitting on a bus bench a few 
blocks from the jail.

TEARS FLOW AT SENTENCING IN DRUNK-DRIVING FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tears streamed down the faces of many people in a small Fullerton courtroom 
Tuesday, and Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson observed that the fatal 
accident involving a drunk driver was "one of the most emotional cases" she had 
ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, his wife and several witnesses broke into tears as they 
addressed the court. 
</P>
<P>
Nominally, the case involved a man who pleaded guilty of drunk driving and 
causing a two-vehicle accident in Yorba Linda on Jan. 15 that killed one person 
and injured three others. But Judge Anderson said the case really involved the 
"tragedies" of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, you could take all alcohol and bury it," she said. 
"Ninety-nine percent of the cases that come to this courthouse are because of 
alcohol and other drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Vince Bivens, 27, of Monterey Park, waived his right to a jury 
trial and told the judge that he would plead guilty to the charges against him. 
He was accused of speeding while intoxicated on Jan. 15 and plowing into a Jeep 
with four persons in it at the intersection of Via Lomas de Yorba and La Palma 
Avenue in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Man Died 
</P>
<P>
One passenger, Carl Codispoti, 38, of Fullerton, was killed in the collision. 
Another passenger, Blaise Evers, 38, of Orange, suffered severe head injuries 
and was in a coma for 2 weeks. A third passenger, Shelly Petersen, 24, of 
Orange, suffered neck and vertebra injuries, the court was told. The driver, 
Terry Evers, 33, of Orange, sustained minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park told the judge on Tuesday that she believed that 
Bivens' case should be dealt with sternly, noting that Bivens was traveling at 
almost 70 m.p.h. and that his driving "was reckless and grossly negligent." 
</P>
<P>
Park noted that Codispoti, the man killed in the accident, had completed his 
master's degree in business adminstration from Cal State Fullerton and was 
looking forward to a bright future. "He was a person intent on life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Codispoti, brother of the accident victim, told the judge that life had 
changed for him because of his brother's death. "He was my best friend. . . . I 
live with that every day," he said. "I think Mr. Bivens should spend the rest 
of his life speaking to driving education classes (about the dangers of 
alcohol)." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Evers, brother of two of the passengers injured in the crash, also told 
the court that the case called for a strong sentence. He said that Blaise Evers 
is still undergoing treatment and will remain in the hospital another 1 1/2 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the accident victims began weeping in court as witnesses told the 
judge about the impact of the crash on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Bivens, then rose to face the relatives in the courtroom and 
pleaded for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Teary-eyed, his voice choked with emotion, he said: "I just want to say I'm 
very sorry for what I did. There was no intent at all; I was just driving too 
fast. It was an accident, and it's hard to live with. I've never been in 
trouble in my life. Now I live with it when I wake up, and when I go to sleep. 
. . . Please just forgive me for what I done. I'm willing to do whatever needs 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Bivens' wife, Donna, also rose to address the judge and the relatives of the 
accident victim. "I'm very sorry it took this to get him into AA (Alcoholics 
Anonymous)," she said, as tears streamed down her face. "It (Alcoholics 
Anonymous) has really helped, and I've gotten involved in Al-Anon. . . . It 
(the accident) has been a nightmare for us, too. We have two kids. Our home has 
been in an uproar." She added that she was willing to take "two or three jobs 
if necessary" to help get money for restitution to the accident victims. 
Turning to the victims' relatives, she said: "Every chance I get, I pray for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Although the judge said a pre-sentence investigation showed that Vince Bivens 
had never before had legal trouble and "lived an exemplary life," she proposed 
sentencing him to 4 years in prison and suspending that term on various 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"One condition is that the defendant spend 365 days in the Orange County Jail, 
and I can tell you that jail time is much worse than prison time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson further proposed requiring Bivens to pay back all "out-of-pocket 
expenses to the victims . . . all expenses not reimbursed by insurance." She 
noted that Bivens also would lose his driver's license for 3 years, be placed 
on 5 years' supervised probation and be under court order never to drink again 
or take any drugs. He also would be required to attend AA meetings and to make 
speaker appearances about the dangers of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said she found the proposed sentence appropriate. Bivens, after 
conferring with his attorney, Mike Meza, also agreed to the sentence. Later, 
Anderson issued a formal sentence and ordered him to enter jail May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the accident victims said outside the courtroom that they found 
the sentence to be a just one. "I think the judge was very fair," said Sean 
Evers, a brother of two of the accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Codispoti said: "Our family never had anything against the defendant. We 
believe that Carl has gone on to where the rest of us will go some day. In 
asking that (Bivens) be required to speak to groups about alcohol, I was just 
hoping that something positive could be made to come out of this tragedy."

POLICE HUNT GIRL REPORTED KIDNAPED BY EX-BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Tuesday were searching for a teen-ager who was kidnaped at gunpoint 
from her Santa Ana home by her estranged boyfriend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Family members told Santa Ana police that Cuong Tran, 24, forced his way into 
the 17-year-old girl's home in the 1000 block of West Central Avenue about 8:20 
p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled out a handgun and forced his ex-girlfriend to leave with him," said 
police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Tran fired several rounds into the apartment as he left, but no one was 
injured, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not know Tran's current address and declined to discuss his 
relationship with the girl, whose name was withheld because of her age. They 
said no one had heard from Tran or the girl since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at the girl's home declined to discuss 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Two neighbors who would not give their names said Tuesday that they heard two 
gunshots, looked outside and saw "a guy dragging a girl to the car."

KRAFT DOES NOT TAKE STAND AT HIS TRIAL; DEFENSE RESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense rested in the Randy Steven Kraft serial-murder trial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
To the disappointment of spectators crowded into a Santa Ana courtroom, Kraft's 
lawyers closed their case without putting their client on the stand. They kept 
him off after failing to persuade the judge to restrict cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
Among those upset to hear that Kraft wouldn't be testifying were some relatives 
of his alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet I'm angry," said a shaken Rodger DeVaul, whose 20-year-old son, Rodger 
Jr., was found slain in 1983. "Even if he got up on the witness stand and lied, 
the prosecutor might have gotten something out of him, so that we might have 
learned something about what happened. Now we will never know." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, a 44-year-old Long Beach computer consultant, has been on trial since 
last July for murder in the deaths in Orange County of 16 young men between the 
ages of 18 and 25. If Kraft is convicted, prosecutors have told the court that 
they may present evidence suggesting that he killed up to 29 other young men, 
including six in Oregon, two in Michigan and the rest in Southern California. 
If convicted, Kraft will face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers told Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin last week that 
their client wanted to testify about five of the 16 murders with which he is 
charged but only if the judge would prohibit Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown 
from asking any questions about the other 11. The judge refused to rule until 
after defense lawyers completed their questioning of Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom has been two-thirds empty on most days since testimony began last 
September. But after published reports that the defense planned to rest its 
case Tuesday, the courtroom was crowded and the number of news media 
representatives had quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
After calling three witnesses in the morning session, Kraft attorney C. Thomas 
McDonald announced that he might have one more witness in the afternoon. 
Instead, in the afternoon the judge permitted a rare hearing in his chambers -- 
outside public view -- for McDonald and co-counsel James G. Merwin to make 
another pitch for limiting cross-examination. The judge refused again to rule 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kraft definitely wanted to defend himself, but the judge's ruling 
precluded that," McDonald said later. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Kraft, under the constitution, has a right not to 
answer prosecutors' questions concerning the 11 murders he chose not to testify 
about. But prosecutor Brown claims that the 16 murders are linked by Kraft's 
method of operation. If would be impossible for Kraft to discuss five murders, 
the prosecution contends, without him touching on circumstances involving the 
other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers on 
Interstate 5 in Mission Viejo found a dead Marine in the front passenger seat 
of his car. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's decision not to testify has left jurors with no explanation of the 
circumstances of the Marine's death. Nor has the defense offered much 
explanation for pictures of some of the victims -- in lewd poses, and appearing 
dead or unconscious -- found in Kraft's car and at his house. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers have said they recognize that jurors may have some questions 
but believe that a defense has been presented to each of the 16 murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
The judge excused the jury until Thursday, when Brown is scheduled to begin 
calling rebuttal witnesses. Brown said that phase of the case would probably 
take less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told jurors that closing arguments would be made the week of April 
17. Lawyers said closing arguments would take 2 days. 
</P>
<P>
Once jurors begin their deliberations, Judge McCartin has scheduled to have 
them sequestered at a local hotel until they reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
If Kraft is found guilty, the trial then will move into a penalty phase, where 
the same jurors will have one issue before them: whether to return a verdict of 
death or life in prison without parole. Should Kraft be acquitted, he would 
automatically be held for other jurisdictions where he is suspected of serial 
killings.

DISPUTED HOMER GIVES EDISON 1-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL PRESTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean View High School pitcher Mike Karpel gave up only one hit Tuesday, but 
the hit -- Jason Serafin's disputed home run -- was all Edison needed to score 
a 1-0 Sunset League baseball victory at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the bottom of the fourth inning, Serafin lined a pitch off a 
tree branch that hangs over the left-center field fence near the 375-foot sign. 
After first deciding that Serafin's hit was a ground-rule double (the ball 
bounced back onto the field), the umpire changed his mind and ruled the hit a 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire's reversal angered Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett, who was ejected 
from the game for disputing the call. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball hit a tree branch that hangs 15 feet over the fence, and that 
prevented my center fielder (John Arnold) from being able to play the ball," 
Barrett said. "(Edison Coach Paul Harrell) didn't bring up what happens when 
balls hit that tree during the pregame meeting, and the umpire was going to 
rule that hit a double before (Harrell) pressured him into giving (Serafin) a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake for Paul Harrell not to bring up the tree before the game, 
and you would have thought that they were going to bring it up during the 
pregame discussions because of it hanging over the field." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrell: "I didn't bring up the tree before the game, but still, there was 
no way anyone was going to catch that ball because it was a line shot that was 
going over the fence when it hit the tree." 
</P>
<P>
Serafin's hit supported the four-hit pitching of J.J. Thobe (2-1), who survived 
a sixth-inning scare to record the victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and two outs, Edison left fielder Brian Higgins made a 
lunging, backhanded catch of Mike Burns' sinking line drive to deny Ocean View 
(11-4, 3-1) a chance to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Before Serafin's homer, Edison (5-6-2, 2-2) could get only one baserunner off 
Karpel (1-2) -- when Higgins reached second on shortstop Daniel Hernandez's 
throwing error in the first. After the homer, Karpel retired the last seven 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
"J.J. didn't have his best stuff today, but he was able to get the ball in good 
positions, and the kids made some good defensive plays to back him up," Harrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Higgins' catch) was the play of the game," Barrett said. "Without that catch, 
we would have won the game. We had other situations when we had guys in scoring 
positions, but we couldn't cash them in, and you can't win games unless you 
cash in on your opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 7, Marina 5 -- Fountain Valley trailed, 5-1, but scored six 
runs in the top of the sixth for the victory. Steve Grack had a two-run single 
in the inning, but Fountain Valley (8-4, 3-1) also benefited from three Marina 
errors. Grack had two hits and three RBIs. Don Cossett (2-0) pitched one inning 
in relief for the victory. Mark Newfield had a two-run homer in the fourth for 
Marina (2-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 7, Huntington Beach 3 -- The Lions took advantage of nine walks and 
five Huntington Beach errors for the victory at Huntington Beach. Ryan Klesko 
had a two-run homer for Westminster. He also walked three times, stole two 
bases and scored three runs. Brent Heredia went two for three with an RBI for 
the Lions.

LOCKHEED SETS STOCK PLAN FOR WORKERS, WILL SHED 4 UNITS AND LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being a potential takeover target for years because its shares are 
considered undervalued, Lockheed unveiled a corporate overhaul Tuesday that 
includes an employee stock ownership plan, sale of some Burbank real estate, 
disposal of smaller operations and a dividend increase. 
</P>
<P>
Among the divisions Lockheed plans to sell is CalComp in Anaheim, a computer 
graphics company with 1988 revenues of more than $450 million. The company 
employs 1,200 people in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellup disclosed that the 
Calabasas-based aerospace firm is holding discussions with McDonnell Douglas on 
a potential subcontracting deal to assemble stretched MD-11 jetliners and with 
Netherlands-based Fokker for the assembly of F-100 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
The major restructuring, which is intended to improve the value of Lockheed 
shares and reinforce defenses against corporate raiders, came one day after 
Texas investor Harold C. Simmons disclosed that he owns 5.3% of Lockheed's 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tellup said the restructuring has been in the works since last fall and that 
the announcement of the plan Tuesday was only coincidental to Simmons' 
disclosure Monday. Tellup said he does not regard Simmons' $150-million 
investment in Lockheed as the start of a hostile takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the actions had the overarching objective of increasing shareholder 
value and positioning Lockheed for long-term growth," Tellup said at a news 
conference Tuesday morning in Calabasas. "Nothing we do can prevent a fair 
value offer (by a corporate raider)." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons reacted negatively to the restructuring effort, saying: "I'm 
disappointed. I hadn't expected them to react like this to my investment. It's 
not good value for the shareholders. I'm considering selling some or all of my 
stock. I made an investment based on the outlook for the company and the 
aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed shares gave up $2 in New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, closing 
at $47.75. On Monday, they had gained $3 on news of Simmons' investment in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed also disclosed Tuesday that it expects that its 1989 earnings from 
continuing operations will decline by 25% from the $442 million reported in 
1988. The decline is attributable to completion of the C-5B cargo jet program, 
high tax rates and cost increases in some other military programs, the company 
said. But profits should grow in 1990 and beyond, Tellup said. 
</P>
<P>
Under its complicated restructuring plan, Lockheed created an employee stock 
ownership plan that acquired about 10.5 million shares of newly issued Lockheed 
stock for $500 million. The ESOP borrowed the money to pay Lockheed for the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lockheed has started buying back 10.5 million shares of its 
stock on the open market, thereby eliminating any dilutive effect that the 
newly issued stock would have on existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tellup said the ESOP, whose participants will be salaried employees, is 
expected to "get employees more involved and productive" and secondarily may be 
a takeover defense. After the ESOP is in place and all the outstanding shares 
are repurchased, Lockheed employees will own about 17% of the company's stock, 
a voting bloc that could help thwart a hostile takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
The company also disclosed that it will accelerate by one year the plans it 
disclosed in 1988 to move virtually all manufacturing, parts fabrication and 
engineering activities out of Burbank to newer facilities in Palmdale, Rye 
Canyon and Marietta, Ga. The move will be completed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 employees will move to new job locations, leaving about 7,000 
behind in Burbank. The move may result in some layoffs, but no more than 300, 
Tellup said. 
</P>
<P>
After vacating the aged Burbank facilities, some of which were constructed 
during World War II, Lockheed will sell about 225 acres of valuable land 
adjacent to the Burbank airport. Tellup said the company does not have an 
estimate of the value of the land, but commercial land brokers have said the 
land is worth more than $1.5 million per acre, indicating that the 225 acres 
might be worth more than $337 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company will keep the headquarters of its Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. 
in Burbank, where Lockheed has been building aircraft since 1928 when founder 
Allan Loughead moved his small airplane company into a former china factory 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Tellup said he hoped that the move of 7,000 employees, mainly to Rye Canyon 
near Valencia and Palmdale, will be accomplished with a minimum of disruption. 
Company surveys have indicated that many workers will not have to move from 
their present homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another element of Lockheed's restructuring is a plan to sell the parts of its 
information systems group, including CalComp, CADAM of Burbank, Metier of 
Burbank and Lockheed Dataplan of Los Gatos. The four companies had 1988 revenue 
of $589 million. They are believed to be more profitable than many of 
Lockheed's weapons contracts, but Tellup said the company wants to focus on its 
primary businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed will also form a new anti-submarine warfare office in Washington in an 
effort to win contracts in that growing Navy market. Lockheed is building the 
Navy's Long Range Air Antisubmarine Capable Aircraft, which has recently been 
renamed the P-7. 
</P>
<P>
In a final reorganization move, Lockheed will create a new technology services 
group to consolidate such operations as space shuttle processing, engineering 
sciences, data processing, and aircraft and airport facilities modernization 
and maintenance. The group will have $1 billion in revenue and is expected to 
build up "entrepreneurially," Tellup said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas spokesman Don Hanson confirmed that talks with Lockheed have 
been conducted, but he said they are "preliminary."

EECO REPORTS NET LOSS OF $13.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EECO Inc., which recently sold a large money-losing operation as part of a 
reorganization, Tuesday reported a net loss of $13.5 million for its fiscal 
1988 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 1. It had net income of $717,000 for the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Santa Ana-based maker of keyboards and electronic switches 
announced that Chairman Robert B. Bonney will replace Robert C. Milo as chief 
executive officer. Milo will remain as the company's president, overseeing 
keyboard operations in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
EECO's large loss includes $7.7 million from operations of its video editing 
division, which was sold in December to British-based Paltex Editing &amp; 
Production Systems Ltd. for an undisclosed price. In addition, the company 
recorded a $5.2-million loss as it reduced the value of its computer-keyboard 
inventory to reflect shrinkage and obsolescence. 
</P>
<P>
In February, EECO agreed to sell its airline passenger entertainment business 
to Boston investors for $15 million in cash and notes. The company said it 
hopes to complete the sale of its avionics division later this year. In 
addition, the company is discussing selling its hotel computer property 
management subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the most recent quarter was down 6% to $13.9 million; it was $14.8 
million for the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
For all of fiscal 1988, EECO reported a net loss of $13.2 million; it had $1.5 
million in net earnings for fiscal 1987. Revenue for the year was up 10% to 
$85.1 million; the previous year's revenue was $77.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Their losses were very large, but the housecleaning is complete, and now they 
have a very good opportunity to soon be making money," said Mark Matheson, an 
analyst at Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney, the company's 74-year-old founder, described the performance as "very 
disappointing." He said by selling its unprofitable businesses and cutting 
costs, the company can become profitable again. 
</P>
<P>
He would not speculate on when the company will return to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney said he will take over as the company's chief operational officer "as 
long as is necessary." He said there are no plans to seek a successor for the 
position.

TRIMEDYNE PREDICTS DECLINE IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trimedyne Inc., a rapidly growing maker of laser catheters in Santa Ana, said 
Tuesday that it expects second quarter net earnings to be lower than the 
$769,000 earned in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the expected decline to the cost of growth. During the 
quarter, the company increased spending for staff, manufacturing, research and 
development, and clinical testing programs. 
</P>
<P>
It plans to release financial results for its fiscal second quarter, ended 
March 31, within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's fortunes had been soaring since March, 1987, when it won Food and 
Drug Administration approval to market its laser catheter to treat 
arteriosclerosis in the legs. The company said Tuesday that it expects sales to 
increase 35% to $9.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1989, compared to 
$7 million in the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne reversed years of losses in fiscal 1987 when it reported net earnings 
of $440,000. For fiscal 1988 earnings topped $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement came as a surprise to industry analysts, who had 
generally projected earnings of about $6.9 million for the current year. 
Analysts said estimates for fiscal 1989 now may be reduced as much as 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's stock lost 12% of its value Tuesday, closing down $1.625 per share 
to $11.75 in unusually heavy trading of 570,400 shares. Trimedyne stock traded 
as high as $24 per share last year. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, said 
the company must spend more money to attract additional sales because it is now 
facing more competitors in a field that it pioneered. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne President Howard K. Cooper said that he expects the earnings downturn 
to be "short-term" and that the spending should result in greater long-term 
profits.

PROVOCATIVE, CORROSIVE 'EDMOND' UNRAVELS AFTER A PROMISING START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's production of David Mamet's "Edmond" starts with a lone 
sax man dressed up like a Blues Brother and blowing hard under a moody 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
The guy's not bad -- the riffs are bluesy, progressive, a little off; it's the 
right foreshadowing for Mamet's corrosive black comedy of low-lifes and living 
in New York City. Yeah, mournful, urgent and a bit crazy, not bad. 
</P>
<P>
But it all unravels soon enough after the last notes are played. Under Leonard 
Meenach's unimaginative direction, the drama is the stage equivalent of labored 
breathing. Making the intense, scatological and almost always provocative Mamet 
stiff is some accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the acting. Mamet's characters, especially the principals, are out 
of reach for most of these student actors. Many of the performances walk the 
wire with weak legs, and with Mamet, there's never any net. 
</P>
<P>
"Edmond" is a spookily intriguing play, but it's not one of his best works -- 
too often it's sensationalistic without being resolved. The scenes are often 
padded with popular cliches of New York seediness and sex, moments stuck in 
resin. But "Edmond" does have a dirty force that can tie us to a sense of doom, 
of a life careening away from itself as Edmond (Michael Denney) pinballs from 
one ugly encounter to the next. 
</P>
<P>
The plot begins with ordinary domestic turmoil. Edmond, a middle-aged tie and 
suit, leaves his wife, goes drinking in a bar and then embarks on a quest for 
sex that takes him into Manhattan's underground. He's pushed around in almost 
every scene -- even street shills beat on him -- and in turn he starts to 
brutalize those he comes across. What's unsettling is how quickly he becomes a 
part of the seaminess. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these moments spit with violence or the threat of it, but "Edmond" 
never strays far from its nature as one long off-color joke. Edmond, no matter 
how bad the situation gets, always wants to know how much it's all going to 
cost. How much are the hookers? How much to play the corner shell game? How 
much for that knife? 
</P>
<P>
It's his mantra. He's a middle-class nebbish who adjusts but never really 
understands the implications of what's happening to him. It's sad, but funny, 
too. He's the butt of the cosmic joke, life's punch line. 
</P>
<P>
At CSUF, it would help if we weren't so removed from Edmond. Denney's hold of 
the character is too tenuous -- he doesn't seem to fully understand what 
motivates Edmond to leave his wife and take this trip down, and how he's 
changed during the journey. Without the actor putting the meaning between the 
lines, the audience can be left dangling. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cast members generally take a hard-boiled stance in approaching 
their roles. Another mistake of Meenach's is to minimize variation in the 
characters; not all New Yorkers, seedy or not, are this humorless and cynical. 
Even a pimp can have irony in his soul. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are a few capable performances. Rich Ascroft as the black prisoner 
who sexually humiliates Edmond and then begins something of an inmates' 
marriage with him is dynamic in his few scenes. George Anthony Herrera, in a 
handful of parts from a shill to a policeman, has a natural delivery, as does 
Sylvia K. Biller, who plays a waitress Edmond sleeps with and accidentally 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
In prison, Edmond comes to realize something of what he is. This self-knowledge 
sets up the play's controversial ending. Most critics have condemned the moment 
when Edmond gently kisses the prisoner who has earlier sodomized him and holds 
his hand lovingly as simplistic and disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
But that misreads the scene. Mamet isn't laying out a moment of love and 
redemption; the scene is the playwright's last big sneer at Edmond and what he 
represents. It's a manifestation of the Everyman's weak acceptance of his place 
in the world, and that acquiescence deserves harsh laughter. 
</P>

Two Southeastern banking giants are girding for a long battle as North 
Carolina-based NCNB Corp. stands by its $2.4-billion hostile takeover bid for 
Georgia-based Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens, a $21-billion bank holding company based in Atlanta, has rejected the 
NCNB bid and invoked Georgia's anti-takeover law. It has also hired an array of 
legal experts and financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB, the $50-billion banking behemoth of the 
growing Southeast region, has reiterated its intention to carry out a deal that 
would be among the biggest mergers in American banking history and create the 
nation's sixth largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Divided 
</P>
<P>
NCNB also urged Citizens to reconsider its offer to exchange one share of 
Citizens for 1.075 shares of NCNB in a stock swap valued at $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were sharply divided over how effective the defenses would be. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Coffey Jr. of Nashville, Tenn.-based J. C. Bradford &amp; Co. sees a 
protracted fight by Citizens to stay independent. 
</P>
<P>
"All indications are that Citizens &amp; Southern management will do everything 
in its power to rebuff NCNB. . . . The management is hesitant to hand over 
annualized earnings growth of 13% to 15% to another party," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Increase Pressure 
</P>
<P>
However, Morgan Stanley analyst Dennis Shea predicted that Citizens will put up 
"what looks like quite a fight, but in the end I don't see any points raised as 
hurdles that can't be overcome. If NCNB needs to boost its bid modestly to get 
the deal on a friendly basis, I see them doing that," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hanley of Salomon Bros. said NCNB "may choose to put even more pressure 
on Citizens' board by modestly increasing the terms of the offer. . . . I have 
a feeling this may not drag out beyond the next six to nine months." 
</P>
<P>
NCNB stock has risen handsomely over the past several months as institutional 
investors have been bullish on the company's profit outlook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operates in 7 States 
</P>
<P>
However, one analyst who asked not to be identified questioned Wall Street's 
ebullient view, noting NCNB may find its resources strained if it were to add 
Citizens to its new Texas assets. 
</P>
<P>
NCNB operates in seven Southern states and manages assets of more than $50 
billion. Its own assets totaled $29.85 billion at the end of 1988, but it also 
manages $25.6 billion in assets that belonged to Dallas-based First 
RepublicBank, of which it bought a 20% interest last summer and renamed NCNB 
Texas. It also acquired a five-year option to buy the remaining 80% from the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Problems 
</P>
<P>
"The government is aiding them in taking over First RepublicBank and then 
they're trying to use those tax breaks to try to buy us," said Citizens' 
spokesman Scott Screedon. 
</P>
<P>
He said Georgia regulators would likely oppose the proposed takeover "because 
of the possibility that Georgia assets may be expected to be shifted to Texas" 
to help NCNB fulfill its commitment to revive First RepublicBank. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens' officials also told analysts in a briefing Tuesday that NCNB's 
capitalization would be weaker if it takes over Citizens. They said this flies 
in the face of the Federal Reserve Board's position in the past that the 
survivor in a bank merger must have stronger capitalization than before the 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens' Screedon said his bank is "more strongly capitalized than NCNB . . . 
in effect they'd weaken us if we were acquired."

A 2-year-old Pasadena girl was shot and killed when the station wagon in which 
she was riding with her grandmother and several other children was fired upon 
Tuesday evening in Rubidoux, authorities said today. They said the motive was 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Karina Cherise Williams was pronounced dead at Riverside Community Hospital 
shortly after the 8:15 p.m. shooting, said Lt. Nick Padilla of the Riverside 
County Sheriff's Department. He said several shots were fired at two vehicles 
carrying eight adults and four children in the same party. The attack occurred 
less than a block from a home where the girl and her grandmother had visited 
relatives.

BAN ON IMPORTING SEMIAUTOMATIC GUNS EXPANDING, WHITE HOUSE SAYS

<P>
The Bush Administration said today that it is expanding a recently imposed ban 
on the importation of semiautomatic assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush accepted a 
Treasury Department recommendation that the ban be widened, effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The action expands the ban to cover all imports of the high-powered, rapid-fire 
weapons, Fitzwater said. The previous ban, announced in early March, covered 
only about 80% of imports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the initial ban on such weapons, including the AK-47 assault 
rifle, was aimed at fostering "a climate in which reasonable and well-intended 
people . . . could work out a thoughtful solution" to the proliferation of such 
weapons. He said the department is imposing a ban on an additional 24 types of 
guns "to review their suitability for sporting purposes."

ISRAEL CLAIMS GAZA STRIP UPRISING OVER, FREES 474

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel freed 474 Palestinian prisoners today and claimed that the occupied Gaza 
Strip, where a nearly 16-month-old Arab uprising began, had been pacified. 
</P>
<P>
Promoted as a good-will gesture for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, the 
release coincided with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's arrival in Washington 
for tough talks with the U.S. government on Israel's handling of the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
At an airfield near Gaza City where 224 prisoners were freed, Brig. Gen. Aryeh 
Ramot, head of the Gaza civil administration, told reporters: "We have managed 
to pacify the area and bring it back to normality." 
</P>
<P>
But in clashes today, troops shot and seriously wounded a 14-year-old 
Palestinian in the head in Gaza City and wounded three schoolchildren with 
rubber bullets in the Khan Younis refugee camp, hospitals reported. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the prisoners freed were stone-throwers or minor activists, let out a 
few days before the expiration of short jail sentences. Among them were 50 
youngsters aged between 12 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, 250 prisoners were released, including 106 political 
activists held without trial in harsh conditions at the controversial Ketziot 
prison camp in the Negev desert. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said almost twice that number had been proposed for release 
but the Shin Bet security service vetoed the freeing of many senior activists 
at the last moment.

A burglary suspect was shot to death by Inglewood police on the Santa Monica 
Freeway this morning after a two-hour, 100-mile chase through three counties at 
speeds of up to 100 m.p.h., officers reported. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they shot Javier Salvador Arreola, 23, after finally stopping him 
at 2:16 a.m. on the eastbound lanes near La Brea Avenue because he appeared to 
be rummaging for a weapon. They said they found "a substantial amount" of 
cocaine in his van, but it was not immediately determined whether he had a 
weapon. Officers said the pursuit began after Arreola was seen circling a 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the freeway was blocked for more than four hours by the police 
investigation.

SOUTHLAND BAKES 2ND DAY: MERCURY 102 IN SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. AND L.A. RECORDS, SHATTERED 
</P>

<P>
A record-smashing heat wave blistered Southern California for the second 
straight day today, with the mercury soaring to a record 102 by 1 p.m in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said little relief is expected before Sunday. The 1 p.m. reading in 
El Toro was 101 and the Los Angeles Civic Center had hit 99 by that hour, well 
on the way to a predicted high of 104 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said Los Angeles -- or some other community in the area -- 
might well be the hottest spot in the nation today. Temperatures are expected 
to peak in the high 90s through Saturday, before dipping into the high 70s 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the previous record high for this date was 84, set in 1904. 
In Los Angeles, the previous record was 90, set in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The glaring sun baked the inland areas of the county and even caused unusually 
hot temperatures in normally cool beach communities. The morning temperature 
jumped to 90 degrees at Huntington Beach shortly after 10 this morning and was 
still climbing, lifeguards reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Seal Beach, which usually stays cool because of ocean breezes, the noon 
temperature climbed to 94 degrees today. Hordes of people headed to the ocean 
waters there to cool off, lifeguards reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, Lifeguard Lt. Steve Davidson said that lifeguards are 
"operating at a skeleton staff, and so we're warning people to be very careful, 
especially since the water is colder this time of year and it makes people tire 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department officials said today they are worried about 
tinder-dry conditions in the canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of concern about this weather," said Orange County Fire Capt. 
Hank Raymond. "Red flags are not out yet, because fortunately there haven't 
been strong winds so far with this hot weather. We've been pretty fortunated so 
far. But it's very dry, and anything will burn." In Santa Ana, some high 
schools planned to shift some classes on sun-baked sides of school buildings to 
rooms in shaded, cooler areas. 
</P>
<P>
Today's predicted highs included 104 in Montebello and Monterey Park; 103 in 
Van Nuys, El Monte and San Gabriel; 102 in Inglewood, Culver City, Long Beach, 
Northridge, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena and Pomona; 101 in Thousand Oaks and 
Simi Valley, and 100 in Westwood, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Azusa, Covina, Canoga 
Park and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
That's even hotter than it was Tuesday, when the thermometer peaked at 100 at 
the Los Angeles Civic Center, breaking the old record for the date, also set in 
1971, by 7 degrees. Other top readings Tuesday included 101 in San Gabriel, 
Long Beach and Monrovia and 100 in Culver City, Montebello and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittman, a meteorologist for WeatherData, Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times, said the hot, dry weather was caused by two areas of high 
pressure, one in the upper atmosphere over the Pacific Northwest, the other 
nearer the surface over the Great Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Air flowing from these highs toward the relatively lower pressure off the 
Pacific Coast, he said, is being heated and dried out by compression as it 
cascades down coastal mountain slopes toward the sea.

A 20-gallon barrel of salad oil fell off a truck in Newport Beach today, 
coating the southbound lanes of Newport Boulevard and causing a shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred about 10 a.m. near Hospital Road. All southbound lanes were 
closed while Newport Beach firefighters cleaned up the oily mess. No one was 
injured, but the truck driver was cited by police for the spill.

New calculations show Mars may have been stripped of a thick atmosphere that 
allowed water to flow over the now-desolate planet because it was bombarded by 
comets or asteroids, scientists reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Mars, the planet that is fourth closest to the sun, currently has a very thin 
atmosphere with a surface pressure less than one-hundredth of Earth's. But 
geological forms on the red planet suggest it once had atmospheric pressure 
great enough for water to run over its surface. 
</P>
<P>
H. J. Melosh and A. M. Vickery of the University of Arizona, in a study 
published in the British journal Nature, presented computer calculations they 
said showed that collisions with large, fast-moving bodies, such as comets, may 
have triggered Mars's atmospheric loss.

Soviet chess authorities today blamed the father of 14-year-old chess player 
Gata Kamsky for his defection in New York last week, saying he was forcing his 
son to become "a robot for dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Sovietsky Sport quoted Alexander Roshin, the head of the Soviet 
chess delegation taking part in the New York tournament, as saying Kamsky's 
progress in the game had halted because of too many demands from his father. 
</P>
<P>
"Gata Kamsky is destined to become a robot for earning dollars and his father 
has consciously agreed to that, for fear that his son's talent will not last," 
Roshin declared. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager told a New York news conference Monday that he had asked for 
political asylum in the United States because he was discriminated against at 
home.

SOLDIERS STAGE NEW THREAT TO HAITI LEADER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soldiers from Haiti's main military barracks attempted a coup that failed 
during the night, military sources said today, and later began radio broadcasts 
calling for President Prosper Avril to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were from the Dessalines battalion, whose barracks adjoin Avril's 
presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
The move sent Port-au-Prince into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Haitians were rushing home, and schools and shops in the Haitian capital closed 
after the soldiers' message was broadcast about 10 a.m. on independent Radio 
Metropole. 
</P>
<P>
Four light tanks belonging to the Presidential Guard were wheeled into position 
on the lawns in front of the palace following the soldiers' radio statement, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, according to Radio Haiti, 50 officers and soldiers met the 
press and said they wanted Avril to resign, accusing him of trying to set up a 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers said they were not isolated and were counting on support from 
other units. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy shooting was heard near the presidential palace overnight, just three 
days after Avril foiled a coup attempt by dissident members of the Leopards 
battalion. The three leaders of that attempt were expelled to the Dominican 
Republic on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
No details were immediately available on the apparent coup attempt during the 
night, but one source close to the military said negotiations had been 
continuing through the early hours of the day to work out a solution. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the rebels made it clear they wanted Avril, who took power in 
a coup six months ago, to step down.

Lech Walesa and a government minister today concluded a historic pact to 
legalize the independent Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban and to 
hold Poland's first free elections since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Solidarity leader, representing the opposition, and the interior minister, 
Gen. Czeszlaw Kiszczak, endorsed hundreds of pages of agreements hammered out 
during intensive talks on Poland's political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
They approved the pact as the 57 participants in the 2-month-old negotiations, 
known as the round-table talks, gathered for one last time at the Council of 
Ministers Palace. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no freedom without Solidarity," Walesa said at the beginning of a 
brief speech explaining why the opposition had approved the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the round-table talks can become the beginning of the road to 
democracy and a free Poland, and hence we look with boldness and hope into the 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Walesa was asked earlier today when he thinks Solidarity will be 
legalized, he replied, "I think immediately after signing." 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak opened the meeting with a speech lauding the talks that brought 
together all sides of the nation's splintered political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"This documentation is a social contract," he said. "We declare the will to 
fulfill honestly the agreement we symbolically conclude today." 
</P>
<P>
He called the debates a "first, extremely significant step" and said the talks 
can be "a priceless element in the accomplishment of our work." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was preceded by separate signings of agreements on economic, 
political and trade union reforms by the opposition and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
As early as this morning it had not been clear whether Solidarity intended to 
sign the accords, especially after a dispute with the officially backed OPZZ 
trade unions over the formula adopted for compensating workers for inflation as 
part of the economic agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Walesa told the National Executive Commission of Solidarity during a 
closed-door, three-hour meeting that the union has achieved its main goal in 
the talks -- legalization -- and that it can better fight for further economic 
and political reforms after it is registered and organized. 
</P>
<P>
The Executive Commission authorized Walesa to sign the agreements, clearing the 
final hurdle to the round-table meeting with Kiszcak.

The California Democrats blamed the Reagan Administration for what they called 
a cover-up and asked President Bush to cancel further oil leasing off the 
California coast pending a complete review of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Levine released internal memoranda from the Reagan Administration on the 
proposed lease sale in Northern California that he said revealed the likelihood

FCC CHAIRMAN WHO CAUSED STATIC WITH CONGRESS RESIGNS

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Dennis R. Patrick has submitted his 
resignation to the White House but will remain in his post until a replacement 
is named, the agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick's resignation had been widely expected after the Bush Administration 
came into office. The controversial former California attorney had battled 
frequently with Congress on his deregulatory approach during his two years as 
head of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
A replacement for Patrick, 37, was not immediately announced. 
</P>
<P>
FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said Patrick hand-carried the letter of 
resignation to the White House on Tuesday. Patrick gave the letter to Chase 
Untermeyer, who is White House personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
A number of names have been mentioned as possible replacements for Patrick, 
including Sherrie Marshall, a former Patrick aide at the FCC who was on loan to 
the White House during the unsuccessful confirmation proceedings for Defense 
Secretary-designate John Tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Replacements 
</P>
<P>
Washington attorneys Susan Wing and Jim Smith have also been mentioned, along 
with Alfred Sikes, head of the Commerce Department's National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick's term was to run until June, 1992. He was named an FCC commissioner in 
December, 1983, after working in the White House personnel office. He succeeded 
former FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the FCC has repealed the Fairness Doctrine that required 
broadcasters to air programs on controversial issues, and it dramatically 
changed the way in which the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. establishes 
its long-distance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick more than two years ago proposed the so-called price cap plan for 
AT&amp;T to replace the FCC's 20-year-old rate-of-return regulatory philosophy, 
and he succeeded in having the commission adopt it last month after a steady 
war of words with critics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deregulatory Approach 
</P>
<P>
Under Patrick, the commission also has moved to change the way broadcasters are 
licensed and generally has followed the deregulatory approach that was 
established during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has been at less than full strength since early last year. 
Nominations to fill the vacant two seats on the five-member commission had been 
held up because of Senate displeasure with Patrick's policies. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response to Patrick's resignation from fellow 
Commissioners James H. Quello and Patricia Diaz Dennis.

Oil and entertainment mogul Marvin Davis, attempting to take over Northwest 
Airlines, has promised to keep the carrier's headquarters in Minnesota, retain 
its managers and employees and expand its routes. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Northwest's Board of Directors released today, Davis said his 
takeover "would be a positive step for the management and employees of the 
company, as well as for the citizens of the communities in which NWA operates, 
particularly the citizens of Minnesota."

The promises came one day after Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich pledged a united 
effort by state officials and union leaders to try to stop Davis from taking 
over NWA Inc., Northwest's parent company based in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said a takeover by Davis, who has offered $2.6 billion, or $90 a 
share, for NWA Inc., might lead to the breakup of the airline and cost the 
state thousands of jobs and the airline's Twin Cities hub, devastating the 
state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Davis said he was prepared to increase his offer in negotiations 
and also claimed that he could finance the acquisition without the sale of any 
of NWA's strategic assets.

Public affairs programming on television has decreased by more than half in the 
last 10 years as a result of deregulation by the Federal Communications 
Commission, says a public interest group started by Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Essential Information, said there has been a 51% decrease in 
issues-oriented public affairs TV programs since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The group called for re-establishment of the FCC's Fairness Doctrine, which the 
agency repealed in 1987, and for a return of so-called 5-5-10 rules that 
required broadcasters to devote certain percentages of their broadcasting hours 
to non-entertainment programming. 
</P>
<P>
The report, by Jim Donahue, was attacked immediately by broadcasters and by an 
FCC official who said the results were "incredible." 
</P>
<P>
John Kamp, an FCC spokesman, said the report "sounds terribly bogus." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Fairness Doctrine, Kamp said the "commission found that it decreased 
the amount of public interest programming available . . . which was the 
opposite of what it was intended to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rogue Agency' 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Nader said the FCC under Chairman Dennis R. Patrick and 
his predecessor, Mark S. Fowler, was a "rogue agency that has dangerously 
transformed power from the public to private commerce in sheer violation of the 
(1934 Communications Act)." 
</P>
<P>
Nader said the FCC believed that marketplace pressures would force station 
owners to broadcast issues-oriented programs. 
</P>
<P>
That has not happened, Nader said, and the FCC refuses "to respect the access 
rights, the response rights of the audience." 
</P>
<P>
The study by Essential Information, which Nader founded in 1982, examined TV 
listings for programs at 217 stations in 50 markets on seven days in early 
1988.

<P>
A tentative contract has been reached with the union representing vendors at 
the Oakland Coliseum, averting a strike today at the second game between the 
Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the settlement reached Tuesday night between Local 28 of the Hotel 
and Restaurant Employees Union and Canteen-Volume Service were not made public, 
pending a ratification vote by workers later today, union spokesman Lincoln 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum food stand managers with a year's experience currently make $9.17 an 
hour compared with $12.90 hourly for similar managers at Candlestick Park in 
San Francisco. Coliseum fry cooks get $9.73 hourly. Candlestick cooks get $9.71 
to $11.37. 
</P>
<P>
A threatened walkout by the 350-member union on opening night Monday was 
avoided when the union agreed not to strike while talks continued with 
Chicago-based Canteen-Volume Service.

LYLE PREPARES TO DEFEND HIS MASTERS TITLE

<P>
Sandy Lyle of Scotland is rested and loose as he prepares to defend his Masters 
golf championship. But he does have one concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to make a fool of myself shooting 84 the first day," Lyle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle spent the last two weeks in London honing his game under the guidance of 
his father, Alex. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing fairly well," he said. "It'll get better as the weeks go along. At 
the moment I'm hitting a lot of good shots on the range but not on the golf 
course. I've still got a couple of days to work." 
</P>
<P>
Lyle will try to become only the second player to repeat as champion when the 
53rd Masters gets under way Thursday with an international field of 86 players. 
Jack Nicklaus included successive titles in 1965 and 1966 among his record six 
Masters championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It just means you've got everything to do again," Lyle said of his role as the 
defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
No one has established himself as a clear-cut favorite to claim the green coat 
that goes to the player who carves out the best score for 72 holes on the 
storied Augusta National Golf Club course, a 6,905-yard, par-72 layout. 
</P>
<P>
British odds makers have made Seve Ballesteros of Spain, a two-time champion, 
and Greg Norman of Australia, one of the top players in the world who hasn't 
won at Augusta, 8-1 favorites. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange, the first player to win $1 million in a 
season on the PGA Tour, doing it last year, was 12-1, and Lyle and Mark 
Calcavecchia, last year's runner-up, were 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros finished third at Houston last week, only his fourth event in the 
United States this season.

All-America baseball player John Olerud of Washington State University has 
returned to practice for the first time since undergoing surgery in late 
February for an aneurysm at the base of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Olerud, a junior pitcher and first-baseman, took hitting practice with the team 
Tuesday and did some light conditioning. He is seeking to regain the form that 
earned him Player of the Year honors from Baseball America magazine last 
season, when he compiled a 15-0 pitching record and led WSU in hitting with a 
.464 average. 
</P>
<P>
Olerud might be back in action later this collegiate season, which ends in late 
May, but realistically said he hopes to be ready for the summer league.

THEIR DREAMHOUSE IS NEIGHBORS' NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When they lived in Kiev, Natalia and Leonid Glosman felt lucky to have an 
apartment of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, nobody has a house," said Leonid Glosman, a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
But after they moved to America 15 years ago, the former Soviet citizens 
prospered. Between dentistry and real estate holdings, they did well enough to 
dream of building a French Baroque mansion in the heights above Sunset 
Boulevard, a house inspired by one of Italian architect Giovanni Bernini's 
early designs for the east wing of the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
They even bought the lot last year, paying $2.2 million for a steep, 
30,145-square-foot hilltop site at the upper end of Laurel Way in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And they hired an architect to translate the majestic lines meant for the 
palace of French kings into a 10,000-square-foot abode with a view of Century 
City. 
</P>
<P>
But their dream collided with neighbors' views -- not only views of the city 
but views of what houses should look like and how big they should be. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors found an audience at City Hall, where the case offered an 
opportunity to test the city's new hillside development ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance requires that the Beverly Hills Planning Commission take note of 
neighbors' views and the scale and integrity of the hillside area when it 
reviews applications for development permits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Consideration 
</P>
<P>
The commission has considered the Glosmans' house almost monthly since August, 
devoting more time to it than to any other case. Finally, the commission voted 
down the Glosmans' plans. It was a 4-0 decision, a message to anyone 
contemplating ambitious projects in the high-priced suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The Glosmans' dream house is "awfully big," declared MeraLee Goldman, chairman 
of the Planning Commission. "It's looming. It's dominating. It's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Remembering her own early days in Beverly Hills, when horse paths still 
followed the curves of Sunset Boulevard, Goldman said the time has come to stop 
the trend toward building bigger houses. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, a three-story Greco-Roman pile that rises above a hillside full of 
low-slung California ranch homes, looms next door to the Glosmans' lot. Two 
more big new houses, approved before the city enacted the special ordinance to 
limit the bulk of hillside construction, are being built across the street. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming up to the wire on this issue. We have lost many of the amenities 
but we have kept the greenery," Goldman said. "These hillsides are a tremendous 
resource. They are the 'hills' of Beverly Hills. We are not going to rape the 
hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pool, Tennis Court 
</P>
<P>
The commission devoted two full hours to the Glosmans' case. It was a testy, 
sometimes emotional exchange as rival lawyers goaded each other with nasty 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Natalia Glosman, who helps in her husband's dental office, said she is a 
working mother and needs a swimming pool and a tennis court so that her 
children will not have to play in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Francine Browner responded passionately: "It may be a big shock to 
Mrs. Glosman, but not every working mother in America needs a tennis court and 
all these sporting facilities. I'm tired of hearing about her children. I have 
children too." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman told her to stick to the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Laurel Way neighborhood said that grading work to lower the 
house's profile and to make room for a tennis court would undermine the 
hillside. They said the French Baroque style would clash with their California 
ranch houses. And they accused the Glosmans' architect of cheating on his 
drawings to make the house look smaller. He denied it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropped Waterfall 
</P>
<P>
The Glosmans said they gave up their dreams of a waterfall and a pool house. 
They said they turned the house to reduce its bulk when seen from the street. 
And they said they picked the site for the tennis court at the suggestion of 
neighbors so as not to block the neighbors' view. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tricked," Natalia Glosman said. "This is worse than Russia. This is a 
dictatorship of the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
"There doesn't seem to be a lot of good faith on either side," commented Jerry 
Magnin, a commission member. 
</P>
<P>
Although she decided against the proposal in the end, Goldman said she was 
personally disappointed that the opponents were unable to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want the neighbors to dictate how a house will look. It's not fair," 
she said. But she added: "It's also not fair to come in and change the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The Glosmans, who own a house not far from Laurel Way, said they have not 
decided what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
Their case may go to the City Council for review, but only if the City Council 
wants to review it. They can turn to the courts, but the time and money needed 
may be prohibitive, said their attorney, Joseph N. Tillem. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the residents around Laurel Way can enjoy their view, Tillem said. But 
if no one can build a big, new, stylish house there, maybe no one will want to 
buy into the neighborhood at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate irony is that someday these very neighbors are going to want to 
sell their home for the best price they can get, and this will hurt their 
chance to get full value for their home," Tillem said.

REORGANIZATION OF PANEL WINS 1ST VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave first approval to a major 
committee reorganization designed to increase council supervision over such 
issues as housing, redevelopment and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the proposal by Council President John Ferraro sent it to the city 
attorney's office, where it is to be drafted into final form and reshaped 
slightly to meet objections voiced during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The main objection came from Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who felt Los Angeles 
International Airport, which is in her district, should be under the 
jurisdiction of the committee in charge of transportation. Under the Ferraro 
plan, it is lumped together with the harbor and the Department of Water and 
Power.
