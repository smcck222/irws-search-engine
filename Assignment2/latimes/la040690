S. AFRICA, ANC TO RESCHEDULE STALLED TALKS 
</P>

<P>
In discussions between South Africa's two most important opponents, President 
Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Nelson R. 
Mandela agreed Thursday night to reschedule talks that had been suspended by 
the ANC in protest over police killings of black demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The peace process "is on course again," De Klerk declared after a three-hour 
meeting with Mandela at the presidential offices. It was the first formal 
contact between a free ANC leader and a South African president in at least 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, at a separate news conference, described the meeting as "cordial, 
pleasant . . . and productive. We think, broadly speaking, we have been able to 
make very good progress and we are hopeful further meetings also will be 
productive." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and De Klerk, each assisted by three senior aides, agreed on a new date 
for initial ANC-government talks. The ANC said the date will be announced as 
soon as Mandela reports back to the ANC's national executive committee in 
Lusaka, Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to open formal channels of communication that would, 
in De Klerk's words, "eliminate misunderstandings" between the ANC and the 
government in the future. Neither De Klerk nor Mandela would specify what those 
arrangements entailed. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's efforts to unify anti-apartheid forces for eventual negotiations also 
were bolstered Thursday when four of the six leaders of South Africa's 
self-governing black homelands pulled out of separate talks with De Klerk, and 
the leader of one of the country's four nominally independent black homelands, 
Venda, was overthrown in a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
Only two homeland leaders -- Kwazulu chief minister Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi 
and Qwaqwa chief minister Kenneth Mopeli -- turned up for their scheduled 
meeting with De Klerk. The government accused the ANC of intimidating the other 
homeland leaders, and De Klerk criticized Mandela, saying that "no leader 
should in any way whatsoever try to inhibit discussion." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I'm going to be intimidated by any bullying," said Buthelezi, 
whose supporters have been engaged in a bloody war with the ANC-aligned United 
Democratic Front in Natal province. And Buthelezi said that "just because I'm 
here," meeting with De Klerk, doesn't mean "I'm aligning myself with the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela denied any ANC intimidation of the homeland leaders, contending that 
the four leaders had already made up their minds to boycott talks with De Klerk 
when they briefed the ANC on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The resurrected government-ANC talks, originally scheduled for next Thursday, 
will center on obstacles to formal negotiations. The ANC has refused to accept 
De Klerk's invitation to negotiate a new constitution until the government 
lifts the 46-month-old state of emergency, releases political prisoners, ends 
political prosecutions and allows exiles free passage home. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the primary black opposition group in South Africa, had suspended 
arrangements for those preliminary talks in protest over a March 26 clash 
between police and demonstrators in Sebokeng, about 25 miles south of 
Johannesburg. Police opened fire on tens of thousands of blacks protesting poor 
living conditions in that township, killing five. At least 10 other deaths 
occurred in rioting and additional clashes with police later that day. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC had demanded a government response to the "massacre of innocent and 
defenseless people in Sebokeng." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk met that demand Thursday by assuring Mandela that he had already 
ordered "an in-depth investigation" into the police actions in Sebokeng. The 
president also said he would consider appointing a judicial commission of 
inquiry into the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he welcomed De Klerk's moves but added that he had told the 
president that any commission of inquiry "must consist of people regarded as 
credible leaders" in the black community. "The perception that exists, 
especially among blacks in the country, is that a white judge is not the right 
person to head such an inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting of the two leaders since Mandela was released from 
prison Feb. 11. They conferred twice while Mandela was a prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was joined in the discussions by Popo Molefe, general secretary of the 
UDF anti-apartheid coalition; Trevor Manuel, ANC leader in the western Cape 
province, and Ahmed Kathrada, a Mandela co-defendant in the 1964 treason trial 
and now part of the ANC's internal leadership. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was assisted by Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, the foreign minister; Gerrit 
Viljoen, minister of constitutional development, and Adriaan Vlok, minister of 
law and order. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that escalating violence across the country, especially in 
Natal province where factional fighting has claimed more than 2,500 lives in 
the last three years, is a major impediment to fruitful black-white 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But they disagreed about the cause of that violence. De Klerk suggested that 
much of it was spawned by the ANC's refusal to end its support for the armed 
struggle it has waged against Pretoria's white minority-led government for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC contends that the armed struggle cannot be ended until the government 
stops using violence against anti-apartheid demonstrators. And Mandela blamed 
the violence in South Africa on the system of racial repression that has left 
the black majority impoverished and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
The government's desire to open power-sharing talks with black opposition 
groups has triggered increasing violence in South Africa's 10 homelands, which 
were created under apartheid to keep blacks away from white areas. Many 
residents of the four homelands that Pretoria considers independent are 
pressing their leaders to return the territories to South African rule. 
</P>
<P>
A coup last month toppled the leader of Ciskei, one of the four independent 
homelands. And on Thursday, Venda President Frank Ravele, the leader of another 
of those independent homelands, was overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
News of the coup was greeted with singing and dancing in the streets, news 
agencies reported. In an address on Radio Thohoyandou, coup leader Col. Gabriel 
Ramushwana, deputy chief of the Venda Defense Force, said he would lead the 
2,578-square-mile territory until it is incorporated into South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear these (homeland) leaders have no support," Mandela said. And 
while the ANC is willing to forget the past, he warned that "discredited 
homeland leaders" who are attempting to maintain their power despite public 
disapproval "will not be able to run to us for protection."

USD CALLS OFF EVENT BECAUSE KILLEA IS INVITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Administrators at the University of San Diego canceled an on-campus political 
conference last month because of their concern that state Sen. Lucy Killea's 
involvement would be an affront to Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher, whose clash 
with Killea over the abortion issue generated a national controversy last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The March 16-18 conference, which was to have been co-sponsored by USD's 
political sciences department and a La Jolla consulting firm, was scrapped the 
week before because of university leaders' concern that Killea's planned 
appearance would be "inappropriate," a university spokesman said Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
During last fall's campaign, Maher denied Killea Communion rights because of 
the San Diego Democrat's advocacy of abortion rights -- igniting a political 
and religious firestorm that figured prominently in her upset victory. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, officials at the Catholic university told organizer Brenda Kinnaman 
that the three-day meeting on campaign tactics could not be held as planned at 
USD's Douglas Manchester Conference Center because of a last-minute scheduling 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting USD officials' suggestion that the event be moved off campus, 
Kinnaman tried to reschedule it in late April at the university. Faced with 
that prospect, USD officials dramatically changed their story, admitting that 
the March conference had been scuttled, not by a schedule conflict, but by 
university leaders' discomfort over Killea's inclusion among the speakers. 
Moreover, as long as Killea remained part of the program, officials told 
Kinnaman, the conference would not be welcome at USD. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released late Thursday night, prompted by earlier inquiries from 
The Times, the university said: "USD felt an appearance by state Sen. Lucy 
Killea, given the events of last fall's election, would be perceived by the 
public as an affront to Bishop Maher and was, therefore, inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Though Kinnaman said she has been told privately by USD officials that Maher 
vehemently objected to Killea's role in the conference, Arts and Sciences Dean 
Pat Drinan insisted that Maher "exerted no pressure at all," either in trying 
to have Killea removed from the program or in canceling the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, USD President Author Hughes, in consultation with political science 
department head Virginia Muller, decided to cancel the conference "as a matter 
of courtesy" to Maher, Drinan said. Maher could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"President Hughes approached the bishop, not the other way around," Drinan 
said. "It was thought that, with Bishop Maher only a few months away from 
retirement, Sen. Killea's participation . . . could have been seen as an 
unnecessary embarrassment. That's what we wanted to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Describing herself as "a little disappointed but not really offended," Killea, 
who received a master's degree at USD, said the university's objections were 
privately conveyed to her by a friend in the administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really look upon the conference as an olive branch, but I thought, 
well, maybe this will help us get back to normal business and put this other 
stuff behind us," Killea said. "Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
During last December's special 39th state Senate District campaign, Maher's 
sanction against Killea catapulted the otherwise obscure state legislative 
contest to national prominence -- reviving, in the process, the familiar debate 
over separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Killea, 67, "an advocate of this most heinous crime," Maher ordered her 
not to take Communion unless she recanted her support for legalized abortion -- 
something that the then four-term Assemblywoman refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
Though Maher called his action "more pastoral than political," he readily 
acknowledged that he hoped his message would cost Killea votes in her race 
against Republican Carol Bentley. Far from damaging Killea, however, Maher's 
action transformed the unassuming, low-key legislator into a nationwide 
celebrity, acting as a magnet for dollars and volunteers that helped produce a 
razor-thin 50.6%-49.4% victory. 
</P>
<P>
Maher, who is scheduled to step down as head of the San Diego diocese in July 
when he reaches the church's mandatory retirement age of 75, is head of USD's 
board of trustees. The final decision about the conference, however, rested 
with Hughes. Privately, some USD professors have complained that the event's 
cancellation raises serious questions about academic independence at the 
university, the site of the diocesan headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say how this might be perceived," Drinan said. "It is 
inherently a murky situation. We tried to clean it up, but it ended up getting 
a little messy." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the university's initial explanation that the conference's 
cancellation stemmed from a double-booking oversight created confusion and 
misunderstanding on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
Drinan conceded Thursday night that available space was not the problem but 
resisted characterizing the admittedly false explanation as a cover story 
designed to conceal the real reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is as much a cover story as it was a legitimate method of 
trying to find a way out of this that didn't cause embarrassment," Drinan said. 
"We tried to finesse the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Kinnaman, a fund-raiser in Killea's race last December, said she doubts that 
the true story behind the cancellation would have come out had she not pursued 
her efforts to reschedule the event on the USD campus. About 200 people had 
reserved places at the conference, which will be held in July at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it looked like Lucy might have trouble clearing her schedule, so I 
think they thought, 'All right! We're home free!' " Kinnaman said. "But, when I 
told them Lucy would be able to do it, they were forced to 'fess up and level 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Killea offered similar remarks in downplaying her feelings about the awkward 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have any personal resentment over it," Killea said. "If the 
concern was that I might embarrass them by bringing up the bishop's action 
(barring her from receiving Communion), that's not something I would do. I 
wasn't going to raise the issue independently. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my feeling is just that the bishop's been left far behind in what's 
happening today. But that will work itself out. Time will take care of that."

LEGISLATORS BACK TOUGH ETHICS BILL; 
</P>
<P>
STATE GOVERNMENT: CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST PENALTIES ARE PART OF THE LANDMARK 
PACKAGE. IT IS TIED TO VOTER APPROVAL OF PAY-RAISE LEGISLATION.

<P>
Seeking to boost the Legislature's sagging public image, top state lawmakers 
agreed Thursday on a landmark package of new ethical standards, including the 
first conflict-of-interest penalties for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Billed by supporters as one of the toughest ethics codes in the nation, the 
legislation would also ban outside speaking fees for legislators, place a $250 
limit on gifts, and restrict lobbying by ex-officials. These three provisions, 
however, would take effect only if voters approve a June 5 ballot measure 
paving the way for a legislative pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
In a significant departure from existing laws, the bipartisan proposal also 
would make it a crime for a member of the State Board of Equalization who 
accepts $250 or more from a campaign donor to vote on any matter -- such as a 
tax break -- affecting the contributor. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was spurred in large part by the recent conviction of 
then-state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya and the indictment of former state Sen. Paul 
Carpenter -- now a member of the Board of Equalization -- on a variety of 
political corruption charges. A Los Angeles Times poll in January showed that 
most voters believe it is a common practice for legislators to take bribes. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of public debate and back-room negotiations, the ethics 
package was approved unanimously by a two-house conference committee that 
included the Legislature's highest leaders -- signaling that the measure is 
almost certain to win approval from both the Senate and the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major step forward as far as ethics reform in the state Legislature and 
I think it's a model for all legislatures," said Senate President Pro Tem David 
A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who chaired the committee. "Basic remuneration has 
to come from the people so there is no conflict of interest in who a legislator 
is beholden to." 
</P>
<P>
But some critics of the measure contended that it is flawed and does not go far 
enough in curbing abuses. For example, they pointed out, the bill still would 
allow legislators to receive thousands of dollars in free trips. Others argued 
that the bill's conflict-of-interest provisions are too weak and that local 
elected officials who vote to benefit their own financial interests face much 
stricter penalties. 
</P>
<P>
ntil now, it has been against the law for legislators to engage in votes that 
constitute a conflict of interest, but the law has been irrelevant because 
there is no penalty. Under the bill, legislators who vote to enrich themselves 
would be subject to a fine of up to $2,000. Local officials, on the other hand, 
already can be charged with a misdemeanor or fined three times the amount of 
money they have gained as a result of their improper vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we don't make the mistake of pretending this bill is more than it is," 
said Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who also served on 
the committee. "This proposal has several loopholes and omissions that could 
have, and should have, been corrected in this committee." 
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to secure a pay increase for legislators, some of the most 
significant elements of the ethics plan are tied to Proposition 112 on the June 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the voters, Proposition 112 would create a commission with the 
power to set new salaries for legislators, who complain that they now receive 
only $40,816 a year plus a tax-free expense allowance and a state-subsidized 
car. At the same time, the proposed constitutional amendment would require the 
Legislature to impose stricter ethical standards on its members. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and the citizens' lobbying group Common Cause had urged legislators to 
enact such legislation before June so that voters would know precisely what 
ethics measures would take effect if they vote for Proposition 112. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation approved Thursday by Roberti, Johnson, Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) and other leaders from both parties includes a wide 
range of measures. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would prohibit legislators from accepting outside speaking fees or 
other cash payments that are commonly known as honorariums. The practice of 
accepting honorariums from special-interest groups has been widely criticized, 
particularly since Montoya was videotaped accepting a $3,000 payment from an 
undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to set a limit of $250 on gifts to legislators from a 
single source each year. However, certain free trips sponsored by 
special-interest groups would be allowed, such as travel within the United 
States to give a speech. 
</P>
<P>
rown had initially balked at voting for the legislation, complaining that it 
would prohibit him from accepting free tickets to such events as the Academy 
Awards and the Super Bowl. But ultimately he agreed to support the ethics 
package, noting that he could pay for his own tickets if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legislation would prohibit legislators and top government 
officials from lobbying their former colleagues for 12 months after leaving 
office. 
</P>
<P>
All three of these provisions -- the ban on speaking fees, the limit on gifts 
and the restrictions on lobbying -- would take effect only if voters approve 
Proposition 112. 
</P>
<P>
However, the conflict-of-interest provisions affecting legislators and the 
Board of Equalization would become law regardless of the vote on the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The provision affecting the Board of Equalization marks the first time the 
Legislature will treat a campaign contribution as a payment that can result in 
a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the board, who often decide tax appeals for individual corporate 
taxpayers, could face criminal prosecution and ouster from office if they voted 
on a matter benefiting a campaign contributor. 
</P>
<P>
James Wheaton, executive director of Common Cause, praised the legislative 
leadership for approving the ethics package and urged voters to pass 
Proposition 112. 
</P>
<P>
"This is landmark legislation," Wheaton said. "It is the first step to wean 
legislators from the flow of special-interest dollars." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The ethics measure next goes to the Senate and Assembly. If it receives 
approval as expected in both houses, it will be sent to Gov. George Deukmejian 
for his signature. Major portions of the legislation would take effect only if 
the voters approve Proposition 112 on the June ballot. The new ethics standards 
would take effect Jan. 1, 1991.

LITHUANIA SENDS A CONCILIATORY NOTE TO MOSCOW 
</P>

<P>
The Lithuanian Parliament, in a conciliatory message to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, declared its readiness on Thursday to discuss its 
decision to secede from the Soviet Union within the context of the Soviet 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"We propose to have as soon as possible preliminary, bilateral consultations 
with the goal of clarifying the positions of both sides on the problems of 
mutual interest," the Lithuanian Supreme Council said in reply to an appeal by 
Gorbachev last weekend to annul its unilateral declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, the resolution continued, "is ready to discuss through dialogue the 
essence and letter of the acts and resolutions adopted by the Supreme Council 
of the Republic of Lithuania from the point of view of international law and 
the constitution of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
While the resolution did not back away from Lithuania's March 11 declaration of 
independence from the Soviet Union, the willingness to discuss the issue within 
the Soviet constitutional context was a major step toward meeting Moscow's 
conditions for resolution of the secession crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as important was the Lithuanian proposal for "consultations," rather 
than the "negotiations" that the breakaway republic had demanded previously, 
and the resolution stressed the desire for "dialogue" and a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
Both issues -- on what basis the talks would be held and how they might be 
described -- are sensitive for they involve the fundamental question of 
Lithuania's sovereignty, the constitutionality of its secession from the Soviet 
Union and Gorbachev's determination to uphold the country's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told a press conference in Vilnius, 
the capital, that the declaration of independence itself remained 
non-negotiable. "We are ready to discuss everything but our independence," 
Landsbergis asserted, as he has many times before. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council's resolution, adopted after prolonged debate, also 
underscored Lithuania's unwillingness to negotiate under what it regards as 
military pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania, as before, is prepared for honest dialogue, but this should not be 
accompanied by the willful actions of your armed forces," the council said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 armed Soviet soldiers dressed as police officers took over the 
Lithuanian state prosecutor's office earlier Thursday, expelling most of its 
employees and taking up positions on each floor, a Lithuanian government 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kazimieras Motieka, deputy head of the Lithuanian Parliament, said that the 
soldiers, carrying boxes of ammunition and other supplies, apparently were 
being deployed as a prelude to a complete takeover of the chief prosecutor's 
office by the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow officials have tried to dismiss the prosecutor appointed by the 
Lithuanian Parliament and install their own nominee, contending that the post 
is a federal, not a republic, appointment. Lithuanian employees have refused to 
obey the Moscow appointee, and several soldiers were stationed in the building 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred one day after Lithuania's secessionist government accused 
the Kremlin of backing forces bent on its overthrow and again heightened 
tensions in Vilnius. The Soviet Parliament ruled the Lithuanian declaration of 
independence invalid, and Gorbachev has used his new executive powers to put 
more and more pressure on Lithuania to rescind the action. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president warned Lithuanians last weekend of "grave consequences for 
us all" unless they annulled their declaration of independence, and that was 
followed by a further military buildup in Vilnius and outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
This led to a sharp debate within the Supreme Council through much of the week 
over the wording of the resolution replying to Gorbachev. Hard-liners wanted to 
drop the conciliatory tone of the initial Lithuanian response; other deputies 
wanted to be even more forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that Lithuania's determination to rejoin the family of independent 
states creates concerns for the Soviet Union and for you personally," the 
deputies told Gorbachev in the milder resolution that was eventually adopted, 
91-0 with seven abstentions. "You correctly assess the situation as complex, 
demanding well-based discussions and acceptable decisions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that you, esteemed president, will prefer a political solution of 
the problem to all others. In view of this, the Supreme Council of the Republic 
of Lithuania once again affirms its readiness to enter a dialogue and discuss 
measures of establishing new relations between our states." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the chief Lithuanian representative in the Soviet capital said that 
the republic's leadership would agree to a referendum on independence as 
demanded by the central government as well as by Lithuania's Russian and Polish 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people demand it, if someone wants a special confirmation of some sort, 
then the Supreme Council could take such a decision," Egidius Bickauskas, the 
Lithuanian envoy, told reporters. "We would see this as a referendum on the 
decisions taken by the Supreme Council." 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania is prepared to "abandon or suspend any of its decisions" except the 
independence declaration, and the Kremlin should understand that it is 
impossible for the republic to go back on this question, Bickauskas said. What 
is negotiable here, he said, is the timetable and framework for its 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something for the Moscow leadership to think about," Bickauskas said. 
"But the leadership will have to make the tiniest step forward toward our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
While Landsbergis continues to maintain that the overwhelming pro-independence 
vote in the republic's parliamentary elections in February gave the leadership 
a full mandate for independence and amounted to a referendum, he said Thursday 
that a referendum would be acceptable to confirm or ratify the actions of the 
Supreme Council. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted in Lithuania showed that 91% of respondents backed 
the independence declaration, according to results released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Algimantas Cekoilis, a leading figure in the Lithuanian nationalist 
movement Sajudis, said the republic will offer further concessions to get 
formal talks started with Moscow as soon as possible, according to the 
Associated Press. In addition to a referendum, they include: 
</P>
<P>
Recognition of Soviet interests, but not rights, in the Baltic states, "maybe 
including a military presence." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet access to the Soviet city of Kaliningrad, the former German city of 
Koenigsberg, from which it would lose direct land access. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet use of the Baltic seaports, which are important to the Soviet navy. 
</P>
<P>
Continuation of the present economic relations between Lithuania and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Cekoilis told a London news conference that Landsbergis had authorized him to 
publicize the proposed concessions in the West to gain greater international 
attention for them. 
</P>
<P>
But Edward Tuskenis of the Lithuanian Parliament's information office said that 
Cekoilis may have "overstepped his bounds" by setting out a position that had 
not been fully approved by the Lithuanian government.

DEATH SENTENCE UPHELD FOR KILLER OF THERAPIST'S HUSBAND 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court, upholding the right to self-representation in capital 
cases, on Thursday affirmed the death sentence of a Canoga Park man for the 
bizarre arson-killing of his former mental therapist's husband in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-2 decision, the court rejected an appeal from William John Clark, 45, 
convicted of the murder of David Gawronski and the attempted murder of his 
wife, Ava, a psychiatric social worker who lost her fingers and nose and 
received other serious injuries when Clark threw gasoline on the couple's home 
and set it ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had been briefly hospitalized as a college student for psychiatric 
treatment, claimed he had planned to set the fire to force the Gawronskis to 
flee and then shoot the husband before his wife's horrified eyes. Clark said 
his motive was to make Ava Gawronski suffer for abruptly terminating her 
counseling of him after he threatened to rape her. 
</P>
<P>
The justices turned down Clark's claim that he was entitled to a new penalty 
trial because he was improperly allowed to represent himself at trial. The high 
court, citing previous state and federal court rulings, said mentally competent 
defendants must be granted requests to represent themselves even in capital 
cases -- and cannot complain later that they were denied their constitutional 
right to "effective assistance" of counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant has the right to present no defense and to take the stand and 
both confess guilt and request imposition of the death penalty," Justice David 
N. Eagleson wrote for the majority. "It follows that the state's interest in 
ensuring a reliable penalty determination may not be urged as a basis for 
denying the capital defendant his fundamental right to control his defense by 
representing himself at all stages of the trial." 
</P>
<P>
Before the trial, Clark was examined by a psychiatrist and a psychologist and 
neither concluded that he was insane or suffering from a mental disorder. Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Harry Mock Jr. noted that Clark, a college 
graduate with honors, was well-educated and articulate and ruled he was 
mentally competent to waive his right to counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also ruled that Clark's setting fire to the victims' home 
constituted a separate act of arson committed for the independent purpose of 
forcing the family from the home. Thus, the court said, that act could serve as 
a basis for imposing the death penalty for the killing of Gawronski. Under 
state law, defendants may be sentenced to death for a killing that takes place 
in commission of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
In a sharp dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk said Clark should not have been 
permitted to represent himself. "The bizarre nature of the crime and the 
irrational reasons motivating the defendant to commit the offense should have 
alerted the (trial) court to the mental inability of the defendant to 
adequately present evidence in mitigation," Mosk wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The justice pointed out that at Clark's first trial, when he was represented by 
a lawyer, the jury found him guilty but deadlocked in the penalty phase of the 
case. Clark then fired his lawyer and represented himself in the penalty 
retrial in which he was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
In another dissent, Justice Allen E. Broussard, joined by Mosk, said that Clark 
should not have been eligible for a death sentence under the felony-murder rule 
because in this instance, setting the fire was not a separate act but merely 
part of the plan to kill Gawronski. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Josanna Berkow welcomed the ruling, saying it 
strengthened previous decisions that rejected appeals from defendants who 
represented themselves at trial. "This was a horrendous crime, committed with a 
great deal of planning and careful thought," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer representing Clark on appeal was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, an insurance underwriter, had received psychiatric treatment in his 20s 
but discontinued the therapy when he married in 1968. In 1979, the couple 
separated and began receiving counseling from Ava Gawronski, a licensed 
therapist and marriage counselor. Later, when Clark indicated he intended to 
rape the therapist, she terminated their professional relationship. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Clark made repeated attempts to contact her and 
once forced her automobile off the freeway and used an ice ax to break the 
window glass to talk to her. He left when other motorists interceded. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1981, he was charged with the rape of his former wife. Two months 
later, while awaiting prosecution on those charges and the attempted rape and 
freeway attack on Gawronski, Clark, armed with a shotgun and two buckets of 
gasoline, set fire to the Gawronski home in Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
David Gawronski suffered second- and third-degree burns over 90% of his body 
and died eight days later. Ava Gawronski was hospitalized with serious burns 
for 10 months. The couple's infant daughter, Sara, was rescued by a neighbor 
and escaped injury.

SPRING BRAKE;

<P>
PALM SPRINGS TRIES TO SLOW DOWN STUDENTS' REVELRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's that time of year again -- spring break. Throughout the country, colleges 
and high schools have sprung their restive charges and many are headed, as 
usual, for Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
But beware, would-be revelers, because the desert resort cherished for its 
reliably clear skies and balmy temperatures has a new get-tough policy that 
threatens to take some fun out of this annual exercise in drunken debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
Packing a squirt gun? Think again. Firing the toy could earn you a stiff fine 
-- plus an extra fee of $15 to repay the city for the time it took to ticket 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Planning to cruise Palm Canyon Drive with a Coors in your lap? Watch out. Local 
police -- augmented by scores of officers on loan from other law enforcement 
agencies -- will be ready to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
Pull something really cute and you might have Mayor Sonny Bono -- who has been 
patroling city streets on his snazzy black Harley Davidson -- chasing you down. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of what His Honor describes as an effort by Palm Springs to 
strike back at the April invaders -- a bid by the populace to get away "from 
being total victims of Easter vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Though some merchants who benefit from the hordes of young visitors disagree, 
the mayor believes the spring breakers create a gigantic hassle for residents 
and give little in return: "If I could wave a wand and make it go away," Bono 
declared recently, "I would." 
</P>
<P>
Lacking such a wand, the City Council has been hunting for ways to deter 
miscreant behavior and saddle troublemakers with the growing financial burden 
of enforcing laws during the break. This year, the city will spend $358,000 for 
extra law enforcement help during the April vacation crunch. 
</P>
<P>
In February, city officials considered a proposal to cover the extra police 
costs by increasing the nightly bed tax for hotels and motels by $4 during 
spring break. That idea, however, was quickly attacked by hotel and motel 
owners and scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the council instead approved a novel ordinance allowing 
Palm Springs to charge lawbreakers a special fee for violations occurring 
during a two-week period beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, anyone issued a citation -- for offenses ranging from 
possession of an open alcoholic beverage to heaving a water balloon -- will 
face a fee of $15 on top of whatever penalty is imposed by the court. Those 
arrested and booked into jail will be slapped with a bill of $65. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is, we are collecting a reimbursement from these people for the 
manpower we've expended in ticketing or arresting them," Palm Springs spokesman 
Frank Cullen said. "It's a creative approach." 
</P>
<P>
Violators will have 30 days to cough up the dough or will be referred to a 
collection agency. Based on past arrest and citation figures, city officials 
estimate the fees will allow them to recoup up to $175,000, Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
Other tactics designed to make spring break run smoothly include the erection 
of signs warning motorists not to block intersections and the placement of 
portable toilets at spots where students tend to congregate downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The 80 members of the local police force are sacrificing their days off and 
working 12-hour shifts, and will be joined by nearly 60 officers from the 
Riverside County Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bono, meanwhile, plans to continue roving town on his motorcycle, looking 
for flagrant violators. Last week, Cullen said, Bono pulled up beside a young 
speedster and threatened to jail the startled driver for the night if he didn't 
slow down. 
</P>
<P>
"Sonny is definitely trying to be more visible," Cullen said. "He even 
volunteered for duty in the police motorcycle division, but the chief said they 
had enough people." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, students went on an unprecedented rampage, hurling rocks and bottles 
at police and causing thousands of dollars in damage to Palm Springs' 
commercial area. The following year, city officials responded by beefing up 
police patrols, tightening traffic laws and discouraging liquor stores from 
selling beer in glass bottles. 
</P>
<P>
While few residents dispute Bono's contention that the break is a headache for 
Palm Springs, some folks in the tourist business are a tad uncomfortable with 
the mayor's less-than-hospitable posture. This is a tourist town, and not all 
of the young visitors are rowdy hooligans, these critics point out. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring break does cause a lot of aggravation and extra expense, but I don't 
believe we should be telling these kids to go away," said Erich Langmann, owner 
of the 158-room Travelodge, an affordable inn popular among students. "If the 
city can do something that allows us to replace the kids with senior citizens, 
then fine. But short of that . . . we like the business." 
</P>
<P>
Owners of more upscale hotels, however, counter that the college crowd scares 
off their guests, thereby hurting business during peak weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a case of not liking young people," said Zetta Castle, owner of the 
22-suite L'Horizon Hotel. "They're marvelous. It's just there are such masses 
of them. My guests call ahead and won't come if the streets are crowded and 
they're unable to get to the restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Although the largest influx of revelers is expected to begin arriving today, 
students from schools on different schedules have been vacationing in Palm 
Springs for the last several weeks. Police Lt. Lee Weigel said more than 300 
arrests have been made and more than 1,000 citations issued during the last 
three weekends.

SOVIET CLOWN WANTS TO DEFECT, LAWYER SAYS

A Moscow Circus clown left his Soviet troupe earlier this week in Nevada and is 
seeking asylum in the United States, as well a job with a circus here, an 
attorney who represents him said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The clown, Sergei Uhanov, "is alive and well and happy and he is in the process 
of applying for political asylum," said lawyer Michael Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Ross would not reveal his client's whereabouts, but a San Francisco 
restaurateur said the lawyer and the clown dined in his establishment two 
nights this week. 
</P>
<P>
Uhanov was a member of the Moscow Circus, which had been performing at Bally's 
Casino Resort in Reno. Uhanov was last seen after Sunday night's performance, 
the circus' final one on a U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
When Uhanov failed to make the bus that took the performers to the Reno airport 
Monday, other performers packed his belongings and took them to the airport, 
assuming he would show up late for their flight to New York, according to 
circus promoter Bill Franzblau. 
</P>
<P>
But Uhanov missed the flight, and on Wednesday Franzblau filed a missing 
person's report with the Reno Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The only picture we had (to give police) was of a man with size 22 shoes and a 
big plastic nose," said Franzblau, who is based in New York and organized the 
circus' U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization officials said they had received no asylum 
request from the clown or his lawyer. Spokeswoman Virginia Kice would not say 
whether the would-be defector will have a harder time gaining asylum in this 
era of improved U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"All asylum claims are taken on a case-by-case basis, and we won't comment any 
further," Kice said. 
</P>
<P>
A phone call to the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Franzblau said the troupe came to the United States last November and spent 
three months in Reno and Las Vegas in a tour that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had a problem with Sergei," Franzblau said. "Sergei was always where 
he was supposed to be when he was supposed to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Uhanov was part of a two-clown act. Franzblau said, "His partner knows nothing 
about what might have happened. He is concerned for his friend and for his act. 
Either he has to find a new partner or we have to find a new clown act." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Ross, of Carson City, Nev., would not say how he met Uhanov or where 
the clown would be seeking asylum. He said he plans to keep Uhanov out of the 
limelight until after the legal papers have been filed with the INS. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly we are concerned about his safety," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't know where he will live," the attorney added. "He does want to seek 
work in the United States doing what he did in the circus, which is being a 
clown." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, Lloyd Wiborg, owner of Scott's Seafood restaurant on Lombard, 
not far from the Soviet Consulate, said Ross brought Uhanov into the restaurant 
on Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wiborg said that when Ross told patrons about the clown's plans, "We rallied 
around him, bought him beer, gave him cheers." The restaurateur said he offered 
Uhanov a Bulgarian beer. The clown asked for a Budweiser.

EXPANSION OF MEDFLY SPRAYING ZONE SET; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: PARTS OF ROWLAND HEIGHTS, DIAMOND BAR AND INDUSTRY WILL GET AERIAL 
APPLICATIONS OF MALATHION. TWO OF THE PESTS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE AREA 
RECENTLY.

The state's aerial spraying campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly spread 
Thursday to previously untouched portions of northeast Los Angeles County after 
the discovery of a Medfly in a loquat tree. 
</P>
<P>
The immature female fly was trapped Tuesday in residential Rowland Heights, 
slightly more than a mile away from where another fly was found 2 1/2 weeks ago 
in neighboring Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials announced Thursday that a 16-square-mile sector 
encompassing parts of Rowland Heights, Diamond Bar and Industry will be sprayed 
twice with the pesticide malathion beginning at 10 p.m. next Wednesday. The 
sprayings will be followed in early May with the release of millions of sterile 
Medflies, used to breed the pest out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The new aerial campaign marks the first expansion of the spray zone since 
February and comes just as state agriculture officials are preparing to phase 
out aerial spraying in 366 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange counties by 
May 9. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Magee, associate director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, 
said the new spray zone will not affect the May 9 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"This won't change the deadline or anything else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the state's own scientific advisers are skeptical that the deadline 
can be met. "I've always felt May 9 was extremely, absolutely premature," said 
Richard Rice, a UC Davis entomologist and one of five scientists on the state's 
Medfly Science Advisory Panel. "This is the first of probably many finds. I 
hope that date isn't locked in concrete." 
</P>
<P>
UC Davis entomologist James R. Carey, another member of the panel, said he 
believes the two Medflies found in Rowland Heights and Diamond Bar are only the 
beginning of a spring resurgence of the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Carey said the vast majority of Medflies detected over the last 15 years have 
been found in late summer and early autumn, when the temperature and the 
availability of fruit both peak. 
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery of a Medfly in Rowland Heights confirms his fear that the 
war against the pest, which began last July with the discovery of a single fly 
near Dodger Stadium, has only started. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in deep trouble," Carey said. "This is just the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Word that aerial spraying will soon start in the three communities, located 
about 20 miles east of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Valley, sparked a strong 
reaction from local officials, who have watched with increasing anxiety as the 
state's spraying campaign worked its way around their borders. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar Councilman Paul Horcher said he was prepared for the announcement 
about the start of aerial spraying, but still found it upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting sick of it all. I think the whole valley is," Horcher said. "It's 
clear the citizens here are being used as backstops for mistakes the 
agriculture people have been making. We thought this was wrapping up. I guess 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gary Werner said the announcement of spraying was a frustrating 
development because of the state's apparent inability to control the spread of 
the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Werner was the sponsor of a Diamond Bar City Council resolution last month 
opposing aerial spraying over its territory. The resolution was largely 
symbolic since the city has no authority to stop the state's eradication 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like there's anything we can do about it at this point," 
Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
Magee said the new spray zone will have top priority in receiving the increased 
shipments of sterile flies expected in late April. The balance of the sterile 
flies will be used to phase out aerial spraying in previously infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Science panel members have expressed concern that each new infestation will 
deplete the sterile flies needed to phase out sectors already being sprayed. 
The panel has recommended that spraying in those areas continue rather than be 
disrupted by shifting to the use of sterile flies when eradication is close. 
</P>
<P>
Magee countered that the state expects to have more than enough flies to phase 
out areas now being sprayed and handle new outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take two or three more (infestations) before I start getting 
nervous," Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
The new spray zone is roughly bounded by Valley Boulevard on the north, Nogales 
Street on the west, the Diamond Bar city limits on the south and Derringer Lane 
on the east.

POLICE CORDON OFF SQUARE IN BEIJING, DETER PROTESTS;

CHINA: BUT ON THE DAY TO MOURN THE DEAD, A FEW BRAVE ACTS RECALL THOSE KILLED 
IN LAST YEAR'S CRACKDOWN.

<P>
Strict security deterred any major protests Thursday on the traditional day to 
mourn the dead, but with tiny acts of individual bravery, some Beijing 
residents honored those killed in last June's crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the main part of Tian An Men Square throughout the day and 
late into the evening, while officially sponsored events were taking place at 
what was the center of last year's massive protests. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents abroad and some students in Beijing had called for quiet protest 
walks in the square on this day of the Qingming Festival. Traditionally, 
Chinese sweep the graves of deceased relatives. The idea of the walks was to 
avoid slogans, banners and organized groups that would lead to certain arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities responded by issuing private warnings against visiting the square, 
and with a show of force Thursday that included small bands of helmeted police 
armed with rifles who cruised the perimeter of the square and other parts of 
the city on three-wheel motorcycles. Red fire trucks fitted with water cannon 
were positioned near the square. 
</P>
<P>
Some leaflets had been circulated on Beijing campuses calling for people to 
wear traditional mourning symbols, white flowers or black armbands. The 
authorities had made it clear that anyone doing so was likely to be arrested, 
and such displays were not in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
But at one point Thursday afternoon, on a sidewalk outside police lines at the 
edge of Tian An Men Square, several dozen round pieces of white paper with 
diamond-shaped holes in the middle fluttered in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"White flowers," a student standing nearby said in English, addressing no one 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Crowded on the sidewalk were travelers from other parts of China, some Beijing 
residents, uniformed police, plainclothes police who made no attempt to hide 
their identity and a scattering of young people who looked as if they might be 
engaged in quiet protest walks. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently none of the police saw who it was that released the paper flowers, 
and no immediate arrests were made. But earlier in the day, a young man 
approached a foreigner at the edge of the square and asked, "Are you a 
journalist?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the foreigner replied. "Are you a student?" 
</P>
<P>
The young man said he was. At that point a policeman ordered the foreigner to 
move along and demanded the student's identity papers. The policeman then 
marched the student into the nearby Revolutionary History Museum, where 
security forces have been stationed since last June's crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, another student greeted several foreigners in English. At 
the time, an organized group of Young Pioneers, the Chinese version of Boy 
Scouts and Girl Scouts, were taking part in an officially sanctioned ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"They are Young Pioneers; only they can go into the square," the student said, 
his eyes saying more than his words. 
</P>
<P>
When the foreigner identified himself as a journalist, the student said, "Oh, 
it is very dangerous," and went on his way. 
</P>
<P>
The people brave enough to go to the square with the intent of showing even a 
hint of protest were few. 
</P>
<P>
A young teacher explained why he believes it was not possible to put on a large 
protest at the square this spring, even a quiet one without slogans or banners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because we've seen blood," he said. "We've seen that there's no limit to 
what this government will do to stop us."

Photo, Silent Remembrance: On the traditional Chinese day for mourning the 
dead, heavy security deterred protests. Police sealed off the main part of 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square as bands of helmeted police cruised the perimeter 
on three-wheel motorcycles, right, in a show of force. But some people managed 
to quietly honor those killed in last June's crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrations. On one sidewalk, round pieces of white paper with 
diamond-shaped holes fluttered in the wind. Said a student quietly, referring 
to a traditional symbol of mourning, "White flowers." Agence France-Presse

King Birendra dismissed Nepal's government today and announced broad democratic 
reforms, authorizing the new government to meet with the opposition and naming 
a panel to rewrite the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Birendra also said he will order a "fact-finding mission" to investigate the 
"loss of life" of at least 23 demonstrators who died during a six-week 
pro-democracy uprising. 
</P>
<P>
He called for a special session of the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept democracy," the 44-year-old king, one of the last absolute monarchs 
in the world, told this landlocked Himalayan kingdom shortly after dawn in a 
four-minute nationwide radio broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Birendra then dismissed the government of Prime Minister Marich Man Singh 
Shrestra, saying it had failed to maintain law and order. He named Lokendra 
Bahadur Chand to replace Shrestra. 
</P>
<P>
The king authorized Chand's new Cabinet to open talks with Nepal's growing 
opposition, which has demanded that the kingdom abandon its partyless 
panchayat, or assembly, system of government in favor of true political 
pluralism. He also vowed to begin a process of constitutional reform. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping announcements followed a day of mounting tension as democracy 
advocates in the capital, Katmandu, stepped up pressure on the government. 
</P>
<P>
Panicked depositors started a run on banks Thursday as thousands of civil 
servants went on strike against government ministries and 14 state 
corporations.

IRAQ, 4 ALLIES URGE MIDEAST NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL ARMS BAN; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: THEY CALL ON WESTERN GOVERNMENTS TO PRESSURE ISRAEL TO COMPLY.

<P>
Iraq and four other Arab nations called Thursday for a ban on nuclear and 
chemical weapons in the volatile Middle East, urging Western pressure on Israel 
to comply. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, coming three days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat 
to retaliate with nerve gas against any Israeli attack, appeared designed to 
paint Israel into a diplomatic corner. It was made by the foreign ministers of 
Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, meeting in Amman, Jordan. It was seconded by the 
Syrian foreign minister in an Israeli newspaper interview. 
</P>
<P>
In public, Israel officials were skeptical of the proposal, but regional arms 
reduction has become a topic of serious discussion in the Foreign and Defense 
ministries, government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq and its three allies in the Arab Cooperation Council, concluding a two-day 
meeting in the Jordanian capital, declared that any Mideast disarmament "should 
be balanced." 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of destructive weapons, including nuclear, chemical and biological, 
should be prohibited in order to guarantee regional and international 
security," the foreign ministers said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is the only Middle Eastern nation reputed to have nuclear arms, a 
strategic trump card in any regional conflict. Although the government refuses 
to confirm its nuclear capability, Israeli leaders responded ominously to 
Hussein's threat. Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel could 
respond "many times over" to an Iraqi chemical assault. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Thursday's Arab proposal, Yosef Olmert, a government spokesman, 
remarked, "Let those who have used chemical weapons ban them first," referring 
to Iraq's wartime attacks on Iranian troops and indigenous Kurdish rebels. In 
general, Western governments accept nuclear deterrence as legitimate, but not 
chemical-warfare forces. 
</P>
<P>
In wording similar to the Arab communique, Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh of 
Syria, a stubborn foe of both Iraq and Israel, told a reporter for the Israeli 
daily Hadashot based in Paris: "If there was a sincere desire for peace and 
security, then Israel should agree to declare the Middle East an area clear of 
all destructive weaponry." 
</P>
<P>
If that phrase means elimination of strategic forces, including nuclear 
weapons, Israel would remain heavily outmanned by Arab forces, despite its 1979 
peace treaty with Egypt. And despite the vaunted Israeli edge in battlefield 
technology, discipline and training, the Arab countries continue to build up 
their conventional forces. Iraq's army, in particular, is battle-tested and 
equipped with first-class imported and adapted weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, independent Israeli analysts view the Arab offer on arms reduction 
as something new. Previously, Arab states had basically lobbied to get Israel 
to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now, they have linked 
nuclear arms control with the proven Arab capacity to deliver chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the conventional-forces advantage enjoyed by the Arabs, Israel might 
find a way to respond to arms control offers, defense analyst Gerald Steinberg 
said. "Israel could link nuclear arms control with reductions in conventional 
forces," said Steinberg, a researcher at Bar Ilan University. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed 
to this formula in talks about arms reduction in Europe. "Israel bases its 
nuclear program on the presence of large Arab armies. To give it up, Israel 
would have to be assured that it is not falling into a conventional arms trap," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Israel has declined to link chemical and nuclear arms in a single 
package. It also would prefer a regional pact on nuclear arms that would permit 
each country to inspect each other's atomic facilities. "Just having inspectors 
from hostile countries in each other's back yard would greatly reduce 
tensions," said analyst Dore Gold from the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies 
in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's tough speech Monday in Baghdad was condemned by the United 
States and other Western powers -- State Department spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler branded it "inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous" -- but it has 
rallied Arab opinion. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Arab League, meeting in Tunis, Tunisia, issued a statement 
warning Israel that any attack on Iraq would be considered an attack on all 22 
league members, Reuters news service reported. Iraq had requested the meeting 
to rally support in its disputes with Britain, Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president's words have filled the Arab world with "will, power and 
vigor," declared the Jordanian newspaper Al Rai. Jordan's King Hussein, quoted 
by the national Petra news agency, said Hussein "did not threaten anybody but 
affirmed Iraq's ability to face any planned aggression and its legitimate right 
to defend itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Cairo reporter for the London-based Mideast Mirror wrote: "Saddam's tough 
remarks created a feeling of excitement, even exhilaration, among the public, 
monopolizing conversations in sidewalk cafes." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was stung by Western criticism of his government's execution last month 
of a British-based reporter on spying charges and by the arrest in London last 
week of Iraqi citizens in an alleged plot to smuggle U.S.-made nuclear-weapons 
devices to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In response, he suggested that Israel and its Western allies were creating an 
atmosphere that invited Israeli attack on Iraqi military facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Let them drop such attempts to give Israel a pretext to strike. . . ," he 
warned. "I swear to God we will let our fire eat half of Israel if it tries 
anything against Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's threats and complaints struck a sensitive chord among the Arabs, 
whose pride has been hurt time and again by Israel's ability to strike targets 
far from its borders without fear of vengeance by strategic weapons. By 
brandishing chemical weapons, Hussein has attempted to introduce a balance of 
fear in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Military analysts are doubtful that the threat is fully substantive, noting 
that Iraq would need an arsenal of accurate missiles to carry out the boasts. 
But Iraq's mid-range missile development has jumped alarmingly since 
cross-border missiles were first introduced to the Middle East during the 
1980-88 Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Arab Cooperation Council, ostensibly an economic 
alliance, decided the time was right to once again try to tie Israel's nuclear 
hands.

PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Thursday he has asked Arab deputies in the 
Israeli Parliament to back Labor Party leader Shimon Peres in his battle to 
form a government. 
</P>
<P>
Italian officials said the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, visiting 
Italy, told Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti: "I have asked Arab deputies 
present in the Knesset (Parliament) to vote for Peres." 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Andreotti urged Arafat to help Peres form a Cabinet for the 
sake of peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Peres has said he is ready to form a government to replace the national unity 
Cabinet, led by the Likud Party, which fell last month in a dispute over a U.S. 
plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks. Peres backs the plan, while Likud leader 
Yitzhak Shamir opposes it. Parliament is expected to vote on the new government 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat is basking in a red-carpet welcome from Italy's top leaders that has 
provoked angry protests from Israel and Jewish groups. On Wednesday, those 
groups also protested his meeting in Paris with former President Jimmy Carter.

A major earthquake rocked the Northern Mariana Islands this morning, and 
seismologists pinpointed its epicenter off Anatahan Island, about 230 miles 
north of Guam. The island was evacuated two days earlier amid mounting fears 
that its volcano was erupting. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hattori of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Guam said the temblor had 
a magnitude of 7.4 and placed its epicenter in the Marianas Trench, one of the 
world's deepest ocean chasms, in the Western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Larry Guerrero of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands issued 
a tidal wave warning for Saipan and Tinian islands, part of the island cluster 
that comprise the U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
The 7:14 a.m. jolt startled residents from their sleep on Guam and several 
other islands in the Mariana chain, but there were no immediate reports of 
damage or injuries.

KAIFU ISSUES APPEAL FOR UNDERSTANDING ON REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: THE PRIME MINISTER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT 'SOME PAINS' WILL HAVE TO BE BORNE 
TO MAKE THE ACCORD WORK.

With a major U.S.-Japanese trade agreement in hand, Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu appealed to the Japanese people today for "understanding and cooperation" 
in carrying out sweeping changes in Japanese business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said at a nationally televised news conference that Japan has agreed to 
U.S. demands for a series of reforms in order to raise Japanese living 
standards and "maintain friendly relations" with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced simultaneously in Tokyo and Washington, averted a 
crisis in relations between the two countries and enabled Kaifu to survive a 
challenge second only to what he overcame in last February's election. 
</P>
<P>
Responding favorably to the announcement, both the yen and prices on the 
beleaguered Tokyo Stock Market spurted upward in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said the reforms must be carried out if Japan is to survive "as a member 
of international society." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he intends to win enactment of reform legislation in the upper house 
of Parliament, in which his party lost its majority last July, Kaifu responded: 
</P>
<P>
"You and I, all of us, are consumers. To think of consumers is to think of the 
people, the starting point of democracy. (These reforms) are not a matter of 
conflict of interest groups." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu acknowledged, however, that "some pains" will have to be borne. 
</P>
<P>
"But (these reforms) are needed to preserve our national interests and to carry 
out our duty to international society," he said. Japan, he added, must bring 
itself into harmony with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"As an international nation dependent upon trade and coexistence with other 
countries, Japan cannot survive in isolation," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual appeal underscored Kaifu's own awareness of the problems that lie 
ahead. Referring to one of them, he promised that his government will carefully 
consider measures to aid small shopkeepers as a result of concessions to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Cabinet approved the agreement at an early morning session, 
Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
condemned a decision to lift restrictions on the establishment of new 
supermarkets and department stores in large cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1,620,000 small retailers in Japan . . . have built up traditional 
community societies throughout the country," he said. "If large stores are 
established in a concentrated and disorderly fashion, tiny shopkeepers will be 
plunged into despair and confusion. Bankruptcies and abandonment of operations 
may occur." 
</P>
<P>
Ishikawa called revision of the Large Retail Store Law to remove "specific 
areas" -- phrasing that was understood to mean mainly Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya 
-- from its application is a "problem." He also condemned Kaifu's promise to 
"review" the law in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Katsuichi Yamamoto, head of a nationwide organization of neighborhood 
shopkeepers, Thursday reversed his organization's earlier opposition to 
revision of the Retail Store Law and said it would not fight an exemption for 
supermarkets and department stores in the centers of Japan's major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Kabun Muto, minister of international trade and industry, and Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, minister of finance, told Parliament on Thursday that special 
measures will be proposed to aid small shopkeepers after the law is revised. 
</P>
<P>
Naohiro Amaya, head of the Dentsu Research Institute and a former international 
trade and industry official, said he felt that the United States is placing 
excessive expectations on reform of the Large Retail Store Law. Japanese 
imports, he predicted, will not increase substantially as a result.

ABORTION STUDY CITES LITTLE MENTAL STRESS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: EXPERTS FIND NO PSYCHOLOGICAL HAZARD FOR MOST WOMEN DURING THE TWO 
YEARS FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE. LONG-TERM EFFECTS ARE UNCLEAR.

Most women who undergo legal, voluntary abortions early in their pregnancy do 
not suffer significant psychological distress during the first two years after 
the procedure, according to a study commissioned by the American Psychological 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although some women may feel regret, sadness or guilt, "the weight of the 
evidence from scientific studies indicates that legal abortion of an unwanted 
pregnancy in the first trimester does not pose a psychological hazard for most 
women," said the study, to be published today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The psychological association is on record favoring abortion rights. A panel 
selected by the association reviewed 19 studies on U.S. women's response to 
abortion that it deemed "methodologically sound." 
</P>
<P>
However, the longest follow-up of any of the studies reviewed was two years 
after abortion. "Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be drawn about 
longer-term effects," said the panel, adding that research is needed to look at 
how abortion affects a woman's mental outlook in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Gans, director of American Victims of Abortion, called the study "a 
manipulation" of data from earlier studies. 
</P>
<P>
Gans, who is a member of the National Right to Life Committee, underwent an 
abortion in 1981. "The reality of psychological trauma is there," she said. "As 
women who have been there, we can point to abortion as the source of emotional 
debris we have dealt with in our own lives. . . . For many, the problems don't 
surface until 10 years after the fact," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Louise Tryrer of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said the new 
report supports her group's belief that abortions generally do not lead to 
serious mental or emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if a significant number of women were suffering severe psychological 
problems from abortion, you would see the mental institutions overflowing -- 
and that is just not the case," Tryrer said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which conducted its review in early 1989, had previously presented 
some of its findings to then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and members of 
Congress. In January, 1989, Koop told President Reagan that he would not issue 
a long-awaited report on the after-effects of abortion because "scientific 
studies do not provide conclusive data on the health effects of abortion on 
women." 
</P>
<P>
The Science report said case studies have shown that some women do experience 
"severe distress . . . after abortion and require sympathetic care." 
</P>
<P>
But for the vast majority of women who have voluntary abortions, "severe 
negative reactions are infrequent in the immediate and short-term aftermath," 
the study said.

Cyrus R. Smith, an aviation pioneer who helped build American Airlines into one 
of the world's largest air carriers and served as secretary of commerce in the 
Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, died Wednesday after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 90, lived in Washington for many years before moving to Annapolis in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Except for military service during World War II, Smith, known to many as C. R., 
was chief executive of the commercial airline from 1934 until President Johnson 
appointed him secretary of commerce in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. C. R. was a giant in an era of aviation pioneers," American Chairman and 
President Robert L. Crandall said in a statement released at the airline's 
headquarters in Ft. Worth, Tex. "The nation has lost a great businessman, the 
industry has lost a great pioneer and we at American have lost a part of our 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Smith entered the aviation business in the days of open-cockpit biplanes. 
</P>
<P>
He learned to fly just to prove that he could, and then let his license lapse 
"because to fly good, you've got to fly a lot," he said. "I haven't the time." 
</P>
<P>
During World War II he was selected by Gen. H. H. Arnold, commander of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, to help organize the Air Transport Command, the military airline 
active in all theaters. Smith served as a major general and deputy commander of 
the transport command, which grew into one of the nation's largest military 
commands by war's end. 
</P>
<P>
He startled executives at American after his return from military service with 
his habit of typing his own speeches and most of his letters. He also wrote his 
own advertising copy and stockholder reports. 
</P>
<P>
A 1959 edition of the International Celebrity Register described Smith as a 
"feet-on-the-desk boss" who was "known to mechanic and vice president alike" as 
C. R. Dedicated to corporate democracy, Smith once said, "The minute a boy 
thinks he's an executive, we fire him." 
</P>
<P>
The book notes that Smith switched American to jet aircraft while other 
airlines were waiting to see if the public would accept planes without 
propellers. Customers did, filling American's jets to near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
American was the first airline to use sleepers, at a time when most people 
still considered flight a perilous undertaking. Smith countered that fear with 
a blunt ad campaign that asked, "Afraid to fly?" 
</P>
<P>
Born in the central Texas town of Minerva on Sept. 9, 1899, Smith grew up in a 
family of seven children which his father deserted when Smith was 9, the 
Register said. 
</P>
<P>
He quit school early to work, but returned and earned a degree in business 
administration at the University of Texas, which later honored him as a 
distinguished alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
He worked as a bank teller, bookkeeper at a cotton mill, public accountant and 
junior officer at a public utility company before joining Texas Air Transport, 
an air mail carrier, as treasurer in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
He became vice president of that company, which was merged into American 
Airways, the precursor of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed as commerce secretary in 1968, he left government to become a partner 
in the international banking firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was an authority on the history and culture of the West, and he built an 
extensive collection of paintings by celebrated artists, including Frederick 
Remington and Charles Russell. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to American in an interim capacity as chairman of the board of 
directors and chief executive officer in September, 1973, serving until 
February, 1974.

HENRY L. GOGERTY; ARCHITECT WHO DESIGNED GLIDING CLASSROOM WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry L. Gogerty, a nationally recognized architect who designed more than 350 
schools and scores of industrial projects in Southern California, has died. He 
was 96. 
</P>
<P>
Gogerty, who died Sunday in Los Angeles, designed and developed gliding 
acoustical walls to provide for flexible classroom construction. The design 
helped him win a national achievement award in the science of construction from 
the American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
He also designed major industrial projects, including the massive cargo plane 
assembly buildings for Hughes Aircraft where Howard Hughes' famous "Spruce 
Goose" was constructed. The 274,000-square-foot structure was considered a 
singular engineering achievement in wood framing. 
</P>
<P>
His business from 1923 to 1968, under H. L. Gogerty Associates, included 
shopping centers, office buildings, jails and structures for Hughes Aircraft, 
Bendix Aviation and Union Pacific Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Gogerty also designed and operated the Desert Air Hotel and Palm Desert Airpark 
in Rancho Mirage until 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 30, 1894, in Zearing, Iowa, Gogerty earned his bachelor's degree in 
architecture and engineering from the University of Illinois and a special 
certificate of architecture from USC. 
</P>
<P>
He served in the Army field artillery in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Gogerty was a trustee of St. Anne's Foundation and received its Angel Award in 
1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Carlson, the former head of United Airlines and Westin Hotels who 
conceived the idea for Seattle's landmark Space Needle, has died. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson died of cancer Tuesday night in a Seattle hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He had suggested building the Space Needle with its revolving restaurant as the 
theme building of the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. The idea was prompted by a 
revolving hotel he had seen in Stuttgart, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Tacoma, Wash., June 4, 1911, Carlson moved to Seattle as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
He began his meteoric rise in business at the bottom -- working as a bellboy at 
Seattle's Benjamin Franklin Hotel while he attended classes at the University 
of Washington. When a chance for a position as hotel pageboy fell through, he 
despaired about what he would do with his life. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlson persevered and by 1946 was assistant to the president of Western 
Hotels, a small Seattle-based hotel chain. By 1960, he was head of the greatly 
enlarged Western International Hotels chain that controlled 100 hotels. 
</P>
<P>
When the chain was merged with United Airlines in 1970, shortening its name to 
Westin, Carlson went on to become president, chairman and chief executive 
officer of UAL Inc., the umbrella holding company for the airline and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Although he retired from all company positions in 1983, Carlson was invited in 
1987 to rejoin the board of Allegis, the successor to UAL. 
</P>
<P>
He was a regent of the University of Washington, and in 1987 was named to the 
Puget Sound Business Hall of Fame.

CLAIR HUFFAKER; WROTE WESTERN BOOKS, SCRIPTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clair Huffaker, a Western novelist and screenwriter who scripted such classics 
as "The War Wagon" and "The Comancheros," has died. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Huffaker died Tuesday of an aneurysm in Norris Hospital at County-USC Medical 
Center, where he had been since March 30 for a series of tests, his wife, 
Norma, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Born Sept. 24, 1926, in Magna, Utah, Huffaker attended Princeton and Columbia 
universities and the Sorbonne in Paris. He worked in Chicago as an assistant 
editor for Time magazine before turning to fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Huffaker's stream of novels, many reprinted a decade ago, began in 1957 with 
"Rider From Thunder Mountain" and "Badge for a Gunfighter." 
</P>
<P>
He converted his 1958 novel "Badman" into a screenplay for the 1967 film "The 
War Wagon," starring John Wayne. The novel was later reprinted under the film's 
title. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Huffaker co-authored the screenplay for "The Comancheros" with James 
Edward Grant, adapting the story from a novel by Paul I. Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
Other movies for which Huffaker wrote screenplays based on his own novels 
included "Seven Ways From Sundown," "Posse From Hell," "Rio Conchos" and 
"Flap," which in book form was titled "Nobody Loves a Drunken Indian." 
</P>
<P>
Huffaker often adapted his Western themes and positive values to contemporary 
topics, including the 1970s detente between the United States and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
His novel "The Cowboy and the Cossack" in 1973 was set in 1880 czarist Siberia 
but contained clear political allegories with the communists' dependence on 
U.S. wheat and fear of Chinese aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"Beneath the flabby sentiment is a sinewy story that should appeal to the 
armchair political analyst as well as the casual cowboy," wrote Ben Reuven in a 
Los Angeles Times review of the book. 
</P>
<P>
A prolific writer, Huffaker also regularly contributed articles and short 
stories to several magazines. 
</P>
<P>
He started his own film production company in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors in addition to his wife are a daughter from a previous marriage, 
Samantha Clair Kirkeby, and a sister, Nancy Fletcher of Salt Lake City.

Prosecutors have offered a plea bargain to a former state Senate aide indicted 
in the FBI's probe of state Capitol corruption, according to a defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Chris Wing, said his client, Amiel Jaramillo, has been given a 
chance to plead guilty to a lesser charge. Jaramillo, once the top aide to 
ex-state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), was accused by federal grand 
jurors of shaking down special interests for campaign and speech money for his 
boss. Montoya was convicted in February on seven counts of corruption.

A bomb on a bus killed at least 14 people Thursday and injured 22 in the north 
Indian state of Haryana, heightening tension between Hindus and Sikhs. Police 
said the bomb exploded as the vehicle, carrying mostly Hindu office workers, 
stopped at a bus stop in the industrial town of Panipat, 110 miles from 
Chandigarh, the capital Haryana shares with neighboring Punjab, where Sikhs 
want an independent state.

GUIDELINES AWAITED ON INSURANCE PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103: FOUR MONTHS OF HEARINGS ARE DRAWING TO AN END. UNCERTAINTY OVER 
RATES HAS LEFT CONSUMER GROUPS AND COMPANIES TRADING ACRIMONIOUS CHARGES.

<P>
More than four months of state Insurance Department hearings into what 
constitutes a "fair rate of return" for insurance companies are coming to a 
close here this week in an atmosphere of recrimination and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the hearings are expected to come, by the end of the month, a set of 
profit guidelines to be recommended by Administrative Hearing Judge William 
Fernandez to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. Once reviewed and perhaps 
changed by Gillespie, these will be issued as standards for state approval of 
future auto, homeowners and various other insurance rates in the state. 
</P>
<P>
These standards also would be used for determining what, if any, rate rollbacks 
and premium rebates Gillespie may finally order pursuant to provisions of 
Proposition 103. The rollbacks have been delayed for 17 months already while 
the standards were debated and litigated. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Gillespie and the Insurance Department staff have been suggesting 
at the hearings that a fair rate of annual return for the companies should 
range, depending on circumstances, from 11.2% to 15%. The companies, by 
contrast, have been arguing for a 16% to 21% annual rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
There are a host of subsidiary issues, such as which company expenses, like 
political contributions, might be disallowed in making the calculations, and 
whether the profits should be in each line of insurance, or averaged out among 
all lines each company sells. 
</P>
<P>
The recriminations have come mainly from representatives of consumer 
organizations who charge that the hearings have been unbalanced in favor of the 
industry. They noted that many of their requests for data on company finances 
and sales practices were rejected by the hearing judge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the uncertainty has come from insurers over what conclusions 
Gillespie may reach, and what the consequences of her decisions might be. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that if Gillespie sets profit guidelines far below what 
the companies think they should be, the companies will sue to prevent her 
standards from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the result of these hearings -- which have cost the companies, and 
indirectly their California ratepayers, millions of dollars -- may be a new 
round of the litigation that has so far stymied all efforts to implement 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
There also are questions of whether the elected insurance commissioner, who 
will take office in January, may want to set his own standards, and whether the 
work done at the hearings and the conclusions reached by Gillespie will be 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they felt the hearings will prove to have been useful, various 
parties were cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Keller, an attorney for Travelers and other companies, said, "I would hope 
we're getting near the end" in setting standards for the state's new system of 
approving rates. But on the rollbacks, he said, "individual companies that are 
ordered to refund millions of dollars probably will go to court." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Gnaizda of Public Advocates Inc., representing a coalition of minority 
and low-income groups, asserted that the hearings will prove to be a waste of 
time, unless Gillespie disregards Judge Fernandez's recommendations and strikes 
out on her own to develop a more pro-consumer tack than the hearings took. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer groups directly represented -- Latino Issues Forum, Voter Revolt 
and the Consumers Union in particular -- are in a sour mood because the 
compensation from insurers for consumer attorney expenses that they had been 
promised by Gillespie at the start of the hearings has not been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the big companies have refused to pay it, and the issue of financing a 
consumer presence at the hearing is being litigated. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, one consumer representative after another rose to support motions 
charging that Fernandez had been biased against them and the minority and 
low-income groups and asking that evidence and arguments from companies that 
had refused to compensate the consumer attorneys for their efforts be ignored 
in the conclusions that are reached. Particular anger was expressed that the 
judge had refused to admit evidence on "redlining" against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
After the consumer attorneys had spoken, and insurer attorneys had rebutted 
them, Fernandez angrily left the bench without his coat, rolled up his shirt 
sleeves and, striding to the desks occupied by the consumer representatives, 
castigated them. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he is descended from several minority groups himself, the 
judge said he could not tolerate such unfair accusations. He said he 
sympathizes with the plight of minority members who are charged a great deal 
for insurance or unable to buy it. But he said that as a judge he will follow 
the law.

Women who smoke apparently are significantly more likely to have children who 
develop asthma, researchers reported. "Children whose mothers smoke half a pack 
of cigarettes or more a day are twice as likely to have asthma and are four 
times as likely to use asthma medications as are children whose mothers do not 
smoke," researchers concluded in a study published in the journal Pediatrics. 
The researchers analyzed data on 4,331 children from birth to 5 years of age. 
Dr. Michael Weitzman, an associate professor of pediatrics and public health at 
Boston University, said the data the study was based on only indicated whether 
the women had smoked during pregnancy and not after their children were born.

ESKIMOS TO HUNT PROTECTED CARIBOU

Hungry Eskimos, armed with U.S. court-ordered permits to kill 50 caribou from a 
protected herd, prepared for an emergency hunt to get fresh meat for their 
southwestern Alaska village of Kwethluk. U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland 
ruled that Kwethluk's urgent need for meat outweighed state desires to protect 
the herd until it grows big enough to support such hunts in the future. "We're 
real happy about it," said Kwethluk Village Council Vice President Moses 
Nicolai. 
</P>
<P>
Regional game biologist Randy Kacyon said he expects the hunting permits to go 
quickly, and Nicolai said hunters would be out on snowy trails today in a hunt 
expected to last a week. Kwethluk has 454 people, nearly all Yupik Eskimos who 
hunt and fish for food.

GERBER WILL MAKE FORMULA FOR ONE BOY WHO NEEDS IT TO LIVE

A Gerber research plant is retooling to resume production for a market of one: 
a profoundly allergic 15-year-old boy who cannot live without a special baby 
formula the company stopped making five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For a few days this month, one quarter of the production space at the Gerber 
Products Co. research center in Fremont, Mich., will be devoted to making MBF, 
a formula that only Raymond Dunn Jr. needs and which Gerber is providing free. 
</P>
<P>
"People here are working on this on their own time," Gerber research director 
George Purvis said Thursday. "We all have our own jobs, and this is one we 
added on." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, who lives with his parents in the Catskills town of Yankee Lake, 
weighs 31 pounds. He was born with an abnormally small head and brain. He is 
severely physically and mentally retarded and cannot speak or see. 
</P>
<P>
And, since the age of 5, Raymond has been allergic to almost every form of 
nourishment. All that kept him alive was Gerber's MBF, an expensive, meat-based 
formula for allergic infants. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, faced with declining sales, Gerber stopped making the brown liquid 
formula. The Dunns tried dozens of alternatives, but they all made Raymond 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber agreed to reveal its formula and process for making MBF to any 
manufacturer who would supply Raymond, but none was willing or able. 
</P>
<P>
"We scrounged around for every can of the stuff that was in existence," Purvis 
said, including many whose expiration date had passed. After obtaining a Food 
and Drug Administration waiver, Gerber began delivering them to the Dunns. 
</P>
<P>
The unsold backlog prolonged Raymond's life, but did not make it easier. Asthma 
kept him inside the house almost all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed life couldn't get any more difficult until the day in July, 1988, 
when Carol Dunn, Raymond's mother, received a letter from Gerber. The firm said 
its MBF was all gone, leaving Raymond with less than a two years' supply. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dunn sought help in letters to political and business leaders, including 
President Bush, Donald Trump and the Princess of Wales. But Gerber seemed her 
only hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed they wouldn't let me down because there's human beings in that 
corporation," she said. "I felt that, somehow, that Gerber would not let 
Raymond die." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber employees who had been working with Mrs. Dunn told their bosses they 
could assemble the equipment and special ingredients (including beef hearts) to 
make a limited amount of MBF.

RECORD SIGNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was amazed that a potential riot situation prompted by a record signing 
session at the Wherehouse (Metro, March 22) did not, in fact, grow worse. 
</P>
<P>
The popular British band Depeche Mode had agreed to sign autographs for its 
fans at the Wherehouse located on La Cienga in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This record signing in itself was fine. 
</P>
<P>
What tainted the signing was the continuous instigations by deejays, Richard 
Blade, Katie Manner and "The Poor man" who work for the radio station KROQ. At 
the time of the "riot," I was listening to the live reports by Richard Blade 
(who was on the scene at the Wherehouse). Blade was doing the opposite in 
responsible reporting by continually repeating "this is a serious situation," 
or "this is a potential riot." 
</P>
<P>
These actions, in my view, could only create more havoc and inevitably behoove 
additional young people to go to the record store and possibly make the 
situations worse. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Manner and "The Poor man" did no better, in having kids yell into a 
microphone so their voices could be broadcast over the air, then continuing to 
give the address of the record store as if it were an invitation to join the 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
I'm all for on-the-scene reporting. However, on an unfortunate note, especially 
for the youngsters who listen to radio stations such as KROQ and are impressed 
with these stations, I believe the three deejays involved should realize they 
conducted themselves in a self-promoting and very unprofessional manner.

DEMOCRACY IN PAKISTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your story on new democracies (Part A, March 25), your staff writers Robin 
Wright and Jim Mann make a number of flimsy and unsubstantiated charges against 
the Pakistan government. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when discussing the perceived rise in corruption during this 
government's tenure, your writers fail to provide a shred of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has repeatedly offered to sack any member of her 
government against whom a corruption charge is proved. Trial by allegation is 
neither fair nor is it practiced in any democratic nation. 
</P>
<P>
You quote an unnamed analyst as saying that Ms. Bhutto is ". . . politicking, 
not governing. . . ." Allow me to dispel this impression by quoting from the 
Jan. 8 issue of the IMF Survey: ". . . the Pakistan Government has made a 
commendable start in tackling many of the country's financial and structural 
problems. A number of further, broad-based measures are being implemented in 
the current fiscal year and others are scheduled for 1990/91 and thereafter. 
These measures are expected to correct financial imbalances . . . while putting 
Pakistan on a more balanced and sustainable economic growth path." Not a bad 
end-of-year report on somebody your "analyst" says is "not a good manager." 
</P>
<P>
Your writers then go on to speculate at some length on the stability and 
durability of this government. The recent PPP victory in a crucial Lahore 
by-election suggests that popular support is still intact, and there is no 
reason to doubt Ms. Bhutto's ability to govern for the remainder of her term. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to assure your readers that in Pakistan democracy is alive and 
well.

JAPAN'S KAIFU BLINKS (THANKFULLY) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's to be hoped that the American public will emit a genuine sigh of relief 
over the news of the breakthrough in the stalled and tense U.S.-Japanese trade 
talks. They had threatened to place relations between the two countries on a 
perilous collision course that might even have resulted down the road in a 
frightening strategic realignment. 
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu appears to want none of that and neither does 
President Bush. Both leaders are to be commended for their investment of 
personal diplomacy that seems to have produced a very significant new trade 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
The trade and economic reforms to which the Kaifu government agreed Thursday 
are aimed at dismantling the Asian Berlin Wall that has stood in the way of a 
more normal trade partnership. This abnormality -- with its artificial barriers 
to trade -- in part has accounted for the nearly $50-billion annual trade 
deficit that worries so many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the end of the negotiation: What was agreed to was a series of 
interim measures that will be reviewed, and presumably enhanced, in July. Nor 
does it mean the end of the U.S. trade deficit: As our Japanese friends rightly 
contend, many of America's economic problems stem from economic failures here 
at home, not from evildoing by trading partners abroad. But Kaifu's wise and 
timely compromise may help shift the focus to the problems of the U.S. budget 
deficit, inadequate productivity and product quality, the deteriorating public 
education system and so on. And that shift of atten tion would be in America's 
interests as well as Japan's.

ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all the media Israel-bashing lately, it was gratifying to read Rubin's 
article presenting a more realistic view of the Middle East problems. Our 
Bush-Baker policy is so self-defeating and foolish, in addition to again 
emphasizing the double standard we seem to apply only to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S demanded that the PLO stop using terrorism before we would negotiate 
with it. Therefore, we can't recognize any of its terrorist acts, obvious as 
they are, or we'd have to abandon our peace-process policy. How self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
Israel needs little prodding to seek peace. Her yearning and need for peace is 
open and well-known, even to the extent of the fall of her government. It's the 
Arab side that refuses to be satisfied with the whole nation of Jordan as its 
Arab-Palestinian state, and continues to demand Israel-granted land west of the 
Jordan River. 
</P>
<P>
Let's encourage our Administration to be evenhanded in its Middle East peace 
policy. IRVING E. FRIEDMAN

IF THE LAND BUBBLE POPS, WILL WHOLE WORLD FEEL IT?; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: OVERVALUED REAL ESTATE HAS BECOME THE TOP DOMESTIC PROBLEM. BUT A FREEZE 
MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN FELDSTEIN and KATHLEEN FELDSTEIN, Martin Feldstein was chairman of 
the Council of Economic Advisers during the Reagan Administration. His wife, 
Kathleen Feldstein, is an economist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese stock market has fallen 25% in the first three months of this 
year. The astounding loss of nearly $1 trillion has been felt not just in Japan 
but also by investors around the world. Inevitably, financial markets 
everywhere are nervous about spillover effects on other stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
But the cause for worry doesn't stop with the stock market. Financial markets 
now fear a similar collapse in the Japanese real estate market, which could 
cause widespread damage to the entire Japanese financial system. 
</P>
<P>
Since the real estate assets of Japanese corporations help to justify high 
Japanese stock prices, a collapse of the real estate market could cause a new 
round of declines in share prices. To the extent that inflated real estate 
values serve as security for bank loans, the Japanese banking system is also 
vulnerable to a real estate collapse. 
</P>
<P>
While the overvaluation of Japanese land prices is legendary, the present 
situation has become a major political problem. The vast fortunes created by 
the surge in real estate values has disturbed the traditional income 
distribution and Japanese social values. At present levels, prices are so high 
that very few Japanese can ever expect to purchase a home. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices have risen throughout the past decade at rates that are much 
greater than the increases in the consumer price level. Just in the last year, 
the average price of residential land has jumped 17% while overall consumer 
price inflation has been only about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, concerned about the increasing discontent among 
the voters, recently declared the high price of land to be Japan's most serious 
domestic problem. He endorsed a proposal to freeze the price of land in certain 
urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
But preventing land prices from rising could actually trigger a real estate 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The key problem is that today's prices cannot be justified by current rental 
levels. A Japanese real estate owner is lucky if the rent that he receives 
equals 2% of the market price of his property. Compare that with the 7% 
interest that he could receive on perfectly safe investments in Japanese 
government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
An investment in real estate makes sense only if its value is expected to keep 
increasing by at least enough to compensate the investor for the loss of 
interest income and the greater risk of investing in property rather than 
government bonds. Just to keep pace with a 7% return on government bonds, the 
real estate investor must expect his property to appreciate by at least 5%. 
With a 2% rental return, the investor can then just match the 7% return on 
government bonds. More realistically, the investor must expect a further price 
rise to compensate for the extra risk associated with real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if the government freezes real estate prices? The entire return to 
the investor must then come from rental income. Think about a property that now 
has a value of 100 million yen and an annual rental income of 2 million yen. If 
the rental income alone must yield a return of at least 7% to compete with the 
return on government bonds, then the price must fall from 100 million yen to 
less than 30 million yen. 
</P>
<P>
In actual practice, such a drastic fall is unlikely. Investors might gamble 
that the freeze would only be temporary and that the government would step in 
to offset such a severe decline in property values. That kind of speculation 
would encourage property investors to accept a temporary lower rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
But there can be no doubt that the rapid rise of Japanese land prices in recent 
years has created a financially dangerous situation. Even without government 
intervention, real estate prices cannot continue to rise at the rates of the 
recent past. And when the price increase slows, the investor's need to maintain 
the required return on property will force a fall in land prices. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the financial shock waves from Tokyo may just be beginning.

PRESSURE WON'T BREAK THIS IMPASSE; 
</P>
<P>
CHINA: THE RELATIONSHIP MUST BE BASED ON A REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF PARALLEL 
INTERESTS, NOT OUTDATED CONCEPTS AND THE TIAN AN MEN SQUARE INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY HARDING, Harry Harding, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, 
recently returned from a conference in Beijing sponsored by the National 
Committee on U.S.-China Relations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine months after the tragedy in Tian An Men Square, U.S.-China relations 
remain at an impasse. The two sides' recent efforts to improve the relationship 
have now clearly failed, and may actually have been counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial overture to the Chinese leadership, President Bush sent two 
high-ranking emissaries to Beijing in December, and subsequently lifted some of 
the sanctions he had imposed. For its part, Beijing made some adjustments in 
foreign and domestic policy, including ending martial law, releasing some 
protesters from prison, clarifying its policy on missile sales to the Middle 
East and resuming the Fulbright program in China. 
</P>
<P>
But neither country was satisfied with this exchange of gestures. Some 
Americans have expressed disappointment that Beijing did not repudiate the Tian 
An Men massacre or relax its internal political controls, without understanding 
that Beijing's elderly leaders were never going to determine their domestic 
policies on the basis of pressure from the United States. Equally 
unrealistically, the Chinese have complained about recent congressional 
sanctions and the State Department's annual human-rights report, as if either 
action could have been forestalled by the limited concessions Beijing was 
prepared to make. Each government now insists that it can go no further, and 
that is up to the other country to take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways of dealing with this impasse. One is for each side to 
increase the pressure, threatening retaliation unless it gains further 
concessions. The Bush Administration, for example, is hinting that it may not 
recommend extension of China's most-favored-nation status when it expires in 
mid-year. But the Chinese insist that they will never yield to further American 
pressure. And, even if they wished to be more accommodating, it is difficult to 
see what they could plausibly do that would immediately satisfy American 
concerns about the economic and political situation in China. Further 
confrontation, therefore, is more likely to exacerbate the impasse than to 
break it. 
</P>
<P>
Such a development would not be in America's interest. Although it is unlikely 
that China would again become a security threat to the United States, we would 
pay a substantial price for a further deterioration in ties. We need a normal 
working relationship with China, based not on outdated concepts or exaggerated 
rhetoric but on a hard-headed assessment of parallel interests. Such a 
relationship is necessary in order to address international issues like 
Cambodia and the environment, and to ensure that American firms maintain a 
competitive position in the China market. Equally important, those in China who 
still support economic and political change are virtually unanimous in warning 
that a further crisis in Sino-American relations would imperil their own 
careers and the prospects for renewed reform. 
</P>
<P>
Since further confrontation is undesirable, and more concessions from either 
side are unlikely, the alternative is to seek a breathing space. During this 
period the two governments would tacitly agree that there can be little 
possibility of a rapid improvement in their relationship, but would try to lay 
the groundwork for restoring ties. We would need to take the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration must reconstruct a domestic consensus on our China 
policy. This will require a comprehensive and persuasive statement by the 
President, outlining his vision of what kind of relationship he seeks and how 
he plans to attain it. Rebuilding the President's political base also 
necessitates a more conciliatory approach toward Congress, acknowledging that 
the White House has no monopoly of wisdom on dealing with China. 
</P>
<P>
We need to move beyond the Tian An Men incident in defining our China policy. 
We should neither forget nor forgive what happened in Beijing. Indeed, we can 
be confident that future generations of Chinese leaders will evaluate the 
demonstrations and their suppression very differently from those in power now. 
But it is futile to expect that the current leadership will express any regret 
or apology. Instead of dwelling on the past, we should look to the future, 
insisting on evidence that China is again moving, as Chinese leaders claim, in 
the direction of economic and political reform. 
</P>
<P>
We then need to examine that evidence with a clear eye and an open mind. The 
situation in China today is extremely complex. Although the party is indeed 
attempting to reassert its control over society, many localities and 
institutions are evading its reach. Although some leaders are articulating a 
much more limited vision of political and economic change than was the case a 
few years ago, there is enormous pressure from below for further reform. Our 
understandable sensitivity to the negative trends should not blind us to more 
positive developments when they occur. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we need to keep the door to China open, not only to gain a balanced 
assessment of a complicated and fluid situation but also to maintain contact 
with those in China who wish to promote change. This implies that, unless the 
domestic situation in China further deteriorates, or unless Beijing adopts a 
more hostile policy toward the United States, it would be unwise to enact 
further sanctions. We should also preserve the institutional infrastructure for 
dialogue with China, particularly in the academic, commercial and policy 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
One of the many tragedies of the last nine months has been that the Bush 
Administration has pursued a sound policy -- expressing outrage at the Tian An 
Men incident while attempting to maintain contact with China -- in an inept and 
counterproductive way. By sending Brent Scowcroft to Beijing to raise effusive 
toasts to Chinese leaders, the White House generated unrealistic expectations 
in the United States about reciprocal concessions. In so doing, it lost 
domestic support for its China policy without improving our relationship with 
Beijing. It would only compound the tragedy if, frustrated at its own 
miscalculations, the Administration were now to threaten further sanctions. 
Instead, it is wiser to step back from the impasse and wait and see whether 
there are signs of renewed progress toward economic and political reform in 
China. If so, that will be the true basis for a recovery of U.S.-China 
relations.

ANTE UP IF YOU'RE CABLED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KINSLEY, Michael Kinsley writes the TRB column for The New Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's happened to your Cable TV bill recently? Mine's risen by almost half in 
the past couple years -- from $15 to $22 a month for basic, no-frills service. 
A year of cable now costs more than a nice color television. 
</P>
<P>
As of December, 1986, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission 
"deregulated" the cable industry. That is, they forbade local governments from 
restricting cable rates and made it virtually impossible to take away a cable 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation in general -- of airlines, for example -- has been a great success 
of free-market economics. But cable deregulation suffers from a laughable flaw: 
Cable systems aren't a free market. They're a government-granted monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the FCC are now reconsidering their folly. Unfortunately, cable 
operators have become a new wing of the business Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
A government study last summer determined that in less than two years after 
deregulation, basic cable rates increased 26%-29% -- four times the rate of 
inflation. The cable companies note in response that if you include premium 
services like HBO, the increase was only 14%. And if you figure it per-channel, 
there was no increase at all, thanks to added channels. 
</P>
<P>
The price of premium services went down precisely because they're in 
competition with one another -- HBO versus Showtime, etc. It's the basic 
service that's the monopoly. As for those extra channels, you can only watch 
one at a time. Most customers might not feel that the Shoelace Channel, the 
Herbal Tea Channel and so on are worth exactly as much as NBC or CNN. In any 
event, the price of cable ought to be going down, not up, as the fixed costs 
can be spread over more and more subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The cable companies offer fancy studies by rent-an-experts to "prove" that they 
actually have no monopoly power; that deregulation has had no effect on the 
market value of cable franchises; that this market value doesn't reflect 
monopoly profits. These arguments bring to mind Groucho's famous line, "Who are 
you going to believe: me or your own two eyes?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the year before the deregulation law was enacted, buyers were paying 
less than $1,000 per subscriber for cable systems. By last year, prices were up 
to around $2,600 per subscriber. ($2,600 is three or four times what it would 
cost to build a cable system from scratch.) Now system sales have ground to a 
halt, and the stock price of publicly traded cable companies is down because of 
the reregulation debate. That also shows that regulation affects a company's 
value. How could it not? 
</P>
<P>
The draft bill now in front of the Senate communications subcommittee would 
permit cities once again to set rates for their cable franchises if there is no 
competition and would take steps to promote genuine competition. Cable 
reregulation will be debated in Congress over the next few months. You can 
watch the show on C-SPAN -- if you can still afford it.

Cal Poly Pomona, 4-3, in a 10-inning California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game 
at Matador Field on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of errors by Richardson had helped Pomona tie the score, 3-3, in the 
eighth inning, and Lopez had thrown 146 pitches in the first 10 innings and was 
ready to raise that total in the 11th if needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to go back out there," Lopez said after improving his record to 
6-4 and throwing his fifth complete game. "I didn't feel like I had lost much 
from the early innings." 
</P>
<P>
Because of a throwing error by Bronco relief pitcher Kevin Chavez, Lopez didn't 
have to test his right arm further. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who replaced starter Erick Gomez with runners at first and second and 
no one out in the 10th, fielded Kyle Washington's sacrifice bunt, but his throw 
to third base got past a lunging Grant Stephens, allowing Andy Hodgins to score 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the ninth in the past 10 games for Northridge (21-13, 8-5 in 
conference play) and kept the Matadors two games behind first-place UC 
Riverside (25-9, 9-2), which beat Cal State Dominguez Hills, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Johnson (two for four) walked on a full count to start the winning rally, 
and, after being replaced by pinch-runner Hodgins, Mike Solar followed with a 
single through the right side of the infield that knocked out Gomez (2-7). 
</P>
<P>
Gomez gave up nine hits and eight walks while throwing 159 pitches, most of 
which were breaking balls. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never hit him very hard," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not, but the Matadors appeared to have all the runs they needed when 
Denny Vigo (two for five) singled in Richardson to give Northridge a 3-1 lead 
in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the top of the Pomona lineup in the eighth, Lopez retired Danny Andrews 
and Ed Cartwright on called strikes but walked Scott Daniels on five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
John Helvin's single put runners at first and second, and, when Jason Kieline's 
line drive popped out of the glove of a diving Richardson, the bases were 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Designated-hitter Yanni Aghili (two for four) followed with a routine ground 
ball toward second that took a wicked hop at the edge of the infield grass and 
went under Richardson's glove to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told Scott not to worry about it," Lopez said. "I figured we'd score 
again and I really felt like they weren't going to score any more off me. . . . 
They didn't hit me hard. They were getting a bleeder here and a bleeder there." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge took a 2-0 lead in the third. Mike Sims led off with a walk and 
Craig Clayton doubled him to third. Sims scored and Clayton went to third on a 
wild pitch by Gomez. Richardson (two for four) grounded out to score Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez retired eight in a row after giving up consecutive singles with one out 
in the second, but Pomona (9-25, 3-11) used a walk and two singles to score a 
run in the fifth.

EL CAMINO REAL'S BOLDT TOUGH NUT TO CRACK, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For high drama, one would be hard-pressed to find a better package than El 
Camino Real High's 6-4 squeaker over host San Fernando in a Northwest Valley 
Conference baseball game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But for Sean Boldt and Richard Sanchez, it was just another act in a 
long-running show. Boldt, a pitcher for El Camino Real (8-0-1), The Times' 
top-ranked team in the region, and Sanchez, a senior third baseman for 
fifth-ranked San Fernando, met once again in tense competition, as they have 
been doing since their Little League days. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been going one-on-one against him since I was 10," Boldt said. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was Boldt winning the battle of one-upmanship. He retired Sanchez 
twice in the final three innings -- including the game's final out -- to seal 
his first save of the year and make a winner of starter Ryan McGuire (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
What made this latest confrontation between the longtime rivals more memorable 
were the circumstances: Two of the City Section's top teams locked in a 
give-and-take game for the second time in three days. And when McGuire, 
pitching with a slightly aggravated hamstring, tired in the fifth, Boldt got 
his first call of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt, a junior right-hander who was trying to protect a one-run lead, found 
the bases loaded, two out and Sanchez staring at him. Sanchez came to bat with 
eight hits in his last nine tries, a conference-leading 24 hits and a .543 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fully aware of that," Boldt said. "We had it on our charts." 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity, then, bred relaxation for Boldt, who coaxed Sanchez into ending 
the inning -- albeit on a stinging line drive to center fielder Jeff Marks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with Tigers at first and third in the seventh, McGuire threw his body in 
front of Sanchez's sharp, two-out grounder to first base, and, from his knees, 
fired a line drive to Boldt who beat Sanchez to the bag as the base flew into 
the air from the impact of colliding feet. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, it did not appear as if El Camino Real would need Boldt's heroics. 
With the score tied, 1-1, in the third inning, the Conquistadores touched 
Hector De La Cruz (2-2) for four runs and a 5-1 lead. Pat Treend had a 
run-scoring double, Greg Lederman hit an RBI single and Gregg Sheren ripped a 
two-run double into the gap in left-center. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (8-3-2, 5-3-1) chipped away, however, scoring once in the third on 
Adrian Diaz's double and twice in the fourth on a Carlos Rodriguez double and a 
McGuire balk with a runner on third. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real scored an unearned run in the top of the seventh to account for 
the final score.

4 SOUTH BAY GIRLS MAKE DIVISION TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four South Bay players, including two from West Torrance High School, have been 
named to the All-Southern Section Division II girls basketball team by members 
of the First Interstate Bank/Amateur Athletic Foundation board of 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance guard Rosa Olloque and North Torrance center Laura Collins were 
repeat selections on the All-Division II first team. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Lily Cabaleiro of Bishop Montgomery also made the squad. 
</P>
<P>
West guard Mary Litzenberg earned second-team honors. 
</P>
<P>
Olloque averaged 22 points a game, leading West to a second-place finish behind 
Morningside in the Ocean League and a berth in the Southern Section 4-A finals. 
The Warriors lost to La Quinta of Westminster, 72-62, in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, a 6-foot senior who signed early with UCLA, averaged 25.1 points and 
15.4 rebounds to lead North to a third-place finish in the Ocean League and a 
spot in the 4-A quarterfinals. She was the Most Outstanding Player in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Cabaleiro was the floor leader for surprising Bishop Montgomery, which reached 
the 4-A semifinals after finishing second in the Angelus League. The 5-6 point 
guard averaged 16.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
Litzenberg, Olloque's back-court mate at West, averaged 16 points a game and 
was the Warriors' leading rebounder and three-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia, a 6-1 center for 4-A champion La Quinta, was named Division II 
Player of the Year. Like Collins, she signed early with UCLA.

CAREER IS A CHANGE-UP FOR LONG BEACH PITCHER; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: DWAYNE FOWLER LEFT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS BECAUSE HE 
WANTED TO BE A CATCHER. BUT THE 49ERS, TOO, PUT HIM ON THE MOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Change has been a way of life for Dwayne Fowler in high school and in college 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Long Beach but played baseball at a private high school in 
Norwalk. He started as a catcher and was switched to pitcher. Most recently, he 
went from Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills to Division I Cal State Long 
Beach, from a small, rebuilding program to one of the nation's top 10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of last season, Fowler decided that he didn't want to continue at 
Dominguez Hills and requested a release to play at another college. The Toros' 
second-year coach, George Wing, granted it, allowing Fowler to change schools 
without losing eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several reasons why I wanted to leave," Fowler said. "The main one 
was that I wanted an opportunity to play more." 
</P>
<P>
At Dominguez Hills, Fowler found himself without a starting position and felt 
left out of the new coach's plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had no need for him to play catcher," Wing said. "We told him that we 
wanted to make him a pitcher, and that's what we worked on with him. I think 
it's kind of ironic that he left (Dominguez Hills) still wanting to be a 
catcher, and he ended pitching on another team." 
</P>
<P>
In his first year at Dominguez Hills, Fowler played in 30 games and seemed to 
be the leading candidate for the starting catcher's job as a sophomore. 
However, his offensive statistics weren't very impressive. He batted only .188 
with two doubles and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason he was not used as a pitcher in his first year was that there 
were injury problems, and the team needed a catcher," Wing said. "(Former 
Coach) Andy Lopez had wanted to use him for a pitcher from the very start." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler's sophomore year was a disappointment, and his playing time was reduced. 
He had only six at-bats and one hit. But he did show some promise as a pitcher, 
posting a 1-1 record in five appearances with a 5.74 earned-run average on a 
team that finished 16-29-1. 
</P>
<P>
At Leffingwell Christian High School in Norwalk, Fowler had a different 
baseball coach in each of his four years. As a freshman at Dominguez Hills, he 
played for Lopez, who left to take the head job at Pepperdine. Enter Wing, his 
sixth coach in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
After last season, Fowler decided that it was time to pick his own coach: Cal 
State Long Beach's Dave Snow. He added that he wanted to play closer to home 
and that educational considerations were also involved in his decision to 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he called Snow over the summer and asked if he was looking for an 
extra player. When Snow said he would take a look at him, Fowler thought he 
would be a catcher again. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach coach had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he had a good arm when I let him try out," Snow said. "He has very good 
potential; it's just that he needs time to develop it." 
</P>
<P>
Snow told Fowler that he had enough catchers, that what he needed was pitching. 
Fowler agreed to make the change permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I wanted to take such a drastic step," he said, "but I did 
know that I wanted to play baseball this season. Catching was still on my mind 
when I started the season. Now I like pitching too." 
</P>
<P>
This season Fowler has been thrown into the role of middle-inning reliever. In 
23 innings of work in 15 games, he has posted an 0-1 record with 25 strikeouts 
and nine walks. 
</P>
<P>
Although this is one of the most unheralded positions on the team, Fowler is 
happy with it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Being a middle reliever) has helped me to make the change," he said. "I don't 
have the pressure of being a starter or a closer." 
</P>
<P>
When the starter is knocked out, his job is to keep the game close until the 
last couple of innings, when the stopper comes in. 
</P>
<P>
In this relatively anonymous role, Fowler said, he has had the opportunity to 
work on throwing various pitches and deciding which pitch to throw. His goal is 
to be the 49ers' short-relief man next year. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler has a biting knuckle-curve ball and a decent fastball. As long as he 
keeps the ball down, Snow said, he's a tough pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that I have to do is learn to be more relaxed when I pitch," 
Fowler said. "Sometimes I get a little too juiced up when I'm on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
When he first started pitching this season, he tried to strike out every 
batter, he said, but now he has learned to rely on the fielders behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, a junior majoring in physical education with a minor in history, has 
had to make another adjustment since moving to Division I: learning how to play 
with better athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But though baseball is a little more challenging in the Big West Conference, 
the game is still played the same, Fowler said. He is confident that with a 
little more experience, he will measure up. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be easier for guys who have played in large high schools or colleges 
before coming (to Long Beach)," he said, "(but) they don't have any more talent 
than I've got." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler has followed the route of most aspiring baseball players, starting with 
Little League. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime I can get out to the playing field, I'm out there," he said. "I just 
love getting out in the open and throwing the ball around." 
</P>
<P>
He still hopes to play in the major leagues, and Snow said several teams have 
taken a look at him this season. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, Fowler said, he will end up as high school teacher, maybe a coach.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER DODGER TRADES BAT FOR BALL IN EL CAMINO REAL BATTING PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Cey approached Mike Maio and apologized. Sorry, Cey said, but he had a 
scheduling conflict that would prevent him from attending El Camino Real High 
baseball practices for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Maio, the El Camino Real coach, shrugged, shook Cey's hand and told the former 
major league All-Star third baseman to make practice when it was convenient. 
</P>
<P>
Cey, of course, is one of Maio's assistant coaches, right? If not, he has to be 
a part-time batting instructor, doesn't he? A fielding coach? 
</P>
<P>
None of the above. Cey, on occasion, pitches batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes out when he can," Maio said. "He's been out maybe a half-dozen times 
or so." 
</P>
<P>
Can the former Dodger and Cub still bring it? 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a strike," Maio said. "And he doesn't waste any time." 
</P>
<P>
The Cey family lives in Woodland Hills and Daniel Cey is a freshman on the 
Conquistadore junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, however, is no pitcher. He is -- you guessed it -- a third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Highlander high point: Granada Hills was winless in Northwest Valley Conference 
play until Tuesday's 2-1 defeat of Canoga Park. The victory was posted by 
junior right-hander Bryan Martin, who was making his first pitching start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who is also the Highlanders' quarterback, threw a four-hitter, struck 
out six and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Nice timing: It was no coincidence that Kennedy's Garret Anderson orally 
committed to play baseball next season at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Bulldogs succeeded in signing Anderson's teammate, shortstop 
Gino Tagliaferri, to a letter of intent. Tagliaferri later was drafted and 
signed by the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that a Fresno State assistant, in town to scout Tagliaferri 
during a winter-league game last year, was impressed with what he saw from the 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he saw a four-hit game I had against Chatsworth," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Claim to fame: Jeff Bishop of Antelope Valley readily offers evidence of his 
worthiness as a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard of Roger Salkeld?" Bishop said. "I hit a triple off him." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, a pitcher who graduated from Saugus last season after a celebrated 
three-year Golden League career, was chosen third in the nation by the Seattle 
Mariners in last June's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
An apparent big-leaguer-to-be, Salkeld even appears this spring on a Topps 
baseball card -- one of which Bishop has pinned to his bedroom wall. The back 
of Salkeld's card states that the 6-foot-5 right-hander, who was 31-7 at 
Saugus, never yielded a home run or a triple in his high school career. 
</P>
<P>
Balk, says Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a freshman and he was a sophomore, and I hit our fence off him -- dead 
right-center, the 395 (-foot) sign," Bishop said. "It was the last game of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
As proof, Bishop keeps a newspaper clipping of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It says right here," Bishop said, clipping in hand, " 'Jeff Bishop tripled to 
right-center off Centurion reliever Roger Salkeld.' 
</P>
<P>
"People say he's unhittable. I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Bombs away: Taft basketball Coach Jim Woodard stood on the blacktop and watched 
his sixth-period basketball class play as though the term structured was not in 
its vocabulary. Keep in mind that most of the Taft varsity is enrolled in the 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Woodard thinks he knows why things are rather wild. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the court," he said. "It slants to one side, it's too short, the wind 
is blowing, the sun's in their eyes and the rims and backboards neutralize any 
outside shooter." 
</P>
<P>
But that may be the least of the team's worries. It seems that sea gulls also 
use the court for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent team banquet, in fact, Woodard awarded one player a gag gift in 
honor of his being bombed by a gull: a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs sent down: Ryan Briggs, the first freshman to start at Simi Valley, has 
been moved to the junior varsity after sustaining a knee injury. During Briggs' 
recovery, Tyler Nelson returned from a shoulder injury and moved to third base. 
That pushed Joe Gordon back to second, where Briggs was playing. "Ryan needs to 
play a lot right now, so we felt it was better to have him at the junior 
varsity level," Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
Family matter: Camarillo junior David Harbour, the Valley area's leading scorer 
last season at 27.7 points a game, is considering a transfer to a 
higher-profile basketball program. According to his father, John, David's 
status will be somewhat determined by his performance with a Mid Valley 
American Roundball Corp. team that is competing in Virginia this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
John Harbour, who resigned as Camarillo's coach after the past season, said 
there is a 70% chance that David would remain at Camarillo for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of it depends on how well things go out in Virginia," John Harbour 
said. "If he gets a lot of attention and it looks like he'll get a scholarship, 
then he'll stay at Camarillo. But if things don't look so good, we feel he 
needs to do something else, like play for a good team that is going to be 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
John Harbour said he might attend UC Irvine himself and allow David to play at 
Mater Dei, last year's Division I state champion. Harbour stresses that he is 
content with Camarillo's program but is looking elsewhere for financial 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a $40- to $50,000 scholarship," Harbour said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray area: Thanks in no small part to the pitching of Danny Gray, Glendale is 
back in the Pacific League hunt. A senior right-hander, Gray hurled a two-hit 
shutout against Hoover a week ago, allowing just two runners to reach second 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, Gray (3-1) limited Crescenta Valley to two hits but was 
charged with his lone loss. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been as good as any, if not the best, pitcher in the league so far," said 
Coach Chris Axelgard, whose team is 5-2-1, 2-2-1 in league play. "He's just 
starting to mature. He understands his role on the team and he's taking it very 
seriously."

OH, WHAT A FEELING -- DREAM COMES TRUE FOR LONG BEACH COACH; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: AS NEW HEAD COACH AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH, SETH GREENBERG TENDS TO 
HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS AND ONE OF HIS STRONGEST ASSETS -- RECRUITING 
PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Seth Greenberg, on his new job as men's basketball coach at Cal State Long 
Beach, looked contented behind what had been Joe Harrington's desk. 
Harrington's things were in boxes on the floor; his executive putting green 
stood ready to be packed. 
</P>
<P>
A radio, which had played country-Western music when Harrington was coach, 
emitted classic rock. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow flowers brightened the modest office. The accompanying card read, 
"Dreams do come true," and identified the senders as Greenberg's wife, Karen, 
his 2-year-old daughter, Paige, and his dog, Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, what a feeling. 
</P>
<P>
It was a feeling Greenberg first experienced 12 years ago when, on the day he 
graduated from Farleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J., he was hired as 
an assistant coach at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the same way I felt when I got this job -- a dream come true," said the 
33-year-old Greenberg, who recently was promoted from associate head coach to 
succeed Harrington, who left to become coach at the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember how little I knew about the job I was about to take on, but how 
excited I was, like a kid on his first Christmas," Greenberg said. "I had this 
little office, but I thought it was the greatest office in the world. I 
remember watching my first film as a coach and thinking that there can't be 
anything better in life." 
</P>
<P>
Although he made only $12,500 a year, he recalled receiving his first paycheck 
and saying: "They're paying me to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
Having grown up in a middle-class family on Long Island, he had still been 
close to home then, living in a small apartment at 125th Street and Riverside 
Drive in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am, 12 years later, in a place I never fathomed I'd be," he said. "I 
thought Pittsburgh was a long way from New York." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia and the University of Pittsburgh were the first stops on a journey 
whose length made Greenberg eventually wonder if he would be an assistant 
forever and whether he should get out of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
He had spent two years at Columbia, three at Pitt, one at Virginia and three at 
the University of Miami (Fla.) before coming to Long Beach three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fluorescent ceiling panels above his new desk were reflected in Greenberg's 
long expanse of shiny forehead, which still bore the kiss of an island tan 
acquired two weeks ago in Honolulu, where the 49ers lost to Hawaii in the 
National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The brow was virtually unfurrowed, despite the recruiting travails that were on 
Greenberg's mind. He worried that a top prospect might go elsewhere because, 
compared with more glamorous big-name schools, "we may not sound good to the 
guys in the parks." 
</P>
<P>
"My success or failure," Greenberg said, "is going to depend on recruiting. I 
don't care who you are. Bobby Knight's a great coach, but he has great players. 
Great players make great coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting has long been Greenberg's passion. He was involved in persuading all 
but one of the players on this season's 23-9 team to come to Long Beach. Most 
of them will be back next season, joined by several newcomers of promising 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
He turned his attention to the players as he met Monday afternoon with Matt 
Ruiz, a 49er assistant. "Make sure they are doing the right thing in the 
classroom," he told Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
Then he said: "We're going to play 11 guys. If not, we're going to have unhappy 
guys. We'll tell them to go in and play their hearts out, and that then we'll 
give them a blow (rest) and then we'll have them go in and play their hearts 
out again. 
</P>
<P>
"I want happy players. Happy players work hard at practice. Happy players go to 
class. Happy players are a positive reflection on the university because they 
end up as graduates." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, as they were under Harrington, will continue to be an up-tempo, 
pressing team. "We'll play as fast or faster," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg was not completely surprised by last week's sudden turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Joe becoming more marketable as we made our march, winning nine games in 
a row," he said. "And all the publicity about the NCAA (not inviting Long Beach 
to its tournament) brought our program and Joe major notoriety. That opened the 
doors for this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg says his efforts as Harrington's top assistant made him his ideal 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing Joe gave me was a lot of freedom," he said. "He gave me the 
opportunity to grow as coach, and he had tremendous confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, when asked about Greenberg, Harrington had said: "He'll be a very 
good head coach one day. He certainly has paid his dues." 
</P>
<P>
How will Greenberg be to play for, to work for? 
</P>
<P>
"You know I'm no day at the beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former 49er center John Hatten once said of Greenberg: "He's got an attitude 
about him -- if he's in a bad mood, look out." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg explained: "I'm very hyper and aggressive. I'm demanding and driven. 
I can be moody. Not everyone wants to be around someone like that. But I think 
I'm very fair." 
</P>
<P>
After Greenberg was named coach at a press conference March 29, forward Kevin 
Cutler said: "We just hope he doesn't get as stressed out as he did as an 
assistant, throwing his jacket." 
</P>
<P>
During practices or games, Greenberg was often even more emotional and fiery 
than Harrington. But he intends to be less hyper. 
</P>
<P>
"A team takes on the personality of the coach," he said. "If I'm worried or 
up-tight, that could be a problem with the team not playing relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
On Greenberg's first day on the job March 30, George Allen, the 49ers' football 
coach, had come in and said: "Don't try to be Joe Harrington. Be Seth 
Greenberg." 
</P>
<P>
On a board Allen had written: "TO WIN: 1. Work hard. 2. Work smart. 3. Great 
attitude. 4. Improve every day. 5. ???" And he signed it, "GA, 3-30-90," as if 
it would stay on the board forever. 
</P>
<P>
When Greenberg asked him what the fifth factor was, Allen had said: "I'll leave 
that up to you, young man." 
</P>
<P>
"Get some players," Greenberg had replied. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg has yet to sign a contract. He expects a salary similar to what 
Harrington was getting, about $70,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington signed a five-year contract at Colorado for more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned with what this is going to do for me financially (in the 
future)," insisted Greenberg, who turned down a lucrative offer three years ago 
to enter shopping center development. "If (big money) happens, so be it. I'm 
happy now. The most important thing is the opportunity. I have no fear or 
apprehension. I feel I can take some credit in the success we've had here." 
</P>
<P>
Under Harrington and Greenberg, the 49ers were 53-36, turning around a program 
that had been down for most of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
After a night in which he had trouble sleeping, Greenberg made out a list early 
the morning of March 30. 
</P>
<P>
On it, he had written: "Be patient, listen and hear, smile, relax and smell the 
roses, have time for family, treat players and coaches as individuals, 
communicate, delegate authority, have confidence in others and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the list Monday, lingered on the last item and smiled, aware of 
the reality that confronts all head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine having fun and losing," he said.

CHATSWORTH CONTINUES TURNAROUND WITH 2ND VICTORY OVER KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After failing to win in three outings and falling to 3-3-1 in the Northwest 
Valley Conference last week, Chatsworth High's baseball team seemed to be 
facing hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, however, defeated powerful Kennedy on Thursday for the second time 
in three days, posting a 4-0 conference win at Kennedy. The Chancellors beat 
Kennedy, 14-4, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth left-hander Danny Rodriguez (4-1) allowed three hits over six 
innings. Rodriguez walked two batters to open the seventh, but reliever Mitch 
Root retired the side. 
</P>
<P>
Root added two hits for Chatsworth (10-3-1, 5-3-1 in league play). Cody 
Beaumaster (4-1) allowed two earned runs in six innings for Kennedy (11-3, 
7-2). 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Birmingham 8, North Hollywood 7 -- Birmingham took advantage of 12 errors in a 
Valley Pac-8 Conference game at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Marks' three-run home run in the top of the seventh pulled North

won without benefit of a hit, two infield errors paving the way. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bookatz had two hits for Birmingham (6-5-1, 5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 14, Reseda 0 -- London Woodfin registered his second three-hit game of 
the week to lead Sylmar in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game. 
</P>

<P>
Bell-Jeff 3, Alemany 2 -- Andrea Ferchaw scored on a passed ball with one out 
in the bottom in the seventh inning for host Bell-Jeff (8-6, 2-0) in a San

NOON DOES HIS BEST ONE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brent Noon surpassed his state best shotput with a throw of 73-feet-5 3/4 in a 
dual meet with San Dieguito on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago Noon eclipsed the 70-foot mark and set the state best at 
73-3. 
</P>
<P>
Both marks are not considered records because they came in meets other than the 
State Finals. 
</P>
<P>
Noon credited improved technique for his lengthy tosses. 
</P>
<P>
"That last throw could have been the 77-footer (the National Federation High 
School record set by Michael Carter in 1979)," Noon said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't, Noon said, because he still needs a little work at the end of his 
spin. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Noon, Brent's father and coach, said Brent's technique on the final 
throw was near perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"That 73-5 3/4 could have been a new National Federation record," he said. 
"Today for first time I saw him throw it good technically and you saw what 
happened on the last throw." 
</P>
<P>
But . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Brent still hasn't really hit the ball yet," Jim Noon continued. "It's very 
difficult to get (momentum) to go linearly (from the spin). The left arm keeps 
going to the left and the ball (in the other hand) is going away from the body 
to the right. You don't have a nice linear punch. It's like getting hit with a 
side-arm slap instead of a punch and if you're on the end of the punch, you'll 
know the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noon feels he is about to pop that 77-footer. He has been edging upward 
by a couple inches each meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting consistent at this mark (between 73 and 74 feet)," he said. "And 
that's usually when you'll hit a big one. I know it's there." 
</P>
<P>
Noon next throws at the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday. JOHN GEIS

One-Year T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell at 
the latest auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury sold $9.8 billion of new bills at an average discount rate of 
7.72%, down from 7.76% at the last comparable auction on March 8. The rates 
were the lowest since Feb. 13, when the one-year bills sold for 7.42%. The new 
discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 8.32%, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,219.40.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HIGH TECH: REALITY CHECK DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High-technology stocks, the stars of the first quarter, suddenly are leading 
Wall Street's "uh-oh" list. 
</P>
<P>
That's uh-oh, as in, "Uh-oh, the company just said earnings are going down 
instead of up. There goes the stock price." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, two more tech companies that had been on a lot of brokerage "buy" 
lists announced that they will fall short of analysts' earnings expectations 
for the recent quarter: 
</P>
<P>
Tandem Computers, which makes high-performance "un-crashable" computer systems, 
said revenue in the quarter ended March 31 ran below the bullish levels it had 
expected. As a result, the company warned that quarterly earnings will be below 
the 29 cents a share earned in the Dec. 31 quarter, though still above the 17 
cents earned in the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Investors gave Tandem no quarter: The stock plunged $4.625 to $22.625, a drop 
of 17%. 
</P>
<P>
ADAC Labs, a producer of medical imaging equipment, announced that earnings for 
the last quarter will be substantially below year-earlier levels because of 
growing competition and tighter hospital budgets. The stock slumped 62.5 cents 
to $1.125, a loss of 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Businessland Inc., a computer retailing chain, said Thursday that 
its operations probably just broke even in the March 31 quarter because of 
"inventory adjustments" and lower profit margins at stores outside the United 
States. Businessland stock tumbled $1.50 to $8.875. 
</P>
<P>
The latest announcements follow a spate of disappointing sales and earnings 
projections from other tech companies, including software hotshot Oracle 
Systems and voice-mail equipment maker Digital Sound Corp. And they all raise 
one big question: Is the high-tech group overall going to make fools out of the 
investors who jumped into the first-quarter rally, believing that there was 
value in the beaten-down stocks? 
</P>
<P>
The simple answer is that the only way that can happen is if the economy was 
far weaker in the first quarter than most people now estimate. And if that was 
the case, earnings will look lousy everywhere. So a lot of people will feel 
foolish. 
</P>
<P>
The better way to digest the latest disappointments, veteran tech investors 
say, is to realize that high tech is a big universe, and at any given time some 
companies are bound to be running into trouble. Though the disappointments are 
getting the attention now, it was just three weeks ago that Apple Computer 
announced that its first quarter would be better than expected, partly because 
of stronger sales, notes analyst Bruce Lupatkin at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that's little consolation to someone who just bought Tandem at $27 a 
share. But investors buying Tandem, Apple, Oracle or any other tech stock 
should be following the cardinal rules of investing in volatile fields like 
this one. That is, you never sink a big share of your portfolio into one of 
these stocks; you diversify like crazy, and, if you've made a lot of money in a 
short period, you take some profits. 
</P>
<P>
Tech companies, for all their promise, have to be approached differently from 
many other industries, said Roger McNamee, who runs T. Rowe Price Associates' 
Science &amp; Technology stock mutual fund. "What we've seen is a reality check 
in the last 10 days," he said. And reality is that "these are very difficult 
businesses to run for quarterly earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Because tech product order cycles can be so unpredictable, most tech company 
managers know they'll fail if they try to meet quarterly profit projections, 
McNamee said. Instead, they concentrate on meeting their annual targets. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee owns Tandem stock and insists that the company has a hot line of 
computer products that solve the database and networking problems of many 
computer users. The latest quarter may not have been on target, he said, "but a 
year from now you'll look back and say, 'So what?' " 
</P>
<P>
As for the tech group in general, despite its first-quarter surge, McNamee and 
other analysts still say the stocks' price/earnings multiples are reasonable by 
historical standards. A stock that sold for 50 times annual earnings per share 
in 1983, at the peak of the last tech cycle, now may sell for 25 times 
earnings. "Valuations are anything but ridiculous," Lupatkin argues. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, if the recent tech frights make you look a little closer at your 
portfolio, good for you. Steven Gerber, analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles, removed his "buy" recommendation on ADAC Labs on March 
26 -- when the stock was at $2.625. (The stock had been as high as $6.25 last 
year.) Gerber's feeling was that, though ADAC looked cheap relative to 
earnings, "It was expensive on a price/book value basis." Meaning the assets 
backing up the stock price "left nothing to fall back on" if trouble developed, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moral: If you own tech stocks, this is a great time for a reality check of your 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Europe's New Confidence: Eric Miller, the seasoned chief investment strategist 
at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York, recently 
returned from a trip across Europe. What he found in discussions with big money 
managers there is a significant shift in the way they approach U.S. stocks 
versus their own stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, European investors seem to be sold-out bulls regarding our 
market -- expecting it to go up but not participating very heavily at present," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, they think the U.S. remains a great place to invest, but 
they're putting their money elsewhere just the same. And that "elsewhere" is 
Europe itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, and in anticipation of the 
1992 economic unification of the Continent, Europeans' attitude toward their 
own economies and stocks has turned sharply, Miller found. "Never in the 20 
years that we have made such trips have we seen optimism as high as it is now 
-- especially in West Germany," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, the West German stock market is up about 11% year to date, 
leading all major world markets. And if German investors are worried about 
their market getting too pricey, they aren't showing it. "The German investors 
we met with are way under-invested in the United States," Miller said. "They 
wonder why they should bother when the opportunities in their own country's 
market still looked so appealing." 
</P>
<P>
"Talk of the future may have been less heady in Switzerland, Paris, Brussels 
and Milan -- but not a whole lot less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line seems to be this: There's a strong likelihood that Europe is on 
the verge of being reborn economically. That means potential problems but also 
many opportunities. Any U.S. investor who hasn't put some long-term funds into 
European stocks may be missing a great chance to make money. It's easy enough 
to invest in Europe via stock mutual funds that focus on the Continent.

Briefly: Big bank stocks got hit Thursday as Prudential-Bache Securities 
analyst George Salem changed his "hold" ratings to "sell" for several banks, 
citing growing credit problems. Chase Manhattan was downgraded and fell 62.5 
cents to $27.875. Bank of New York lost $2.50 to $31.25 on Salem's ratings cut. 
Not mentioned but falling just the same: Security Pacific, off $1.25 to 
$35.625, and First Interstate, down $1 to $32.50. Most of the stocks are 
approaching their 52-week lows again. . . . Proof that stock splits attract new 
investors: Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering, which split 2 for 1 Tuesday, 
jumped $1.625 to $22.75 Thursday, after rising 25 cents Wednesday and 62.5 
cents Tuesday.

SIMON PULLS THE PLUG ON 'JAKE'S WOMEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neil Simon's "Jake's Women" has been derailed en route to Broadway. After it 
closes at the Old Globe Theatre April 15, it won't move anywhere else -- "at 
least not this year," said Simon. 
</P>
<P>
About $1 million had been invested in the show, "and we'll lose about $600,000. 
Most of that is mine," reported Simon. Asked if the Old Globe would suffer a 
financial loss, Simon said he wasn't sure. But the Old Globe "made a lot of 
money" from his earlier play, "Rumors," he said, "so maybe they'll break even." 
(Representatives of the Old Globe were not available for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
Simon decided that "Jake's Women" "was not strong enough for Broadway. We would 
have maybe five great performances, and then three that didn't work," he said, 
referring to the Old Globe performances. "I couldn't put my finger on why it 
was so erratic." 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't have a director," he continued. Jack O'Brien replaced Ron 
Link as the director a week before the opening but was only able to work on 
weekends, because of his commitments to a KCET-TV production of "An Enemy of 
the People" in Los Angeles and the re-mounting of "The Cocktail Hour" at the 
Doolittle Theatre in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't his fault. But a play needs to be directed every day." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why O'Brien was chosen rather than a full-time director, Simon said the 
only other directors he trusted, Gene Saks and Mike Nichols, were working on 
other projects far from California. 
</P>
<P>
In O'Brien's weekday absence, "I became literally exhausted, doing day and 
night work," said Simon. "I must have written 55 or 60 new pages" since the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
All that work improved the play, he noted -- "We were about 25% (of the play's 
artistic potential) on opening night, and we raised it to 75%. But it's not 
enough, in terms of what people expect of me. We just thought it was prudent to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Advance sales for the Broadway production, scheduled to open April 30, had 
already sold out the house for two months, said Simon. "But I didn't trust the 
play enough to get by on that. I was too ambivalent about it. I feel badly 
about the cast. All of them worked so hard." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is his first play, out of 24, "that I've ever closed out of 
town."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / STAGE: DIRECTOR FINDS SPECIAL SOLACE IN UCSD PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When director Andrei Serban left his native Romania 20 years ago, it was 
because censorship made it too difficult for art to flourish, he said in a 
break between a rehearsal and a preview performance of "Our Country's Good" at 
the Mandell Weiss Theatre, produced by the UCSD drama department. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he was offered the position of director of the National Theatre in 
Bucharest by the new regime; if he takes the job, "Our Country's Good" is one 
of the plays he would like to produce there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Timberlake Wertenbaker's play, which runs through Sunday, is a fictionalized 
story about a play performed on the first prison ship arriving at the Botany 
Bay Colony in Australia in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Thomas Keneally's novel, "The Playmakers," the play's message is dear 
to Serban because of what it says about the potential for art to heal, to 
redeem and to transform, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"The convicts, most of whom are to be hanged, get an identity of their own as 
human beings through doing the play," said Serban. "Through acting comes a 
force, a strength, an inner power that they use to resist censorship and the 
political and social pressure of the officers." 
</P>
<P>
In its two previous productions under other directors, "Our Country's Good" was 
lauded in London, where it received an Olivier award for best play, and 
criticized at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles for its limited vision. 
</P>
<P>
Serban said he believes he has a better overall production here with his UC San 
Diego graduate school cast than Los Angeles or London did, though he didn't see 
the L.A. production. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope people will not be put off by the fact that it was not done well in Los 
Angeles. It's full of a very special energy here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Serban acknowledges that the play speaks to him in part because of his 
frustrations with artistic repression in his native land. For the same reason, 
he thinks the play would have a great impact in Romania now. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to do this play in Romania because I think people will savor 
every single line. It talked to me very much. I think it will be extremely 
telling there." 
</P>
<P>
But he won't take the directing position if it requires full-time residence in 
Romania. Serban, who came to the United States in 1970 at the invitation of New 
York's La Mama Experimental Theatre, is now a U.S. citizen for whom 
globe-trotting is second nature. He set out Tuesday morning for London to 
direct "Desire," a new play by David Lan set in Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
Lily Tomlin began "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe" as 
a workshop production at the Old Globe Theatre's Cassius Carter Centre Stage. 
It went on to much critical acclaim in Los Angeles and on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Now Tomlin said she plans to do the final version of her one-woman show, 
written by Jane Wagner, at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills on April 14-29 
before filming the show. 
</P>
<P>
Although no return engagement is planned for San Diego, Tomlin recently told 
The Times, "I should go back and do some benefits for (the Old Globe). Jack 
O'Brien (artistic director of the theater) has always been so terrific." 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: If "Suds," the San Diego-created musical about love in a 
Laundromat, were to appear on Maury Povich's "A Current Affair," the theme of 
the show would probably be dirty laundry. But "Suds" is slated for exposure by 
Povich's spouse on "Saturday Night with Connie Chung" Saturday night, and the 
mood of the segment sounds as if it will be right in tune with the 
light-hearted spirit of the nostalgic pastiche of '60s pop tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Chung's show this week includes a segment about singles finding love in 
laundries; she decided that clips from "Suds," playing at San Francisco's 
Waterfront Theatre, would be perfect to intercut with the reporting. The show 
airs at 10 p.m. on KFMB-TV (Channel 8). . . . William Ball, founder and former 
artistic director of the American Conservatory Theatre, will come to San Diego 
with a double assignment: he will perform in "The Cherry Orchard" at the La 
Jolla Playhouse in May and direct Moliere's "Scapan," which he translated and 
adapted, for the Del Mar Theatre Ensemble in July. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Tarwater, founder and artistic director of the Del Mar Theatre Ensemble, 
a children's theater group, once worked for Ball as an actress at ACT. Tarwater 
will be reuniting with him -- now at her theater; she will play Zerbinette -- 
the part Moliere's wife played when "Scapan" was originally done. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The new 800-seat $8.4-million Poway Center for the Performing Arts, which opens 
officially in the middle of May, will feature the Seattle Repertory Theatre 
production of "Playboy of the Western World" on June 1, and The Magical 
Moonshine Theatre, a children's company, June 3. "Pippin" veteran Ben Vereen 
will perform at a gala there June 23. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Devine, star of the new CBS-TV comedy series "Sugar and Spice," and a 
Broadway veteran of "Dreamgirls" and "Hair," will make her Old Globe debut 
starring as singer Billie Holiday in "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill," 
April 28-June 10 at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage. . . . Old Globe veterans 
Kandis Chappell, Katherine McGrath and Jonathan McMurtry will perform in "And A 
Nightingale Sang," May 3-June 10, on the Globe's main stage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joining forces: Lambs's Players Theatre, the Old Globe Theatre and the San 
Diego Repertory Theatre will present a showcase of their touring productions 
available for the 1990-91 school year from 9-11:30 a.m. Tuesday at Lamb's 
resident stage in National City. The shows range from an examination of Beowulf 
to Shakespeare to the high toll of chemical dependency. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Rebel Without a Car," a one-man show about growing up gay and Catholic in a 
small Maryland town, has been extended through April 14. It's an independent 
production at Sushi Performance Gallery. . . . Local author Charlene Baldridge 
(better known as national media director at the Old Globe) will read and 
perform selections from her work "Winter Roses," Monday at the Lyceum Space at 
7:30 p.m. Proceeds will benefit Rachel's Women's Center, a downtown shelter for 
homeless women.

Directorial Strongman: Arnold Schwarzenegger has the muscle, so to speak, to 
direct one of his own movies, but he didn't want to make his debut on a major 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he directed a 30-minute episode of "Tales From the Crypt" for HBO, 
which airs Saturday as part of the series taken from the 1950s comic book. 
Schwarzenegger's episode, "The Switch," stars William Hickey as an old man who 
swaps body parts with a younger man to attract a beautiful woman. "I didn't 
want to start out with a big movie and fall on my face," Schwarzenegger said.

Newman's Own Verdict: A jury in Bridgeport, Conn., on Thursday rejected a 
delicatessen owner's claims that he was promised a slice of actor Paul Newman's 
gourmet food companies. The Superior Court jury deliberated five hours over two 
days before deciding that Newman never promised Westport deli owner Julius Gold 
8% stock in the companies, Newman's Own Inc. and Salad King Inc., for the help 
Gold said he provided in launching the businesses. "It's just tragic, all of 
this energy and time could not have been spent in more charitable pursuits," 
Newman said after the verdict was announced. BETH KLEID

A FLIRT WITH DANGER, SUSPENSE IN 'IMPULSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
"Impulse" (citywide) is a sex-and-suspense thriller about the divided 
consciousness of a woman in a man's world: a smoky-eyed vice squad cop named 
Lottie Mason (Theresa Russell), who poses by night as a hooker, prowling the 
Hollywood streets, picking up potential johns, getting them busted. 
</P>
<P>
The basic idea, or impulse, is simple. This phony hooker, flirting with danger 
and pulling back at the last possible moment, has become fascinated with her 
own alter ego. She lives the role so well -- seeing the world through the eyes 
of both hooker and cop -- that she's gotten overly curious. Danger is about to 
suck her in: the increasingly violent pursuit of crazed drug dealers and mob 
informants on her job; harassment from the Internal Affairs division and her 
lecherous boss (George Dzundza); the subtler attacks of the boyish assistant 
D.A. (Jeff Fahey) who wants to win her love. 
</P>
<P>
The movie tries to be like its heroine: frosty-cool on top and hot underneath, 
full of sleek surfaces and nervous undercurrents. At times it succeeds. 
Director Sondra Locke uses a clean, uncluttered style. She doesn't get swept 
away in action-movie froufrou and preposterous plot twists the way Kathryn 
Bigelow did in that other tough-lady-in-distress thriller, "Blue Steel." 
</P>
<P>
Though Locke is a good storyteller -- as she also demonstrated in her charming, 
satiric fairy-tale movie "Ratboy" -- "Impulse" isn't a good story. It has an 
edge, but it lacks the steel-trap cunning or witty dialogue of "Sea of Love," 
the best of the sexy cop thrillers. "Impulse" seems more ordinary than it 
should, as if it were on the brink of something nervy and it flinched. Much of 
the story revolves around an elaborate piece of misdirection, but when the 
surprise is sprung, it seems almost perfunctory. There's no kick to it. 
</P>
<P>
A central, and crucial, motivation makes little sense. Lottie, the experienced 
cop, lets herself get picked up and paid off the job by the fugitive mob 
witness for which the entire department is searching, then runs away after 
witnessing his murder. Why? Is she more ashamed of lust or compromising 
positions than afraid of being suspected of murder? 
</P>
<P>
In the average modern cop thriller, the movie makers use the convulsive action 
sequences to paste over all the dopey, archetypal plot twists. Here, Locke 
concentrates on the story and it betrays her. It's perhaps symptomatic that its 
weakest scenes are the frigidly coy love bouts between Russell and Fahey and 
that among its best are the sadistic exchanges between Russell and Dzundza. 
Dzundza plays Lottie's superior, Lt. Morgan, a bully who cops quick feels and 
tries to threaten or cajole her into bed. It's a tricky performance, a 
demolition job on callous machismo, that he pulls off with panache. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, especially in husband Nicolas Roeg's movies, can give off amazingly 
raw, unabashed sexual vibrations. Here, she's poured into rump-hugging, 
screamingly tight dresses and peek-a-boo bodices on the job and she gets two 
levels: the cold eroticism and something softer and more woundable underneath, 
a mix of moralism and abandon. Russell is wonderful at playing jaded woman and 
cold teases. Her eyes suggest she's seen and done everything, her hips seem 
innocent and wild. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's press book, unsurprisingly, makes no reference to Clint Eastwood, 
Locke's ex-lover and longtime director/co-star; he isn't even identified as the 
director of Jeff Fahey's next movie, "White Hunter, Black Heart." Yet, it's 
obvious that Locke is straying heavily into Eastwood territory here; obvious 
also that she's learned a lot from him. "Impulse" (rated R for sex, nudity, 
violence and language) has his terse sang-froid and tight-lipped romanticism, 
his clean, inexorable pacing and his country-kid fascination with sleek urban 
rot. 
</P>
<P>
Watching "Impulse," you almost wonder whether this seemingly angry pair could 
forget the tabloids and lawyers and call a truce. They might have a few more 
good movies together left in them.

TRIO SONNERIE'S EAR-OPENER AT MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concert Wednesday by the Trio Sonnerie in the Bing Theater of the County 
Museum of Art seemed intended primarily to show off a new instrument: the 
violin. 
</P>
<P>
Not some recent, lab-developed electronic marvel but the hand- crafted wooden, 
four-stringed model that has been playing a central role in the development 
both of musical form and virtuoso performance for nearly four centuries. 
</P>
<P>
What differentiated Wednesday's program even from most period-performance 
concerts was that Trio Sonnerie -- violinist Monica Huggett, viola da gamba 
player Sarah Cunningham, harpsichordist Mitzi Meyerson -- offered works not 
from the 18th Century, but less familiar repertory from the middle- and 
late-17th, when composers throughout Europe were frenziedly exploiting the 
instrument's (and the performer's) technical and expressive potential. 
</P>
<P>
The composers involved read less like a Who's Who than a "Who?": Giovanni 
Battista Fontana, Thomas Baltzar, J.H. Schmelzer. Buxtehude and Biber seemed 
like old friends under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of two relatively formal sonatas by Buxtehude, the works 
offered proved exceedingly free in form and tonality -- call them sets of 
variations or improvisations, each demanding the virtuosity which Huggett 
unfailingly supplied. 
</P>
<P>
The British violinist is a central, influential (as teacher and performer) 
figure in today's search for authenticity. But she is no dessicated didact. 
</P>
<P>
Huggett's playing projects tremendous rhythmic vitality and technical aplomb in 
addition to scholarship. Her work on Wednesday should have laid to rest any 
lingering suspicion that those who can, play modern instruments; those who 
can't, seek refuge in scholarship. Huggett's remarkably pure intonation on her 
gut-strung fiddle is a marvel in itself, sufficient to shame many a performer 
on the intonationally more reliable, metal-strung modern instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The program also included two works not involving the violin: a soporific gamba 
suite by one Sieur de Machy (his dates, to quote the program booklet, are 
"?-?"), elegantly presented by Cunningham, and a digitally dazzling, stylish 
performance by harpsichordist Meyerson of some fascinating, at times agonizedly 
chromatic variations from Buxtehude's "La Capricciosa."

COLLINS PERFORMS COLEMAN, TYNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The music of Ornette Coleman and McCoy Tyner in the cool and elegant atmosphere 
of the Westwood Marquis Hotel and Gardens? Well, yes, in a sense. Actually, it 
was pianist and singer Joyce Collins playing the works of the two radical jazz 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it was strikingly innovative programming, and a fascinating aspect of 
Collins' Tuesday-evening performance. Working with bassist Bob Maize in one of 
Los Angeles' most civilized listening spaces, the veteran pianist ranged across 
the musical spectrum -- from Coleman and Tyner to Jerome Kern and bossa nova. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who spent six months coaching Beau Bridges for his part in "The 
Fabulous Baker Boys," has been an under-recognized artist, and it's hard to 
understand why she's been so overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the kind of lounge performance that covers a quavering vibrato with 
heavily-pedaled chords and shaky rhythms, Collins' work at the Westwood was 
that of a first-rate modern-jazz instrumentalist who sings with the penetrating 
insights of a cabaret artist. 
</P>
<P>
On Coleman's "Turnaround," Tyner's "Inception" and a bossa nova original, 
"Sweet Madness," she fashioned hard-swinging be-bop lines; on "Body and Soul," 
she somehow managed to uncover new lodes of harmony in a song that seemed mined 
to the core. Switching to vocals, Collins applied her warm and husky contralto 
to Kern's "In Love in Vain" and, most notably, to a stunning interpretation of 
the rarely heard "Job Application" (from "Ballroom"). 
</P>
<P>
Maize, whose bass maintained a solid rhythmic foundation, also soloed with 
soaring lines that countered Collins' brisk piano. 
</P>
<P>
The Collins duo continues at the Westwood Marquis Hotel and Gardens through 
Saturday and returns next Tuesday through Saturday, April 14. DON HECKMAN

BRICE BRIDGES PAST, PRESENT IN 'NOTATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back when he taught at UCLA, William Brice once tried to help a student who was 
having trouble. He couldn't quite bring off an illustration in the witty manner 
of Marcel Vertes. Brice, held in awe for his bravura Neo-Mannerist drawing, was 
no more successful in emulating Vertes' style than the student. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what our problem is?" Brice asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What?" asked the awed junior. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not French," he pronounced, striding off in dignified defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the respected Los Angeles artist has evolved into a modern 
classicist, ever mindful of the legacy of Matisse and Picasso but always his 
own man. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he carried around file cards, pencils and crayons so he could draw 
whenever moved by his muse. Now he's installed 48 of the works at the County 
Museum of Art under the title "Notations." 
</P>
<P>
They open a portal on his ruminations. He worked small but thought large, as 
anyone familiar with his paintings might have guessed. At first glance, the 
ensemble seems to promise Picasso in one of his sillier moods, scribbling away 
at the bullfights or drawing a delicious nude as casually as he flicked an ash 
from his Gauloise. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, Brice is no more capable of Iberian foolishness than he was of 
Gallic glitz. He just must be serious. Oh, an occasional work has a slight 
zingy flavor, but it's like Pop art done by a Talmudic scholar. 
</P>
<P>
What we really find here is a modern man contemplating things ancient and 
elemental. There is much of metamorphosis. A broken figure introduces a weighty 
sculptural element that moves from Henry Moore to Cycladic Greek and then 
becomes the altar of the prophets. Apollo's sun turns into the rose of medieval 
romance before it assumes its guise as a woman's sex. 
</P>
<P>
The artist installed the series and we can detect its thematic unfolding. All 
of it is bathed in L.A. light, but that light is shared by the Mediterranean 
and by the ancient Near East. Hieroglyph scribble here and there. Compositions 
take on ceremonial gravity, so that in the end they are about romance 
sacrificed on the altar of culture. (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 
Wilshire Blvd., to May 27.) 
</P>
<P>
Ecological Minimalism: If we put together two sets of otherwise unrelated 
exhibitions in beach-town galleries, there are things to be learned about why 
art works well or doesn't. Richard Long is a Briton of the international set 
who has looked better and better with time. A species of ecological minimalist, 
he's gotten down to a predictable repertoire that is consistently moving 
despite familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have his big circle of river rock, target-circles painted on walls and 
scrubbed or imprinted with the artist's painted hand. There is also a 
surprisingly touching suite of handmade papers that use mud from a dozen mighty 
rivers from the Amazon to the Indragiri. They evoke both planetary scale and 
intimate poetry. The artist seems as fond of them as of a favorite cat. 
</P>
<P>
Simplicity notwithstanding, this art brings to bear the monolithic power of 
Stonehenge, the elegance of ancient Chinese court painting and the mystery of 
Indian mandalas. Modernity notwithstanding, it communicates in the traditional 
sensual language of art, with color, shape and texture moving us viscerally to 
empathy. (Angles Gallery, 2230 Main St., Santa Monica, to April 30.) 
</P>
<P>
In the Mind's Eye: New Yorker Christopher Wool's big spare paintings seem to 
make common cause with Long, but the resemblance ends there. In one room, he 
shows six oversize white canvases with the word run or dog stenciled in black. 
In another gallery, a similar canvas is emblazoned wallpaper-style with a 
repeated pattern of a heraldic black bird. There is so little to see that 
visitors find themselves asking the proprietor if some building renovations 
under way are part of the art. They aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Wool's art belongs to an order of experience opposite that of Long's. If you 
happen to run around with a head full of texts on semiotics, you might happily 
while away hours puzzling over the meaning of it all. It appeals more to the 
mind than the eye and is that much thinner for it. (Daniel Weinberg Gallery, 
2032 Broadway, Santa Monica, to April 21.) 
</P>
<P>
A Real Vegetarian: Manny Farber is an offbeat painter who, after a career as a 
film critic, took to picturing bird's-eye views of desk-top clutter, toys and 
other intimate, commonplace items. Now he's gone vegetarian. He depicts the 
woollier sorts of legumes, either along with flowers in Van Gogh-style still 
lifes or scattered about on blocky formats. 
</P>
<P>
Work grows considerably brushier and more relaxed, so he is able to bring off a 
Post-Impressionist still-life like "Ranunculus" with easy authority. It all 
looks like straight painting but it is full of quiet quirks and private jokes. 
Vegetables done on checkered chunks of black and white live in a world half 
lacking in gravity. You can't quite tell which plants are on solid ground and 
which are floating. Occasionally, we imagine a head of lettuce has taken on 
legs and is walking toward us. 
</P>
<P>
None of it seems forced or self-conscious. It's like meeting a perfectly earthy 
regular guy who can, incidentally, recite the encyclopedia and sing whole 
operas in falsetto. Very likable. (Krygier/Landau, 2114 Broadway, Santa Monica, 
to April 21.) 
</P>
<P>
Name-Dropping: Ian Falconer also makes quirky paintings. They look like the 
spawn of some thrift-shop Raoul Dufy or Cecil Beaton wishing they were Matisse. 
Rendered in prissy, sarcastic colors, the brushwork is an awkward camp of the 
School of Paris at its most mewling. There is all manner of precious little 
jokes, like the chintzy Regency living room with an African mask above the 
hearth or the Matisse fishbowl beside a bust of Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
Falconer does so much visual name-dropping it takes a while to realize the real 
butt of his jokes is his teacher, David Hockney. Maybe it's not intentional. 
Maybe the satire is but the curdled result of a half-formed artist trying too 
hard to emulate an admired master. What a pity to waste so much effort to 
arrive at an art that feels inauthentic and spiteful. Falconer's real sense of 
style deserves better use. (L.A. Louver Gallery, 55 N. Venice Blvd., to April 
21.)

'CIRQUE DU SUNDAY' RECOVERS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a rocky start, "Cirque du Sunday," the latest show from the Groundlings 
second-stringers, isn't far behind the current efforts of the first-stringers. 
</P>
<P>
An ineffective one-joke take-off on Cirque du Soleil opened the show Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Though it was followed by a quartet of sensitive wranglers singing a clever rap 
ditty, the next few sketches were uninspired. A nerd's tour of his home was the 
show's nadir -- the one sketch where you could really tell the difference 
between first-string and second-string work. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the next sketch, about a couple of complainers at a deli, bristled with the 
energy of a raucous cartoon; credit writers/performers Corky Omine and Billy 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Rapoport followed with a surprisingly subtle examination of an Orange 
County Republican activist handling an awkward moment at a lecture, and she and 
Mary Scheer were hilarious as two smiling drill team members in a halftime 
show. Scheer changed course radically to become a voice-ravaged habitue of the 
"Ashtray Inn." 
</P>
<P>
A whodunit sketch that opened the second act was forgettable, but affectionate 
portraits of goofily enthusiastic teachers, by Sean Whalen and John Cervenka, 
were memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Shambley directed this "Cirque," including the fairly sharp improvisatory 
set at the end. 
</P>
<P>
At 7307 Melrose Ave., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $9.50; (213) 
934-9700.

'PAT METHENY SPECIAL' COVERS THE PLECTRUM SPECTRUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pat Metheny Special No. 2" is the continuation of a live performance by the 
guitarist; the first segment was aired last year. The second, running 48 
minutes, will be seen tonight on Bravo at 7 p.m., with a repeat at midnight, 
and two more showings April 15 at 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The sonic artillery at Metheny's disposal takes in both regular and solid body 
guitars, plectrum and finger styles, and the reverberant guitar synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
His adventurous work, though well received in the United States, has made him a 
virtual adopted son in Montreal, where wild-fire acclaim was accorded him at 
the annual jazz festivals and has enabled him to appear in innumerable settings 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Confusingly, this second special begins by showing him very briefly with such 
old associates as Gary Burton, Jack De Johnette and Charlie Haden; there are 
even momentary glimpses of Ornette Coleman and Carmen McRae, but the body of 
the program finds him at the Montreal club known as L'Air du Temps, backed 
simply by Steve Swallow on electric bass and Bob Moses on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Metheny's technical wizardry and potent improvisational attack are beyond 
dispute; nevertheless, it is somewhat unsettling to hear him rattle off 400 to 
500 notes per minute in a race horse tempo on "All the Things You Are," and far 
more engaging to study his lyrical interpretation of Antonio Carlos Jobim's 
"How Insensitive." The title, by the way, could well be applicable to Moses' 
clickety-click drumming on this number. 
</P>
<P>
The three-man instrumentation becomes a little tedious over the long haul; one 
wishes for a piano or horn to offer contrast. Still, the best moments offer 
enough first-rate Metheny to satisfy his substantial following. LEONARD FEATHER

BOOTLEG RADIO: LOU FRIEDMAN AND ROB RAINO GIVE UNKNOWN ROCK BANDS BADLY NEEDED 
AIRPLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Lou Friedman was struggling to start a Muzak-type service. 
These days, the Canoga Park man fancies himself a Masked Avenger of rock 'n' 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman and a friend, Rob Raino, are co-hosts of a weekly radio show on tiny 
KWNK (670). "Bootleg Radio" broadcasts one hour of contemporary rock -- the 
kind of music that plays on KPWR (105.9) or KQLZ (100.3) -- but the program 
features unknown, unsigned bands that most radio stations won't give a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We will listen to any band's tape," Friedman says. "We will play anything that 
is good rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
"Bootleg Radio" airs at 11 p.m. every Friday. The show can also be heard on 
Friedman's 24-hour music service, KLF Cable Radio, which started out as a 
Muzak-type service for restaurants. KLF now supplies Top-40 songs and news to 
accompany the program guide on United Cable's channel 30. 
</P>
<P>
One band, Misguided, recently appeared on "Bootleg Radio" and was subsequently 
invited to record several songs for a major label. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the world comes to Los Angeles to do rock. It's competitive," 
said Meghan McMullin, the band's lead singer. "Once you can get your toe in the 
door, then you squeeze the rest of your body through. Little things like that 
can happen because of 'Bootleg Radio.' " 
</P>
<P>
The program began in January, 1989, as a lark: Friedman and Raino were playing 
in bands and knew, all too well, the difficulty of getting airplay. Unlike 
other fledgling musicians, these two had what amounted to a radio station at 
their disposal. Friedman had started KLF back in 1985. He and Raino decided to 
put a weekly show on the music service and fill it with bands they'd met on the 
club circuit. 
</P>
<P>
At first, such fare reached only cable subscribers. Friedman soon approached 
KWNK, and the Simi Valley station agreed to carry the show. Most other programs 
for unknown bands are on small, college stations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like community access," a KWNK official said. "We want people in 
the community to have a way of voicing their opinions, not only during our talk 
shows but also musically." 
</P>
<P>
The show got another break from the pop duet Captain &amp; Tennille. Daryl 
Dragon and Toni Tennille, who are married, own Rumbo Recording in Canoga Park. 
After listening to Friedman and Raino's pleas, Dragon and Tennille decided to 
let "Bootleg Radio" tape in their studio, for free. Expensive equipment gives 
the program a better sound than would be possible with KLF's small production 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Vicky Camblin, who manages Rumbo, said, "The Captain &amp; Tennille were 
discovered at the Smoke House," referring to a former Sherman Oaks club. "They 
would like other bands to have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Though "Bootleg Radio" has been on the air only a year, word has spread 
quickly, and bands send in demo tapes by the sackful. According to Friedman, a 
New York band heard the show in Los Angeles and told other groups in the East. 
Tapes have been arriving from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to feature at least one out-of-state band each show," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles bands continue to dominate the weekly hour. By featuring groups 
that play local clubs -- and have local followings -- the program guarantees 
itself listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"On the night when a band is going to be on the show," Friedman said, "the fans 
will have a big party, and everyone will gather around the radio." 
</P>
<P>
And now the show is trying to be syndicated nationally. Friedman and Raino say 
they are negotiating with two dozen radio stations across the country. In a 
promotional flyer, "Bootleg Radio" offers to deliver bands that will be the new 
Guns 'N' Roses and Motley Crues. 
</P>
<P>
The Casey Lee Jones Band, which was on "Bootleg Radio" in January, hasn't made 
it that big yet, but good things have happened since they were featured. 
</P>

A pair of 20th-Century operas by Carlisle Floyd and Benjamin Britten, as well 
as a season-opening salute to the Mozart bicentennial, will mark San Diego 
Opera's 1990-91 five-opera season at Civic Theatre. General director Ian 
Campbell announced the programming Thursday morning, when he also outlined the 
1991-92 season, which will continue his three-year Mozart cycle with "Le Nozze 
di Figaro." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell will open the upcoming season Jan. 19 with Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte," 
a production that will feature American soprano Carol Vaness as Fiordiligi and 
Swedish baritone Hakan Hagegard as Gugliemo. Vaness and Hagegard are among the 
modest circle of internationally recognized singers in a schedule that favors 
younger singers still making their mark. John Copley, who directed "Le Nozze di 
Figaro" here in 1986, will return to direct "Cosi Fan Tutte," with Thomas 
Schuback conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who wrote "The Passion of Jonathan Wade" in 1962 on a commission for the 
New York City Opera, will direct the premiere of his newly revised version of 
the opera next April 13-21. According to the composer-librettist, 70% of the 
music is either new or revised, and almost half of the libretto is new. The 
all-American cast for Floyd's post-Civil War music drama will include baritone 
Erich Parce in the title role, soprano Sheryl Woods, mezzo-soprano Debria Brown 
and tenor John Duykers, who recently appeared locally in Paul Dresher's opera 
"Power Failure." Kenneth Montgomery will make his local debut conducting the 
Floyd opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Albert Herring," Benjamin Britten's early comic opera, will be produced for 
the first time by the local company Feb. 9-17, directed by Colin Graham, 
artistic director of the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. Tenor Barton Green will 
sing the title role, assisted by soprano Christine Brewer and mezzo-soprano 
Patricia Kern. British conductor Steuart Bedford will make his local debut. 
</P>
<P>
Johann Strauss' popular operetta "Die Fledermaus" will be sung in an 
English-language production March 2-10. Soprano Cheryl Parrish returns for her 
third consecutive season as Adele, while soprano Karen Huffstodt and tenor Ron 
Stevens make their local debuts as Rosalinde and Eisenstein, respectively. San 
Diego Opera's associate conductor Karen Keltner will conduct "Die Fledermaus," 
and Wolfgang Weber of the Vienna State Opera will direct. Keltner and Weber are 
collaborating on the company's current production of Mozart's "Die 
Zauberflote." 
</P>
<P>
Verdi's "La Traviata," with soprano Diana Soviero in the title role, will close 
the season next May 4-12. Mexican tenor Fernando de la Mora will sing Alfredo, 
and baritone Richard Stilwell will make his debut as Georgio Germont. Edoardo 
Muller, familiar to the local opera orchestra podium, will conduct, and 
Montreal Opera's Bernard Uzan will direct the production, which will be sung in 
Italian with Opera Text projections. 
</P>
<P>
Before the operas commence in 1991, the company will present a pair of recitals 
this fall at Sherwood Auditorium in La Jolla. German tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz 
will perform Oct. 21, and Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, winner of the 
1989 Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, will make his West Coast debut in 
an all-Russian program Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
As previously announced, San Diego Opera's 1991-92 season will begin with a new 
production of Richard Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier," with Ashley Putnam, Susanne 
Mentzer, Barbara Kilduff, Artur Korn and Jonathan Welch. "Le Nozze di Figaro" 
follows with Cheryl Parrish, Rita Cullis, John Pringle, David Malis and 
Francois Loup. Continuing the Britten cycle started the previous season, "The 
Rape of Lucretia" will present Robert Tear, Melanie Sonnenberg, Louis Otey and 
Richard Zeller.

AT THE GALLERIES: FREDMAN'S SIMPLICITY WINS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
F or more than 20 years, Faiya Fredman has quietly ob served the world, marked 
the tides, noted the remnants of past lives, both animal and architectural. A 
selection of her work from 1968 through 1989, now on view at Palomar College's 
Boehm Gallery, reveals a steady reverence for what is left -- after the waves 
recede, the volcano strikes or the wrecking ball falls. 
</P>
<P>
Fredman, who has lived near the beachfronts of Del Mar and La Jolla for most of 
the past two decades, has, during that time, shifted from a quiet, earthbound 
art to a more exuberant formalism and back again -- to a sensual, 
impressionistic form of observation. The most affecting of her works are the 
simplest, those in which she trusts her instinctual response to nature. 
</P>
<P>
In "Tideline, September 7, 1977," one of a series, Fredman's conscious control 
recedes as she welcomes the tide to compose its own image on a wide band of 
canvas coated with adhesive. Placed flat on the shore, the canvas receives the 
waves as invited guests, each one leaving behind a sandy trace of its path. 
</P>
<P>
With the canvas mounted on the wall, the contours of the tidelines begin to 
resemble those of a rugged landscape, and Fredman's act becomes one of 
empowering the Earth to create its own image. Rather than imposing her will on 
a compliant landscape, as did many of the bulldozing "Earthworks" artists of 
the 1970s, Fredman keeps to a relatively intimate scale and a tone of absolute 
respect for nature's own forms. Poetic and powerful, the "Tideline" series 
comes early in the artist's retrospective but is the show's inspirational peak. 
</P>
<P>
A loose-leaf book, "Tideline Photo Xerox," also from 1977, adopts a similar, 
diaristic format. Each dated page documents a fragment of the tideline in a 
small, black-and-white photograph and a Xerox image of the photograph. The 
photographs are at a remove from the physical, evidential quality of the 
"Tideline" canvases, and the Xerox images are even further removed from the 
gritty tangibility of the sand paintings, for they translate tidal rhythms into 
pure pattern and contrast. While not a work of much magnitude, the visual 
journal does illuminate Fredman's interest in the confluences and contrasts 
between direct observation, photographic recording and formal abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
Photography plays a central role in Fredman's work from the late '70s to the 
late '80s, and it is a natural choice, for the medium excels at grasping and 
retaining the ephemeral moment, after which neither subject nor observer 
remains the same. Fredman's subjects are, themselves, traces of formerly vital 
sites and creatures. In several works from 1981 to 1983, single, iconic images 
of beached fish and skeletal fragments float mirage-like upon sand-washed, 
tideline-imprinted canvases. 
</P>
<P>
In subsequent bodies of work, Fredman's photographs shift from a presence of 
subtle suggestion to one of declarative fact. In the "House Fragment" series, 
the artist adheres a sepia-toned print of a home in the course of demolition to 
a canvas and paints selectively over both. More ambitious in scale and 
materials, but no less emotionally spare, the "Akroteri" series frames mammoth 
photographs of archeological ruins with scraps of wire netting and sifting 
troughs. Various denotational marks such as lines, arrows and Xs are painted 
onto the photographs, overlaying the images' warm tones and softened contours 
with the cool efficiency of a scientific diagram. Three-dimensional, wood 
versions of the marks stand on the gallery floor as companions to the 
wall-mounted works. 
</P>
<P>
With each layer of randomly applied paint and decorative embellishment, 
however, Fredman effectively buries the emotional power these sites hold over 
her. Her fascination with the remnant, the ruin -- what is left -- is stifled 
by these overworked efforts at formal dynamism. This self-consciousness 
intrudes earlier, as well, when Fredman overlays several tideline canvases with 
translucent geometric forms. Though the dialogue initiated here between the 
organic, irregular tideline and the artificial, absolute, prescribed geometric 
forms sustains some interest, the tidelines by themselves are far more 
engaging. 
</P>
<P>
An extreme example of Fredman's forced formalism is the work from the "K" 
series, a huge assemblage in sand, oil, acrylic, paper, canvas and steel from 
1988. Fragments of pipes and construction materials hover together in 
meaningless union, bound by an invisible, centripetal force. In the context of 
Fredman's earlier, more delicate and sensitive work, the piece from this series 
appears especially hollow and contrived. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's most recent work seems to acknowledge the exhaustion of that last 
path, for it returns to a primal simplicity reminiscent of the tideline work. 
She loosens her attachment to the seen and ventures boldly into the realm of 
the felt. The document gives way to the impression, and a palette formerly 
bound to the earthy tones of gray and brown revels in rich, juicy color. 
</P>
<P>
"Buddali," the most rapturous of the recent works, pairs a black Conte crayon 
drawing with a lush oil painting in a single black frame. The drawing gives a 
sketchy account of an opening in a stone wall leading to a small enclosure. The 
painting beside it reads as a purely sensory response to the site, for it is a 
blistering hot field of brush strokes, fiery red in the center and cooling off 
slightly toward the edges. 
</P>
<P>
Fredman's drawings, when framed alone, lack the intensity of the combined 
works, though they do show a refreshing looseness in style. "Buddali," however, 
and "Dorgoso" again reinforce Fredman's interest in the layers of simultaneous 
experience -- here, by pairing the visual impression with the gut response. 
</P>
<P>
Though at times Fredman's show feels painfully abbreviated, with certain series 
represented by only a single work, its comprehensive quality allows the 
artist's focus to unfold under a broad variety of guises. Throughout, Fredman 
is a preserver, saving, recording and interpreting the discrete remains of an 
earlier moment or era. A small shelf of local fossils in one of the galleries 
suggests that her mission sometimes picks up where nature itself leaves off. 
</P>
<P>
The show, accompanied by a catalogue, continues through May 2.

CONCERT SHOWS BREADTH OF XENAKIS' COMPOSITIONS

Heard individually, the compositions of Iannis Xenakis assault the ear with 
their abrasive insularity. But entertaining a sampling of his music, especially 
works written for various media, brings out unexpected connections with more 
familiar 20th-Century traditions. Wednesday night's program at UC San Diego's 
Mandeville Auditorium, the first concert of the university's week long Xenakis 
festival, provided such an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"A Colone," a moving ode for men's chorus and 12 instruments, brought to mind 
the rhythmic iterations of Stravinsky and the sustained, dissonant harmonies of 
Balkan ensemble singing. Using an Attic-language text from Sophocles' final 
tragedy, "Oedipus at Sophocles," Xenakis' stark choral declamation conjured 
antique pathos aptly framed by his dense but sporadic instrumental commentary. 
Conductor Philip Larson's disciplined beat kept his forces together, although 
the 20-voice chorus did not end with the stamina and clear diction with which 
it commenced. 
</P>
<P>
Two instrumental solos focused on Xenakis' demanding virtuoso expectations. 
"Mikka" and "Mikka S" for solo violin found UCSD professor Janos Negyesy 
executing one continuous multivoiced glissando. Although its sinuous shape 
suggested an organic model, the raw sound of "Mikka" also hearkened back to the 
sonic experiments of Edgar Varese much earlier in this century. Negyesy played 
the two short works with customary panache. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive was Heather Buchman's performance of "Keren" for solo 
trombone. The San Diego Symphony principal trombonist was unruffled by its 
angular, athletic lines, and she sustained a well-focused, ingratiating tone 
even when growling out the lowest multiphonics. Despite the work's overly 
sectional structure, Buchman forged it into a broad, sustained arch from start 
to finish, and her use of mounted mutes was pure finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of UCSD music faculty member Rand Steiger, SONOR gave a 
spirited reprise of "Thallein," the 1984 Xenakis opus the ensemble performed 
here in mid-March. No less striking or demanding on a repeat performance, in 
the context of these other Xenakis offerings "Thallein" called to mind the 
percussive rhetoric of Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
It may take a long time for Xenakis to become mainstream, but the sheer 
visceral appeal of his structures may eventually win over those who have little 
patience for the mathematic metaphysics that undergird his compositions. 
</P>
<P>
The Xenakis festival continues today at 8 p.m. with a piano recital by Alan 
Feinberg in Mandeville Auditorium -- also the site for a Saturday 8 p.m. 
concert. The final concert is outdoors at 5 p.m. Sunday, on the grounds of the 
Salk Institute.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
VAN DE KAMP IS FAVORED BY DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Dianne Feinstein is the current favorite of ordinary voters, the 
political junkies who will be delegates to the Democratic state convention in 
Los Angeles this weekend think John K. Van de Kamp should be the party's 
gubernatorial nominee, The Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
That is the bright side for Van de Kamp. The dark side for the attorney general 
is that his support among the delegates seems to be falling far short of the 
60% convention vote needed to win the party's formal endorsement, interviews 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
While this might be of only passing interest to millions of voters, the 
convention's failure to endorse a gubernatorial candidate would be viewed as 
significant within the Democratic hierarchy and be somewhat embarrassing for 
Van de Kamp, who has been schmoozing party activists for years and hoping for 
their official stamp of approval to restore momentum to his underdog campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A Times survey of Democratic voters from March 23-28 found Feinstein, the 
former San Francisco mayor, to be leading Van de Kamp by 11 percentage points 
-- 35% to 24%, with a substantial 41% still undecided. By contrast, Times 
interviews for the last month with convention delegates found them to be 
preferring Van de Kamp for the nomination, by 44% to 32%, with 22% undecided 
and 2% favoring "someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, conducted telephone interviews starting 
March 9 and ending Wednesday night with 2,282 delegates, roughly 95% of those 
planning to attend the convention. The three-day meeting begins today in the 
Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
These delegates tend to be the workaholics of politics, the weekend volunteers 
who live and breathe election campaigns. Many also donate their own money to 
favorite political causes and tap friends and special interests for more funds. 
A few are among the political elite, the top elected officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
Taken as a whole, they are out of step with rank-and-file voters on many 
issues, such as capital punishment. Among the delegates, capital punishment is 
opposed by a 3-2 margin. But among Democratic voters, it is supported 3 to 1, 
the recent poll found. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the differences are only a matter of degree, such as on 
abortion. By a lopsided 8 to 1, the delegates say that all things considered 
they find themselves "more in favor of abortion (than) opposed." The Democratic 
voters also feel this way, but by 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Among the delegates, 70% call themselves liberals. Among Democratic voters, 
just 42% say they are liberals. And within the electorate as a whole, liberals 
total only 28%. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in modern history that the California Democratic Party 
has been allowed by law to endorse candidates in a primary election. 
Previously, the party purposely was kept weak, a throwback to 
turn-of-the-century "reforms." 
</P>
<P>
An endorsement presumably would generate grass-roots volunteer help for the 
winner, but the main advantage would be "bragging rights" -- the opportunity to 
stamp one's candidacy with the official party label. For Van de Kamp, it also 
would gain him new credibility and provide a much-needed victory -- any sort of 
victory -- over the front-runner, Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
By rights, these delegates should be Van de Kamp's for the asking. He has 
labored in Democratic politics for years -- attending conventions large and 
small -- while Feinstein has all but ignored the party, except for the national 
convention that her city hosted in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp in the last year has angered some influential party people -- 
mainly the legislative leaders -- by characterizing Sacramento as an unethical 
"swamp" and proposing to limit lawmakers to 12 years in office and statewide 
officials to two four-year terms. The delegates are about evenly divided on 
this term-limit proposal, the interviews showed, with Van de Kamp's supporters 
favoring the idea and Feinstein's slightly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers for both Van de Kamp and Feinstein insist that their candidates have 
not waged all-out campaigns for the convention endorsement, pointing out that 
such an effort would have cost more than $100,000 -- money better spent on 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement vote will be taken at the convention wrap-up on Sunday. To gain 
an endorsement, a candidate would have to receive 60% of the votes cast. 
Delegates also can vote to endorse nobody, a sentiment expressed by nearly 
one-third of those interviewed by The Times. These delegates said the 
convention should not be in the business of endorsing at all. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, although only 32% of the delegates said they "personally prefer" 
Feinstein, a larger number -- 39% -- said she would be a stronger candidate 
than Van de Kamp in their local area. 
</P>
<P>
And, by nearly 4 to 1, delegates described Feinstein as the "more dynamic" of 
the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is a big favorite of liberals. Feinstein is preferred slightly by 
moderates and conservatives. Delegates from Los Angeles County, where Van de 
Kamp served as district attorney, support the attorney general by more than 2 
to 1. But he also is backed 4 to 3 by delegates from Feinstein's home base, the 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
If this convention follows the pattern of most Democratic Party meetings, there 
will be a lot of soul-searching about what the party can do to regain voter 
confidence and recapture the top elective offices of governor and president. 
California Democrats have lost four of the last six gubernatorial elections, 
and no Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state for a quarter 
century. 
</P>
<P>
When the delegates were asked what they considered "the single most important 
thing the California Democratic Party ought to do to win more elections," the 
most frequently heard reply was "get out the vote" on Election Day. Next came 
party unity and adoption of a platform. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1% specifically mentioned developing solutions to crime and drugs, which 
66% of the voters in the recent Times survey tagged as "the most important 
problem facing California today." 
</P>
<P>
Delegates gave high marks to their state party chairman, former Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., approving of his job performance by 77% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
They also gave a moderate vote of confidence to veteran U.S. Sen. Alan 
Cranston, who has been rocked politically by the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
scandal. Asked for their impressions of the senator, the replies were favorable 
56%, unfavorable 41%. By contrast, a Times survey in February found Democratic 
voters divided about equally between favorable and unfavorable impressions of 
Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES VS. VOTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a comparison of delegates to the California Democratic Party 
convention and Democratic voters in general. The Times poll of the Democratic 
activists found them to be generally more liberal than rank-and-file voters in 
their party.

SUIT OVER WATCH BATTERIES IS WOUND UP AFTER 11 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
John DeTomaso, a cargo employee for Pan American World Airways, thought he had 
a good idea on how to make a few extra bucks. So, in 1978, he paid $300 for 
unclaimed merchandise that the airline stored in bins and periodically sold to 
the public sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
In the luck of the draw, two of his bins contained a surfboard, Indian-style 
costume jewelry and cheap clothing, he said. Another bin contained 13,000 watch 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Those batteries generated a legal dogfight between DeTomaso and Pan Am that 
dragged on for 11 years in California's courts. 
</P>
<P>
The case went through 25 judges, four arbitration panelists and two different 
juries. Along the way, one judge died and one of the attorneys, who spent 
thousands of hours on the case, retired. 
</P>
<P>
And the legal paper work generated by both sides filled five Bekins moving 
boxes and two file cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't believe it's over," said DeTomaso, who this week received a 
check from Pan Am for $118,931.44, bringing to an end a suit he brought against 
the airline in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't quite understand any of what happened, including the 44 cents," 
the 46-year-old Torrance resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am attorney George Henzie said the case became so bizarre that at one point 
DeTomaso "even blamed his appendicitis on Pan Am. . . . It was the kind of case 
that leads lawyers to retire early." 
</P>
<P>
DeTomaso had no idea what would lie ahead of him that September day when he 
took delivery of the cargo bins and set out to sell the batteries. DeTomaso 
said he had little success until a store clerk suggested he try a big 
electronics firm. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those twists of fate that change people's lives, he called Texas 
Instruments in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I told this woman (at Texas Instruments) that I had 13,000 watch batteries," 
DeTomaso recalled. "And she says to me, 'Gee, we are missing 13,000 watch 
batteries.' " 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Pan Am's director of security and an FBI agent showed up 
at DeTomaso's front door. He showed them the cargo bin of watch batteries that 
was stored in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am confiscated the batteries and fired DeTomaso, but the FBI dropped the 
matter, saying it had no jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
DeTomaso then filed a grievance through his union demanding that he be 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
During a grievance hearing, it was brought out that the batteries had been 
flown by Pan Am from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, where they were to be sent to 
Continental Airlines for delivery to Texas Instruments. But somehow they ended 
up in the abandoned cargo pile. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said the employee purposefully took a wrong bin, but DeTomaso 
denied the allegation, saying it was pointed out by a cargo supervisor. 
DeTomaso produced three canceled $100 checks he had used to pay for the cargo, 
as well as a copy of the inventory slip listing the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
DeTomaso was eventually reinstated, but he sued Pan Am for $8,000, the amount 
he claimed he could have made had he sold the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Nuts to you,' " said Robert Cleaves, DeTomaso's attorney. "They 
wouldn't even give him the amount he paid for the bins, $300." 
</P>
<P>
DeTomaso claimed in his suit that he suffered emotional distress and defamation 
of character -- alleging that he had been humiliated in front of his son and 
ignored by his co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a Superior Court jury awarded DeTomaso $265,000 in general damages and 
$300,000 in punitive damages. But Pan Am appealed, and the verdict was upheld 
by state a Court of Appeal. Pan Am dug in its heels again, appealing to the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The justices threw out the award, ruling that under the federal Railway Labor 
Act, DeTomaso could only challenge the airline's alleged emotional abuses 
through union grievance arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state Supreme Court gave the green light for DeTomaso to sue Pan 
Am for the value of the batteries it had taken from him. 
</P>
<P>
The case was retried and in 1988 the second jury decided that the airline had 
sold property to which it did not have title. Jurors awarded DeTomaso $4.50 for 
each battery, plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Pan Am appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"We raised 12 legal grounds for the appeal and I'm still firmly convinced that 
they were all correct," said Henzie, who by that time had taken over the case 
for another partner. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the state Court of Appeal upheld the second jury verdict. 
</P>
<P>
DeTomaso said he plans to retire in two years after 25 years with Pan Am and 
use the money for real estate investments and to start a ceramic tile 
contracting business. "I've never quite felt that I belonged since it 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pan Am's attorney Henzie: "We thought it very unfair that he was permitted 
to recover more than double what you can buy those batteries for, $1.99 from 
Radio Shack." 
</P>
<P>
But DeTomaso disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The batteries each cost $5 plus tax," he said. "I had to buy one last week for 
my daughter's watch."

OWNER CITED OVER WORKERS INHABITING BARN; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: OFFICIALS ORDER THE WOMAN TO CLEAN UP THE STRUCTURE, WHICH FARM WORKERS 
WERE USING AS A HOME EVEN THOUGH IT LACKED INDOOR PLUMBING AND GAS.

The owner of a barn north of Oxnard that was used as a communal shelter by up 
to 60 people -- many of them Mexican farm workers living in filthy and unsafe 
conditions -- has been cited for 15 violations of fire, environmental, health 
and zoning codes, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Perry, district supervisor for the county Building and Safety division, 
said inspectors who visited the barn in the 2900 block of Vineyard Avenue 
earlier this week found conditions among the worst they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst that I heard of," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner, Maria Fernandez of Camarillo, has been ordered to clean up the barn 
and keep it unoccupied or face criminal charges, officials said. Fernandez was 
unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The barn is one of the most unusual structures found to be housing people in 
the county, Perry said. Previously, code enforcement officers have found people 
living illegally in garages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is they don't make that much money, and they'll find somebody 
that'll give them a cheap place to live," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
Dwellers of the barn had been using the wooden, uninsulated structure as a 
home, even though it lacked indoor plumbing and gas. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ugolini, a zoning enforcement officer with the Planning Department, said 
about 30 men were in the barn when he visited, cooking tortillas and lounging 
on the mattresses that lined the bare walls. He said there may have been more 
tenants living there at night. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no families present during the visit, inspectors from the 
Social Services Department had been called on a complaint that children were 
also housed there, Ugolini said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be as many as 60 in the evening. I don't know that anybody really 
knows the exact number," Ugolini said. 
</P>
<P>
The property has been zoned for commercial purposes, and a dwelling is not 
allowed, Ugolini said. 
</P>
<P>
The barn had apparently been once used as a storage site. In one corner were 
discarded paint containers and a bottle of the chemical pesticide malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Williamson, a supervisor in the county Environmental Health Department, 
said the people were living in unsavory conditions that could lead to serious 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who were renting the barn had illegally constructed some outhouses, 
dug holes in the ground for use in going to the bathroom," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although county officials had razed the illegal outhouses and ordered the 
people living there to leave, two men were found there Thursday sleeping on 
filthy mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
Jackets and other pieces of clothing hung on rope strung across the barn or on 
nails. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the barn, flies gathered near a spot where the ground still reeked of 
urine and feces from pits that had been dug for use as toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Although electricity had been installed in the wooden barn, tenants had used 
propane gas to cook food. Three refrigerators were pushed up to mattresses that 
sat next to an open garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the filth, in one corner a pile of blankets had been neatly folded 
and stacked in a cardboard box. 
</P>
<P>
Pancho Cervantes, 20, one of the tenants, said officials had ordered all the 
people to leave. He said many of the tenants who lived there are Mexican farm 
workers who could find no other place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess here," Cervantes said, looking around. "It's not good." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said he came to Ventura County legally with Immigration and 
Naturalization Service documents allowing him to work as a temporary 
agricultural worker. Many of the other tenants of the barn are also legal 
workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to live in the barn with an uncle and cousins because he had no 
money for an apartment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Castro, 29, another tenant, said he had been living in the barn for 
more than a month while trying to find work in the strawberry fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to pick strawberries, but there's no work," Castro said.

THOUSAND OAKS WILL NOT FORCE WOMAN TO MOVE 
</P>

Thousand Oaks vowed Thursday not to force an 81-year-old woman to move from her 
house, which the city wanted to purchase and bulldoze to widen an adjoining 
road. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they met with Mildred Heggen and her attorney, James Nelson 
Brown, Thursday to inform her that she could stay in the house she has lived in 
for 42 years. They assured her that they would modify their road plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The city does not intend to do anything now or in the future to make Mrs. 
Heggen move from her home against her will," Mayor Alex Fiore said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Heggen said she still is skeptical of the city's intentions 
and wants a written statement signed by the council, which officials said they 
will provide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid they might be building a beautiful smoke screen," Heggen said. 
"Maybe I'm a little skeptical, but they change their minds so often. The next 
council could come in and say, 'The old girl goes.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Fiore said Heggen has nothing to worry about. "She should be free from any 
concerns regardless of what she may have read in the press or heard from 
anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city approached Heggen and offered her $379,000 for the house so 
it could widen Oakwood Drive and provide better access to a proposed civic 
auditorium in the city's multimillion-dollar Jungleland project, named after 
the wild-animal theme park that once occupied the site. 
</P>
<P>
Heggen, along with her family and friends, vowed to fight to keep the house, 
which was built by Heggen's late husband. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, Heggen's supporters collected about 400 signatures from 
residents asking the city to leave the woman alone. 
</P>
<P>
Heggen has said she wants to stay in the house in the 1900 block of Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard despite the planned development. 
</P>
<P>
"My doctor, my dentist, my beauty parlor are all nearby," Heggen said. "I want 
to stay put." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said city officials want to continue meeting with Heggen. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to live there, and we'll just try to work something out to 
accomplish that," Sellers said.

U.S. ARRESTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ON THE RISE; 
</P>
<P>
WORKERS: THE BORDER PATROL SAYS APPREHENSIONS IN VENTURA AND SANTA BARBARA 
COUNTIES DOUBLED IN A SIX-MONTH PERIOD, REVERSING A TWO-YEAR DECLINE.

Arrests of illegal aliens are on the rise in Ventura County after a two-year 
decline that followed immigration reforms in 1986, U.S. immigration officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol officers arrested 1,375 undocumented aliens in Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties during the six-month period from October to March. Most 
arrests were in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
That is more than double the 666 arrests made during the same period in fiscal 
1989, said Mike Molloy, who supervises the U.S. Border Patrol station in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said he was concerned that the increase in arrests is a sign that more 
illegal immigrants are entering Ventura County -- a notion strongly disputed 
Thursday by local critics of U.S. immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you see an increase in apprehensions like that, it's going to concern 
me as an immigration officer," Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was passed, the number of 
undocumented immigrants apprehended annually in the Ventura and Santa Barbara 
area had been rising steadily, Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the year before the immigration reforms took effect, arrests were up 
to 5,683 for the calendar year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After immigration reform laws were enacted, the number of illegal workers 
arrested in the two counties by Border Patrol agents plummeted by more than 
76%, dropping to its lowest point of 1,333 arrests in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, the number of arrests began to rise dramatically, as 2,724 
people were apprehended by the Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said changes in staffing have made a difference in the number of arrests 
that Border Patrol officers have made in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the drop in arrests in 1988, he said, was the loss of two 
officers -- nearly half the five-person work force at the Oxnard Border Patrol 
station -- for three months at the end of that year. Those officers were not 
replaced until 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Border Patrol agents departed from their regular practice of 
inspecting workplaces and focused on apprehending illegal immigrants in the 
Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy cited a special program launched Feb. 1 to capture criminal aliens. 
Since the program started, Border Patrol officers have captured 194 illegal 
immigrants who already served a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Although the focus on undocumented immigrants in jail is not new, Border Patrol 
agents have not concentrated their entire work force on undocumented criminals, 
Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is removing people who have violated our laws," Molloy said. 
"We're removing them from the country." 
</P>
<P>
A jump in the number of arrests of illegal immigrants is being seen all along 
the U.S.-Mexican border and in agricultural counties such as Ventura, said 
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We're showing increases on a monthly basis," Jervis said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, arrests of undocumented workers during the first six months of the 
fiscal year jumped by about 37% over the same period last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, INS officials have used statistics to indicate the deterrent 
effect that the 1986 law has had on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
The law allowed illegal aliens who had been living in the United States for 
years to become legal citizens under a federal amnesty program. It also imposed 
fines on employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests declined briefly after the immigration law was passed because many of 
the illegal immigrants sought legal status. Others were deterred from coming to 
the United States by fears that jobs were unavailable, Jervis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a major dip . . . because people truly believed they could not get jobs 
here," Jervis said. 
</P>
<P>
Fear has since dissipated as illegal immigrants have become aware of the 
availability of fraudulent documents that will allow them to work in the United 
States, Jervis said. The worsening economy in Mexico and continuing military 
conflicts in Central America continue to drive immigrants north, he added. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics of the INS statistics say those figures have been unreliable 
and should not be taken to indicate that illegal immigration is on the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that the number of undocumented workers arrested depends on other 
factors, such as Border Patrol staffing and changes in national immigration 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Garcia, an immigration counselor for El Concilio del Condado de 
Ventura, a Latino advocacy group based in Oxnard, said he has not seen a steady 
increase in illegal immigrants and questioned the validity of the INS 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Border Patrol kept a low profile" during the one-year amnesty program, 
Garcia said, which ended May 4, 1988. "Now that the amnesty program is over, 
they are doing their apprehensions again." 
</P>
<P>
One Oxnard city official said undocumented workers have found it relatively 
easy to stay in Ventura County without getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the immigration law has had any effect on immigration. False 
documents are easily available on any street in Oxnard and Santa Paula," said 
Carl Lawson, a community relations specialist who is working to make sure 
undocumented workers are counted in the U.S. Census.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST VICTIM'S 
WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges that a Sun Valley housewife helped an 18-year-old "street kid" stab her 
husband to death, then passed off the killing as the work of a burglar, were 
dropped in San Fernando Municipal Court on Thursday after prosecutors announced 
that they had too little evidence to win a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Richman said prosecutors did not have enough evidence against Mary L. 
Kellel-Sophiea. She had been charged with murdering her estranged husband, 
Gregory Sophiea, with the aid of Anthony Thomas Moore, 18, who has been charged 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Richman said the charges against Kellel-Sophiea could be refiled later if 
police uncover new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Kellel-Sophiea's defense lawyer, Leslie H. Abramson, accused police of trying 
"to cover up the horrible mistake that they made in arresting an innocent 
citizen."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUP TO STUDY HOW TO REVISE CITY CHARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley this week announced the formation of a group to 
study ways to reform the city Charter, including possible term limits for 
elected officials and enlargement of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The current Charter was adopted in 1925 and has been amended more than 400 
times, but has never been thoroughly overhauled, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Constitution on the federal level, the Charter spells out the 
fundamentals of city government. Bradley did not endorse any specific reform 
proposals but said a study group will be appointed soon to develop procedures 
for amending the Charter, which is expected to be a lengthy process.

Rose Carl Edelen remembers a childhood of Texas poverty in which her mother 
handcrafted her family's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Edelen, 80, of Thousand Oaks believes it was the example of her mother's labor 
that led her to a magical world of dolls and dollhouses. 
</P>
<P>
It began more than a decade ago, when Edelen was searching for a doll to give 
her granddaughter as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a new doll, Edelen found an obviously neglected one and set about 
restoring it. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprise become her singular dedication and creative passion -- sewing 
with her own hands the dresses of lace adorned with buttons, bows and 
embroidery that fit each of the more than 500 dolls she has rescued from garage 
sales and swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
They fill every room in her house, lending an atmosphere of elegance and 
reverence for things old, forgotten, abandoned and perhaps abused, but 
nevertheless appreciated anew. 
</P>
<P>
Edelen has been an artist, teacher and writer most of her adult life. 
</P>
<P>
She taught music during the Depression and experimented with constructing 
theater sets cut from corrugated boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Her passion for collecting and restoring has another side. 
</P>
<P>
Edelen said it represents a very personal inward journey "to find the little 
girl who was lost in me." KAREN CHAGI

OFFICIALS WILL SEEK TO ALLAY FEARS OF RESIDENTS NEAR ESCAPE-PRONE JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: TWENTY-EIGHT INMATES HAVE BROKEN OUT OF COUNTY FACILITY IN CHULA 
VISTA SINCE DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Brian Bilbray and Asst. County Sheriff Ken Wigginton will 
meet Monday with Chula Vista residents to explain how planned security 
improvements will reduce breakouts from the escape-prone county jail in Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, 28 inmates have escaped in three separate breakouts. The most 
recent occurred shortly before 9 p.m. Tuesday, when eight prisoners used a 
hacksaw to cut through the steel bars that cover jail windows. The inmates used 
a string of bedsheets to lower themselves 35 feet to the ground. Seven of the 
eight prisoners remained at large Thursday, a Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest escape came just a month after 13 prisoners used similar tools to 
force their way out of the jail at 500 3rd Avenue. After that breakout, the 
county spent $103,000 to bolster security. In all, $251,000 in security-related 
improvements are being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting is aimed at calming angry Chula Vista residents who are 
demanding explanations. The jail is in a mixed commercial and residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The Chula Vista City Council will meet Monday night to discuss whether it 
should act to protect its residents from escapes, Mayor Greg Cox said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although two armed private security guards are now patrolling the jail's 
perimeter, Cox said he would feel "more comfortable if, in fact, there were 
deputy sheriffs or Chula Vista police" on patrol instead. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has a credibility problem," acknowledged John Woodard, Bilbray's 
chief of staff. "We definitely have a problem right now." He said residents 
"have a right to hear what the county is going to do to improve the situation." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's 7 p.m. meeting at Chula Vista City Hall, Bilbray and Wigginton will 
be joined by Sheriff's Capt. Chuck Wood, commander of the Chula Vista jail, and 
Robert Griego, the county's deputy chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo delivered to county officials Thursday, Wood was quoted as describing 
the recent escape as "no one's fault. . . . The design of the building is 
poor." Griego said Thursday that Wood was referring to severe crowding at the 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that there are too many inmates," Griego said. "The facility is 
rated for a lower capacity, and, with the sheriff's staffing levels, it's 
difficult to keep an eye on all parts." More than 750 inmates were being held 
Monday at the jail that was designed to hold fewer than 200. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we've got a situation that is just deplorable," Cox said. "We've got a 
facility with (room) for 192 inmates and, on the night of the breakout, I was 
told there were more than 725 people" incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
Griego, who toured the facility on Wednesday, said that the $251,000 in 
security improvements laid out last month by county inspectors and the 
Sheriff's Department will "harden" the jail's security. 
</P>
<P>
The first of those improvements, including motion sensors and bars on some 
windows, have been completed, Griego said. During coming weeks, crews will 
build a fence at the top of a moat that surrounds the building and install more 
motion detectors, closed-circuit television cameras and other electronic gear 
designed to alert guards to escape attempts. 
</P>
<P>
However, some security measures might not be completed until November "because, 
legally, some of them have to go out for bidding," Woodward said. But he said 
other improvements are being speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
Griego, who will need supervisorial approval to continue with the improvements, 
said his office will authorize improvements before the supervisors meet April 
17. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ordering the designs, which would normally have to go to board for 
approval," Griego said. "In a public emergency, we have that authority." 
</P>
<P>
In March, the county authorized the jail to hire a private security guard, who 
has patrolled the building's perimeter. That guard detail was doubled after the 
recent escape, and both guards are now authorized to carry pistols, Griego 
said. 
</P>
<P>
County authorities believe the inmates who escaped Tuesday used a smuggled 
hacksaw blade to cut through bars on the jail's windows. But the contraband did 
not pass through day-room windows at the jail, as has occurred in the past, 
because the county has installed bars on those window, Griego said. 
</P>
<P>
Motion detectors, which are now in place on first floor windows, are being 
added to all windows, Griego said. The electronics are supposed to sound an 
alarm when "there's any movement in the window," Griego said. "It will pick up 
sawing, movement, any vibration." 
</P>
<P>
The external security devices are needed because, if inmates are "going to get 
that kind of equipment in there, and they're given enough time, they're going 
to be able to saw through any kind of metal," Griego said. "All we can do is 
get the technology outside to help fill in personnel" gaps inside.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICIAL NAMED TO FEDERAL 
PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An associate superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District has been 
appointed to a new federal commission charged with closing the gap between 
student achievement and workplace requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed Gabriel Cortina, 49, to the part-time, 
advisory Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills, the Labor Department 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cortina joined the school district as a part-time playground director in 1958, 
when he was 18, then began full time as an elementary school teacher in 1964. 
He served as principal of the East Los Angeles Skills Center and participated 
in Workforce L.A., a school district-private corporations joint venture to 
strengthen the connection between the schools and workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The new commission has been assigned to develop national guidelines to better 
prepare high school students for entry into the work force.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAIL ORDERED TO INSTALL GAS RETRIEVAL 
SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regional air-quality officials have once again ordered the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to install a gas-retrieval system at a garbage dump at the 
department's jail farm in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District hearing board refused Wednesday 
to grant the Sheriff's Department permission to operate the small landfill at 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho without installing equipment to siphon off 
methane gas generated by rotting garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD said state law mandates such equipment at all landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the department had sought a "temporary variance" that would have 
allowed the department to operate the dump legally until the hearing board 
could consider a request for a permanent variance on May 9. 
</P>
<P>
The board's action Wednesday makes it highly unlikely that a permanent variance 
will be granted next month.

PANEL QUESTIONS GROWTH CURBS, POSTPONES VOTE ON GENERAL PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
LIMITS: DEVELOPERS WANT TO BUILD 38,000 UNITS IN THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY, 
WHICH THE PROPOSAL WOULD RESTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planning commissioners refused -- at least temporarily -- on 
Thursday to approve a proposal that would sharply scale back plans to build 
38,000 residential units in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Planning Commission did not express displeasure with the basic 
elements and philosophy of the proposed general plan. But the commissioners did 
question how the plan, a broad blueprint for controlling development, would be 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
Is the new plan merely a set of recommendations that can be easily changed, the 
commissioners asked. Or is the plan a rigid planning document that will kill 
proposals for thousands of new dwelling units? 
</P>
<P>
To help answer those questions, commissioners asked the staff of the Department 
of Regional Planning to draw up guidelines on how the new general plan would be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed general plan would guide growth for 20 years in the Santa Clarita 
Valley, the fastest-growing region in the county for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, written by the Department of Regional Planning after several public 
hearings, was more than two years in the making. It must later be approved by 
the Board of Supervisors. The Regional Planning Commission will take up the 
issue again May 14. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners spent more than two hours discussing the complex and often 
confusing issue. "I've discovered through our conversation that I don't really 
understand what we're doing," Commissioner Sadie B. Clark said. Central to the 
debate over the new general plan are 41 requests by developers to construct 
38,000 houses, condominiums and apartments in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The 41 proposals would not be allowed under the existing Santa Clarita Valley 
general plan, and developers have asked that their proposals be included in the 
new plan. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Department of Regional Planning have said roads and 
public services could not immediately support such growth. They have instead 
recommended that only 12,500 units be allowed under the new plan, which would 
uphold a county policy to keep the valley's population under 270,000 by the 
year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, however, developers whose projects are not included in the new 
plan could come to the commission later and request amendments to the plan that 
would allow their projects to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The question facing the commissioners, therefore, was whether they would 
strictly adhere to the new plan or allow exceptions. There were no clear-cut 
answers to the question Thursday. Commissioner Lee Strong said the commission 
would still have to consider projects on a case-by-case basis under the new 
plan. But the plan is valuable, he said, because it sets the guidelines for 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're simply saying these are the rules we're going to play by," Strong said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Moore, principal deputy county counsel, predicted that, if the new plan 
is adopted, developers will not be able to obtain plan amendments as easily as 
they have in the past. "It will be a restriction on future amendments," Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the city of Santa Clarita and area community groups have 
repeatedly complained that the county routinely let developers amend the plan 
at will. In time, the community groups charge, the plan became meaningless 
because it was not followed. 
</P>
<P>
Even the commissioners agreed that developers, and not the existing general 
plan, had set the pace for growth in the area during the 1980s. Strong said 
plan amendments were granted "without any understanding of how that was 
affecting the entire Santa Clarita Valley general plan."

ASSEMBLY CANDIDATES GOING TO COURT OVER JOB TITLE ON JUNE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race for a state Assembly seat representing the west San Fernando Valley on 
Thursday went to a Sacramento courtroom, where one candidate accused another of 
overstating his credentials in a description to be printed on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A Sacramento Superior Court judge was expected to rule today on candidate Paula 
Boland's request that the secretary of state's office be ordered to reject 
candidate Robert G. Wilcox's ballot identification as an "assemblymember's 
legislative representative." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, an aide to retiring Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), 
branded the court challenge as "a shameful political ploy." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox is on leave from a post as executive director of a La Follette task 
force working to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Wilcox proposed that the June 5 Republican primary ballot 
describe him as "Assembly executive director." After the state challenged him 
to substantiate the title, he changed the designation to "assemblymember's 
legislative representative." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for Boland asserted in a petition for a court order that the 
second description still exaggerated Wilcox's status. 
</P>
<P>
"Allowing the proposed designation falsely creates the impression that Mr. 
Wilcox has a higher, more responsible position than his actual status and also 
falsely creates the impression that he has some form of incumbency status," the 
petition said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked as though what he really wanted to say was he was an assemblyman," 
Boland said in an interview, noting that Wilcox used the term "assemblymember" 
rather than "assemblywoman," which would refer more specifically to La 
Follette. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, a Granada Hills businesswoman, pointed to recent Wilcox campaign 
literature that described him as a "former field representative" for La 
Follette. "It has nothing to do with being a legislative aide at all," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, in an interview, said Boland was quibbling over semantics. The state 
has accepted his proposed "assemblymember's legislative representative" 
description, he said. The phrase accurately describes a range of tasks he 
performed for La Follette in the past four years, including his leadership of 
the schools task force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If part of Paula's argument is to imply that I'm trying to make people believe 
that I'm the incumbent, then I feel very sorry for her," Wilcox said. "The 
people know who the incumbent is." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox characterized Boland's court challenge as an attempt to distract 
attention from substantive campaign issues. He said Boland is "hibernating" and 
"hiding behind lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
Boland said: "This is an issue. Be honest with the voters out there. You've got 
to start by being honest about what your job is."

CARSON: AS ALLIANCES HAVE SHIFTED, CONTROL OF THE FIVE-MEMBER CITY COUNCIL IS 
ONCE AGAIN UP FOR GRABS IN AN EIGHT-PERSON RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, it seemed that the electoral wars for control of Carson City 
Hall had been settled. 
</P>
<P>
Political allies Michael Mitoma, Vera Robles DeWitt and Kay Calas were 
reelected handily to four-year terms, beating candidates endorsed by their City 
Council opponents, Sylvia Muise and the ailing Tom Mills. Shortly after the 
election, the three winners broadened their base by appointing political 
unknown John Anderson to the seat left vacant by the death of Mills. 
</P>
<P>
But alliances have shifted and control of the five-member City Council is once 
again up for grabs. This Tuesday, Muise and Anderson, who with Mitoma form the 
three-member majority now in control, face an election in an eight-person 
field. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers are Barbara Post, an executive for an air freight firm; Al 
Blanco, a businessman; Nathaniel (Nate) Riddick, retired from the Army and the 
Cal State Long Beach police; Juanita McDonald, an executive with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District; and Marvin Clayton, former president of the 
Carson-Torrance chapter of the NAACP. Elwood (Red) Hathaway is running a 
write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Muise and Anderson have been endorsed by the Homeowners Against Rent Decontrol, 
a well-organized mobile-home residents organization, as well as Assemblyman 
Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), and Mitoma. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt and Calas are backing Post and McDonald, as is the city employees union, 
AFSCME Local 809. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald also has the support of the AFL-CIO's political action committee, 
United Teachers of Los Angeles, local Democratic clubs, and former Mayor 
Clarence Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Muise is content enough with the city and her incumbent status to have said 
this week: "There are no major issues in this election." But the other 
candidates are discussing a wide range of issues, including the city's budget, 
racism, the influence of special interests, morale among city employees, drugs 
and gangs, as well as council factionalism and Mitoma's dominance in the city. 
</P>
<P>
That factionalism, along with the fleeting nature of recent Carson political 
alliances, were evident at a recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Calas, the longest-serving council member, expressed her disgust with the lack 
of civility in City Hall. "I am tired of people, when I walk into a room, they 
turn their back, and they won't speak to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson responded, saying he is ignoring Calas because she had signed another 
candidate's nominating petition as well as his. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are nominating against my election, I have no reason to say anything 
to you other than hello and not necessarily that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calas, who had also backed Post, responded: "I chose to back two people and I 
didn't think I did anything wrong to you. . . ." Then, shaking a finger at 
Anderson, she concluded: "I would not back you now for nothing, no." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is drawing the most criticism in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Though on the council, he has never been elected to a political office; and 
even with Mitoma as his strategist, Anderson is seen by opponents as the more 
vulnerable of the two incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Post has criticized him for supporting car phones and credit cards for council 
members, as well as a $20,000 remodeling of his council office at a time when 
the city had "to dip into our reserves for $5 million." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that the furniture in his office was "about 10 years old" and 
needed to be replaced "if you are going to represent the city." 
</P>
<P>
Post also obtained a bill from Anderson's political consultant that listed a 
$175 expenditure for "Barbara Post research" conducted by a detective agency. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he knew nothing about the bill, which is reported as a "survey" 
on his most recent political campaign report. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's consultant, Tim Carey, said the bill is genuine. He said it reflects 
money spent to do a computer search of public records on Anderson's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Here are thumbnail sketches of the candidates: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN ANDERSON 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 72, is a retired executive with Security Pacific National Bank who 
has lived in Carson since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman said he wants to increase the share of city spending for law 
enforcement "and eliminate some of our activities in the Recreation Department 
. . . perhaps the number of excursions." He also said he favors making parents 
of graffiti painters responsible for the vandalism and establishing a reward 
for reporting graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he also wants the city to concentrate on economic development, 
aggressively seeking employers, retailers and commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
With Mitoma serving as his campaign adviser, he has raised the most campaign 
money, about $28,000. He said he expected to spend between $20,000 and $22,000. 
His contributors include many of the city's major industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AL BLANCO 
</P>
<P>
Blanco, 63, a Carson resident for more than 25 years, is an electrical 
contractor who ran for the council in 1976 and in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Blanco said that, if elected, he would retain the city's mobile-home rent 
control board and would investigate allegations of "unfair treatment" of city 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized the incumbents for their record in fighting crime and said he 
would intensify the city's involvement with the Neighborhood Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
Blanco, citing his Filipino heritage, said: "I think I have a better 
understanding of ethnic groups" than Anderson, who is black, or Muise, who is 
white. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign will spend about $8,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARVIN CLAYTON 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, 47, a community relations consultant at the Carson Community 
Development Center, is running on his record as a community activist involved 
in black causes. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Carson for almost 21 years, he was a founder of the 
Carson-Torrance branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People, became its president in January, 1989, and resigned to run for council 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
As chapter president, he staged demonstrations a year ago at the Carson Mall 
after a mall executive refused to use a black as Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Clayton led a march to City Hall and staged a fast to protest 
racial discrimination in employment by the city, which is 30% black. Shortly 
after that, the city hired a black as finance director. 
</P>
<P>
He is critical of Anderson's relationship with Mitoma and said: "Mitoma is a 
dictator." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton ran for council in 1984. He estimated he would spend about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ELWOOD (RED) HATHAWAY 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway, 68, a 12-year resident of Carson, is running a write-in campaign for 
council. A retired carpet salesman and three times an unsuccessful candidate 
for council, he is critical of Muise and Mitoma and wants both of them off the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway, who has put $1,000 of his own money into the campaign, says this will 
be his last run for office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JUANITA MCDONALD 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, 51, a 21-year resident of Carson who runs the programs for pregnant 
students for the Los Angeles schools, is making her political debut. 
</P>
<P>
Her main issues are "the fiscal irresponsibility of the council; the lack of 
strong, good leadership, (and) low morale in City Hall," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald has attacked the council for approving "a deficit budget" by pulling 
money from the city's reserve funds, as well as for taking six months beyond 
the start of the fiscal year to pass a budget. "It is fiscal impropriety at 
best," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although endorsed by DeWitt and Calas, McDonald said she would be independent 
of them. She has sizable campaign contributions from labor organizations and 
expects to spend about $18,500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SYLVIA MUISE 
</P>
<P>
Muise, 50, a 26-year resident, is seeking her third full term. The hallmark of 
her campaign is her rapprochement with Mitoma, her former bitter enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The shift occurred after her council ally, Tom Mills, died. 
</P>
<P>
"She needs two other supporters on the council," Mitoma said, explaining his 
endorsement. "She has changed a lot. . . . She has become a lot more moderate 
over the last three years since I first met her." 
</P>
<P>
Replying to critics of the council's budgetary actions, she said the council 
balanced the budget "without cutting any services." The city's "reserves are 
quite healthy," and the city is working on projects that will more than 
replenish the reserves, Muise said. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman took credit for requiring city contractors to give hiring 
preference to Carson residents, as well as the expansion of youth job programs 
by Carson employers who last summer hired 120 local youths. 
</P>
<P>
Muise expects to spend about $17,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BARBARA POST 
</P>
<P>
Post, 53, a 10-year Carson resident and manager of three offices of DHL 
Worldwide Inc., an international air freight firm, is making her first campaign 
for office. 
</P>
<P>
She is critical of the council's use of the reserve fund to balance the budget 
and of Anderson as a puppet of Mitoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I might as well be running against Michael Mitoma," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said employee morale "is at an all-time low and that is due to the 
unfairness, an intimidation factor, a harassment factor and fear of 
retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
She said her campaign budget is about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATHANIEL RIDDICK 
</P>
<P>
Riddick, 69, a 24-year resident of Carson, is basing his campaign on a record 
of activism for seniors. He has been an assemblyman in the California Senior 
Legislature, a lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
Riddick said he feels that he could be a catalyst to bring together the 
factions on the council and that voters should favor him over Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"He was appointed to the City Council with no background in city government and 
no background in the legislative process prior to his appointment, and all of 
the things he cites as his accomplishments, he has ridden on the coattails of 
the things the council has done." 
</P>
<P>
Riddick's campaign budget is less than $700 and he does not have any 
endorsements -- "Not that I know of," he said.

RIO SCHOOLS SECURE NEW WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA MENDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rio Elementary School District Board has declared an emergency and moved to 
secure a permanent supply of drinkable water after a well supplying one school 
was found to contain alarming levels of nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
The district last week shut off drinking fountains at Rio Del Valle Junior High 
School and brought in bottled drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Wednesday decided to tap into a United Water District mainline at 
an estimated cost of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that high nitrate is damageable to children younger than 6 months, but 
we have nothing indicating damage to children 6 months and older," Rio School 
District Supt. John McGarry said. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrate levels in water samples were 95 milligrams in a first round of tests 
and 122 when a second round of tests was done last month. Nitrate levels should 
not exceed 45 milligrams per liter, according to state standards, McGarry said. 
</P>
<P>
McGarry said the cost for bottled water has been more than $30 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We trust the state when they say 45 milligrams is the maximum," McGarry said. 
"It is time to take precautions and not put our children at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the water hookup will begin on April 9 and is expected to be 
completed by the beginning of May. SANDRA MENDEZ

NIECE SAYS SHE MOVED MAN TO 2ND HOSPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
TESTIMONY: A STATE MEDICAL BOARD PANEL IS INVESTIGATING CHARGES THAT AN 
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR DENIED TREATMENT TO A 67-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO WAS UNINSURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The niece of a man who allegedly was denied emergency treatment at Panorama 
Community Hospital testified Thursday that it was she -- not the hospital's 
emergency physician -- who decided to take the man to a county hospital because 
he was not insured. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Laura Sulit of Arleta supported defense attorneys' contentions 
that Dr. Stephen C. Acosta did not refuse to treat 67-year-old Felix Talag when 
he came to the hospital's emergency room April 11, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta could lose his medical license if charges that he denied treatment to 
Talag are upheld by a state Medical Board panel, which has been holding a 
hearing into the matter this week in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sulit said Acosta told her that her uncle needed to be admitted to Panorama 
hospital to undergo further treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Talag went to the privately owned Panorama City hospital because he had been 
vomiting blood and felt dizzy. He was allowed to go to Olive View Medical 
Center even though his vital signs were unstable and he was bleeding 
internally, experts testified. He eventually recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The medical board has accused Acosta of illegally "dumping" Talag because of 
concerns that the man could not pay for treatment. The four-member panel is 
expected to conclude its hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
Sulit, a Philippine native who spoke in halting English during her testimony, 
said she didn't want her uncle to be treated at the hospital "because Panorama 
hospital is an expensive hospital." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Please help me doctor. I cannot afford to pay for this hospital. 
Please help me find a different hospital.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sulit said Acosta gave her the name of Olive View Medical Center after she said 
she could not afford Panorama. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very thankful that he gave me that recommendation," Sulit said. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Deputy Atty. Gen. Gloria Barrios, however, Sulit 
said Acosta did not mention that her uncle could have been treated at Panorama 
hospital even if he couldn't afford it, an omission that other witnesses said 
could have violated generally accepted standards of medical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Sulit also said that Acosta did not tell her that her uncle's vital signs were 
unstable, and that he did not ask her to sign a statement that she and her 
uncle were refusing treatment against the doctor's advice. Doctors routinely 
fill out so-called "against medical advice" forms to protect them from 
liability when patients refuse to be treated, experts have testified in the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta's attorney, John Harwell, said his client did not fill out such a form 
because he did not believe the family would sue him for malpractice. But Acosta 
was unaware that the state would take him to task for the incident, Harwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sulit testified, a Panorama hospital nurse who worked with Acosta 
testified that the doctor spent more time with patients and their families than 
did most emergency physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a superb physician," Ronald Stinnitt said. "He has a good bedside 
manner."

FOR SOME OF THE ACTORS, MOVIE ABOUT OFFICER'S DEATH IS HAUNTINGLY REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masih Modani, surrounded by a film crew at an Inglewood street corner, was 
experiencing for the third time the nightmarish day in which a .44 magnum was 
put to his head, his car and money were taken and a police officer died at his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The actual event unfolded on March 31, 1988, when Sgt. George Aguilar picked up 
Modani, a gas station money courier, at the robbery scene and began chasing the 
suspects. Modani was in the passenger seat of Aguilar's unmarked car when 
Aguilar -- the first Inglewood police officer ever killed in the line of duty 
-- cried out, "I've been shot!" 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Modani relived that day during months of testimony at the trials of 
the defendants. From the witness stand, he described again and again the 
holdup, the chase and Aguilar's fateful cry. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Modani found himself back at the corner of La Brea Avenue 
and Arbor Vitae Street where Aguilar met his death. Once again, Modani rode in 
a speeding Trans Am. Once again, he heard shots ring out. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, a director standing in the middle of the intersection 
yelled, "Cut!" The chase ended. The fleeing suspects obediently turned around. 
</P>
<P>
A feature-length documentary is being filmed in Inglewood about Aguilar, a 
Mexican immigrant who rose from a tough East Los Angeles street gang member to 
a respected law officer. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Martin Green and Glenn Bruce, the film is titled after Aguilar's 
police code name, "Victor One," which he had called out frantically over the 
radio during the chase. Bruce, who wrote the film, said a portion of the 
profits will go to a trust fund for Aguilar's 6-year-old son and other money 
will be used for police anti-drug and gang programs. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the movie unusual, Bruce said, is that Modani, the courier who was 
robbed, and the original police officers who responded to the scene will play 
themselves in the re-creation. Actors are portraying Aguilar and the five 
accomplices, four of whom are serving sentences for murder. The fifth killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Police movies are made all the time, but cops notice the inaccuracies," said 
Inglewood Lt. William Brown, a technical adviser for the film. "We're trying to 
be as accurate in this as possible. Whenever possible, we're using the actual 
locations, the actual people. This is the way it happened." 
</P>
<P>
The documentary mixes interviews with Aguilar's colleagues and re-enactments of 
the events leading up to his death. It portrays Aguilar as an aggressive 
officer who worked on the narcotics and SWAT teams, a humorous man who 
performed imitations of Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd at police headquarters and an 
adventurer who loved sky-diving and cross-country bike racing. 
</P>
<P>
The independently financed film, produced by Green's M &amp; S Entertainment, 
has not yet been sold, but the producers are aiming for cable television and 
foreign venues, especially in Spanish-speaking markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood Police Department had begun work on an in-house training film on 
Aguilar's death when Green heard the story and suggested that the police team 
up with his movie company. Officers have volunteered their time as supporting 
cast members. 
</P>
<P>
Modani called the filming a hair-raising experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the real thing isn't happening, but I'm reliving every feeling and 
emotion I had at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow police officers who responded to Aguilar's desperate calls that day have 
had to re-create scenes they say they have replayed in their minds repeatedly 
since their colleague's death. 
</P>
<P>
During filming last week, one scene was cut short when a police officer stared 
in shock at an actor's artificially bloodied body instead of following the 
director's instructions and rushing forward to pull him from the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this film is a catharsis," Brown said. "George was someone special. We 
want people to be aware how much we loved him. With this movie, something good 
is going to come from something bad." 
</P>
<P>
Officer William Cross, one of those who pulled Aguilar from his car and took 
him to the hospital on that day in 1988, said the filming has captured the 
drama of the event. He said Danny Trejo, who portrays Aguilar, is the spit and 
image of the fallen sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really traumatic," Cross said. "I start dredging up feelings like, 'Why 
did it happen to a guy like George?' " 
</P>
<P>
Trejo, who has appeared in "Lock Up" and "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," said 
he notices the emotional looks officers give him on and off camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay on the sidelines," he said. "When Aguilar's old friends see me, 
a lot of them get choked up and turn away."

CITY ATTY. HAHN ENDORSES FEINSTEIN FOR GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn endorsed Dianne Feinstein in her bid for 
the Democratic nomination for governor Thursday and announced he will chair her 
campaign in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne Feinstein proved she was an effective, capable leader while serving as 
mayor of San Francisco for nearly a decade," Hahn told a news conference. "I am 
proud to enthusiastically endorse (her) for governor and to actively 
participate in her election efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she looked forward to working with Hahn "during my campaign for 
governor and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Said Feinstein: "As chief attorney of California's largest city, Hahn has been 
on the front line of our state's most threatening problems -- gangs, drugs, 
violent crime. I commend his effort to combat domestic violence and his ability 
to allocate resources to those who need them the most." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, the city attorney's father, has not taken a 
stand in the race between Feinstein and her opponent for the nomination, state 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been helpful in advising Dianne in the past, but there was no endorsement 
made by Supervisor Hahn," Feinstein spokeswoman Kim Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has received the endorsement of San Francisco City Atty. Louise 
Renne, who was appointed by Feinstein during her tenure as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp campaign spokesman Duane Peterson said the attorney general had no 
comment on Hahn's announcement.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
</P>
<P>
PARK PLAN SENT BACK FOR STUDY, REVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After heated public discussion, the Port Hueneme City Council returned a 
10-year, $3-million parks and recreation master plan to city staff and 
consultants for further study and revision. 
</P>
<P>
The plan outlines park landscaping, lighting, restroom installation and other 
redesign projects for the city's parklands. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 5- and 6-year-olds, many of whom attended the meeting in their 
Little League uniforms, came to protest plans to move a temporary ball field 
from Bubbling Springs Park. The young ballplayers use the field between March 
and July. 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for relocation of the field to another site, away from a 
concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
The move was proposed to combat parking and overcrowding problems at the park, 
and as a solution to the safety hazard posed by palm trees in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand parents play tree guard," said Wallace, Roberts and Todd 
consultant Paul Rookood. 
</P>
<P>
"We put in a lot of hours," said Little League President Don Overholt of the 
volunteers who run the program. "We don't see them decide to just come in and 
take it away." 
</P>
<P>
Overholt was happy with the council's decision to reconsider. "They made some 
good recommendations and some good points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parks and Recreation Director Brady Cherry was also pleased with the delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that I really was asking the City Council to do too much," Cherry 
said. Council members received the document less than a week ago, Cherry said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they needed time to study the plan," Cherry said. "I did not change my 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
Changes will be made and the plan will be submitted to the council after the 
results of two other studies -- one on area child care and one on the 
feasibility of building an RV park on Port Hueneme Beach. Cherry said the 
studies should be complete by the end of the summer. KIM KASH

MANHATTAN BEACH: THE HOT ISSUE IN THIS SEASIDE COMMUNITY IS WHETHER THE CITY 
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN PUTTING UTILITY CABLES UNDERGROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lively debate over city involvement in undergrounding utility lines in 
Manhattan Beach is adding electricity to the race for two City Council seats in 
Tuesday's election. Council members run at large in the seaside city of 35,142. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Connie Sieber, 47, an airline flight attendant, and Councilman Larry 
Dougharty, 49, an economist, are seeking second terms. They are stressing their 
experience and what they see as a host of city accomplishments, among them 
three additional police officers for drug enforcement, the city's first senior 
housing project, which got under way just last week, downtown beautification 
and a five-year financial plan that has increased the city's reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The two challengers, however, say they believe Manhattan Beach has serious 
problems that demand new voices on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Stern, a 45-year-old aerospace executive, contends that City Hall is a 
closed bureaucracy where more attention is paid to what developers want than to 
the desires of residents. Artist and college student Steven A. Napolitano, who 
is 24 and an official write-in candidate, said he is running because of what he 
calls "the indifference the current council shows toward longtime residents." 
</P>
<P>
The undergrounding controversy, which stems from a pilot assessment district 
the city proposed five years ago in a beach area bordering on Hermosa Beach, 
has been simmering for months. Critics call undergrounding a financial threat 
to property owners who must bear a portion of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council once rejected forming the pilot district, it approved the 
proposal last year. The city is sharing the costs of placing power, telephone 
and cable television lines underground with 187 property owners, who pay an 
average of $4,500. Work has not been finished. 
</P>
<P>
In a move to defuse controversy over future undergrounding, the council last 
month by a 3-2 vote passed a policy statement saying the city will not promote 
undergrounding but will respond to requests of those who want it. No city funds 
will be used unless two-thirds of the owners support an undergrounding 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But undergrounding refuses to die as an election issue, with Dougharty -- an 
early advocate of undergrounding -- taking the brunt of the criticism. He 
dismisses it as juicy political fodder but nonetheless concedes he's being 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I want to underground the whole city. It's not the case. I want to 
set up a mechanism for people to help themselves," said Dougharty, who voted 
for the policy last month. He was on the 1984 ad-hoc city committee that 
advocated undergrounding in the beach area. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber, who opposed the pilot district and who voted against the policy last 
month, wants undergrounding put to a public vote. "When you have an issue of 
that magnitude, you want to be clear what the community wants," she said, 
adding that she is concerned about those who can't afford undergrounding. 
</P>
<P>
Stern also says undergrounding should be on the ballot. "Price is the key 
issue," he said, charging that the "council is cramming undergrounding down 
everybody's throats." 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano said the city should remove itself completely from undergrounding 
activities. "I want to see no city funds. Those who want undergrounding can 
form an assessment district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting community concern about so-called "monster houses" in rustic city 
neighborhoods, Stern and Napolitano charge that the council is permitting 
overdevelopment to infringe on views and open space. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano, a lifelong Manhattan Beach resident, said houses that stretch "from 
one end of the lot to the other" without yards are creating a faceless 
community. He advocates restricting house sizes to 65% of the lot size in 
low-density areas, as opposed to the current limit of 75%. 
</P>
<P>
"People are concerned about three-story blocks going up and no open space," 
Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Sieber and Dougharty say the current zoning ordinance revision 
project, which was the subject of several public hearings and council sessions, 
will attack the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber believes the project, commonly called ZORP, will reduce the bulk of 
homes, responding to "objections to houses being built to the maximum of lots." 
</P>
<P>
Dougharty said building sizes will be reduced and noted what he considers 
another important component of the revised code: neighborhood preservation 
districts that will permit specific areas to impose their own restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano, who acknowledges that he has to work harder because his name is not 
on the ballot, said he is a member of the generation that will "inherit the 
city" and doesn't want to live with the council's errors. Napolitano said he 
will spend less than $1,500 on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Calling city government "too closed, too private," Stern said he wants the 
Police Department to make the misconduct complaint process more responsive by 
having a citizens committee review complaints and make the results of 
investigations public. He said his spending will be limited to the $165 cost of 
the ballot statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber and Dougharty say they want to continue contributing to what they see as 
city progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I am enjoying being on the council 99% of the time," Sieber said. "I've got 
quite a bit of time available. I only work two days a week." Said Dougharty, "I 
have experience, I know what's going on up there." 
</P>
<P>
Both incumbents plan to overwhelm their opponents where spending is concerned. 
Sieber said her campaign will cost $7,000 and Dougharty said he will spend 
between $4,000 and $5,000.

CONGRESSIONAL RIGHTS PANEL SCHEDULES HEARINGS ON VIOLENCE AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A congressional human rights panel, expressing concern about allegations of 
abuse along the U.S.-Mexico border, will examine violence along the boundary in 
hearings scheduled for April 18 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited congressional session, announced this week, comes at a time 
when violence along the border is said to be on the rise, as is the number of 
illegal border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists along the border have long lobbied for some form of 
congressional airing of alleged abuses by officers of the U.S. Border Patrol, a 
uniformed arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and by other law 
enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials and other law enforcement agencies operating along the 
border have generally stated that the abuse has been exaggerated or that 
officers have acted in self-defense when they have shot or otherwise injured 
would-be immigrants during confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of border violence, although attracting less national attention than 
that of illegal immigration, has been exceptionally divisive in the bicultural 
communities along the almost-2,000-mile long border. It has often pitted Latino 
and immigrant rights groups against mostly white law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
After considerable delay, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on 
human rights and international organizations has agreed to tackle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're hoping is that, by taking our message to Washington, we will not 
only get the attention of the INS, but also send out a message that we're dead 
serious about putting an end to human rights violations along the border," said 
Roberto Martinez, a long-time human rights activist in San Diego who works with 
the border program of the American Friends Service Committee, social action arm 
of the Quaker Church. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't go for another decade with this kind of dismal record of human rights 
abuses along the border," said Martinez, who is scheduled to speak at the 
congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the session will lead to a reform of training 
procedures that will lessen the possibility of abuse by immigration officers. 
Another possibility, Martinez said, is that some form of improved internal 
investigation of abuse allegations could emerge. Activists have long alleged 
that officials whitewash investigations of abuse -- an allegation denied by 
U.S. and local law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Kice, an INS spokesman in Los Angeles, declined to comment on the 
upcoming hearings, but said that INS officials are also concerned about 
violence along the border. INS officials have condemned attacks against the 
almost 4,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents who are posted along the Southwestern 
border, which stretches from the Gulf of Mexico in Texas to the Pacific Ocean 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the lawmakers calling for the hearings was Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Pico 
Rivera), who issued a strong statement condemning incidents of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Reports of violence and human rights violations at the hands of Border Patrol 
agents, local law enforcement officials and self-styled vigilantes are on the 
increase," Torres said. "Shootings, beatings and harassment are unconscionable 
practices that should not be associated with U.S. government officials." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep Jim Bates (D-San Diego) was also among the congressmen calling for the 
hearing on border abuse. "I'm very pleased that the treatment of Mexicans by 
U.S. officials and citizens will be fully aired this soon," Bates said. Bates 
said he discussed the issue during a recent meeting with Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most infamous incidents in the San Diego area -- the nation's busiest 
legal and illegal border crossing -- was the shooting by a Border Patrol agent, 
in April 1985, of Humberto Carrillo Estrada, a 12-year-old Mexican boy who was 
hit as he stood in Mexican territory in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities cleared the agent of any wrongdoing, contending he shot the 
youngster as he was being attacked by a group of rock-throwing migrants. But a 
U.S. District judge later awarded $570,000 in damages to Carrillo, who suffered 
permanent injuries in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
There are no firm figures indicating that incidents of violence are increasing 
along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, there have been reports that youthful vigilantes have been patrolling 
the border in San Diego, although others have disputed the extent of the 
youths' activities. There have been a number of documented attacks against 
migrants by U.S. citizens, including the hate-crime murders of two Mexican 
migrant laborers in northern San Diego County in November 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings come at a time when U.S. officials say more and more people appear 
to be entering the United States illegally via the southwestern border, a 
situation that always results in heightened tension. In the past 10 months, 
U.S. immigration officials say, arrests border-wide -- a barometer of illegal 
immigration -- have increased by almost one-third when over the same period 
during 1988-89. In the past six months, arrests in the San Diego area have 
risen by more than half.

ACCOMPLICE IN KILLING OF MIGRANTS PLEADS GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of his murder trial, a 20-year-old San Diego man pleaded guilty 
Thursday to two counts of voluntary manslaughter in the hate-crime slayings of 
two unarmed Mexican migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bencivenga, a one-time security guard and convenience store clerk from 
Rancho Bernardo, entered his plea before San Diego Superior Court Judge William 
Mudd, who remanded him to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea bargain, Bencivenga could be sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in 
state prison and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said the two victims, shot down along an isolated San Diego 
roadside on the evening of Nov. 9, 1988, were killed solely because they were 
Latino. Their bodies were riddled with 11 rounds from a semiautomatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
The triggerman in the slayings, Kenneth Kovzelove, 18, also of San Diego, 
pleaded guilty in October to two counts of first-degree murder. Judge Mudd, 
calling Kovzelove a "cold-blooded killer," later sentenced him to 50 years to 
life in state prison and ordered him to pay a $20,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd scheduled sentencing for Bencivenga on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
The case has received extensive publicity in Mexico, where it has fed a 
widespread perception of abuse of expatriate workers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga, like Kovzelove, could have also faced up to life in prison on the 
original murder charges. But authorities agreed to the lesser manslaughter 
charges, weighing Bencivenga's critical cooperation with investigators, his 
expressions of remorse, and the fact that he was the driver of the vehicle 
involved in the slaying, not the actual murderer. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga, apparently remorseful, admitted his involvement in January, 1989, 
to an Army recruiter, who notified police. The case had previously stumped 
investigators. Bencivenga then cooperated with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The two friends were arrested in March, 1989. Kovzelove was apprehended at Ft. 
Benning, Ga., where he was training as a paratrooper -- a job he sought because 
it would afford him the opportunity to kill legally, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"We all felt from the beginning that if he (Bencivenga) had not come forward, 
Kovzelove would have killed somebody else," said A. David Stutz, the deputy 
district attorney who prosecuted the case, in a telephone interview Thursday. 
"When it came down to it, I don't think Bencivenga would have pulled the 
trigger. Kovzelove did, and would have done it again. . . . He was the 
psychopathic killer." 
</P>
<P>
In statements to police, authorities say that Kovzelove -- a fair-haired, 
slightly built teen-ager whose physical appearance contrasts with that of the 
husky, dark-haired Bencivenga -- admitted firing on the two unarmed men. 
Kovzelove acknowledged that he shouted "Kill!" "Kill!" as he shot at the men, 
police say, and that he later felt exhilarated by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
In his statements to police, Bencivenga acknowledged that he was driving on the 
night of the killings, and that he had furnished the South Korean-made assault 
rifle. Authorities say Kovzelove, crouching and wearing military fatigues, 
fired from the bed of a pickup stopped along semirural Black Mountain Road, 
near San Diego's northern city limits, in an area frequented by migrant 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Before and after the killings, Stutz said, the two men scouted the San Diego 
area in search of other Latino targets. Kovzelove has admitted a hatred for 
Mexicans, whom he accuses of taking jobs from U. S. citizens and whom he 
resents for not speaking English, Stutz said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that, if there had been five men along Black 
Mountain Road that night, Kovzelove would have killed all of them," said Stutz, 
who added that the triggerman suffers from a "classic Rambo syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Kovzelove was 17 at the time of the murders but was tried as an adult by a 
Juvenile Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd has the option of sending Bencivenga to the California Youth Authority 
until age 25, then to an adult prison to finish the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bencivenga hugged his mother and other friends and relatives 
before entering court to plead guilty. Bencivenga's mother told her son, "God 
bless you." 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga's bail was revoked after his guilty plea. Bencivenga will probably 
serve at least half of the maximum 14-year prison term before qualifying for 
parole, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims -- Hilario Castaneda Salgado, 22, a native of the Mexican state of 
Guerrero, and Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, 19, a native of the state of Mexico 
-- were homeless farm workers who occasionally lived in the brush near the site 
where they were gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
Through Michael D. Padilla, a San Diego attorney, the victims' families filed 
civil wrongful death claims against the two killers, but the claims were 
dismissed when it was learned that neither assailant had any financial 
holdings, said a spokeswoman for Padilla.

CLOUDS AND SHOWERS MAY USHER IN SPRING BREAK AS STORM NEARS SAN DIEGO

A slow-moving Pacific storm and mild temperatures promise to put a damper on 
the enthusiasm of student revelers on spring break beginning this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 students from San Diego State University, the University of 
San Diego and some local school districts are on vacation through next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Today will be dry, but skies will start clouding up Saturday, and sporadic 
showers are expected by Sunday morning, said Wilbur Shigehara, a forecaster for 
the National Weather Service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The storm is about 1,000 miles west of San Diego and will take its time coming, 
but rain may ruin part of the weekend for sun worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
This storm is the last in a series and the weakest, Shigehara said. No more 
than a quarter of inch of rain is expected from this storm, and next week looks 
dry for Passover and Easter week. 
</P>
<P>
The small amounts of rain falling over the past two weeks are by no means 
drought-breakers because it only wets the top soil, but it does help, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we don't have to water our lawns, and it's free." 
</P>
<P>
Weekend temperatures will remain quite mild, ranging from 62 to 67 at the 
beaches and 65 to 72 in the coastal areas, Shigehara said. Inland, temperatures 
will range from 70 to 76 degrees and 63 to 68 in the mountains. The deserts 
will warm up to 82 to 88 degrees, with winds gusting up to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime lows in the coastal areas will be 53 to 58 degrees, Shigehara said. 
Temperatures will range from 47 to 53 inland and 35 to 45 in the mountains. 
Desert residents can expect temperatures of 55 to 60 at night. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, crowds could swell to 80,000 people on the weekend, depending 
on the weather, said city lifeguard spokesman Lt. Brant Bass. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards do issue citations for misdemeanors but "we are expecting nothing 
close to the disturbances which take place in Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Springs," 
Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have nine beaches operating on the ocean front, and five bay beaches 
on Mission Bay will be opening up. We normally have 18 lifeguards on duty 
during the weekday in the winter, but we'll be going to 55 starting the week of 
spring break." 
</P>
<P>
Spring is one of the more hazardous times of the year because of poor ocean 
conditions, Bass said. Nine out of 10 rescues take place in rip currents. 
</P>
<P>
Beaches in Oceanside have "some of the best sand around," said Ray Duncan, 
aquatic superintendent for the city. But swimmers are not prepared for the 
cold, 60-degree water, and they have not tuned up their swimming ability, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will beef up its lifeguard staff from 4 to 14 Saturday along the 
city's 3.7 miles of beaches. It can get busy during spring break with 
attendance as high as 25,000 on the weekend, Duncan said, but it's not like it 
was in the late '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs and other areas have become more popular, and not all schools take 
spring breaks at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
As for police enforcement, San Diego will have officers on foot, bicycle, 
horseback and in all-terrain vehicles working with lifeguards from Ocean Beach 
to La Jolla, said Bill Robinson, spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any major problems in the last few years, and there's no reason 
to expect spring break will be any different this year," Robinson said. But 
"many families will be coming to San Diego, and they have a right to a pleasant 
outing without fights and shootings." 
</P>
<P>
The department also plans to implement a checkpoint for juveniles at the border 
with Mexico this weekend and next weekend, Robinson said. A law requiring 
juveniles 17 and under to be accompanied by a parent or guardian or have a 
passport will be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been our experience that many teen-agers flock to Mexico and frequently 
become inebriated, and cause problems or become involved in an accident," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana police will take offenders who slip through the checkpoint and cause 
problems to the border and release them to San Diego police for arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is not to be punitive but preserve the peace and let parents know 
where their children are," Robinson said. "When we go to Mexico, we're their 
guests."

MAN CRITICALLY HURT IN LAKESIDE BY 138,000-VOLT ELECTRICAL JOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 19-year-old man was burned over 90% of his body Thursday after he climbed on 
top of equipment at a San Diego Gas &amp; Electric substation in Lakeside and 
came in contact with 138,000 volts of electricity, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Daniels of El Cajon was listed in critical condition late Thursday at 
the UC San Diego Medical Center burn ward. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels climbed an 8-foot-high barbed-wire fence in the southeast corner of the 
Los Coches substation at Lake Jennings Park and El Monte roads, said SDG&amp;E 
spokeswoman Laura Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
He then climbed an 8-foot steel beam and touched some equipment containing 
138,000 volts of electricity, which caused an explosion, said Bruce Liska, an 
SD&amp;G manager. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard called for help when he saw the fire and heard the explosion, 
which set off an alarm at 4:11 a.m., Liska said. 
</P>
<P>
An employee responding to the alarm found Daniels with only tennis shoes on. 
His clothing was burned off and his body thrown several feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosion was 1,000 times worse than a spark you would get if you put an 
ice pick in a wall outlet which has a voltage of 120," Liska said. "The wall 
outlet would make a big flash." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E customers experienced no power outages because neither the power 
lines nor other equipment at the substation were damaged, Liska said. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, break-ins have occurred in substations throughout the county. 
Thieves have cut through the chain-link fences around the substations to take 
grounding copper wires. 
</P>
<P>
SD&amp;G offered a $12,000 reward in February for information on a countywide 
series of substation burglaries. Sheriff's arson investigators, however, said 
that there was no evidence to link Daniels to the burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we thought there was a connection, but when we got there we didn't 
find any tools," Farmer said. "He needed wire cutters. And copper wire is on 
the ground, and he was several feet above the ground."

LATE-NIGHT WORK MAY SLOW VENTURA FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: THREE OF FOUR LANES MAY BE CLOSED AS THE ROADWAYS ARE WIDENED. 
REPAVING AREAS WILL BE INDICATED.

<P>
Ventura Freeway motorists face possible late-night traffic slowdowns on 
weekends for the coming year when three of the freeway's four lanes may be 
closed as part of a $61-million widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in Van Nuys this weekend, workers will repave a 1.5-mile stretch of 
the freeway in the Sherman Oaks area with reinforced concrete. Three westbound 
lanes between the Haskell Avenue and Balboa Boulevard exits will be closed from 
11 p.m. Friday to 10 a.m. Saturday, and from 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. 
Sunday. The westbound Balboa Boulevard on-ramp also will be closed during the 
same hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect congestion that may take a few minutes longer for the average 
motorist to get through," said Jack Hallin, Caltrans' deputy director for 
construction and maintenance. "We've had very good experiences the last couple 
years when the first phase of the project was under construction. Of course, 
the trade-off is this work is needed to provide an additional lane in each 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect the added lanes will provide some relief in traffic for a few years 
but the way development out in Ventura County is going, eventually this lane 
will fill up too." 
</P>
<P>
The freeway also may be closed weeknights as work continues to add a new lane 
to each side of a 15-mile stretch between Woodland Hills and the Hollywood 
Freeway in Universal City. It is the last phase of the Ventura Improvement 
Project, begun in 1988 with road renovations in Agoura Hills. The project is to 
be finished by September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said past road closures did not cause major backups because forewarned 
motorists used surface streets. He said he expects the coming closures to slow 
motorists on summer weekend nights and mornings, but said traffic backed up 
only a mile during past closures. 
</P>
<P>
"There were backups, but because the public got the information, they tended to 
stay away or go through earlier." 
</P>
<P>
About once a week, Caltrans will release information on the times and locations 
of freeway closures. Warnings, including electric signs that flash messages, 
will be set up alongside the freeway to alert drivers to closures and advise 
them on alternate routes. Motorists may call 1-800-CALL-VIP for up-to-date 
information on closures.

COUNTY IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE FIND BODY OF MAN, 67, IN HOUSE

<P>
A blood-stained car in a Van Nuys parking lot led police Thursday to a Glendale 
house where a 67-year-old man was found dead, authorities said. "We think it's 
a homicide, but we haven't done an autopsy yet," said Bob Dambacher, spokesman 
for the county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Dambacher said the man's identity was being withheld until his family could be 
notified. He said the man was a resident of a one-story duplex in the 1400 
block of Wilson Avenue where the body was found. Glendale police said the 
investigation originated in a Van Nuys restaurant lot, where Los Angeles Police 
Department officers were summoned to examine a suspicious vehicle at 7 a.m. 
Thursday. The car was registered to a Glendale resident, and officers went to 
the Wilson Avenue residence in an effort to find the car's owner. Officers 
entered the house and found the victim inside, the report said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SYLMAR MAN FOUND GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A23-year-old Sylmar man was convicted Thursday of voluntary manslaughter for 
killing a 21-year-old Los Angeles man during an argument outside a Reseda 
restaurant last year. 
</P>
<P>
Inho Kim was charged with murdering Hong Soon Lim last April 27 in the parking 
lot of the Seoul Seoul restaurant on Louise Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But after a non-jury trial, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber said 
there was sufficient evidence only to prove voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and the defense attorney agreed that Kim, Lim and several others 
argued inside the restaurant bar shortly before Kim killed Lim by shooting him 
once in the head with a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Public Defender Randall A. Megee argued during the trial that Kim 
shot Lim after Lim threatened him and tried to choke him. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ann Korban contended that Lim was walking toward Kim when Kim shot him with no 
immediate provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Haber scheduled sentencing for April 26. Kim faces a maximum sentence of 13 
years in prison, Megee said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT LAND-USE PLAN APPROVED BY SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate on Thursday approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a bill to 
temporarily exempt cities in Los Angeles County from a tough new law designed 
to ensure orderly growth around airports, including those in Palmdale, Van Nuys 
and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Current law, which took effect this year, requires the county to formulate 
comprehensive land-use plans for 17 airports by June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Until plans are completed, cities are required to apply to the county for 
approval of major construction projects as far as two miles from airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, approved 32 to 1, the county's deadline to complete the plans 
would be extended six months and cities would be exempted from asking the 
county for a project-by-project review. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), who authored the bill, said it 
would provide extra time for the county to prepare the plans to ensure that 
building projects near airports are compatible with flight traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Among the supporters of the exemption are the League of California Cities and 
Palmdale.

A CONTEST FOR THE STATE'S MOST STUPID LAW FINDS BANS ON BLOWGUNS, DUELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The competition is fierce in South Bay Assemblyman Richard Floyd's contest to 
find the state's most stupid law. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd (D-Carson) has received nearly two dozen entries from citizens vying for 
the chance to go before the Legislature and argue why the measure they 
nominated should be stricken from the books. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was a letter from a Sunland man protesting a 1972 law banning 
blowguns. 
</P>
<P>
"Were the legislators watching too many Kung-foolish movies?" the author asked. 
Dart shooting might well occur in California in the absence of blowguns, the 
author wrote. But he added: "Any .22 rifle is a deadlier weapon." 
</P>
<P>
A Roseville man questioned a statute prohibiting sky divers from consuming 
alcohol: "Why anyone in his or her right mind would want to jump from a plane 
is beyond me. I assume beginners in sky diving could use a drink or three." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the laws singled out by contestants are obscure. A Pollock Pines woman 
raised objections to the state's seat-belt law. And an Orinda woman urged 
repeal of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"We should work for better rehabilitation programs in the prisons and abolish 
the death penalty, which only reduces the dignity of everyone," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd says his contest, launched last month, is a good way to combat voter 
apathy. To stimulate competition, he made a few nominations of his own, 
including a 1953 measure outlawing marathon dancing, walkathons and other 
endurance contests. 
</P>
<P>
"With this kind of contest, you get people thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the laws cited are more than a century old. One, enacted in the 1870s, 
prohibits the use of false whiskers. Another, enacted in 1872, bans dueling, 
providing for penalties of up to one year in jail for anyone who issues or 
accepts a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the law on duels, a Los Angeles man issued a challenge of 
his own: "You're a wimp for not fighting a duel with me. There, I said it. Book 
'em, Danno."

24 GANG MEMBERS HELD IN MURDER PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two dozen gang members, including at least one 13-year-old boy, were arrested 
on suspicion of plotting the deaths of rival gang members as revenge for the 
shooting death of their leader, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police were anonymously tipped to the revenge plot Wednesday after the funeral 
of Gerald Blockman, a gang leader in his early 20s who was shot to death late 
last month, Sgt. Al Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who received word that the group was meeting in a motel room in the 
11900 block of Washington Boulevard in Culver City, arrived at 5:30 p.m. 
Wednesday at the motel and "found these guys all huddled up in a motel room 
making their plans." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said they were ordered to come out of the room unarmed and were 
arrested.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: KIVA GRILL FEATURES STYLE AND PLENTY OF LEGUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The menu at Kiva Grill opens with black bean nachos and closes with a sabana of 
pounded steak rolled around black beans. 
</P>
<P>
The black bean appears with such frequency at this new Golden Triangle 
restaurant, in fact, that to dine in ignorance of it would be to not know beans 
about the culinary thrust of the place. There is black bean soup and black bean 
relish, and a bowl or hillock of black beans attends most entrees as garnish. 
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards who brought black beans to this hemisphere most likely did not 
foresee that this legume one day would be a fashionable adjunct to a modish 
style of cooking called Southwestern cuisine. But Southwestern is ever so 
trendy these days, as is Kiva Grill and the handsome, brand-new Aventine 
development in which it is situated. 
</P>
<P>
Like the three other eateries in the Aventine's instantly popular restaurant 
row, Kiva Grill pays immense attention to style and a good degree of attention 
to the cooking. Plate decorating counts for much, and artistic squiggles of 
sour cream and red and green sauces run across various preparations like the 
bands of color applied to Hopi pottery. 
</P>
<P>
The place is done up in the turquoise and coral shades that are virtual 
trademarks of contemporary Southwest style, and, if the emphasis seems a touch 
corny when it runs to such things as the steer skull mounted over the 
fireplace, it is likable for the live cactus plantings and the open exhibition 
kitchen. For the Indians of the New Mexico pueblos, the kiva was a special room 
set aside for occasions of ceremony and circumstance, and the restaurant 
presents itself as such a place. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern cuisine in modern parlance is one of those nouvelle things that 
doesn't mind being labeled but is terribly difficult to pin down. Certainly, it 
is based on traditional Southwestern cooking, an amalgam of American Indian, 
Spanish and Mexican styles tempered a bit by the tastes of settlers from east 
of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
As generally practiced today, it means any ingredients prepared in the 
Southwestern style, with chilies, cilantro, cumin, pine nuts and other flavor 
accents playing large roles. As defined by Kiva Grill, it involves not only 
novel approaches to traditional foods, but a lot of updated Mexican cooking 
that will be familiar to anyone who ever has bitten into a burrito or 
enchilada. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant bills itself as a grill and takes the appellation seriously -- 
even the green salsa quemada that accompanies the frequently replenished fresh 
tortillas is grilled, an unusual fate for a sauce, but one that gives the 
cilantro-based relish a deep tang of mesquite smoke. There are also smoked 
vegetable fajitas and a blackened swordfish, the latter of which sounds like an 
unprecedented case of Southwestern cooking meeting ersatz New Orleans Cajun 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The tortillas, which issue constantly from the kitchen's tortilla corner, are 
themselves a good appetizer and can be dressed with the spicy red sauce or 
orange-flavored honey butter offered as alternatives to the smoked green sauce. 
There are many other choices, though, including dressy nachos -- the crisp 
chips are made with both regular and blue corn -- garnished with a choice of 
beans, smoked chicken, steak, carnitas or lobster and shrimp; a quesadilla 
garnished with what the kitchen is pleased to call "green chile pesto" (how 
Southwestern! how nouvelle!); a ceviche of sea bass, and small tamales filled 
with chicken. The black bean soup, served as a thin and nicely textured puree, 
has a good depth of flavor to it. 
</P>
<P>
The two most notable starters are prepared at table, one of the small 
pretensions of this restaurant that pays good results. The first of these, the 
queso fundido, extends the usual melted cheese-chorizo sausage combination with 
corn relish and chopped tomatoes, which the server folds into a happily gooey 
mess and encloses in warm, soft tortillas; a little red sauce spooned over the 
filling works wonders, although the filling also is good plain. Guacamole 
likewise is prepared at table, with the server scooping the flesh out of ripe 
avocados and mashing it with cilantro, serrano chilies, onion, garlic, salt, 
tomato and lime. The taste is, of course, quite fresh, and the texture much 
more pleasing than the ready-made stuff served elsewhere. An order will feed 
several comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
The salads are entree-size, imaginative and, at $5.95 to $7.50, reasonably 
priced. The blue-corn tostada crowns a base of crisp chips with an attractive 
jumble of avocado, tomato, greens, roasted peppers and a choice of grilled 
chicken or steak strips, and the warm fajita salad extends the choice of meat 
garnish to include duck while varying the salad ingredients with the addition 
of jicama, toasted pumpkin seeds and cucumber. A vinaigrette flavored with a 
bit of jalapeno gives this salad a rather suave flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The specifically Mexican entrees run from burritos -- filled with chicken and 
mushrooms, lobster and shrimp and other items -- to chicken and carnitas 
burritos and mesquite-grilled chiles rellenos. The lobster-shrimp enchiladas 
are presented rather elegantly (if the tasty filling is somewhat sparsely 
apportioned), with bands of red and green sauce streaked across them and side 
garnishes of black beans and good, Mexican-style rice. This plate garnish, 
sometimes extended by a crisp corn cake, accompanies most entrees. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Southwestern specialties, many or which seem like basic Mexican 
dishes, range from a selection of fajitas to a chili-heated pozole verde filled 
out with corn kernels and seafood. The Santa Fe shrimp varies San Diego's 
beloved "shrimp scampi" with the addition of pine nuts to the sauce of white 
wine and garlic, and there are two styles of carnitas, including the excellent 
"soft tacos" filled not only with meat but also with shredded romaine and 
chopped tomato and onion. 
</P>
<P>
The torte Azteca makes quite a presentation piece, and is a raised cake of corn 
tortillas layered with chicken, chilies and cheese, the whole smothered in a 
burnt umber-colored sauce of subtle flavor and heat. The sabana, at $17.50 the 
most extravagant dish by a good margin, consists of a filet steak that has been 
flattened into a sheet, grilled, spread with mildly tangy red chili adobo paste 
and rolled at table around a filling of scallions and black beans. It is 
handsome, and the beef gains a great tenderness from the process, but perhaps 
it ought to be finished in the kitchen. By the time the server had done his 
work at the table, the meat was cool. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwestern theme continues to the end, with a mango "creme brulee" that 
is a misbegotten and sadly textured mess, but also with a pine nut brownie of 
wonderful flavor and richness. Like other restaurants of its ilk, Kiva offers 
specialty margaritas, of which the "Kivarita" is the lead item. Composed of 
premium liquors, it is served in a shaker; these are good, and one goes a long 
way. The list of wines by the glass, on the other hand, is ridiculously brief 
and in some instances quite overpriced.

BOARD WITH THE RULES OF STYLE 
</P>

For the professional skateboarders of Team Alva, the rules of fashion are like 
any other set of constraints: made to be broken. "You can tell a poser if his 
clothes are new and not messed up," says 15-year-old Ron Bertino of San Diego. 
"But, other than that, it's anything goes." 
</P>
<P>
This happy-go-lucky style expresses itself in a colorful array of well worn, 
funky clothes that mix the looks of hippies and punks. On a sunny day in a 
Tijuana skate park, the skaters sped by, clad in tie-dye, Rastafarian knit 
hats, neon prints and basic black. In this subculture of youthful daredevils, 
it's not uncommon to see shaved heads side by side with dreadlocks. Each 
person's individual look takes a back seat to the common ideal of skating; fast 
runs and skillful technique gain respect quicker than eye-catching clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Doyle, 22, a college student from San Jose, wears the closest thing to 
the typical skater look: Guatemalan shorts, knee pads and a T-shirt bearing the 
logo of her favorite skateboard manufacturer. "You pick clothes that are 
comfortable, that you don't mind if they get shredded," she says. "Everybody 
goes down." 
</P>
<P>
While most skaters take Doyle's approach to style, there are the few whose 
looks stand out. John Flannery, 19, favors a dress style that would make him 
feel right at home in an underground nightclub -- black vest, a black T-shirt 
and black shorts topped off with his blond hair shaved closed on the sides. 
Mario Rubakada, a pro skater whose name graces a nationally marketed 
skateboard, has turned his long, tinted dreadlocks into a personal trademark. 
"All the skaters recognize Mario," says Bertino, " 'cause of that moppy head." 
</P>
<P>
The tidbits and accessories featured in skate style usually hold some 
significance. A good pair of shoes, usually Vans or Vision high tops, become 
symbols of experience, gracing skaters' feet until they're falling to shreds. 
One particularly zealous skater, Donnie Johnson, who's been traveling around 
the country checking out skate parks, wears a strange colored tile around his 
neck. It turns out the charm is a piece of a pool in Houston, Tex., where 
Johnson had a particularly good time. "It was the raddest run of my life," he 
says with a laugh. "So I keep a bit of it with me."

CASSINI GETS HIS SMELL OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oleg Cassini seemed to have it all: a designer with a glorious past (married to 
Gene Tierney, once engaged to Grace Kelly, designer to Jacqueline Kennedy 
during her White House years) and a ubiquitous presence (his name is on 
everything from evening gowns to socks). But something was missing. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have a fragrance to call his own. As far as he is concerned, "a 
designer without a fragrance is like a knight without a horse." (A discontinued 
scent bearing Cassini's name was introduced in 1979 and produced by Beecham 
Cosmetics, according to the Fragrance Foundation.) 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a patio chair at the Hotel Bel-Air, the lithe, silver-maned designer 
says he obtained all natural ingredients -- such as jasmine, chrysanthemum, 
carnation, amber and Bulgarian Rose -- and the crystal for the bottles from two 
French firms. To blind-test his composition, he turned to 3,000 women in the 
United States. Only after 75 improvements (one for each of his years, it turns 
out), was the designer ready to put his name, Cassini, on a fragrance that he 
calls "100% mine." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his memorable Jackie clothes, including the famous Inauguration Day 
beige pillbox hat and coat, Cassini claims a number of "firsts." He was the 
first designer to put his name on licensed merchandise (for which he earned the 
title "Cassini the Greedy") and the first to give men colored shirts -- all of 
which is chronicled in his 1987 autobiography, "In My Own Fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Cassini says he also changed Grace Kelly's appearance. "I created the 'Grace 
Kelly look' for her because she was so poorly dressed. Grace was trying to give 
the impression she was a serious actress. She was purposely dressing badly." 
</P>
<P>
As for Tierney: "She was of the school that everyone could be a designer. She 
designed her own clothes and that was a disaster." After Cassini took charge, 
both women "won awards as best dressed," he says. (Tierney first appeared on 
Eleanor Lambert's International Best Dressed List in 1951, Kelly in 1955, just 
about the time each severed her personal relationship with the designer.) 
</P>
<P>
Cassini continues to "design in Italy and America," but primarily he oversees 
an enormous franchise fashion empire. He calculates that in the United States 
alone, retail sales of his men's and women's clothing, all made under licensee 
agreements, are $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of all his past and present glories Cassini regards one with special fondness. 
"The best period for me as a creative person was with Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Out of about 300 garments he designed for her, "the greatest departure from 
tradition were the beige coat and little pillbox. Everyone else was in furs and 
looked like big bears. She looked so fresh, so pretty." 
</P>
<P>
While Cassini didn't have to convince Jackie this was the right choice for the 
occasion, he remembers having to convince President Kennedy a few times. A case 
in point was a black velvet gown, with one bare shoulder, which Cassini 
defended by telling the President: Jackie's shoulders were so lovely "she 
should expose not only one but both." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Cassini's "soft power" fragrance, which he introduced 
to admiring fans earlier this week in Nordstrom's Westside Pavilion store, will 
grace the shoulders of women in 17 countries. Prices range from $35 for a 
1.7-ounce eau de parfum to $195 for a one-ounce bottle of perfume.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE; 
</P>
<P>
SOAP OPERA: DIRECTOR DAVID LYNCH'S 'TWIN PEAKS' IS THE KIND OF BOLD PROGRAMMING 
THAT IS SETTING ABC APART FROM THE COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<P>
First question: Can this be happening? 
</P>
<P>
Second question: Can this be happening on television? 
</P>
<P>
Answers: Yes and yes. 
</P>
<P>
That's because ABC has become the closest thing the United States has to 
Channel Four Television, the enterprising British network that regards TV as a 
laboratory with foaming-over beakers and test tubes, not as a rest home for 
tired ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The latest and best evidence of that is the two-hour pilot for "Twin Peaks," 
which airs at 9 p.m. Sunday (on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) in advance of the 
regular season premiere at 9 p.m. Thursday. "Twin Peaks" is a soap opera like 
no other soap opera, TV like no other TV. 
</P>
<P>
While fat, first-place NBC counts its profits and creaky, third-place CBS 
counts its aches and pains, viewers should be counting their blessings as 
second-place ABC continues to move crisply forward with some of the boldest 
programs to be found on American TV. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's record of encouraging programs that offer a true alternative -- love them 
or leave them -- speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
It was ABC that gave that bizarre Channel Four creation "Max Headroom" a shot 
in prime time. It was ABC that gave life to the wondrous "thirtysomething" and 
"The Wonder Years." It was ABC that, like Dr. Frankenstein, created those 
electroded mutants "Roseanne" and "America's Funniest Home Videos." It is ABC 
that recently unfurled that superior law series "Equal Justice" and that 
Wednesday launched a daring comedy called "The Marshall Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
And it is ABC that, against all conventional logic, is brazenly bringing forth 
"Twin Peaks" with a seven-episode commitment beyond the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The executive producers of "Twin Peaks" are Mark Frost and David Lynch, the 
film director whose credits range from that exemplary work "The Elephant Man" 
to the stunningly incomprehensible "Dune." But it's the much-acclaimed film 
Lynch is now most famous for -- the stylishly dark, foreboding, mysterious and 
satirical "Blue Velvet" -- that comes closest to being the forebear of "Twin 
Peaks," whose pilot he directed and co-wrote with Frost. 
</P>
<P>
A fictional lumber town in the Pacific Northwest near Canada, Twin Peaks 
appears to be routinely minding its business when the plastic-wrapped body of 
high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer washes ashore at a lake. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Lynch proves himself the master of the unlikely. Just as the 
discovery of a human ear was the catalyst for freakiness in "Blue Velvet," so 
does the discovery of Laura's body uncork a plethora of horrors and strangeness 
in "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
Soon Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) and FBI agent Dale Cooper (Kyle 
MacLachlan) are deep into a homicide investigation that rubs away the town's 
thin sheen of respectability to reveal its simply awful secrets of greed, 
corruption, violence and -- most definitely -- illicit sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" teeters on the very edge of exquisite absurdity. Its genius is 
that it plays both on the level of subtly ludicrous melodrama and on the level 
of a baffling whodunit, as most lines of dialogue appear to contain a hidden 
meaning, most faces a dark secret. 
</P>
<P>
There are faces aplenty, almost too many characters to keep track of initially, 
three of them played by actors (Russ Tamblyn, Richard Beymer and Peggy Lipton) 
rarely seen on the screen these days. Meanwhile, Joan Chen, who was the 
drug-addicted empress in "The Last Emperor," plays the local mill owner, who it 
turns out was taking English lessons from the dead Laura. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the characters in the first two episodes are, well, different. An FBI 
agent inexplicably adrift in an obscure murder case, agent Cooper continually 
dictates his thoughts into a tape recorder, speaking to someone named Diane. 
Poor Truman is frustrated by one of his deputies, who can't stop sobbing. A 
woman with a black eye patch keeps ordering her husband to hang drapes. And 
another woman carries around a log. When Cooper asks her a question concerning 
the investigation, she replies, "Ask the log." 
</P>
<P>
Very, very weird, and very, very funny. 
</P>
<P>
While he and Truman examine Laura's body, Cooper says to the morgue attendant: 
"Would you leave us, please?" 
</P>
<P>
"Jim," the attendant replies, blurting out his name for no discernible reason 
other than perhaps he thought that Cooper was addressing him as "Please." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it goes here. "Twin Peaks" is executed with such a straight 
face, and in such a grim, brooding environment that it sometimes takes a couple 
of beats before you realize someone here is having a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the prime-time rule mandating frequent exclamation points to keep the 
viewer from becoming bored and switching channels, "Twin Peaks" dribbles out at 
a pace that demands patience (the opening credits alone last longer than many 
programs), and its characters often move like zombies. 
</P>
<P>
With Angelo Badalamenti's portentous music as a constant ominous undertone, 
Lynch moves his camera slowly and stealthily, as if a burglar tiptoeing through 
someone's home. He plays games, lingering on obscure objects and creating the 
impression that they hold special meaning. He hones in on an electric ceiling 
fan in the home of the murdered girl, for example, and for no apparent reason, 
pauses there for a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmmmmm. A most interesting piece of television, and another creative feather 
in ABC's cap. What does it all mean? Ask the log.

MUSBURGER: CBS FIRING A 'VENDETTA'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: OUSTED ANNOUNCER TELLS ABC AUDIENCE HIS FORMER BOSSES ARE 
'SPREADING VENOM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ousted CBS sportscaster Brent Musburger told a national television audience 
Thursday night that the network's decision not to renew his contract was the 
result of a vendetta against him by CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and 
executive producer Ted Shaker. Musburger claimed they are "spreading venom" and 
out to "defame" him. 
</P>
<P>
"They conspired to get me out of CBS," Musburger told ABC's Sam Donaldson in an 
interview broadcast on "PrimeTime Live." "These two men decided I was too big 
for my britches, and that they were going to take me down a peg or two, that I 
was uncontrollable." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from CBS was muted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing to watch," Pilson said in a statement released by the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to remember Brent the way he was Monday night, gracious and 
professional," Shaker said. 
</P>
<P>
CBS announced Sunday it was not renewing Musburger's contract, which runs 
through July. Monday's NCAA championship basketball game was his final 
broadcast on the network at which he worked since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger had sought a new contract, with his brother, Todd, handling the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sham, a setup all the way -- a charade, unethical," Musburger said. 
"They led us on all the way. They sent somebody to my brother's office in 
Chicago and then pulled him off. They never intended to sign me." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger denied reports that he had sought to raise his $2-million annual 
salary to $3 million. "We never got to money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During a 15-minute interview, Musburger spent much of his time attacking 
Shaker, a five-time Emmy winner. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants puppets for announcers," Musburger said. "He doesn't want people to 
think for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger charged that after Loyola Marymount's 62-60 victory over Alabama in 
the NCAA West Regional semifinals March 23, Shaker, through a producer, told 
Musburger not to mention the late Hank Gathers, the Loyola star who died March 
4, on the next broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Shaker has worked for CBS Sports since 1978. His assignments have included 
producing "The NFL Today" and CBS' NBA and NCAA tournament coverage. Musburger 
has served as host or announcer for all those events. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger had been under fire from television critics for several years for 
appearing on too many events. In recent years, CBS had reduced his workload, 
dropping him as the play-by-play announcer from the NBA and as the host of the 
Masters golf telecasts. However, Musburger told Donaldson it was not his idea, 
but requests by CBS executives that led him to broadcast more events. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Chirkinian (who produces and directs CBS' golf telecasts) came to me and 
said we lost Vin Scully (to NBC) and needed a story-teller. 'Would you come in 
and help out?' " Musburger said. "On (tennis') U.S. Open, Van Gordon Sauter 
(then-CBS Sports president) said we've got to put together a half-hour show." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger's future has been the subject of much conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going someplace," Musburger said. "I'll sit back and take a look at the 
offers. You don't have to pay me $2 million a year."

leaders," said Peter Jacobsen -- golfer, comedian, winner of (appropriately) 
Bob Hope's tournament and PGA Tour raconteur, not to mention composer, lead 
singer and guitar picker of the Grammy-losing recording group, Jake Trout and 
the Flounders. 
</P>
<P>
Never before, we dare say, in the long and stuffy history of the Masters, had 
any player plopped down into a chair at his news conference and promptly 
commenced to spitting into his microphone like a rap musician, as Jacobsen did 
Thursday after his opening-round 67. Needless to say, assorted august Augustans 
stared at Jacobsen as though he needed to be fitted for a straitjacket, not a 
green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"Pppp-pp-pp-pp," Jacobsen spat. "I can't rap . . . like no other . . . 'cause 
can't you see . . . I ain't no soul brother? Pppp-pp-pp-pp." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Yates, venerable chairman of the Masters press committee, sat bug-eyed 
next to this 36-year-old goofy golfer, looking as though he had just spied a 
UFO. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know rap?" Jacobsen turned to him and asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Just barely," Yates replied, with a drawl thick as Georgia clay. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jacobsen, the golfer from another planet, withdrew from the Masters, as 
well as the British Open, three years ago in anguish over a ruptured disk. Now, 
he's just swinging along, singing a song, chirping like a birdie, captivating 
galleries with his standup patter and even picking himself to win the Masters 
-- no foolin'. 
</P>
<P>
"On what grounds?" somebody asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What grounds!" Jacobsen yelped. "Take a look at that scoreboard, pal! Them 
grounds!" 
</P>
<P>
And away he went, ramblin' on about his round, addressing the ball with all the 
seriousness of Ed Norton -- "Hello, ball" -- embellishing his fantasy of 
becoming one of golfdom's greats, inevitably working the conversation around to 
the offbeat musical trio he formed with Mark Lye on vocals and Payne Stewart on 
harmonica that cut an album satirizing popular songs. You know, like their 
version of Otis Redding's "Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay." The one that goes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hittin' on the back of the range, 
</P>
<P>
 "Tryin' to play like Curtis Strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a ruptured disc. There also are parodies of artists ranging from 
Bobby McFerrin -- "Don't Worry, Keep Swinging" -- to Jim Morrison and the Doors 
-- "Grinders on the Tour" -- on this, Jake Trout and the Flounders' debut 
recording. What else might we expect from a golfer as beyond-the-fringe as 
Jacobsen, who for years has entertained spectators and playing partners alike 
with his impersonations of PGA stars. 
</P>
<P>
"People still come up to me every day and say: 'Do Arnold!' or 'Do Stadler!' " 
Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
On the course, he finds himself outdoing Arnie, outdoing the Walrus. His 
pretty, five-under-par round Thursday included a sand blast at No. 2 to within 
three inches of the hole and a self-described "chicken-hearted" lag in front of 
the creek at No. 13 that led him to a nice, safe birdie, on the very same hole 
where Paul Azinger later took an ugly 10. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, that reminded Jacobsen of a story: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing the British a few years ago (in 1985) at Royal St. George, and I'm 
doin' real well, six or seven under, except I made a nine at the 14th hole, 
which is a par five. So, I start moanin' later about my one bad hole, and this 
Scottish old-timer comes up to me with his thick brogue and says: 'Petuh, 
theh's no sich thing as pahs, buddies or bogeys. Theh's jist noombers.' 
</P>
<P>
"And that's how I look at it now. There are no pars, birdies or bogeys -- just 
numbers. Just string 'em together and add 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
There must be some cosmic significance in there somewhere, but perhaps only 
Peter Erling Jacobsen is able to interpret it. He definitely hears his own 
drummer. Only he, for example, feels better sitting in third place than in 
first because of all of those previous first-round Masters leaders from Robert 
Wrenn to Bill Kratzert to Gary Hallberg who, figuratively speaking, ended up in 
the slums of Chicago instead of in the winner's circle of Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
Since it is somewhat difficult at times to describe Jacobsen, about all you 
could do Thursday was ask him to describe himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, that's your job," he said. "You can pull out that thesaurus of yours, 
can't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Just one adjective, at least? 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, OK, I dunno . . . Masters champion? " Jacobsen said. "No, that's not much 
of an adjective. 
</P>
<P>
"Unpredictable, maybe? 
</P>
<P>
"Great putter?" 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen sat there, trying to think of some more, something more suitable, 
something appropriate to his personality. 
</P>
<P>
"I give up," he finally said. "Rapmaster?"

FLAMBOYANT PEREZ WEARS HIS MILLIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Some observations, notes, quotes and tidbits as the abbreviated spring training 
comes to an inconclusive conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner must be hoping his new pitcher, 
Pascual Perez, is worth his gold in wins. When Perez finally arrived in camp he 
appeared to be wearing most of the $5.7 million Steinbrenner had given him 
around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
As if that wasn't enough to get The Boss' attention, Perez was hiding most of 
his gold under long, shaggy hair that stretched to his shoulders. In addition 
to having Dock Ellis travel as his confidant, Perez also may need a personal 
valet and bodyguard -- especially if he wears as much jewelry on the streets of 
New York as he has on the playing fields of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly is making noises again about leaving the Yankees when his 
contract expires at the end of the year. The first baseman, who will make $2.5 
million in the last year of his contract, is unhappy because Steinbrenner has 
dragged his feet in negotiations. Mattingly says a new deal must be done before 
Opening Day. Look for Mattingly to command a $20 million, five-year deal, 
surpassing the $16 million, four-year contract the San Francisco Giants gave 
Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
In a concession to his emotional stability, Sparky Anderson has vowed to cut 
back on his demanding schedule. But the Detroit Tigers manager has not lost his 
enthusiasm -- or his zest for the overstatement. 
</P>
<P>
After Cecil Fielder hit three home runs in an early exhibition against St. 
Louis, Anderson said the former Toronto Blue Jay would be his fourth-place 
hitter this season. Fielder is fresh from Japan, which might be the only place 
other than Florida where his home runs would have cleared the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"All three would have been outs in Tiger Stadium," said an unimpressed Whitey 
Herzog, the St. Louis Cardinals' manager. 
</P>
<P>
Two encouraging aspects of Jay Tibbs' comeback effort with the Baltimore 
Orioles have nothing to do with his six scoreless innings. In his third inning 
of work against the Atlanta Braves two days ago, every batter hit the ball 
hard, but in his final inning Tibbs threw better than he did in the other 
three. In addition, the right-hander's fastball started at 84 mph, stepped up 
to 86, and peaked at 90. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees easily won the award for the worst public relations move of the 
spring. Refunds for exhibition games canceled because of the lockout were 
generally available only on days the Yankees were on the road, thus no need for 
fans to come to the park. 
</P>
<P>
On game days the refund office was open occasionally, but it is located inside 
the turnstiles and a ticket purchase was necessary to get that far. Nobody was 
allowed inside simply to refund a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets figured they solved their inner turmoil of a year ago by 
failing to renew the contracts of veterans Keith Hernandez and catcher Gary 
Carter, and opening up playing time for their younger players. But if the Mets 
don't make a trade, Manager Davey Johnson still will have to deal with the 
grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Bob Ojeda has been sent to the bullpen, and the acquisition of Mike 
Marshall has made a reserve out of Dave Magadan. Neither Ojeda nor Magadan is 
happy, so the harmony might be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Myers, the Orioles' promising left-hander, did not get his wish to start 
the season with triple A Rochester; he will go north with double A Hagerstown. 
Although he is not as upset as a year ago when he opened with single A 
Frederick, Myers made his concerns known to Doug Melvin, the Orioles' director 
of player development. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he didn't want his age (21 this month) to hold him back," Melvin 
said. "I explained to him that he had only a little over 100 innings at Double 
A (last year). 
</P>
<P>
"We did the same thing with (Bob) Milacki two years ago, and it worked out 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Myers and Baltimorean Mike Linskey, also sent to Hagerstown, are in similar 
situations, according to Melvin. "What we're looking for is them to go out and 
get off to a quick start in double A, win three out of four or four out of 
five. Then I'd have no problem moving them up." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently the Orioles have few reservations about David Segui, who is being 
hailed as the first baseman of the future. The best bargain in the system 
($1,000 bonus as an undrafted free agent), Segui has played only a half-season 
at double A, and is moving through the system at the same pace Steve Finley did 
a couple of years ago. The main reason the Orioles released Francisco Melendez 
was because they did not want to impede Segui's progress. He is the son of 
former major-leaguer Diego Segui.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The highway between Banff and Calgary was treacherous Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The bus moved cautiously through the Canadian Rockies, its tires seeking 
traction on a road slick with a sheet of ice. 
</P>
<P>
But inside there was only laughter. An Eddie Murphy video played on a big 
screen. A stunning victory was being replayed in the heads of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had come down to Calgary from their mountain retreat earlier in the 
day, assured by all that they were heading for defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames in the opener of a 
best-of-seven playoff series without Wayne Gretzky? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Kings were heading back to their training site in Banff having the last 
laugh after coming from behind with four third-period goals to win the opener, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure felt good on the ride home," said Luc Robitaille, who scored two 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, however, the mood had mellowed. 
</P>
<P>
Banff is a holiday town. Skiers move easily across picture-postcard mountains. 
Vacationers snap shots of elk running through the forests. Tourists jam the 
colorful shops and restaurants along Banff Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Banff Recreation Center, where the Kings train, it was all business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back on Earth," defenseman Steve Duchesne said. "We're back in the real 
world. We know we have to win four times." 
</P>
<P>
There was conjecture before this series began that if the Kings lost the first 
two games and looked hopelessly out of the series, the club might choose not to 
use Gretzky at all, allowing him to heal his back injury in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Kings' chances and Gretzky's back much improved, it is likely 
he'll play Sunday when the series switches to the Forum for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
"My back is 100% better," Gretzky said by phone from his Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
He is hoping to skate today for the first time since he injured the back 
against the New York Islanders on March. 22. If that workout goes well, he'll 
practice with the team Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Anything would be better than viewing the playoffs on television, as Gretzky 
did Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to play," he said. "I don't like to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I've ever been as excited. The guys should be proud, yet this 
thing is a long way from being over. I'm happy for (owner) Bruce (McNall), 
(General Manager) Rogie (Vachon) and (Coach) Tom (Webster). They took a lot of 
heat during the year, along with the heat over the Bernie (Nicholls) trade." 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked Webster about Gretzky Thursday, he responded loudly: "Let 
it go! Why are you always asking about Gretzky? Leave it alone!" 
</P>
<P>
His mood was not one of anger, but playfulness. Why not? He had endured a 
season of injury and criticism to coach his first playoff victory after 
finishing fourth in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll deal with (Gretzky's return) when it happens," Webster said. "I hope it 
happens. But we can't deal with it now. We have to stay with what's going well 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
With Gretzky missing, the Kings have asked for leadership from veteran 
defenseman Larry Robinson, who is appearing in his 18th Stanley Cup playoff. 
Robinson responds by stressing a low-key approach. 
</P>
<P>
"You're all right as long as you don't get too much of an emotional high or 
low," he said. "You have to keep it in perspective. In the playoffs, there's 
more hype each game, each shift. You can't get too caught up in it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was the voice the Kings heard when things got tense Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were down, 3-1," Robitaille said, "we were scared a little. And even 
when we got up, 4-3, it was Larry who said, 'Let's cool down. Let us play our 
game and we know we are going to win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille has a message of his own for his teammates, which he plans to 
deliver tonight before Game 2 in Calgary's Olympic Saddledome (at 6:30, PDT, on 
Prime Ticket, KGIL-1260 and KORG-1190). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell the guys what happened my first year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the 1986-87 season, when the Kings opened the playoffs in Edmonton, 
beating the Oilers, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out the next game," Robitaille said, "and they were all over us all 
night." Final score: Edmonton 13, Kings 3. The Oilers didn't lose again, 
winning the series in five games. 
</P>
<P>
In Calgary, the mood had also shifted. Before Game 1, there was an obsession 
with Gretzky. Would he come? Was he already there? 
</P>
<P>
Flame Coach Terry Crisp talked as if the Great One was involved in the Great 
Scam, that he was hiding somewhere on the slopes of Banff, waiting to drop in 
at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Papers chronicled the Gretzky Watch. One television station reported he had 
been spotted in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky sightings became an overnight rage in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, however, the Flames were more concerned with spotting their own 
deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
As practice ended in Banff, Robinson had a parting observation for a reporter. 
"It is not so much the joy of winning," he said, "but the fear of losing that 
makes you stronger. That's what keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson headed out into the sunshine of Banff. The ice had melted, and the 
roads would be clear for today's trip down to Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
But as Robinson would be the first to add, that didn't mean there might not 
still be danger ahead for the Kings.

TRIATHLON: WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES HOPE TO COMPETE SOMEDAY IN DIFFICULT IRONMAN 
EVENT IN HAWAII. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ironman Triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Even in their wildest dreams, most people would never consider competing in 
this grueling event that taxes the strength and endurance of even the strongest 
of triathletes. 
</P>
<P>
But most people are not confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Dr. John Franks, I'm a chiropractor. I broke my back four years ago," he 
told a spinal rehabilitation support group at Northridge Hospital. Franks, 32, 
was paralyzed from the waist down after a motorcycle accident in November 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt my legs just go out," Franks said in a subsequent interview. "They 
turned off just like a TV set. You know an old TV set, how you turn it off and 
the screen just kind of dims out? That's how my legs felt. There was just a 
massive tingling that got less and less and less." 
</P>
<P>
Spinal injuries are not uncommon, but Franks' reaction to his was. He began to 
compete against able-bodied athletes in triathlons, even though he had no 
experience in the sport. "I was lying in bed, and everybody kept coming in; 
(they) went and searched out some miracle to come in and talk to me, to give me 
hope," Franks said. "I wasn't the one that needed it -- everyone else didn't 
have any hope. I was unaccepting of the injury. I still am." 
</P>
<P>
The triathlon is generally considered to be the ultimate test of fitness. The 
Ironman, which consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle race and a 
26.2-mile run in Hawaii, is the ultimate triathlon, and Franks envisioned 
himself competing in it. 
</P>
<P>
"My thoughts were, 'I'm going to get in the best shape that I've ever been in 
and do something that's totally ludicrous for the shape that I've always been 
in,' " Franks said. "I certainly wasn't thinking of doing it out of the chair, 
but the chair didn't go away. It still hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a matter of simply getting in shape. Disabled athletes must have 
special wheelchairs made, and Franks has two, one for the run portion of the 
race and one for cycling. A lack of sponsorship has made it difficult for him 
to devote as much time as he would like to competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lightweight braces to lock his legs straight and a custom body suit to fit over 
the braces were necessary to swim, but they didn't solve his greatest problem. 
While training in Maui shortly after the accident, Franks discovered that he 
could no longer swim freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to swim, and I got 15 or 20 feet and I almost drowned," he said. "If 
you were watching me, it would have looked like a bird with broken wings trying 
to fly. It looked that bad. It felt that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Franks, who switched to the backstroke and was so successful that he 
consistently beats a large percentage of the field in swimming, uses this 
example to illustrate the determination of Bobby Rohan, whom he met at 
Northridge Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Rohan's room is like any other teen-ager's. Posters of his heroes, such 
as Greg LeMond in his Tour de France victory-clinching ride down the Champs 
Elysees, fight for space with a stereo system. But Bobby Rohan is not a typical 
teen-ager. He is a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
While on a training ride in March 1989, Rohan, 18, rode into the back of a 
parked bus in a bike lane near his West Hills home. Several days later, doctors 
told him that he would never walk again. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I thought was, 'Boy, I get to miss tomorrow out of school,' " 
Rohan said. "I thought, 'That can't be true,' and that's the way I felt for 
about a couple of weeks. When I just started getting up and getting around 
every day, I kind of settled in and thought, 'Well, I've got to change my life 
now. Here it goes, give it all you've got to your new life.' 
</P>
<P>
"I still planned for triathlons. I said, 'I'll start training in the summer 
lightly, and I'll do my first triathlon next year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rohan became interested in triathlons in the fall of 1987 after he saw a friend 
compete in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'I can do that. I can swim, anyone can ride a bike and anyone can 
run.' We got home, and I started training for a triathlon," Rohan said. 
</P>
<P>
In an average week before his accident, Rohan, who competed in almost 40 
triathlons and was a consistent high finisher in his age group, swam nearly 10 
miles, cycled between 200 and 300 miles, ran from 25 to 50 miles and also 
competed on his high school swimming and cross-country teams. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rohan is dealing with enormous changes in his life, which are difficult 
for an able-bodied person to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of training for triathlons, Rohan must practice the little things that 
came naturally before the accident. Because he has no coordinated hand or 
finger movement, he has had to relearn how to eat, drink, write, brush his 
teeth and even scratch his nose. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting up in the morning (was the hardest adjustment)," Rohan said. "(When 
you're able-bodied), you get up and take a shower and get dressed and comb your 
hair and eat breakfast in less than a half an hour, if you want to, before 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it takes an hour and a half to two hours to get everything done." 
</P>
<P>
The accident also was difficult for his father. 
</P>
<P>
"You just take it for granted that the kids are going to get up and take care 
of themselves," Jim Rohan said. "You get angry. I get mad at Bobby for whatever 
reason, but I think it's more mad at myself. 
</P>
<P>
"You sit there and see a kid who had everything going for him, and then there's 
a stupid accident? Why? 
</P>
<P>
"You don't expect things like this." 
</P>
<P>
Anger accompanies disabling injuries, as both Franks and Rohan discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how positive you are, how tough you are or what, you spend a 
couple months in the hospital . . . and have people treating you like a piece 
of meat on a slab, it'll get to you eventually," Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rohan: "The jealousy part is the worst, because you look at everyone and 
everything, and you get jealous pretty easily about everything. My friends will 
go out to a place that I can't go to, or my brother will go out a lot and I 
can't go because there's not enough room with my chair and me. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets frustrating sometimes when you're in a hurry and you're trying to get 
your shirt on and your arms get stuck, and you fall over and you have to ask 
someone for help. You just can't walk up and get something out of the 
refrigerator or out of the cupboard to eat or snack on. If no one's around, you 
just have to wait for someone to do that for you." 
</P>
<P>
The anger can also be productive. Sandra Rudnick, a clinical psychologist who 
leads the spinal injury support group at Northridge Hospital, said the 
pre-accident mentality normally associated with athletes -- determination, 
endurance, an achievement-motivated outlook -- can be a major factor in their 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Rohan spends eight hours a day in occupational therapy, where he is learning 
how to function independently and finding an outlet for his competitive nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be at (therapy) and we'll be doing a bicycle machine for our arms and 
I'll go all out," Rohan said. "I'll find myself pushing myself just like I was 
on the bike. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll see people do (a hand movement), and I can't do it yet. That day on the 
mat, I'll work on it, (saying,) 'I've got to get it, I've got to get it.' I 
don't care how long it takes me." 
</P>
<P>
Franks also attributes his determination to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby's an athlete, I'm an athlete. We're both aggressive people. Aggressive 
people fight. Less aggressive people are more accepting," Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
When Franks speaks of his injury, it is as a temporary thing. He keeps track of 
the latest scientific developments in spinal research and gives serious 
attention to all of them, from cellular regeneration to ideas from the movie, 
"RoboCop." 
</P>
<P>
"The key is interfacing human tissue with robotics," Franks said. "If they did 
an interface tomorrow, I'd let them amputate my legs." 
</P>
<P>
Franks' views may not be as far-fetched as they appear, as a recent 
conversation with a friend from chiropractic school illustrates. 
</P>
<P>
"She said that she was at a seminar recently where a doctor said that in the 
next 10 to 15 years there won't be anyone in wheelchairs anymore," Franks said. 
"She called me and she was all excited. She said, 'He's saying what you've been 
saying, they've gotten some new stuff.' And I said, 'I know. There's no 
revelation to what he's saying, he's just getting on the bandwagon.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rohan, who was recently hospitalized again because of a calcium buildup, has a 
similar, although less radical, outlook -- one that he occasionally visualizes 
at night before falling asleep. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, I'll just lie there before I fall asleep, and I'll do the swim 
part," Rohan said. "Then I'll do a bike and then a run and then I'll cross the 
finish line. I never stop thinking about that. I'll probably never stop 
visualizing it until it happens again." 
</P>
<P>
Rohan, who is as determined as Franks to do the Ironman, saw Franks again at 
the 1989 Ironman Triathlon, where were spectators. Franks made his cycling 
wheelchair available to Rohan, who rode for about a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
"Words can't describe it," Rohan said. "It was so neat that I even got a chance 
to be back on a bike. Because of that, now I know that some day I'll be back 
there competing again. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I'm going to be out there pretty soon racing him. (Franks) said it 
himself, he can't wait until I'm out there racing. I know I'll be out there 
racing again, with him or side by side."

RACE TRACKS SOFT-SELL THEIR MOST LUCRATIVE ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BALTIMORE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the traditional standards of the racing business, this will be an ordinary 
day at Pimlico. There are no stakes races or notable horses on the 10-race 
card; there are no special promotions, no tote-bag giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the atmosphere at Pimlico, and at the Laurel simulcast, will be crackling 
with excitement, because of a $228,814 jackpot that has amassed in the 
double-triple. A bettor who correctly picks the one-two-three finishers in both 
the third and fifth races could win more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing that will generate fan interest, publicity and wagering 
activity more than such an opportunity to win a spectacular sum of money. 
Laurel demonstrated this in memorable fashion in late 1988, when its 
double-triple carryover grew into seven digits. 
</P>
<P>
"That was by far the most profitable week any track in Maryland has ever had," 
said Jim Mango, the track's vice president for operations. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the racing industry has devoted almost no effort to developing and 
promoting exotic wagers. Some tracks' managements (Santa Anita's, for example) 
act as if there is something vaguely distasteful about the wagering part of 
their business. And most are utterly oblivious to the fact that exotic wagers 
are potentially their most important product. 
</P>
<P>
Consider for example a couple of events at Gulfstream Park this winter. The 
track paid Bill Shoemaker to make a stop on his farewell tour, and promoted the 
event relentlessly in the local media. This great expenditure of effort and 
money may have added a paltry few thousand dollars to a normal Saturday handle 
at Gulfstream, yet this was the kind of traditional promotion that track 
marketing people love. 
</P>
<P>
On the Sunday of the next week, Gulfstream's pick six had built into six 
figures. If nobody hit it, track officials thought a carryover would boost 
their handle the next racing day by as much as $600,000. Yet on that crucial 
Sunday, the racing secretary foolishly carded a pair of small fields with 
overwhelming favorites as part of the pick six -- enabling several bettors to 
hit it and killing the carryover jackpot. (Elsewhere on the card, there were 
three open 12-horse fields that probably would have foiled bettors if they had 
been part of the pick six.) 
</P>
<P>
If anyone in Gulfstream's management had chosen to think even briefly about the 
pick six and its importance, the track would have had its carryover and its 
resultant bonanza the next day. But nobody did. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that racetrack-marketing departments are in the habit of 
promoting giveaways and special events like the Shoemaker tour, but they don't 
market gambling. Few track managements have even tried intelligently to answer 
the basic question: What makes a good exotic wager? 
</P>
<P>
Tom Aronson, a Washington-based consultant to racetracks, has analyzed the 
subject, and he said, "Bettors have a very keen ability to decide when they're 
not being paid enough for predicting an improbable event. Some tracks tried 
offering a pick six without a carryover and people wouldn't bet it; they said, 
'If I'm going to pick six winners, I've got to get back more than $3,000.' But 
to attract racegoers to a bet, it has to be within their field of logic. If you 
ask them to pick six winners in a row, that's plausible; if you ask them to 
pick nine in a row, it's not." 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, California's pick nine, Hialeah's pick ten, and various 
tracks' trifecta-superfecta combinations generally have not been popular. The 
pick six and the double-triple are the only exotics that have had widespread 
success. Fans think it is conceivable to hit them, and they like that there is 
a reasonable consolation payoff for a near-miss. But no significant new forms 
of exotic wagering have been introduced in years. 
</P>
<P>
"State lotteries understand that every game has its limits and they have to 
keep introducing new things to keep people's interest," Aronson said. "But 
there is a limited understanding in horse racing of product development." 
</P>
<P>
Where can exotic wagering go from here? Aronson likes the idea of guaranteeing 
the minimum size of the betting pool to make it build faster. People don't bet 
much in the double-triple when there is no carryover because there isn't enough 
economic incentive. But if Laurel guaranteed a pot of $50,000, they would bet 
from the outset and the pot would grow faster. 
</P>
<P>
Mango thinks a better variation on the current theme would be to change the 
size of the wagering unit. He said, "The common thing I hear is, 'Make the 
double-triple a $1 bet.' But you'd never build up a big carryover, and you'd 
allow the big syndicates to play three times as many combinations (thus giving 
them an even better chance of tying up all the logical combinations). I'd like 
to experiment with the size of the base wager. Suppose you guaranteed the 
double-triple for $250,000 and made the base wager $5 or $10?" 
</P>
<P>
One dog track in Florida has devised a successful variation on the basic 
exotic-wagering theme with a $1 wager. The object in Hollywood Greyhound 
Track's tri-super was to pick the first three finishers in one race and the 
first four finishers in the next. But when the carryover reached $100,000 it 
was "capped" -- no further money was added to the jackpot pool. 
</P>
<P>
This might not seem to make sense from the track's standpoint, but Hollywood 
had found that when a jackpot grew much higher, syndicates would make such 
large investments that they would almost always hit the bet. But these 
syndicates weren't going to invest, say, $30,000 in the tri-super to win 
$100,000. The effect of the "cap" was to keep the tri-super jackpot alive, 
night after night. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities are endless, if only more racetrack managements would start 
thinking about them and engaging in "product development." One day somebody is 
going to conceive of an exotic bet that will generate the excitement of 
Pimlico's $228,814 double-triple carryover on an almost daily basis.

GOLF LPGA AT POWAY; 
</P>
<P>
RITTENHOUSE GETS ANOTHER ROLLING START, LEADS BY 1 WITH A 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She birdied four of her last eight holes and shot a five-under-par 66, but by 
the time Lenore Rittenhouse stepped out of her golf shoes and into her thongs 
Thursday at StoneRidge in Poway, there was one thing on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go home, play with my dog and try to trick my mind into thinking 
tomorrow is the start of a new tournament," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenhouse was alone in first place after the opening day of the LPGA Red 
Robin Kyocera Inamori tournament, played in chilly winds and under an overcast 
sky. By the time the scoresheets were filled, Rittenhouse had a one-stroke lead 
over Nancy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown stepped off the course with thoughts similar to Rittenhouse's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going, 'Oh my God, here I go again,' " Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were ahead of Michelle McGann, the youngest player on the tour at 20, 
and Laurie Rinker, who were tied for third at 68. Seven players were tied at 
69. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenhouse and Brown both were a little haunted, and with good reason. They 
are playing against history -- let alone the rest of the field -- this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenhouse had a start similar to last week's at the Nabisco Dinah Shore 
tournament in Rancho Mirage. She led after the first round with a five-under 67 
-- two strokes ahead of Betsy King. She went out the second day and bogeyed her 
way to a 78, and followed that with a 74 and 77. By the time King was accepting 
the winner's check, Rittenhouse had plummeted into a tie for 40th. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the first time Rittenhouse disappeared from the leader board after 
the first day. And if she goes out today and disappears again, it won't even be 
the first time she has done it at StoneRidge. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, she shot a career-low 65 in the first round here. She went on to 
score 71, 72 and 77 in succeeding rounds and tied for 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
She nearly shot a 65 Thursday but missed a six-foot putt on No. 9, which was 
her final hole since she started on No. 10. The ball rimmed the cup and stayed 
out, and Rittenhouse bent over in frustration. Then she signed her card and 
headed for the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a first-day player," she said to nobody in particular. 
</P>
<P>
If this was track, Rittenhouse would be known as the rabbit. If it was 
Indianapolis, Rittenhouse would be driving the pace car. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in my career I have led a lot of tourneys after the first day but 
screwed up the next," she said. "It's not a choke to me, it's like trying too 
hard. Choke is when you can't bring yourself to do it. When I play bad, it's 
like the whole round is mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
As for her missed putt, Rittenhouse said it was strategy that went awry. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted that bad," she said. "I played it straight and it broke. I saw 
another player play it and it didn't break. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I play a one-day tournament?" 
</P>
<P>
Rittenhouse, who won her only LPGA tournament championship in the 1983 United 
Virginia Bank tournament, was two under par after her first nine holes but 
bogeyed No. 1. Then she birdied the second, third, fifth and sixth holes. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 28, has never won an LPGA tournament but is coming off a very consistent 
year. She finished 16 times in the top 20 in 1989, with five top-10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Had she played well on the final day at StoneRidge last year, she may have had 
six top 10 finishes. She was tied for the lead after two rounds with a 
six-under-par 136. She led by herself after the third round by two strokes over 
eventual winner Patti Rizzo with a seven-under-par 206. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she went out on the final day and shot a 78 and fell into a tie for 17th. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little tight," she said. "I just tried to get birdies, and I got a 
questionable ruling on the 10th hole, just when I felt like I was starting to 
get my composure." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, Brown thought she should have gotten a drop from a bad lie, 
and officials wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
Her first round Thursday temporarily put that out of her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to play well," she said. "I haven't had a lot of good first rounds 
this year. It's nice to get some birdies early." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had three birdies in her first nine, two on the second. She shot par or 
under on 17 holes. She had a bogey on the par-five sixth hole. 
</P>
<P>
She remains wary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to try to go out and play like I did," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
LPGA Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Ramsbottom had a hole in one with a four-iron on No. 7 (166 yards), but 
finished at 77. . . . Betsy King, winner of last week's Nabisco Dinah Shore 
tournament, was one of seven players at two-under. . . . Patti Rizzo, the 
tournament's defending champion, shot a 72. Patty Sheehan, a three-time winner, 
also shot a 72. . . . Ayako Okamoto, two-time tournament winner, had a 71. . . 
. Sally Little withdrew to undergo knee surgery.

<P>
Jennifer Capriati continued to impress crowds and her opponents Thursday, 
beating French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez to advance to the quarterfinals of 
the Family Circle Magazine Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in her third tournament since turning professional last month, 
Capriati, 14, took only 45 minutes to defeat Sanchez, seeded second and rated 
fifth in the world, 6-1, 6-1 on the green clay at Sea Pines Racquet Club on 
Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, who is not seeded and has not played in enough pro events to be 
ranked, is 11-2 as a professional and 3-1 against top-10 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
She was both precise and powerful in beating Sanchez, rated fifth in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was one of the best matches that I've played so far," Capriati 
said. "I mean it wasn't so easy. I had to keep playing well. I think I just 
didn't give her a chance to come back into the match because I was playing 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati lost only four points on her serve in each set. She had 12 unforced 
errors to 18 for Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Brad Gilbert advanced to the quarterfinals of the Prudential-Bache 
Securities tournament in Orlando, Fla., and No. 2 Aaron Krickstein withdrew 
after suffering a torn right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, one of three seeded players remaining in the quarterfinals, beat Jimmy 
Brown, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I was striking the ball a lot better tonight," said Gilbert, who will meet 
Joey Rive, a 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 winner over Miguel Nido of Puerto Rico, in today's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein's injury put Alex Hombrecher, a Stanford University freshman ranked 
on the lowest rung of the computer at No. 1,095, into his first professional 
quarterfinal. He will go against David Pate.

DEFENSE PUTS PISTONS BACK ON WINNING TRACK, 104-99

<P>
Having lost four consecutive road games, the Detroit Pistons sought a return to 
their winning ways by concentrating on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Piston Coach Chuck Daly told his players if they held the Atlanta Hawks under 
100 points Thursday night, Detroit almost could be assured of getting back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Aguirre came off the bench to score 25 points and Isiah Thomas hit four 
free throws in the final 31 seconds as the Pistons defeated the Hawks, 104-99, 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows the Pistons play tough," Aguirre said. "We played tough 
defensively down the stretch and we made some big shots." 
</P>
<P>
Spud Webb brought the Hawks to within 100-98 with a three-point shot with 12 
seconds left, but Bill Laimbeer made two free throws one second later to help 
secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnie Johnson, starting in place of the injured Joe Dumars, played 43 minutes 
and scored 20 points for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 111, Orlando 104 -- Michael Jordan scored 16 of his game-high 38 points 
in the fourth quarter at Chicago, and the Bulls won their 50th game of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Smith pulled the Magic to within 104-102 on a 17-foot jump shot with 1:27 
left, but a basket by Jordan and free throw by Horace Grant clinched the 
victory for the Bulls, who have won five games in a row and 12 of their last 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored a team-high 21 points for the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 101, Utah 91 -- Dana Barros and Sedale Threatt combined for 36 points 
and led a late 10-0 run to lead the SuperSonics at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
John Stockton of the Jazz scored 23 points and had 12 assists, giving him 1,001 
for the season. He became the first player in NBA history to have 1,000 or more 
assists for three consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone had a game-high 26 points for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Threatt scored 19 points.

Sitting outside Barn 109 at Santa Anita, nursing a cold, Steve Miyadi pointed 
to Barn 118, across the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to sleep over there, in the tack room," Miyadi said. "My wife, Rochelle 
-- we weren't married yet -- slept at the other end. We worked for (trainer) 
John Russell." 
</P>
<P>
The day was ripe for reminiscing. Miyadi, who grew up in nearby Rosemead, 
remembered the first time he saw the Santa Anita Derby. "It was the year (1973) 
that Sham beat Linda's Chief," Miyadi said. "How old could I have been? About 
15, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Miyadi will presumably have a better seat Saturday when the young trainer 
starts Music Prospector, a 10-1 shot on the morning line, in the 53rd running 
of the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the Kentucky Derby on May 5, Music Prospector probably must get 
Miyadi to the winner's circle, and for that to happen, the Irish-raced colt 
must beat seven opponents, including the undefeated Mister Frisky, who is 
seeking his 16th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Longshots like Music Prospector don't win the Santa Anita Derby much anymore, 
and even Miyadi would be surprised by an upset Saturday, although running on 
dirt in America seems to agree with the colt. The last time a real outsider won 
this race was when Mighty Adversary paid $66.20 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The hallmark of this Santa Anita Derby is speed, and Miyadi tried conjuring up 
a scenario that might throw the race to Music Prospector, who probably will be 
running just off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mister Frisky and Real Cash hooked each other (in a speed duel), my horse 
might have a chance," Miyadi said. "But considering the riders involved (Gary 
Stevens on Mister Frisky and Angel Cordero on Real Cash), that's unlikely to 
happen. Two other riders, maybe, but not those two." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Tufts, the Santa Anita linemaker, has made Mister Frisky the even-money 
favorite in the $500,000 race. Eight Santa Anita winners went on to win the 
Kentucky Derby, but after Affirmed in 1978 there was a 10-year gap in this 
progression before Winning Colors and Sunday Silence pulled off the 
California-Kentucky double the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The field in the 1 1/8-mile race lines up this way, with all horses carrying 
122 pounds: Real Cash, with Angel Cordero riding, 2-1; Balla Cove, Russell 
Baze, 20-1; Single Dawn, Alex Solis, 15-1; Music Prospector, Frank Olivares, 
10-1; Video Ranger, Eddie Delahoussaye, 30-1; Assyrian Pirate, Martin Pedroza, 
20-1; Mister Frisky, Gary Stevens, 1-1, and Warcraft, Chris McCarron, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Music Prospector won his first two starts in the United States, taking stakes 
at Bay Meadows and Santa Anita early this year, then he ran third, beaten by 6 
1/4 lengths, in the one-mile San Felipe Handicap on March 18. Real Cash won the 
San Felipe in a wire-to-wire trip, finishing 5 1/2 lengths ahead of Warcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse made a move and then he hung," Miyadi said. "Frank (Olivares) said 
that he had dead aim at the horses in front of him, but he came up empty." 
</P>
<P>
Music Prospector, a grandson of the crack sprinter and powerful sire, Mr. 
Prospector, sprinted four times in Ireland as a 2-year-old, winning just once. 
Just before that victory, Motohide Aoki, a Tokyo breeder and real estate man, 
bought the horse for about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those races over there, he couldn't even beat fillies," Miyadi said. 
"Maybe it was a case of a dirt horse running on grass and not liking it." 
</P>
<P>
Music Prospector was sent to Miyadi just about the time the trainer was 
shifting his stable to Del Mar last summer. Without the work of Curley Ortiz, 
the colt might never have adjusted to American tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign horses usually come over here after they're older, at least 3 and 
maybe 4 or more," Miyadi said. "So here I had this 2-year-old, and he wanted to 
make every gap on the race track down there. He also acted like he wanted to 
breed all the time. We had to break him all over again, and Curley did a nice 
job." 
</P>
<P>
It was at Del Mar that Miyadi scored the biggest victory of his four-year 
career as a head trainer, winning last year's Del Mar Futurity with Drag Race. 
That colt's future is on grass. 
</P>
<P>
Before Miyadi's mother died of cancer, she made her two sons and one daughter 
promise that they'd prepare for their futures by going to college. Steve 
Miyadi, who had been going to the races with his father since he was 10, earned 
a degree in accounting at UC Santa Barbara, but a career at the track was 
always on the front burner. He chose his major only because those courses came 
easy for him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Russell, Miyadi also worked under trainers Richard Cross and Mike 
Mitchell. Miyadi's wife, Rochelle, works for her husband, ponying horses and 
helping at the barn. Their 3-year-old son, C.J., was all over the place the 
other day, seeing what his parents were up to. 
</P>
<P>
Since Miyadi left college, satellite betting has come to the Southland, and one 
of the locations is in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing they didn't have that when I was there," Miyadi said. "Can 
you imagine? They would have never seen me at class." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The other half of the racing doubleheader on ABC-TV Saturday is as bland as the 
Santa Anita Derby is intriguing. At Gulfstream Park, 12 second-rate 3-year-olds 
will run in what is almost guaranteed to be the least important of the Kentucky 
Derby preps. Run Turn, third in the Florida Derby, may go off the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-horse field is entered in the Gotham at Aqueduct, with Rhythm, last 
year's champion 2-year-old colt, making his first start since undergoing throat 
surgery last month. Others in the race are Burnt Hills, Senor Pete and the 
Wayne Lukas-trained pair of Kentucky Jazz and Richard R. Laffit Pincay, with no 
mount in the Santa Anita Derby, a race he has won seven times, will ride 
Richard R. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas, who also trains Real Cash, plans to run Land Rush in the Blue Grass 
Stakes at Keeneland a week from Saturday and will send Hail Atlantis, the 
filly, to the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Santa Anita Derby starters are eligible for the Triple Crown races. 
. . . Steinlen, last year's male turf champion, will make his second try for 
his first victory this year when he runs Sunday in the El Rincon Handicap. 
Steinlen won the stake in 1988 and was second in it last year.

VIRGINIA FIRM USES A B-52 TO LAUNCH SATELLITES; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE LAUNCH IS CONSIDERED A BREAKTHROUGH FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, 
WHICH HOPES TO TAP THE LUCRATIVE ROCKET BUSINESS. 
</P>

<P>
A pair of military satellites were successfully launched into orbit Thursday by 
an innovative unmanned rocket that was launched after being dropped from a B-52 
flying 43,000 feet over the Pacific some 62 miles west of Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a payload had been launched into space orbit from a 
plane, and the flight marked a stunning success for Orbital Sciences Corp., a 
small Fairfax, Va., company that was hired by the Pentagon to hoist the 
satellites into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Edward Nicastri, who was in charge of the flight for the government 
and viewed the flight from Edwards Air Force Base, called it "a total success." 
</P>
<P>
Orbital Sciences is one of a handful of entrepreneurial companies trying to 
make a go of it in the small commercial rocket launch business. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lot riding on Orbital Sciences' first flight, named Pegasus after 
the winged horse of Greek mythology. Two of the three previous launch attempts 
in the past 14 months by two other small American firms had ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
Orbital Sciences and its partner, Hercules Aerospace, had spent $50 million in 
research and development costs for their first launch. And last month Orbital 
Sciences was forced to postpone a $16-million initial public stock offering 
after a Wall Street Journal story detailed the perils of the small-rocket 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We said we would do it and we did it," said David Thompson, Orbital Sciences' 
co-founder and chief executive after the launch. "This has been a 3-year-long 
crusade for our company." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional vertical rocket launchers that lift off from a launch pad, 
Orbital Sciences saves the expense of using a major rocket booster by having a 
plane carry the rocket into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency paid Orbital Sciences 
$6.5 million for the launch, and NASA provided the B-52. The government has 
already signed up for four other Orbital Sciences launches and is excited about 
the Pegasus program because of the mobile, low-cost rocket launch system that 
could put small intelligence satellites into space quickly during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
The next Pegasus flight, which will carry seven small satellites into orbit, is 
set for some time this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government has also tentatively signed up with Orbital Sciences to 
launch a scientific satellite in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's launch borrowed heavily from the launch concept used in the 
military's X-15 experimental airplane that set many speed and altitude records 
during the 1960s. The X-15 was also carried into the air by a B-52, the same 
plane that carried the Pegasus rocket aloft. 
</P>
<P>
The 41,500-pound, 49-foot Pegasus rocket was attached like a bomb under the 
B-52's right wing, and at 12:10 p.m., the rocket was released over the Pacific. 
Five seconds later, the first of three engine stages ignited, and the rocket 
left behind a white plume of exhaust as it began to climb into space. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Fullerton, a former space shuttle astronaut, piloted the B-52 loaded 
with the Pegasus. He said that when the rocket's first engine ignited, "It was 
really impressive. It looked like a little shuttle launch heading for the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve minutes later the 422-pound payload reached orbit 320 nautical miles 
above the Earth. One NASA satellite attached in the third stage of the rocket 
collected data on the flight and will later release a chemical experiment into 
space. A second Navy communications satellite was also released into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Before the flight, Peter Glaser, a space expert with consulting firm Arthur D. 
Little in Cambridge, Mass., said of Orbital Sciences: "If they have success 
with that design, it will be a real technical advance. They are reaching out to 
a totally novel technology." 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the rocket launch, though, aerospace observers including 
Glaser wondered whether the Pegasus would fly as planned because during the 
first stage of the flight it would be guided by fins at the rear of the craft. 
During the first stage of flight the rocket hit 5,800 miles per hour, a speed 
so fast that no air tunnel could simulate it. 
</P>
<P>
So Orbital Sciences engineers had to rely on computer flight simulations for 
their rocket design. But Thompson said the rocket's successful flight "was not 
the result of luck." 
</P>
<P>
Not everything on the Pegasus was as innovative. The engines, built by 
Hercules, were similar to ones already used in rockets built by Martin Marietta 
and McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The market for small rocket companies developed after the space shuttle 
Challenger accident in 1986 and the government opened the way for private 
commercial rocket launchers. 
</P>
<P>
Three major aerospace companies, Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas and General 
Dynamics -- which have built ballistic missiles for decades -- have lined up 
dozens of commercial customers who want to launch satellites weighing as much 
as 5,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But if the big three rocket companies are like huge moving vans and can charge 
$130 million for a launch, the smaller firms such as Orbital Sciences are more 
like Federal Express, hoping to deliver smaller packages up to 1,000 pounds 
into space at a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday's flight though, the record of the small rocket companies was 
unimpressive. Last year. Space Services, a Houston company run by former 
Mercury astronaut Donald (Deke) Slayton, was the first firm to launch a rocket 
into space on a 15-minute suborbital flight. But a second launched last fall 
was a failure when the rocket's guidance system went askew and the rocket was 
destroyed by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
Another small rival, American Rocket Co. in Camarillo, suffered a humbling 
failure in October when its first launch attempt never got off the ground at 
Vandenberg Air Force Base. The rocket caught fire because of a faulty fuel 
valve, and since then the company has laid off two-thirds of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
When Orbital Sciences completes its military launches, it will have to provide 
its own airplane. Some of its rivals doubt the company will be able to make 
good in its promise to provide orbital launches for between $7 million and $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But that is a problem for another day. For now Orbital Sciences is the only 
small rocket company with a perfect flight record.

S&amp;L BAILOUT COMPROMISE RETURNS TO HAUNT CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When House and Senate conferees met in the steamy days of last summer to write 
a complex bailout bill for the crippled savings and loan industry, they spent 
hours arguing publicly and privately about the job prospects of one man, M. 
Danny Wall. 
</P>
<P>
House members, angered by the escalating cost of the thrift crisis, said Wall 
had misled them about the expense of closing insolvent S&amp;Ls in his role as 
the nation's chief thrift regulator, and they wanted to dump him. 
</P>
<P>
But key senators, including Jake Garn (R-Utah) and Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), 
were avid defenders of Wall, a valued staff member for Garn throughout his 
political career. They insisted that the House drop its demand for a new 
confirmation hearing that would have resulted in a bruising examination of 
Wall's record. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate conferees even made major concessions on the final bailout bill, 
accepting tougher capital standards for imperiled S&amp;Ls in return for Wall's 
job security. 
</P>
<P>
The summertime politics have now come back to haunt Congress. Last month, a 
judge blocked the impending government seizure of an Illinois S&amp;L on the 
grounds that Wall was never confirmed by the Senate as head of the new thrift 
agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. A court of appeals stayed the judge's 
order and will hear the case next week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a cloud hangs over the legality of actions that Wall took before he 
resigned the OTS post in December. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about the power vacuum, the Senate on Wednesday hurriedly approved the 
nomination of T. Timothy Ryan Jr. as the new OTS director. 
</P>
<P>
Memories differ on the importance of Danny Wall's fate in the deliberations 
over the S&amp;L cleanup. The salvage operation will cost taxpayers an 
estimated $285 billion over 30 years as the government dismantles hundreds of 
defunct institutions and pays off their depositors, whose accounts are insured 
up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Garn insisted in a recent interview that he told his staff, "I'm not trading 
anything of substance for Dan Wall." 
</P>
<P>
But according to several key Senate Banking Committee sources, the Senate 
conferees were anxious to avoid reconfirmation proceedings for Wall simply 
because they did not expect Garn to agree to the House-Senate compromise 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
"Garn traded almost everything for not having Danny Wall reconfirmed," said 
Leslie Wooley, an aide to Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.). When the full Senate had 
debated the bailout legislation, Graham offered an unsuccessful amendment to 
require reconfirmation of Wall. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to retain Wall without a new confirmation was first made by the 
Bush Administration in the S&amp;L rescue legislation that it sent to Congress 
early last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I not only didn't insist (on bypassing confirmation), but there was never a 
conversation about it," Garn said. "Dan Wall's name never came up." 
</P>
<P>
Garn's high regard for Wall was well-known, though. Wall, a former city 
planner, had worked for Garn for 17 years, first in Salt Lake City during 
Garn's tenure as mayor and then in Washington after Garn was elected to the 
Senate. Wall served as Garn's top legislative aide and was staff director of 
the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I brought him to Washington with me as my chief legislative 
assistant was because he was incredibly competent and honest," Garn said during 
Senate debate last year. "I have never had any staff member in 21 years in 
public office for whom I had such personal admiration for his integrity and his 
honesty." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said the issue of Wall's fate "was never of great interest to me." But 
he said he felt that it would be necessary to avoid a new confirmation hearing 
for Wall to win approval from Senate Republicans of the final bailout package. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was part of a package that pleased the Republicans -- and 
specifically Garn," Cranston said. "I saw it as part of a package in the 
interest of keeping things together." 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston added that Garn "never said that the price of (Garn) supporting 
this bill is having Wall not confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear to all conferees that the Senate was particularly insistent on 
having Wall continue in office without a new confirmation hearing, according to 
participants in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a failed regulator and a failed regulatory apparatus," said Rep. Jim 
Leach (R-Iowa), author of a House provision to disperse Wall's authority among 
other agencies. The proposal was dropped at the insistence of Senate conferees. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that not only was Wall protected, but his authority was 
enhanced," Leach said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Before the bailout, Wall had been chairman of the three-member Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board. The S&amp;L rescue legislation abolished the board and created 
the Office of Thrift Supervision in the Treasury Department, with Wall as its 
sole administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Leach declined to speculate on the motivations for the Senate's demands to 
avoid a new confirmation hearing for Wall. The "why it happened" is "for others 
to assess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leach instead emphasized the concessions the House extracted during the 
conference. "We were able to get higher capital standards, which had the effect 
of strengthening the bill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he had no objection to holding confirmation hearings on Wall, 
provided that the confirmation process also would apply to L. William Seidman, 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"However, other Senate conferees objected" to letting the House dictate who 
should be subject to Senate confirmation, Cranston said in an interview. "They 
didn't want to yield to the House on an issue that constitutionally is the 
exclusive prerogative of the Senate. Other conferees blew up; I did not blow 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston declined to identify the senators who "blew up." 
</P>

Wall resigned in December, a casualty of the growing political criticism of his 
handling of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, the biggest failure so far 
among the hundreds of collapsed S&amp;Ls. Lincoln's failure will cost taxpayers 
an estimated $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his resignation, Wall said he did not want the Administration's 
rescue plan to be distracted by arguments over his own stewardship as a 
regulator. 
</P>
<P>
Garn, still a staunch defender of his former aide, said Wall was unfairly 
blamed for not foreseeing the magnitude of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the record has been very clear for over three years, from the (General 
Accounting Office), from all the different agencies and different people who 
have testified: Everybody failed -- everybody, without exception," Garn said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them were wrong," he continued. "We all erred dramatically on the side 
of underestimating the problem."

TISCH ORDERS OVERHAUL OF CBS NEWS DIVISION; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SOME SEE THE 'POOLING' OF TECHNICIANS, EXPECTED TO CUT OVERTIME 
COSTS, AS A MOVE TO CENTRALIZE THE NEWS OPERATION. 
</P>

<P>
CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch has ordered a major restructuring of 
CBS News that severely undercuts the authority of CBS News President David 
Burke at a time when Burke has been trying to make up for ground lost during 
years of upheaval at the news division. 
</P>
<P>
The changes ordered by Tisch come when CBS is already reviewing its staffing 
levels and may eliminate about 50 positions, many inside the news division, as 
well as cut back on the use of free-lance producers and crews. 
</P>
<P>
According to CBS sources, Tisch wants to put authority over hundreds of network 
engineers into the hands of a corporate-level executive who could freely assign 
them to the news, sports and entertainment divisions as needed rather than have 
them work exclusively for a particular show or division, as currently is the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move, the reasoning goes, would save the network millions of dollars 
annually by limiting overtime pay for technicians. Cameramen, for instance, can 
and do earn over $100,000 a year because of overtime charges. The 
reorganization is also intended to raise the productivity of engineers and 
technicians by better scheduling their time. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is not being greeted with open arms inside the news division because 
CBS News producers believe that the skills of a news editor or a sports editor 
-- to take one example of the positions affected -- are not necessarily 
transferable. "What the newspeople are concerned about is some mega-event 
breaking and their (cameramen) are all off shooting a soap opera," explained 
one CBS official, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, each program such as "CBS Evening News with Dan 
Rather" or "CBS This Morning," as well as sports broadcasts and daytime soap 
operas, has its own crew of tape editors, audio engineers and control room 
technicians who work solely for those shows or within their respective 
divisions. The new system would create a "pool" of technicians who could be 
dispatched to work on any particular program regardless of its division. 
</P>
<P>
Programs such as "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours" are said to be exempt from the 
plan because of special skills required of people who work on "long form" news 
programs. Also, most of the technicians would continue to be associated with 
specific programs to preserve the current system as much as possible, and job 
cuts are expected to be made primarily through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burke was brought aboard with a mandate to revitalize CBS News and 
shut down damaging leaks to the press, his 30-month tenure nonetheless has been 
plagued by setbacks. The flagship "CBS Evening News" program fell from first to 
third in the ratings and "CBS This Morning" suffered heavy turnover among 
producers and talent while continuing to languish in a distant last place. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch's decision points up the growing frustration of Burke in running CBS 
News. The former No. 2 executive at ABC News, Burke was accustomed to division 
heads being given great latitude in management decisions and not being 
overruled by corporate bosses. This has not been his experience at CBS, where, 
for example, he recently had to reverse himself on "60 Minutes" commentator 
Andy Rooney's suspension after a ratings dip in the program forced Burke to 
reinstate Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
More than simply a new policy on work rules, however, the technicians' pool is 
aimed directly at what Tisch believes to be the unbending ways of CBS News: 
that the division, despite repeated calls to adapt, has ignored changes in the 
marketplace that make its way of doing business outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three networks spends about $250 million annually to gather, 
produce and broadcast news. But a revolution in technology over the past 10 
years has made it possible for viewers to get most of the top stories of the 
day before the evening network news programs come on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Only technicians and engineers at CBS Broadcast Center in New York will be 
affected by the plan. Crews in CBS News domestic and foreign bureaus routinely 
work for a variety of programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some old guard CBS News producers see Tisch's order to further "centralize" the 
news operation as a refusal by him to acknowledge that the process of 
collecting, editing and transmitting news is by nature difficult to plan 
because it cannot take into account events like the upheaval in Eastern Europe, 
which caused CBS News' budget to balloon last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like electing a President because he says he's going to cut waste and 
fraud in Washington," said a CBS News producer who did not want to be named. 
"But Reagan left office with a record deficit, and this is really not any 
different."

said it completed a $22-million acquisition of Santa Barbara-based TMC 
Communications. "The acquisition of TMC solidifies our position as the largest 
regional inter-exchange (long-distance) carrier in the Western United States," 
said Rex Licklider, Com Systems' chairman and chief executive. He said the 
company contemplates additional expansion through acquisition this year.

Non-Alcoholic Beer Sales Grow: Miller Brewing Co. says sales of its new 
non-alcoholic brew, Sharp's, are running twice as high as expected and that it 
has sold out in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Several company distributors across the nation -- including one serving Long 
Beach -- have depleted their inventory, says Miller spokesman Ron Richards, who 
declined to give specific sales figures. Miller has expanded production of 
Sharp's, which was introduced nationally last December, from one to three 
breweries and is considering boosting production capacity even more. Since 
Sharp's contains less than .5% alcohol by volume, the beverage is classified as 
a non-alcoholic brew under government regulations.

KODAK FINED $2.15 MILLION FOR POLLUTING;

<P>
Eastman Kodak Co. was fined $2.15 million in criminal and civil penalties on 
Thursday for violating New York's environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
The photographic giant pleaded guilty in Rochester City Court to two 
misdemeanor violations for illegally disposing of hazardous waste and failing 
to report the spill of a toxic solvent until five days after it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million criminal fine is the largest ever assessed by New York in an 
environmental case and among the largest in the nation, said state Atty. Gen. 
Robert Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents occurred in 1986 and 1987 at the 2,200-acre Kodak Park 
manufacturing center for film and photographic products. The illegal hazardous 
waste disposal was one of a series of violations, said state Assistant Atty. 
Gen. Paul McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea agreement, Kodak was fined $1 million in criminal penalties for 
the two violations, plus $150,000 to be paid to local emergency planning 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak also signed a consent order with the state Department of Environmental 
Conservation. Under that order, the company will pay an additional $1 million 
in civil penalties and begin an extensive cleanup of Kodak Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Herman J. Walz criticized the agreement for letting Kodak's officers 
off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
"When a corporation pleads guilty in exchange for an agreement not to prosecute 
members of the corporation, then people who have participated in a criminal act 
go unpunished," Walz said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this court's view, so-called white-collar criminals ought to be punished as 
severely as any other criminal, and because such criminal conduct frequently 
results in much more serious consequences to society, perhaps more severely." 
</P>
<P>
Kodak spokesman Ronald Roberts said the company had accepted responsibility for 
the violations. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the fines would have little effect on the company's 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
"A fine of a couple million is peanuts to Eastman Kodak," said Michael Ellmann 
of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The settlements are the result of nearly two years' investigation after 
officials discovered in 1988 that chemical leaks and spills had contaminated 
ground water under Kodak Park. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Polito, a former leader of Concerned Neighbors of Kodak Park, said he 
was disappointed with the size of the penalties against Kodak. "It's equivalent 
to you or I getting a jaywalking ticket," he said.

RETAILERS SAY WEATHER WARMED MARCH SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shopping for spring apparel and other seasonal items plus a temporary spell of 
warm weather boosted retail business in March, department store chains reported 
Thursday. And, with a late Easter selling season still ahead, results are 
likely to improve further in April. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of several major general merchandise and department store chains 
said they were satisfied with their results. In a few cases, March sales 
surpassed the weak levels retailers had privately projected. 
</P>
<P>
"On balance, they are slightly better than expected," said Wayne Hood, an 
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "We can look forward to a 
continuing good trend in April," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The overall results were good considering that holiday promotions timed to 
capitalize on the Easter season had not gotten into full swing. Easter falls 
three weeks later this year than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's tallies were measured against a year earlier, when retailers 
benefited from a traditional pickup in shopping ahead of Palm and Easter 
Sundays, a time that brings customers into stores hunting for new outfits. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears that this year shoppers ignored the calendar somewhat and 
started freshening up their warm weather wardrobes early. Mild temperatures in 
parts of the country might have put them in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally we look at March and April together every year because the Easter 
holiday switches and that affects sales," said Gregg Sloate, retail trade 
analyst at Los Angeles-based Seidler Amdec Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Sloate said that, with the help of the brisk apparel business Easter typically 
spurs, he expected stronger sales in April. 
</P>
<P>
Apparel sales outpaced other types of merchandise in March, continuing a 
pattern that has prevailed for more than a year. Sales of hard goods, such as 
expensive household appliances, were softer. 
</P>
<P>
Mediocre economic growth has kept consumers cautious about spending heavily or 
going deeper into debt to finance costly purchases. Car buying, for instance, 
has been very sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stood out from the rest of the pack. The Bentonville, 
Ark.-based discounter posted a 27% March sales spurt.

No wonder the seat cushion company was losing money every month. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sales were growing each month, but we were still short of cash because we 
were underpricing the cushions," said Evans. 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half after his first meeting with Schott, Evans had a detailed 
business plan, a new accountant, cost controls, a toll-free 800 number for 
customers and several major retail clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We have increased sales by five times since we started working with Mr. 
Schott," said Evans, who openly credits Schott for revitalizing his ailing 
company. "When he first got here, we had no internal controls, no cash-flow 
information -- and we didn't know if we were making or losing money." 
</P>
<P>
Schott modestly accepts Evans' praise. 
</P>
<P>
"If people would come to us, we could prevent a lot of failures," said Schott. 
"The talents we have are unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Schott, 75, is one of 13,000 volunteer SCORE counselors providing free advice 
to small-business owners. In 1939, he started Pacific Electricord, a Gardena 
maker of electric cords and cable, in his garage. By the time he sold the 
business in 1972, it had 400 employees and $40 million in sales. "I get a great 
deal of satisfaction out of helping people like Jack," said Schott. 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1964, SCORE has provided counseling and training for 
about 2.5 million small-business owners. In 1989, SCORE counselors met with 
270,000 clients. The SBA supplies office and meeting space for SCORE members, 
management assistance and, this year, a $2.5-million budget for the 
association's activities. There are about 400 chapters and 760 counseling 
locations nationwide. Finding a SCORE counselor is easy: Call your local SBA 
office or SCORE's toll-free number, (800) 368-5855. 
</P>
<P>
Although the help offered is expert and free, only about 20% of the nation's 
small-business owners are aware that SCORE exists, according to a recent SBA 
survey. This year, SCORE is trying to raise its profile by reaching out to 
inexperienced entrepreneurs, women and minorities, according to John Daniels, 
SCORE's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about anyone can make it through the first year or so, but the critical 
time for a small business is the first three years," said Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said many entrepreneurs are reluctant to seek help from the government 
because they are afraid to disclose sensitive financial information to their 
counselors. He said anything a business owner tells his or her SCORE counselor 
remains completely confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Evans said he and his cushion business limped along for about six years 
before his mother, Charlot, got tired of making up the monthly deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 39, has worked as a journalist and school teacher. He admits to being a 
reluctant entrepreneur. He resisted every effort his parents made to interest 
him in taking over their modern furniture store in Los Angeles. "I told my 
father to sell it," said Evans. "I didn't want it." His parents eventually sold 
the business, but his mother found retirement boring and now works full time 
with her son. 
</P>
<P>
Like many inventions, the Comfy-Back seat cushion was born out of necessity. 
Evans was searching for seat cushions to help his father, who has Parkinson's 
disease, feel more comfortable. When he couldn't find a style he liked, he 
designed a cushion himself and had it made. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Evans sold the rounded cushions through the mail. Later, he hired 
sales reps who took the product to medical supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
By the fall of 1988, Mrs. Evans said she was tired of subsidizing the business. 
Reluctantly, Evans called the Santa Monica SBA office and asked them to send 
over a SCORE counselor skilled in manufacturing. Two weeks later, Schott 
arrived, and the rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
SCORE can find help for virtually any kind of small business. 
</P>
<P>
Telitha Bowens, a Detroit illustrator and fine artist, turned to SCORE for help 
after she lost her job on the assembly line at General Motors and was weary of 
being a fashion illustrator for local department stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I'd better start taking control of my life," said Bowens. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she is busy working on projects for several major corporations and 
advertising agencies. She is also an artist with a collection of paintings 
hanging in Detroit's African American History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"My first SCORE counselor, Abe Sacks, was sort of like my guardian angel," said 
Bowens. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks, who has a background in marketing, helped Bowens make contacts with 
advertising agencies and other potential clients. Bowens said she still checks 
in with the SCORE office across the street from her studio on Second Boulevard. 
She's now planning to use the money she earns from her advertising jobs to 
launch a line of greeting cards.

Americans took out $3.4 billion more in consumer credit than they retired in 
February, but the pace slowed because of slackening demand for car loans, the 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 5.7%, down from January's revised 6.4% pace. 
</P>
<P>
The January rate was reported last month to have been 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit, which includes all consumer loans except mortgages, was up 
7.3% in December. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile loans advanced in February to a seasonally adjusted $889 million in 
February. That represented an annual rate of 3.7%, less than half the 8.4% jump 
in January when sales incentives were reinstated. The incentives continued in 
February, but consumer response failed to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
Without incentives, auto loans had fallen 0.4% in December.

ECONOMIC FEARS HOLD DOW TO 1.80 ADVANCE

<P>
Stock prices ended mixed Thursday after rolling back a moderate midday gain as 
concerns about the U.S. economy and first-quarter corporate profits mounted. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had been down 17.34 points 
Wednesday, rose 1.80 to 2,721.17. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 703 up, 744 down and 540 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 144.17 million shares, against Wednesday's 159.54 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors held their positions ahead of March employment figures due this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Traders had feared the Tokyo market would fall sharply overnight after rumors 
swept Wall Street on Wednesday that a Japanese brokerage might be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But the rumors were not substantiated, and the key 225-share Nikkei index eased 
193.88 points to close at 28,249.06. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate fall in Tokyo eased nerves in New York and the Dow managed to gain 
about 13.06 points by mid-session. But in the last hours of trading, the gain 
was pared back as concerns about the economy gained momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said they were nervous about the unemployment data, the first official 
indication of the economy's performance last month. A Reuters poll of 
economists forecast a steady 5.3% unemployment rate and a sharp decline in new 
job growth. 
</P>
<P>
"All eyes are on tomorrow's employment figures," said Trude Latimer of 
Josephthal &amp; Co. "People are hoping the data will support the view that we 
have a slow- or no-growth economy." 
</P>
<P>
The markets have also been dominated by concerns about first-quarter corporate 
profits, which are beginning to stream in slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Among Japanese issues traded on U.S. exchanges, Matsushita Electrical climbed 7 
7/8 to 144 1/2; Kyocera 3 3/4 to 100; Hitachi 7 1/4 to 104 1/4, and Honda Motor 
1 1/4 to 23 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tandem Computers led the active list, down 4 3/4 at 22 1/2. The company said 
revenue for the fiscal quarter that ended last weekend fell short of its 
target. 
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks were also notably weak, faced with what analysts described as the 
prospect of a long and arduous review by government regulators of lending 
practices in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bankamerica dropped 1 1/4 to 26 3/8; First Chicago fell 1 to 29; Citizens &amp; 
Southern Corp. lost 1 1/4 to 25 1/4; Bank of Boston slid 1 1/8 to 12 3/4; 
Manufacturers Hanover dipped 1 1/8 to 30 3/4, and Bank of New York fell 2 1/2 
to 31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares recovered from losses around midday and closed at the day's 
high, helped by early gains on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share index 
closed 7.9 points higher at 2239.5.

Bond Prices Dip in Quiet Session 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slipped in light trading as the market awaited news on March's 
unemployment figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or $1.56 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.51% 
from 8.50% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said there was little news to affect the market. Prices opened lower, 
which traders attributed to profit taking in the wake of a rally Wednesday. 
That rally was spurred by an unconfirmed rumor that a Japanese investment firm 
might be unable to meet a margin call to pay for its stock purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Closes Mixed; Gold Prices Drop 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed in dull trading on world currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell in the United States after rising overseas. On the Commodity 
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $374.80 an 
ounce, down $2.30 from late Wednesday. Republic National Bank of New York 
quoted a late bid for gold of $375 an ounce, down $2.75. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's only significant move came against the Japanese yen. The dollar 
lost one yen against the Japanese currency in Asian trading and fell further as 
trading shifted to Europe and later to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers stressed that trading was quiet overall. Investors remained on the 
sidelines while awaiting the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrial 
nations and today's release of U.S. unemployment figures for March. 
</P>
<P>
Finance officials from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, 
Italy and Canada were planning to meet in Paris to review international 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they had expected the dollar's decline against the yen following 
speculation that monetary authorities might take action to prop up the sagging 
Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 157.90 yen, down 1 yen from Wednesday. Later in 
London, the dollar was quoted lower at 157.74 yen. In New York, the dollar 
closed at 157.50 yen, down from 158.88 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6427 from $1.6416 late Wednesday. In 
New York, one pound cost $1.6420, more expensive than Wednesday's 
$1.6406.COMMODITIES

Petroleum Futures Off; Supply Is Cited 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum futures prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
dropping for the third straight day amid perceptions that gasoline and crude 
oil supplies are outstripping demand. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, soybeans surged while grains were mixed; copper 
futures fell; precious metals retreated; and livestock and meat futures were 
mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 26 to 43 cents lower, with 
the contract for delivery in May at $19.43 a barrel; heating oil was 0.71 cent 
to 1.16 cents lower, with May at 53.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 
1.05 to 1.71 cents lower, with May at 63.29 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was no change in supply-and-demand factors Thursday to 
account for the selloff. But traders have turned increasingly bearish amid 
signs of a rising crude oil production and steady stockpiling of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures surged into the close of trading on the Chicago Board of Trade 
amid expectations for new export sales, while grain futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean exports from Brazil to Europe have been slowed by confusion over 
economic reforms launched last month in the South American country, prompting 
speculation that importers may turn to the United States to meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
In other export developments, analysts said the Soviet Union is rumored to have 
bought as much as 1 million metric tons of corn recently. They said some of 
those purchases may have been reflected in Agriculture Department announcements 
this week of a total of 221,000 metric tons of U.S. corn sold to unknown 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 0.75 cent lower to 0.25 cent higher, with May at $3.70 a 
bushel; corn was 0.50 cent lower to 2 cents higher, with May at $2.7025 a 
bushel; oats were 0.25 cent lower to 0.50 cent higher, with May at $1.5275 a 
bushel.

BUSINESSLAND SAYS IT EXPECTS QUARTERLY LOSS AS SALES SLOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The computer retailer Businessland Inc., hurt by a sharp and unexpected 
slowdown in March sales, warned investors Thursday that it will report a loss 
for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which told analysts in late February that the quarter was right on 
plan, said sales of Apple and IBM computers dropped off markedly after the two 
companies introduced new computers in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland said it expected revenue for the quarter ended March 31 to slip to 
$320 million from $375 million in the prior quarter. Revenue in last year's 
third quarter was $293.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
David Norman, chairman and chief executive, said Businessland would have a 
break-even quarter on an operating basis, meaning the company would post a 
quarterly loss because of about $2 million in interest charges. The company 
will report results April 26. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland's stock closed down $1.50 at $8.875 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to slow March sales, the company was hurt by slim gross profit 
margins overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom, and problems with its 
ComputerCraft chain of stores. Both Businessland U.K. and ComputerCraft lost 
money in the quarter, Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman said the company was taking "strong action" to correct both problems, 
including laying off 15 to 20 people in the United Kingdom and halting 
temporarily expansion plans for ComputerCraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to see improvement in the next quarter in both of those operations," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Operating income also will be affected by adjustments to the company's 
inventory of spare service parts, Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Businessland said it would lay off 195 to 273 people, or 5% to 7% 
of the company's work force. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has suffered from aggressive price discounting of personal 
computers, has had only marginal success in trying to stem the price cutting, 
Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy to put a cap on discounting and thus increase gross margins is 
working, but it is resulting initially in having to walk away from some 
low-margin business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland scored a coup in the third quarter by winning back computer maker 
Compaq Computer Corp., which pulled its popular business computers from 
Businessland shelves last year because of a dispute over pricing. 
</P>
<P>
But Businessland will not begin shipping Compaq computers until later this 
month, and some Businessland salespeople "lost focus" on other products by 
starting to push Compaq machines too soon, Norman said.

HELMSLEY ASKS THE STATE TO DROP TAX EVASION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for Leona Helmsley urged a judge Thursday to dismiss state tax evasion 
charges against the self-styled hotel queen and prove that there is not "one 
law for the wealthy . . . and another for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Dabbing her eyes and nose with a tissue, Helmsley sobbed softly as her 
attorney, Sandor Frankel, said his client had been "ground up in the justice 
machine for nearly five years." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, 70, was convicted of federal tax fraud and sentenced last fall to a 
four-year prison term. The sentence has been stayed pending her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley now faces prosecution for allegedly cheating on her state taxes. She 
is accused of disguising millions of dollars in renovations at her Greenwich, 
Conn., mansion as business expenses incurred by the hotel empire that she and 
her husband Harry run. 
</P>
<P>
Outside state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Helmsley told reporters she was being 
unfairly pursued by prosecutors because of her celebrity status. She said she 
would fight the charges and prove her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough's enough," said Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
She burst into tears again and her team of eight lawyers and a handful of 
bodyguards rushed her toward her gray limousine. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to jail. I've done nothing wrong. My only crime is that I'm 
Leona Helmsley. For that I'm guilty," Helmsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Helmsley, 81, who was ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial in the 
federal case, is expected to undergo a competency examination in April in the 
state case. A hearing was slated for April 30. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Frankel urged Justice John Bradley to dismiss charges against 
Helmsley, saying they were improper because they grew out of immunized 
testimony she gave to a 1985 grand jury investigating sales tax evasion. He 
also said the state charges were based on the same allegations as the federal 
charges and therefore represent double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
He said Helmsley's conviction on federal tax charges, combined with her state 
charges on tax evasion, gives the impression "there is one law for the wealthy, 
well-known and vilified and another for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel said the public has already gotten a clear message that tax evasion is 
wrong from the ordeal of Helmsley's federal trial and her stiff prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public on the outside looking in would say, 'It's not worth it. 
The destruction of human life -- what for?' " Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Atty. Gen. Alfredo Mendez said it would be in the interest of 
justice to prosecute Helmsley to the fullest extent of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about at least $1 million dollars. I just think about the number 
of police officers, teachers and school lunches that New Yorkers go without 
when people don't pay their taxes," said Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would rule on the dismissal motions May 17.

TONIGHT: Knott's Berry Farm's new roller coaster Boomerang opens tonight at 8. 
The ride turns travelers upside down six times -- three forward and three 
backward -- in less than a minute. It replaces the park's old Corkscrew roller 
coaster, credited as the first to turn riders upside down. Ann Conway and Steve

HEAVENLY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN FOR ANGELS FANS

<P>
For a month there was famine. Now, for the feast. 
</P>
<P>
After a wobbly start, Major League Baseball gets under way tonight in Orange 
County after a spring training lockout that sidelined players and made even the 
most hard-core of fans threaten to boycott the favorite American pastime. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight is the first game in the long-awaited Freeway Series as the Dodgers and 
the Angels duke it out for local bragging rights in the traditional, preseason 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Game time is 7:35 p.m. at Anaheim Stadium. Tickets at the stadium cost between 
$3 and $9 and there are thousands of seats left, Angels team officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium caterers will be serving up sushi, pasta and low-fat yogurt for 
baseball fans who have burned out on the traditional hot dog and soda. Rowdy 
KLOS radio disc jockeys Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps will throw out the first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Angels-Dodger contest itself is off to a blander-than-usual 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
When the lockout ended, the game in Anaheim was scheduled for Sunday, then 
moved to tonight. The false start seems to have dampened enthusiasm for the 
Freeway Series with Angels officials predicting a modest turnout of 43,000 for 
tonight's opener. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Dodgers we usually have upwards of 60,000," said Angels spokesman Tom 
Seeberg. "But I think the uncertainty and the last-minute change from Sunday to 
Friday has probably hurt attendance." 
</P>
<P>
Still, fans lined up at Anaheim Stadium Thursday afternoon for tickets to the 
cross-town rivalry. The Angels recently broke a team record, surpassing the 
18,500 mark for season tickets, Seeberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a bet on the Freeway Series," said Mike Megia, an Irvine ticket agent 
and die-hard Dodgers fan who plans to attend tonight's game. "Nothing serious, 
just lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Freeway Series does not count in the season standings, some fans 
are still taking it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to go down there and see what these guys look like so I can have 
an idea of what's going to happen the rest of the season," said Angels Booster 
Club President Rich Kanger. "There's always a certain anxiousness about seeing 
the baseball season start." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement was infectious at Anaheim Stadium, where bustling 
concessionaires prepared food and grounds-keepers painted fences and trimmed 
grass during furious, last-minute game preparations. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been running all over the building," said a winded John Trosper, 
stadium concessions manager. "The ice machines and Coke systems have been 
dormant for about six weeks so now we're in the process of turning everything 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three days before the official season opener, baseball mania is 
flourishing in Orange County. Memorabilia shops that couldn't give away 
baseball cards during the lockout now can't keep enough items with the Angels 
logo on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like night and day now compared to before the strike was settled," said 
Bob Saucedo, an Orange sports store owner whose business suffered during the 
lockout. "I'm sold out of Angels trash cans and if I don't have one when they 
(fans) come in, they get really upset." 
</P>
<P>
Says Bob Jablonski, a Santa Ana store owner: "Fans show their allegiance by 
buying caps, T-shirts, even jackets, which is amazing considering how thick 
they are and how hot it is in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local ticket agencies have been fielding hundreds of calls each day 
from fans who want a prime piece of the action. Prices for premium seats for 
regular season games have doubled over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We cater to people who want to see the game without having to bring 
binoculars. They like mustard on their hot dogs instead of bloody noses," said 
Kevin Miles, an Irvine broker whose corporate clients plunk down $75 to $150 to 
impress out-of-town clients with choice seats in field boxes. "They want the 
good stuff between bases and don't want to take a prized client and stick them 
up in the boonies." 
</P>
<P>
In an ironic twist due to rescheduling after the lockout, the Angels and the 
Dodgers will both open at home on the same day for the first time ever, 
splitting the loyal following of two teams just a freeway jaunt apart -- 
especially among Orange County transplants who still root for Dodger Blue. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' regular season opener, against the Seattle Mariners, will begin at 
6:05 p.m. Monday -- just 4 1/2 hours after the first pitch is thrown in Los 
Angeles, where the Dodgers play the San Diego Padres at 1:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans, such as Jim Simpson, 33, of Huntington Beach, have found an easy 
solution to their dilemma. "I'm going to make opening day of the Dodgers then 
swing by, pick up my son and go over to Anaheim Stadium," he said. "I'm either 
going to miss the end of one or the beginning of the other. But I grew up in 
Pasadena following the Dodgers and I still haven't let them go -- kind of like 
a kid with an old teddy bear or a blanket." 
</P>
<P>
Others are still undecided. "I'll probably go to the Angels game with my radio 
and play the Dodgers game, or, go to the Dodgers game with my radio and listen 
to the Angels so I won't miss anything," said Lorraine Saunders of San 
Clemente.

PARENTS' TIPS LED TO CAPTURE OF TWO FUGITIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The distraught parents of escaped Orange County murderer Jeanette Lynn Hughes 
and her alleged prison-guard accomplice placed calls to California prison 
officials that led to their capture after 10 days on the run, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' father, James C. Tugwell of San Bernardino, notified authorities last 
Saturday that his daughter had called an aunt, asking for money and indicating 
that she was somewhere in west Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Sandra Coglietti, mother of fugitive prison guard Cindy Marie 
Coglietti, told police that Cindy had called a sister asking that money be 
brought the following night to El Paso International Airport, said Detective 
Keith Henricksen of the San Bernardino County Sherriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief interview Thursday at her home in San Bernardino County, Sandra 
Coglietti said, "As a mother, I am hurting very bad." She declined to elaborate 
further on the circumstances surrounding her daughter's capture. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents, alerted that the fugitives were in west Texas, swooped down on the 
El Paso airport Tuesday night and, together with local police, arrested the two 
women as they apparently waited for the money to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 36, of Huntington Beach, was detained on federal charges of escaping 
from the California Institute for Women at Frontera on March 25. She was 
serving 26 years to life for the murder of her husband. Coglietti, 26, a guard 
in the same housing unit as Hughes, was arrested on federal charges of aiding 
and abetting Hughes' escape. 
</P>
<P>
Both women remain in the El Paso County Detention Facility pending a 
preliminary hearing scheduled Monday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Coglietti had asked for money from her sister so that she and Hughes could fly 
to Denver, Henricksen said. The women disclosed in federal court Wednesday that 
they were down to their last $3. 
</P>
<P>
Henricksen said the pair apparently decided to go to Colorado after Hughes' 
aunt in Shreveport, La., turned down her request for money. 
</P>
<P>
The aunt, Frances Albritton, 69, said that she and her husband, Earl, told 
Hughes' father about the call and that he in turn notified officials at the 
state prison from which Hughes escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted her back in custody. We all did," Albritton said Thursday in a 
telephone interview. "Because she was running, she had no money. She had 
nothing but the clothes on her back. And I know that if she got desperate 
enough, something bad would happen." 
</P>
<P>
According to a criminal complaint filed in El Paso U.S. District Court, state 
and federal authorities searching for the fugitives hadn't a clue as to their 
whereabouts until Tugwell's call. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the fugitives' families) hadn't worked with us, we would have had a real 
tough time finding them," said Ross Dykes, associate warden of the California 
Institute for Women. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the parents were convinced of the fact that it would not help for them 
to run," Henricksen said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of their disappearance, authorities knew only that Hughes had 
escaped and that Coglietti had disappeared the same day. Coglietti's relatives 
filed a missing-persons report when she failed to show up for her next 
scheduled shift on March 29, Henricksen said. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of March 30, Albritton said, she received a call from Hughes, 
a niece she had not seen or spoken with in 10 years. Albritton said she asked 
Hughes if she had "some good news for me," hoping that Hughes had been paroled. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'No, I'm afraid not.' She said, 'I walked out . . . because my life 
was in danger,' " Albritton said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes declined to elaborate on the danger, nor would she disclose exactly 
where she was calling from, Albritton said. She would only say that she was 
"somewhere in west Texas" and that she was traveling with a friend, whom she 
described only as "a guard," Albritton said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'I need some help . . . could you and Uncle Brit possibly let me 
have some money?' " Albritton said. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to break the law by helping her out, Albritton said, she asked 
Hughes to call back in two hours, when her husband was scheduled to return. The 
fugitives refused to wait. Albritton then telephoned Tugwell, who notified the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Tugwell declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were able to pinpoint the fugitives' location in west Texas after 
Coglietti telephoned a sister living in Southern California on Monday, 
Henricksen said. 
</P>
<P>
The sister, whom Henricksen knew only as Dawn, was asked by Coglietti if her 
husband could fly to El Paso and give them money for plane tickets to Denver, 
Henricksen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know that they had a plan to go to Denver -- that caught us by 
surprise," Dykes said. "Their route, maybe it made sense to them, but to go 
from Phoenix to Las Vegas to El Paso and then to Denver, it was almost just 
kind of silly, really. But they may have had an elaborate plan that we didn't 
know about." 
</P>
<P>
The sister told her mother about the call, and the mother called California 
prison authorities, Henricksen said. Hughes and Coglietti apparently went to 
the El Paso airport to await the husband's arrival, Henricksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hughes gave a false name to arresting police, Coglietti admitted under 
FBI interrogation that she had assisted in Hughes' escape, according to police 
and federal court records. 
</P>
<P>
In El Paso U.S. District Court on Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Janet C. Ruesch 
ordered that Hughes be held without bond and that Coglietti be held in lieu of 
$40,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Warden Dykes said that in addition to the federal charges, Coglietti 
will be charged with violating section 4533 of the California Penal Code, which 
concerns a "keeper permitting a prisoner to escape." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes also said prison officials were attempting to sort out complex state 
procedures in an effort to "separate (Coglietti) from state service." Coglietti 
has been classified as absent without official leave but will remain on the 
state payroll pending an administrative proceeding before the State Personnel 
Board, Dykes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we could prohibit her from getting her (paycheck)," he said. "If 
she had earned income, we'd probably have to release it to her." 
</P>
<P>
Henricksen said Coglietti had been attempting to work out a deal under which 
she would cooperate with police in exchange for facing only the federal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was convicted of first-degree murder in the Jan. 10, 1984, death of her 
husband, James. In what was determined to be a collaborative plot to collect 
$442,000 in life insurance, Hughes' lover, Adam Salas Ramirez, killed the 
victim with two shots to the head while Hughes slept beside him. Ramirez is 
serving a 28-years-to-life sentence for first-degree murder.

THREE ELUDE POLICE IN VACANT STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police SWAT team used smoke bombs, a police helicopter and a 12-man team to 
search unsuccessfully Thursday for three armed men seen entering a vacant 
hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 p.m. call came from an employee of an Oshman's Sporting Goods next to the 
vacant Handyman hardware store at 8181 La Palma Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The employee, John Hemminger, said he saw the three men "walking over to the 
door and then they hopped right in." He said the men removed plywood that had 
been placed over a glass door on the building. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police sent a 12-man hostage rescue team, which used smoke bombs and 
a public address system before entering the building. The building was declared 
safe about 4 p.m. No one was injured, but the Oshman's store was evacuated for 
about two hours during the incident, police said.

PROPOSED SITES FOR AIRPORT DRAW FLAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY and JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The designation of Camp Pendleton in San Diego County and Cristianitos Canyon 
in South County as preferred sites for a new airport has drawn immediate fire 
from those with a stake in the properties. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County civilian and military leaders lined up solidly in opposition 
to efforts to build a $6.5-billion regional airport for Orange County in 
southwestern Camp Pendleton adjacent to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
And developer Anthony R. Moiso, president of the Santa Margarita Co., which 
owns the Cristianitos Canyon site, said he will continue to oppose selection of 
that site as the location for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon "has been owned by members of my family for over 100 years and 
recently, a wilderness reserve area was established directly adjacent to the 
canyon," Moiso said earlier this week. "It is inconceivable to me how an 
airport of any size could be located next to a pristine wilderness area -- this 
just does not make sense!" 
</P>
<P>
Two other sites also deemed worthy of consideration by the Orange County 
Airport Site Coalition were Potrero Los Pinos, a plateau in eastern Orange 
County on Cleveland National Forest land, and at March Air Force Base near 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sulzer, executive director of the San Diego County Assn. of Governments, 
denied a statement by Leland Oliver, president of the airport site coalition, 
that San Diego and Riverside counties refused to cooperate with the site 
selection group and "wouldn't come to our party." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver told the Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday that "we tried 
and tried" to involve the San Diego association in the three-year search for a 
site but its officials did not respond to numerous telephone calls and letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past two years or so, we have exchanged considerable information 
(with Orange County) and talked about various things that affected San Diego 
County," Sulzer explained. "We -- our executive board of local elected 
officials -- have repeatedly said that Camp Pendleton is not a candidate site." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Assn. of Governments, which represents the county's 18 
cities and county government, has gone on record unanimously designating Camp 
Pendleton as a buffer separating San Diego County from Orange and Los Angeles 
counties. If the Marine Corps base is ever abandoned by the Pentagon, Sulzer 
said, the sprawling base should be retained as an open-space buffer. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) was more direct: "I am adamantly opposed (to the 
Camp Pendleton airport site) and will fight it until it's dead." 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps responded to the latest Orange County airport site proposal by 
repeating an official position first issued early last year which states, in 
part: 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that a regional airport could be located anywhere on Camp 
Pendleton without seriously degrading or curtailing all the training we do 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Such an airport, with its extensive infrastructure and traffic patterns, would 
effectively terminate training and operations at Camp Pendleton. . . . We will 
take every measure necessary to prevent that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County supervisors also were less than receptive to the coalition's 
recommendations for the Cristianitos and Camp Pendleton sites, but voted to 
refer the report to county staff for a 60-day review. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, a key Orange County official said the coalition's report was "dead 
on arrival" because each of the recommended sites had significant environmental 
and political obstacles, including strong opposition locally and from 
government agencies ranging from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the U.S. 
Forest Service and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition leader Oliver told supervisors that the county will need to serve 
22.2 million airline passengers by the year 2010, which is 14.8 million more 
than John Wayne Airport is permitted to handle under a 1985 court settlement.

MINIMUM SETBACKS, LOT SIZES ESTABLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To keep tighter control on the size and type of apartment complexes being built 
throughout the city, the City Council passed an ordinance establishing a 
minimum for lot sizes and setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance increases setback requirements -- the area between the structure 
and the street or property line -- from 10 to 15 feet in front, back and side 
yards. It also calls for minimum lot sizes of 12,500 square feet and minimum 
lot widths of 100 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Moving the building back from the street allows more space for landscaping, 
officials said. The ordinance, which was passed by a unanimous vote, goes into 
effect in 30 days.

SHERIFF CANDIDATE VOWS ETHICS UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton City Councilman Don Bankhead, who is challenging Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates in the June election, kicked off his campaign Thursday by 
promising to "bring integrity back" to the county's highest law enforcement 
post. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech to about 75 people, the retired Fullerton police captain 
capitalized on civil rights lawsuits filed against Gates and said that, if 
elected, he would establish an ethics unit and make such lawsuits unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put the shine back on the badge and we'll all have a good clean 
Sheriff's Department," Bankhead said. "If no one's rights are violated, we 
won't get sued." 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead, 57, challenged Gates to justify spending nearly $1 million in 
taxpayers' dollars to settle two civil rights lawsuits filed against him and to 
explain why some of the terms of the settlements were sealed until after the 
March election filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The county recently agreed to pay $475,000 to settle two lawsuits filed by 
Preston Guillory, a private investigator and former political opponent of 
Gates. But the total cost in payouts and attorney fees has been about $1 
million for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The county also paid $375,000 in 1987 to settle a lawsuit by Orange County 
Municipal Judge Bobby Youngblood, an outspoken opponent of Gates and one-time 
sheriff's candidate. All three lawsuits contended that Gates used the 
department to investigate his political enemies and hurt his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
George Wright, a Rancho Santiago College instructor and longtime Gates critic 
who shared part of a recent lawsuit settlement, told the gathering in Fullerton 
that it is time for a new sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people of this county are going to have stand up and say it's time to 
change things, time to get an honest person in there who can distinguish 
between politics and law enforcement," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Novick, a retired deputy district attorney who headed the district 
attorney's Laguna Niguel office, said Gates frequently exerts pressure on the 
district attorney to file charges he wants to see filed and to withhold those 
that he does not. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

ALCOHOL-TREATMENT TEAM TO VISIT LATVIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four alcoholism-treatment specialists from Orange County will leave Saturday on 
a two-week trip to Latvia to conduct a seminar on substance abuse for Soviet 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
The trip is designed to explain to Soviet physicians the latest American 
treatment programs for female alcoholics and is one of an increasing number of 
exchange programs between medical experts of the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The alcohol problem (in the Soviet Union) is much larger than the one we have 
here," said Karen Stockman, a director of New Directions for Women, a 
nonprofit, residential treatment program in Costa Mesa. "What they're doing (in 
treatment) now isn't working." 
</P>
<P>
Stockman, along with Kay Brown, executive director of New Directions, and Costa 
Mesa therapists Rita McCabe and Tom Gullett will make the trip to Riga, the 
capital of the Republic of Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar will stress family involvement in alcohol treatment and attempts to 
erase the stigma often associated with substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of this is a new concept to them," Stockman said. The Soviets treat 
alcoholism "in a more punitive sort of way than we do."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
MAN HELD IN SERIES OF OBSCENE CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Irvine man was arrested Thursday for impersonating a sheriff's deputy and 
making a series of obscene telephone calls to women in various Orange County 
areas, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. William Francis said deputies seized several security agent 
badges, police-type clothing, a police baton and a Taser gun when they arrested 
David T. Avery, 22, at his home in unincorporated Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies also found 15 stolen credit cards at the residence, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
Avery was booked on suspicion of making lewd phone calls, impersonating a peace 
officer and possession of stolen property, Francis said. The suspect had been 
under investigation since January when authorities received about 30 reports of 
obscene phone calls from women throughout the county, Francis said. The suspect 
is being held in Orange County Jail on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators obtained a search warrant for the suspect's home after one of the 
victims recorded one of the obscene calls. 
</P>
<P>
"What (the caller) would do is place his call to a female victim, and would 
identify himself as Deputy Sheriff Wilson," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect would tell his victims that he had planted illegal drugs on their 
property, and warned them he would have them arrested for possession of 
narcotics unless they did as he ordered, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he got the victims to believe his story, he would then inquire as to what 
they were wearing, then directed them to perform sexual acts," Francis said.

SHIP PLANS 22-PORT TRIP ALONG COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since boarding the 145-foot Californian in Dana Point 11 days ago, a crew of 
teen-age sailors from the San Diego area have spent much of their time swabbing 
decks and unfurling sails. 
</P>
<P>
And as the April 22 observance of Earth Day approaches, the Californian, a 
replica of a 19th-Century tall ship, promises the same for other teen-agers 
along the state's coast when it embarks Monday on a 22-port journey. The 
Californian will carry a message about the importance of the ocean environment 
as it journeys north along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers' stint aboard the tall ship was a real-life lesson in marine 
ecology and served as a firsthand look at the numerous threats to sea life and 
California's fragile 1,200-mile coastline. Even plastic bottles tossed 
carelessly into the ocean are proving dangerous to marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish and the sea gulls think they are food and choke on them," said 
16-year-old Elyse Olson, who spent Thursday afternoon scrubbing decks and 
shining brass fittings after the ship docked in Marina del Rey. The ship's home 
port is Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old ship's first stop on its seven-month journey -- called Coast 
Link 90, The Year of Ocean Literacy -- will be San Francisco, where visitors 
will walk the decks and view a recycling exhibit on Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
The ship will sail as far north as Eureka before turning south at the end of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the ship's eight-member crew will be augmented by other 
environmentally conscious groups to spread the word that the ocean is a finite 
resource that needs special treatment, said Steve Christman, director of the 
Dana Point-based Nautical Heritage Society. 
</P>
<P>
The society, which owns the sailing vessel, decided to launch the project last 
year because of concerns about mounting threats to the California coastline. 
Those concerns peaked, Christman said, during the recent Huntington Beach oil 
spill when miles of Orange County shoreline were fouled by black, gooey 
residue. As a result, the issue of offshore oil drilling, Christman said, is 
again a hot topic. 
</P>
<P>
"During our port visits, people kept talking about these issues," Christman 
said. "We want the citizens of this state to become more and more aware of how 
closely related the environment is to their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
The tour is being funded by Pepsi-Cola and the city of Chula Vista, Christman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In each port, visitors to the ship will be asked to sign a "Coastal Pledge," to 
help stop pollution of the ocean and the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking people to take an active role," Christman said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental lessons are also taught to the student "cadets," who spend 11 
days at a time on the ship, learning how to avoid using environmentally harmful 
products, such as plastic foam products, plastic utensils and similar products. 
In addition, all paper and aluminum goods used on board are recycled, and even 
tuna has been scratched from the ship's menu as a protest over the killing of 
dolphins by some commercial fishermen. JAMES M. GOMEZ

<P>
MAN'S LEGS CRUSHED BY FREIGHT TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old man was critically injured Thursday when his legs were crushed by 
a freight train. 
</P>
<P>
Both his legs were amputated during surgery at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Cruz, who authorities believe is from Mexico, apparently was trying 
to jump onto the Santa Fe train when he fell under the moving cars, said Lt. 
Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred near Camino Capistrano and Doheny Park Road about 8:40 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
where surgery was performed Thursday afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Santa Fe said that the 52-car train was going from San Diego to 
Barstow and had stopped at a siding around the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, Santa Fe spokesman, estimated the train was traveling at about 10 
m.p.h. when the accident occurred.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
WHEN HISTORY IS MADE OF CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Trust is involved in some fascinating work to preserve and 
stabilize historic Spanish missions in Southern California. One such project at 
Mission San Juan Capistrano, now in the infancy stage, could have far-reaching 
implications for protecting historic adobe structures throughout the state from 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
Missions are threatened by more than earthquakes. At Mission San Juan 
Capistrano, returning swallows will find the Great Stone Church wrapped in 
scaffolding during the next few years while a preservation project stabilizes 
and refaces crumbling sandstone. The Getty Conservation Institute, under the 
umbrella of the trust, is offering some support. Also, the trust has just 
announced a timely grant of $50,000 to San Gabriel Mission in Los Angeles 
County for emergency repairs and for a detailed restoration analysis. 
</P>
<P>
But the pioneering work will be in the institute's efforts to assemble at San 
Juan Capistrano a collaborative project on adobe seismic stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
The institute has already begun research at a field project in New Mexico to 
preserve adobe from the ravages of weathering. The mission project will take it 
further, to consider earthquake protection. The institute hopes to bring 
together experts and project engineers already at the mission. The ambitious 
goal is for new and accepted methods of damage control. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, historic adobes have easily fallen victim to earthquakes. And their 
dwindling number makes this project a race against time. The trust and mission 
consultants are to be commended for this initiative in preserving the state's 
historic architecture.

SLAYER OF 2 TEEN-AGERS HAS LIFE SPARED BY JURY

<P>
An Orange County jury Thursday decided against a death verdict for gang member 
Mario Tirado, convicted of murdering two teen-agers on bicycles, and voted 
instead that he be sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Tirado reacted to the verdict with a slight smile and got a pat on the shoulder 
from his attorneys. But members of his family -- many of whom traveled almost 
2,000 miles from their home in Vista Hermosa, Mexico -- sobbed openly in 
relief. Tirado's grandmother, Guadalupe Cortez, had to be helped from the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"We are thankful to God that Mario does not have to die," said Anna Leal, one 
of his sisters. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, who had convicted Tirado last month, took a day and a half to 
decide his penalty. 
</P>
<P>
If jurors had chosen death, Tirado, at age 21, would have been the youngest 
person ever sent to Death Row from Orange County since the state restored 
capital punishment 12 years ago. Tirado was convicted of first-degree murder 
after a four-month trial for the Oct. 30, 1987, shooting deaths of Enrique 
Arceo, 13, and Jesus Perez, 17. They were returning from a church carnival on 
bicycles with several others, witnesses said, when Tirado opened fire in a 
drive-by shooting. Tirado was also convicted of six attempted murders, 
including other victims in that incident and several from a shooting incident 
earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
A witness who had been in the car with Tirado testified that he, Tirado and 
Patrick McCauley, 24, the driver -- all from different branches of the F-Troop 
gang -- were out searching for Lopers, members of a rival gang, because of 
friction between the gangs a few weeks earlier. The two teen-age victims were 
known to be associated with the Lopers. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors were hung 11 to 1 in favor of a first-degree murder conviction on 
McCauley, who will be retried. Prosecutors had not asked for the death penalty 
in his case. The same jurors found Tirado guilty, plus special circumstances of 
double murder, which allowed prosecutors to seek a death verdict against him. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors were limited to two choices. Thursday, after they decided on the 
lesser sentence of life without parole, most of them declined to discuss their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
But one juror, Loyd Kilby of Mission Viejo, said the majority of them thought 
that "this just wasn't the right case for the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe very firmly in the death penalty," Kilby said, "but this kid had no 
prior record; he just isn't one of the monsters I think should go to the gas 
chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the jurors indicated to the lawyers involved that Tirado's youth -- he 
was just 18 when the shootings occurred -- was a big factor in deciding on the 
lesser penalty. But Otha Standifer III, one of Tirado's attorneys, said he is 
convinced that Tirado's religious conversion since the shootings, which was a 
major part of the defense during the penalty phase of the trial, made the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Mario has changed; he's more mature, with better moral judgment," Standifer 
said. "It would have been absolutely unnecessary for him to be sent to the gas 
chamber." 
</P>
<P>
The defense presented more than 30 witnesses during the penalty phase -- 14 of 
them from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen of Tirado's relatives sat outside in the hallway for two days 
awaiting the jury verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton appeared only mildly disappointed at 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This case was strictly a jury call," he said. "We thought the crime was 
serious enough that we should present the death penalty as something for them 
to consider. But I have no problems with their decision. They were an extremely 
conscientious group of jurors." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Standifer said the jurors wanted to know afterward if there 
was a chance Tirado might be freed from prison someday. The law does have 
provisions for a governor to reduce a life-without-parole sentence. But no one 
has yet been in prison long enough under a life-without-parole sentence to have 
the provisions tested. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the courtroom throughout the trial, and during the reading of 
Thursday's verdict, were members of the two victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not all that unusual during gang cases," Middleton said. "We had a lot 
of F-Troop gang members in here during this trial. The fear of retaliation is 
very real to these folks."

MIKE PENNER: READ IT AND WEEP: ANGELS NEED HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new baseball book arrived in the mail the other day and its pages on the 
Angels suggest that Mike Port is spending entirely too much time eating and 
sleeping these days. 
</P>
<P>
Do the Angels need an outfielder? 
</P>
<P>
According to Tom Seaver, the Angels need an offense. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Seaver has lent his name to a collection of scouting 
reports that mince few words and many reputations. Seaver's 1990 Scouting 
Notebook, published by The Sporting News, offers one-page critiques of 360 
major league players, based on interviews with scouts and front office 
personnel, and ranks them by position, exposing flaws, warts and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel pitching acquits itself well, which is no surprise. Chuck Finley, 
Mark Langston and Jim Abbott are all ranked among the American League's top 10 
left-handed starters and Bert Blyleven is No. 8 among right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angel batting order takes a beating. Of the eight regular position 
players, only two -- Wally Joyner and Lance Parrish -- are ranked above ninth 
against their American League peers. Brian Downing is sixth among designated 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
How the Angels didn't score -- and some selected comments from the book: 
</P>
<P>
First Base: Wally Joyner 
</P>
<P>
Rank: Fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyner is a classic victim of great expectations. But it's his own fault. When 
he blasted 56 home runs and drove in 217 runs over his first two major league 
seasons, he set a pace that was too high for his talent level. . . . 'I think 
we all found out that he is not the prototype power hitter we thought he was 
going to be,' one scout said. 'He's still a very good first baseman, but he's 
certainly not among the elite.' " 
</P>
<P>
Second Base: Johnny Ray 
</P>
<P>
Rank: Ninth (behind Jerry Browne and Nelson Liriano, to name two). 
</P>
<P>
"His defensive flaws are numerous: He never seems to be in position, he has 
stiff hands, he has difficulty turning the double play and he has a weak arm. . 
. . But the Angels can live with those deficiencies because Ray is an offensive 
machine. . . . (Ray) figures to continue his consistent production for several 
more years. The Angels, weak defense or not, realize that Ray has been a key 
figure in their recent rise to challenger status in the tough American League 
West Division." 
</P>
<P>
Third Base: Jack Howell 
</P>
<P>
Rank: Ninth (behind Craig Worthington and Brook Jacoby). 
</P>
<P>
"He is a self-made player who gets the most out of his ability. But some 
question whether that is enough to keep him in the regular lineup at the major 
league level and the Angels, understandably, would like more production from 
the third baseman. . . . Howell strikes out much too often (125 times last 
season, 130 times in 1988) and he has a horrible time hitting fellow 
left-handers (a .140 mark last year, a .123 average in 1987), suggesting that 
he might be better off in a platoon situation." 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop: Dick Schofield 
</P>
<P>
Rank: Ninth (behind Jody Reed and Greg Gagne). 
</P>
<P>
"Schofield is a low-ball hitter who can't stop chasing high fastballs. . . . A 
man with limited power (his best home-run season was 13 in 1986), Schofield 
will hit a homer and then spend the next two weeks trying to hit another. That 
results in far too many fly balls for a hitter who should be trying to keep it 
on the ground. . . . He just can't seem to make offensive adjustments and 
scouts now believe he never will become a consistently productive big-league 
hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Outfield: Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
Rank: 11th (behind Dave Henderson). 
</P>
<P>
"The young switch-hitter is a wild swinger who makes life easy on opposing 
pitchers. . . . Because of his excellent power potential, pitchers rarely will 
throw White a fastball. Instead, they feed him a steady diet of breaking balls 
and off-speed pitches -- and they don't even have to throw them in the strike 
zone. . . . White is one of the best pure athletes in the American League and 
one of its top underachievers. The Angels, once convinced that this slender 
27-year-old would develop into a superstar, now are growing impatient." 
</P>
<P>
Outfield: Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Rank: 14th (behind Ken Griffey Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
"Considering his shaky defense, Davis could make the transition to designated 
hitter earlier than others. . . . He's still an undisciplined hitter who is 
susceptible to strikeouts. Over the last three seasons, Davis has fanned 109, 
118 and 109 times. Pitchers have some success with fastballs above the letters, 
but he'll convert their mistakes into extra bases." 
</P>
<P>
Outfield: Claudell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Unranked. 
</P>
<P>
"Left-handers can prevent Washington from driving the ball by changing speeds 
and throwing breaking balls in the dirt. Over the last two seasons, he has hit 
just one of his 24 home runs against left-handers and had only five RBIs 
against them in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Designated Hitter: Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
Rank: Sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"Downing's bat has slowed considerably and hard throwers now can get their 
fastball past him. Pitchers who change speeds can make him look foolish because 
he is a notorious guess hitter who tends to overswing. . . . Perhaps the most 
telling statistics of his 1989 season were his 56 walks and 87 strikeouts -- 
almost the opposite of what you would normally expect. It wasn't too many years 
ago that Downing was so proficient at drawing walks and getting on base that 
then-California Manager Gene Mauch used him as a leadoff hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher: Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Rank: Second. 
</P>
<P>
"No longer the power threat that he was in Detroit, where he averaged 30 home 
runs from 1982 through '85, he still is dangerous when he gets a pitch that 
allows him to extend his massive arms. . . . With advancing age, the 
33-year-old Parrish has become vulnerable to right-handed pitchers who can get 
ahead in the count and tempt him with low breaking pitches away. . . . Parrish 
is so slow that infielders can play him extremely deep and cut off many 
potential hits."

<P>
In 1982, Don Watson lost his first dual meet as coach of the Orange Coast 
College women's swimming team. He has yet to lose another one. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Orange Coast women have won 68 consecutive dual meets, and 
today the Pirates will try to defeat Saddleback in Mission Viejo and apparently 
establish a record for consecutive victories for a California community college 
team in any sport. 
</P>
<P>
Although such records are not kept by the state, Orange Coast officials have 
determined that three teams -- including the Pirates -- have won 68 consecutive 
community college events. Long Beach had a 12-year men's track winning streak 
ended at 68 last week when it lost to Mt. San Antonio, and between 1979 and 
1981 Golden West won 68 consecutive water polo matches. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of Orange Coast's 16 swimmers return from last season's team, which won 
the Pirates' fifth state championship in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's swimming dynasty says a lot about the area and the school. All but one 
of the women's team members are from Orange County, a strong pool of swimming 
talent. More Orange Coast students transfer to four-year schools than from any 
other community college in the state, and many of the 12,500 full-time students 
are attracted by that academic record. 
</P>
<P>
But in the pool, much of the success can be attributed to Watson's training 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Although the training program is difficult, this is no meat market. Watson 
fancies himself an educator and hopes that he can help his athletes develop as 
people as well. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's No. 1 goal is for each of his athletes to graduate from a four-year 
institution. All swimmers -- including members of the men's team, which has 
finished second in the state meet the past two seasons -- are taking courses 
that can be transferred as general education credits at four-year institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on the team would consider it a major negative event if somebody 
failed to graduate from a four-year school," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
The swimmers know that if a swimmer regularly misses class, Watson may hold her 
out of a meet, even the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
"If it means we are not going to win state without the person, then we are not 
going to win state," said Celina Lemke, a sophomore who finished third in the 
200-yard freestyle, fourth in the 400 free and seventh in the 100 breaststroke 
in the state meet last year. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Pirates' success in dual meets -- Watson said they haven't come 
close to losing one since 1984 -- winning is taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know we were on a winning streak," said Karen Palitschek, who 
won the state title in the 50 and 100 butterfly last season. 
</P>
<P>
That's just fine with Watson, who says it's more important to get his swimmers 
to "do the right thing when no one is looking" than worry about winning dual 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
After the Orange Coast women finished second in the 1988 state meet after 
winning four consecutive state titles, rival coaches sought Watson out to 
console him. Palomar Coach Greg Ormsby put it in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg looked at me and asked, 'How many of your kids are going on to four-year 
schools?' " Watson said. "I said all of them, and he chuckled and said, 'The 
real streak is still intact.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't lose a wink of sleep over (second place)."

</P>
<P>
Engesser, a freshman, won the 800 meters in 2 minutes 36 seconds, the 1,600 in 
5:33 and anchored the 1,600-meter relay team to victory. In the 400, she placed 
second in 1:03.6.

But victories in the field events gave Ocean View an unexpected boost.

event in 16-8 3/4, and also won the 400 (1:03.3).

And the Sea Hawks' Michelle Garay, who has been slowed by injuries most of the 
season, won the triple jump in a season-best 35-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I really felt this would be our toughest meet," Ocean View Coach Beth Chilcott 
said. "We got some luck today, people came through with good marks. I knew the 
field events would be the turning point. And the relays." 
</P>
<P>

the final pass.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Kennedy High School-Garden Grove game, which figured to show the dominant 
softball team in the Garden Grove League, was suspended at a 1-1 tie after 20 
innings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After four hours, plate umpire Ed Staab called the game because of darkness, 
but not before both teams proved why they are tops in their league and among 
the county's best. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove, ranked fifth in the Orange County Softball Coaches' poll, and 
Kennedy, ranked sixth, mirrored each other with stellar defensive plays, strong 
pitching and good hitting. Both teams are 6-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams used a walk, an error and a hit in the second inning to score. 
</P>
<P>
With no outs, Kennedy pitcher Cheryl Longeway reached first on an error. 
Andrina Hustead walked and both runners advanced on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Gragnano struck out. Shortstop Nicole Paloney singled to drive in 
Longeway. Smith then struck out Angie La Carte and got Danielle McLeod to pop 
out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the second, Becky Eggers walked. Brandie Novack bunted and 
Longeway's throw pulled first baseman Gragnano off the bag for an error. Eggers 
injured her ankle going to second and was replaced by Maria Romero. Nakia 
Houston grounded out, advancing the runners to second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Romero tried to score from third on Stephanie Mareina's ground ball, but 
Longeway threw her out at the plate. Garden Grove finally scored when Celeste 
Gordon lined a single to left, scoring Novack. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove left 19 runners on base, Kennedy 13. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw us out by half a step and my girls are quick," Kennedy Coach Sue 
Hall said. "The defense in general, including the pitching, dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Longeway (8-1) struck out 10, walked five and hit one. Smith (14-3) struck out 
17, walked two and hit one. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy looked as if it would end the game in the top of the 15th inning when 
Lana Jimenez bunted for a single and took second on an error. One out later, 
Longeway singled to left. Jimenez, Kennedy's fastest runner, rounded third but 
Hall called her back. Jimenez eventually was tagged out at home to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have sent her," Hall said, later. "I played it too cautious." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Santiago 7, Bolsa Grande 4 -- Leanne Stoneking drove in the winning run in the 
fifth inning at Bolsa Grande. Jessica Sulsona (3-7) pitched a one-hitter for 
Santiago (4-8, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 2, Los Amigos 1 -- Jill Bishop had two hits and Nicole Eisley had a 
hit and an RBI to lead visiting La Quinta (8-6, 5-1).

UNSIGNED REPORT BLAMED IN STOCK-TRADING FRENZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trading in Southland Communications' stock, which was suspended Wednesday by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, became volatile after March 2 when a 
critical, unsigned research report about the firm was circulated on Wall 
Street, brokers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that brokers sell the stock short, or speculate that the 
price would go down because of the Santa Ana-based company's weak financial 
state. Instead, the price nearly doubled in a month and investors who held 
short positions in the paging services firm's stock now stand to lose millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The report allegedly was issued by K.A. Knapp &amp; Co., the firm which helped 
take Southland Communications public in 1987, according to several brokers who 
shorted the stock based on the report's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Knapp, which is under bankruptcy court protection, could not be 
reached for comment. The company is based in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp &amp; Co.'s former owner, Kirk A. Knapp, was permanently barred from 
doing business in the securities industry in January after the SEC and the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers brought charges of fraud and other 
regulatory violations against Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
The federal judge that barred Knapp alleged that the former broker bilked 
investors out of thousands of dollars in activities that date back to 1985. The 
firm closed in November, 1987, citing a capital shortfall after the stock 
market crash on Oct. 19, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It reopened in December, 1988, when it was purchased by longtime Knapp 
associate John Pehrson, and last year filed for protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11. In pointing out why the company's stock was likely to fall, the 
report noted that Southland's auditors stated that there was substantial doubt 
that the company could continue to function as a going concern. 
</P>
<P>
After the report appeared, the trading volume of Southland stock grew to frenzy 
levels -- rising from a normal level of 10,000 shares a day to more than 
several hundred thousand on several recent days. The stock price, meanwhile, 
climbed from about $9 a share on March 2 to $17 on April 3, despite the lack of 
any positive news about the company and its financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
The "suspicious" trading drew the scrutiny of over-the-counter market 
officials, securities dealers and the SEC. The agency said it halted trading 
because of questions about the identity of the owners of the company's common 
and preferred stock, about an accumulation of large volumes of the stock by 
several broker-dealers and their customers, and a possible failure to disclose 
a change in control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
In documents filed with the SEC on Oct. 31, auditor KPMG Peat Marwick, Main 
&amp; Co. issued a qualified opinion that said Southland's "recurring losses 
from operations and working-capital deficit raises substantial doubt about the 
company's potential to continue as a going concern." 
</P>
<P>
The company's first quarter financial performance also was dismal. For the 
three months ended Jan. 31, 1990, the company lost $323,529 on revenue of $1.9 
million, compared to a net loss of $258,975 on revenue of $1.4 million in a 
like period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Based on such weak fundamentals, brokers said there was no logical market 
reason why the stock volume increased sharply and the price rose 86% from early 
March to $16.75 when trading was halted for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The trading pattern is suspicious," said David Schechter, a vice president 
with Homans, McGraw, Trull, Vallejo &amp; Co., a broker-dealer in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Bayaa, Southland's president, did not return calls for comment. In 
mid-March, he issued a statement saying that the company had "no idea" what 
caused the volatile trading and price rise. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers described the trading after the research report surfaced as a "classic 
short squeeze." In that scenario, brokers who speculated that the stock would 
go down were caught in a jam as the stock price rose. The price increase forced 
them to "cover" their positions with more expensive shares and further 
escalated the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The squeeze is ended either by taking losses or regulatory action. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC suspects that several brokerages may have held concentrated positions 
in Southland stock without disclosing that they controlled more than 5% of the 
company's stock as required by federal securities law, several brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major market makers involved with the Southland trading was B.C. 
Financial in Atlanta, several brokers said. A principal with B.C. Financial, 
Stuart Cohen, was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas in 
an unrelated securities-fraud case involving penny stocks. He could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual trading activity in Southland's stock came to a head Tuesday when 
the company said it wanted to increase the exchange rate on its convertible 
preferred stock. After that announcement, the SEC stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
Southland, which provides electronic paging services for individual and 
business subscribers, does business in Orange County as National Paging Co. It 
was founded by Bayaa in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The company stated in March that it was seeking to raise $5 million through a 
private stock placement to foreign investors, but Bayaa later said the deal 
would not be completed as expected by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the funds were to be used to acquire A+ Beepers of California in 
Torrance, but Pacific Bell has filed a complaint with the California Public 
Utilities Commission seeking to block the merger.

ICN Biomedicals Inc. The Costa Mesa-based maker of medical instruments and test 
kits said net income for the first quarter reached a record $1.9 million, 
compared to $942,000 reported for the comparable period last year. Sales for 
the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose to nearly $33 million from $12.9 million. The 
company said the gains in revenue and earnings for the first quarter were 
attributable to continued strength of its base business as well as the 
consolidation into its operations of Flow Laboratories, which it acquired in 
November.

FLAMBOYANT GUITAR SLINGER POUNDS OUT BLUES

Walter Trout marked a milestone Wednesday night with his first show as a 
headliner at the Coach House, but the performance's eruption of passion and 
hyper-driven energy is almost a standard night's work for this uncommonly 
dynamic Orange County blues player. 
</P>
<P>
Trout's path to top billing at the county's leading concert club wasn't easy. 
When he first came here from Philadelphia in 1974, looking to establish himself 
as a hot guitar slinger, he couldn't find a niche in the local blues scene and 
had to settle for twanging in country bands. But he persisted, and touring 
stints with Canned Heat and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers established him as a 
well-traveled, well-regarded sideman. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach resident left Mayall to go solo a year ago. While he has 
made progress in Scandinavia with several tours and an album release, Trout is 
still trying to establish himself as a big fish in the American blues-rock 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from his show Wednesday night, all the qualifications are in place. For 
one thing, Trout is a legitimate keeper of the blues-rocker-as-gladiator 
tradition handed down from Buddy Guy to Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughan, 
achieving a showman's flash as well as an ace player's precision. Trout also 
has a strong, flexible natural voice that he embellished with a husky blues 
growl or a Little Richard falsetto cry. And his band was first rate. Dan 
(Mongo) Abrams, on Hammond organ, and drummer Allen Adams both stood out when 
they got the spotlight. Abrams consistently created parts that were nimble but 
meaty, recalling the Band's Garth Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour concert ranged widely, from Trout's driving, dark anthem about 
street violence, "Life in the Jungle," to jaunty barroom blues-rock excursions, 
to emotive readings of agonized classics like John Lee Hooker's "Serve Me Right 
to Suffer" and Robert Johnson's "Love in Vain." Trout, who dedicated the show 
to the memory of Sarah Vaughan, reached for the unexpected with a moving, 
achingly soulful version of Bob Dylan's "Girl From the North Country." It's a 
dimension that Trout should have explored further with "The Mountain Song" and 
"Frederica," two fine wistful numbers from his album that went unplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Slimmed down considerably from his paunchy Bluesbreakers days (Mayall used to 
jokingly refer to Trout and the band's other guitarist, Coco Montoya, as "the 
belly brothers"), Trout put on a show that was equal parts visual excitement 
and sonic sizzle. He wielded his Stratocaster guitar like a trophy or a lance, 
with all the paroxysms of battle showing on his face and in his playing stance. 
</P>
<P>
That Samurai guitarist approach can be dangerous: battalions of would-be heavy 
metal heroes have made ridiculous spectacles of themselves with moves similar 
to Trout's. The difference is that Trout's flamboyance springs from the 
emotions of the moment, not from some calculated attempt to strike a guitar 
hero's pose. It's a natural thing, like the frenzy of a salmon on its last 
headlong run. 
</P>
<P>
The other risk in Trout's approach is the prolific amount of playing he does. 
His guitar style is fast, propulsive and accelerating -- on slow blues as well 
as quick-paced shuffles and rockers. Trout saved himself from the tedium of 
overplaying by working his speeding stream of notes into clean, coherent 
phrases that always made melodic sense. But his cornucopia of near-continuous 
soloing became, after a while, too much of a good thing. Confronted with so 
much sound streaming from Trout's guitar, one began to long for space and 
spareness, the eloquence of the pauses between notes. He did achieve contrast 
with quieter passages in which he worked the strings to achieve a tone 
reminiscent of a bowed violin. But Trout resorted to that trick a few times too 
many. 
</P>
<P>
Trout's fast musical metabolism seems to be an inbred part of his makeup -- the 
natural fuse that sets off his exciting performances. Perhaps economy and 
restraint are just not part of that makeup. But if he could create a tension 
between restraint and his natural wildness, the excitement might become even 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
There's not much excitement in an unknown band copying a famous band that isn't 
worth copying. That, unfortunately, is what local newcomers Love of Fire did by 
fashioning an opening set that did INXS to excess. Singer Roger Benes echoed 
the reedy tone and drawling voice inflections of INXS pinup Michael Hutchence. 
But instead of matching the Australian singer's lively stage presence, the 
languid Benes was only slightly less placid than a disc jockey working the 
overnight shift. The five-member, keyboards-dominated band was precise and 
polished with its neatly scrubbed rock-funk, but its 40-minute show fell into a 
mid-tempo rut of unremarkable songs about romance. One song, "Stand for Me," 
had a taut, pleading tone that gave it enough of an edge to sustain interest.

<P>
For the fourth year in a row, the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana has been 
named country nightclub of the year by the Academy of Country Music. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement Wednesday by the Los Angeles-based academy was a prelude to 
its 25th annual awards ceremony, which NBC will broadcast from the Pantages 
Theatre in Hollywood on April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Other preliminary awards announced in non-musical categories were country disc 
jockey of the year, won by Jon Conlon of WGKX in Memphis, and country radio 
station of the year, won by WSIX in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
The Crazy Horse came out on top in a vote by managers, agents and bookers who 
deal with nightclubs, as well as by record company personnel and other music 
industry insiders. Fred Reiser, who runs the Crazy Horse, is president of the 
Academy of Country Music. Reiser also has received honors from the rival 
Country Music Assn., which is based in Nashville. The CMA named Reiser its 
promoter of the year for 1988-89. MIKE BOEHM

'TROUBLED WATERS' QUESTIONS CONTROL, DOMINANCE OF NATURE

<P>
Five thousand deer are starving in a Florida game preserve, their food sources 
depleted by natural and man-made disasters. Should they be "thinned out" in a 
controlled hunt, or "saved" in a risky relocation effort? 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kral's "Troubled Waters," presented by the Laguna Playhouse Youth 
Theatre, challenges children and adults to consider these and other questions 
about humankind's control over nature. Directed by Scott Davidson, the 
production closes this weekend at the Moulton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Kral and Davidson both deserve credit. Kral's script is surprisingly well 
balanced, treating a sensitive issue in a way that is neither shrill nor 
preachy. Davidson has shown similar restraint, guiding his talented young cast 
to performances that are powerful without being melodramatic. As a result, 
audience members are allowed to think through the problem and reach their own 
conclusions, a refreshing opportunity in an issues-oriented play. 
</P>
<P>
According to Davidson, "Troubled Waters" was inspired by a 1982 incident in 
which thousands of deer were dying of starvation after drought and floods 
caused, in part, by development of the Florida Everglades. The government 
ultimately approved a controlled hunt of the animals in an effort to reduce the 
demand for the limited natural resources. As reported in the play, about 800 
deer were killed; about 3,800 remained. 
</P>
<P>
"Troubled Waters" follows the emotional struggle of teen-ager J.D. (played in 
alternate performances by Craig Hammill and Josh Wheeler) as he tries to 
determine his stand on the issue. Should he side with his older brother Micheal 
(Raymond Scott and Peter Kreder), an earnest young park ranger who supports the 
hunt? Or does he agree with his sister Sandra (Danielle McDermott), an 
idealistic student who promotes moving the deer out of the area, even though 
many of them would be endangered by the process? As the day of the hunt 
approaches, the family tension mounts as J.D. tries to resolve the conflict 
between his emotions and his logic. 
</P>
<P>
Confused, J.D. turns to his friend Bet (Kari Geller and Rebekah Baker), a 
tomboyish young Seminole Indian. Bet supports neither side of the argument and, 
instead, shares some of the legends that speak of her ancestors' desire to 
coexist with, rather than control, nature. 
</P>
<P>
Ritualistic movements based loosely on Seminole ceremonial dances adds 
authenticity to this play. A deer (Brigitte Paulicivic) and two Indian maids 
(Sabrina Harper and Jillian Longnecker) provide a fluid, ever-changing backdrop 
to the story. In several touching scenes, the deer becomes the central figure, 
moving center stage to interact with J.D. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, who choreographed the moves, directed the cast in research of the 
Seminole movement and chant as part of the rehearsal process. 
</P>
<P>
All the performances in Saturday's 4 p.m. performance were good, but 
12-year-old Craig Hammill was especially strong as J.D., switching easily from 
a wisecracking little boy to a troubled young man. Kari Geller and Brigitte 
Paulicivic, both 17, were noteworthy as Bet and the deer. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Davidson and his cast will carry "Troubled Waters" to West Germany 
to take part in the first International Children's Theatre Festival, which runs 
April 13 to 21. Although other groups from the United States are likely to 
attend, the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre is the official U.S. representative 
to the festival, which will include about 18 performance groups from Eastern 
and Western Europe, the Soviet Union and the Middle East.

RANDY LEWIS: SO, WHAT DOES A ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSICIAN REALLY LOOK LIKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Police Department, in a quest for information in the 
unsolved murder last month of a rock-band manager, has released a bulletin 
saying the victim was last seen accompanied by someone "described as having a 
rock 'n' roll musician appearance." 
</P>
<P>
Now just what might that be? 
</P>
<P>
Frank Zappa? Elton John? Peter Garrett, the bald, 6-foot-6 lead singer of 
Midnight Oil? 
</P>
<P>
Joan Jett? Prince? 
</P>
<P>
Little Richard? Jerry Lee Lewis? Huey Lewis? 
</P>
<P>
Read more closely, the bulletin at least includes a couple of other clues as to 
what this person might look like: "male white in his late 20s or early 30s with 
long, jet-black hair. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm. That doesn't eliminate Elvis. Let's hope The King hasn't survived all 
these years only to turn to a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this guy was seen with a microphone in his hand, an electric guitar slung 
behind his back as he sat atop a stack of Marshall amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the only group that authorities can safely rule out for having "a rock 
'n' roll musician appearance" is anyone who's appeared on stage at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose the police had issued a description saying this person, who is being 
sought for information and not considered a suspect, was described as having a 
lawyer's appearance? Or a golfer's appearance? Or, for that matter, an 
undercover police officer's appearance? 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, at least according to Huntington Beach's finest, all rock 'n' roll 
musicians look like the members of Motley Crue: young, white guys with 
waist-length hair. And, vice-versa -- anyone fitting that description must be a 
rock 'n' roller. 
</P>
<P>
Next time guys, be careful out there.

She'd go shopping on her lunch hour and again after work. Weekends, she'd 
literally shop all day long. But Connie, a 48-year-old, unmarried Anaheim 
apartment complex manager, knew her shopping had gotten out of hand when she 
had trouble holding down a job. "I was totally out of control," she said. "I 
wouldn't go to work; I'd go shopping, and I would do this until I was 
exhausted. "The worst day I can remember, I stood in the middle of the mall 
after shopping all day, and I was crying because my feet hurt so bad. It was 
like I couldn't get out of there. I had to shop some more. I didn't leave until 
the mall closed and the guards asked me to leave." And still she would return 
to shop, feeling panicky if she didn't and falling into a trancelike state as 
she mingled among the clothing racks and display counters and bought things she 
often didn't even need. "I can remember going out and spending $500 for 
clothes," she said. "That was a lot of money for me. I'm not a rich person, but 
I can remember spending $500 and coming back with stuff I couldn't use. I'd 
give a lot of stuff away; a lot of stuff got put in boxes. "It was just 
insane." Connie is a compulsive shopper, one of an estimated 15 million 
Americans who are driven to buy. And, experts say, their buying is frequently 
extravagant, inappropriate and disruptive to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, compulsive shoppers are invariably women. But unlike the 
tongue-in-cheek bumper stickers proclaiming the committed shopper's national 
anthem, "Shop 'til you drop," compulsive shopping is no joking matter. As 
Carolyn Wesson, author of "Women Who Shop Too Much: Overcoming the Urge to 
Splurge," said: "Excessive shopping is a process addiction -- a far cry from 
the traditional, simplistic view of it being something that all women do, like 
having babies. "It is a way of compensating for missing elements and 
shortcomings in a woman's life. All of which give rise to feelings of 
deprivation and the urge to acquire possessions, even useless ones." In 
Connie's case, it wasn't until she had amassed a debt of $18,000 in bad checks 
and overextended credit cards that she finally sought help. "A lot of people 
giggle when they think of being a compulsive shopper. But it's very painful, 
especially when you try to stop," said Connie, who is now a member of the 
self-help group Debtors Anonymous. (Like other compulsive shoppers in this 
story, she asked that her real name not be used.) It's usually not until they 
are deeply in debt that compulsive shoppers seek the help of therapists such as 
Tustin psychologist Amy Stark. 
</P>
<P>
People finally come to her office "not because they're shopping and recognize 
it's a problem, but because they've gotten into such horrendous debt that 
they're in over their heads and they can't solve it," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
And even when they do seek help, overcoming the compulsion to shop is no easy 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Lana, a 30-year-old Mission Viejo mother, remembers leaving her initial 
sessions with Stark and telling herself that she was going to drive straight 
home instead of stopping at a mall. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden my healthy train of thought would be invaded by wanting to buy 
something," she said. "I'd fight with the steering wheel and say to myself, 'Go 
straight! Don't turn! Don't go to the store!' " 
</P>
<P>
Half the time, she said, she would get off at the next off-ramp and turn back 
to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
As with compulsive gambling or eating, therapists say compulsive shoppers have 
an underlying problem that is driving them to shop. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana psychologist Barbara Kreedman said compulsive shopping is often a way 
to feel loved when people felt deprived of love in childhood. It may also be a 
symptom of feeling powerless in a marriage or a matter of low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsive shopping, Kreedman said, is just one avenue of expressing those 
unconscious, unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, our system is not a closed system," she said. "If we continue 
to repress, it's going to come out in one form or another -- anxiety, 
depression, eating disorders, drinking, shopping -- or else our system would 
burst. We have to discharge that energy." 
</P>
<P>
Women typically have more time than men to shop, Kreedman said, and it has 
traditionally been their role to buy for the family. Men, she added, usually 
choose more "grandiose" ways of expressing inner conflicts: buying cars, boats 
or the latest electronic gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsive shopping is not a new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
In her book, Wesson cites Mary Todd Lincoln who, for example, ordered 84 pairs 
of gloves just before moving into the White House and, once there, charged 
extensively to add to her wardrobe. A century later, Jacqueline Kennedy would 
order hundreds of pairs of gloves from designer Oleg Cassini in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos, whose huge walk-in 
palace closet was filled with, among other things, more than 1,000 gowns and 
mink stoles, more than 2,600 pairs of shoes, hundreds of imported leather 
purses, 300 imported 18-carat gold Italian necklaces and five shelves of unused 
Gucci handbags with the price tags still attached. 
</P>
<P>
Few people can afford such extravagance. But because of increased affluence, 
leisure time and loose credit policies, Wesson said, the number of compulsive 
shoppers is larger than ever today. 
</P>
<P>
Not all excessive shopping, however, is a sign of an underlying emotional 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Wesson, a Los Gatos licensed marriage, family and child therapist whose book 
grew out of her own experiences as a "shopaholic," delineates three categories 
of shoppers: 
</P>
<P>
* The recreational shopper's buying doesn't fill any particular deep-seated 
psychological need. Like avid sports fans, these shoppers simply enjoy the 
experience of shopping. 
</P>
<P>
* In the middle are what Wesson calls shopaholics. "They'll use shopping to 
kind of camouflage feelings or as a way of indirectly communicating," she said. 
"A woman who is angry at her husband may go out and do a 'revenge raid,' or 
someone who's depressed may go shopping, but she only does this occasionally. 
They have other ways of coping with problems and unhappy feelings." 
</P>
<P>
* Addicted or compulsive shoppers use buying as their primary way of avoiding 
deep-seated emotional or relationship problems. 
</P>
<P>
One woman Wesson worked with in therapy had accumulated $25,000 in charge card 
debts, "mostly without her husband knowing about it." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these women," Wesson noted, "get PO boxes for the bills." 
</P>
<P>
Although many compulsive shoppers buy clothes, Wesson knows one woman who is a 
"crafts junkie." 
</P>
<P>
For Lucille, a 47-year-old Laguna Beach office administrator, it was books. The 
divorced mother of two grown children and a member of Debtors Anonymous would 
visit bookstores three or four times a week, buying up to 10 books per visit. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't have any space to keep them and had to stack them in boxes in her 
garage, but that didn't stop her from buying more books. Neither did a lack of 
time to read them. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do it," she said. "I could go to the library, but no: I have to 
possess that book." 
</P>
<P>
Compulsive shoppers often spend a major portion of their day shopping. Wesson 
described a woman in her book who lives on an island off the East Coast where 
there aren't many stores. So she would spend six hours a day shopping in hotel 
gift shops and catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
While shopping, Wesson said, compulsive shoppers almost always feel a high -- 
followed by a low of regret, depression, guilt. "And despite the negative 
fallout, they can't stop," she said. "They'd like to stop, but they can't. The 
problem is out of their control." 
</P>
<P>
They are simply buying to buy. "The process becomes addictive, not the items," 
Wesson said. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in treating a compulsive shopper, Wesson said, is for the person 
to acknowledge the problem. "That's pretty obvious, but it's a big step." 
</P>
<P>
She recommends going to therapy or joining Debtors Anonymous, which, like 
Alcoholics Anonymous, offers a 12-step program to overcome compulsive shopping 
and spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Through those processes, they need to begin working on those areas of their 
life that are troubling them," she said. "And they need to develop alternative 
pleasures and interests. They need to find new ways to relax, because a lot of 
what underlies the problem is a lot of anxieties, a lot of tension." 
</P>
<P>
Stark said that when a compulsive shopper first comes to see her, she has them 
lay their cards on the table: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know how many thousands of dollars worth of bills are we talking 
about? Bring in the bills. I want to see them because part of it is, let's deal 
with the embarrassment. I want to see your monthly statements, and I want to 
see them every month." 
</P>
<P>
Stark, in fact, asks clients to bring all their credit cards to her office. 
Then she has them cut them up. When one woman cut up all her cards, Stark 
recalled, "she cried." 
</P>
<P>
She also has them work with a financial adviser who will "monitor their money 
until they get this in check." 
</P>
<P>
Then, she said, "we want to take a look at what's not working: Is it that your 
parents are bugging you? Is your marriage not working? You've got to confront 
the issues and work them through. And then you can do the behavioral 
modification stuff for stopping that behavior." 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Stark said, "I think you have to make sure your credit lines 
everywhere are gone." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, she said, is that even if the customer cuts up her credit cards, 
department stores will continue to extend credit. 
</P>
<P>
It's also helpful, she said, to go shopping with a friend or a support group 
member -- "someone who can say, 'We're here for one thing only.' And as you go 
through, you can talk about your anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
One of the behavior modification techniques Kreedman recommends for clients is 
that they talk to themselves when they're in a store to remind themselves of 
what they're doing: "I know I've done this before. When I've done this before, 
this is what this means, and therefore I know I really don't need those pair of 
shoes. It's more an indication that I'm feeling unloved." 
</P>
<P>
Wesson emphasized that the compulsive shopper needn't give up shopping 
altogether: "We can't, first of all. We always have to buy, but it has to be 
balanced." 
</P>
<P>
In designing a program to pay off debts, she said, it is also important to 
budget money for recreation or pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who are figuring out a budget put all their 'musts' first: Food 
and rent and the last thing on the list are things that are pleasure, and 
that's why budgets are so impossible to keep to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her book, she said, "is not about quitting shopping as much as it is about 
leading more balanced lives, in which shopping is still a part of life but in 
balance with all the other pleasures of life, and how to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Because most people "don't have 60 or 70 bucks an hour" to go to a therapist, 
Wesson recommends Debtors Anonymous as an effective way to deal with the 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Connie of Anaheim began attending regular Debtors Anonymous meetings two years 
ago. "Things started improving right away because I had support and I didn't 
feel so alone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It took about a year before she got her shopping under control. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to stop, I had to look at my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of her compulsive shopping was "extreme low self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
"I never had children because I thought I was so bad," she said. "I thought I 
didn't deserve children. . . . There were just all kinds of things, and I felt 
everything was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Connie said she is still dealing with her $18,000 debt. "My credit is terrible, 
but I'm making payments now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She admits, however, that she still occasionally gets the urge to splurge. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while I catch myself: 'Oh, I'm being a little panicky today.' But 
now I know I can go to a (D.A.) meeting, or go to the gym and work out. I have 
other things I do today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great because I'm learning to be my best friend, to take care of myself."

A WALK THROUGH OLD SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Couples sneaking a kiss in the Old Courthouse cupola, movie stars drinking tea 
at Mrs. Daniger's Tea Room, and patients waiting at the back porch of Dr. 
Willela Waffle's house were common sights in Santa Ana's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the old buildings in Santa Ana aren't the same. 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse cupola was knocked off in 1933 by an earthquake. Daniger's Tea 
Room closed its doors in 1944 after 10 years of serving the Hollywood elite. 
And Dr. Waffle's house was moved two blocks away to make room for a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the changes, Santa Ana's oldest buildings have weathered the years, 
many of them bearing some of the city's more interesting stories. 
</P>
<P>
"The older buildings are much warmer than the ones being built now. They were 
inviting and not at all intimidating like many of the modern concrete ones that 
go up," said Diann Marsh, vice president of the Santa Ana Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the oldest buildings, like the Old Courthouse on Sycamore Street, are 
also the city's most famous. Architect Charles L. Strange designed the building 
-- with its red sandstone from Arizona and fancy cupola -- to be the tallest 
building south of Los Angeles, said retired court reporter Lecil Slaback, 77, 
whose father was the first permanent court reporter hired by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Strange almost didn't get to build the courthouse because the Board of 
Supervisors twice rejected his design. He prevailed, but only after others 
allegedly conspired to award the contract to another architect. 
</P>
<P>
When the courthouse was half completed, Strange -- true to his name -- 
disappeared, Slaback said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Strange is Santa Ana's own Judge Crater," said Slaback, referring to New 
York Superior Court Judge Joseph Crater, who disappeared in 1930. "He was last 
sighted in Mexico. But everyone who's missing is sighted there." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its odd beginning, Slaback has many memories of the fortress-like 
building, which once housed all the county offices. 
</P>
<P>
As a toddler, Slaback would play after-hours in the courthouse, where his 
parents often worked through the night to type transcripts for the following 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big, mysterious place with shadows like caves. And when I got sleepy, 
my mother would fold up her coat and I would take a nap off in a corner," 
Slaback said. 
</P>
<P>
Slaback's fondest memories of the courthouse were the hundreds of marriages 
that took place. Lovers used to hop on an electric Red Car for less than $1 and 
go from Los Angeles to Santa Ana to be discreetly married. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away from the courthouse on the corner of Bush Street and Civic 
Center Drive was one of Santa Ana's finest Victorian mansions, Dr. Willela 
Howe-Waffle's majestic home. It was built in 1889, the same year that the city 
became the county seat. 
</P>
<P>
As one of Orange County's first female doctors, Waffle practiced medicine out 
of her two-story home. More than 1,000 infants, known as "Waffle babies," were 
delivered by the doctor or her sssistant, Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled Waffle raced across the countryside by horse and buggy to 
visit her patients. Sometimes, patients too sick to wait until morning would 
arrive at her back porch and yell for help through a speaking tube that was 
connected to her bedroom. On hot, summer nights, it was easier to reach the 
doctor because she often slept out on her bedroom balcony. 
</P>
<P>
"She had snow-white, beautiful hair," said Dorothy O'Donnell, whose son and 
daughter were delivered by Waffle. "You didn't have just a doctor with her, she 
was your friend too." Waffle was not one without controversy. She quietly 
divorced her first husband, Dr. Alvin Howe, who was acquitted on a charge of 
performing an abortion, according to an 1890 grand jury report. She married 
Edson Waffle, the socially prominent livery stable owner, who provided her with 
fine horses for her house calls. 
</P>
<P>
Waffle died at the age of 70 after collapsing at the bedside of a patient in 
1924. 
</P>
<P>
Her home, threatened by the construction of a fast-food restaurant parking lot, 
was moved in 1975 to its current location at Sycamore Street and Civic Center 
Drive. Tours of the renovated home are offered the third Saturday of every 
month. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Ana residents wanted a taste of the good life, they strolled 
downtown from 3rd to 5th Street -- the shopping mecca of Orange County. The 
Santora Building on Broadway and 2nd Street -- a grand Spanish-style building 
-- was the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Santora was big and bold with plaster gargoyles glaring from the building's 
upmost facade. On the bottom floor was Daniger's Tea Room, where guests 
lingered over Earl Grey Tea, or descended the building's basement to listen to 
local jazz bands. The Tea Room was listed in Westways magazine as among the top 
places in which to eat in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Among Hollywood's celebrated who signed owner Irene Daniger's guest book were 
Rita Hayworth, Alan Ladd, Rosalind Russell and John Garfield. Stargazers 
shopped in the nearby stores and kept a close eye on the tea room's front door. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana could boast a resident celebrity as well. The ruler of Indore, India, 
wanted to escape the civil unrest in his country, so he moved to peaceful 
Orange County in 1937. The rich maharajah married a nurse from Santa Ana who 
took care of him during an illness, and he built a home -- known as the 
Maharajah's House -- on the 2200 block of Heliotrope Drive for their 4-year-old 
daughter, Marsh said. The house was built without windows on the first floor 
and a gate was on the indoor stairway because he feared his child might be 
kidnaped like the Lindbergh baby. 
</P>
<P>
Before the house was completed, Santa Anans hoped he would create a local 
version of the Taj Mahal. They were disappointed when the prince chose a 
modern-looking house, with giant walls that hid the building from outsiders. 
Curious neighbors did see second-floor windows covered with exotic animal 
skins, Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, who later became a princess in Bombay, attended Hoover Elementary 
School because the maharajah wanted her to grow up with her peers. 
</P>
<P>
As Santa Ana established itself as the county seat, other transplants gradually 
settled in the city after the turn of the century, Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
The up-and-coming people moved into the city's French Park neighborhood, where 
residents tried for years to nickname the area after San Francisco's Nob Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Through the late 1920s, Santa Ana residents favored small bungalows with huge 
porches rather than massive Victorians. The homes were full of the 
arts-and-crafts movement detail such as built-in cabinets and carved tulips in 
the columns. 
</P>
<P>
Two houses, the Alexander and the Thee homes on the 1200 block of French 
Street, represent the era with large porches that were ideal for those who 
wanted to be near their trees and gardens and have a cool place in which to 
sleep during the summer heat waves. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fashionable to be attuned to nature, so residents built all these homes 
that were laid back. It was very Southern California, very Santa Ana," Marsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, "this era has never ended."

What's in store for Angel fans as the team begins its seventh season affected, 
in one way or another, by labor unrest? If history is indicative, it could be a 
long season. In 1985, the last time there were such problems, the team ended up 
just one game out of first. Before that, however, their showing was a good deal 
less stellar. Here's how those labor-troubled seasons compare:

ANGEL DUST SETTLED 
</P>
<P>
Except 1985, when they finished a game out of first place, the Angels have 
played five other seasons marred by strike, boycott or lockout since the 
introduction of divisional play in 1969. They finished an average of more than 
20 games behind the Western Division leaders and only as high as third (at 
that, 26 games behind). In the 15 other seasons since 1969 (during which they 
won three divisional titles), the Halos have finished on average 14 games out 
of first.

About 40 of the brightest high school students from Orange and San Diego 
counties fought a battle of the minds last weekend in a grueling three-hour 
competition designed to test their knowledge of American history, geography and 
current events. 
</P>
<P>
The students, taking part in the second annual California Citizen Bee 
competitions, had to correctly answer a series of questions on such topics to 
test their academic acumen. 
</P>
<P>
Tung Phan, 16, a junior at Kennedy High School in La Palma, and Dennis Ulrich, 
18, a senior at Mission Viejo High, won first-place honors in Region E, which 
covers Orange and San Diego counties. They were each awarded $500 and will 
represent their region in a statewide competition this month. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of the statewide competition will receive cash awards of $3,000, 
$2,000 and $1,000 for first, second and third place, respectively. The winners 
will also represent California in the national competition in Washington in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing in second place, Mayumi Negishi, a senior at El Toro High and Mark 
Coldrup, a senior at Mission Viejo High; in third place, Tri Nguyen, a junior 
at Saddleback High, and Dierk Meierbachtol, Gompers Secondary in San Diego.

SINGLE LIFE: GOVERNMENT AWAKENS TO COST OF MARITAL-STATUS DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consumer task force -- the brainchild of Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn 
-- was convened for the purpose of determining if, and in what ways, single 
people suffer discrimination as compared to married people. 
</P>
<P>
How ingenious. 
</P>
<P>
But the study was bound to happen, given the fact that unmarried people compose 
55% of the population in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A 126-page report was released last month by Thomas F. Coleman, chairman of the 
Consumer Task Force on Marital Status Discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
It revealed what I had long known: Singles' are indeed penalized for not 
committing matrimony. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said, the "report represents the emergence of a new dimension of the 
consumer protection movement. Call it singles' rights." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many committee members, ancillary staff and taxpayer dollars it 
took to screw in this light bulb. They could have saved time and money by 
simply phoning me. For the price of a lunch at the Ritz I could have told them 
a thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage is still considered an achievement in our society, especially for 
women. A woman's social status is elevated by virtue of taking on a man's last 
name. And a man, if he really expects to hit corporate heights, must have the 
obligatory family portrait atop his mahogany desk or be prepared to have his 
masculinity quotient questioned behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
Try calling the Auto Club for a membership. If you and your significant other 
are living together it will cost each of you $51 a year. If you are married, it 
will cost $51 for the "primary" member and $14 for the "secondary" member. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies discriminate against singles. Many of them refuse to write 
home renters' insurance for a single person. Two insurance company 
representatives told me that they no longer insure single people. "Single 
people have a tendency to have a lot of people running in and out of their 
homes," the insurance agent said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't," I protested. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am sure you're responsible, but we see so much theft from boyfriends 
and girlfriends coming and going, it just doesn't make sense for us to write 
these policies." 
</P>
<P>
I was finally permitted the luxury of purchasing such a protective policy but 
was forced to sign an affidavit assuring them I lived alone. Adding insult to 
injury, I was actually required to furnish a list of names of anyone who might 
visit me for 24 hours or longer. 
</P>
<P>
Auto insurance wasn't any easier: Two prior moving violations -- five years ago 
-- and one accident in 1984 -- that was not my fault -- made it difficult to 
find an insurance company that would accept me. The reason given? I am a single 
self-employed person who works at home. They politely suggested that I put 
myself in someone else's good hands. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes? Don't get me started. A married couple are allowed a renters' tax break 
of $131 contrasted with $61 for a single person. As a single person the 
equitable break should be $65.50. 
</P>
<P>
Single people without kids pay more than their fair share. Parents with 
children receive a tax break and their kids use the school system and 
government sponsored day care (where available). 
</P>
<P>
Airlines restrict frequent-flier awards to married partners or blood relatives. 
TWA recently dropped the spouse-only policy, but most airlines are 
single-minded on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
Join a health club as a single person. If you and your fiance live together and 
work out together, or if you are single and work out alone, it will cost you 
about twice as much for a membership in most health clubs as it would if you 
were married. 
</P>
<P>
Travel clubs all over Southern California assist singles' in locating other 
single people with whom to travel to save members money on mandatory 
double-occupancy fees. An estimated 300,000 members of such travel clubs abound 
in the United States today as contrasted with only 10,000 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
People may exclaim: "But it's against the law to discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
It is. But those who choose to discriminate will always find a way. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting that Los Angeles "has taken a very positive first step," Virginia M. 
Apuzzo, deputy executive director of New York state's consumer protection 
agency, vowed to mount a strong campaign against marital-status discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"People are not being treated fairly in the marketplace," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. has responded to the marital-status issue. 
Long-held membership policies dictated that admission was only for the member 
and "spouse." Bowing to public pressure, the association recently relaxed the 
policy, allowing members and any adult guest to be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Doolittle would be proud.

The Medellin drug trafficking cartel released Sen. Federico Estrada Velez in 
Medellin two days after his abduction and the government reiterated its vow to 
continue fighting cartel violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad to be back home, to be with my family," the Liberal Party 
senator said after being released unharmed Thursday in northern Medellin, where 
he took a taxi to his home. Estrada Velez said he was treated well and that he 
expected drug traffickers to issue a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, drug traffickers took responsibility for the kidnaping and 
threatened to kill him unless officials freed two cartel suspects, but the 
government said the two were not in custody.

LAFOLLETTE AIDE WINS BALLOT TIFF

<P>
A Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled today that state Assembly candidate 
Robert G. Wilcox can describe himself as an "assembly member's legislative 
representative" on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox's ballot designation was disputed by an opponent, Paula Boland, who 
filed suit Thursday to force state election officials to reject the phrase as 
an overstatement of Wilcox's credentials. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Michael J. Virga denied Boland's request that he order the Secretary 
of State's office to reject Wilcox's ballot identification. Virga ruled that 
the description was not misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, a former field representative for retiring Assemblywoman Marian W. La 
Follette (R-Northridge), is on leave from his post as executive director of a 
La Follette task force on breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
Wilcox and Boland are seeking the Republican nomination for La Follette's seat 
in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Boland contended in court documents that Wilcox's ballot description "falsely 
creates the impression that Mr. Wilcox has a higher, more responsible position 
than his actual status" and implies that he "has some form of incumbency 
status." The judge was not persuaded. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox has maintained that the description accurately characterizes his past 
duties for La Follette. He chose the identification after abandoning an earlier 
phrase, "Assembly executive director," which state officials last month 
challenged him to substantiate.

UAL OKS EMPLOYEE BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
$4.2-BILLION DEAL STEMS PROXY FIGHT 
</P>

<P>
UAL Corp. directors announced today that they have agreed to sell United 
Airlines to its employees in a $4.2-billion deal that would create the nation's 
largest employee-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was struck in round-the-clock negotiations between the UAL board 
and a group the employee unions set up to stage a buyout, United Employee 
Acquisition Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The move heads off a threatened proxy fight with the parent company's largest 
shareholder but puts UAL back in a familiar position -- floating a deal with 
uncertain financing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, worth $201 a share, employees will exchange $155 in cash, 
$35 in UAL notes and an estimated $11 worth of securities in UAL subsidiary 
Covia Corp. for each UAL share. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on how the deal was to be financed. A source close 
to the negotiations told Associated Press that the parties had no firm 
financing for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
UAL, parent of United Airlines, said it expects to conclude a final agreement 
promptly. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today in New York, representatives of the unions said the 
agreement calls for employees to give up $2 billion in concessions over five 
years, including $300 million in the first year and $500 million in the fifth 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of ownership in the new company would be as follows: pilots 
owning about 37.9%; machinists owning about 35.7%, non-union employees about 
14.3% and flight attendants about 12%, the unions said. 
</P>
<P>
Machinists' union Vice President John Peterpaul predicted that banks would look 
favorably on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, immediately called off its 
threatened proxy fight to oust the company's board at the April 26 annual 
shareholder meeting. Coniston holds an 11.8% stake. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement met with a lukewarm reaction, however, from some analysts, who 
questioned whether banks would be willing to back the bid without a strong 
management group behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf has been in doubt because of union 
indications made before today that they would dump Wolf in the event of an 
employee buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots union head Frederick Dubinsky said in New York today that Wolf would be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our intention to put together a top-notch senior management team . . . 
and that will include a new (chief executive officer)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's stock opened up $3.50 a share at $169 on the New York Stock Exchange but 
by midday had slid back to $165.50, unchanged from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement marks another chapter in a takeover saga that began in August 
when Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis made a $5.4-billion offer for the 
company. Davis said earlier this week he would not make another bid. 
</P>
<P>
But his initial offer sent United's pilots and management scrambling to come up 
with their own bid. In September, UAL directors accepted a $6.75-billion offer 
from the pilots, management and British Airways PLC that also included labor 
and wage concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was killed after the would-be purchasers were unable to line up 
enough financing.

Soviet border guards today refused Sen. Alfonse D'Amato entry into Lithuania, 
which has been locked in a war of wills with the Kremlin since the Baltic 
republic declared independence. 
</P>
<P>
After being turned away at the small border crossing in northeast Poland, 
D'Amato denounced what he called the Soviet Union's "psychological warfare" on 
Lithuania, whose Parliament approved the independence declaration March 11. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato wanted to enter Lithuania on a Lithuanian visa to demonstrate what he 
called Congress' solidarity with the republic. Instead, the New York 
Republican, who was invited to the capital of Vilnius by Lithuanian President 
Vytautas Landsbergis, was instructed to apply for a Soviet visa at a consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner the United States wakes up to what is taking place and becomes 
realistic, the better," D'Amato told reporters at the border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gorbachev says one thing and does another. He talks about freedom and yet 
denies access to a free country. That is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato flew to Poland on Thursday, planning to challenge the Soviet land 
blockade of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Lithuania's foreign minister, Algrinas Saudragis, D'Amato and a 
half dozen aides traveled by chartered bus the 200 miles from Warsaw to 
Ogrodniki, Lithuania's only direct border opening to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived at the crossing on a country road around 2 p.m. today, and Polish 
soldiers let them pass the first barrier on the Polish side. But another 100 
yards down the road they came to a red-and-white barrier marking the Lithuanian 
frontier and guarded by Soviet KGB troops. 
</P>
<P>
Through an interpreter speaking Lithuanian, D'Amato asked Soviet Maj. Vitas 
Buchis for permission to enter the country. Buchis, a native Lithuanian serving 
in the Soviet border force, said he had to check by telephone with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
After returning, Buchis told D'Amato that passage was forbidden. "I am sorry 
but rules are rules. I am just following orders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudragis then crossed into Lithuania alone. 
</P>
<P>
Extending his arm to D'Amato's across the frontier, Saudragis said: "We shake 
hands over this border that divides us. But your support is strengthening our 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the United States for never recognizing the forced 
incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government since Tuesday has closed the Ogrodniki crossing to most 
traffic, permitting only Polish and Soviet citizens to use it to return home. 
</P>
<P>
Even in normal times, citizens of other countries are not allowed to pass the 
pair of wooden gates on the narrow rural road.

Pope John Paul II met today with PLO leader Yasser Arafat and urged him to 
pursue peace talks with Israel. Israel criticized the meeting and said it was 
"mystified" at the reception Arafat received. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pontiff met with Arafat to encourage 
"any positive attitude in the search for peace, and especially to strengthen 
the will for dialogue as the only valid way to find adequate solutions for 
conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in a green military uniform and black-and-white headdress, met the Pope 
for 20 minutes in the papal library. During the private talks, John Paul 
reiterated that the Palestinians, as well as the Jews, have the right to a 
homeland, the papal spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy condemned Arafat's reception in Italy and at the Vatican, 
saying it was "mystified" the Palestine Liberation Organization leader was 
treated as a "man of peace." Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization 
and refuses to negotiate with it.

TEXAS ATTY. GEN. FLATLY DENIES CHARGES OF MARIJUANA IN 1970S

Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox, who has been harassing his Democratic runoff opponent 
with claims she used drugs, today flatly denied claims by two men that they saw 
him smoking marijuana in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox, the attorney general, vigorously denied reports today in Dallas and 
Houston newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell them that they are liars to their faces," he said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox has criticized election opponent Ann Richards for refusing to answer yes 
or no when asked if she ever used an illegal drug, and has accused her of 
smoking marijuana in the 1970s. He said he is willing to take a lie detector 
test to dispute the allegations about him. 
</P>
<P>
"I will," he said. "And I want you to get Ms. Richards strapped in beside me 
when we do it." 
</P>
<P>
Houston lawyer Jim Sharp and former Dallas Police Officer Edward H. Lowe signed 
affidavits that they saw Mattox smoke marijuana on separate occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe said he saw Mattox smoke marijuana in a Dallas apartment during an 
undercover investigation in the early 1970s, when Mattox was a Dallas lawyer. 
He said he didn't arrest Mattox because he was investigating a separate matter. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp said Mattox and he shared a marijuana cigarette in 1974 while in a car 
after the Democratic state convention in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never used any marijuana or dangerous drugs, period," Mattox said about 
the accusations, which Sharp and Lowe made in the Houston Chronicle and the 
Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents the two men described "absolutely did not take place," Mattox 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The drug use issue first was presented at a debate before the March 13 primary. 
Mattox and former Gov. Mark White denied ever using illegal drugs, but 
Richards, the state treasurer, refused to answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, a recovering alcoholic, later said she has not had an alcoholic drink 
or a mood-altering chemical since leaving an alcohol recovery program in 1980.

Afghan rebels purportedly surrendering to officials of the Moscow-backed 
government opened fire during a ceremony today in western Afghanistan, killing 
at least five senior military officers, the British Broadcasting Corp. 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A BBC correspondent recorded the intense sounds of automatic weapons fire used 
during the 15-minute attack in Herat, a city near Afghanistan's Iranian border, 
400 miles west of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter said the incident occurred when the provincial governor moved to 
embrace a guerrilla commander, who had apparently voiced his intention to 
surrender with his fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting broke out, prompting a crowd of diplomats, reporters and various 
dignitaries to duck for cover. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter said the governor is in critical condition and "a large number" of 
other officials and some civilians are dead.

WALL STREET ARBITRAGERS FOUND GUILTY OF INSIDER TRADING, FRAUD

A federal jury today convicted two Wall Street arbitragers on insider trading, 
fraud and other counts linked to the so-called "Yuppie Five" scandal, capping a 
12-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Teicher, 38, who headed the arbitrage firm Teicher &amp; Co., faces a 
maximum 60-year prison term and fines that could total $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Teicher's firm faces a $500,000 fine, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl H. 
Loewenson. 
</P>
<P>
Also convicted was Ross Frankel, 33, former head of arbitrage research at 
now-defunct investment house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He could receive as 
much as 30 years in jail and a $1.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict ends five days of jury deliberations over a case stemming from the 
"Yuppie Five" insider trading case. Four young Wall Street professionals and a 
client pleaded guilty in 1986 to making illegal stock trades based on inside 
information about corporate takeovers that they had obtained through their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Teicher and Frankel were convicted of trading the stocks of eight corporations 
based on stolen information. Loewenson said he did not have a figure for the 
total profits reaped from their trades.

The head of West Germany's powerful central bank said today that German 
economic unification need not lead to a surge in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, speaking on the eve of international 
monetary talks, gave a clear warning to Bonn politicians that rate fears will 
subside only if East and West German marks were swapped at a rate that makes 
economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
"If we set a solid and economically sensible framework for this unification 
process which does not endanger price stability in West Germany, the fears of a 
further rise in interest rates are unfounded," Poehl told journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Poehl's remarks after Franco-German economic talks appeared calculated to calm 
nervous financial markets ahead of Saturday's meeting here of the Group of 
Seven industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada.

Champion Spark Plug will consolidate its U.S. manufacturing operations by 
closing two plants, company officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Plants in Toledo and Detroit will be integrated over the next two years into 
the company's Burlington, Iowa, and Cambridge, Ohio, facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the company and United Auto Workers union to meet regarding the 
timing and effects of the consolidation on production and maintenance 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
There now are 245 salaried and hourly workers at Detroit and 430 in Toledo 
whose jobs would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said new jobs in Burlington and Cambridge would be created as 
a result of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely regret the impact this announcement would have on employees in 
Detroit and Toledo and on the two cities," said Jerry Godwin, Champion 
president. "Champion has been struggling for several years with an overcapacity 
of production facilities, while at the same time selling a product -- spark 
plugs -- whose overall market has declined."

Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed broadly higher today as the key 
Nikkei Average shot up more than 1,000 points on bargain hunting, a stronger 
yen and news of an agreement in U.S.-Japanese trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Nikkei average of 225 selected shares, which lost 193.88 points 
Thursday and has dropped more than 25% since Jan. 1, catapulted 1,029.72 
points, or 3.6%, to end the week at 29,278.78. 
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Exchange Price Index surged 90.44 points to 
2,149.26. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bargain hunters took advantage of low prices and there was a 
renewed sense of confidence in the Japanese yen as a result of the agreement 
between Japanese and U.S. negotiators in Washington on steps to reduce the U.S. 
trade deficit with Japan.

Supporters and opponents of an exhibit of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's 
sexually graphic photographs rallied today outside a courthouse where a judge 
heard pleas to protect the show from censorship. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 supporters marched about 10 blocks through downtown, ending at the 
steps of the Hamilton County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
They were met by about 100 people protesting tonight's scheduled opening of the 
exhibit. Police kept the two sides apart. 
</P>
<P>
The supporters chanted for freedom of expression and carried a banner that 
read: "If You Give Artists Freedom of Expression, Soon Every American Will Want 
It." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents carried signs that read, "We Want Decency in Cincinnati" and "Calling 
Pornography Art Does Not Make It So." 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporary Arts Center asked a Hamilton County municipal judge to prevent 
local authorities from filing criminal charges or taking any other action 
involving photographs showing sexual or sadomasochistic acts. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 museum members were expected to attend a special preview 
tonight. The exhibit is scheduled to open to the public Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials asked Judge Edward Donnellon to dismiss a lawsuit by 
the museum, which wanted a jury to decide whether the photographs violated 
local obscenity laws. Dismissal of the lawsuit would allow authorities to 
intervene.

PATTY HEARST ENJOYS NEW ROLE AS ONE OF 'ODD PEOPLE' IN 'CRY-BABY'

<P>
When John Waters approached Patricia Hearst Shaw two years ago at the Cannes 
Film Festival to be in his next movie, she thought it was a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Then the script for "Cry-Baby" arrived in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Oh, no, he was serious,' " said Hearst, who was recently in 
Baltimore promoting the film, whose credits simply refer to her by her 
well-known maiden name. In the film, she has a small part as a street-crossing 
guard who is the wife of a school bus driver, played by David Nelson, and the 
mother of a juvenile delinquent, played by former teen porno star Traci Lords. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he cast odd people," said Hearst, who lives in Westport, Conn., with 
her husband, Bernard Shaw, an executive with the Hearst Corp., and two 
daughters, Gillian and Lydia. "And I loved 'Hairspray.' So I read the script, 
and I thought it was really funny, and I thought it would be a lot of fun to 
do. It's not like being asked to be in 'Halloween.' I wouldn't even think about 
that. But to be in one of John's movies, it was like, 'Wow, OK.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance to do something totally different that maybe would surprise 
people. (It would be) something really silly, and I thought it would be neat." 
</P>
<P>
Hearst describes her meeting with Waters after he sent her the script. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized I was in big trouble because there were all these people, like the 
casting director and the producers, on a sofa, and there's all these pictures 
of actors and actresses scattered all over the floor," she said, "and I 
thought, 'Uh-oh. This is like a casting call.' 
</P>
<P>
"So we talk, and he says, 'You look too young. I don't know how we're going to 
make you look older.' And I'm thinking, 'I saw "Little Big Man." I know what 
they can do to make me look older.' So I say, 'Oh, well, thank you.' 
</P>
<P>
"And then (Waters) says, 'Can you read for me?' And I go, 'Huh?' because I read 
this thing like once. I just didn't think this was what I was going to be 
doing. And so I do a horrible, horrible reading and walk out thinking, 'Well, 
there's just no way.' And two days later, they call me and say I got the part." 
</P>
<P>
Arriving on the set in Baltimore was strange at first. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see (the other actors) looking like, 'Jeez, can you believe he hired 
somebody who doesn't know anything about this?' They were worried because it's 
their careers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Waters: "I think she probably had fun. It was like going to a different 
world -- a safe, different world, a different world that ended her up in Vanity 
Fair." 
</P>
<P>
Did she think she would be exposing herself to a press that would be dredging 
up her past again? 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know what could possibly be dredged up anymore that hasn't been," 
said the San Francisco newspaper family heiress. "There seems to be enough 
other things to talk about. I don't know; I'm not that worried about it. I know 
I'm tired of it. It's been 15 years, and I've moved on, and to me, it's just 
old news." 
</P>
<P>
The "old news" started in February, 1974, when the then-19-year-old student was 
kidnaped from her Berkeley apartment by members of the Symbionese Liberation 
Army, a revolutionary group that held her hostage. Two months later, she 
announced in a taped message that she had repudiated her former life, joined 
her captives in their political struggle and had taken the name Tania. She 
later participated in a bank robbery and a shoot-out at a sporting goods store. 
</P>
<P>
After going underground for 1 1/2 years, she was arrested, put on trial, 
convicted of bank robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony 
and sentenced to seven years in prison. In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter 
commuted her sentence after she had served 23 months in a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a bad lawyer (F. Lee Bailey)," said Waters, who attended her trial in 
1976 as a fan of criminal trials. "He made her plead the Fifth Amendment, which 
always makes you look guilty. Even I could have gotten her off."

Sandy Lyle of Britain hit almost as many spectators as greens in this week's 
Masters golf championship. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 winner struck spectators on different holes over the front nine in 
struggling to a 74 at the Augusta National course today; he hit one member of 
the gallery during Thursday's opening round, when he slumped to a 77. 
</P>
<P>
Two of his victims, a restaurant owner from Augusta and a woman from Florida, 
required hospital treatment after being hit in the head by Lyle's errant shots. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant owner was momentarily stunned when he was struck near his ear by 
Lyle's tee shot on the eighth hole Thursday. He was taken to a local hospital 
and later released. 
</P>
<P>
The shot did not hurt Lyle, the 1985 British Open champion, who birdied that 
535-yard par-five hole. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida woman was struck flush in the face by Lyle's drive today at the 
555-yard second hole. The ball broke her spectacles and cut her face, causing 
her to bleed profusely. 
</P>
<P>
She, too, was taken to the hospital and was X-rayed for a possible fracture of 
the cheek bone. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had reports that she is OK," Lyle told reporters after his round of 74, 
which put him at 151 and caused him to miss the cut in the Masters for the 
first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to walk in," an obviously disgusted Lyle said later. "I didn't 
need any more of that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Lyle, who has been struggling with his game recently, did get more of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
On the 435-yard fifth hole he hooked his approach shot into the gallery near 
the green, striking a woman on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
She was not hurt, and the ball bounced onto the green to save Lyle's par. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the long-hitting Scot reached the tee of the 180-yard sixth hole, 
word of his wildness apparently had spread. 
</P>
<P>
When his tee shot sailed over the green of the par-three hole, the crowd was 
ready. They scattered quickly and Lyle recorded only a near-miss. He bogeyed 
that hole.

Huston, who birdied the second hole. 
</P>
<P>
Both are first-timers in this event, the first major championship of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Huston shot a 66 on the 6,905-yard Augusta National course on Thursday, a day 
when Masters rookies occupied three of the top four places. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jacobsen, in the Masters for the seventh time, had a 67 and Bill Britton, 
the other rookie, had a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jacobsen and Britton parred their first two holes today as the leaders 
began play under overcast skies. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature was in the 70s and there was a 30% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Three others had 3-under-par totals in the early stages of the round that will 
serve as the halfway cut for the low 44 scorers and ties and anyone within 10 
shots of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange, winner of the last two U.S. Opens, PGA champion Payne Stewart 
and 1985 Masters champion Bernhard Langer of West Germany all had 3-under 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's figure was through six holes today, Langer four and Strange three. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Jumbo Ozaki birdied two of the first three holes to get to 4-under, but 
then bogeyed the next two. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman, one of the pretournament favorites, was in danger of missing the 
36-hole cut after a 72-150. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sluman shot a 68 and Steve Jones a 69, leaving both with 146 totals. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino got in shape to survive the cut with a 69-147, playing in the 
twosome with Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland's Sandy Lyle missed the cut two years after winning the championship. 
He shot a 74 for 151. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, who helped create the popularity of golf and the Masters in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s, also missed the cut for the seventh year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, a three-time champion, birdied two of the first four holes but couldn't 
keep it going. He finished at 80-156. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger, winner of the season-opening Tournament of Champions, had a 
76-156.

<P>
Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg suffered a defeat in court today when 
he was ordered to pay creditors of his failed business empire between $1.65 
million and $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stockholm District Court said that an earlier agreement by the former tennis 
ace to pay his Swedish creditors was valid and that half the payments must be 
completed by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Borg, 33, disputes the exact amount owed to creditors of Bjorn Borg Invest AB, 
maintaining that some transactions were carried out without his permission. But 
a court-appointed liquidator said today that the two sides agreed that at least 
$1.65 million is Borg's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Since quitting the professional tennis circuit at 27, Borg built up an 
exclusive design and fashion retail business with a holding company in the tax 
haven of Jersey, but the group went into liquidation last year.

Olympic star and world record holder Florence Griffith Joyner is expecting her 
first child in the fall, her business manager said today. "She is expecting 
some time in early November," Gordon Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Baskin said Griffith Joyner, popularly known as "FloJo," is delighted with the 
news. "This is something she has hoped for for some time," Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, 30, set world records in the women's 100 and 200 meters in 
1988 while attracting worldwide attention with her colorful outfits. She won 
three gold medals and a silver at the Seoul Olympics and announced her 
retirement from the sport last year. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband is Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple-jump gold medalist who has 
turned his attention to the 110-meter high hurdles in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's even more excited than Florence," Baskin said.

BASEBALL PREVIEW AL EAST; 
</P>
<P>
SAME TACTICS, SAME FACES, COULD ADD UP TO TOO MUCH OF SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least the American League East produced baseball's only pennant race last 
season. That's about all this declining division did. While the West was 
aggressive in raising young players, the East grew lazy and seemed content to 
occasionally pick up an old free agent or two. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the balance in the league tilting the other way, the AL East is -- 
why, why? -- still doing the same thing. Keith Hernandez, Jeff Reardon and Tony 
Pena were All-Stars once, but not these days. The one team that followed the 
West formula was Baltimore, and that was out of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto probably has the best team. Milwaukee should contend, while Baltimore 
and Boston might slide. New York is middle-of-the-pack, followed by Cleveland 
and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto Blue Jays 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays finally found the right manager and the right ballpark. Spurred 
by sellouts and Cito Gaston, Toronto recovered from a 12-24 start and outlasted 
Baltimore in the stretch. This year, the Blue Jays could draw 4 million at the 
SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (17-8) heads a staff that led the division with a 3.58 earned-run 
average. Tom Henke (8-3, 1.92 ERA, 20 saves, 148 strikeouts in 151 innings) is 
the closer in a bullpen full of decent middle-relief and set-up men. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell, at 30, is the last remaining member of what was once projected as 
baseball's best outfield. He can poke (.297, 18 home runs, 104 RBIs). Fred 
McGriff's 36 homers led the league and Kelly Gruber (.290, 18 HR) is solid. 
Mookie Wilson (.298, 12 stolen bases in two months) became the rage in Canada; 
at 34, he can still play, provided Junior Felix (46 RBIs in a platoon role) 
doesn't keep him out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Watch rookie John Olerud. He has recovered from a brain aneurysm and scouts say 
he can really hit. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Brewers 
</P>
<P>
Free agent Dave Parker brings his bat to an offense that always comes down to 
Robin Yount and Paul Molitor. But can the Brewers solve their two omnipresent 
problems -- injuries and fielding? 
</P>
<P>
Yount (.318, 21 HR, 103 RBI) beat out Ruben Sierra for the MVP award and 
continued his march toward 3,000 hits. At age 34, he should get there next 
season and after that, maybe 4,000? 
</P>
<P>
Molitor (.315, 27 SB) and Parker (97 RBIs for Oakland) are good. So could be 
rookie outfielder Greg Vaughn (26 HR, 92 RBIs in 110 games at Class AAA 
Denver). 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bosio was by far Milwaukee's best starter. He was 15-10 with a 2.95 ERA 
and was the only AL East pitcher among the league's top nine ERA leaders. Dan 
Plesac (2.35 ERA, 33 saves) is outstanding and he kills left handers. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers ruined themselves with a league-leading 155 errors. They made 33 
miscues at shortstop and an awful 28 errors in the outfield. Furthermore, their 
players always seem to be hurt. Jim Gantner and Dale Sveum are hoping to 
recover this season. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Orioles 
</P>
<P>
From the minute they rallied to beat Roger Clemens on opening day, it was a 
special season in Baltimore. The Orioles tied the 1967 Chicago Cubs for most 
victories (87) after a 100-loss season and showed the fourth-greatest 
improvement in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
A wild pitch from brilliant rookie reliever Gregg Olson in Toronto on the final 
weekend stalled Baltimore's bid to go from worst-to-first. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles project great things for Ben McDonald, the No. 1 pick in last 
year's draft. Olson (1.69 ERA, 27 saves) did not blow an opportunity until late 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken's streak might be taking its toll. He hit 21 homers and drove in 93 
runs, but his slugging percentage declined for the sixth straight year. Ripken 
is more than halfway to Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, the Orioles showed the value of catching the ball. They set 
a major-league record with a .996 fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Red Sox 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox went out and bought some of everything -- Shane Rawley to start, 
Jeff Reardon to relieve, Tony Pena to catch. Maybe those are improvements, 
maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Clemens (17-11, 3.13) is the only sure thing in the rotation. Reardon (31 
saves despite a 4.07 ERA) joins Lee Smith (25 saves, 3.57 ERA) and gives Boston 
too much of the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs (.330, .430 on-base average) reached 200 hits for the seventh 
straight season. This year, there's no controversy, either. Dwight Evans (20 
HR, 100 RBIs) is great at 39 and Mike Greenwell (.308, 95 RBIs) and Ellis Burks 
(.303, 21 SB) helped Boston lead the majors with a .277 average and 774 runs. 
The Red Sox will really miss Nick Esasky (30 HR, 108 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankees 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees led the majors in victories during the 1980s, even though it was 
the first decade since Ruth &amp; Gehrig in which they did not win a World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield is the big question. If he can stay healthy and regain his form, 
it's a major plus. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly (.303, 23 HR, 113 RBIs) again rebounded from his characteristic 
slow start. He might do even better this year if he works out a new contract 
with George Steinbrenner. Steve Sax (.315, 43 SB) was a free agent who turned 
out well. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got hooted when they signed Pascual Perez to be their ace. But look 
at his numbers -- 28-21 with a 2.80 ERA in his last three years. Andy Hawkins 
(15-15), Chuck Cary (4-4) Clay Parker (4-5) and newcomer Tim Leary (8-14 in 
Cincinnati and Los Angeles) fill out a garden variety rotation. 
</P>
<P>
New York's 4.50 ERA was second-worst to Detroit in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Indians 
</P>
<P>
The Indians have not finished within 10 games of first place since 1959. This 
year, there's optimism in Cleveland, but is it justified? 
</P>
<P>
The Indians got catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., the minor league player of the year, 
plus promising Carlos Baerga and usable Chris James from San Diego for Joe 
Carter (35 HR, 105 RBIs). Probably not that bad a deal, considering Carter 
would have left after this season as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Candiotti (13-10, 3.10 ERA), John Farrell (9-14) and Greg Swindell (13-6, 
3.37 ERA) can form the nucleus of a nice rotation for new Manager John McNamara 
if they're healthy and consistent. Doug Jones (32 saves) and Jesse Orosco (2.08 
ERA in 69 games) give the Indians a decent lefty-righty bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians hope free agent Keith Hernandez, 36, can help on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Tigers 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers were so bad last season that even eternal optimist Sparky Anderson 
had to take some time off. There's no reason to think Detroit will be much 
better this year. 
</P>
<P>
Free agents Lloyd Moseby (.221 in Toronto), Tony Phillips (.262 in Oakland) and 
Cecil Fielder, who returned from Japan, join Larry Sheets as newcomers. That's 
the best Detroit could do. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Trammell slumped to .243 and Lou Whitaker hit just .251. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Morris, the top winner in the 1980s, fell to 6-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers slid from 88-74 in 1988 to 59-103 last year, their first 100-loss 
season since 1975.

HAS SURGERY HELPED RHYTHM'S RUN?

<P>
A year ago, the questions posed to the 3-year-old colt that Shug McGaughey 
steered through Queens, N.Y., en route to Kentucky were: "How fast? How far?" 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer replied emphatically, running a mile in 1:32 2/5, the fastest eight 
furlongs ever run by a 3-year-old and the second fastest by a thoroughbred of 
any age, while winning the Gotham Stakes and propelling himself toward 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
The question to which McGaughey seeks an answer Saturday at Aqueduct, where he 
will send Ogden Mills Phipps' Rhythm into the $250,000 Gotham, is more 
puzzling. Simply: "How?" 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, in McGaughey's words, didn't have a straw in his path between 
Florida and Churchill Downs. Rhythm's route to Kentucky has been riddled with 
potholes. 
</P>
<P>
"Things went exactly as planned last year," McGaughey said. "Nothing got in the 
way except not winning (the Derby) once we got there. Things this year haven't 
gone that smoothly. Maybe everything will come together on the right day this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
To this point, 1990 has been unkind to Rhythm. In 1989, the colt by Mr. 
Prospector and Dance Number easily won two races before being beaten in a photo 
by stablemate Adjudicating in the Grade I Champagne. He then won the Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile at 1-1/16 miles. But he was quite dull, if not indifferent, in 
February, when he returned in the Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream, finishing 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm's subsequent effort in the Fountain of Youth was improved. Although he 
finished 10th, he was in touch with the pace while under restraint and began a 
move into contention before stopping abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
Rider Craig Perret reported hearing deep gurgling noises coming from Rhythm's 
throat as his breathing became labored. A veterinarian, Dr. James Robertson, 
was summoned from Ohio State University to the Phipps' barn at Gulfstream and 
determined that the colt suffered from a displaced palate, and a muscle in 
Rhythm's throat was cut in a 20-minute surgery. "The success rate is 50% to 
60%," McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Rhythm's recovery has progressed smoothly. "He's trained well," 
McGaughey said from Gulfstream, where he will run yet another Phipps 
3-year-old, Private Game, in the Preview Stakes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"And there have been no noises coming from his throat. Robertson said he's seen 
horses with displaced palates that were caused by fighting a (tiring) race 
track. I'd like to think maybe that had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm, provided his repairs withstand the stress of racing, must run well in 
the Gotham if he is to remain among the first rank of Kentucky Derby 
contenders. If he does, he will recapture most of his preseason stature. 
</P>
<P>
He drew the No. 1 post in a field of 11 entered Thursday. The others in order 
of post position: For Really, Kentucky Jazz, Le Prince, Thirty Six Red, Senor 
Pete, Burnt Hills, Paradise Found, Lo Bucker, Richard R. and Cielo. Burnt 
Hills, a Bobby Frankel-trained, California-based shipper making his first 
effort beyond six furlongs, is the overnight favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Most Gotham starters have something to prove, only Rhythm has something to 
rediscover. Said McGaughey: "We'll find out a lot about him on Saturday."
