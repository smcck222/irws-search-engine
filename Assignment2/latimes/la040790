URBAN LEAGUE SUES FORMER PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: BLACK SERVICE GROUP ALLEGES HERB CAWTHORNE SPENT $13,000 ON SUCH 
PERSONAL ITEMS AS DENTAL WORK AND A PAINTING.

<P>
The San Diego Urban League, claiming "fraud and deceit" by former President 
Herb Cawthorne, sued him Friday to recoup more than $13,000 in league funds 
that Cawthorne allegedly diverted for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court lawsuit accuses Cawthorne of spending Urban League money on 
airline tickets, hotels, meals, auto expenses, dental work and a $1,395 
painting. The black service group also charges Cawthorne with giving away at 
least one of two Super Bowl tickets purchased with $2,400 of the organization's 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is the first official explanation of the charges that led to 
Cawthorne's sudden resignation from the Urban League on June 7, leaving behind 
a position that had made him perhaps the city's most visible black leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Mr. Cawthorne's resignation in June, 1989, the Board of Directors has 
attempted to resolve this matter in a confidential fashion consistent with 
traditional personnel procedures," Urban League Chairwoman Deborah Brady-Davis 
said in a news release. "Repeated attempts to seek a negotiated settlement with 
Mr. Cawthorne have been unsuccessful. Consequently, the Board of Directors 
voted (in January) to initiate this legal proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne's attorney, Robert Baxley, said: "I'm making no comment until I see 
the lawsuit. I think you'll find our position will come out relatively soon in 
the public domain, and, when that happens, everybody will know it." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Baxley confirmed that the Urban League had demanded repayment of an 
unspecified sum of money and added that he and Cawthorne "don't believe it's 
owed." 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne, who has maintained silence on the matter since he stepped down in 
June, did not return a telephone call to his office at the Black Federation of 
San Diego, where he is now chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
But Urban League officials broke their silences with the filing of the lawsuit 
Friday. Former board chairwoman Patricia McQuater revealed that, to this day, 
she does not know the original source of the information that caused her to 
launch an audit of Cawthorne's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
McQuater said she received a telephone call on Palm Sunday, 1989, from a "very 
credible" source, who passed on complaints of financial irregularities against 
Cawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt rather confident that there was nothing to it, but I felt that the 
prudent thing to do was to investigate," McQuater said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But, as auditors began digging into Cawthorne's records, they uncovered 
numerous financial irregularities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the auditors came back, there would be something else, and it just 
got sickening," McQuater said. "It got to the point where there were more than 
just one or two little things." 
</P>
<P>
A three-member committee of Urban League directors overseeing the audit decided 
to confront Cawthorne at a June 7 meeting. But Cawthorne declined to speak to 
the group, and, an hour later, resigned in tears before the full board, 
McQuater said. 
</P>
<P>
"No questions were answered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-page complaint against Cawthorne seeks more than $25,000 in general 
damages, more than $22,000 in "special damages" and unspecified punitive 
damages. It demands repayment of the $13,000 plus interest and claims that 
Cawthorne's actions cost the Urban League the expense of a special audit of 
Cawthorne's financial records. The audit cost more than $25,000, according to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations mark the second time in a decade that an Urban League official 
has been accused of financial improprieties. In 1982, president Clarence 
Pendleton resigned after being ordered to rehire a former controller who 
claimed that Pendleton had misspent $94,000 of a federal grant. Pendleton died 
of a heart attack in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The detailed complaint alleges that, on seven occasions, between Nov. 19, 1987 
-- little more than three months after Cawthorne had been hired -- and Nov. 23, 
1988, Cawthorne used the Urban League checking account to pay for more than 
$3,200 worth of airplane tickets "for personal travel unrelated to business." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also charges that Cawthorne was reimbursed by "third parties" for 
some of the tickets but did not pay back the Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
Between May 11, 1988, and May 31, 1989, Cawthorne issued checks worth more than 
$2,200 to pay for "meals, travel, auto expenses, hotel accommodations, dental 
treatments and other purchases charged on (an Urban League) credit card which 
were personal in nature." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Brady-Davis declined to provide details on where Cawthorne 
traveled or which third parties reimbursed him because she did not have 
documentation at her office. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear from what we saw on the credit card statements that there were 
some expenditures for dental work that the league paid for," Brady-Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the automobile expenses involved the unauthorized rental of a car when 
Cawthorne traveled to another city. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 23, 1988 and March 10, 1988, Cawthorne authorized the issuance of 
$1,866 in Urban League checks to pay for the rental of a car while his own was 
"not functioning," according to the lawsuit and Brady-Davis. However, Cawthorne 
also collected $1,100 in his monthly automobile allowance and mileage 
reimbursement for the same period, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
"He rented a car and charged that to the Urban League, and records indicate he 
was still receiving an auto allowance and mileage at that point," Brady-Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most unusual charge pertains to Cawthorne's alleged 1988 purchase 
of a $1,395 painting from a Portland, Ore., art gallery, with two checks drawn 
on the Urban League account Feb. 6 and March 21, 1989, according to the 
lawsuit. Cawthorne came to San Diego in 1987 from Portland, where he headed 
that city's Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
The art was never delivered to the Urban League, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
In another count, the lawsuit claims that Cawthorne purchased two tickets to 
the 1988 Super Bowl in San Diego using $2,400 in Urban League funds. The board 
had approved a plan to attract a celebrity to San Diego for an Urban League 
fund-raiser. Brady-Davis declined to name the celebrity, but one source 
identified her as talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
When the plans fell through, the lawsuit claims, Cawthorne gave one or both of 
the tickets to Vernon Sukumu, president of the Black Federation, the 
organization that now also employs Cawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne and a friend attended the Super Bowl as a guest of The Los Angeles 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to hear that the tickets were an issue, because he and a 
friend were among 50 community leaders who were guests of The Times," said 
Phyllis Pfeiffer, general manager of The Times San Diego County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Brady-Davis and McQuater said board members were disturbed to learn of how 
Cawthorne had disposed of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was that we would do an alternative fund-raising event," Brady-Davis 
said. "The plan wasn't that we would give (the tickets) away, I'll tell you 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also accuses Cawthorne of collecting $2,850 in mileage 
reimbursements without providing documentation for the expenses he incurred. 
</P>
<P>
Under his contract with the Urban League, Cawthorne was paid a salary of 
$58,000 the first year and $66,700 during the second year, according to the 
lawsuit. In addition, he received a $400 monthly automobile allowance and as 
much as $150 for mileage. Cawthorne also had a $500 monthly expense account, 
for which he used an Urban League credit card, the lawsuit shows. 
</P>
<P>
"What you can see is we're not dealing with someone who is not 
well-compensated," Brady-Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady-Davis and McQuater said no public funds were misspent, but said that, 
because the Urban League relies heavily on charitable contributions, the board 
of directors had a fiduciary responsibility to donors and the National Urban 
League to recoup the alleged losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Brady-Davis maintained that the volunteer board would have been unable to 
prevent the losses through tighter oversight of Cawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
"We go over our reports item by item, but when you get a line item and there's 
a certain amount there, we can only trust that the information there is 
accurate," she said.

NORTH AND SOUTH AREN'T THE ONLY EXTREMES AT ENTRYWAYS

<P>
Although they share the same shape and the same street, two monuments that mark 
the main gateways to Oxnard are, well, poles apart. 
</P>
<P>
At the south end of town, rows of tall posts next to Oxnard Boulevard near Rose 
Avenue welcome travelers to the city. 
</P>
<P>
At the north end of town, rows of tall posts next to the boulevard's 
intersection with Gonzales Road do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
The poles on the south side were constructed of steel and precisely lined up to 
form a $250,000 high-tech sculpture that has become a cornerstone of a new city 
art program. 
</P>
<P>
But the poles on the north side are made of $600 worth of wood that was 
haphazardly grouped to form the kind of eyesore that city officials say they 
are struggling to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-pole metal sculpture on the south side of town is called 
"Connections." The artwork stands in the Channel Islands Business Park and was 
commissioned two years ago by the developer of the $200-million industrial 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
No one can remember when the six wooden poles were put up at the north end of 
town. They form a semicircle next to the busy boulevard, which also serves as 
part of California 1. Officials say the telephone pole-size posts are the legs 
to billboards -- things that have worn out their welcome in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have been trying for years to regulate signs, said Dennis 
Tagashira, an Oxnard planner. Large pole signs are banned at new developments 
and at commercial buildings that are being remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
"If a nonconforming billboard falls down or someone hits it, we don't let them 
put it back up," said Richard Maggio, community development director for 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"That billboard up there on those poles was either hit or something happened to 
it. We won't let them put the sign back up. But the poles are legal." 
</P>
<P>
The same beautification effort led the Oxnard Planning Commission in 1985 to 
begin requiring developers to install murals, fountains and sculpture through 
an unusual "Art in Public Places" program. 
</P>
<P>
The art dedication program was expanded and beefed up last October by the 
Oxnard City Council, which approved permanent guidelines for developers. 
</P>
<P>
Art donations are required of developers building 100,000 square feet or more 
of interior space. Builders must provide outside artwork that is "reasonably 
visible to the public" and is as vandal-proof and weatherproof as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Works can include sculptures, fountains, murals, statues and other expressions 
of art that are approved in advance by a city committee. But it has to be art, 
not advertising: No "signage or logos" are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 builders have agreed to spruce up Oxnard by commissioning public 
works of art. Officials estimate the value of the artwork at about $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Channel Islands Business Park's pole sculpture, there is a 
sculpture fountain at the Financial Plaza high-rise, a similar sculpture at the 
Ransco Industries project on Statham Parkway, a brushed aluminum sculpture at 
the Sammis Business Center, two granite waterfalls at the BMW auto dealership 
at Hueneme Road and Arcturus Avenue, and a mural at the South Oxnard Center. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say four other art projects have been approved for construction this 
year. They are a sculpture called "Flight of Fish" at the North Coast Executive 
Center, a sculpture called "Northern Lights" at the new Plaza del Norte, a 
sculpture at the Oxnard Auto Center and a kinetic aluminum sculpture at the 
Chevron Building. 
</P>
<P>
Two other developers have given the city $19,000 each to commission artworks 
for their projects. They are a residential project at Ventura Road and Vineyard 
Avenue and for a Public Storage yard on Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cities of Burbank and Santa Monica are reportedly looking at 
adapting Oxnard's public arts guidelines for their own use, no other cities in 
Ventura County have inquired about the program, said Michael J. Gibson, an 
Oxnard city analyst and special projects coordinator for the Community 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's appointed Art in Public Places Committee evaluates all project 
proposals. Artists are given wide leeway with proposals, although the 
seven-member panel judges the acceptability of proposed artwork on the basis of 
its scale, its harmony with adjacent structures and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of kinetic sculpture with moving parts, "we have a structural 
engineer on the committee who watches to see there will be no risk of it 
spinning off its platform," said Gibson, who is a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
The most visible of the new artworks is "Connections," the 80-foot-high 
grouping of industrial park poles commissioned by the Told Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Urbach, vice president for marketing of the firm, said artist Robert 
Behrens' poles have created a landmark as well as a unique southern entryway to 
Oxnard. "We're ecstatic about the way it turned out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So are Oxnard officials. But some of the poles' neighbors aren't. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a waste of money. It really doesn't denote art to me," said Joe 
Pardue, a truck driver who has lived for 15 years in a neighborhood that is now 
next to the poles. 
</P>
<P>
"Art is a picture or a statue that denotes a place or time. It's something 
other than sticks." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Garcia, who can see the poles from her front door, said they are 
"dumb" -- distracting to Oxnard Boulevard motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard residents don't care for the billboard pole sculpture at the northern 
end of town either. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they look good out there at all," said Chet Corser, manager of a 
McDonald's restaurant across the boulevard from the wooden poles. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Betancourt, an Oxnard packinghouse worker, said he would like to see the 
wooden poles replaced with a copy of artist Behrens' metal poles. 
</P>
<P>
"I call the ones on the south side art. But these? They look like poles. They 
look nasty." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi said the city has endorsed the metal-pole gateway but 
not the wooden one. He said he is hopeful that the Art in Public Places program 
will eventually provide a better northern entryway to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"As people come up Highway 1, it helps make a statement," Takasugi said. 
"Here's a modern, progressive city you're coming into." 
</P>

billboards. Those on the south side form a $250,000, high-tech sculpture.

STUDENTS ACCUSE VETERAN TEACHER OF SEXUAL ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM GOMPERS, AND AUTHORITIES ARE 
ALSO INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL FAILED TO PROPERLY REPORT 
ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
A veteran teacher at Gompers Secondary School has been accused of sexual abuse 
by several students and last week was transferred to a non-classroom position 
off campus while authorities investigate the allegations, it was learned 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are also investigating whether Gompers Principal Marie Thornton, 
already under fire for purported management shortcomings at the Southeast San 
Diego school, violated state law by failing to properly report the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Police expect to complete their investigation sometime next week and present 
their findings to the district attorney for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police supervisors in the child-abuse unit said Friday that 
detectives have been at the school this week. A source at the school said 
Friday that "the place has been crawling with police" and that the campus was 
"abuzz" concerning the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We are investigating allegations of child molestation at Gompers, and a 
subject of the investigation is a teacher, for having committed sexual 
molestation," said Lt. Jerry D. Moody of the child abuse squad. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Dyer, legal counsel for the San Diego Unified School District, confirmed 
Friday that the teacher has been moved from Gompers to a non-teaching position 
at the Instructional Materials Center in Linda Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"When a serious allegation is made, our procedure is to remove the employee 
away from youngsters pending outcome of the investigation, because of the 
sensitivity," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
City schools Supt. Tom Payzant said Friday that he understands police have 
talked to a number of people, including the principal, "but I don't know what 
the results of the investigation are as yet." 
</P>
<P>
Both police and top district officials declined to comment on specifics, but 
several sources within the district, who asked not to be identified, provided 
additional details. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 30 potential victims over several years may be involved, one 
well-placed source said. The source also said that the teacher was counseled 
several years ago at Gompers in connection with a previous case of suspected 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Moody said Friday that the number has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know for sure until we finish our investigation how many may have 
been victims," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
One central office source said Thornton did not immediately report the 
accusations when she received them in late March, even though state law says 
that a principal or other staff number "must report" suspected child abuse "by 
telephone immediately, or as soon as practically possible," and follow up with 
a written report within 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Both school police and the county Integrated Child Protective Services must be 
called under the law. Otherwise, the principal or staff person can be subject 
to criminal misdemeanor prosecution and, if convicted, face a six-month jail 
term, a $1,000 fine, or both. 
</P>
<P>
Another source said two students took allegations to Thornton and that, before 
contacting police, Thornton confronted the teacher during a meeting at which 
the two students were present. The education code states, in underlined 
passages, that "school personnel must keep in mind that investigation and 
suspected child abuse is the responsibility of the child welfare unit and, when 
appropriate, assessment is made by Nurse Intervention Task Force; it is not the 
responsibility of school personnel." 
</P>
<P>
The same source said parents of the students called district school officials, 
irate about the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thornton reportedly notified the Gompers school police officer the 
following day, Child Protective Services -- which intervenes to make sure that 
students are adequately counseled after suspected child abuse -- was not 
notified until almost a week later by an assistant principal, a third source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton could not be reached late Friday for comment. A Gompers source said 
that, during a staff meeting Wednesday, Thornton ordered all male school 
employees not to be in any room alone with a female as a precaution during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
When state law was changed two years ago to tighten reporting and investigating 
requirements, the school district made a major effort, including the production 
of a film, to educate principals and teachers about their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We started this huge in-service of the staff," a ranking school official said 
of a training program, "because of our historical experiences at schools when 
people would not report allegations because they would say, 'Gee, the guy 
looked so nice, we couldn't believe that he did it.' But the law was changed so 
there is no discretion now." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton has been under fire for her role in handling a February student 
demonstration at Gompers, the award-winning, high-powered math/science/computer 
magnet school. Payzant said earlier this week that Thornton planned poorly for 
the demonstration, to which police responded with more than 40 officers. A 
violent confrontation was narrowly avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Key board sources told The Times earlier this week that Thornton will receive a 
written reprimand and that district trustees have discussed removing her, 
despite continued strong community support. Thornton has backed Payzant's 
renewal plan for bringing more black neighborhood students to the magnet school 
-- designed to attract whites to integrate the minority school -- but she has 
been unable to coalesce a faculty divided over whether the plan would dilute 
the school's quality.

CRITICS SAY USD COMPROMISED ITS INDEPENDENCE BY BARRING KILLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN and DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The University of San Diego's cancellation of an on-campus conference because 
of state Sen. Lucy Killea's participation drew widespread criticism Friday from 
Catholic theologians and others as an infringement of academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Defending their decision, USD officials said Friday that they scrapped the 
event to head off what they perceived as a potential embarrassment for Bishop 
Leo T. Maher, whose clash with Killea over her advocacy of abortion rights 
generated a national controversy last fall. But others argued that the action 
had precisely the opposite effect and raised serious questions about academic 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
"Any action like this is a very discouraging and disturbing thing," said Father 
Thomas Reese, a fellow at Georgetown University's Woodstock Theological Center. 
"Academia is supposed to be the place where various views are discussed and 
debated in a reasonable fashion. It's difficult to do that when you start 
barring people because of their views." 
</P>
<P>
But USD President Author Hughes, who prohibited the conference from being held 
on campus so long as Killea was involved, said Friday that he "did not regard 
this as an academic freedom issue." Rather, Hughes argued that his decision, 
made after discussing the issue with Maher, simply reflected his desire to 
avoid a "public affront and embarrassment" for the bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was not what Mrs. Killea has said, what her personal convictions 
are, what her relationship is to the church," Hughes said. "The issue was 
whether or not it was appropriate for this institution to make her a guest . . 
. in view of the recent conflict. My judgment was that's inappropriate, because 
it would be viewed by the Catholic community as an affront to the bishop." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from USD administrators' decision last month to cancel a 
March 16-18 meeting on political campaign tactics the week before the event 
because of their discomfort over Killea's inclusion among its speakers. The 
conference was to have been co-sponsored by USD's political science department 
and a La Jolla consulting firm headed by Brenda Kinnaman, who raised funds for 
Killea during her successful 39th District state Senate race last December. 
</P>
<P>
During that campaign, Maher denied Communion to Killea because of the San Diego 
Democrat's support for legalized abortion -- igniting a political and religious 
firestorm that figured prominently in her upset victory in the heavily 
Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
Though Killea, who obtained a master's degree in history from USD, did not 
intend to specifically discuss the abortion issue at the conference, Hughes 
said he feared that her mere appearance would revive the 4-month old 
controversy. When he discussed the matter with Maher, the bishop shared his 
concern, saying, as Hughes recalled, "Yes, there could be some difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
At first, officials at the independent Catholic university told Kinnaman that 
the meeting could not be held as planned because of a last-minute scheduling 
conflict at USD's Douglas Manchester Conference Center. But, when Kinnaman 
sought to reschedule the event, USD administrators acknowledged that Killea's 
involvement was the real reason behind the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Catholic theologians and others interviewed by The Times on Friday 
reacted negatively to the cancellation, terming it an ill-conceived gesture 
that undermined the university's academic independence from diocesan concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that the administration bows to forces external to the academic 
community, in this case a bishop, that is inappropriate in an academic 
setting," said Father Richard McCormick, a longtime professor of theology and 
essayist at University of Notre Dame. "A self-image of being self-protective, 
of being involved in sectarian indoctrination and proceeding that way, means 
you've forfeited the right to be called a university." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the associate secretary for the Washington-based American Assn. of 
University Professors called USD's action "clearly inconsistent" with the 
principles of academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"For the university to disinvite a person on the basis that the person's 
presence may cause potential embarrassment to the institution" is the kind of 
issue with which the association is too familiar, Jonathan Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are (many) instances where members of the board of trustees of an 
institution are concerned that a person will show up who will embarrass them, 
whether the issue is abortion, or Palestinian rights or black nationalism," 
Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Hughes on Friday, San Diego City Councilman Wes Pratt, 
another USD alumnus, criticized the president's decision as "shortsighted and a 
very significant disservice" to the university. 
</P>
<P>
"Your decision . . . belies a disregard for a basic tenet of education: the 
spirit of exploration and debate," Pratt wrote. "You have unfortunately shifted 
the focus of community concern . . . onto the issue of censorship of education 
at the university. This diminishes the institution's reputation and 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Offering a contrary viewpoint shared by some Catholic leaders, Sister Alice 
Gallin, executive director of the Assn. of Catholic Colleges and Universities, 
also in Washington, argued that USD's action does not curtail academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any academic freedom involved," Gallin said, defining that term to 
mean the unfettered rights of professors to teach and conduct research. "What 
is involved here is institutional autonomy, the judgment that something or 
someone is not appropriate for their institution at this particular time." 
Father James Burtchaell, another Notre Dame theologian, added: "To me, this is 
not big news. If somebody got squashed for the opinions he expressed in the 
classroom, I'd be more concerned." 
</P>
<P>
But, within the USD political sciences department, at least several professors 
objected privately to the cancellation, arguing that, from their perspective, 
it did strike at the issue of academic freedom. "This could be seen as just 
another case of the church influencing -- some would say dictating -- 
university policy," said one professor, who, like his colleagues, asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that the issue of church influence has been raised 
at USD. In 1986, Helen Copley, publisher of the San Diego Union, was pressured 
to quit the board of trustees by Maher after a series of articles about 
clerical scandals in the San Diego diocese ran in the paper. Indeed, Hughes 
himself called the incident a clear case of clerical interference. 
</P>
<P>
But, in this instance, Maher spokesman Dan Pitre reiterated Hughes' explanation 
of how the decision was made, emphasizing that the bishop did "not apply 
pressure, recommend or dictate" the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"The bishop shared Dr. Hughes' concern that this could cause a problem with a 
good segment of the Catholic population," Pitre said. "But Dr. Hughes was then 
free to make his own decision." Maher declined to be interviewed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
USD began as a college owned and operated by the San Diego diocese, but became 
an independent Catholic university in 1972 when the College of Men merged with 
the College of Women, which had been operated by an order of nuns called the 
Society of the Sacred Heart. 
</P>
<P>
The diocese and the society maintain fours seats on the 34-member board of 
trustees to protect their land and other assets turned over to USD in 1972. 
Maher has been elected board chairman every year since 1972, but will retire 
this summer and be replaced as chairman by shopping center developer Ernest 
Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the planned conference -- less than four months before Maher 
reaches the church's mandatory retirement age of 75 -- was a consideration in 
the decision, USD officials conceded. Hughes, for example, said he recognized 
that Killea's planned participation in the conference had "a public relations 
overtone." 
</P>
<P>
Not only could her appearance have been perceived as an insult to Maher, some 
said, but it also could have sent an unintended -- and undesired -- subliminal 
message: that Killea was quietly being forgiven for her divergence from church 
orthodoxy on the volatile abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, speculated that, had the conference been allowed to proceed as 
scheduled, it might have unfolded quietly, drawing minimal, if any, press 
coverage. It was not Killea's planned appearance, they argued, but rather USD 
leaders' refusal to permit it, that magnified the issue and conjured up 
memories of the dispute from last December's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Either way, they might have gotten some bad press," one theologian concluded.

AUDIT QUESTIONS $8,400 WORTH OF ELY'S EXPENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An audit of Ventura County Community College District Trustee Tom Ely's 
financial records found that he charged $8,400 worth of questionable expenses 
to the district, according to a source close to the Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, an Oxnard accounting firm reported details of the audit to 
college Chancellor Barbara Derryberry. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a copy of the audit Tuesday, the Ventura County district 
attorney's office upgraded its probe of Ely from an inquiry to a criminal 
investigation, said Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said his office was looking into the possible misappropriation of 
several thousand dollars in district funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, a 54-year-old Simi Valley resident running for the 4th District county 
supervisor's seat, said the investigation was just an attempt by Bradbury to 
get press attention. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has said the audit contained "not one implication of impropriety." He 
blamed the auditors' questions on what he said was their own misunderstanding 
of financial records and on poor bookkeeping by the district. 
</P>
<P>
The district commissioned the audit two weeks ago after learning of Ely's 
alleged gambling activities and after a disclosure that he used his district 
telephones to call hotels and casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement sources have said that Ely owes about $40,000 to some of the 
best known casinos and hotels in Las Vegas. In February, the Golden Nugget 
casino in Las Vegas sued Ely over alleged gambling debts of $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has admitted some debts but said his losses have been greatly exaggerated 
in the media.

OLYMPIC EFFORT BACKED BY NEW PLATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
License plates designed to help finance the building of an Olympic Training 
Center near Chula Vista can be ordered now at a cost of $135 at any DMV office. 
</P>
<P>
The plates, with a May delivery date, will be emblazoned with the United States 
Olympic Training Center logo and can be personalized. 
</P>
<P>
Sales will go toward repaying a $15-million loan from the state's general fund 
to the San Diego National Sport Training Foundation, the nonprofit foundation 
behind the center's development. The loan will be given to the group in 
increments over three years. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation will receive $100 from each sale, with $35 going to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles to cover administrative costs, said Bill Gengler, 
a DMV spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian approved the loan in October amid concern that the 
foundation would be unable to repay it. David Nielsen, executive vice president 
of the foundation, said a provision of the law that permitted the loan requires 
repayment within 20 years. He said sales of special license plates during the 
1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games netted about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics have a broad appeal, and this will open up a new series of vanity 
plates," Nielsen said. "Closer to home (in Southern California), there is a lot 
of support for the training center." 
</P>
<P>
The plates will be issued with either the letters CA or US as a part of the 
seven-character license. Nielsen said people who were unable to get vanity 
plates because the letters or numbers they wanted were unavailable will now be 
able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Eicher, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said the plates will be 
heavily promoted, and a statewide public service campaign this summer will 
boost the fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"California has a vested interest in this," Eicher said, noting that about 30% 
of the athletes who participated in the 1988 Olympics were from California. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation president and former San Diego City Councilwoman Gloria McColl said: 
"This training center will give even more Californians the chance to compete in 
the Olympics because they now have access to state-of-the-art training, 
virtually in their own back yards." 
</P>
<P>
The training center is on 154 acres and will overlook the Lower Otay Reservoir, 
about 15 miles from downtown San Diego. It will include housing for 300 
athletes, a 57,000-square-foot gymnasium, nine playing fields, a 50-meter pool, 
a 20,000-square-foot visitors center and administrative offices. The land and 
the infrastructure -- streets, sewers and drains -- were donated by EastLake 
Development Co. and are valued at $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Construction will cost about $59 million, said Eicher, adding that the 
foundation has already received about $39 million in private pledges. Ground 
breaking will be in June, and construction is expected to take 18 months, 
Eicher said. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be the third Olympic Training Center in the country, but it 
will be the first to warm-weather, year-round location. The other two are in 
Colorado Springs and Lake Placid, N.Y., Eicher said.

CONTEST TO STRESS WATER CONSERVATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County is holding its first water-efficient landscaping contest to 
publicize the need for water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Water Conservation Program will accept landscape entries 
that are compatible with the semiarid climate and are water-efficient, said 
Deborah Weinstock, water conservation assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The judging categories will be irrigation practice, water management, plant 
selection and culture, lawn type and size, overall water efficiency and 
landscape design and aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
"If the whole thing is lawn, that wouldn't be considered water-efficient," 
Weinstock said. "But if there's a small portion of lawn with other plants that 
are water-efficient, that would be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"The contest is an educational program to show that water-efficient landscapes 
can be very, very beautiful, and we'd just like to recognize those people who 
have already put them in," Weinstock said. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline is April 27. For entry forms, call 805-654-2466 or 805-654-2440.

YOUNG READERS JOIN A STORYBOOK PARADE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of elementary students, dressed as their favorite storybook 
characters, marched in a colorful parade Friday marking Justin School's first 
"Living Literature" festival. 
</P>
<P>
The parade was the culmination of a four-week reading program aimed at 
increasing parent-child interaction and inspiring a love of reading in the 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Students were also treated to punch and cookies while attending the "Mad 
Hatter's Tea Party." 
</P>
<P>
For the past month, students were encouraged to turn off their television sets 
for at least 15 minutes each night and spend time reading with their parents. 
Those participating in the program signed contracts to make their commitment 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the crowd was Principal Patt Guthrie, appearing as "Granny Goose." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great way to build better family relationships," Guthrie said. 
"Children tend to associate reading with good feelings. It's almost always a 
positive experience for them since you can't be angry with someone while you're 
reading to them." 
</P>
<P>
Family reading sessions also give parents something new to talk with their 
children about. But the key to it all, Guthrie said, "is teaching kids to love 
to read." JONATHAN GAME

<P>
You wouldn't expect a tour guide to wear tattered jeans and sport a somber 
expression framed by long hair and an even longer beard. Except, perhaps, in 
free-form Venice, where ex-hippie Joe Sigler fits in perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
His business card is a matchbook from the nearby Sidewalk Cafe on Ocean Front 
Walk. He waits there each day for passers-by to stop at his display -- "Joe's 
Venice Walking Tours." 
</P>
<P>
A resident for 33 years, the affable Joe needs no script. He'll set out in any 
direction, tailoring his one-hour commentary to the customer. He can lecture on 
the murals, such as Rip Cronk's "Venice Reconstituted," which depicts several 
characters (including Joe). Or the one-time haunts of the celebrities, like 
Charlie Chaplin's penthouse in the Waldorf Hotel. Or Venice's hideaways, such 
as the tunnels used by rum runners during Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, age 48, doesn't sugar-coat his lecture. Take the story of why he abandoned 
his old job as a one-man motorcycle errand service. Someone stole his 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it looked as though L.A. was joining the Cultural Big Leagues, with 
the Getty Museum purchase of Van Gogh's "Irises," the town's other Van Gogh is 
covered over. 
</P>
<P>
It's "Starry Night," as rendered by Scott Dosch on a mural near Joe's station 
off Ocean Front Walk. A Bob Dylan mural was recently slapped over it. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan isn't exactly a sensation these days. Then, again, a whole block of shops 
in that area seem to have experienced some sort of LSD flashback. 
</P>
<P>
Storefronts bear '60s bumper stickers with such utterances as "Goldwater for 
Halloween," newspaper clippings of old anti-police demonstrations, and posters 
of long-dead heroes, like comic Lennie Bruce. There's even an incense-filled 
"head" shop. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the Dylan mural and all the rest are props for a coming movie 
about Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
Once the filming's done, the temporary unreality will give way to the true 
unreality. 
</P>
<P>
You mean they didn't already have a rule?: 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District wins our award for most 
disturbing local press release of the day (week/month/year) with this little 
bombshell: 
</P>
<P>
"Air quality officials today committed to developing a rule to phase out by 
1995 the use of a deadly gas at five major industrial facilities in L.A. County 
that could engulf thousands of people in a toxic cloud in the event of a major 
leak." 
</P>
<P>
Al Hix of Hollywood wonders if L.A. has the only dress code for taxi drivers 
that found it necessary to state that skirts would be restricted to female 
cabbies. 
</P>
<P>
MiscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone call a chili dog stand Pink's? It's a question heard more than 
a few times through the years by the founders of the half-century-old Hollywood 
eatery, Paul and Betty Pink.

HARTLEY ASKS CHIEF BURGREEN TO TALK TO GUARDIAN ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman John Hartley on Friday called on Police Chief Bob 
Burgreen to meet with the Guardian Angels and volunteered to help mediate the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at a time when we have a crime problem, any group that wants to help 
should be encouraged and not discouraged," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Guardian Angels, a civilian street-patrol unit, has asked the Police 
Department to participate in a "partnership against crime," which the 
department refused citing liability problems. The request was made amid 
allegations that the Angels overstepped bounds when making a recent citizen's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"There are major questions about the Guardian Angels," Hartley admitted, "but, 
through communications, these can be fixed up." Hartley sent his request for a 
discussion through assistant City Manager Jack McGrory. 
</P>
<P>
On March 19, Cmdr. Larry Gore, head of the department's public-affairs unit, 
met with Weston Conwell, the Angels' regional director. Conwell asked the 
department to conduct background checks of would-be members and to help train 
members. The request was refused because it could leave the city liable for the 
group's actions, said David Cohen, police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
McGrory said he had received Hartley's request and would discuss it with 
Burgreen. But, he said, a decision about a partnership has already been made. 
</P>
<P>
"There have already been lengthy meetings, and there has been no change in the 
department's position. . . . And the city manager's office supports that 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Seven Guardian Angels were detained by police March 15 and cited for 
misdemeanor battery and false imprisonment after a confrontation when they 
attempted to place two men under citizen's arrest. Because witnesses told 
police that the two men had done nothing to merit detention, the incident 
sparked police worries that the group might be abusing the citizen's-arrest 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage them to be our eyes and ears, just like any another citizens 
group," Cohen said. "But they have to abide by the same rules." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley, who represents the 3rd District, said the group is open to police 
suggestions. "I think they are willing to cooperate. I think they are willing 
to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
The group patrols downtown streets and has been patrolling in the Clairemont 
neighborhood where three young women have been fatally stabbed. Hartley said he 
has invited the group to begin patrols in his district, which includes most of 
East San Diego, Kensington, Normal Heights as well as portions of North Park, 
Encanto Heights, University Heights, Talmadge, Webster and Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
Conwell said his group has gathered more than 1,000 signatures from citizens 
requesting that Burgreen meet with the Angels.

GROUP GETS GRANT TO AID WOMEN'S SHELTER

The Ventura County Coalition Against Household Violence has received a $2,000 
grant, which will be used to provide tricycles, a new sandbox and a number of 
quality toys for a shelter for battered women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter is licensed to provide temporary housing for up to 17 women and 
children at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the shelter served the needs of 80 women and 120 children, said 
Jamie Leigh, director of the coalition, which is based in Ventura and serves 
the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
Children of battered women are often much rougher on toys due to the high 
levels of anxiety and frustration that accompany domestic violence, Leigh said, 
making extra-sturdy, high-quality toys a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which was founded in 1976, is a nonprofit organization 
associated with the United Way Foundation. A thrift shop in Ventura, run by the 
coalition, provides about 40% of its $200,000 annual budget. In addition, the 
thrift shop also donates basic household goods to battered women seeking to 
establish new homes for themselves. The grant was provided by Target Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Other programs sponsored by the coalition include a 24-hour hot line, 
counseling services for victims of violence and an educational outreach to the 
general public. Jonathan Game

BRIDGE REPAIR WORK FINISHED WEEK EARLY

<TEXT>
<P>
Repair work on the California 118 bridge over the Santa Clara River in Saticoy 
has been completed a week ahead of schedule, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Maintenance Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cabral said work on the bridge took less time than expected because, among 
other things, "once workers opened up the bridge joints, they discovered the 
condition was not as deteriorated as anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Even more helpful, he said, was "the excellent cooperation we had from drivers 
in the area who voluntarily took alternate routes, which significantly 
decreased the traffic on the bridge." The California Department of 
Transportation also increased the number of workers on the project, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral said that even though the bridge is now in excellent condition, Caltrans 
plans to widen it in the future. The timing of that project depends on whether 
voters approve Proposition 111 on the June ballot, authorizing increases in the 
gasoline tax and spending limits, he said. JACK SEARLES

the arrests of five Oxnard residents on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Oxnard Police Department, Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department, Port Hueneme Police Department and the federal Drug Enforcement 
Agency searched two houses in Oxnard and one in Port Hueneme, said Sgt. Frank

POLICE HUNT SUSPECT IN MULTIPLE RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police continued to search Friday for a man who kidnaped an Oxnard woman, held 
her captive for 27 hours and raped her repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Police distributed wanted posters with a composite picture of a man who 
sodomized and raped the 24-year-old woman after abducting her from the parking 
lot of a Port Hueneme beauty salon, said Detective Dale Harbin of the Port 
Hueneme Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect forced the woman to remain blindfolded in the bedroom of a house or 
apartment, Harbin said she told police. She was not allowed to eat, drink or 
use a bathroom, Harbin said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect abducted the woman while she was on her way to the beauty salon at 
11 a.m. Tuesday by threatening her with an object she thought was a gun pointed 
in her back. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then directed the woman to get into his car, believed to be a white 
Ford Escort station wagon, blindfolded her and forced her to lie down on the 
back seat. 
</P>
<P>
They drove for 15 minutes before arriving at the residence, where the assault 
occurred, Harbin said. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. Wednesday, the man drove her back to her car in the 400 block of West 
Channel Islands Boulevard and removed the blindfold. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'll be watching you," before he drove away, Harbin said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman immediately contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
"She was obviously distraught and shaken and cried off and on," Harbin said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman described the suspect as a Mexican male in his early to mid 30s with 
straight black hair and green eyes. The suspect is about 5 feet, 10 inches 
tall, has a medium build and was cleanshaven. CAROL WATSON

A 19-year-old man who was burned over 90% of his body, after coming into 
contact with 138,000 volts of electricity, died early Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Daniels of El Cajon was climbing on top of a San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric substation in Lakeside about 4 a.m. Thursday when he touched the 
high-voltage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The contact caused an explosion and triggered an alarm. An employee responding 
to the alarm found Daniels, clad only in tennis shoes; his clothing had burned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the equipment, Daniels climbed an 8-foot-high barbed-wire fence in the 
southeast corner of the Los Coches substation at Lake Jennings Park and El 
Monte roads, an SDG&amp;E spokeswoman said. He then climbed atop a steel girder 
and touched the equipment that caused the explosion. Why he was on top of the 
substation is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is investigating, Detective William Campbell said.

<P>
A pickup truck driving north on Interstate 5 near Oceanside overturned Friday 
and injured four people, one seriously, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. about half a mile north of Harbor Drive, 
when the driver apparently fell asleep and drifted into the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
The truck traveled about 275 feet -- damaging a metal center divider and 
knocking down a cable fence -- before it overturned in the southbound lane. 
Several passengers were thrown from the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital-La Jolla, 
including an unidentified male passenger listed in critical condition with a 
head injury. Listed in good condition at the hospital were Israel Medina, who 
had a head injury, and Fidencio Herrera, 29, who had a broken rib. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth person, Gustavo Flores, 21, was taken to Tri-City Medical Center, 
where he was treated and released.

<P>
One of a group of undocumented workers who allegedly were kidnaped and robbed 
last year by two San Diego police officers was sentenced Friday to three years 
in prison on two counts of auto burglary and one count of possession of 
hashish. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Rooten, the deputy district attorney prosecuting the two officers, said 
he does not think the sentence imposed against Rolando Carrera Reyes will hurt 
his case against the policemen when it goes to trial April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Carrera Reyes was awaiting sentencing in August when he 
allegedly was kidnaped and robbed by Officers Lloyd J. Hoff and Richard P. 
Schaaf. "We knew he had these convictions all along," Rooten said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff and Schaaf are charged with felony counts of kidnaping three Latino men in 
the downtown area, including Carrera Reyes, and then driving them to isolated 
areas. Two of the Latinos, including Carrera Reyes, were then robbed and 
abandoned by the officers, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
With the trial set to begin in nine days, and concerns that the Latinos might 
flee the country before then, Rooten said the sentence for Carrera Reyes 
ensures his appearance at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"At least now we'll know where he is," Rooten said.

VENTURA BOULEVARD SUBWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission voted recently to build three 
rail lines in Los Angeles County, including one across the eastern San Fernando 
Valley, over the next 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also voted to study the option to build the subway under Ventura 
Boulevard in lieu of a route along the Southern Pacific Burbank branch. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wise decision considering the following facts: 
</P>
<P>
Ridership. The RTD presently operates 70 buses along Ventura Boulevard carrying 
70,000 passengers per day, the second highest ridership sector in the city. The 
highest projected ridership of the proposed alternatives is 48,900 
average-weekday trips. 
</P>
<P>
Impact on the business community. If a rail line were built along the Southern 
Pacific Burbank branch, RTD would be required to take most, if not all, of its 
buses out of service along that route, an action that will definitely affect 
businesses along the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Funding sources available. The RTD is now negotiating multimillion-dollar joint 
development ventures at some stations of the first leg of Metro Rail. These 
developments will provide revenue sources for the district, and at the same 
time will help to offset the cost of construction. This innovative source of 
funding would not be possible if the Southern Pacific Burbank branch were 
built. Additional cost savings will also result because there will be no need 
to purchase the expensive real estate along the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
It is also important to consider that a Ventura Boulevard rail line will 
facilitate a bus-rail interface between the north-south bus lines and the 
east-west rail line. Finally, by locating a rail system along Ventura 
Boulevard, it will place into motion land use patterns directing commercial 
development away from existing residential areas, and into designated "urban 
centers." 
</P>
<P>
We should therefore reconsider whether the rail tracks should run below Ventura 
Boulevard in the commercial core of the Valley or through residential areas 
just because there is right of way land available.

VERNAL EQUINOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I drove down Magnolia Boulevard in Sherman Oaks the other day, I observed a 
very comforting sight even though it nearly blinded me. The time was 6:03 p.m. 
and I was driving due west as the sun was just sinking below the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The awe I felt was in part due to the recognition of the event that I observed. 
It was nature proclaiming the Vernal Equinox as it has recurred for the 
umpteenth time with precision and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
In the scheme of things, this event appeared to have gone unnoticed. I did not 
see it noted in newspaper editorials or in TV or radio commentary, but in this 
world of ours with its arbitrary standards and relative criteria there is a 
certain joy to behold in the simple truths of nature. It is an event that 
demonstrates order in an often chaotic surrounding. It is a discovery that 
belongs to children, or perhaps the child within us.

SUSPECT WALKS AWAY FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prisoner being treated Friday at Mercy Hospital walked away from custody, 
apparently after a private security guard unhooked the man's chains, sheriff's 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Robledo, 34, of Cerritos, who was arrested on suspicion of felony 
hit-and-run driving and evading arrest, walked out of the hospital about 2:30 
p.m. and was still missing Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Roy Stamper of the Sheriff's Department said Robledo was injured in a 
traffic accident after a high-speed chase. He was taken to the hospital and 
placed under the watch of a security guard for the Holmes Security Co. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said the private company contracts with the county to provide hospital 
protection. The guard apparently unchained the prisoner against regulations, 
and Robledo slipped away unnoticed through a door adjoining the shower, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The escapee was described as white, 5-foot-9, 170 pounds, with blond hair and 
hazel eyes. "He was wearing hospital garb when he left," Stamper said.

ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE WILCOX CAN KEEP HIS BALLOT TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Assembly candidate Robert G. Wilcox can describe himself as an 
"assemblymember's legislative representative" on the June ballot, a Sacramento 
Superior Court judge ruled Friday, rejecting a challenge by a rival candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox's ballot designation was disputed by Paula Boland, who filed suit 
Thursday to force state election officials to reject the description as an 
exaggeration of Wilcox's credentials. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Michael J. Virga ruled that the description was not misleading and 
denied Boland's request that he order the secretary of state's office to reject 
Wilcox's ballot identification. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, a former field representative for retiring Assemblywoman Marian W. La 
Follette (R-Northridge), is on leave from his post as executive director of a 
La Follette task force to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
Wilcox and Boland are among five candidates seeking the Republican nomination 
for La Follette's seat in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Boland contended in court documents that Wilcox's ballot description "falsely 
creates the impression that Mr. Wilcox has a higher, more responsible position 
than his actual status" and implies that he "has some form of incumbency 
status." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox has maintained that the description accurately characterized his past 
duties for La Follette. He chose the identification after abandoning an earlier 
description, "Assembly executive director," after state officials challenged 
him last month to substantiate it. 
</P>
<P>
In court Friday, an attorney for Wilcox presented a written declaration from La 
Follette, who said the term "legislative representative" was accurate. Boland's 
lawyer countered with a document from Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley), who said the duties of field representatives are not "legislative" in 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
After the ruling in his favor, Wilcox said that "the people won" and he looks 
forward to debating the issues with Boland, a Granada Hills businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Boland could not be reached for comment. Campaign consultant Carlos Rodriguez 
said: "Obviously we never intended this to be a winner-loser situation. We saw 
it exclusively as an issue of what is truthful and what isn't."

JUDGE ORDERS SEPARATE TRIALS FOR TWO ACCUSED IN KIDNAP-MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient couple, accused of kidnaping and murdering a 14-year-old Chatsworth 
girl in 1987 and shooting a 13-year-old female companion, will be tried 
separately, a San Fernando Superior Court judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Coen, who had rejected earlier requests by defense attorney 
James D. Gregory that the cases be separated, granted the request Friday 
because the lawyer announced that his client, Roland Norman Comtois, did not 
wish the trial to be delayed any longer. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis E. Mulcahy, attorney for the woman, Marsha Lynn Ramos, said he is unable 
to go to trial for several months because he is busy with another case. Jury 
selection for Comtois is scheduled to begin April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold S. Lynn, who is prosecuting the 
couple, must conduct two virtually identical trials in front of separate 
juries. "It's called instant replay," Lynn said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ramos lured Wendy Masuhara and a 13-year-old friend into a camper. 
Comtois allegedly bound and gagged them and later shot them in secluded Woolsey 
Canyon, near the Chatsworth Reservoir. He tried to force the friend to orally 
copulate him and injected her with cocaine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, found walking along a canyon road, dazed and bleeding, gave police a 
description of the man, who was arrested several days later after he was shot 
and wounded by a police officer. Ramos was arrested two months later.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
STILL TOO MANY QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The war on drugs is being waged on some mean streets where law enforcement 
officers may have to make quick judgments in tense situations where they or 
others may be in danger. Most civilians understand that and are sympathetic to 
the police officer's challenges. But so far, there are more questions than 
answers in the fatal shooting by police of a suspected drug dealer last 
Wednesday outside a convenience store in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Why did plainclothes police officers from the city of Orange resort to deadly 
force when witnesses have said that Jesus Ramos Gonzalez, 27, of Santa Ana, was 
slowly backing up his pickup truck after allegedly participating in a drug 
transaction? A drug suspect would not necessarily assume that an armed person 
ordering him to halt was in fact a police officer, and these particular 
officers were from another city and working under cover. Nor is it necessarily 
true that any driver in that situation would have responded instantly to such 
an order while pulling out of a tight parking space, as witnesses have said 
Gonzalez was doing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, police sources have said that Gonzalez was not armed with a knife or 
gun when the undercover officers opened fire on him. Two witnesses have said 
they did not see a weapon either, and that the truck did not appear to be 
moving toward anyone before the shooting. So why were there four quick bullet 
holes in a pickup's windshield and a dead driver on the other side? Officers or 
citizens in the parking lot should have been clearly in danger for such a 
shooting to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Orange police, who rely on state Penal Code sections in such situations, really 
should have their own well-defined policy to guide them. But even the guidance 
they have from a 1977 state Supreme Court ruling says that deadly force should 
be used only when there is reason to believe that someone might get hurt. 
That's a common thread in firearms policies, even though most are designed to 
give discretion to officers in the field. 
</P>
<P>
There is reason to wonder whether too much license was used in this shooting 
incident. The Orange County district attorney routinely investigates such 
shootings and must pay special attention to that possibility.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: APPARENT HOMICIDE VICTIM IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale police on Friday identified an apparent homicide victim found in an 
East Wilson Avenue house as Jimmie T. Noda, 67, a self-employed gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Roger Brown said investigators believe Noda was killed late Wednesday or 
early Thursday in the house where he lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said police were still trying to determined why Noda's blood-stained 
Toyota Camry was found in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant on Sherman 
Way in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant employees alerted police early Thursday when they found the car with 
its driver's door and trunk open and blood inside. The car was registered to 
Noda. Glendale officers entered Noda's house and found his body. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said investigators have not determined whose blood was in the car or why 
the vehicle was at the restaurant. "We can only speculate that someone had a 
reason to go to that area," he said. "We haven't established any motive yet." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death will not be known until the Los Angeles County coroner's 
staff completes an autopsy in the next two or three days, but coroner's 
spokesman Bob Dambacher said Noda appeared to have been cut or stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Friday that no arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Noda's residence was part of a duplex. The victim's sister, Emiko Noda, lived 
in the other unit, but Brown said she has been traveling in Japan.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO 2ND-DEGREE MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old Los Angeles man pleaded guilty Friday to second-degree murder for 
strangling a Canoga Park woman during a burglary last year. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas L. Mecca was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison for killing 
Barbara Shanks, 46, on April 17, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber sentenced Mecca to an additional 
four years in prison for burglarizing Shanks' house. 
</P>
<P>
Mecca originally was charged with first-degree murder but pleaded guilty before 
his trial to the reduced charge, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Korban. 
</P>
<P>
Mecca came to Shanks' house in the 6500 block of Comanche Avenue early on the 
morning of April 17 seeking Shanks' daughter, a friend. The daughter was not 
home at the time, said Detective Michael Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
Mecca apparently became angry with Shanks and strangled her, then beat her on 
the head with several wine bottles, Korban said. The home was ransacked, but it 
was not known what, if anything, was taken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mecca was arrested later after he told several people about the killing, Korban 
said.

FACES . . . : PROVOST COMES HOME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From 1957 through 1964, Jon Provost enjoyed television stardom as Timmy Martin, 
young master of the collie Lassie in the classic CBS series of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when he discovered that MCA-TV was planning an updated, syndicated 
version of the show, he contacted "The New Lassie" producer Al Burton to offer 
his services as a consultant -- and wound up instead with a recurring role as 
Steve McCulloch, uncle to Lassie's current 10-year-old owner, Will McCulloch. 
In Los Angeles, the show airs Saturdays at 7:30 p.m. on KCAL Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
For Provost, who turned 40 last month, the role meant not only a return to the 
show but to acting as well. Having begun his career at age 2 1/2 in the feature 
"So Big," he had decided, after the 1969 Disney film "The Computer Wore Tennis 
Shoes," to forsake show business in favor of attending Sonoma State University. 
Now a real estate salesman, he lives in Santa Rosa with his wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to L.A. to do the show was incredible -- after 15 minutes on the 
set in hair and makeup, it was like I'd never left the place," he recalls. "The 
really strange part was seeing Bob Weatherwax (whose late father, Rudd, was 
owner and trainer of the original Lassie). He has Lassie now, and he's almost 
the identical image of his dad. 
</P>
<P>
"Will Nipper, who plays my nephew, asked if I could give him some tips," 
Provost adds. "I said, 'The best advice I can give you is to have fun and enjoy 
what you're doing.' I really enjoyed what I did, even though it was hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to reruns, Provost has remained closely identified with the original 
series throughout his quarter-century "Lassie" hiatus. He has also maintained 
an active involvement with animals, working on behalf of humane societies and 
serving on the board of governors of Canine Companions for Independence, an 
organization which provides dogs to aid people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Smithsonian Institution asked Provost to donate "Lassie" 
memorabilia for its exhibit on television's 50th anniversary. "My mom sent over 
the outfit I'd worn as Timmy. When I opened the box and pulled it out -- well, 
that was serious deja vu," he says. "My son really wanted to keep the tennis 
shoes." LIBBY SLATE

FACES . . . : THE SINISTER 'TWIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday night at 9, ABC trots out its much ballyhooed crapshoot "Twin Peaks." 
You can bet your Nielsens that cult director David Lynch's eerie mystery/soap 
will be riveting to some viewers, repugnant to others. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Lara Flynn Boyle anxiously awaits America's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's designed in a way that is unique and is different but has a lot 
of television qualities, like 'China Beach,' " says Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
The perky 19-year-old, already a vet of TV's "Amerika," "The Preppie Murder" 
and several big-screen features, is an ardent fan of Lynch and this strangely 
sinister project he's conjured up. Twin Peaks is a fictional lumber town 
situated in the Northwest whose inhabitants are whipped into a frenzy following 
a grisly murder. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the pace, the ensemble cast and their different personalities, I 
think definitely, (viewers) will like it," predicts Boyle, born in Davenport, 
Iowa, but reared in Chicago. "Plus, it's very humorous. It's not one of those 
shows where the 'LAUGH' light goes on, like the sitcoms where you pretty much 
know when you should laugh and when you should cry." 
</P>
<P>
Some actors do cry when they feel shorted on screen time. With "Twin Peaks" 
boasting over a dozen main characters, how does Boyle make her thin slice of 
the pie more palatable? 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating at times," acknowledges Boyle, "but the show is done so that 
each person has a very strong quality . . . so when you work, you really have 
to remember what you bring to the show." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle asserts that "Twin Peaks' " unpredictability factor will save it from 
being just another prime-time casualty. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't really know if you'll turn on the TV and it's going to be morbid, or 
if you're going to laugh the whole hour." DAVID PECCHIA

LIMBAUGH'S HECKLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your silence is deafening. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFI-AM's infamous Rush Limbaugh appeared on "The Pat Sajak Show" March 30. 
</P>
<P>
As I write this, it is four days later. This is The Times' town. Has the 
newspaper lost its voice? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Rick Du Brow had a short item April 3 in which he used the rather benign 
term "hecklers." But it doesn't take much imagination to visualize The Times' 
outrage had the victim been a liberal and the hecklers what the media usually 
calls "dangerous and fascistic right-wing extremist censors who are destroying 
free speech."

<P>
I watched the sabotage of Limbaugh in disgust. Apparently satire is supposed to 
be the exclusive province of the left, to be dished out to the sacred cows of 
conservatives with glee, but never to be taken in kind. 
</P>
<P>
I have enjoyed the right-bashing comedy of the Smothers Brothers, Norman Lear 
and "Saturday Night Live" over the years, but it is refreshing to finally hear 
the volley returned -- not by some Wally George pinhead but by an articulate 
wag with an ironic sense of pompous self-parody.

MA, KAHANE IN RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all his popular stature, Yo-Yo Ma regularly has made his recitals 
partnerships rather than star turns. This season he is touring with pianist 
Jeffrey Kahane, and Thursday they arrived at Ambassador Auditorium, with an 
encore performance scheduled for Friday at Royce Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The generous, well-constructed program they brought placed an equal emphasis on 
the piano, while playing to Ma's singing strength as a cellist. The effort 
provided wonders of nuance and idiosyncratic delights, within completely 
natural, unexaggerated contexts. 
</P>
<P>
The novelty on the agenda, Kenneth Frazelle's new Sonata in its local premiere, 
could quickly become a repertory staple. It is identifiably American -- of the 
Ives-Copland-Schickele lineage -- and cast in three originally shaped, tonally 
centered movements. 
</P>
<P>
Ma and Kahane delivered it with clarity and affection. They stressed its 
lyrical sweetness without sentimentality, let the hushed mysteries of the 
central Adagio hover gracefully and projected barn-dance vigor in the 
rhythmically complex finale. The North Carolina-based composer was present to 
share the bows. 
</P>
<P>
Rachmaninoff's G-minor Sonata offered its characteristic Big Music 
opportunities for expressive display, which Ma and Kahane seized in fully 
integrated tandem. The surging finale came to a few too many counterproductive 
climaxes, but it had lean, concentrated power aplenty and interpretive 
unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
In transcriptions of Falla's "Siete Canciones," Kahane moved into the 
accompanying background, allowing Ma leeway for his pliant phrasing. Ma pushed 
the peerless intensity of his sound into a buzz at peak moments, but the effect 
was that of the hoarse cry of cante flamenco. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane had ample chance to work solo marvels in Beethoven's Variations on "Ein 
Madchen oder Weibchen," which he did with crystalline poise and evenly 
modulated sound. Cellist matched pianist in fleet articulation and focused 
brio. 
</P>
<P>
In encore Ma went from the spiccato bravura of Kreisler's "Tambourin Chinois" 
to the soulful song of Saint-Saens' "Le Cygne," with utmost verve and pathos.

KITARO STRIVES FOR HIGHER PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fitting that Kitaro's two-hour set Thursday night at the Universal Amphitheatre 
opened with rear-screen projections of the Japanese New Age keyboardist's name, 
corporate sponsor and the nine titles on his new "Kojiki" album on to a white 
scrim hiding the stage set. It was fitting because the blend of triumphant, 
emotional peaks with muted passages sounded like the soundtrack to a film or 
long-form video that has yet to be made. 
</P>
<P>
But give Kitaro credit -- this wasn't New Age as an exercise in creating vapid 
melodic paeans to the stress-less life, but music striving to reach a higher 
plane. Kitaro's apparent goal was attaining the sonic majesty of a Western 
symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The triad of taiko drums at the apex of his pyramid-shaped stage set was one of 
Kitaro's few nods to his Japanese heritage. His favorite synthesizer tone 
brought to mind the piper Zamfir pushing his "20 Golden Hits" album. And the 
recurrent theme throughout the "Kojiki" album, as played in its entirety during 
the first half of the performance, sounded like a variant on the tune 
"Greensleeves." 
</P>
<P>
The structured arrangements didn't give Kitaro's highly professional backing 
septet much opportunity to shine, although violinist Charlie Bisharat injected 
some visual and musical personality as the leader's chief melodic foil. The 
only variety came in a pair of full group percussion jams and two older pieces 
in the second half of the set when the band's sudden shift from full crescendo 
to a brief, soft coda was quite effective. DON SNOWDEN

QUINTET IN A HARD BOP GROOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Man for man, the Harper Brothers Quintet, a group formed four years ago by the 
drummer Winard Harper, 27, and trumpeter Philip Harper, 24, introduced Tuesday 
evening at Catalina's, is the most brilliant new jazz group of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
The age at which greatness in jazz musicians emerges seems to have diminished 
steadily over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Robinson, on alto sax, and Kevin Hayes, the pianist, are even more 
astonishing than the leaders. Both are 21. Robinson's sound is strong, his 
rhythmic nuances are personal and potent. Hayes, when not limning out 
illustrious single note lines, manages to find dissonances and chordal 
combinations you didn't know existed. Finally there is the dependable bassist, 
Eric Lemon, 30. 
</P>
<P>
With its two-man front line of trumpet and alto sax, the group is patterned 
stylistically after the hard bop groups of the 1950s and '60s. Yet this is by 
no means a nostalgia trip. These men bring their own prospective to values that 
are timeless. 
</P>
<P>
Various writers inside and outside the group have supplied the themes, which 
are modestly attractive jumping off points for the strings of solos. In the 
finale, Winard Harper contributed an ingenious solo, partly on the rims of his 
snares, then with sticks on the high-hat cymbal. 
</P>
<P>
The group offers an example of the extent to which unhyphenated, acoustic jazz 
has persevered in an era of funk, rock and fusion. The quintet closes Saturday.

BARBARIAN BROTHERS BACK IN 'THINK BIG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those identical twin bodybuilders Peter and David Paul, who call themselves the 
Barbarian Brothers, are back in "Think Big" (citywide), a movie as slight as 
they are bulky. Fortunately, it is as amiable as they are. 
</P>
<P>
The Barbarians are cast as a pair of good-natured giants, truck-driver 
brothers, who will receive the money they need for their final payment on their 
gleaming 18-wheeler once they deliver barrels of toxic waste from a small town 
in Montana to Long Beach. The toxic wastes are from TechStar, a remote think 
tank run by a greedy Martin Mull, who holds a clutch of young geniuses as 
virtual prisoners. Trying to escape is a pretty 16-year-old, Holly (Ari 
Meyers), who has invented a remote-control device capable of switching off any 
electronic switch within its proximity. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, we're into a typical chase comedy with Holly latching on to the 
kindly Barbarians and not only Mull and huge henchman Richard Kiel in hot 
pursuit but also David Carradine's sly redneck repo man, eager to get his hands 
on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
There's not much here for post-adolescent audiences -- the rating is a rather 
severe PG-13 -- but feature debuting director Jon Turteltaub (who also had a 
hand in the script) has a good sense of pace and a nice way with actors. Under 
his direction the entire cast, including the Barbarian Brothers themselves, are 
relaxed and amusing, and Mull and especially Carradine work up some funny 
characterizations. KEVIN THOMAS

beauty to be an asset as well as gold and silver, or cabbage and potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
This was the pledge of Norwegian immigrant Ole Hanson, who began the town of 
San Clemente in 1925. It was quite a promise from a real-estate developer, 
quite a promise in those days of shameless boosterism half a century before the 
California Coastal Commission was established. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to Hanson's vision, some of the peaceful ambiance of San 
Clemente, which he regarded as "a painting 5 miles long and a mile wide," has 
been preserved. And some of its isolation too. Most everyone in the real-estate 
community thought Hanson crazy for building in a locale 66 miles from San Diego 
and 66 miles from Los Angeles, but today this isolation attracts rather than 
repels. Isolation was one of the reasons former President Richard Nixon 
(1969-74) established his Western White House on the bluffs above San Clemente 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Beach is a great place for a walk. The beach is mercifully walled 
off from the din of the San Diego Freeway and the confusion of the modern world 
by a handsome line of tan-colored bluffs. Only the occasional train passing 
over Santa Fe Railroad tracks located near the shore interrupts the cry of the 
gull, the roar of the breakers. The trestles, located at the south end of San 
Clemente Beach at San Mateo Point, gave Trestles Beach its name. 
</P>
<P>
Trestles Beach is one of the finest surfing areas on the West Coast. When the 
surf is up, the waves peel rapidly across San Mateo Point, creating a great 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
Before the area became part of the state beach, it was restricted government 
property belonging to Camp Pendleton Marine Base. For more than 25 years, 
surfers carried on guerrilla warfare with U.S. Marines: Trespassing surfers 
were chased, arrested and fined, and on many occasions had their boards 
confiscated and broken in two. Find a veteran surfer and he'll tell you about 
escapes from Jeep patrols and guard dogs. Many times, however, the cool Marines 
charitably gave surfers rides while out on maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
This hike's destination, San Mateo Point, is the northernmost boundary of San 
Diego County and the beginning of Orange County. When the original counties of 
Los Angeles and San Diego were set up in 1850, the line that separated them 
began on the coast at San Mateo Point. When Orange County was formed from 
southern Los Angeles County in 1889, San Mateo Point was established as the 
southern point of the new county. You can have the fun of sunning in one 
county, swimming in another. 
</P>
<P>
Hikers with the time and inclination can easily extend this beach walk several 
miles south to San Onofre State Beach. Another option worth considering is to 
take the train to San Clemente and walk south from the Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5) in San 
Clemente, exit on Avenida Calafia and head west a half-mile to Calafia Beach 
Park, where there is metered parking. You can also park for a fee at San 
Clemente State Beach. A limited amount of free parking is available in the 
residential area near the state beach. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: From Calafia Beach Park, cross the railroad tracks, make your way 
down an embankment and head south. As you'll soon see, San Clemente State Beach 
is frequented by plenty of shore birds, as well as plenty of surfers, body 
surfers and swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
At distinct San Mateo Point, which marks the border of Orange and San Diego 
counties, you'll find San Mateo Creek. The headwaters of the creek rise high in 
the Santa Ana Mountains above Camp Pendleton. A portion of the creek is 
protected by the Cleveland National Forest's San Mateo Canyon Wilderness. 
Rushes, salt grass and cattails line the creek mouth, where sandpipers, herons 
and egrets gather. 
</P>
<P>
Ford the creek mouth (rarely a problem except after winter storms) and continue 
south toward San Onofre State Beach and the giant domes of San Onofre Nuclear 
Power Plant. Or you can return the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a third alternative, an inland return route: Walk under the train 
trestles and join the park service road, which is usually filled with surfers 
carrying their boards. The service road takes you up the bluffs, joins the San 
Clemente Coastal Bike Trail, then winds through a residential area to an 
entrance to San Clemente State Beach Campground. Improvise a route through the 
campground to the park's entry station and join a footpath next to the station. 
</P>
<P>
The path descends through a prickly pear-filled draw to Calafia Beach Park and 
the trailhead. The wind- and water-sculpted marine terraces just south of the 
trailhead resemble Bryce Canyon in miniature and are fun to photograph.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: KEEPSAKES MUST BE KEPT SAFELY

Among the keepsakes of genealogists are photographs of ancestors and paper 
certificates, documents and newspaper clippings. However, if they are 
improperly stored, they will not last long enough to be a treasure of 
generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
Attics and basements are the worst places to store keepsakes. Valuable photos 
should be kept where temperature, humidity and light levels are low. Color 
prints are best stored below 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 50% humidity, and in the 
dark. Avoid using plastic storage containers that may contain polyvinyl 
chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Acid-neutral boxes and envelopes are available. If you use envelopes and 
sleeves to hold your photos and slides, be sure they are made of acid-neutral 
paper, or polyester, archival polyethylene, or triacetate plastic film. 
</P>
<P>
Use photo albums with acid-neutral pages and avoid waxed pages. Adhesive tape, 
white glue, rubber cement, paper clips and mothballs or crystals can damage 
your photos. To label photos on the backside before storing or displaying -- 
and all your photographs should be identified with names, dates and places -- 
use a soft No. 1 pencil and press lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Copy old photos first, then store the negatives in a dark place. 
Black-and-white negatives will last a long time if well cared for. However, 
color slides may last only 10 to 50 years, depending on care. 
</P>
<P>
Use acid-free materials when mounting newspaper clippings and other paper 
items. Pastes made from flour and water, wheat or rice are less acidic and less 
damaging than most other pastes. However, they are subject to mildew and 
household pest damage, and may bubble or ripple the item. Linen tape can be 
used for mounting. Find an art supply store for these supplies. Before using 
anything on a valuable item, test each product for any initial staining or 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Photocopies of clippings can be mounted in scrapbooks, but the originals should 
be placed in a dark storage container. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. for State and Local History (AASLH), 708 Berry Road, 
Nashville, Tenn. 37204, publishes books and technical leaflets on the 
collection, care and preservation of many items. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know specifically what your antiques, collectibles or keepsakes 
are worth and to document their value, you will need the services of a personal 
property appraiser. Appraisers of antique and collectible keepsakes should be 
specialists. Spend as much time finding a qualified appraiser as you would 
looking for a professional in any field. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have obtained an appraisal, it should be dated, signed by the 
appraiser, along with the purpose of the appraisal and the qualities and 
disinterest of the appraiser noted. Keep the appraisal in your safety deposit 
box.

CRIME AND THE FEAR FACTOR

When Sen. Pete Wilson opened his campaign for governor in February, his first 
speeches targeted a favorite GOP subject -- crime. Those appearances in San 
Diego, Los Angeles, Alameda and Sacramento were greeted enthusiastically. 
Campaigning on the crime issue here would be a bit more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
About nine in 10 county residents in the 1989 Orange County Annual Survey 
report they feel very or at least somewhat safe in their neighborhoods during 
the day. And two-thirds say the fear of crime never or rarely prevents them 
from doing things they want to do. 
</P>
<P>
These views are not unanimous, though. Residents of the central portion of the 
county, for example, are less likely to say they feel safe. People who see 
crime as the most important public policy issue facing the county also feel 
less safe. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these feelings obtain in the matter of fear of crime's preventing free 
activity. Central county residents are more likely than those in other sections 
to say they are hindered in their activities. So are older residents and those 
in the lower income bracket. The perception of crime as the county's most 
important problem also has an effect here. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say, though, that the issue of crime is completely without 
resonance here. True, it is the fourth-rated public policy problem, behind 
traffic, growth and housing. But the percentage mentioning crime has grown, 
increasing from 8% in 1988 to 12% last year. 
</P>
<P>
This question was asked to gauge feelings of safety in county neighborhoods: 
"As far as your community is concerned, how safe do you feel walking around in 
your neighborhood during the day? Would you say you feel very safe, somewhat 
safe, somewhat unsafe or very unsafe?" 
</P>
<P>
To determine how much fear of crime affects residents, this question was asked: 
"How often does fear of crime prevent you from doing things you would like to 
do -- always, often, sometimes, rarely or never?" 
</P>
<P>
Here are the results to both questions:

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL PLAY CANCELED AFTER DRINKING 
INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final two performances of a spring play at Wilson Junior High School in 
Glendale were canceled and 12 cast members were suspended for five days because 
they drank alcohol before going on stage, school authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale schools spokesman Vic Pallos said the students admitted they drank in 
the school auditorium Wednesday evening before appearing in Shakespeare's "The 
Taming of the Shrew." 
</P>
<P>
The students apparently showed no signs of intoxication, but a parent whose 
child witnessed the drinking reported the incident. Approximately $3,500 in 
advance ticket sales will be refunded.

CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Probation Department will open the largest juvenile 
detention facility in the county next Tuesday, a 660-bed complex in Lancaster 
named for the destroyed Challenger space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-acre, $35-million Challenger Memorial Youth Center includes six camps 
named after each of the astronauts who died in the 1986 crash. The camp school 
will be named for Sharon Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who died with the 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
The complex will "have a marked impact on overcrowding in the juvenile halls," 
Director Richard Birnbaumer said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENTS OF 13 CITIES WILL NEED TO VOTE 
TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in 13 San Gabriel Valley cities on Tuesday will not discharge their 
civic duties unless they vote twice. 
</P>
<P>
In a procedure that officials concede will perplex voters, the county will have 
elections for the 26th and 31st state Senate districts while municipal 
elections are held at some of the same polling places. Voters will cast a city 
ballot, and then receive a Senate ballot to mark. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the county registrar said special elections to fill Senate 
seats vacated by the resignations of William Campbell of Hacienda Heights and 
Joseph Montoya of Whittier were called on such short notice there wasn't time 
to consolidate ballots in many cities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL COMPLETES WORK ON RITTENBERG REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city panel deciding the fate of Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg 
finished its work Friday and sent its decision to the City Council, which will 
take up the matter on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Referred Powers, which has been meeting in secret, has voted to 
fire Rittenberg for his handling of controversial city deposits in a bank that 
employs Mayor Tom Bradley, sources said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg is entitled to a hearing to appeal the panel's decision before it 
goes to the council, but no such hearing has been held, sources said. The quick 
scheduling of the matter on the council agenda could indicate a settlement has 
been reached.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
CHAMPIONS OF CITYHOOD ON DEFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a difference two years makes. 
</P>
<P>
In two years, a city was created, a City Hall was opened, and the Postal 
Service was trained to deliver mail to a new Los Angeles County address -- the 
city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
A tiny staff grew to 80 employees who now carry out the mandates of a 
$24-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
And a simple lesson of politics was learned: Once in office, the 
revolutionaries who championed change in the first place became, justly or not, 
the new target of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Clarita incorporated in December, 1987, residents said they voted 
for cityhood because they were tired of fighting an unresponsive, pro-growth 
Los Angeles County government. Winners in that election ran on the savior 
ticket: They would save their neighborhoods, their roads and their schools from 
overbuilding approved by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
But now the incumbents are being blamed -- many say unfairly -- for the very 
troubles that vaulted them into office. And with Santa Clarita's first City 
Council election since incorporation coming up Tuesday, the community's leaders 
are busy fighting among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get rid of those people on the City Council," fumed candidate Herb 
Wolfe at a recent forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for cityhood to stop all this," complained another candidate, Wayne 
Carter, referring to the thousands of new houses and apartments sprouting 
throughout the city and surrounding Santa Clarita Valley. "The City Council 
hasn't stopped anything." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, thousands of families flocked to the valley, making the 
area, now with 150,000 residents, the fastest-growing region in the county for 
the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The valley and its scores of new housing tracts became a stucco haven for 
families looking for affordable homes and a small-town atmosphere. Locals call 
it "Leave It to Beaver Country" and "Des Moines With Palm Trees." As testament 
to Santa Clarita's family values, a recent UCLA study found an unusually high 
number of diapers in the city's garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The three incumbents seeking reelection say they are being unfairly blamed for 
a host of problems that Santa Clarita inherited from the county. Mayor Jo Anne 
Darcy, Councilman Carl Boyer III and Councilman Dennis Koontz say that the 
traffic congestion, crowded schools and overdevelopment are legacies of county 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the homes under construction in Santa Clarita were approved before 
incorporation. Another 20,000 county-approved units have yet to be built, said 
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the city of Santa Clarita has allowed only 500 new housing units in 
2 1/2 years, Darcy said. And, unlike the county supervisors, the Santa Clarita 
City Council has refused to approve housing projects unless the developer wins 
the endorsement of local school officials. 
</P>
<P>
But in letters to the editor, testimony at City Council meetings and comments 
at candidates' forums, citizens have lambasted the council with terms once 
reserved for the supervisors -- corrupt, pro-growth and uncaring. These 
broadsides are aimed at people who just three years ago were leading the effort 
to secede from the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of politics," Darcy says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Santa Clarita mirrors the experience shared by many other 
new cities. Fran Pavley, who has served on the Agoura Hills City Council since 
that city incorporated in 1982, said residents there blamed the City Council 
for development approved earlier by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents facing voters for the first time since incorporation, "can't point 
to a lot of tangible achievements," Pavley said. Creating a new city government 
involves lots of nuts-and-bolts chores, such as financial audits and traffic 
studies, not likely to excite voters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Santa Clarita can point to some accomplishments. The city's crime 
rate dropped 4.2% last year. Council members attribute that to increased police 
protection paid for by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Of the disappointed residents, McKeon said: "I think they thought this would 
become Camelot. They expect the city to solve all problems." 
</P>
<P>
Growth and traffic have emerged as leading issues in the campaign that pits 
seven challengers against Darcy, Boyer and Koontz. Along with Wolfe and Carter, 
the challengers include Kenneth Dean, an architectural designer; Vera Johnson, 
a retired educator; Linda Calvert, a realtor; Andy Martin, a rancher, and Jill 
Klajic, a longtime community activist. 
</P>
<P>
Some challengers are hoping to capitalize on the public's anger over the 
council's decision to place a $275-million tax measure to build roads on last 
November's ballot. The measure lost by a 4-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"They got in office because they promised us slow growth and no taxes," Wolfe 
said. "They have gone back on us on every single promise." 
</P>
<P>
The election has produced no firebrands and, except for minor variations, the 
candidates are running on similar platforms: All oppose landfills near the 
city; all worry about traffic congestion, and all say developers should pay 
more to build schools and roads. 
</P>
<P>
One local newspaper reader complained that, after reading the candidates' 
platforms, he felt as if he had walked into an ice cream parlor and discovered 
all the flavors were vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent candidates' forum held in the back yard of a private home, about 50 
residents opposing a condominium project lounged on lawn chairs under hazy 
sunshine as the candidates denounced the project and growth in general. 
</P>
<P>
There were no carefully scripted speeches, just off-the-cuff remarks. Many of 
those attending were parents; some had brought their preschoolers along. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates attacked development as the root of all evil in Santa Clarita. 
The forum, incidentally, was held in a housing tract that opened just a year 
ago. Up and down the street, many homeowners were still putting in their 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Johnson, who regularly attends council meetings, offered a few words 
in defense of the incumbent city lawmakers. "I don't think they deserve the 
bashing they are getting," she said. "They are not in with the developers. I 
know it's probably a mistake for me to say that." 
</P>
<P>
"It is!" one man muttered. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson finished her remarks, there was only a smattering of applause.

JOURNALIST FACES NEW 'HACKER' CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors dropped charges Friday against a free-lance journalist who 
was arrested for allegedly trying to steal information from the computers of 
Fox Television's tabloid show "A Current Affair," but hours later he faced 
similar "computer hacking" charges in state court. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Goldman, 44, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court and was released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman was arrested March 8 at his Studio City apartment, where Los Angeles 
police confiscated his personal computer and floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, federal and state officials announced that Goldman had attempted 
to steal sensitive information from Fox computers in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Fox officials told authorities that someone had been trying to gain access to 
their computers and that the hacker used the same computer password in both 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman had worked briefly for "A Current Affair," a show that offers a mix of 
gossip and news. Goldman also worked for a competing show called "Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors filed an affidavit in U.S. District Court in New York last 
month stating that Goldman had attempted to gain access to sensitive files 
regarding news stories worked on by Fox journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Neither law enforcement nor Fox officials have said what information they 
believe Goldman was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman recently tried to sell an inside story on so-called tabloid television 
shows to the Los Angeles Times. On Friday, Goldman said the research on his 
article was complete, but declined to say if he had found someone to publish 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman's attorney, Alan Rubin of West Los Angeles, said Friday morning that he 
had persuaded the U.S. attorney's office in New York to drop the federal 
charges there. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors would not comment on why the charges in New York were 
dropped. Fox spokesman Dennis Petroskey also declined any comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, the district attorney's office charged Goldman with seven 
felony counts of violating the California Penal Code section prohibiting 
unauthorized access to computers. Goldman used another person's access code to 
gain entry to a Fox television computer at Channel 11 in Hollywood, according 
to Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. She said 
Goldman used telephone lines to extract material from Fox computers and place 
it into his home computer. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who has written articles for National Review magazine and the Los 
Angeles Times, among other publications, faces a maximum six-year prison term 
if convicted on all charges, Gibbons said.

A LATINO DISTRICT IS NOT POSSIBLE, COUNTY ARGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a historic voting rights trial due to end next week, attorneys for Los 
Angeles County argued Friday that the "suburbanization" of Latinos has made it 
impossible for the Board of Supervisors to carve out a district in which a 
majority of the voters are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike Southern voting rights cases, in which blacks are virtually segregated 
in one area of town, Hispanics are spread in every nook and cranny of the 
county," John McDermott said in his closing argument in the three-month-long 
case that is now winding down in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department urged District Judge 
David V. Kenyon to delay the June supervisors' election until after a new 
redistricting plan can be drafted. Attorney Steven Rosenbaum said that if the 
county loses in the trial, the supervisors should be given 30 days to submit to 
the judge a new plan designed to help a Latino win a seat on the county board. 
</P>
<P>
Although candidates for supervisor in the June 5 election have begun 
campaigning, Rosenbaum told the judge: "The campaign is still young. There is 
still time to stop the process in ways that would be fair to the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not say when he will rule on this or any of the other issues in 
the court case. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's daylong session focused on whether the plaintiffs have proven that it 
is possible to create a supervisorial district in which a majority of the 
voters are Latino. Key to the county's defense is that such a district could 
not be created during the 1981 redistricting effort or today. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in September, 1988, the Justice Department and two civil 
rights groups accused county supervisors of splitting Latino neighborhoods 
among three districts, thereby weakening their political influence in violation 
of the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott argued that the existing boundary line splitting heavily Latino 
neighborhoods in East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley does not dilute 
the Latino vote because a majority of the Latino residents there are not 
citizens or old enough to vote. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plaintiffs' case depends on the use of non-citizens to establish a 
district in which a majority of voters are Latino. Under that concept, he 
argued, "the moment that somebody comes across the border, legally or 
illegally, that person is entitled to affect the distribution of political 
power in this community." 
</P>
<P>
"We regard political power as fundamental to U.S. citizenship," McDermott 
added. "That is not something available to non-citizens." 
</P>
<P>
McDermott also contended that 67% of the Latino voters are dispersed throughout 
the county, "which is to say, they do not live where most Hispanics live." 
</P>
<P>
"The suburbanization and assimilation of third-, fourth- and fifth-generation 
Hispanics render arguments about fragmentation meaningless," the attorney 
added. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott, whose private law firm is being paid more than $2.5 million to 
defend the county in the case, argued that the plaintiffs also have failed to 
prove, as required, that Latinos vote as a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that as Latinos become upwardly mobile, they generally move out of 
the barrio and change their party registration from Democrat to Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs are seeking to establish a predominantly Latino district, from 
which a Latino would have an improved chance of winning a seat on the county 
board. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, also plaintiffs in the case, have asked the judge 
to consider expanding the board from five to seven or nine members. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon, while emphasizing that he had not reached any decision on that issue, 
questioned whether bigger is better, pointing to the 15-member Los Angeles City 
Council, where it is "sometimes difficult to get things done." He also pointed 
out that voters have twice rejected expansion of the county board.

REPORT OFFERS GUIDE FOR THE '90S ON HOW TO CLEAN UP L.A. AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acknowledging that Los Angeles has the worst air quality in the country, Mayor 
Tom Bradley and other city officials released a report Friday outlining 
possible solutions for the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
A major focus of anti-pollution efforts will be attempts to heighten public 
awareness of contaminated air and water as well as personal garbage disposal 
habits, according to the report by the city's Environmental Quality Board. 
</P>
<P>
"The 90s have got to be a time of both public education and citizen 
participation," said Felicia Marcus, a former member of the Environmental 
Quality Board who helped write the report. "People are going to have to 
understand that when they flush their toilets, that's not the end of the 
process and their responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The 87-page report, entitled "The State of the City's Environment Primer," 
contained little new information, but is intended as a basic resource for the 
public on local environmental problems and solutions. It is to be available at 
all branches of the Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
The report catalogues the city's environmental woes, beginning with "the worst 
regional air quality in the nation" and a continuing "plague" of sewage spills 
that have polluted Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
It goes on: 
</P>
<P>
"The average Southern Californian's love affair with the automobile, the lack 
of a clean regional mass transit system, the rapid growth in industry and 
population, the warm desert air, the cool ocean breezes, the surrounding 
mountains, all contribute to a pall of smog that hangs over the city on most 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosive economic growth and development of Los Angeles, combined with 
its varied, appealing geographical and physical attributes, has created a city 
on the verge of reaching the limits of its ability to provide its residents 
with clean air and water, adequate municipal services, a functioning 
infrastructure, and an aesthetically-pleasing environment." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the grim descriptions, neither Bradley nor the board members present at 
a press conference Friday would say what measures might be taken by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I want to lay out for you the things that we're going to have to 
do," Bradley said. "It is my hope that we will carefully review and evaluate 
every step that must be taken as well as those things that we will suggest." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, while conceding the city's air is the worst in the nation, was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not point to what is the greatest problem that we face. We're not 
trying to deny any of those," Bradley said. "I think that we are equal to any 
city in the country in terms of our awareness and our commitment to the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The report contains 94 recommendations on a range of environmental issues 
including toxic and hazardous waste, sewage and waste water, coastal and harbor 
pollution, and open space. Many of the recommendations call for prodding other 
governmental agencies into action. 
</P>
<P>
One suggestion called for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to 
conduct epidemiological, viral and bacterial studies to determine health risks 
for people who use the beaches and swim in Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
After heavy rainstorms, the city routinely is forced to dump raw sewage into 
the bay. Expensive projects are underway to halt the problem. 
</P>
<P>
There was no economic assessment contained in the report.

LAKERS WIN ROUGH ONE AT PHOENIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PHOENIX 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As remembrances of a hard-earned victory Friday night, the Lakers carried with 
them an inordinate number of battle scars. They nursed them without 
complaining, however, perhaps because a loss to the Phoenix Suns would have 
hurt considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson limped around the locker room with an ice bag attached to his 
hyperextended right knee. James Worthy had a nasty lump forming on his 
forehead, Orlando Woolridge a gash under his right eye and Michael Cooper 
untold bruises. Even Mark McNamara, who played all of four minutes, had an 
inflamed thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Laker casualties may have been heavy, but those were comparatively minor hurts 
to the punishment they doled out against Phoenix. The Lakers, playing one of 
their most aggressive and physically challenging games this season, 
administered a 103-99 beating to the Suns before 14,487 fans at the Veterans 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever pain the Lakers had to endure Friday night seemed worth the price. The 
Lakers' rare road victory at Phoenix improved their record to 56-17 and moved 
them three games ahead of the Detroit Pistons -- losers to Milwaukee -- in the 
loss column for the NBA's best record. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be a street fight," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "It was one 
of those big, big games we dug out. It's big with Detroit losing. But this 
thing is not over. We've got five more games on the road." 
</P>
<P>
True, but the Lakers like their chances of holding a three-game lead over the 
Pistons with nine to play. The incentive is home-court advantage throughout the 
playoffs. Judging by their comments, the Lakers aren't yet ready to declare 
that they have the best record in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be comfortable until we're 10 games up with nine to play," Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you crazy?" Cooper responded. "This isn't over. We definitely like our 
position right now, but we've still got tough games ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Few figure to be tougher than Friday's battle. Although neither team is known 
as a banger or physically imposing, such as Detroit and Philadelphia, the Suns 
and Lakers pounded on each other. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, despite making only 43% from the field and 61% from the 
free-throw line, held off repeated Sun comebacks thanks to accurate three-point 
shooting, a renewed emphasis on defense in the second half and a 45-35 
rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In beating the Suns for the third time in four games -- and the first time on 
the road in the regular season in two years -- the Lakers received a couple of 
injury scares. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:28 left in hte fourth quarter, Thompson came down awkwardly after 
grabbing a rebound. His leg buckled and Thompson collapsed to the floor. He 
left the court limping but later returned to action. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about it was that I didn't hear anything pop," Thompson said of 
his hyperextended right knee. "I knew what it was right away. You tend to 
overreact when you come down and your knee isn't there anymore. But I knew 
right away how bad it was." 
</P>
<P>
About three minutes later, Worthy grabbed his forehead and was doubled over 
after colliding with Tom Chambers. Worthy was not seriously hurt, but the 
Lakers were concerned that his jump shot might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
But Worthy, along with Byron Scott and others, came through with big plays when 
the Lakers needed them most. 
</P>
<P>
Although they made only 22 of 36 free throws, the Lakers made four important 
ones in the final 10 seconds to thwart Phoenix's last comeback hope. Scott sank 
two free throws with 10 seconds left for a four-point Laker lead, then after 
Kevin Johnson's layup with five seconds left, Worthy sank two free throws with 
four seconds to go to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very, very tough game," said Woolridge, sporting a cut under his 
right eye. "We just had to really get our defense going to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers led by only one point at halftime, but opened as much as a 13-point 
third-quarter lead. They did it by forcing Phoenix into 11 turnovers in the 
quarter. Although the Suns cut the margin to one point with 3:02 left in the 
game, the Lakers converted in their half-court offense and made most of their 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
As he has consistently done against the Suns this season, Worthy led the Lakers 
with 29 points. He made 10 of 20 shots, including an important jump shot with 
2:19 left and four free throws after that. Those last points came after Worthy 
and Chambers had collided. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson added 22 points and 10 assists, and Scott added 14 points. Cooper 
scored seven points and played exceptional defense against Sun point guard 
Kevin Johnson, who had 14 of his 24 points on free throws. Cooper's defense 
partially made up for his missing two free throws with 15 seconds left and the 
Lakers clinging to a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kevin Johnson's production, the Suns received 25 points from 
Chambers, 20 from Mark West and 14 from Eddie Johnson. Eddie Johnson sank two 
three-point shots in the second half, but missed a three-point attempt with 19 
seconds left that could have pulled the Suns to within one point. 
</P>
<P>
"We executed and played defense pretty well down the stretch," Magic Johnson 
said. "Anytime we get together, it's going to be a physical, tough game. Both 
teams know each other so well, nobody gives an inch. So, you've got to win it."

ANGELS FALL SHORT AGAIN; RADER NOT DISCOURAGED; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FINLEY STARTS OUT STRONG AND JOYNER CONTINUES HIS HOT HITTING, BUT 
THE DODGERS COME FROM BEHIND TO WIN FREEWAY SERIES OPENER, 5-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Angel Manager Doug Rader, there was the consolation that his team was in 
position to win Friday's game, just as it has been in position to win nearly 
every one of the five consecutive games it has lost. 
</P>
<P>
But while the Angels may be putting themselves into position to win, the 
Dodgers are actually winning, as they did in a come-from-behind, 5-4 victory 
before 47,555 at Anaheim Stadium in the opener of the Freeway Series. 
</P>
<P>
"This was encouraging," said Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda, whose team won for 
the fourth time in five games and improved its exhibition record to 6-4. "We 
hit the ball after the first few innings and we were able to put some runs on 
the board and then stop them. . . . We've played a lot in spring training. 
We've done a lot of hitting, a lot of running, everything. We're doing all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Angels are doing everything wrong. Wally Joyner was three for five 
with two runs batted in and has nine hits in his last 15 at-bats. After 
Joyner's RBI single in the third, Chili Davis drove in the second run of the 
inning with a sacrifice fly, and outfielder Dante Bichette hit a home run in 
the fourth, his third of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we've lost a bunch of games in a row and haven't won this week, but the 
bottom line is that the people we're counting on to do the job for us this year 
are doing it," said Rader, whose team is 6-8. "We've been in position to win 
virtually every one of these ballgames and that's all you can ask." 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks' single in the seventh off Mike Smithson scored Juan Samuel with 
the decisive run, capping a three-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Chuck Finley was impressive in the early going, retiring the 
first 10 batters he faced, most of them on ground balls. He worked his way out 
of a jam in the fourth, after he issued back-to-back walks to Willie Randolph 
and Brooks, but the Dodgers got to him for two runs in the fifth on RBI-singles 
by Samuel and Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with Finley's arm strength," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were pleased to be able to get to Finley at all, after the 
left-hander's strong start. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unhittable. He had good stuff," Brooks said. "He threw me one I never 
came close to hitting. I don't know what happened (as Finley approached the 
middle innings) but I know he had my number." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers on Fernando Valenzuela were encouraging to the Dodgers. The veteran 
left-hander pitched six innings, his longest outing of the spring, and gave up 
four runs and seven hits. He walked three and struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched against a good offensive team and we're encouraged," catcher Mike 
Scioscia said. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was even more encouraged by the performance of Samuel, who was two for 
four with an RBI in the fifth and a rally-sustaining stolen base in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy is the catalyst of our offense," Lasorda said. "If he gets on base, 
we'll score. He's a great base stealer. He gets on and steals a lot of bases. 
We're going to cut down on his strikeouts and he's done it so far." 
</P>
<P>
Smithson fed the Dodgers the fuel for their rally when he hit Jeff Hamilton 
with his first pitch. Hamilton went to third on Alfredo Griffin's double and 
scored on Samuel's roller up the middle. Griffin scored when second baseman 
Johnny Ray slipped while fielding Willie Randolph's bunt. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest play was hitting the leadoff man. That's what got them going," 
said Smithson, who has had rocky outings his last two times out. "I could use a 
little more time this spring. I've only thrown three innings, but that's no 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitcher Bob McClure has an inflamed left elbow and was told to rest for 
several days. McClure was examined bu Dr. Ron Glousman of the Kerlan-Jobe 
Clinic and will be re-examined Monday by Dr. Lewis Yocum, if necessary. McClure 
was forced to leave Thursday's exhibition game against the San Diego Padres in 
Palm Springs after complaining of tightness and pain in the elbow. He is being 
treated with anti-inflammatory medication. . . . Neither McClure nor third 
baseman Jack Howell (sprained left ankle) has been placed on the disabled list. 
The initial report on Howell, who injured his ankle Wednesday, was that he 
would be out seven to 10 days. However, he is hoping to play in Monday's season 
opener. "I don't want to start if there's a chance of injuring it worse," said 
Howell, who has stopped using crutches. "It's more important to be careful. On 
other hand, if it's just a little bit sore, I can play with that." Rader was 
pleased to hear of Howell's intentions. "I never contradict a man who says a 
brave thing," Rader said. "I don't know if it's a practical thing or not, but I 
think the world of him for saying it.". . . The Angels will announce their 
final cuts Sunday morning. . . .Catcher John Orton was voted the Fred Haney 
award as the Angels' outstanding spring training rookie. Orton is hitting .471 
with two home runs and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Rader said Donnie Hill "probably has got a little bit of an edge" over Rick 
Schu for the starting third baseman's job. "He's a switch-hitter, for one 
thing, and he's more than adequate at third base," Rader said. "I've seen him 
play third base a number of games, especially when he was with Chicago. The 
main thing is, he's a left-handed hitter against a right-handed pitcher 
(Seattle's Brian Holman) on opening day."

RED SOX FAR FROM INVINCIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN HORGAN, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 90th version of the Boston Red Sox came south with several questions, as 
befitting a third-place, .512 team. Who would play right field? Who would play 
first base? And, most notably, what to do about a pitching staff that has too 
few starters and too many closers? 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the engine begins to warm on the first season of the post-lockout era, 
the Red Sox have managed to solve only the first-base question. And even that 
is tenuous. Is the Billy Jo Robidoux-Carlos Quintana platoon system the answer 
until Mo Vaughn is ready? Maybe. Does Billy Buckner fit in? Probably for now, 
as part of the 27-man roster. But not after that. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the everyday positions this year will be filled with the 
same faces as last year, when the Red Sox collapsed behind the Toronto Blue 
Jays and Baltimore Orioles. Other than first base, the only sure difference is 
catcher, where Tony Pena takes over. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the pitching, or lack thereof. The starting rotation looks to 
be Roger Clemens, Mike Boddicker, John Dopson and a cast of thousands. The 
bullpen is strong, if chemically unbalanced because there is one short-man too 
many. There is only one answer -- Lee Smith has to go. General Manager Lou 
Gorman knows it. Unfortunately, so does the rest of baseball, so no one is 
offering enough by Gorman's standards. 
</P>
<P>
So, we have a team whose pitching is questionable, whose speed is non-existent 
(except for center fielder Ellis Burks) and whose primary power source last 
year, Nick Esasky, now plays in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
But there is good news for the Red Sox. Help is on the way. If spring training 
answered any question unequivocally, it is that the crop of youngsters steaming 
toward Fenway is better than even the organization thought. And even better, 
even the ever-cautious Red Sox management says it won't be long before Tim 
Naehring, Vaughn, Scott Cooper, Kevin Morton and Mickey Pina are in the bigs. 
</P>
<P>
If mixed properly with the current nucleus, the youngsters could make this 
franchise one of the more highly charged teams of the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
Does all of this mean the Red Sox are just playing out the year, waiting for 
the future to arrive, and thus are destined for third place again? Possibly. 
But in the equal-opportunity American League East -- where the prevailing 
mediocrity makes all things possible for all teams -- the Red Sox could even 
win it, barring serious injuries to key players. 
</P>
<P>
But don't count on it. Second place is more likely, behind the Blue Jays. Or 
third. Or fourth. Or some place even lower than that. 
</P>
<P>
The team expects to take 11 pitchers to start the season. Sure things are 
Clemens, Boddicker, Dopson, Wes Gardner, Greg Harris, Dennis Lamp, Rob Murphy, 
Jeff Reardon and Lee Smith. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Mike Rochford, Eric Hetzel, Dana Kiecker and Tom Bolton fighting 
for the last two spots. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the configuration, we're not talking the 1969 Baltimore Orioles here. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (17-11, 3.13) has had a monster spring, and seems driven to carry that 
into the regular season. Just don't ask him about it. The only question at this 
point is whether he will wear Jim Rice's No.14 Opening Day. Or maybe he'll opt 
for Al Nipper's No. 49. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Clemens comes Boddicker (15-11, 4.00) and Dopson (12-8, 3.99). Boddicker 
had a horrendous start last year, but finished strongly. He has pitched 
passably this spring, alternating between making people look foolish with his 
assortment of curveballs and off-speed stuff, and getting hit hard. He says he 
is ready, but a fast start is a must. Dopson remains an enigma. He was a 
surprise last year and Manager Joe Morgan is pleased with his spring. But, 
sometimes he just checks out mentally. And virtually every pitch is an 
adventure. Rich Gedman says he has no idea how Dopson's ball is going to break. 
"And he doesn't, either," Gedman said. 
</P>
<P>
After those three, life becomes a mystery. The Red Sox had hoped to use Smith 
as the trade material that would bring in a fourth starter, allowing them to 
use one of the current hired hands as a fifth starter. The lack of a trade has 
deep-sixed that plan, and the demise of Shane Rawley forced the team to hold an 
open audition for both jobs throughout the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The results were less than sterling. The only candidate who really pitched well 
each time out was rookie Dana Kiecker, and he has ane excellent chance of 
making the roster as a fifth starter or long man out of the bullpen. But as a 
fifth starter. The fourth slot will go by default to Gardner (3-7, 5.97). The 
Red Sox remain exasperated by Gardner's inability to pitch up to his potential. 
"It has to be Gardner right now," Gorman said. "He has the most experience and 
the best arm. We just have to hope he gets straightened out." Another 
possibility is left-handed Rochford, particularly early in the year against 
predominantly left-handed hitting teams like the Tigers.

MUSBURGER WAS JUST ON THE AIR TOO MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY FRAGER, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't think this many people have been happy about a guy losing a job since 
Richard Nixon resigned. 
</P>
<P>
This week's news of CBS' decision to end contract negotiations with Brent 
Musburger, making Monday's National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball 
title game his final assignment for the network, didn't seem to put the crimp 
in anyone's day. In fact, judging by some of the smiles in this office, it made 
several people's days. 
</P>
<P>
What was it about Musburger that engendered such antipathy? He doesn't project 
the noxious personality that Howard Cosell sometimes could. He doesn't fill air 
time with the inanities of Gary Bender. 
</P>
<P>
No, Musburger is a master in the studio setting, a highly efficient conduit of 
information. So what is there not to like about a conduit? 
</P>
<P>
But he was more than that -- which is part of the problem. Musburger the 
play-by-play man is not nearly so masterful. Certainly competent, Musburger too 
easily gets carried away. Every game is not Armageddon. In fact, every game is 
not necessarily the day's biggest game. 
</P>
<P>
That may have been the biggest worry baseball fans had about the prospect of 
Musburger as major-league announcer -- that he would Brent his spleen too much 
on the air, disturbing the pastoral pastime. 
</P>
<P>
The larger part of The Musburger Problem, however, was his constant presence. 
Week after week, game after game, there was Brent. Any of his faults thus 
became magnified. 
</P>
<P>
Consider two other criticisms of Musburger: his image as a shrill shill and his 
overuse of the first person singular. A typical Musburger introduction, so the 
criticism goes, would be something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"You are looking live, on CBS, at Anaheim Stadium, where, just moments from 
now, on CBS, the Los Angeles Rams, coming off a big win against the Atlanta 
Falcons, will meet Mike Ditka's Chicago Bears, on CBS. Mike told me a few 
minutes ago that his team is ready to go. I asked the Rams' John Robinson about 
that, and he told me, 'Brent, so is my team.' I just got off the phone with 
God, and He told me that we should have great weather for today's game, on 
CBS." 
</P>
<P>
Hyperbole aside, how unusual is it for a television announcer to promote his 
network's offerings? And is Musburger the only man with a microphone ever to 
trumpet himself in reporting quotes? 
</P>
<P>
It all goes back to being on the air so much. (Of course, for $1.75 million a 
year, he should have been on a lot.) As the song goes, little things mean a lot 
-- even when they shouldn't. Last fall, after Musburger took to wearing glasses 
during "The NFL Today," a CBS Sports publicist answered a call by saying she 
hoped I wasn't calling about Brent's glasses. Apparently, she had fielded more 
than a few calls from the press about the spectacles spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Musburger was let go because he apparently wanted to be before the 
camera more than CBS wanted. In essence, he lost his job because he wanted to 
work too much (try that one out on your boss). CBS wants to showcase Jim Nantz, 
Greg Gumbel and James Brown. Spread those assignments around. That way, nobody 
can get too annoyed about how Nantz combs his hair. 
</P>
<P>
Where will Musburger end up? There are lots of rumors, the best of which may be 
the one that places him with Turner Broadcasting. Sure, it's cable, but Turner 
has a good number of major-league properties -- the National Football League, 
National Basketball Association, Atlanta Braves, Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few other things going on at CBS, such at this weekend's Masters 
golf tournament. Remember, this is the golf tournament with hardly any 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
If you like ESPN's whip-around NCAA basketball tournament coverage, you'll love 
the way it's planning to cover baseball. The cable network's 171-game, 
regular-season schedule really will involve about 300 games because of regional 
coverage.

PLAYERS HEADED FOR NFL SHOULDN'T BE HIS CONCERN

<TEXT>

I found USC football Coach Larry Smith's concern regarding junior football 
players leaving school for jobs in the NFL interesting. May I respectfully 
suggest he need not worry about these young men, but rather he should concern 
himself with the large number of scholarship football players at USC who leave 
after their senior years, without degrees and without jobs?

LACK OF SUPER BOWLS NOT DICKERSON'S FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Murray is off the deep end again. I do not completely agree with the way 
Eric Dickerson handled his salary complaint against the Rams, but everyone 
knows that he was underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to knock Dickerson, go right ahead, but don't use the quarterback 
scenario to criticize him. Super Bowls are won the same way all other team 
sports are won -- with team efforts, not quarterbacks.

HE'S TIRED OF THEIR STERLING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 24, the Clippers got beat at home by 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
Their 11 points in the fourth quarter was the fewest points in any quarter this 
season. Their 79-point total was also a season low. 
</P>
<P>
In games elsewhere, three ex-Clippers totaled 134 points: 60 for Tom Chambers, 
40 for Terry Cummings, 34 for Ricky Pierce.

Mr. Sterling, some people have an undeserved reputation. You've earned yours.

METS' DAVEY JOHNSON WEATHERS THE STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when the facts say that New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson ought to be 
squirming in the heat, he says that the weather is just fine. "I'll tell you," 
he said, "this year I don't have any problems." 
</P>
<P>
You know how the weather stories are in the Florida papers: Whether it's sunny 
and 80 degrees or cloudy and a shivering 50, they tell you how nasty it is at 
home. Johnson is a Floridian who made his riches with Orlando real estate 
before Disney got there. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, Johnson was a lame-duck manager. This spring, he's 
manager by split decision. Last year -- now that was cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, we got a lot accomplished," he said. "Last year's situation could 
have dragged out two years and the problems could exist today." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult circumstance a manager has to deal with is the fading star 
who is convinced that he can still play. As a player, Johnson watched Earl 
Weaver agonize over having to decide that reliable Don Buford couldn't do it 
anymore. As a manager, Johnson had to deal with Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
That was "a strain," Johnson said. Carter thought that he should play even when 
he was hurt, and when Johnson wanted Hernandez in the lineup, he was often 
hurt. Everybody knew that those two stars were near the end of their time but 
the manager felt that he owed them a chance to buy more time. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they won 87 games and finished second, the Mets did not handle 
those problems with grace or maturity. Players crabbed about Carter, Hernandez 
and Gregg Jefferies, and the way Johnson handled them. And that was why General 
Manager Frank Cashen had to reject the corporate input that Johnson shouldn't 
manage this team this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have been disappointed (but) it wouldn't have killed me," Johnson said. 
But then he is quick to point out that this is his seventh season in the job 
and no Mets manager has ever had that tenure. "I know I'm the best man for the 
job as it is here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation suggests that, for the welfare of the manager, the Mets have to 
get off to a good start. "If I worry about that, I couldn't manage the way I 
always have," he said. "I've got to manage for the players and for the 
organization. If I manage for Davey Johnson, that's not good." 
</P>
<P>
His first required decision concerns his pitching staff. In spite of his degree 
in math, he can not divide six into five and make it come out happy. 
</P>
<P>
It's a comforting cliche to say that a team can't have too many pitchers. But 
that's true only when it comes out right. Johnson has to pick four starters for 
the early season and spread enough work for the others to be ready. It's 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
It's also uncomfortable. "They all know they're good pitchers; they all know 
they deserve to start," Johnson said. "They all know they can't all start. It's 
my job to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
There are questions that skeptics see before these pitchers can be listed with 
Lemon, Wynn, Garcia and Feller or Palmer, Cuellar, Dobson and McNally. 
</P>
<P>
Which Dwight Gooden is this one? Is Frank Viola to be judged by last season? Is 
Ron Darling better than the .500 pitcher he was last season? Is Sid Fernandez 
last year's Sid or the previous frustration? Is Bob Ojeda sound? 
</P>
<P>
At this point, David Cone looks like the best of this staff, but he is likely 
to be one of the odd men out because he's versatile. 
</P>
<P>
Not being so skeptical, all of them won't have bad years. No other team has 
that depth of quality pitching. 
</P>
<P>
But what about Darryl Strawberry? He's been outgoing and appears comfortable 
here. But it's a long season. "I feel good about Darryl," Johnson said. "He 
feels good about Darryl. If he's as happy all year, he'll be a joy to watch." 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the fascinating bits of this season. Does Strawberry, after his 
alcoholism treatment, recover to carry an unproven lineup? 
</P>
<P>
Where does the backbone come from? Vice President Al Harazin said he thinks 
that personalities will emerge that were submerged by Carter and Hernandez. But 
that kind of talk rankles Johnson. "Those guys were great for this club because 
they were great players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is something to be said for standup players in the clubhouse as well as 
on the field. Too often, last season's Mets said with their absence from the 
clubhouse: Don't blame me. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Jefferies? Seldom has a young player been treated with such 
distaste by his teammates as Jefferies was last season. Blame everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't handle it as well as I should have, the players didn't, and he 
didn't," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation on this team is closer to what it was in 1984, when Johnson came 
to manage and they had not yet won anything, than to the situation of last 
season. Johnson is at his best with young players; he understands the value of 
losing early in order to win late. 
</P>
<P>
He was afraid of Jefferies' ego being crushed if he was sent down last season. 
"I was not going to do that," Johnson said. "I had to help him get established 
at all cost." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies responded with a hopeful second half. Now there is Keith Miller, 
unopposed as center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a guy who came up and didn't make it while I've been 
managing this team," Johnson said. "I can name a lot of guys who came up with 
high expectations on other teams, were sent down and were crushed. One of my 
jobs is to establish players and get them to produce. 
</P>
<P>
"I may lose a battle along the way, but my way is going to win more in the long 
haul." 
</P>
<P>
It's such a worry-free time now. The way Johnson talks, the only thing way they 
can lose is with bad managing. "And you know," he said, "that's not going to 
happen."

FIGHT IS ONLY ATTACK ISLANDERS CAN MUSTER IN LOSS TO RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call it hockey. For 59 minutes and 58 seconds it was pretty darn good 
hockey. Then the definition got lost. 
</P>
<P>
Then the mostly benign and often amusing rivalry between the New York Rangers 
and the New York Islanders turned ugly. Nobody should be surprised if it stays 
ugly for the rest of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a physical game," said Chris Nilan, who had come off the ice with his 
Rangers jersey ripped into a V-neck and patches of skin missing from his 
knuckles. He plays that game. 
</P>
<P>
And for some of the people in Madison Square Garden Thursday night, it was just 
the sort of thing they liked. 
</P>
<P>
Blame Al Arbour, who sent his knuckles onto the ice to give a message with two 
seconds to play. "Disgraceful," said Rangers General Manager Neil Smith, who 
grew up in hockey as Arbour's protege. "I'm really disappointed in Al Arbour." 
</P>
<P>
Blame the Rangers' fans who stood and cheered and jeered as Pat LaFontaine lay 
motionless on the ice and then was wheeled off on a stretcher. Had they been in 
the corridor to see LaFontaine wheeled out, his head immobilized, a blanket up 
to his neck, his hand wiping at the corner of his eye, they still would have 
regarded him as an Islander to be despised. 
</P>
<P>
You just have to take them at their word. "Dig a hole and bury this pond scum," 
one of the fans in the snakepit of the blue seats said. If there was dissenting 
opinion, it wasn't heard. 
</P>
<P>
Blame hockey because it panders to those fans. 
</P>
<P>
And those fans should not be surprised if Bernie Nicholls, perhaps the best of 
the Rangers, is a target in Game 2 Friday. Nicholls certainly won't be 
surprised. In the heat of a baseball pennant race, if the best hitter on one 
team is drilled in the first game of the series, expect the best hitter on the 
other team to be turned upside down the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"If they think that was a dirty hit on Patty, I'd expect some guys to do 
something about it," Nicholls said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see the video," Arbour said. "If there was something there, we 
have long memories." 
</P>
<P>
What happened to LaFontaine when he was checked hard by James Patrick and 
immediately knocked over by Nilan is subject to interpretation. LaFontaine took 
a hard shoulder and forearm -- a hockey check, as they call it -- at the side 
of his head with 1:17 left in a 2-1 hockey game. The Rangers had double-teamed 
LaFontaine all game, beginning with Nilan's fist to LaFontaine's head in the 
opening minute. Nilan is thoroughly experienced in the role. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way the Devils eliminated the Islanders two years ago, the last time 
they were in the playoffs. LaFontaine doesn't get all that much help from his 
side. Rangers Coach Roger Neilson knew how that worked. The Rangers are the 
division champions; the Islanders barely made it to the playoffs. If the big 
guys could take the little guys out of the game early, there would be no 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had some really good hits early and then the big hit on 
LaFontaine," Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
There was this sequence of events. First Alan Kerr upended Nicholls at center 
ice while the puck was dead. Of course Kerr and Nicholls had tangled against 
the boards a few moments earlier. Nicholls said that he wasn't hit all that 
hard and had tried to act his way into a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
But no, he said, it hadn't been a clean check. "He was frustrated. That's the 
way he plays." 
</P>
<P>
Then LaFontaine was hit. "I don't think anybody likes to see somebody get 
hurt," Nicholls said. "It was a clean hit." 
</P>
<P>
"Take the body," Mark Janssens of the Rangers said, as if saying "Semper Fi, 
Mac" or reciting the pledge of allegiance. "This is a hockey game, isn't it? 
He's their team's key player. Each team is out to hit everybody." 
</P>
<P>
And so they did. With two seconds left on the clock and not much hope left in 
the game, the Islanders tried to hit everybody. At least those Islanders that 
Arbour sent out to play the last two seconds did. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end you know what those guys are out there for," Nicholls said. "Vukota 
and Baumgartner weren't out there to tie the score in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Mick Vukota and Ken Baumgartner are on the team more for their combativeness 
than for their hockey skills. "That's their job," Nicholls said. "They're 
trying to help their team. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it had to help their hockey team. They've got one of the best 
coaches, in my opinion, in the league. Why did he put them out there?" 
</P>
<P>
He was dripping with sarcasm. If the Rangers were going to take the body, then 
Arbour was going to have his players exact a price. Neilson was certain that 
he'd seen cause and effect. 
</P>
<P>
"If Al Arbour leaves the Islanders, I'm sure he'll be welcome in the Eastern 
League," Neilson said with keener sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, given his own history, there's little doubt whether Neilson would 
have done the same. He did as much with Toronto and Vancouver, trying to muscle 
Mike Bossy out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
In this case it was Arbour, who didn't have to resort to goons and bullies when 
he had the best talent in the league at his disposal. Other teams tried to draw 
the Islanders into brawling and the Islanders laughed and put the puck in the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
They felt good about themselves. They felt they could be above the muck and 
mire of the game because they were better. If somebody wanted to start 
something, they had guys who could handle it. 
</P>
<P>
This time Vukota went out to do a job. "He didn't go after anyone else," said 
the Rangers' Jeff Bloemberg, a conscientious objector. "He realized I was the 
only one out there who's not a fighter and knew I wouldn't retaliate and he 
took advantage of it. He came right after me." 
</P>
<P>
The hard fact was that the Islanders couldn't muster a real attack, couldn't 
put real pressure on Rangers goalie Mike Richter. He was bigger than anything 
they threw at him. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment about what happened at the end of the game," Brent Sutter said.

ORANGE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
BOTTOM OF THE ORDER ON TOP OF ITS GAME AS MAGNOLIA WINS

<P>
Orange League pitchers beware: Don't underestimate the bottom of Magnolia High 
School's batting order. 
</P>
<P>
The lower half of the Sentinels' lineup gave them all the runs they needed in 
an 8-2 victory over Western Friday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Phillips, the Sentinels' pitcher and No. 6 hitter, was two for three with 
a double and two runs batted in. John Straits, who bats seventh, was two for 
two with a triple and scored two runs. And No. 8 batter Mike Compean singled, 
drove in a run and scored another. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a fairly good hitting team," Magnolia Coach John Sharp said. "We don't 
have a lot of power, but we watch the strike zone and don't swing at bad 
pitches. That's half the battle right there." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, meanwhile, was winning the other half. He gave up four hits, all in 
the first two innings, and improved his record to 3-1. He struck out 13 and 
walked four before he was relieved by Jesse Carrow in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"Chad has a lot of colleges looking at him," Sharp said. "Stanford and the Air 
Force Academy have seen him play and the Cleveland Indians were out here 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Magnolia (5-6, 4-2 in league play) in the chase for the league 
lead. Robert LeGendre (2-1) took the loss for Western (5-5, 3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Western took a 1-0 lead in the first when Erik Dowell singled to right field, 
moved to second on a base hit to left by Ed Serrano and scored on Jeff 
Livingston's single to left-center. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers' lead held until the third inning, when Magnolia struck for two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Straits led off with a triple to right over Livingston's head. LeGendre then 
walked Compean. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Sandoval sacrificed to center, scoring Straits and moving Compean to 
second. Compean took third on a passed ball and scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels added two runs in the fourth on RBI singles by Straits and 
Compean and four more in the fifth for their second victory over Western this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In another Orange League game: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda 4, Anaheim 1 -- Pat Simec (3-2) pitched a one-hitter with 10 
strikeouts and four walks for host Brea (8-5-1, 3-2-1). David Geary had a 
single in the fifth for Anaheim's only hit. Brian Travaglia had three hits and 
scored three runs and Matt Selinske added two hits for Brea.

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kent Donnelly, who constantly strives for high marks, helped Foothill High 
School teach Santa Ana Valley another lesson Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly, a senior who has a 4.0 grade-point average, improved his record to 
5-0 by pitching the Knights to a 5-2 Century League victory at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights (8-4-1, 5-1-1 in league) have beaten Santa Ana Valley (5-8, 2-5) 
four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly, a hard-throwing right-hander, limited the Falcons to one hit and one 
run in five innings and helped himself with a run-scoring triple in the fourth. 
Jason Schwary pitched the final two innings for the save. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly, who has made an oral commitment to attend USC, struggled with his 
control. He walked eight and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little too wild," Foothill Coach Gerry Sedoo said. "He's had a little 
trouble with his control the last two outings. I think he's trying to do too 
much for the team. He is a good all-around player." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill took a three-run lead in the second after Clint Pearson led off with a 
single to left. Shawn Sousa bounced a line drive off Santa Ana Valley pitcher 
Jose Arroyo for an infield single and Mark Bablot walked to load the bases. Ron 
Kiino, the ninth hitter in the lineup, lined a 3-1 pitch to left to drive in 
two runs. Blaine Jones' bases-loaded infield single accounted for the third 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly belted a towering shot over the head of Scott Strong in right-center 
field for a triple, driving in Keith Baker. Donnelly scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
In other Century League games: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 8, Canyon 6 (9 innings) -- Jesse Rosas had a bases-loaded single for 
one run and Daniel Alvarez followed with two-run single to lead Santa Ana (5-8, 
2-5). Canyon scored once in the bottom of the ninth. Rosas (4-3) picked up the 
victory with five innings of relief, striking out five. Greg Tippin singled, 
doubled, tripled, scored twice and had two RBIs for Canyon (6-6-1, 5-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 3, El Modena 0 -- Todd Blyleven pitched a four-hitter with 10 
strikeouts and one walk for host Villa Park (7-5-1, 3-4). Alex Vicario stole 
home and the Spartans' other runs came on wild pitches. TOM BIRSCHBACH

MASTER'S MARTIN CHANGES SIDES, NOT RESULTS, AT PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Martin was recruited by The Master's College to hit baseballs, something 
he does particularly well. 
</P>
<P>
At Escondido High last year, Martin set a San Diego Section record with hits in 
12 consecutive at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine the horror of Mustang coaches when Martin jammed his left shoulder 
diving back to first base during a practice game last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to swing a bat without pain from the right side, Martin was forced, out 
of desperation, to try something new: batting left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't miss a beat. Martin, Master's starting third baseman, entered 
Friday's game against Biola batting .349. 
</P>
<P>
But with his shoulder feeling better, Martin couldn't resist the temptation to 
return to batting from the right side. 
</P>
<P>
He went 0 for 4. 
</P>
<P>
Masters at bat: Martin hasn't been the only hitting star for Master's, which 
has won nine of its past 11 games. The Mustangs (17-15) have a .316 batting 
average and senior Mark MacArthur is close to breaking his fifth career record 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur, from L. A. Baptist High, needs one more triple to tie the school 
mark of 10 set by Steve Souza from 1972-75. MacArthur already has records for 
hits, at-bats, runs scored and runs batted in. Coming into the season he had 
the standards for home runs, hit by pitches and assists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sheldon Sparks went 2 for 5 against Biola on Friday to extend his 
hitting streak to 17 games. He has raised his batting average from .250 to .362 
in the past month and leads the Mustangs with 17 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Johnson leads the team with a .398 batting average and has gone hitless 
in only two of 29 games. He also has played nearly flawlessly at second base 
with only three errors in 148 chances. 
</P>
<P>
No doubting Thomas: It seemed an idle boast at the time, but Moorpark softball 
Coach Will Thurston's preseason prediction of 25 wins for pitcher Robin Thomas 
is looking better all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a freshman from Newbury Park, has 16 of Moorpark's 17 wins this season, 
against only three losses. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad considering the last time Thomas pitched regularly was as a high school 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Thurston based his prognostication -- which was recorded in the team's media 
guide -- on what he had seen of Thomas when she was 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I first saw her pitch when I was at an opening ceremonies and she played on a 
14-and-under Bobby Sox team," Thurston said. "She ended up MVP and she pitched 
her team to a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
Thurston hopes for a similar feat -- a state title, perhaps? -- this season. 
Moorpark is 17-5 overall, 9-0 in Western State Conference play, has a 15-game 
WSC winning streak and is unbeaten in its past 46 conference games at home. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's third-place finish in the state tournament last season was the 
school's best. However, with the loss of ace pitcher De Dow, the Lady Raiders 
didn't figure to be as strong this season. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't have the mixture of pitches De did, and she's probably a tad 
slower," Thurston said. "But she has that attitude on the mound that you love 
your No. 1 pitcher to have -- 'Give me the ball and let's get it done.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thomas throws a drop and a rise to complement her out pitch -- a knuckle 
changeup. "Probably her No. 1 strength is that as a converted shortstop and 
second baseman, she fields her position very well," Thurston said. 
</P>
<P>
She also has plenty of support in surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Missy Cress was voted the WSC's Most Valuable Player last season, when 
first baseman Chris Singer was an all-conference selection and had a 
school-record 34 RBIs. Second baseman Audra Olive was a National Softball 
Coaches Assn. All-American and third baseman Rustie Stevens was a second-team 
all-state selection as an outfielder in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Two-liners: Trevor Wilson of UCLA and Cleveland High compares favorably as a 
college basketball player to the Lakers' A. C. Green, formerly of Oregon State. 
Wilson's strengths are defense and rebounding and, like Green, he should go 
late in the first round of the NBA draft . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Northridge seemed a lock for a berth in the Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. postseason tournament, but since then the 
Matadors have lost four in a row. Northridge, which hosts the WIVA tournament 
April 25-28, can still wrap up a bid next week by winning one of its two 
matches at Brigham Young . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Pierce College men's tennis team will play in Hawaii next week. Shouldn't 
every team have a coach like the Brahmas' Paul Xanthos, who owns a travel 
agency? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield finished with a 29-5 record and advanced to the NCAA 
Division II basketball championship game, where it lost to Kentucky Wesleyan, 
93-79. The only team to defeat the Roadrunners twice this season was -- 
surprise! -- Northridge (12-15), which defeated Bakersfield, 61-58 and 96-88 . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Washington delivered a one-two combination against Northridge when it 
hired Ran Railey, director of athletic fund-raising at CSUN, to a similar 
position. Railey's wife, Rocky, is CSUN's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
Training light: Spring practice, such as it was, concluded on Thursday for the 
Northridge football team. 
</P>
<P>
In accord with new NCAA limitations on practice time, the Matadors were allowed 
only 24 hours of training -- two hours a day, including meeting time, for 12 
days with no contact. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Bob Burt said he is not a supporter of the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to have spring football, then let's practice football," Burt 
said. "Football is a collision game and you play it with pads on. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line is really our only question mark and it's hard to tell a 
lot without pads. We have the makings of a decent offensive line, I think. But 
it's hard to tell how physical we are when nobody is hitting." 
</P>
<P>
If raw numbers are any indication, the Matadors figure to be improved on the 
line. CSUN had 12 linemen practicing compared to less than half that number 
last spring.

DIGEST: LORRAINE GIVES ORAL COMMITMENT TO STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Lorraine, a senior left-hander from Hart High, said Friday he has orally 
committed to play baseball for Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, 4-0 with four saves, an 0.51 earned-run average and 65 strikeouts in 
41 innings, also visited Cal, USC, Loyola Marymount and Arizona State. 
</P>

Stanford, which won consecutive national championships in 1987 and 1988, does 
not have a left-hander on its traveling squad, and Lorraine said he may start 
or relieve. Lorraine has a 3.75 grade-point average.

DAMEWORTH FACES TEST FROM MARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Maris gave up the chance of a lifetime so that he could prepare for the 
race of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The senior at White River High in Buckley, Wash., chose not to compete in the 
World Junior Cross-Country Championships on March 24 in France so as to ready 
himself for a run at Agoura's Bryan Dameworth in the 3,200-meter event at 
tonight's Arcadia Invitational at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
In their December confrontation at the Kinney national cross-country finals in 
San Diego, Maris (15 minutes 0.9 seconds) finished second to Dameworth 
(14:49.9) in what was a neck-and-neck battle until the final quarter-mile of 
the 5,000-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, a senior, leads the nation in the 1,500 (3:55.8); the 3,200 (9:01.2) 
and the indoor mile (4:13.1). He won the Arcadia 3,200 a year ago and has a 
personal best of 9:00.27. Maris is the No. 2 returnee in the nation with a 
1,600 mark of 4:10.7. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, however, believes Maris is No. 1 with his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big talker," said Dameworth, who was at the world junior cross-country 
trials in Seattle when Maris opted to forgo the championship race in Aix Les 
Bains, France. "He was saying, 'I'll see you at Arcadia.' I'm not going to 
start talking like him." 
</P>
<P>
The 3,200 also showcases the Nos. 3 and 4 returnees nationally in L. A. Wilson 
junior Martin Morales (9:06.46) and Camarillo senior Abe Valdez (9:07.0). 
Hoover's Eliazar Herrera has run 8:43.53 for 3,000 this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa freshman Marion Jones will adjust her starting blocks next to Muir's 
Inger Miller in the girls' invitational 100 meters. Miller, a senior, boasts 
the fastest time in the nation -- an 11.48 clocking at the Northridge/Alemany 
Invitational two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jones stormed 11.76 in finishing second to Miller at Cal State Northridge and 
ran a nation-leading 23.9 (converted) mark for 200 at Santa Barbara last week. 
</P>
<P>
Other top area entrants include Birmingham's Brian Gastelum (800 and 1,600), 
Fillmore's Nikki Shaw (1,600), Antelope Valley's Brock Chase (high jump), and 
Agoura's Deena Drossin (3,200). Quartz Hill triple jumper Gabe Higa, the 
state's No. 2 returnee, may miss the event due to leg-muscle cramps.

<P>
Melissa Thatcher pitched a perfect game to lead host Agoura (8-4, 2-0) to a 6-0 
Frontier League softball victory over Santa Clara on Friday. 
</P>

season, struck out 14 and allowed only one ball to be hit out of the infield in 
her second no-hitter of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The junior has five no-hitters in her Agoura career.

TORREY PINES HOPING TO LAND NEW COACH AND STAR QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palomar League is undergoing a small shake-up, but of all the new faces in 
the North County, the most notable could be a quarterback who would move to the 
area if Bob Davis accepts the head football coaching position at Torrey Pines 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, defensive coordinator at Palm Springs High, would bring with him son 
Chad, a 6-foot-2, 170-pound junior-to-be who is on a pace to break Todd 
Marinovich's national record of 9,182 yards passing set at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich is now at USC. Davis has thrown for 4,766 yards in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Davis was offered the Torrey Pines position on Thursday. He has an 85-56 
record in five previous head coaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
The offer to Davis came one day after San Dieguito, the other high school in 
the district, named Marty Albert of Los Alamos, N.M., as its head football 
coach. Albert replaced Dave Rudolph, who accepted the position in early March 
but resigned Monday for financial reasons involving the district's health 
benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the league, Mt. Carmel, which has the county's largest student 
enrollment, named Frank Andruski as its athletic director, a position that 
becomes effective after June graduation. He will replace Bob Speights, who will 
become an assistant principal at Rancho Bernardo High School, which opens in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Andruski was also the athletic director from 1980-84.

PADRES NEARLY SET FOR THE '90S;

BASEBALL: THEY WORK OUT AT HOME IN PREPARATION FOR FINAL EXHIBITION GAMES. ROB 
NELSON SAYS HE'LL STAY WITH ORGANIZATION AT LEAST THROUGH SEASON, EVEN IN 
MINORS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a little later than expected -- about a week because of the delay caused 
by the spring training lockout -- but the Padres returned to San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium Friday ready to begin their first regular season of the '90s, 
their fourth decade in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
It was 21 years ago Sunday -- April 8, 1969 -- that the Padres opened their 
first season with a 2-1 victory over Houston in San Diego Stadium. Ricky Bones, 
a top prospect cut earlier this spring by the Padres, couldn't possibly 
remember it. He was one day old. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, in front of virtually no one, the Padres took batting practice and 
played a six-inning intrasquad game that featured more jocularity than hits, 
runs and hanging-star plays. The Padres will play exhibition games against 
Seattle tonight at 7:05 and Sunday afternoon at 1:05. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter, taking his first swings in the stadium since a December trade from 
Cleveland, lined a home run off the facade behind the left-field wall off Mike 
Dunne in the first inning. Carter, who did not have the best of springs -- one 
hit in his past 11 at-bats -- was jokingly given the silent treatment from 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"The man waits for an intrasquad game to go deep," Gwynn ragged. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I made contact," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of day. Relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jack McKeon might have given the Padres the day off, but he wanted to 
give pitcher Andy Benes another start before the season opener Monday at Dodger 
Stadium. Benes, who allowed just two hits in six innings, said he's ready. 
</P>
<P>
In off-the-field developments, first baseman Rob Nelson said he signed a waiver 
Friday agreeing not to become a free agent, at least until the end of the 1990 
season, even if he is sent to the minors before then. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who cleared major league waivers Friday morning, could have chosen free 
agency if he was sent to the minors because it would have been his second 
outright option. He needed to decide by Friday, not May 1, when rosters must be 
reduced from 27 to 24 players. Nelson, who played in 42 games last season, is 
expected to be on the 27-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said he likely would not make roster decisions until after Sunday's 
final exhibition game against Seattle for the simple reasons he doesn't have to 
and wants to wait in case of injuries. McKeon also said Nelson, outfielder 
Shawn Abner and pitchers Steve Peters, Rafael Valdez and Dan Murphy are 
fighting for the final three spots. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
There are still more than 10,000 seats available for Tuesday night's home 
opener against the Dodgers at 7:05. Tickets for all Padre home games are 
available at Gate C at the stadium or through TeleSeat.

The pilot of "Secret Passions," the gay-oriented soap opera produced in Orange 
County, is scheduled to air in Los Angeles on Century Cable on April 27 at 9:30 
p.m., despite having already prompted a barrage of phone calls to the cable 
system. Jacqui Hyland, program coordinator for Los Angeles' largest cable 
system, said that even before Century committed to air the show, the company 
received calls both from "right-wing homophobics" who opposed the cablecast and 
advocates "insisting we were trying to prevent it from being aired."

A fountain sculpture by French artist Niki de Saint-Phalle was unveiled Friday 
in Brea Mall's Center Court as part of the city's Art in Public Places program. 
The 9 1/2-foot-tall painted polymer piece, "La Lune" (The Moon), is the 91st in 
the 15-year-old program. 
</P>
<P>
Saint-Phalle, 59, is a self-taught artist, illustrator and costume designer who 
created "happenings" and installations with sculptor Jean Tinguely during the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, which cost $140,000, was bought by Corporate Property Investors, 
owners of the mall, in compliance with city policy requiring all residential, 
commercial and industrial development projects with a building valuation above 
$500,000 to buy art for public display.

WHY A NEW LEVY SPARKED RIOTS IN LONDON AND IS BEING CALLED MARGARET THATCHER'S 
TITANIC.

<P>
The meeting of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet on Jan. 9, 1986, has 
been called one of the most dramatic in British history. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, undercut by his boss in his plan to save 
the ailing Westland helicopter firm, scooped up his papers and stormed out. A 
few hours later he resigned, triggering one of the most serious political 
crises of Thatcher's long career. 
</P>
<P>
Few recall that the next item on the Cabinet agenda that day was a proposal, 
warmly embraced by the prime minister, to change the way British citizens pay 
for such local services as schools, libraries, street lighting and garbage 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Now, four years later, the decision to levy a "poll tax" to pay for those 
services is causing far more turmoil than the Westland affair. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Gallup Poll indicated that Thatcher's popularity had fallen to 
the lowest level Gallup has ever recorded for a British prime minister. It 
found her Conservative Party trailing its archrival, Labor, by 24.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this slide, according to 96% of those questioned, is the 
so-called poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
With a 98-seat majority in Parliament and two years to go before there must be 
a general election, it would be as mistaken to write Thatcher off as it would 
be to regard as typical of her opposition the rioters who ransacked central 
London last weekend in an anti-poll tax demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
But political opponents of every stripe see the tax as a possibly crippling 
government error, and they are preparing to take advantage of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"More than at any time since Mrs. Thatcher took office in 1979 (the 
Conservative Party) has its back to the wall," the strongly pro-government 
Daily Telegraph commented Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Worcester, head of the MORI polling organization, observed: "The 
Conservative Party is seen as divided, with an unpopular leader and unpopular 
policies, and people are worn out with them. The poll tax is really a symbol -- 
of Thatcher not listening, not understanding, not trying to understand how 
ordinary people react." 
</P>
<P>
As people in England and Wales began receiving poll tax assessment notices in 
the mail this week, a common response was that "it's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
In Scotland, the system went into effect last year, and about a third of the 
tax bills have gone unpaid there. 
</P>
<P>
David Griffiths, vice chairman of a fast-growing group that calls itself the 
Anti-Poll Tax Federation, said: "It robs the poorest people for the benefit of 
the richest. The vast majority of people feel a terrible injustice is being 
done to them." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the arguments in favor of abandoning the old property tax 
system was that the new approach would be more equitable. Advocates of change 
argued that it was not right that a widow living alone in her own house had to 
pay as much in local property taxes as the household next door with five 
working adults. Some people paid nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
The answer was the poll tax -- the "community charge," it is called officially 
-- which replaces the property tax with a flat levy on each of Britain's 35 
million or so adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were enthusiastic about the change because they saw political 
advantage in it. They thought that if voters were made to realize the cost of 
local services through a highly visible poll tax, as distinguished from the 
largely hidden property tax, they would reject Labor Party members of local 
councils and replace them with tight-fisted Conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few naysayers. A Conservative reform group warned last summer that 
the change "has all the makings of a disaster." And it went on to say: "The 
poll tax is fair only in the sense that the Black Death was fair. It is 
indiscriminate, striking at young and old, rich and poor, employed and 
unemployed alike." 
</P>
<P>
But the critics were overruled, even when they urged that the new system be 
introduced gradually, over a period of several years. 
</P>
<P>
The tax bills going out now vary from place to place. Assessments range from 
the equivalent of about $250 an adult to $950, depending on the local 
government's other sources of income -- business taxes and central-government 
grants, for example -- as well as the relative efficiency of the local council. 
The average assessment is about $575. 
</P>
<P>
There are a handful of exemptions -- foreign diplomats living here and members 
of some religious orders, for example, do not have to pay the tax. There is 
also a scale of percentage reductions for people living on reduced incomes, 
including pensioners, persons on welfare and students. Thus, nearly everyone 
has to pay something and most have to pay the full assessments for their areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to be popular when you're asking 17 million additional people to 
pay a tax," a Thatcher confidant said, referring to the impact of the change. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to it than that. The government calculated that as many as 
60% of all households would be better off under the poll tax. Significantly, 
that would include the majority of the homeowners, who make up a key 
Conservative constituency. 
</P>
<P>
But someone's arithmetic was faulty. According to a House of Commons study, 73% 
of the adults in England and Wales will be worse off under the new system. The 
study said fewer than 5 million households will gain under the plan against 
more than 14 million that will lose, despite a system of "safety net" rebates. 
</P>
<P>
For small businessman Keith Packham, in suburban Wimbledon, the new system 
means that he and his wife owe the equivalent of nearly $1,200 in poll taxes, 
compared to the $825 they paid last year in property tax. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that some local councils took advantage of the change to 
increase spending, knowing they could blame the inevitable result on the 
central government. But the central authorities were also at fault. In 
projecting local government costs, for example, they forecast inflation at 4% 
instead of the actual 8%. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the average poll tax is a third higher than it was projected to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, many of Britain's wealthiest citizens are getting the greatest 
benefit from the new tax system. For example, the head of the Conservative 
local council in the Westminster section of London will pay one of the lowest 
poll taxes in the country, the equivalent of about $300. This represents a 
savings of many thousands of dollars compared to what she paid in property 
taxes on her penthouse overlooking Hyde Park. 
</P>
<P>
The injustice of it so bothered 72-year-old Sid Tierney, a retired shop steward 
in Coventry, near Birmingham, that even though he stands to benefit from the 
change he is campaigning against it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we're going back to the Dickens days," Tierney said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said the system is hardest on young working-class families like that of his 
daughter and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"They've shifted the unfairness from one group of people to another group," he 
said. "It's so evil I've got to oppose it. And I'm not going to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Travers, director of research for the Greater London Group of the London 
School of Economics and a poll tax expert, said: "The fact is that the heaviest 
losers are those who live in small houses and flats. The old rates were levied 
based on the rental value of a property, so the bigger the house, the bigger 
the rates." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of a small flat in depressed northern England may have paid only $300 
or so in property tax, but the poll tax for him and his wife could be triple 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The government has tried in a number of ways to make the poll tax more 
palatable, in one instance putting a maximum on what certain local councils may 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say there will have to be more changes in the system next year, but 
they still support the basic idea, and have announced that they will campaign 
for forthcoming local elections under the banner "Conservative Councils Cost 
You Less!" 
</P>
<P>
"A desperate piece of cheek," Daily Telegraph columnist Ferdinand Mount 
responded. "It cannot be emphasized too strongly that this is not simply an 
unpopular tax; it is a rotten piece of legislation, vilely expensive to 
administer and likely to clutter up the courts with non-payers in arrears for 
years to come." 
</P>
<P>
People who refuse to pay may see their wages attached and their personal goods 
confiscated. They may even be sent to jail for up to three months. 
</P>
<P>
The issue promises to be a lightning rod for anti-Thatcher and anti-government 
sentiment later this month as the first poll tax installment payments come due 
and the boycott movement gets under way in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be a deathblow with a sword," anti-poll tax campaigner Griffiths said 
of the victory he expects to win. "It'll be more like we suffocate it." 
</P>
<P>
But there will be no compromise, he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
"We want (the tax) repealed, nothing less," he said. "We want it off the books 
now. . . . We say that if she doesn't withdraw the tax, this will be her 
Titanic. And we hope the captain will go down with the ship."

CITY HALL IS BIGGEST DRAIN ON L.A.'S SUPPLY OF WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the fourth year of a statewide drought unfolds, Los Angeles' biggest water 
user -- the city government itself -- is consuming more than ever, and two 
major city departments are violating an emergency water conservation law 
adopted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Water and Power records show that water use by city agencies has 
climbed by about 1.3% -- or 104 million gallons of water a year -- since 1986 
when Mayor Tom Bradley first asked for the public's help in reducing 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Overall water use in Los Angeles has dropped by an estimated 4% to 8% during 
the same period, according to DWP figures. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Mayor Bradley called on all citizens to increase their conservation 
to 10% compared to usage four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This week he sent a memo to all city departments telling officials that "it is 
the city of Los Angeles' responsibility to set a good example for residents," 
and he asked each of them to find ways to cut their usage by the same 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The city government of Los Angeles is the largest water consumer in the region, 
but officials acknowledge that they do not have a handle on water use by the 
hundreds of city facilities. In response to a Times inquiry, it took five days 
for officials to determine how much water was being used by city departments. 
</P>
<P>
DWP figures show that three departments -- Recreation and Parks, the Housing 
Authority and DWP Power Generation -- are individually ranked among the top 10 
water users in the city, along with UCLA, Caltrans and Anheuser-Busch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and other city officials said cutting water use will be difficult for 
many city departments. 
</P>
<P>
"Patterns are hard to break," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the DWP's own water division -- which posted a 29% increase in its water 
consumption during the past three years -- is unsure just how to cut use. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said most of the water increase was for landscaping at a new 
filtration facility in the San Fernando Valley. "(During) the first year or two 
of this drought-tolerant landscaping, you need to apply a fair amount of 
water," said Henry Venegas, assistant director of water engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"Asking our employees to not go to the bathroom or not take a drink of water is 
not in the cards," Venegas added. 
</P>
<P>
Like the DWP, a number of city departments said their increased water 
consumption is the result of expansion of services, staff and facilities. And 
many agencies -- such as the Recreation and Parks and General Services 
departments -- have taken important steps to control their water use. 
</P>
<P>
But the efforts of others appear to have fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Department of Airports official proudly explained that in 
response to Bradley's call, the department is hosing down sidewalks once a week 
instead of three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
However, it has been illegal to wash down sidewalks, parking lots or other hard 
surfaces in the city for the past two years. Under Phase 1 of the city's 
emergency water conservation ordinance, it also is illegal to serve water in 
restaurants except on request, or to operate decorative fountains that do not 
recycle water. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't understand that," said Clifton Moore, executive director of the 
Department of Airports. "Well, then we'll cut it down to zero." 
</P>
<P>
James Hadaway, general manager of the Recreation and Parks Department, said his 
crews have cut hosing of tennis and basketball courts from once a week to once 
a month. "We view it as a safety issue," said Hadaway about the continued 
hosing in the face of the ban. "We don't feel we are in violation." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the DWP, which enforces the conservation ordinance, said they have 
not received any complaints about the two departments but have asked their 
staff to look into the matter. The law calls for sending warning letters to 
offenders for the first two violations, installation of a flow restricter for 
the third violation and discontinued service for a fourth violation. To date, 
no one has received more than a second warning letter. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and other city officials acknowledge that they do not know how much 
water is used by individual city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
It would take weeks, officials said, to come up with water consumption figures 
for individual facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the City Council ordered the chief administrative office to 
design a computer program to provide such information. Officials say it will 
take at least another year to finish the program. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the situation, Mayor Bradley said this week, "They 
have a lot to do. Sometimes it takes an extra push." Earlier this week, Bradley 
had asked Chief Administrative Officer Kieth Comrie to make the project "a top 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
Facilities managers told The Times that without that information they cannot 
gauge their consumption or the effectiveness of their conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that anyone knows how many water meters we have," Recreation and 
Parks' Hadaway said. "I'm serious." 
</P>
<P>
His department is one of those that have adopted water conservation measures, 
such as water sensors and high-technology irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
The park department's water usage has gone up by about 8% during the last three 
years, which Hadaway said is most likely because of new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At the Department of Airports, usage has gone up by 18.5%. Moore said it was 
probably because of an increase in business and the opening of a new terminal. 
Department records show that the number of passengers went up by just 8.9%. 
Moore said he could ask his engineers to explain the water use increase but it 
could take days or weeks to get an answer. 
</P>
<P>
City departments showing a decrease in water use also have been unaware for 
years of their consumption levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Sanitation showed the biggest drop in use, according to DWP 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazing," said bureau Director Del Biagi when told that his department cut 
water use by 42% from fiscal 1986-87 to fiscal 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea why," he said. "We're not doing anything different that I know 
of. I can only assume they've moved the payment from our department to some 
other department. . . . I wish I had a great story to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the consumption increase, the city has taken steps to cut water use. 
</P>
<P>
The General Services Department has installed low-flush valves on 2,572 toilets 
and 726 shower heads at 850 city facilities, including police and fire 
stations, libraries and City Hall. Officials said that should save 46 million 
gallons a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Airports has replaced fixtures in 100 restrooms and has a 
water recycling system for its carwash. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation and Parks moved most of its automated watering to nighttime, began 
using reclaimed sewage water to irrigate golf courses in Griffith Park and 
stopped using water in ponds that do not recycle water -- such as the casting 
pond in Cheviot Hills Park. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Fire Chief Donald Manning said firefighters will conduct 
training drills without water. Manning also ordered that water for testing fire 
hoses be taken from park lakes and pumped back into those lakes whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department is acutely aware of its responsibility to conserve water 
due to the critical dependence it plays in saving lives and property in an 
emergency," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said all departments will save more water. "They'll get the message 
from the mayor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Bradley instructed the DWP to dispatch audit teams to help city 
departments adopt water-saving measures.

GAO SAYS S&amp;L COST COULD RISE TO $500 BILLION 
</P>

<P>
The savings and loan bailout, already pegged as the most expensive financial 
debacle in the nation's history, will cost at least $325 billion and could cost 
as much as $500 billion over the next 30 or 40 years, the General Accounting 
Office told Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The $325-billion estimate by the auditing arm of Congress is $68 billion higher 
than a GAO estimate last summer and is still "subject to significant change" if 
optimistic Bush Administration economic assumptions of steady growth and 
declining interest rates do not pan out, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher 
told the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
If those assumptions prove wrong and the economy stumbles, the outcome could be 
far worse, Bowsher told the few senators who showed up at the hearing. "It 
could easily go to $400 billion if more savings and loans fail and their asset 
base proves to be as bad as it has in many cases," Bowsher said. "If there is a 
recession, it could be as high as $500 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher seemed to take a morbid sort of pleasure in the magnitude of the 
eventual cost to the economy, noting at one point that it "would be bigger than 
New York, bigger than Lockheed, bigger than all the bailouts we've had put 
together." Warming up, he said: "It would be bigger than the Marshall Plan. It 
would be bigger than the defense budget." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even though the S&amp;L legislation contemplated that part of the 
bailout costs would be covered by higher deposit insurance premiums paid by the 
thrift industry and by the sale of assets held as collateral for soured loans, 
most of the added cost would be borne directly by taxpayers, Bowsher said. "The 
(thrift) industry is deteriorating badly. Most of these add-on numbers are 
going to be taxpayer money." 
</P>
<P>
But Bowsher said he could not estimate how much of the added cost would be 
incurred during the next few years. Fifty-billion dollars has already been 
authorized under the bailout legislation to cover the operations of the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the new government entity created to close down 
insolvent thrifts, sell their assets and pay their depositors. 
</P>
<P>
He called on Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who is administering the bailout, to 
"develop proposals to provide the additional funds." And he recommended that 
twice a year the Resolution Trust Corp. and the FDIC give Congress updated 
estimates of cash needs, costs and current income so the progress of the 
bailout can be steadily tracked. 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher's report made it clear, however, that about half of the estimated $68 
billion in additional costs probably will be incurred during the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the cost of the rushed closure of failing thrifts arranged by the 
now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in the closing weeks of 
1988 would cost $68 billion instead of the $56 billion originally earmarked. 
The total, including the extra $12 billion, would have to be paid by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the $50 billion set aside for Resolution Trust Corp. operations 
through 1992 would have to be augmented by $13 billion. And, because it is 
running up administrative expenses of $1.6 billion a year, the GAO estimates 
that the trust corporation, which is supposed to go out of business at the end 
of 1996, would cost an additional $10 billion by that date to pay for staff, 
lawyers and administrative support. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $33 billion of the overrun could presumably be spread out over a 
longer period. The biggest single added expense is $28 billion in extra 
interest paid on the working capital that the Resolution Trust Corp. borrows to 
liquidate the failed thrifts and buy up their assets. Many of those borrowings 
are long-term, and the interest payments would be stretched out over the 
nominal 33 years of the whole bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO tacked on another $5 billion to the interest cost of the $9.5 billion 
in off-budget Resolution Funding Corp. bonds that have been issued so far. The 
added interest results from the decision to stretch the redemption term on the 
bonds a decade beyond GAO's original assumption, to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report, although it had been expected to reflect substantially higher 
costs for the huge bailout, was nevertheless greeted with cries of anguish by 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), Bob Graham 
(D-Fla.) and Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), the only committee members present. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle expressed great interest in Bowsher's observation that Seidman, in 
previous public testimony, had noted that "60% of Resolution Trust 
Corp.-controlled institutions have been victimized by serious criminal 
activity" and that about 1,200 criminal referrals have already been passed on 
to the Justice Department for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle wanted to know if any additional criminal activity could be traced to 
the rush of "year-end deals" in 1988, but Assistant Comptroller General Richard 
L. Fogel, who accompanied Bowsher to the committee, said the audit of those 
activities had so far found none. Any criminal activity relating to the thrifts 
involved in those deals seems to have originated in the management of the 
thrifts themselves, not in the FSLIC stampede to close them. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle said he would call on the Administration to come up with a funding plan 
for the whole program at a hearing he intends to call next month. 
</P>
<P>
Graham declared Bowsher's report a "devastating statement" that "should be a 
call to arms for all people involved, from the Administration to Congress to 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
"We've pretty much spent the peace dividend here," Pressler observed. 
</P>
<P>
In reply to Pressler, Bowsher repeated the oft-stated observation that any 
further delay in liquidating failed thrifts now in receivership would drive up 
the costs still more. Over the last 14 months, regulators have seized 403 
institutions but have disposed of only 52. 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration of the point, Bowsher said his accountants estimated that, 
instead of the now-predicted $325 billion, the multiyear liquidation and 
bailout process would cost only $140 billion in "current value" if the entire 
expense of the operation could be carried in the 1991 budget. That would about 
double the deficit projected for the year.

BUSH MAY BAN OIL DRILLING OFF EVERGLADES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE PRESIDENT WILL ANNOUNCE A NEW POLICY FOR SENSITIVE AREAS. IT 
COULD AFFECT TWO LARGE SITES OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush suggested Friday that he has decided to ban for the foreseeable 
future oil drilling and exploration off the coast of Florida near the 
Everglades because of the environmental sensitivity of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I know enough about the Everglades and have been briefed enough on the 
environment of the Everglades to know that the ecological balance is highly 
sensitive," he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He added that he 
plans to announce an offshore drilling policy "that prohibits drilling in 
certain highly sensitive areas." 
</P>
<P>
The President's comments were the strongest hint of his plans concerning three 
huge areas of the Outer Continental Shelf where he suspended preparations for 
leasing in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lease sale area southwest of the Everglades, the suspension 
covered two areas of the Outer Continental Shelf along two-thirds of the 
California coastline. 
</P>
<P>
In January, an intergovernmental task force sent Bush a secret 200-page report 
detailing the environmental and economic impacts of drilling in the three areas 
and his options for offshore exploration and drilling. There still has been no 
indication of when he intends to announce his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said that a total ban on offshore drilling is not being considered, 
but he and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who was chairman of the task 
force, have promised that drilling will not be permitted in areas that have 
special ecological sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the task force review, knowledgeable sources have 
predicted that the area off the southern tip of Florida was the most likely of 
the three to be given long-term protection, because of the sensitivity of the 
Everglades as well as the already-threatened coral formations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
As in California, Florida residents express strong sentiment against drilling 
offshore, and Lujan several weeks ago suggested that the state of Florida might 
wish to buy back 73 federal leases already granted off its shores. Discussions 
on the issue are now under way between state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no mention of two California lease sales on which he suspended 
activity pending his task force study. But Sen. Pete Wilson, whom the President 
supports in the California gubernatorial campaign, has sided with 
environmentalists in opposing drilling on federal property off the state's 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did reiterate his position that an outright ban on offshore drilling is 
not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved in my part of the country that offshore drilling can be 
done compatibly with the environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is there shouldn't be a permanent ban on offshore drilling because 
then I would be compelled to ask the question: 'Where do we get the energy to 
keep this country going and to keep the working man and woman at work and heat 
the homes?' "

3 DIE, 21 HURT IN MIAMI BEACH HOTEL FIRE

<P>
Frantic tenants jumped from their windows or groped through smoky hallways as a 
fire destroyed a three-story residential hotel Friday, killing at least three 
people and injuring 21 others. 
</P>
<P>
At least nine residents were unaccounted for in the three-alarm blaze, which 
broke out before dawn at the Fontana Hotel north of the trendy Art Deco 
district, Fire Chief Branaird Dorris said. But officials said they had no 
evidence that those people were trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the estimated 100 residents are retirees, and some had to flee without 
their medication or hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible fire. I don't know how to describe this when you have multiple 
deaths and you have total destruction of a building," Assistant Fire Chief John 
Reed said. "I can't even think of the proper word to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Teixeira, a 27-year-old Brazilian, was awakened in his room by a 
frightened resident. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this guy running in the hall, shouting: 'Fire! Fire! Big! Big!' " 
Teixeira said. 
</P>
<P>
Two women and a man were killed, and fire officials presumed they were on a 
list of 12 people still missing. Twenty-one people were treated for smoke 
inhalation at various hospitals. Some were hospitalized and others were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"There's reason to believe that the number of dead may grow" because many of 
the missing lived in the most heavily damaged section of the hotel, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
After rescue efforts ended Friday, police and fire officials, state fire 
marshals and a special federal fire investigation team set up a meeting for 
today to determine how to pursue the search. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Alex Daoud said the intensity of the 3 a.m. fire led investigators to 
suspect arson, but Detective Jim Hyde said no evidence of arson had been found. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants reported a water leak, raising the possibility of an electrical short, 
Chief Dorris said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the fire started near an elevator shaft at the front of the 
102-room hotel, and Hyde said two of the bodies were found in the lobby area. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was choking," said Rose Waller, an elderly woman who made her way out 
with three neighbors but lost her medication. "I couldn't see because already 
the smoke came into my room. I really couldn't see anything." 
</P>
<P>
Residents fled in nightclothes, robes or whatever they could grab, while 
members of a Romanian immigrant family that owns the white stucco hotel knocked 
on doors to alert everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran upstairs and got people out. I broke down a door with my shoulder to get 
somebody out," said Olimpia Mihai, a member of the family. "It happened so 
quick -- half a minute and I couldn't see anything. I'm still in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Karmiller, 87, said she walked down from the third floor by hanging on to 
the banister, fleeing so quickly that she left without her dentures, hearing 
aid and cane. 
</P>
<P>
"She grabbed my hand and helped me out," said Jewel Mirsky, 76, who escaped 
with Karmiller. "It was all black. We felt the steps very haltingly. I heard 
the noise, and the siren went off like mad. The smoke was very bitter." 
</P>
<P>
Second-floor resident Joe Marcello, 32, who has limped since suffering a broken 
back two years ago, tried to go down the hall but choked on the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to fear for my life. I got scared," he said. "I thought: 'I'm going 
to die in here. How am I going to get out?' I'm already crippled. I just busted 
out the window and I hung from the second floor and I dropped down about 15 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
The Fontana was built in 1951 and complied with a 3-year-old ordinance 
requiring electric smoke alarms in each room, Reed, the assistant fire chief, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The only major violation in the most recent city fire inspection last September 
was battery-powered alarms, which were replaced, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was not equipped with sprinklers, which are not required by state law 
until October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross took in 121 people from the Fontana and the adjacent 
Prince Michael Hotel at a nearby shelter.

CHEMICAL SPRAYED ON PRICELESS REMBRANDT PAINTING; MAN HELD

An unemployed man, described by police as confused, sprayed Rembrandt's famous 
painting "The Night Watch" with an unidentified chemical Friday, but museum 
officials said damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second attack on the priceless art work in nearly 15 years, and the 
third this century. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch television said the spray was concentrated sulfuric acid, but museum 
officials would not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, a museum guard applied a neutralizing agent, and 
the damage to the 1642 masterpiece appeared limited to surface veneer, said 
Piet van Thiel, the Rijkmuseum's director of paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Museum guards seized the attacker and handed him over to police, according to 
another museum official. The painting is guarded round-the-clock by an unarmed 
security company worker. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not know what prompted the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Museum spokesman Klaas Wilting said the 31-year-old suspect is a Dutch national 
from The Hague. The man was not identified by name in line with police policy 
and is being held on suspicion of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"He is confused and not telling us anything at the moment," Wilting said 
shortly after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Van Thiel said the painting will be taken to a secret location for restoration 
but would probably be on display again in about two weeks. He said a new veneer 
layer would take several months to dry. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were no plans to put the painting, which yearly attracts hundreds 
of thousands of visitors from around the world, behind a protective shield. 
</P>
<P>
"The Night Watch" measures 12 feet by 14.5 feet and shows a gathering of 
17th-Century militiamen. It is considered a prime example of Rembrandt's 
skilled handling of light and dark.

PALESTINIAN GUERRILLAS SAY THEY WILL RELEASE 3 EUROPEAN HOSTAGES

Palestinian radicals led by Abu Nidal, one of the world's most notorious 
guerrillas, said Friday that they will free three European hostages in response 
to an appeal by Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source told Reuters that Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 31, her 
Belgian boyfriend Fernand Houtekins, 42, and their baby Sony, who was born in 
captivity, will be released in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to announce that our group has agreed to respond to the appeal of 
leader Moammar Kadafi," said Walid Khaled, spokesman for Abu Nidal's 
Revolutionary Council of Fatah, in a statement released in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kadafi had urged Muslims to adhere to the "noble Islamic values 
which affirm the honor and humanity of man and the non-taking of innocent 
hostages." 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian statement left unclear the fate of four Belgians, who were 
kidnaped with Valente and Houtekins in November, 1987, from a yacht in the 
Mediterranean off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. Earlier, the organization 
had said it was trying to free all the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also did not mention another baby reportedly born to Valente and 
Houtekins a few months ago. Sony was born about two years ago. In December, 
1988, the kidnapers freed two other children of Valente who had been seized 
from the boat. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the kidnaping, the Palestinian group accused the hostages of 
being Jews spying for Israel. However, friends said they were Roman Catholics 
on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages are believed to be held either in Lebanon or Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Council of Fatah is thought to be behind a string of attacks 
against Israelis, Europeans and Persian Gulf Arab states. In one of their most 
violent attacks, Abu Nidal's guerrillas killed 16 people at the Rome and Vienna 
airports in 1985.

LATVIA COMMUNIST PARTY MAY SPLIT OVER INDEPENDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: A CONGRESS IN THE BALTIC REPUBLIC OPENS WITH A PLEA FOR A 
COMPROMISE ON THE ISSUE OF SECESSION.

<P>
The Latvian Communist Party, like the Communist parties in the neighboring 
Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania and Estonia, is heading for a split this 
weekend between members wanting immediate independence and others remaining 
loyal to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Janis Vagris, the first secretary of the Latvian party, opened a party congress 
on Friday with a plea for a compromise that would make independence a long-term 
goal but focus first on economic development and greater autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
"The real political independence of Latvia is possible only when its economic 
independence is guaranteed," Vagris told the congress in Riga, the Latvian 
capital. "However, today in Latvia, there is not an economic structure 
appropriate to a sovereign state. 
</P>
<P>
"Independence," he said, "is a word that should not be pronounced too loudly. . 
. . This will take much time." 
</P>
<P>
Vagris argued that the restoration of Latvia's sovereignty was not a goal for 
its own sake but a means of improving life in the republic. For that reason, he 
said, the party should support the concept of "a sovereign Latvia as part of 
the union of independent socialist states" envisioned by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in place of today's highly centralized Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood in the congress after a day of debate was not for compromise. A 
radical minority argued passionately for immediate moves toward independence, 
conservatives urged with equal vigor that Latvia remain within the Soviet 
Union, and moderates, forming a third faction under Vagris, called for a 
compromise -- but with little prospect of acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Even conservatives acknowledged the probability that the party would split by 
the end of the congress. "I am sorry about it, but I fear that a split is 
inevitable," Arnold Lautsens, the Riga party leader, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives moved Friday to show that they would fight any attempt at 
secession. The Riga city party committee, which is controlled by party 
conservatives, closed the local Communist newspaper for taking too radical a 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Anda Anspoka, a spokeswoman for the Popular Front, which has planned an 
independence campaign for May, said she and other observers saw no real basis 
for holding the party together. 
</P>
<P>
Before the congress opened, party radicals, claiming a third of the 791 
delegates, had warned that they would form their own independent party if 
others failed to support their program for Latvia's secession from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try to put through our position on an independent Latvian course and 
an independent Latvia state," Ivars Endzins, a leader of the radical faction, 
said. "If they do not accept it, there is hardly any reason to continue working 
within this party." 
</P>
<P>
Vagris warned the party that it has to adjust to participate in Latvia's 
rapidly emerging multi-party political system and to meet the challenge posed 
by the Latvian Popular Front, whose grass-roots support greatly exceeds the 
party's membership of 177,000 and which recently won a majority of the seats in 
the Latvian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present stage, the Popular Front is the most influential political 
organization in the republic," Vagris said. "This is a reality that the 
Communist Party of Latvia cannot ignore." 
</P>
<P>
Endzins said the party, if it hopes to remain representative of Latvians and 
politically relevant, must reflect the rising separatist sentiments in the 
republic of 2.5 million people, slightly more than half of whom are ethnic 
Latvians. Even before Vagris spoke, the radicals said they would hold a 
founding conference for an independent party next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Popular Front and other pro-independence groups in recent elections 
won all but one of the seats needed for a two-thirds majority in the republic's 
Parliament. With several runoff elections scheduled, they are confident of 
reaching the required number. 
</P>
<P>
"There is now a 90% chance that Parliament will declare independence," said 
Janis Gavars, a member of Parliament. "When and how just depend on the 
situation in Lithuania and Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Supreme Council adopted a unilateral declaration of independence 
on March 11, and the republic has been locked in a war of nerves with the 
central government ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, warning of "grave consequences," told Lithuanians last weekend they 
must annul the act before the problem can be resolved. On Thursday, the 
Lithuanians responded with a conciliatory proposal for a dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Estonia's Parliament approved a step-by-step transition to independence -- but 
still drew a strong rebuke from Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Lithuanian and Estonian parties first split before the republics' 
governments moved to declare their independence. All three Baltic republics 
were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union during World War II under an 
agreement with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions remained high Friday in Lithuania. The official Soviet news agency 
Tass described the situation there as "an unsteady balance" with plans for a 
major pro-independence demonstration today. Workers, mostly Russians, held 
one-hour strikes Friday at factories in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, amid 
calls for Gorbachev to end the "chaos and disorder."

The leader of the Armenian Communist Party was replaced on Friday by a 
subordinate after two years of unremitting turmoil in the southern Soviet 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Suren G. Arutyunyan, who had been named the Armenian party's first secretary in 
May, 1988, after months of strife with neighboring Azerbaijan, is succeeded by 
Vladimir M. Movsisyan, who had been chairman of the republic's agro-industrial 
commission and a first deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass said that Arutyunyan, 51, a veterinarian who has 
worked as a party official for nearly 30 years, had sought a transfer to other 
unspecified duties. While Tass gave no explanation for the abrupt change, which 
was made by the Armenian party's Central Committee, Arutyunyan was regarded 
both in Moscow and in Armenia as less and less effective in dealing with the 
growing nationalism there.

SUPERPOWERS URGE ISRAEL TO BAR SOVIET EMIGRES FROM WEST BANK 
</P>

<P>
U.S. and Soviet officials pressed Israel on Friday to guarantee that Soviet 
Jewish immigrants will not be settled in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The statements marked the first time that the two superpowers have acted in 
apparent concert on the question, although each was already on the record as 
opposing settlement of Soviet Jews in Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President Bush at the White House, Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze told reporters that the Soviet Union is prepared to 
operate direct flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv if Israel will "give us 
assurances that people will not settle in occupied territories." 
</P>
<P>
Asked a few minutes later if the Administration also believes that Israel 
should give such assurances, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "Of 
course." He added: "We oppose settlements in the occupied territories." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has long insisted that the Soviets allow free emigration of 
Jews, and officials said Bush raised that issue with Shevardnadze again during 
their 2-hour, 20-minute meeting. But in recent months, the emigration issue has 
been complicated by the plans of the current Israeli government to allow 
immigrants to swell the population of West Bank settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets had made plans for direct flights to Israel, those plans 
were canceled in February after Arab groups protested that the steady increase 
in Soviet emigration was leading to a major expansion in the Jewish population 
of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Other nations have offered flights that would bring Soviet Jews to Israel, but 
terrorist groups have threatened to bomb airplanes carrying the emigres. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government would like to see direct Moscow-Tel Aviv flights. At the 
same time, American policy holds that to reach a final peace settlement, Israel 
eventually will have to give up at least some of the land captured from its 
Arab neighbors in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 
</P>
<P>
American officials who oppose the settlements and Israeli leaders who build 
them agree that the more the settlements grow, the more difficult it will be 
for Israel to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Secretary of State James A. Baker III set off a controversy by 
suggesting that the United States might withhold some aid to Israel unless the 
Israeli government could guarantee that the money would not be used for 
settlements in the occupied lands. Although Baker later appeared to back off 
that position, the issue remains a contentious one. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on Friday, Bush said "I 
have no intention of tying aid" to Israeli policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also denied that the Administration is pressing Israel to open talks with 
members of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"One of Israel's fears was that they would be compelled to talk to the PLO," 
Bush said. "We have made very clear to them, in detailed negotiations, that 
that was not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also denied that former President Jimmy Carter was carrying any message 
from the White House when he met earlier this week with PLO chief Yasser Arafat 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not acting with the blessing of or the disapproval of or anything else 
of the Administration," Bush said. "A former President should be free to do his 
own thing, and that's exactly what he's doing."

A state jury awarded $3.5 million Friday in a 13-year-old lawsuit accusing one 
of the nation's largest "vanity" publishers of fraud and deception. 
</P>
<P>
The class action suit represents 2,200 authors who have paid up to $8,000 each 
to have their book manuscripts published by New York-based Vantage Press since 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
Those titles include "Dogs I Have Known" and "The Sex Life of a Football 
Referee." 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit charged that Vantage Press made no effort to sell books or 
promote its authors. Vantage said it would appeal.

2 RCA EXECUTIVES GET JAIL TERMS IN PENTAGON CASE

Two RCA Corp. employees who pleaded guilty to obtaining and transporting 
classified Pentagon budget documents were sentenced Friday to two years in 
prison, with all but a few months suspended. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Ronald B. Stevens and Leonard C. Kampf, U.S. District Judge James 
C. Cacheris said he wanted the sentences to have a deterrent effect on those 
who might consider similar activity. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens and Kampf had pleaded guilty on Feb. 5, the same day that RCA Corp. 
pleaded guilty and paid $2.5 million to cover criminal and civil liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The cases stemmed from Operation Uncover, which investigated the trafficking in 
classified documents by major Defense Department contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The documents involved summarize the Pentagon's plan for future spending, said 
Michael J. Costello, head of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service's 
Washington field office. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, a manager of marketing services at RCA's Aerospace and Defense 
Division in Cherry Hill, N. J., was sentenced to two years in prison, with all 
but two months suspended, and 100 hours of community service. He was also 
placed on one year of supervised probation and fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf, who was employed as manager of marketing information and communications 
in RCA's Government Systems Division in Cherry Hill until his retirement in 
1984, was sentenced to two years in prison, with all but four months suspended, 
and 100 hours of community service. In addition, he was placed on one year of 
supervised probation and fined $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentencing of corporate employees to jail is a sanction which must occur 
if corporate America is to re-think its marketing philosophy," Costello said. 
"Corporations can't go to jail, and they have to consider the traumatic effect 
on their employees who may have to do hard time."

TEXAS WOMAN, 90, HOLDS BURGLAR AT GUNPOINT UNTIL POLICE ARRIVE

Ninety-year-old Gena Scarbrough said she learned how to shoot when growing up 
on a farm but had never pointed a weapon at anyone until this week, when she 
stopped a burglar with a borrowed pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Scarbrough stood in her carport Tuesday night waiting for an 
intruder to leave the house. 
</P>
<P>
When the burglar climbed out a window carrying a stereo and speakers, 
Scarbrough aimed the .22-caliber pistol at him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him: 'Put it down right there and don't move. Don't move or I'll 
shoot,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Scarbrough said she was not flustered and would have shot the burglar if he had 
not cooperated. She held the intruder at gunpoint until policemen arrived 
several minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd determined he wasn't going to get away," she said. "He'd broken into my 
property." 
</P>
<P>
A tenant at the duplex owned by Scarbrough had called her to say that someone 
was breaking into the other apartment. 
</P>
<P>
After calling the police, Scarbrough hurried to the property. In her haste, 
however, she forgot her shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
But Tommie Barnes, 72, who notified her of the break-in, handed her the handgun 
and was by her side when Scarbrough confronted the burglar. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers arrested Manfredo Barrios, 33, in connection with the break-in. 
</P>
<P>
A Dallas police spokesman criticized Scarbrough's action. "This is what we get 
paid to do," Cpl. Ray Bilbrey said. 
</P>
<P>
But Scarbrough, who sometimes listens to police scanners for entertainment, 
said she thinks homeowners should know how to defend their property with a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody ought to have one," she said. "You can't always get the 
police when you need them."

QUAKES SHAKE SEVERAL PARTS OF STATE BUT DO LITTLE DAMAGE 
</P>

A series of minor to moderate earthquakes shook widely separated areas of 
California from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Coachella Valley in a 
five-hour period Friday but caused no significant damage or injury, authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the temblors in the magnitude-3 range shook a large part of the Bay 
Area but were felt only as a small jolt before the start of the Bay Bridge 
baseball series in Candlestick Park. They were eerily reminiscent of the much 
larger 7.1 quake that struck Oct. 17 just before the start of a World Series 
game in the same park between the same teams, the San Francisco Giants and the 
Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The largest temblor Friday, a 4.5-magnitude shaker, struck about 7 p.m. 20 
miles southeast of San Francisco on the Concord Fault near Danville . 
</P>
<P>
An earlier Danville shaker, measuring 3.5 magnitude, hit at 1:55 p.m. In an 
area badly mauled by the killer October quake, it caused shattered nerves, 
knocked cans and bottles from market shelves and in some cases sent customers 
running in panic from stores. However, no significant damage was immediately 
reported and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A sportswriter at Candlestick said: "We mostly looked around at each other and 
said, 'Was that what I thought it was?' It was just a small jolt, but it was 
unsettling because of the Big One." 
</P>
<P>
In Walnut Creek, near Danville, customers at a Lucky supermarket ran out when 
cans and boxes tumbled from the shelves, store manager Gary Earl said. Tracy 
Hein, of the Contra Costa County Office of Community Services near Danville, 
said, "It was more like a truck hitting the building." 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area Rapid Transit trains that connect San Francisco with the East Bay 
suburbs were halted for five minutes as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:07 p.m., a 4.1-magnitude temblor, apparently unrelated to the Bay Area 
shaker, struck an isolated Coachella Valley desert area eight miles north of 
Indio, but did not even shake merchandise off store shelves there and got only 
passing attention in nearby Palm Springs, which is filled with college revelers 
on spring break.

A widespread search was under way by Los Angeles police Friday for a gunman who 
kidnaped a 10-year-old girl on her way to school in the West Adams district, 
then drove her to an alley where he raped her. 
</P>
<P>
Police would reveal few other details about the crime except that it occurred 
in the area of the Santa Monica Freeway and Western Avenue at 7:15 a.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>

MUSEUM MERGER CONSIDERED; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY GOVERNMENT: A PLAN UNDER CONSIDERATION WOULD EASE THE FINANCIAL WOES OF 
THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AND THE SYSTEM OF BOTANIC GARDENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
County officials are considering a merger of the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History and the county Arboreta and Botanic Gardens in a plan that 
would be a major restructuring of natural science facilities in Southern 
California, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The merger plan was described Friday by Craig Black, director of the natural 
history museum, and a spokeswoman for county Chief Administrative Officer 
Richard Dixon as preliminary and tentative. 
</P>
<P>
But if it is put into effect -- perhaps as early as the coming fiscal year that 
starts this summer -- the merger could ease the plight of two county 
organizations that have suffered from chronic financial difficulties in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The merged organization would create a complex of six museum and public garden 
facilities with a combined current budget of almost $20 million a year, nearly 
400 employees and hosting nearly 2 million visitors annually. The natural 
history museum has triple or quadruple the budget and numbers of employees and 
visitors as the arboreta. 
</P>
<P>
The merger would join into one organization the natural history museum in 
Exposition Park and its satellite George C. Page Museum at the LaBrea Tar Pits 
with the main county arboretum in Arcadia, Descanso Gardens in La 
Canada-Flintridge, the South Coast Botanic Gardens in Palos Verdes and the 
Virginia Robinson Estate in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The merged enterprise -- the name of which has not yet been decided on -- would 
also incorporate an internationally known collection of bird science materials 
held by the privately incorporated Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology. 
Earlier this year, officials of the foundation visited Descanso Gardens to 
review several specific potential construction sites for a new facility of 
between 20,000 and 40,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation was established by Ed N. Harrison, president of the natural 
history museum's county-appointed board of governors. The foundation 
collection, which is currently crowded into a small structure behind Harrison's 
Westside residence, has been searching for larger, permanent quarters for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
Another collection of ornithological research materials currently housed at 
UCLA might also be included in the merged entity, according to Lloyd Kiff, the 
foundation's curator. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Supervisor Mike Antonovich -- who represents the district in 
which the arboretum is headquartered -- said Antonovich "is aware of the 
conversations." The spokesman characterized the possible merger as one of 
several possibilities for linking the Arboreta and Botanic Gardens with another 
county agency. The spokesman and museum sources said the county Department of 
Parks and Recreation was another possible merger partner for the arboretum 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Any merger would have to be approved by the full five-member Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Black said he had been told by Dixon that the Board of Supervisors had 
discussed the proposal in general and asked for staff analysis. Both Black and 
John Campbell, a consultant to the county-run Citizens Economy and Efficiency 
Commission, which reviews consolidations and reforms of the county bureaucracy, 
characterized the joining of the museum complex and arboretum operation as a 
natural match with significant potential scientific, public and financial 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon was said to be out of town and not available for comment. Mary Jung, 
Dixon's assistant, confirmed that the topic had been discussed in the context 
of an informal proposal. Black said the plan had been discussed again last week 
in Dixon's office at a meeting of county department heads. 
</P>
<P>
But, Jung cautioned, the merger "is not a fait accompli. There is no staff work 
going on yet. There have been suggestions regarding consolidations, but there 
has not been active discussion about implementation plans." 
</P>
<P>
Black and other sources noted that merging the natural history museum and the 
arboretum complex had been discussed sporadically since the citizens economy 
commission issued its final report in 1983. The proposal resurfaced about three 
years ago, Black and other sources said, but was not pursued in deference to 
the arboretum's longtime director, Francis Ching. Ching retired April 1, 
however, and Black and sources familiar with the situation said his departure 
removed the last obstacle to putting the plan into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Black said the natural history museum's executive committee and full board had 
already held preliminary discussions of the merger. A discussion also is 
included in minutes of a Monday meeting of the museum's curators widely 
circulated within the museum and obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we bring to this process a long experience in dealing with the school 
systems, environmental education and education programming," Black said. "We 
have a staff in botany and an education division that would bring a lot of 
strength. We also have a history and knowledge of dealing with collections and 
an ability to generate proposals and funding at the federal level to support 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"It (a merger) certainly sounds right to me," said Campbell, who emphasized he 
was speaking for himself as a consultant and not for the citizens' commission. 
"The arboretum has always considered itself to be more museum-like than 
park-like. It has research functions and strength in botanical research. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems an incredibly sensible idea that ought to be put into effect." 
</P>
<P>
The curators' meeting minutes also indicate the museum has already held 
preliminary discussions about relocating its botany department to the arboretum 
-- a step in resolving what has become a crucial overcrowding problem at the 
museum's Exposition Park headquarters. The museum has added leased space in two 
nearby warehouses in the last two months to try to accommodate its burgeoning 
collections. A plan to build a satellite facility in the Sepulveda Basin area 
of the San Fernando Valley a couple of years ago led nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has also experienced recent asbestos-abatement problems that have 
apparently focused new concern among museum employees on the adequacy of the 
Exposition Park facilities. An accidental release of asbestos fibers during 
removal by workers in the museum's basement a month ago resulted in a large 
area of the basement being roped off. Friday, warning signs were reportedly 
posted after a visit to the site by federal inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
The asbestos removal problem was seen by museum insiders as symptomatic of a 
variety of problems -- but chiefly as a manifestation of an ongoing financial 
squeeze that has gripped virtually every county-owned cultural institution. The 
merger plan was widely viewed as primarily an attempt to address issues of 
cost-control and to ease financial strain on both the museum and arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the arboretum had been particularly hard hit by money reductions 
since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978. He said staffing levels in the 
complex had been reduced by as much as 80%. "To coalesce and consolidate all of 
the effort would improve the picture a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Arnold, acting director of the arboretum, maintained he had not been 
officially told of the merger plan. But he said rumors of the possible joining 
of facilities -- which would be the largest and most significant merger of 
county museums ever affected -- had become so widespread this week that four of 
the 15 members of the arboretum's board of directors had called him to inquire 
if the reports were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold voiced fears, however, that a merger would impair the arboretum's 
ability to raise private sector funds. He said the complex currently has five 
separate private support organizations that raise a combined total of about 
$900,000 a year for the arboretum. But they are dwarfed by the much larger Los 
Angeles County Museum of Natural History Foundation, which accounts for between 
a third and a half of the museum's total budget of $16 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I question whether, under some kind of merger with whoever it might be, that 
the enthusiasm (of the five support groups) might dry up and go away," Arnold 
said. "I personally think this could be detrimental to the arboretum." 
</P>
<P>
The merger plan surfaces nearly three years after an earlier attempt by the 
natural history museum to take over the private Southwest Museum in Mount 
Washington fell apart after details of secret negotiations were reported in 
news media. The disclosures prompted an intense political controversy in which 
City Councilman Richard Alatorre vehemently opposed any loss of autonomy for 
the Southwest Museum, which houses one of the most significant collections of 
Native American art and artifacts in North America. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also comes as the natural history museum is struggling to resolve 
a conflict with the National Science Foundation over allegedly inadequate and 
improper accounting practices that led the federal science agency to declare 
the museum ineligible for new federal grants late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The ineligibility still has not been lifted, but Black said a federal audit 
team is due to return to the museum for a three-day visit at the end of this 
month. The science foundation has set a May 15 deadline for the museum to 
institute acceptable changes in its accounting system. The foundation has 
demanded return of more than $250,000 in federal grant money it says may have 
been improperly spent.

<P>
TELEVISION: AN L.A. RUG BUSINESS'S UNDERWRITING OF 'ART UNDERFOOT' IS A CASE 
STUDY IN HOW FAR THE RULES HAVE BEEN BENT SINCE PUBLIC STATIONS HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWED TO ACCEPT MONEY FROM COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
In these days of TV commercials masquerading as full-length programs, it 
probably will surprise few viewers to see that "Art Underfoot," a series 
debuting today about fine art carpets, is being backed by a local rug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
It is even less of a surprise that the dealer, Moses Haroonian, is offering 
special discounts to customers who mention the program when they come into his 
store, the Oriental Rug Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But "Art Underfoot" is no cheaply made info-mercial, running on an obscure 
cable or UHF channel. It is a high-gloss series meant to showcase the cultures 
of the people who make rugs. It was produced for the Public Broadcasting 
Service and is running -- along with two 15-second announcements about 
Haroonian's support -- for 10 weeks on noncommercial KCET Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in PBS funding regulations during the Reagan Administration, encouraged 
by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission and reinforced by the FCC 
as recently as last week, allow public television stations to accept 
underwriting from businesses whose commercial endeavors are related to the 
subject of the program, as long as they are not involved in shaping the content 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's sale of underwriting rights for "Art Underfoot" is a case study in how 
far the rules have bent since the days when commercial ties to public 
television programs were prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Haroonian found out about "Art Underfoot" through the community of rug 
importers and retailers of which he is a part. Like dealers across the nation, 
he decided to offer to underwrite the program locally, assuming that he would 
be able to capitalize on his $5,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
"To us, this program is one of the most important steps being taken to make 
people understand about rugs," Haroonian said in an interview. "To really 
understand how they are produced and where they come from, and really know the 
product from a different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Careful to comply with the rules as KCET explained them, Haroonian taped a 
15-second announcement about his store to run at the beginning and end of each 
of the series' 10 programs. 
</P>
<P>
He then proceeded to conduct his own, separate advertising campaign. He 
prepared an expensive, color mailer that invited recipients to watch the 
program -- and offered them "a 10% discount on our already reduced sale prices" 
if they followed up with a visit to the store. He planned to take out ads in 
newspapers and on radio making the same offer. 
</P>
<P>
The invitation identified Oriental Rug Center as a "sponsor" of the program, 
not an "underwriter," and used the KCET logo. The store encouraged viewers to 
tune in because "the more you know about rugs, the easier our task will be." 
</P>
<P>
"If they mention the program (when customers come into the store), they 
automatically get a 10% discount," Haroonian said in the interview. "And we're 
going to have a question-and-answer event where people can come in during the 
10 weeks (and ask about rugs). We are going to mention that in our advertising. 
We also have a pretty large mailing list." 
</P>
<P>
KCET spokeswoman Barbara Goen said that Haroonian had used the station's logo 
without permission and had incorrectly identified himself as a sponsor, but 
insisted that neither his behavior nor the station's acceptance of his 
underwriting dollars broke the rules on funding of public television. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Oriental Rug Center) were not involved with the program, they had 
nothing to do with its production. So the fact that they make the product that 
is being looked on in the series isn't an issue," Goen said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, PBS' underwriting guidelines prohibit financial contributions from 
people and firms with a direct involvement in the editorial content of the 
program, said spokeswoman Mary Jane McKinven. They are also meant to ensure 
that the public does not come away with the perception that an underwriter has 
an interest in a program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to consumer-oriented or "how-to" programs, the rules are not 
as strict, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception test is applied much more stringently to news and 
public-affairs programming than in this realm of how-to's," McKinven said. And 
at the local level, she added, underwriters come on board long after the 
program has been produced, so even the perception of conflict of interest is 
not a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of match-up is not unusual in local underwriting," McKinven said. 
"The program is done, it's down the pike. They're not going to go back in and 
break into the editorial content." 
</P>
<P>
But critics say it's only natural that PBS' relaxed underwriting rules have led 
to aggressive marketing behavior like that of Haroonian, and worry that such 
behavior may lessen the credibility of public broadcasting -- or worse, make it 
appear that KCET is endorsing a particular business. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is the perception and the possible reality of a relationship 
between public broadcasting and commercial enterprises," said Geoff Cowan, a 
former board member of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting who now teaches 
mass communication courses at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's perfectly appropriate to encourage corporate sponsorship and 
underwriting," Cowan continued. "But where the line ought to be drawn would be 
where there appears to be a direct link between the program being aired and the 
product being sold." 
</P>
<P>
KCET's experience with Haroonian is not the only sticky underwriting situation 
in which public television recently has found itself. Bob Vila, the host of 
PBS' popular housing renovation program, "This Old House," was asked to leave 
the Boston-produced series last year after he made commercials for products 
used in construction and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
And Sharon Baker, who produced "Art Underfoot," said that she personally called 
a rug dealer in another city (which she declined to identify) and asked him to 
stop running advertisements linking his store to the program. The dealer, who 
was not the program's underwriter, complied, she said. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's experience with Haroonian "makes me very uncomfortable," Baker said. "It 
cheapens our whole effort." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Grossman, a former president of PBS who now teaches at Columbia 
University's Gannett Center for Media Studies, said that the network now relies 
so heavily on underwriting that corporate interests are beginning to influence 
the types of programs shown on public stations. 
</P>
<P>
"(Boston PBS station) WGBH had a real problem with 'This Old House,' when it 
turned out there was a lot of back scratching, and program content was being 
affected by who the underwriters were," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also have the same problem with financial houses underwriting 'Wall Street 
Week' and other financial programs," Grossman said. "We have all these 
(business) programs (on public television) because there are backers for them, 
but I don't see very many programs about labor issues." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Bass, director of corporate support for PBS, disagreed. Public 
television has "a very balanced source of support which ensures that no one 
entity is driving anything," he said. "The fact of the matter is, in terms of 
our national programming expenditures, corporate underwriting accounts for less 
than 30%, which means that more than 60% is coming from viewer support and 
local stations and the federal government and other support." 
</P>
<P>
It's not realistic to think that public television can get by without corporate 
sponsorship, Bass said, because federal support was dramatically cut back 
during the 1980s, and the network simply can't survive on membership drives 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
And when businesses contribute funds to an organization or project, they expect 
to get something out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter here is you always have a delicate balance," Bass said. 
"On the one hand, the expectation is that companies are supporting programs for 
totally selfless reasons, and at the same time we know that nobody does 
anything for totally selfless reasons." 
</P>
<P>
KCET's Goen said that the underwriting on "Art Underfoot" has raised serious 
concerns at the station, and might lead to changes in the way relationships 
with underwriters are handled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if anything comes out of this for KCET, it's that we would ask our 
local underwriters to stay in closer touch with us on what they are planning to 
do," Goen said. 
</P>
<P>
But neither KCET nor PBS is likely to change its policy of encouraging 
companies to underwrite programs in their areas of interest, or to ask them not 
to publicize their participation, said PBS spokeswoman McKinven. 
</P>
<P>
"The underwriter has to see some benefit in associating themselves with a 
program," she said.

RICK DU BROW: CAN GOOD TV LURE VIEWERS TO NETWORKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW

<TEXT>
<P>
Something important is happening in TV. And we're right in the middle of it. 
</P>
<P>
The networks, hemorrhaging and groggy from audience defection, are suddenly 
unleashing a whirlwind of new tryout series -- from Carol Burnett's "Carol 
&amp; Company" to "Bagdad Cafe" to Sunday's much-awaited "Twin Peaks" -- to 
prove they can be interesting again. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything's working, but last week, this week and the next few weeks 
comprise one of the most critical periods of audience testing in recent network 
television history. 
</P>
<P>
Positive viewer response to a taste for experimentation would surely influence 
the new fall schedules due next month from ABC, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The networks' motivation is simple: fear. What else could it be after their 
tried-and-true formula shows were blown away by two nonconformist series that 
turned out to be the season's biggest new hits -- ABC's "America's Funniest 
Home Videos" and Fox Broadcasting's satirical cartoon entry "The Simpsons"? 
</P>
<P>
This week's ratings showed audiences hungrily searching for something else new. 
Surely the shocker in the ratings was the unexpectedly powerful debut on 
last-place CBS of the Whoopi Goldberg-Jean Stapleton sitcom, "Bagdad Cafe," 
which ranked 18th among all shows, with 27% of the audience tuning in the tale 
of the two women who work together in a desert diner. 
</P>
<P>
Will it hold up? Who knows? But viewers are checking out the spring menu. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol &amp; Company," an NBC comedy anthology, also had a potent ratings debut 
last Saturday, ranking No. 9 and attracting 32% of the audience. It certainly 
benefited greatly from its powerful lead-in, "The Golden Girls." But viewer 
curiosity was also there to check out the return of a great TV star, Burnett, 
in her first series in a decade; and the show held almost all the audience that 
"The Golden Girls" provided it. 
</P>
<P>
Networks basically hate the anthology form -- they think it's too risky and can 
point to such recent ratings failures as Steven Spielberg's "Amazing Stories." 
Clearly, Burnett's popularity made the series possible. It gets its second 
outing tonight, and then its fate will be decided finally when it is switched 
to 10 p.m., after "Empty Nest," starting next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever its fate, Burnett may well have her finger on TV's new mood -- 
and viewer boredom -- when she sizes up how the networks have looked to her 
since her last series: 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was perfect situation comedy. So perfect that I could tell they 
were probably done mostly in pickup -- that is, they might do it in front of an 
audience, but you could tell that they'd stopped, gone back to re-do a scene 
because maybe somebody flubbed a line. For me, it was too perfect. There wasn't 
a sense of any kind of danger or being on the edge of that liveness that I 
think is the most fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have to be picture perfect as long as the spontaneity is there. And 
then I found out that a lot of (the shows) go way into the night, like 1 
o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning, and they're doing pickup shots. People are 
dragging and they've lost their audience, and then comes the canned laughter 
and all that." 
</P>
<P>
But the staggering ratings of "America's Funniest Home Videos," with its 
primitive tapes, unquestionably validate Burnett's point about the appeal of 
spontaneity as opposed to overly manufactured TV sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
While Burnett is finally getting a chance at her anthology -- "Everybody called 
it the A-word," she says -- ABC is also gambling big Sunday night with "Twin 
Peaks," a Gothic soap opera laced with horror and humor, which depicts 
small-town life the way Norman Rockwell might have painted it if he had gone 
berserk or tripped out on LSD. 
</P>
<P>
Although many who have seen the two-hour debut of "Twin Peaks" regard it as a 
TV masterpiece, ABC is extremely nervous about whether the public will accept 
it -- and also about the extraordinary advance praise it has received. One ABC 
official points to the considerable praise lavished on "Elvis," the splendid 
series about the early days of Elvis Presley, which failed miserably in the 
ratings just recently. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, ABC, with its attractive programming ranging from "Roseanne" to 
"thirtysomething," also drew respectable ratings with two episodes of another 
new series last week, "Equal Justice," about a group of young prosecutors. 
While it was not a representative ratings week because of the Academy Awards 
and the NCAA basketball playoffs, viewers were undeniably shopping around. 
</P>
<P>
They shopped around so much looking for something different that even a 
standard, by-the-numbers, new NBC sitcom called "A Family for Joe," with Robert 
Mitchum, did reasonably well in the ratings. And so did another standard new 
CBS sitcom, "Sugar and Spice," helped by the lead-in of "Bagdad Cafe." 
</P>
<P>
This week, meanwhile, the ratings also were passable for the debut of a bright 
new ABC comedy, "The Marshall Chronicles," with Joshua Rifkind simply 
delightful as a New York teen-ager with a Woody Allen flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The moves by ABC, CBS and NBC to revive viewer interest -- and beat the 
competition -- make the current burst of new shows much more than merely 
another group of mid-season entries. The stakes get increasingly high as the 
alternatives to network television grow. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the fierce maneuvering as next season approaches, NBC 
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff has signed series and/or movie deals 
with such creators as Ron Howard ("Cocoon"), Gary David Goldberg ("Family 
Ties"), Paul Witt and Tony Thomas ("The Golden Girls"), Joel Silver ("Lethal 
Weapon"), Dan Curtis ("War and Remembrance"), Bill Persky ("Kate &amp; Allie"), 
Bruce Paltrow ("St. Elsewhere"), Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz 
("thirty-something"), John Sacret Young ("China Beach") and Garry Marshall 
("Beaches"). 
</P>
<P>
The dimensions of such competition were outlined nicely Wednesday in a speech 
by Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, to the Royal 
Television Society in London: 
</P>
<P>
"In such a dicey business as TV, the biggest players are willing to pay big 
premiums for proven talent because it reduces the even costlier risks of 
failure. Thus the Disney studio, whose brilliance in movies and theme parks is 
now beginning to trickle into television, is pouring tens of millions into a 
search for TV Cinderellas. It is paying writers with the mere hint of a 
reputation huge fees, unconcerned that many of them will turn out to be ugly 
sisters." 
</P>
<P>
According to Stringer, "Just last week, the writer-creator of one of our best 
shows watched in amazement as a rival studio paid her number-three writing team 
double the fee she was getting. Then before she could say the word 
'typewriter,' she herself received a huge offer from yet another studio to 
abandon her current show and start another one." 
</P>
<P>
According to a CBS source, the writer-creator was Diane English, whose show, 
"Murphy Brown," is a Warner Bros. production, and the writing team in question 
was lured to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
But with such high stakes, Stringer noted, it is easy to give "script writers 
and directors less room to experiment." That, of course, is what has turned off 
viewers and perhaps, finally, has caused the networks to start rolling the dice 
again -- for their own survival. As Stringer observed in his London speech: 
</P>
<P>
"There is a wonderful show in the U.S. It is a contemporary family situation 
comedy in cartoon form. It is called 'The Simpsons.' Its writers are virtually 
all in their 20s. That's the excitement of television."

ABOVE THE LAW IS HAPPY TO TAKE THE RAP FOR 'MURDER';

<P>
POP: THEIR RUDE, CRUDE DEBUT SINGLE IS NO. 2 ON THE CHART AFTER ONLY A MONTH. 
THE SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A. GROUP HEADLINES TONIGHT IN ANAHEIM.

"Murder Rap" is a cold slap in the face amid the bouncy hip-hop on KDAY-AM: a 
shriek of synthesized siren, a single piano bass note, a nervous drum beat that 
twitches like a sweaty trigger finger on a stolen AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
Over this, a rapper who calls himself Cold-187um, after the police code for 
homicide, says "Now I've got a murder rap" over and over in a flat, dusky tenor 
remarkably similar to that of former N.W.A member Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is none of the merry banter that underlies an N.W.A song, none 
of Public Enemy's grace, none of Ice-T's gift for metaphor. "Murder Rap" is 
possibly the crudest song ever to reach heavy radio rotation. 
</P>
<P>
After only a month, this debut single from South-Central L.A. rap posse Above 
the Law is No. 2 on the Billboard magazine rap chart. And the group's "Livin' 
Like Hustlers" had an initial shipment of 150,000, impressive for a first 
album. They've sold 140,000 of these in the first week, and the group headlines 
Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The four members of Above the Law, the newest hard-core rappers in the platinum 
stable of Compton-based producer Dr. Dre, glowered in the plush Hollywood suite 
of their publicist. 
</P>
<P>
In the crowded category of hard rap, ATL is the hardest. Take the gangster 
mystique cultivated by N.W.A's Ice Cube, who recently went out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Ice Cube, how's he going to write about something he's never been through?" 
asked Go-Mack, one of the group's two deejays. (ATL's KM.G, a rapper, and 
deejay K-Oss remained mute through the interview.) 
</P>
<P>
"Ice Cube had a good house, he had both a mother and father with him, he got 
bused to a good school. . . . The only rowdy people he knew was us. He was 
writing about us. What you hear on N.W.A's album, we was in it while he was 
only writin' about it." 
</P>
<P>
When informed of Go-Mack's comments, Ice Cube quipped: "New jacks (poseurs) 
from Pomona should only talk about the 10 Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
"We wasn't gangsters," 187um said, "we was hustlers. Gangsters are ruthless 
killers; hustlers use whatever means necessary, get busy if we have to. 
Whatever you can think of that went down in South-Central, we was part of it. 
The whole nine yards." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, ATL has little sympathy for the currently popular "positive rap" 
movement led by Boogie Down Productions' KRS-One. "We don't want to be 
hypocrites," 187um said. "We want to talk about what we've been through and who 
we are. We had to get away from the basic rap style, talking about peace, love 
and dancing. Our generation shot out with the drugs, the gang bangin', the 
whole nine. It would be fake for us to go out and tell people to stop the 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get us wrong, all of us -- N.W.A too -- are aware of who we are and 
where we come from. We're just talking about what's going down, not peace, 
peace, peace all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Go-Mack and 187um grew up in Pomona and hung out in the South-Central rap 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
They formed the current version of Above the Law at the suggestion of Go-Mack's 
cousin LayLaw, a member of the N.W.A entourage. Many people still think of ATL 
as the little brothers of N.W.A. 
</P>
<P>
"But we want to be known because we're Above the Law," 187um said, "not because 
we're down with N.W.A." 
</P>
<P>
"We was above the law, livin' like hustlers," Go-Mack said. "We used to be 
street hustlers. Now we media hustlers instead."

TV EVANGELISTS STEPPING UP APPEALS FOR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years after the Jim Bakker-PTL scandal broke, some major television 
evangelists are devoting even more time to fund-raising and promotion and have 
turned to Eastern Europe as a focus of such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings reported by Stephen Winzenburg, a scholar who has 
monitored religious broadcasting for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Winzenburg, a journalism professor at Grand View College in Iowa, studied the 
contents of 65 religious broadcasts from November, 1989, to February, 1990, and 
compared the content during that period to March, 1987, when the PTL scandal 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
He found that Oral Roberts now uses 53% of his air time in fund-raising and 
promotion, up from 22% in 1987, and Pat Robertson spends 44% of his program 
time to do the same, up from 20%. 
</P>
<P>
However, the trend was different for two other major television ministers. 
Jerry Falwell's fund-raising and promotion declined from 52% to 37% and PTL, 
now known as Heritage Ministries, cut back its fund-raising and promotion from 
40% of its program time to 12%. 
</P>
<P>
"The programs that appeared to be in the most trouble three years ago have 
stabilized and have attracted a small but loyal number of contributors," 
Winzenburg said. "But Roberts and Robertson must be in serious trouble to feel 
the need to spend almost half of their shows asking for money." 
</P>
<P>
The researcher also found that ministers such as Billy Graham, Robert Schuller 
and Jimmy Swaggart -- in addition to Robertson and Falwell -- "have each asked 
for more financial support so they can begin to evangelize in the European 
countries where democratic reforms are taking place." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that many major ministries have quietly returned to their 
pre-PTL-scandal levels of income. Most used the scandal "to raise funds by 
claiming they were struggling to survive," he said. "Viewers responded with 
more money, and some TV ministers are now receiving more contributions than 
ever before." 
</P>
<P>
Reporting that seven of the top 10 religious broadcasts have seen their ratings 
increase in the last six months, Winzenburg commented that "the PTL scandal 
appears to have caused only a temporary setback to televised religion. Most 
televangelists have learned how to thrive off a smaller number of viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Winzenburg divides the content of religious broadcasts into three main 
categories -- fund-raising and promotion, politics and spiritual. The first 
includes promotion of books and buildings, such as college construction, as 
well as solicitation of money. The second involves political issues such as 
abortion and homosexuality, as well as comments on specific policies of the 
White House and Congress. The third includes sermons, personal testimonies of 
what God has done in people's lives and songs with religious themes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these lines blur, and I will admit that," Winzenburg told Religious 
New Service in a telephone interview. "Sometimes if Pat Robertson is making a 
political comment, he might also be making a spiritual point and fund-raising," 
as in an appeal to send money to help finance a campaign against a political 
measure that Robertson considers to go against biblical principles. 
</P>
<P>
In such a case, Winzenburg said, he has to "decide what is the main point of 
the comment," even if all three elements are present. 
</P>
<P>
The researcher found that "The World Tomorrow," the public issues-oriented 
program of the Worldwide Church of God produced in Pasadena, had the highest 
political content at 43%, followed by Pat Robertson with 29%. He also found 
that a number of popular broadcasts have no measurable political content, 
including those of Robert Schuller, Oral Roberts and Heritage Ministries.

RELIGIOUS FIGURES MAKE LIST OF 'MOST ADMIRED' IN DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The list of men "most admired" by Americans over the last decade is dominated 
by religious figures, according to the Princeton Religion Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
The organization affiliated with the Gallup Poll cites surveys showing that -- 
apart from the most popular figure, former President Ronald Reagan -- the most 
admired men during the 1980s were religious figures. 
</P>
<P>
After Reagan as the men most admired during the course of the 1980s were, in 
descending order, Pope John Paul II, the Rev. Billy Graham, the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson and former President Jimmy Carter, who is an active "born again" 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
The latest poll, conducted in 1989, placed President George Bush first, Soviet 
Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, Reagan, the Pope, Graham, Lech Walesa, Donald Trump 
and Lee Iacocca, Jackson, and, in a tie for 10th, Carter and Bill Cosby.

ISRAEL-PALESTINE ISSUE TENSIONS RAISED BY HOLY WEEK PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something as seemingly innocent as a prayer apparently can be explosive when 
involving the taut feelings of Palestinians and Israel's Jews. That combustible 
mix has set off a Holy Week furor. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar was ignited by a prayer prepared by the Middle East Council of 
Churches and distributed to U.S. church leaders, along with the council's 
request that it be read during Palm Sunday services this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The prayer "seems to be extremely provocative, recalling the worst uses of 
Christian Holy Week as a club against Jews," said the Rev. Elliott Wright of 
the U.S. National Conference of Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Protests also came from Jewish organizations. The Dutch Council of Churches and 
Protestant churches in West Germany reportedly have declined to approve use of 
the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the 400-word prayer focused mainly on three paragraphs, one of 
them dealing by implication with a Palestinian state, but not specifying it, 
saying in part: 
</P>
<P>
"We come to Jerusalem . . . and we see . . . that people remain in agony and 
suffering. Strengthen those who . . . have been deprived of the right to live 
in dignity. . . . Free them from oppression; restore to them the right to life 
and to independence in their own land." 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East Council of Churches, embracing heavily Palestinian 
denominations, proposed this Sunday's prayer as the start of a 50-day linking 
of world churches in prayers for Holy Land peace, culminating on Pentecost, 
June 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Gabriel Habib, the council's general secretary, said in a letter 
presenting the plan: 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the solidarity in prayer . . . will emphasize both the tragedy of 
the situation -- the denial of the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people 
-- and the faith that . . . the grievous wrongs can be righted." 
</P>
<P>
As for wording of the opening prayer itself, it may seem innocuous to many 
Christians, but critics point out its stickier connotations. 
</P>
<P>
It "is a thinly veiled attack on the state of Israel in liturgical form," said 
the American Jewish Committee, adding that using the prayer "would inject a 
divisive and polarizing element" into Christian services. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, senior vice president of the National Conference of Christians and 
Jews, which for a half century has worked for interfaith partnership, said the 
prayer could "cause Jewish-Christian tensions in U.S. communities." 
</P>
<P>
It is "a carefully constructed, ideologically subtle document," he added. 
"Sentences and paragraphs do not always end up where you think they are 
headed." 
</P>
<P>
He said some consider the prayer "a pro-Palestinian political statement 
combined with a narrow, exclusive theological point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi A. James Rudin, the American Jewish Committee's interreligious affairs 
director, and the associate director, Judith H. Banki, said the prayer "is 
filled with mischievous innuendoes." 
</P>
<P>
Rudin and Banki said the wording "makes the reckless and unjustified claim that 
Palestinian Arabs are being deprived of their 'very right to life' by Israel." 
</P>
<P>
"Such language implies that the physical destruction of the Palestinian 
community is the goal of policy of Israel. This is a malicious slander," they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others have criticized portions that refer by implication to Israelis without 
naming them, saying in part: 
</P>
<P>
"We come to Jerusalem . . . and we see that there are those who live in fear. . 
. . Free them from the illusion that depriving others of their rights, or even 
eliminating them, will provide security or reaffirm self-identity." 
</P>
<P>
The other criticized paragraph refers to Jerusalem itself and projects its 
unity in "one body," equated with Christianity, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"When we meet in you (Jerusalem) as one body . . . carrying the Good News, and 
when we bring to realization your justice on Earth, then will Jerusalem become 
the community of all believers." 
</P>
<P>
Rudin and Banki pointed out that many noted Christian theologians have publicly 
repudiated such "religious triumphalism," and added that Jerusalem today is, in 
fact, a community of Jewish, Christian and Muslim believers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed prayer was distributed in this country to heads of denominations 
and to local ecumenical councils by the U.S. National Council of Churches, 
including most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox bodies. 
</P>
<P>
(In Los Angeles, however, Chuck Jones, director of the Southern California 
Ecumenical Council, said this week that he did not recall receiving the 
material. Charles Kimball, director of the Middle East office of the National 
Council, said by telephone that he knew the large Riverside Church in New York 
was going to use the prayer, but he had no idea of whether many denominations 
have sent the materials to local churches. "The controversy over it really 
stems from the recent interpretations given to it, not from the document 
itself," Kimball said.) 
</P>
<P>
A covering memorandum with the prayer said that the material "clearly reflects 
the perspective of the Middle East Council of Churches," and was being sent at 
its request. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said it was uncertain whether U.S. denominations would pass the text on 
to congregations. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect that everyone would agree that prayer is in order for peace between 
Israelis and Palestinians," Wright said. "Efforts to counteract anti-Semitism 
in no way diminish concern for the Palestinians and for a genuine and lasting 
peace in the area."

U.S. BISHOPS URGE MORE SPENDING ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have asked Congress to give "special scrutiny" to 
costly weapons systems and readjust the nation's "misplaced priorities" by 
significantly increasing domestic social spending. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to members of the House and Senate Budget committees, Archbishop 
Roger Mahony of Los Angeles and Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, said 
the federal budget is "not just a fiscal blueprint but also a moral document" 
and they criticized President Bush's proposal to lower the capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the budget) is a reflection of our real values as a people and a document 
with clear moral dimensions," said the two prelates, speaking on behalf of the 
U.S. Catholic Conference in a March 27 letter made public recently. 
</P>
<P>
"With the income gap between the rich and the poor larger now than at any time 
since such records have been kept," the bishops said, "we question proposals 
which have the effect of lowering taxes for the wealthiest Americans." 
</P>
<P>
They urged Congress to evaluate the Bush proposal "in light of the already 
regressive nature of the overall tax structure and the need to raise revenues 
fairly to fund human-needs programs and reduce the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony is chairman of the conference's International Policy Committee and 
Malone heads the Domestic Policy Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was written as Congress considers Bush's budget proposal for fiscal 
1991, which starts on Oct. 1.

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SPRINGTIME HIKING TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a unit of the National 
Park Service, offers the following tips for springtime hiking in the Santa 
Monica Mountains: 
</P>
<P>
* Water is life. Carry plenty of water and drink it. 
</P>
<P>
One quart or more for short walks. More for longer hikes. Alcohol is not a good 
substitute for water. 
</P>
<P>
* Sun protection. Wear sunscreen, hat and sunglasses. Long-sleeved shirts are 
recommended on sunny days. 
</P>
<P>
* Never hike alone; use the buddy system. That leaves someone to go for help if 
you run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
* Plan your hike and tell someone -- a close friend or family member -- about 
the plan. Stick with your trip plan. 
</P>
<P>
* Wear sturdy footwear: hiking boots or sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not build fires. Do not smoke. 
</P>
<P>
* Carry a well-equipped first aid kit. 
</P>
<P>
* High outdoor temperatures can reduce a hiker's efficiency. Travel light. The 
heaviest item in your backpack should be water. 
</P>
<P>
* Be aware that the Southern Pacific rattlesnake lives in the mountains. Stay 
away from it and it won't bother you. 
</P>
<P>
* State parks are closed during periods of extreme fire danger. Call (213) 
454-2372 for a 24-hour recorded fire-condition message.

A code expert from West Germany's mission to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in Brussels has been seized on suspicion of spying for East 
Germany. The case may have done enormous damage to the Western Alliance, 
officials said. The officer, whose name was not given, is being held in West 
Germany on suspicion of having passed alliance secrets to East Germany for more 
than 20 years.

TOURIST KILLING MAY BE TIED TO 2 OTHERS

Police say the killing earlier this week of a teen-age tourist from Michigan 
may be related to two similar slayings of young women in the same area since 
January. Police had been reluctant to comment on the growing fears about a 
serial killer stalking young women in the sprawling rows of apartment buildings 
in the neighborhood near Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But police released a statement after the stabbing death Tuesday of Holly 
Suzanne Tarr, 18, a high school tourist from Okemos, Mich. Because of two 
similar cases in recent months, "We can't discount the possibility that the 
three may have been committed by the same person," police spokeswoman Dorothy 
Powell said. "All of the victims were young women. All were students. All were 
murdered in upstairs apartments. And all were stabbed during the day."

A measure that would have required backers of ballot initiatives to list 
publicly any contributions of $10,000 or more toward their campaign was vetoed 
by Gov. George Deukmejian. The proposal, offered by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San 
Francisco), was aimed at discouraging contributions made in exchange for a 
specific benefit from an initiative. The governor said he supported the bill's 
purpose, but insisted that Kopp's measure would not accomplish its stated goal.

KINGS LOSE, BUT GET GOOD NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO HOCKEY: CALGARY WINS, 8-5, AFTER GRETZKY RETURNS TO ICE AND PRACTICES FOR 
20 MINUTES. HE MIGHT PLAY IN GAME 3 SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heat was on the Flames. Disenchantment rumbled through Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Directed at goalie Mike Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
At Coach Terry Crisp. 
</P>
<P>
And at anybody skating in a red uniform. 
</P>
<P>
That the Flames might lose their Stanley Cup in the first round to the Kings 
was hard enough to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Lose to the Kings without Gretzky? That was too much. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, down 1-0 in the best-of-seven series, the Flames turned that heat 
on the Kings, blasting away early and often en route to an 8-5 triumph before a 
sellout crowd of 20,166 at the Olympic Saddledome to tie the series at a game 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw the real Calgary tonight," King Coach Tom Webster said. "We kind of 
accepted that they would show up to play. We have to rise to that level." 
</P>
<P>
The return of Wayne Gretzky might provide the shot of adrenaline that could 
move the Kings to a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
He skated for 20 minutes Friday, the first time he has been on the ice since 
injuring his back March 22. Gretzky is expected to practice today with his 
teammates for the first time and might see limited action Sunday in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
King goalie Kelly Hrudey saw plenty of action Friday, more than he could 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
He had predicted before the game that the Flames would come early and hard, 
bent on revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Like a soldier in the trenches, he waited. 
</P>
<P>
Not long. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gilmour scored 1:41 into the game, sweeping in the puck from the right 
side after Hrudey had blocked a shot by Brian MacLellan. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left after a little more than 32 minutes, Hrudey had faced 26 shots 
and given up five goals. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like everything was going against Hrudey and his replacement, Mario 
Gosselin. Hrudey was facing the top scoring team in the NHL two nights after 
going all the way in a tough 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
He was playing on legs getting to full strength after a four-month battle with 
mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
Even his own teammates and the clock seemed against him and Gosselin at times. 
</P>
<P>
After Joe Mullen scored a short-handed goal to give Calgary a 2-0 lead, Marty 
McSorley cut the margin in half with a 20-foot shot from the slot off a pass 
from Luc Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
But then, in the second period, with Gary Roberts in position and unchecked 
near the left crease and the puck on his stick, McSorley tried to skate into 
the path of Roberts' shot. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he skated right into Hrudey, knocking the goalie to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
That left Roberts the opening he needed to push his club ahead, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by Joel Otto and Jim Korn moved Calgary into what appeared to be a 
commanding 5-1 lead and moved Hrudey to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to check the momentum," Webster said, "and slow it down. You could see 
he (Hrudey) was tiring." 
</P>
<P>
No argument from Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great at the beginning," he said. "But they came out storming and 
bombarded me early. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second period, they kept up the pressure with another wave of momentum. 
I thought putting in Mario slowed them down a little." 
</P>
<P>
That's when the clock turned against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The stat sheet shows the Flames zero for six on the power play. But they 
actually had an advantage on their next two goals after Robitaille and Larry 
Robinson each scored to make the score 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour deflected a Brad McCrimmon shot to give the Flames a 6-3 lead one 
second after a power play had expired, leaving the Kings no time to return to 
full strength. 
</P>
<P>
After Robitaille scored his second goal of the game, the Flames answered with a 
goal by Joe Nieuwendyk two seconds after another power play had ended. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to be excited," Roberts said. "They got their split. We played 
very well at some points, but, then again, we fell asleep like we did the other 
night." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Game 3 will be played Sunday at the Forum, Game 4 Tuesday. Faceoff both nights 
is at 7:30. . . . Should there be a Game 6, it would be played at the Forum 
April 14. . . . Wayne Gretzky is not the only one feeling better, Defenseman 
Tom Laidlaw, also out several weeks because of a lower back injury, is 
improving, too. He has skated the past two days. Don't look for him Sunday, but 
he might return for Game 4. . . . When Rick Sadowski of the L.A. Daily News 
returned to his room in Banff Thursday, his message light was on. "There was a 
call from a Wayne and I can't pronounce the last name," the operator told him. 
Gretzky unknown in Canada? When he was told the story, Gretzky replied, "How 
fast they forget."

ANGELS STILL NEED WORK, BUT DODGERS LOOK SHARP; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FINLEY STARTS OUT STRONG, BUT L.A. COMES FROM BEHIND TO WIN FREEWAY 
SERIES OPENER, 5-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In one of their final tuneups before the start of the season, the Angels looked 
like they needed a tuneup, while the Dodgers handled the curves -- and 
fastballs -- skillfully enough to prevail in the opener of the Freeway Series. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks' RBI-single capped a three-run seventh inning against Mike 
Smithson Friday night as the Dodgers won, 5-4, before a crowd of 47,555 at 
Anaheim Stadium. The Dodgers are 6-4 in exhibition games, including four 
victories in their last five games. The Angels have lost five in a row and are 
6-8 this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels maintained a 31-29-1 lead in the series, which continues tonight and 
Sunday at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger starter Fernando Valenzuela pitched six creditable innings in his 
longest outing of the spring. In throwing 104 pitches, he allowed four runs and 
seven hits, walked three and struck out two. Angel starter Chuck Finley, who 
had been scheduled to go six innings, lasted only five. He allowed two runs and 
four hits and threw 71 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Angel first baseman Wally Joyner remained hot at the plate, going 3 for 5 and 
driving in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Finley cruised through the first three innings, retiring every batter he faced. 
Five of those outs were recorded on ground balls, an unusually high number for 
Finley and a signal that his forkball was effective. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the ground outs were hit to third baseman Donnie Hill, and the other 
was hit to second baseman Johnny Ray. Finley also struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels supported the left-hander with two runs in the third. Mark McLemore 
drew a leadoff walk and went to second on Devon White's sinking liner to right, 
which was played on a short hop by Hubie Brooks. After Ray flied out to left, 
Joyner singled to center, scoring McLemore and moving White to third. White 
scored on Chili Davis' sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
Finley got himself into a jam in the fourth, but resolutely got himself out 
without damage. He retired the first batter, Juan Samuel, but then walked 
Willie Randolph and Brooks. However, he got Eddie Murray to strike out swinging 
and induced Mickey Hatcher to ground out to short. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette extended the Angels' lead to 3-0 in the fourth, when he lined 
Valenzuela's 1-1 pitch into the left-field bullpen. It was the outfielder's 
third home run of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got to Finley for two runs in the fifth. Kal Daniels led off with a 
hopper to short that McLemore couldn't handle, which was ruled a hit. After 
Jeff Hamilton flied out to right, Mike Scioscia singled to right, which sent 
Daniels to third. Alfredo Griffin then hit a grounder that caromed off the 
mound and was picked up by Finley, who trapped Daniels in a rundown between 
third and home. McLemore eventually tagged Daniels, but Griffin was at first 
with Scioscia advancing to third. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel followed with a liner that bounced under Hill's glove, scoring Scioscia 
and moving Griffin to second. Griffin scored on Willie Randolph's liner over 
the third-base bag. Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann went to the mound to 
confer with Finley, and Lachemann's advice must have been sound, because Finley 
got Brooks to fly to right to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels re-established a two-run lead in the fifth. White led off with a 
double to left and stole third. He scored on Joyner's single to left, Joyner's 
third consecutive hit and his ninth in his last 13 at-bats. The rally might 
have continued when Lance Parrish singled to right with two out, but Parrish 
took too big a turn rounding first and was thrown out by Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Fraser replaced Finley in the sixth and pitched a perfect inning. Not so 
for Mike Smithson, who hit the first batter he faced -- Hamilton -- with his 
first pitch. Hamilton advanced to third on Griffin's double and scored on 
Samuel's roller up the middle. Randolph then bunted toward the right side, and 
Ray slipped while fielding the ball, leaving himself unable to make a play. 
Griffin scored to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took a 5-4 lead when Brooks hit a fly ball to right that hung in 
the air and landed just fair after appearing to be headed into foul territory. 
That allowed Samuel to score and brought Greg Minton in from the bullpen. 
Minton ended the rally by getting Murray to ground into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitcher Bob McClure was diagnosed as having an inflamed left elbow and 
was told to rest for several days. McClure was examined bu Dr. Ron Glousman of 
the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic and will be re-examined Monday by Dr. Lewis Yocum, if 
necessary. McClure was forced to leave Thursday's exhibition game against the 
San Diego Padres in Palm Springs after complaining of tightness and pain in the 
elbow. He is being treated with anti-inflammatory medication.. . . Neither 
McClure nor third baseman Jack Howell (sprained left ankle) has been placed on 
the disabled list. "That's one of the blessings of the 27-man roster," Manager 
Doug Rader said. "There's protection and built-in insurance." 
</P>
<P>
The initial report on Howell, who injured his ankle Wednesday, was that he 
would be out seven to 10 days. However, he is hoping to play in Monday's season 
opener. "I don't want to start if there's a chance of injuring it worse," said 
Howell, who has stopped using crutches.

<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Petersburg, Fla., Yacht Club has a narrow overall lead in the Newport 
Harbor Yacht Club's U.S. Challenge Cup regatta, based on the performances of 
their junior skippers sailing small dinghies inside the harbor Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-man, 13-foot Flying Junior Class, Mark Mendelblatt is the top scorer 
with 10 firsts and two seconds after 12 of 18 races for 11.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Davis has nine firsts and three seconds for 12.75 points. John Jennings, 
the club's senior skipper, is in third place in the Schock-35 class with 29 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Three Schock-35 skippers scored wins in Friday's three races. Seawanhaka Yacht 
Club's Steve Benjamin won the fifth race to move up to second place in the 
class. Seattle Yacht Club's co-skippers Mark Laura and Keith Lorence won the 
fourth race, and Long Beach Yacht Club's Steve Flam won the sixth race. 
</P>
<P>
Still holding a slim lead in the Schock-35 class is Bill Peterson of the 
California Yacht Club of Marina del Rey with 21.75 points. The club's juniors 
are in sixth place in the Laser class and eighth in the Flying Junior, dropping 
the club to second overall. Peterson got three fifth places. ALMON LOCKABEY

<P>
Three-time champion Martina Navratilova and teen-ager Jennifer Capriati took 
vastly different routes Friday to reach the semifinals of the $500,000 Family 
Circle Magazine Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, seeded first and ranked second in the world, defeated Katerina 
Maleeva, 6-0, 6-1, in 55 minutes at Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati took more than twice as long -- and lost her first set of the 
tournament -- but beat Helen Kelesi of Canada, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova meets Regina Rajchrtova and Capriati faces Natalia Zvereva of the 
Soviet Union. The unseeded Rajchrtova, of Czechoslovakia, upset third-seeded 
Zina Garrison, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. Zvereva beat Conchita Martinez of Spain, 7-6 
(8-6), 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 14, who had not lost more than four games in a set in her first three 
matches here, is 12-2 since turning pro last month. 
</P>
<P>
MaliVai Washington earned his first professional semifinal berth with a 6-3, 
7-5 upset of fourth-seeded Scott Davis in a $250,000 tournament at Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
David Pate also reached the semifinals by defeating Stanford University 
freshman Alex Hombrecher, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 20, who won three qualifying matches to gain a berth in the main 
draw, is the world's 152nd-ranked player. Last year he was the top-ranked U.S. 
college player while at Michigan.

TRACK AND FIELD: TAC PANEL ADJOURNS AFTER HEARING TESTIMONY FROM COACH ACCUSED 
OF PROVIDING DRUGS TO ATHLETES. 
</P>

<P>
The Athletics Congress panel hearing the case of Chuck DeBus, the Los Angeles 
track coach who is accused of providing drugs to athletes, adjourned without 
making a decision Friday, but asked attorneys for both sides to provide further 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The three-person panel met for more than nine hours at a hotel near Los Angeles 
International Airport -- after having also met Thursday -- and heard extensive 
testimony from DeBus. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Dummit, DeBus' attorney, said that although the hearing had adjourned, 
the process was far from over. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step of what may be a long process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel asked that each attorney -- Dummit and Peter Alkalay representing 
TAC, the governing body for track and field -- provide a brief by April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, originally scheduled for July 11 of last year, had been postponed 
or continued six times. 
</P>
<P>
DeBus is charged with violating two TAC rules: providing drugs to athletes and 
engaging in conduct detrimental to the sport. The penalties for the drug counts 
call for a ban of either two years or life. On the second charge, the panel has 
no guidelines and may impose any sanction it wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The panel gave no indication when it would make a decision. If DeBus chooses, 
he can appeal that decision to another committee within TAC. 
</P>
<P>
DeBus, 45, has coached at UCLA and Cal State Northridge, where his teams won 
four national titles. He also coached the now-defunct Los Angeles Track Club, 
which won the TAC team title nine times. He has been under investigation by TAC 
for several months, since some of his former athletes made public allegations 
that he had offered or providing banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that has gone before, this week's hearing was merely part of the 
first stage. 
</P>
<P>
After several false starts, a hearing was scheduled in Los Angeles last Sept. 
20. However, before the panel could meet, Dummit and Alvin Chriss, special 
assistant to the executive director of TAC, struck a deal. The agreement called 
for DeBus to be voluntarily suspended from coaching for two years but allowed 
him to work with athletes after seven months. There was to have been no 
stipulation of guilt by DeBus. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was invalidated, however, when it became clear that it had 
bypassed TAC's hearing procedure. TAC had established a three-person panel to 
hear the case, but the panel members were not consulted before the agreement. 
In fact, TAC had announced the agreement before two panel members were aware 
that a deal had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
Dummit said this week that the option still exists to seek legal enforcement of 
that written agreement. 
</P>
<P>
All parties were adamant at the time that no side deals had been made. Dummit 
went so far as to send a sworn declaration to a reporter that said DeBus had 
never given information to TAC regarding the use of banned substances by track 
and field athletes. 
</P>
<P>
However, a letter written five months later by DeBus and sent from Dummit to 
Chriss and TAC Executive Director Ollan Cassell, refers specifically to a deal 
in which DeBus provided TAC with names of athletes he said were drug users, in 
exchange for the reduced penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated Feb. 26, 1990, was transmitted from Dummit's office in Los 
Angeles to the TAC office in Indianapolis. The letter provides an outline of 
the precise mechanism of the deals made and the leverage used by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The letter maintains that Chriss, then TAC's representative in the case, came 
to L.A. several times to meet with Dummit, with the express warning that the 
panel members must not know of the meetings. DeBus' letter further says that 
Chriss met with him and Dummit "to get names of athletes and coaches that had 
used banned substances, in exchange for a two-year suspension. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The letter says that some time after the deal was made, DeBus and Dummit 
discovered that "Chriss and Cassell wanted my information to use to blackmail 
specific individuals." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was also critical of the hearing process, which is restrictive for 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the nine-page letter DeBus states, "To show my sincerity and 
desire to rid the sport of rampant dependence on banned drugs, I am releasing 
the attached list of athletes, coaches and officials who I have information on. 
These people have either used banned substances, provided them, encouraged 
their known usage or failed to act when presented with solid evidence of their 
usage." 
</P>
<P>
The letter ends with a two-page list of 46 names of athletes, coaches, 
officials and doctors -- mostly Americans -- among them 30 Olympic medalists. 
</P>
<P>
Dummit acknowledged that he had sent the letter, but said he forgot about it 
because TAC did not respond to it. He said he did indicate to TAC that he would 
release the names to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are so interested in finding out about drug use, why wouldn't they be 
looking at these people?" Dummit asked of TAC. 
</P>
<P>
Chriss said that he and Cassell met to discuss the letter, and he called many 
of its assertions "lies." 
</P>
<P>
"(The letter) was sent to us, as we perceived it, as a last-ditch effort at a 
settlement," Chriss said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Chriss acknowledged that he had said he was interested in obtaining names from 
DeBus, but said DeBus had little proof that the athletes he named actually had 
used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Some athletes formerly coached by DeBus have claimed that he either gave them 
drugs or suggested they take them. Olympic sprinter Diane Williams told The 
Times in February of 1989 that DeBus had given her drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck DeBus gave me the drugs," she said. "He'd come to practice with a white 
bottle with no label. There would be 50 to 100 pills inside." 
</P>
<P>
DeBus also was named in a Stern magazine article in West Germany as having 
advised his athletes when to go off drugs so as not to test positive. The 
athlete who made that assertion, Darrell Robinson, testified at the hearing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has had his own problems since the publication of the Stern article, 
among them threats of lawsuits from persons he named as drug users. While 
Robinson was waiting in a hotel hallway to testify, he was served court papers 
in a libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, a 400-meter runner, was coached by DeBus from 1985-87. In the Stern 
article, Robinson acknowledged using steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson would not give details of his testimony, which took nearly five hours 
Thursday, but said that the process had been fair. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what a fair outcome of the hearing would be, Robinson said, "He's got to 
be banned, harsh as it may seem. Ben Johnson has forced people to deal with 
this issue. Chuck's not a scapegoat, he's part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The case is only a part of a larger and continuing drug controversy involving 
American athletes that has intensified since Canadian sprinter Johnson's 
positive drug test at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
TAC has been under pressure to investigate allegations of widespread drug use 
among American athletes. Several past and current U.S. athletes were named 
during the Canadian drug hearings last fall. Then came the allegations in Stern 
in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
TAC officials met in New York soon afterward to determine a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
TAC President Frank Greenberg acknowledged that a credibility gap existed, but 
promised action. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to do something that is truly enlightened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was more than six months ago.

MELVIN DURSLAG: KELLY CALLS SIGNALS, BUT WILSON CALLS SHOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning it was announced that Jim Kelly had signed a seven-year contract 
with the Buffalo Bills for $20 million, the owner of the Bills, Ralph Wilson, 
followed his custom here of driving to 7-Eleven for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
It costs 69 cents, coming with the warranty, "It's fresh or it's free." 
</P>
<P>
Not wishing to offend the housekeeper, who also makes coffee, Wilson announces 
to her he is going to 7-Eleven only to pick up the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see now," a visitor says to Wilson, "You are drinking 69-cent coffee and 
giving quarterbacks $20 million. Is there any point that can be made here?" 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, there are three points," he responds. "First, it's a big cup of 
coffee. Second, I am engaged in a game in which you must have a competent 
quarterback, or walk off the field." 
</P>
<P>
"And the third point?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The third point is that $3 million a year sounds like a lot today, but won't 
be for very long. TV fees are going up. Players are fighting for free agency. 
The cost of an expansion franchise may run as much as $150 million. If Kelly 
stays in one piece, he may yet be sorry he signed for seven years." 
</P>
<P>
"And you feel you got a bargain?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not exactly stealing anything, but I figure to get money back. For 
instance, my giving Kelly $3 million means that I have arranged a salary for 
Joe Montana of $5 million. If Montana has any decency, he will kick back some 
of that pay to me for making it possible." 
</P>
<P>
"And the trickle-down that will follow?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's the idea. Salaries will expand throughout the league and players will 
say, 'That Wilson is a hell of a guy. The least we can do is cut him in on our 
heist.' I'll get rich on kickbacks." 
</P>
<P>
A 30-year veteran in pro football, Wilson specializes in dubious distinctions, 
such as tendering record-setting wages to the help. It will be recalled he once 
gave O.J. Simpson a then staggering $2 million for three years of labor. 
</P>
<P>
He also made Bruce Smith the highest-paid defensive end in the game, a sum 
reported at $1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But he rejected a $1-million demand by linebacker Tom Cousineau, a No. 1 draft 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time," Wilson recalls, "I didn't think Cousineau was a million-dollar 
player. I was right. He went to Canada, then went to Cleveland, which owed me a 
draft pick for him. The draft pick turned out to be Kelly." 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Kosar, due to be drafted by the Bills, refused to play in Buffalo, at 
any price, hinting he favored a city of greater suavity, such as Cleveland, 
landing for the Bills draft pick Bruce Smith. 
</P>
<P>
And Doug Flutie, whom the Bills could have drafted instead? 
</P>
<P>
"A poll conducted in Buffalo showed 71% of the voters favoring Flutie," Wilson 
says. "When I passed on him, I got hit very hard in the local press." 
</P>
<P>
"For letting Fred Smerlas get away recently," Wilson is reminded, "you were 
described in your town as cheap." 
</P>
<P>
"I rarely can win an argument in Buffalo," he answers. "If I don't pay players 
what they ask, I am cheap. And when I pay them, I am a menace to football, 
creating discontent in our trenches by giving Kelly all that money." 
</P>
<P>
"Is there a chance one day you will do something right?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not likely. People who run football teams have answers to only some things. 
Today's media have answers to everything. And television is making it worse." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson ponders this thought a moment, then continues: 
</P>
<P>
"Years back, TV was known as a house organ, a medium never going out on a limb, 
criticizing clubs. Today, everyone in the booth knows everything. You are 
dealing with guys who are never wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"They differ from newspaper guys who are never wrong in that TV gets to the 
public faster. It used to be that an owner never found out how stupid he was 
until he picked up the paper the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, all he has to do is turn on TV in his box and he can find out how 
stupid he is while the game is going on. If the coach and the quarterback were 
able to watch TV while the game was in progress, they, too, could learn of 
their dumbness without having to wait until morning." 
</P>
<P>
"One would think you would appreciate this express service," Wilson is told. 
</P>
<P>
"I do," he answers. "Learning how stupid I am before I go to bed, I sleep 
better. I used to be anxious, anticipating the morning papers." 
</P>
<P>
"If, say, in two years, $3 million becomes a dated wage, will Kelly ask for a 
review?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why not? By then, the DeBartolos will have given Montana a shopping mall. And 
other quarterbacks will be asking owners what they have in the way of real 
estate."

INJURIES REDUCE UCLA'S CHANCES FOR GYMNASTICS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With three All-American seniors leading the way, the UCLA women's gymnastics 
team had hoped that 1990 would be its year to win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have finished in the top three the past three seasons, and last year 
lost to Georgia by only .05 of a point. 
</P>
<P>
But injuries to two key performers will make their quest difficult when the 
NCAA West Regional begins tonight at 7 at UCLA's John Wooden Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, ranked No. 6, will play host to No. 7 Oregon State, No. 12 Cal 
State Fullerton, No. 16 Washington, No. 25 Boise State, No. 26 California and 
No. 32 Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, seven individual all-around gymnasts from teams that did not 
qualify will compete. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Andrews, a two-time national champion, is the key for the Bruins. Andrews 
is the nation's top all-around gymnast and vaulter, and is the Pacific 10 
Conference gymnast of the year. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA All-Americans Shawn McGinnis and Kim Hamilton both have ruptured foot 
tendons and will miss the meet. Hamilton is a three-time national champion in 
the floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Dolan, a two-time All-American whose specialty is the balance beam, leads 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The West Regional is one of five nationwide. From these, 12 teams will be 
selected to compete in the NCAA championships April 20-21 at Corvallis, Ore.

GOLF MASTERS NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
THIS TIME, NORMAN CAN'T CUT IT

<P>
It was believed that Australia's Greg Norman was finally due to win his first 
major golf tournament in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He had been playing well, winning the Australian Masters and the Doral 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Norman usually doesn't post low scores in early rounds, charging into 
contention on Saturday and Sunday. However, he shot himself out of this year's 
Masters with a 78-72 -- 150. The cut was at 148, and there were 49 qualifiers. 
Norman was particularly frustrated by his six-over-par round Thursday. "It was 
just a bad day," he said. "I felt great coming here and I hit the ball well in 
practice. I thought 77 was the worst I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Then he paused and added: "Can't I play bad every now and then?" 
</P>
<P>
As for his 72 Friday, Norman said: "I just made silly mistakes on the front 
nine. And I made a few more on the back nine. I three-putted the 13th. Nothing 
really happened." 
</P>
<P>
Norman wasn't alone in his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger didn't make the cut at 80-76-156, a 36-hole score matched by 
Arnold Palmer. Also out was the 1988 Masters champion, Britain's Sandy Lyle, at 
151. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle led the field, though, in a negative category -- most golf balls hitting 
spectators. He hit two Thursday and another Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Clay, a local restaurant owner, was temporarily knocked unconscious by 
Lyle's drive on the eighth hole Thursday. Cheryl Lyn Gulley was the most 
seriously injured. She was hospitalized with a possible broken cheekbone after 
Lyle's second shot on the second hole Friday shattered her glasses. Another man 
was hit on the leg at the fifth hole. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, Seve Ballesteros and Mark Calcavecchia, who are usually in contention 
in every tournament, barely made the cut. Kite was at 148, Ballesteros and 
Calcavecchia at 147. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus is 50, but his drives off the tee are 25 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't driven the ball this far in a long time," Nicklaus said after 
shooting two-under-par 70 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus credits his renewed length to a graphite driver sent to him by Japan's 
Jumbo Ozaki. 
</P>
<P>
When Nicklaus played with Ozaki in Japan, he said the Japanese golfer was 
outdriving him by a considerable distance. 
</P>
<P>
So, he asked Ozaki if he would be kind enough to send him a driver that is made 
by the Bridgestone Co., and Ozaki complied. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus said the ball carries farther from the metal wood when it lands than 
it does from his regular driver. "With my other driver, the ball lands softly. 
This one just takes off after it hits the ground. It runs as much as 125 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Floyd, the second- round leader of the Masters at 138, also uses a 
version of the same driver. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy for Jack to have my driver," Ozaki said through an interpreter. 
"I respect him, and if the driver serves a useful purpose, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
The driver carries the name J's, representing the Ozaki brothers, Jumbo, Jet 
and Joe. 
</P>
<P>
Famous-last-words Dept.: After Ken Green got a 10 at the 13th hole Friday, he 
said: "Golf is tougher than my first wife." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he missed the cut with a 78-80 -- 158.

SHOOTER BAKES SETS RECORD, WINS GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Someday, Milan Bakes of Czechoslovakia might find himself the toast of Pilsen, 
his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's finest small-bore free-rifle shooters, he is coming 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Bakes, 27, set a world record in the kneeling portion of the three-position 
rifle competition Friday en route to a gold medal at the 1990 World Cup USA 
Olympic-style shooting tournament at Petersen's Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
By scoring 396 of a possible 400 points, Bakes broke the record set last week 
in Mexico City by Yugoslavia's Rajmond Debevec. 
</P>
<P>
The event includes 120 total shots in three positions -- prone, standing and 
kneeling. 
</P>
<P>
Bakes once held the record for standing, too, but that was four years ago. He 
has yet to hold the prone record, but his 397 in that discipline helped him 
take a big lead in one of three medal events Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the 10-shot shoot-off, Bakes finished with 1,275.9 points out of 
1,309. Jean Pierre Amat of France was second with 1,271.9. 
</P>
<P>
Bakes, a lieutenant in the Czech army, said he was confident after his kneeling 
performance that he would do well. 
</P>
<P>
In the day's closest competition, Francoise Decharne of Moulin, France, won the 
women's air rifle competition with a total of 496.4 of a possible 509. Soon 
Young Jin of South Korea was second and Deena Wigger of Murray, Ky., was third. 
</P>
<P>
Wigger was second after the regular competition ended, but fell 0.7 of a point 
behind Jin in a 10-shot final round. 
</P>
<P>
All international events have added the final round to increase television and 
spectator interest. The top eight shooters in pistol, rifle and air events 
qualify, whereas the top six advance in shotgun events. 
</P>
<P>
In women's air pistol, Jasna Sekaric of Yugoslavia won her second gold of the 
four-day event with a total of 490.8. Hyun Joo Bang of South Korea was second 
and Margit Stein of West Germany was third. 
</P>
<P>
Sekaric, 24, held a nine-point lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
"My final was not so good," she said. "I had too big of a lead. I usually shoot 
better in these finals when I am pressed." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her lapse, she still won by 8.4 points over Bang, perhaps the most 
appropriately named competitor in this tournament featuring 46 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Sekaric, a secretary at a shooting club, said she has been competing for 10 
years. She won gold and bronze medals at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Bang, also 24, and a Seoul bank accountant, did not fare so well in 1988. 
Friday was her best international performance.

PROPOSED DEAL FOR UNITED AIRLINES; 
</P>
<P>
WORKER-OWNED FIRMS ARE OFTEN SUCCESSFUL; KEY IS PARTICIPATION

When Hospital Corp. of America sold 10% of its hospitals to an employee group 
in 1987, many analysts thought that the workers were being handed lemons. But 
if the hospitals were a lemon, the workers made lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, Healthtrust Inc., gave local hospital managers more autonomy 
to transfer equipment among the hospitals and to implement other efficiencies, 
resulting in a $50-million cost savings in the first year, according to Corey 
Rosen, executive director of the Oakland-based National Center for Employee 
Ownership. Today, Nashville-based Healthtrust is regarded as sound enough to 
attract a more favorable rating for its bonds than those of HCA, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all employee-owned companies are successful. Those that start with an 
inherently sound business and not only transfer ownership to the workers but 
give them a bigger role in running the company have fared best, according to 
experts who monitor worker-owned firms. They also have quickly begun returning 
profits to their employee proprietors in the form of cash or stock. 
</P>
<P>
And while the employee buyout of UAL Corp. announced Friday dwarfs past worker 
purchases if it is completed -- it is three times bigger than the next largest 
buyout -- analysts say the experience of the fewer than 1,000 companies owned 
mostly by their workers clearly maps the path to successful employee ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The best employee-owned companies are those that "have combined employee 
ownership with a lot of employee participation," Rosen said. "It's not really a 
question of board-level representation, but participation in day-to-day 
management." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the fast-growing phenomenon of employee ownership say many of the 
plans are designed to insulate management and take advantage of tax benefits 
rather than give genuine control to workers. 
</P>
<P>
But the mere fact of owning a share of one's company in itself is a boon to 
employees, insists Louis O. Kelso, the San Francisco investment banker who 
developed the modern employee stock ownership plan. "The idea is to enable 
people to equip themselves with capital," Kelso said Friday. "Capital works for 
its owners. But most people don't own any." 
</P>
<P>
Employee ownership does not "automatically lead to increased productivity and 
profitability," said Joseph R. Blasi, an employee ownership analyst at Rutgers 
University's Institute of Management and Labor Relations. Employees have 
increased expectations about their involvement in the company, he said. Those 
expectations may be frustrated if the company does not adopt a team approach to 
problem-solving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, more than 10 million American workers own some part of more than 
10,000 companies. As a whole, research shows that these companies have been as 
financially successful as firms in comparable businesses that are not employee 
owned, Blasi said. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a brief review of the experience of some well known 
employee-owned firms: 
</P>
<P>
* Hyatt Clark Industries is no more -- killed by labor strife and foreign 
competition. The 100% worker-owned company was formed in 1981 when Clark, N.J., 
workers bought their unprofitable automotive bearings plant from General 
Motors. For a time, the company appeared to be thriving, attracting new 
customers and new product lines to make a modest profit in 1983. But workers 
were never fully involved in management. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the workers, who had initially taken a pay cut, wanted a raise. 
Management thought the money should be reinvested in the plant. A work slowdown 
occurred at a time when foreign competitors slashed prices. Eventually its last 
customer, General Motors, declined to renew its contract. The company filed for 
bankruptcy and was closed in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
* Weirton Steel -- dramatically rescued by workers in 1984 when the domestic 
steel industry collapsed -- has been profitable every quarter since the workers 
took over. That record of stability is unmatched by any of its competitors, 
according to John C. Tumazos, an analyst with the investment firm of Donaldson, 
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability to remain profitable in the difficult years since 1986, the 
ability to win new customer accounts, to improve product quality and improve 
costs are all important attributes that employee ownership has contributed to," 
Tumazos said of the 7,900-worker West Virginia firm. 
</P>
<P>
Weirton's peak year as an employee-controlled firm was 1988, when profit 
reached $150 million, and half of that total, $75 million, was distributed in 
stock to employees. The firm's performance, even in down markets, has been so 
strong that Weirton was able to go public last year, selling about 23% of its 
shares to help finance a five-year, $740-million capital improvement plan. 
</P>
<P>
Tumazos credits the success in part to good management and in part to Weirton's 
specialization in tin-plate, the material used in food cans, and hence a 
relatively stable business. But, he adds, without employee ownership, Weirton 
"would not be in business today." 
</P>
<P>
* Avis Inc., the rental car company, has made employee ownership a marketing 
tool, inviting customers to step up to airport counters and do business with an 
owner of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The traveling public has responded. Avis remains No. 2 but -- with roughly 27% 
of the rental-car market -- the Garden City, N.Y., company is bearing down on 
industry leader Hertz. 
</P>
<P>
And workers have gotten to exercise their new role as proprietors, meeting with 
top managers on the first Thursday of every month to discuss ways to improve 
Avis' performance. 
</P>
<P>
The company's officials say the benefits of employee ownership are clearest in 
the area of service. 
</P>
<P>
Employee owners, who know their return on the buyout depends upon customer 
satisfaction, have improved lost-and-found procedures, helped design innovative 
check-in systems and figured out how to make it easier to find cars in airport 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: Service complaints dropped 35% in the year after Avis' 1987 
employee buyout and have fallen every year since. 
</P>

HOW U.S. INDUSTRIES VIEW LANDMARK TRADE ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: IN THEORY, THE CHANGES SHOULD OPEN UP MANY JAPANESE MARKETS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME. BUT SKEPTICS SAY IT WILL BE A LONG TIME, IF EVER, BEFORE POSITIVE 
RESULTS ARE SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new trade accord announced Thursday is a landmark move to reduce the 
$49-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Or it's not. It depends on whom you ask: 
</P>
<P>
* "I think this accord will make a difference and continue what has already 
been a process of Japanese liberalization," said William Cline, a senior fellow 
at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "I think it could 
have a measurable impact." 
</P>
<P>
* "I think it's much ado about not very much," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., 
president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a former trade official with 
the Commerce Department. "It won't have a very big effect on the trade deficit 
or remove the causes of trade friction." 
</P>
<P>
One thing observers do agree on: Whatever happens will take a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the new accord would result in structural changes to the Japanese 
economy that in theory would make it easier for all American businesses to set 
up shop in Japan and would increase U.S. industry's competitiveness at home. 
Through a variety of measures, the accord would also improve the market in 
Japan for imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
To be fully implemented, the accord will require governments in both Japan and 
the United States to pass new laws. In addition, the accord is vague on 
significant details -- such as the degree to which the Japanese will increase 
spending on public works -- details that would have to be worked out later. 
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the accord could benefit specific industries. Large retailers 
eyeing Japanese markets could gain from the removal of impediments in Japan's 
goods-distribution network, which now compels an outsider to run a gauntlet of 
regulations and entrenched business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Construction firms and makers of heavy equipment could find new Japanese 
customers under the promise by Japan to increase spending on public works such 
as roads, bridges and waterways. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the accord does not go far enough, critics charge. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Japanese promise more disclosure of the workings of the 
so-called keiretsu, the close-knit business groups under which preferential 
business arrangements are conducted and outsiders are locked out. But observers 
like Prestowitz favor abolishing the keiretsu. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it's unlikely that the accord will result in real improvement in 
the trade situation in the short term, economists say. A big obstacle is the 
strengthening dollar, which makes U.S. products less competitive on the world 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of reaction from various industries affected by the new 
pact: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technology 
</P>
<P>
Japan has pledged over the next five years to virtually cut in half the amount 
of time foreign companies must wait to obtain patents on their technology and 
inventions. According to the U.S. trade representative's office, Japan has 
agreed to take no longer than 18 months to evaluate an application. The process 
now takes about 37 months. 
</P>
<P>
Patent protection for U.S. inventions has long been a sore point among 
technology companies. Perhaps the most stunning example involves Texas 
Instruments, whose scientists in the late 1950s invented the integrated circuit 
-- an all-important component of any electronic device. Texas Instruments was 
awarded a patent in Japan for its work last October, nearly 30 years after 
applying for it. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement notes that the Japanese have already agreed to add about 60 
patent examiners to their staff and are seeking revisions in patent laws to 
permit computerized patent filing. 
</P>
<P>
A separate agreement, tentatively approved late last month, opens opportunities 
for U.S. supercomputer makers to sell to the Japanese government, an estimated 
$130-million-a-year market that has so far proven impenetrable to U.S. 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Cray Research, the Minneapolis company that is the largest U.S. 
supercomputer maker, stands to reap immediate benefits from the new agreement. 
But they noted that over time, smaller concerns could be winners as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Corp. has operated a procurement office in Japan for 25 years to buy 
Japanese materials for construction projects around the Pacific Rim. But the 
Irvine-based company's year-old Fluor Daniel (Japan) has yet to sell anything. 
</P>
<P>
"So we consider it a positive step," said spokeswoman Deborah Land. "We're 
ready when they are." Fluor, with a license to build and a Japanese partner, 
now only lacks a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena-based Parsons Corp., another engineering giant, similarly is "ready to 
go when they are," said Leonard Pieroni, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons too holds a construction license and has a Japanese partner. But, 
Pieroni acknowledged, progress in trade relations so far has come about only by 
Washington's exerting pressure in the form of trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences of Fluor and Parsons reflect those of the nation's design and 
construction industry, said Mark G. Chalpin, spokesman for the International 
Engineering and Construction Industries Council. It will take strict 
enforcement and not just new rules to change collusive practices that so far 
have all but excluded foreign firms from winning major public and private 
construction contracts in Japan, Chalpin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad how often Americans buy off on (the notion) that an agreement 
makes a change," he said. The proof that change has taken place "will be in the 
cash register ringing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Industry 
</P>
<P>
Officials of heavy industry, including makers of steel, machine tools, 
construction equipment and cars, reserved opinion on whether Thursday's 
U.S.-Japan trade accord would mean much change. 
</P>
<P>
Industries such as steel, cars and machine tools have been battered by a flood 
of Japanese imports into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see this having any significant beneficial effect on our industry," 
said William Buchholz, chief financial officer with Cincinnati Milacron, a 
maker of machine tools and industrial robots. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad to see movement in these problem areas," added Tim Elder, manager 
of governmental affairs for Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria, Ill.,-based maker of 
construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Anything that removes barriers to the importation of U.S. agricultural products 
would also stimulate the farm implement manufacturing business at home, said 
Emmett Barker, a spokesman for the Equipment Manufacturers Institute, a trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Banks 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is supposed to make it easier for foreign firms to buy part or 
all of Japanese companies and to open factories in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. investors and investment banks said Friday that the treaty's 
provisions appeared promising but were skeptical that such changes would do 
much to lift key barriers to U.S. investment in Japan, which include credit and 
stock market conditions and the interlocking shareholdings between Japanese 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
American firms see little incentive to buy stakes in Japanese firms when 
Japanese shares are still so high-priced compared to U.S. shares and when 
American firms' borrowing costs are so much higher. Indeed, they noted that 
while few U.S. firms are buying into Japanese companies, some U.S. firms, such 
as Avon Products and Chrysler, have recently been selling off Japanese holdings 
to cash in on their lofty values. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're going to see a flood" of new investment there, said 
Michael Tennenbaum, vice-chairman of investment banking at Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"To think any single agreement between the governments can really change the 
balance of investments is preposterous," said Irwin L. Jacobs, the corporate 
raider and chief executive of Minstar Inc., in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Texas investor T. Boone Pickens Jr. bought a 26% share of auto parts maker 
Koito Manufacturing, but has had to battle shareholders who are members of 
Koito's cartel, or keiretsu, to get a seat on its board. "Changes in the 
government rules wouldn't matter; the government wasn't the problem," said Mark 
Helmke, a Pickens spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
They aren't breaking out the champagne yet, but California wine makers are 
encouraged by the trade agreement with Japan and believe that it could help 
their premium wines flow even faster into the thirsty Asian market. 
</P>
<P>
Japan already buys more American wines than any other foreign country -- $25 
million worth in 1989. An estimated 90% of all wines exported from the United 
States come from California wineries. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important area in the agreement is the easing of the stringent 
distribution system, making it easier for larger retailers to import wine," 
said Sam Folsom, spokesman for the Wine Institute, a trade organization 
representing California wineries. 
</P>
<P>
Rice growers are just as enthusiastic, but probably for less reason. The easing 
of Japan's complex distribution system would indeed be helpful in getting 
products such as rice out to the retailers. The only problem is that foreign 
rice is banned from Japanese soil. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, in a separate initiative, the Administration singled out three 
narrow trade disputes with the Japanese for negotiation and possible 
retaliation. One involved agriculture -- specifically wood products. 
</P>
<P>
Although the other two -- satellites and supercomputers -- have since been 
addressed, no progress was made regarding wood. But discussions are ongoing. 
And Steve Lovett, director of the National Forest Products Assn., will be in 
Japan on Monday and Tuesday to assist in the negotiations, according to a 
spokeswoman from the Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Shippers 
</P>
<P>
For shippers and exporters, the new U.S.-Japan agreement provides for expedited 
clearance procedures so that U.S. goods clear Japanese customs within 24 hours 
of their arrival in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express, which has been seeking faster customs clearances and expanded 
facilities at Narita Airport, may benefit from the change. It takes the Memphis 
company 48 hours to make what are supposed to be overnight deliveries to Osaka 
and Tokyo because it must unload packages at Narita, where they arrive, and 
transport them to a customs clearance center at Baraki Airport 40 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Expedited customs clearances may help perishables, apparel and some 
high-technology products, but it will make little difference for other 
merchandise. "We don't get held up a lot. We don't hear it a lot from our 
clients. We hear of problems in Southeast Asia," said Charles H. Nevil of the 
Meridian Group, an international business management company in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retailing 
</P>
<P>
Toys R Us, the biggest toy seller in the United States, expressed hope that the 
trade agreement would clear the way for the company to realize its longtime 
goal of entering Japan and becoming a major retailer in that market. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Nakasone, vice chairman and president of Toys R Us, said the company 
has been interested in opening one of its warehouse-size stores in Japan ever 
since it created its international division in 1984. Concerned about trade 
barriers, however, Toys R Us went to other foreign markets instead, including 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But last spring, encouraged by a recommendation by Japan's Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry to ease trade barriers for big retailers, Toys 
R Us began scouting for four to six sites for a first round of stores in Japan. 
So far, it has applied with a partner to open a single store in Niigata in 
northern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone said the entrance of Toys R Us into Japan would benefit U.S. toy 
manufacturers, both because they would sell more of their goods through the 
company's stores and because competing toy retailers also would want more U.S. 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Toys R Us officials aren't ready to declare that the struggle to open 
for business in Japan is over. "When our store opens, we'll be ecstatic," 
Nakasone said. "But until that time comes, to be anything more than cautiously 
optimistic is a bit naive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumer Goods 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese trade concessions might not have an immediate impact on American 
food makers and manufacturers of personal care and household consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of these firms say the provisions covering exports will not help 
much since most of the products they sell in Japan are made in that nation. 
"The products that we sell in Japan are manufactured there and are not exported 
from the U.S.," said a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Gordon Wade noted that Procter &amp; Gamble -- whose Pampers 
disposable diapers and Cheers detergent are leading brands in Japan -- has a 
major Japanese subsidiary making its products. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft General Foods has numerous joint ventures in Japan, but the trade 
concessions will not have "a very significant impact at this time," said 
spokeswoman Kathy Knuth. "Over a period of time, however, it could be 
beneficial."

PROPOSED DEAL FOR UNITED AIRLINES; 
</P>
<P>
MOST EMPLOYEES HOPING FOR END TO THE TURBULENCE; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE UAL BUYOUT WAS GOOD NEWS FOR SOME, NOT SO GOOD FOR OTHERS. BUT 
MANY WORKERS SAY THEY ARE JUST PLAIN TIRED.

<P>
United Airlines employees sounded more like tired workers Friday than like 
future owners of beleaguered UAL Corp., the nation's second-largest air 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Optimism was mixed with disillusionment among those interviewed at Los Angeles 
and Chicago airports. And, most of all, pilots, flight attendants and 
machinists said they want their long ordeal to be over. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could go back to before this started, back to when we were a good 
airline," said one flight attendant who has worked for United for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
UAL announced Friday that its directors have agreed to sell the Chicago-based 
company to its employees for $4.38 billion in cash, notes and securities. 
Unions representing pilots, flight attendants and machinists have agreed to pay 
an estimated $201 a share, composed of $155 in cash, $35 of UAL debt and an 
estimated $11 worth of stock in a UAL subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction could mean the end of months of uncertainty and turmoil for UAL 
and its 71,285 employees, with rumors, bids, counter bids, failed offers and a 
threatened proxy battle having plagued the company. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles International Airport and O'Hare International Airport in 
Chicago, many UAL workers were searching for information on the buyout. "Right 
now, it's mostly rumors," said Joseph Santoro, a lead ramp service machinist in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of men and women wearing United wings preferred to say nothing or 
to speak only on condition that they remain anonymous -- some for fear of 
retaliation and some simply out of worry about jinxing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was good news to flight attendant Jan McKinney, who has had her 
fill of airline troubles. McKinney has been with United only one year -- after 
10 years with Frontier Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"They went bankrupt on my day off," McKinney said. "I came to United, and I'll 
be glad when all this stuff is settled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real excited about it," added McKinney, who was heading for a flight out 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic, too," said her co-worker, Sue Srimongkol. 
</P>
<P>
Said United pilot George E. Zimmer, who had just completed a flight to Chicago 
from New York's LaGuardia Airport: "It's long term. Now we know we have a job." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the unions will give concessions on wages and benefits 
worth $2 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based flight attendant Susan Bichel said she has no idea what kinds of 
changes to expect in her paycheck but hopes there will be a valuable trade-off. 
"I think we'll have more security," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone was flying high. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting shafted," flight attendant Peter Basile said in Los Angeles, 
referring to the concessions. "I'm not happy about it, but at this point we 
don't have an option. Somebody else would come in and sell off the assets." 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles pilot noted that the employee group has not yet arranged 
financing, has no equity in the company yet and has not named a potential 
management team. "The hardest part is yet to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The CEO is going to go," the pilot said, referring to Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's 
current chairman and chief executive. "How are we going to get financing with 
an unproven CEO?" 
</P>
<P>
Some employees said a worker-owned United could be a better-run company if 
pride of ownership pushed employees and management to put aside their 
differences. All three unions are currently working without contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it will instill in everybody the desire to do a better job," said 
pilot Chuck Brockway in Los Angeles. "With everybody involved, we can all try 
to work together and get along." 
</P>
<P>
Not all union members are certain that employee ownership is the best answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to wonder if this is the best choice. . . . I'm hopeful," said flight 
attendant Natalie Sneed, who has been with United for only six months. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said she once hoped that a buyer would take over "and put more money into 
the company and make the situation better all around. . . . I think we're 
certainly going to try, but it's limited." 
</P>
<P>
Bichel does not agree that employee ownership will hinder United's success. "I 
see us as a leader," she said. "After the loan's paid off, the sky's the 
limit." 
</P>
<P>
But for many interviewed Friday, their greatest hope was for an end to the 
turbulence they have weathered for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 13 years with the company, and I don't want to come in one day and find 
out there's nothing left," said a Los Angeles-based flight attendant. "Trust 
me, it's been a long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Rivera Brooks reported from Los Angeles and Tracy Shryer from Chicago.

G-7 Ministers to Meet: Top economic policy-makers of the United States and its 
major economic allies meet today in Paris amid mounting pressures for some sort 
of new international action to calm the chaotic Japanese financial markets 
before their turmoil spreads around the globe. Japanese Finance Minister 
Ryutaro Hashimoto is expected to press finance ministers and central bankers of 
the other large industrialized countries -- known informally as the Group of 
Seven -- either to reduce their interest rates or to intervene heavily in the 
currency markets.

Browning-Ferris Taking $295-Million Charge: Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a 
waste disposal giant, announced that it is getting out of the hazardous-waste 
business and taking a $295-million charge against earnings in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous-waste business added 2% to the Houston-based company's revenue but 
reduced earnings by 10% and accounted for "75% of our headaches," John Stanton, 
Browning-Ferris' chief financial officer said. The hazardous-waste collection, 
treatment and disposal businesses have lost money for a year and a half. The 
firm said it will operate the hazardous-waste business until it is sold or 
converted to non-hazardous uses.

Jury Upholds Genentech Patents: In an important decision for biotechnology 
giant Genentech Inc., the company said a federal district court jury in 
Delaware upheld the validity of three patents for its heart drug, TPA. 
Genentech had sued Wellcome PLC subsidiaries and Genetics Institute Inc. in 
June, 1988, for patent infringement of the clot-dissolving drug it markets 
under the name Activase and for the process used to make it. Genentech lost a 
similar case in London in November, 1988, when Britain's Appeals Court ruled 
Genentech's TPA patent did not cover Wellcome's version of the drug.

<P>
The stock market closed lower in light trading Friday under pressure from a 
turbulent bond market, a weak economy and widespread losses in the thrift 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks ended down 4.05 points at 2,717.12. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 622 up, 860 down and 516 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 137.49 million shares, down from 144.17 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors have stood on the sidelines for the past few weeks, accounting 
for the market's low volume and narrow trading range. The Dow ended the week up 
a mild 9.91 points. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things that are unresolved, it's very hard to make any clear 
investment decision," said Joseph Barthel of Hopper Soliday &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Although the overall unemployment rate dipped to 5.1% after nine straight 
months at 5.2%, the pace of new job growth eased dramatically and caught the 
eye of economists, who began worrying about weakness ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks traded in positive territory after the report was released, supported by 
the belief that an economic slowdown could mean lower interest rates ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is susceptible to short-term swings in psychology," said Bradley 
Turner, investment strategist at McDonald &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office unwittingly fed the market bears when it reported 
that the savings and loan bailout would likely cost $325 billion and might even 
spiral up to $500 billion -- much higher than any previous estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Banks, savings and loans and the bond market haven't given any support" to the 
stock market, said Ed Laux, a senior vice president at Kidder, Peabody &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were nervous about the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven major 
industrialized nations, where talks will likely focus on bringing the dollar 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and other financial issues were hammered for the second straight day. 
Bank of New York dropped 1 1/4 to 30, BankAmerica fell 7/8 to 25 1/2, J. P. 
Morgan dipped 3/8 to 34 5/8, Federal National Mortgage lost 2 5/8 to 32 and 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage fell 3 1/2 to 65 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included Aluminum Co. of America, down 1 3/8 at 62; 
Hewlett-Packard, down 1 1/8 at 43 3/4; USX, down 1/2 at 35 7/8; American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/8 at 41 5/8, and International Business 
Machines, down 1/4 at 105 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tandem Computers was actively traded, unchanged at 22 5/8. The stock tumbled 4 
3/4 points Thursday, when the company said revenues for the fiscal quarter that 
ended last weekend fell short of its target. 
</P>
<P>
Software firm Legent Corp. plunged 5 1/2 to 20 3/4 after saying it expects 
quarterly earnings to fall below expectations. The news help drag other high 
tech stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, a growing belief that Tokyo stocks have hit bottom after 
their recent steep declines sparked a buying spree, with the market posting its 
fourth-biggest point gain ever. The 225-share Nikkei index surged 1,029.72 
points, or 3.65%, to close at the day's high of 29,278.78.

<P>
Prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange on nervousness before this 
weekend's Group of Seven meeting in Paris. Traders also said concern about 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's unpopularity upset the market. At 
the close, the Financial Times 100-share index was down 18.4 points at 2,221.1.

Bond Prices Stable After Hectic Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished unchanged to slightly higher after a volatile session 
racked by the worse-than-expected employment figures for March and concern over 
German currency-swap plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed unchanged from late Thursday at 
99.25 while its yield remained at 8.51%. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices shot up after the government reported that the growth in non-farm 
jobs last month was 26,000 -- far lower than estimates of about 175,000. The 
figures implied that "the economy really isn't doing as well as we thought," 
said Mike Geraty, a bond trader with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of economic weakness usually boost bond prices since they imply the 
Federal Reserve may act to ease interest rates. Lower rates boost the value of 
existing bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, down from 8.25% late Thursday.

Dollar Heads Down as G-7 Talks Near 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended the week slightly lower in subdued dealings Friday as traders 
moved to the sidelines ahead of a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were sharply higher in the United States after posting modest gains 
overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at $380.70 an ounce, up $5.90 from late Thursday. Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $380.50, up $5.50. 
</P>
<P>
Currency trading was uneventful. Dealers were reluctant to do much ahead of the 
Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting in Paris over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 157.47 Japanese yen from 157.90 yen at Thursday's 
close. Later in London, it slipped further to 157.45 yen. In New York, however, 
the dollar rose to 157.70 yen from 157.50 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Thursday's rates, 
included: 1.6942 West German marks, down from 1.6997; 1.5005 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.5015; 5.6985 French francs, down from 5.7150; 1,245.25 Italian lire, 
down from 1,249.50, and 1.1648 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1683.

Copper Prices Climb on Strike Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures rallied sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange on concerns 
over the continued strike at mines in Peru and declining supplies, but profit 
taking trimmed prices near the close of trading. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metals were higher, grain and soybeans declined, 
livestock surged and pork prices declined, and oil prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 1.60 to 2.55 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
April at $1.245 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Copper prices surged 420 points in early trading on the Comex before gains were 
trimmed by half to settle 255 to 160 points higher. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Jim Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said the rally stemmed from short 
covering -- the buying of contracts to fulfill obligations made by selling 
borrowed contracts earlier -- by traders following Thursday's selloff.

Colombia's drug barons stated Friday that they would step up their war against 
political and industrial leaders and said their escalation was prompted by the 
torture and murder of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The drug traffickers, known as Extraditables because they are wanted in the 
United States, said fighting the government's policy of extradition was no 
longer their main concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Our principal motive for war will be the torture, murder and disappearance of 
our colleagues," they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the gunning down of at least 14 police officers in the cocaine 
capital of Medellin this week, the drug barons said they would order the 
suspension of executions of police who had never taken part in torture.

BELEAGURED CCT OKS UNION WITH SUNWARD TECHNOLOGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throwing in the towel as an independent company after a disastrous five-year 
string of bad luck and losses, Computer &amp; Communications Technology Corp. 
of San Diego said Friday that it has agreed to merge the publicly held company 
with Sunward Technologies, a closely held concern also based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
CCT also announced that it expects to report losses totaling $17.3 million for 
the 1989 fiscal year on sharply reduced revenue of $61.5 million. That compares 
with 1988's loss of $15.9 million on $107.8 million in revenue. For the fourth 
quarter alone, the company said, its net loss will come in at $12.4 million on 
sales of $17.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sunward Technologies, which reported revenue last year of about $42.1 
million, and CCT manufacture recording heads used in computer disk drives, a 
kind of data storage device. 
</P>
<P>
CCT has been awash in red ink for five years. Since the beginning of fiscal 
1985, losses totaling $62 million have left it severely weakened. As a result, 
CCT is now in technical default of its bank loans. Although the banks have not 
waived the defaults, CCT said in a statement Friday that it expects them to 
approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The merger will result in increased sales volume and a broader customer base . 
. . and with the addition of Sunward's $6.5 million in cash, a significant 
strengthening of the combined company's balance sheet," CCT Chairman E. T. 
Bahre said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls for Sunward Technologies to assume control of the merged entity, 
with its shareholders receiving about 13.5 million in newly issued CCT shares. 
That would give them a 55% majority of the 25 million CCT shares that would 
then be outstanding, Bahre said. 
</P>
<P>
If shareholders of both companies approve the deal as required, the merger 
would be completed by June. Sunward Technologies Chairman Greg Reyes would 
assume operational control of the new company, to be called Sunward 
Technologies and to remain a publicly held company, Bahre said. 
</P>
<P>
Layoffs of CCT personnel are expected as a result of the merger but Bahre would 
not say how many. Once the merger is complete, Bahre will relinquish his 
operational role at the company but retain a board seat. In a statement, 
Sunward Technologies' Reyes said the merger will allow the company to reduce 
costs through consolidation of "administrative functions in one location in San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The losses are only part of the CCT hard-luck story. In late 1989, two of its 
largest customers, disc drive makers Miniscribe and Priam, declared bankruptcy. 
The customers' problems were a prime factor in the drop-off of CCT's revenue 
last year. Also, CCT was forced to write down the value of inventory destined 
for shipment to the two companies, a contributing factor in the fourth quarter 
1989 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, CCT laid off more than 100 workers at its San Diego facility 
and shut down its Tijuana manufacturing plant altogether, laying off 1,600 
there. 
</P>
<P>
CCT has also suffered in recent years from severe manufacturing and labor 
problems at its South Korea manufacturing plant, said Dennis Waid, president of 
Peripheral Research, a Santa Barbara-based market research company. As a 
result, CCT has lost customers and seen its share of the $885-million 
recording-head market slip drastically, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, CCT was forced to call off an all-cash sale of its Zeta Laboratories 
subsidiary to Whittaker Corp. after Zeta was accused of overcharging the 
government on defense contracts.

SUSHI STAND AT THE BIG A SEEN AS A LITTLE FISHY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Famished fans stood in line six-deep Friday night in their quest for hot dogs 
and beer on the opening night of Angels baseball at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But next door at the sushi stand, it was strictly no waiting. The employees 
stood uncomfortably in their pressed white uniforms as passers-by pondered the 
latest Far East offering on the stadium's already multicultural menu. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they loved the idea of having the Japanese delicacy at the Big A. 
Others acted as if someone had parked a Nissan on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, sushi seemed to be on everyone's tongue, if not in everyone's 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Even television announcer Joe Torre noted the presence of the seaweed-wrapped 
lumps of sticky rice and raw fish. "That's class," he said. "That's class." 
</P>
<P>
Most said the sight of "Sushi, Sushi" on the Field Level near first base came 
as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I love sushi. We eat sushi twice a week. But in a ballpark? I don't know," 
sniffed Walter Mitchell of Newport Beach as he prepared to bite into chicken 
yakatori, a chicken-on-a-stick offering. "You don't come to the ballpark to eat 
sushi." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ernie Estrada and Nancy Briggs of El Toro were not simply pleased 
that the Big A has started offering sushi; they were ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't believe it. Do you know how many times I wrote in saying 'You ought 
to have sushi'?" Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, actually he only wrote once, but, as Estrada pointed out, at least he was 
worked up enough about the subject to write, which is more than most people 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that baseball sushi solves a dilemma for him and Briggs. He would 
always go for a sausage, and Briggs would always get the roast beef sandwich. 
Now, at last, they are in culinary agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Angel fans already can munch on a range of fare, from cinnamon rolls to nachos, 
popcorn to ice cream. So why not sushi? reasoned the stadium's food staff. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi has already become a mainstay at Padres games in San Diego, and samples 
were received last year in Anaheim for test marketing, said officials of ARA, 
which handles the stadium's concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
"It packages well. It looks good. The raw materials in sushi . . . are so 
healthy. You're not serving up cholesterol and a lot of fat," said concessions 
manager John Trosper. 
</P>
<P>
At $4.25 to $5.25 for the California rolls -- the only type of sushi served -- 
it is certainly pricier than the hot dogs ($1.75). But "Sushi, Sushi" manager 
Hiro Watanabe said he thinks it will be a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going well," he said reassuringly while gauging public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction that stood out most prominently in his mind, however, was that 
"some lady cried, 'Oh, come on!' " as she passed by the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi saleswoman Lea Sawyer, though, quickly recalled that another fan 
exclaimed, "Oh, what a nice idea!"

CAN'T BURY THE HATCHET? THEN CARRY OFF THE BRIDE

Bedfellows can make strange politics, especially in this city, where Councilman 
Rick Norton said Friday he hopes that his arch political foe, Councilwoman 
Patricia McGuigan, will show up at his wedding Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that Norton's bride-to-be is McGuigan's daughter, Michele. 
</P>
<P>
Norton said he thinks Councilwoman McGuigan will be there for Sunday's 4 p.m. 
nuptials ("Bowers Museum; be there or be square; rock and roll," the bridegroom 
said), but he admitted that "I haven't asked her" whether she is coming. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman voted to shut down the swap meet that Norton used to run at 
Santa Ana Stadium and endorsed another candidate in last year's election, which 
put Norton in office. Their relations have not improved since Norton was 
elected to the council, according to those who attend council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the marriage grew out of Norton's attempt to make political peace with 
the elder McGuigan. 
</P>
<P>
At a Santa Ana Zoo event in October, Norton asked the councilwoman to lunch "to 
settle our differences." McGuigan said she couldn't fit it in her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"But I met her daughter, a pretty little thing," he said. "So I asked her out 
to lunch." A month later, the couple became engaged. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept saying to myself, 'Anybody but Pat McGuigan's daughter,' " Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he said, "I'm really in love with her. She's the most exciting woman I've 
ever known in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Each has been married before, and each has a son and a daughter from a previous 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Norton, 39, said the whole thing gives him "kind of goosebumps. (It makes you) 
want to get down on floor and rub your belly. You feel warm and fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
Michele McGuigan (whose nickname is Tuesday) said the last she heard, her 
mother plans to attend. But as to her mother's reaction to the marriage, she 
laughed: "I'd better not answer that, I'll get in trouble. I love my mother. 
I'm caught in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia McGuigan could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Michele McGuigan, 28, works at Rancho Santiago College, where she is also a 
student majoring in psychobiology and on the dean's list, she said. Although 
her only political involvement there has been in student government, she has 
learned the art of the political response. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she has plans to run for office outside school, she at first said 
"No," then quickly amended it to, "Not at this time." 
</P>
<P>
"With a background like mine and what I'm getting into, I have to be 
politically inclined," she explained.

O.C. TAXPAYERS COUGH UP EARLY AND OFTEN

Despite their reputation for hating taxes, Orange County residents -- who face 
tax time twice this month -- are among the most punctual in the state for 
paying up, a survey by the state controller's office says. 
</P>
<P>
The county's relatively low delinquency rate for property taxes -- about 2.3% 
last year -- ranked it eighth among the 58 California counties for the 
percentage of its tax bills paid on time. 
</P>
<P>
The only big counties with fewer procrastinators per taxpayer were Santa Clara, 
Santa Barbara and San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
Far worse at meeting property tax deadlines were Los Angeles and Riverside 
counties, with delinquency rates of 4.6% and 4.7% respectively. The county that 
claimed the highest percentage of property tax procrastinators in California 
last year was tiny Tuolumne, outside Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is very affluent," explained county treasurer-tax collector 
Robert L. Citron, the man to whom property owners write checks this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
And punctuality pays, he said. "You won't find many large taxpayers who would 
pay late. The penalties would be too high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who miss the deadline -- which is Tuesday for the second installment of 
county property taxes -- face a 10% penalty, plus a $10 fee for processing the 
late payment, Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
Citron's office sent about 679,400 real estate tax bills for the fiscal year, 
which began in July, 1989. The total property tax bill for the county this year 
is $1.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, money has been pouring into the treasurer's office at a pace of 
about $2 million a day. That includes those who are paying early as well as 
those who missed the December deadline for paying the first half of their taxes 
for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
For those who may feel taxpayer blues at the prospect of paying both property 
and income taxes in the span of a week, consider the county's top 10 tax bills 
for the year. They are in order: 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co:. -- $37.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell: -- $16.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co.: -- $14.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell International: -- $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft: -- $6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney: -- $5.4 million.

<P>

<P>
Although they continue negotiating their differences, the city and the 
developer of its indoor sports arena have argued bitterly in recent months 
about the lack of progress on the proposed $94-million facility and what to do 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
The city has complained about rising costs and developer Ogden Corp.'s failure 
to carry out required work. Ogden has countered by threatening to sue. 
</P>
<P>
The disputes are detailed in city documents obtained by The Times this week 
under a California Public Records Act request. Anaheim officials say many of 
the disputes have been resolved, but serious questions remain at issue before 
the arena can be built. 
</P>
<P>
The friction between Anaheim and its developer stems partly from lawsuits filed 
by neighbors of the proposed 20,000-seat arena, temporarily blocking 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"No professional franchise will agree to relocate to a proposed arena when 
newspaper articles appear almost daily stating that litigation is likely to 
indefinitely delay the project," Maria Monet, president of Ogden Financial 
Services, the firm's financing subsidiary, wrote in a Jan. 19 letter to 
Anaheim's chief negotiator, Assistant City Manager James Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Monet's letter was in response to a letter from Ruth. In that Jan. 11 letter, 
Ruth said the city was "not aware of any progress in connection with obtaining 
a team." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth also complained to Monet about the lack of progress on the arena and gave 
the firm 30 days to "live up to its obligations" or Anaheim "will not consider 
itself bound to deal exclusively with Ogden." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Monet warned that Anaheim would be "liable for all our expenses, 
more than $1.1 million," if Ogden is replaced with another developer. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Monet said, if a new developer is brought in, Anaheim "would be 
subject to a lawsuit for inducing . . . breach of contract." 
</P>
<P>
But according to Ruth, Ogden officials conceded later in private meetings that 
Anaheim is no longer bound to its exclusive agreement with their firm because 
construction bids exceeded the original $85-million estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the right to negotiate with whoever we want," Ruth said in an 
interview Thursday. "She (Monet) is entitled to her opinion, and we're entitled 
to ours. . . . We don't feel we are legally vulnerable at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
Monet and other Ogden officials did not return telephone calls from The Times 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
After construction costs increased $9 million over the original $85-million 
estimate, Anaheim officials spoke publicly about replacing Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
"When the bids came in at 94 million bucks, the city was free to do whatever it 
wants," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Anaheim officials, Ogden wants the city to help with the increased 
costs. But city officials said Ogden's $94-million figure is too high. 
</P>
<P>
The cost dispute is the most recent sign of what may be a growing rift between 
Anaheim and Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
In January Ruth complained that Ogden had not yet hired attorneys to defend the 
city in the environmental lawsuits, which were filed in December. Ruth said 
Ogden bears responsibility for "indemnification of Anaheim and for any damages 
and costs" stemming from the suits. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Monet responded that "Ogden has not agreed to indemnify the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ruth repeated that Anaheim wants "indemnification if (Ogden) is 
going to move ahead. The city wants to be indemnified against any future 
lawsuits if we are going to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Anaheim's concerns have been addressed by Ogden, Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a period of time where we didn't feel comfortable," he said. "Since 
that (Jan. 11) letter, they have made some progress on several of these 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
One remaining point of contention, however, is Ogden's desire to get a 
lucrative contract operating the food, beverage and novelty concessions at 
nearby Anaheim Stadium as a hedge against losses on the indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
According to another letter -- dated Nov. 8, 1989, from Ruth to Ogden officials 
-- the City Council opposes granting Ogden the concessions contract without the 
approval of Major League Baseball's California Angels and the National Football 
League's Los Angeles Rams, who share concessions profits. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is, if you are unable to acquire the necessary approvals. . . , 
the entire timing and approval of the arena project will be jeopardized, unless 
this (concession contract) is withdrawn from further arena negotiations," Ruth 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that Ogden remains interested in the stadium concessions but 
has still not obtained approval of the Rams or Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have been advised by the Angels' organization that it is prepared to 
file an action against the city if the city enters into any concession 
agreement which will provide less to it than the" current arrangement, Ruth 
wrote Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, ARA Leisure Services, the Philadelphia firm that holds the Anaheim 
Stadium concession contract, has offered Anaheim $5 million for a five-year 
extension when the contract expires Dec. 31, 1990, other city documents show. 
</P>
<P>
An Angels spokesman said Thursday that the team has never been approached by 
Ogden about the concessions contract. 
</P>
<P>
Approval from the Angels may be difficult for Ogden to obtain. In a November, 
1989, draft of a letter to Angels owners Gene and Jackie Autry, Ruth noted that 
the baseball club has also expressed interest in operating the concessions 
itself after the contract with ARA expires. 
</P>
<P>
While these difficulties have arisen between Ogden and Anaheim, Santa Ana 
officials have quietly moved ahead with plans for a nearly identical, privately 
owned and operated, 20,000-seat indoor arena to be built there. Most observers 
do not believe that two such arenas can succeed in Orange County and that one 
will be scrapped if the other is built first. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental approval of the Santa Ana arena has been granted, and there have 
been no legal challenges to the project, which is a private joint venture of 
Spectacor Management Group, MCA Entertainment Inc. and King-Guanci Development 
Co. Inc. of Newport Beach.

BAIL DOUBLED FOR SUSPECT IN RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Beverly Hills police officer who is accused of raping an 11-year-old 
Irvine girl planned to flee the area and change his identity, the prosecutor 
testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Christopher W. Strople doubled bail to $500,000 in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also continued the defendant's arraignment to April 20. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rush McCoy, 36, of Irvine was arrested March 26. On that day, a man 
masqueraded as a deliveryman with a box, persuading the victim to open the door 
in an apartment near UC Irvine and then raping her at knifepoint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the assault, "He told the child if she called the police he would come 
back and kill her," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne Symons said. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy proclaimed his innocence in a jailhouse interview. 
</P>
<P>
But police, serving a search warrant at McCoy's apartment on the day of the 
arrest, found notes in the defendant's handwriting which indicated he intended 
to disappear and fake a new identity elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We found notes that said things like: 'Move to Las Vegas. Get a new birth 
certificate. Get a Ph.D.,' " Symons said. "If he is able to post bail, there is 
a likelihood that he will flee." 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Jan Heger said the notes may have belonged to someone 
else. Heger argued Friday that bail was already high enough. MICHAEL ASHCRAFT

PLUMBER ACCUSED IN LEISURE WORLD THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies have arrested a Leisure World plumber on 
suspicion of burglarizing homes in the retirement community for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they suspect that Thomas Daly Norris, 49, used his access to 
make duplicate keys that enabled him to enter homes in the 21,000-resident 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Norris was arraigned in South Orange County Municipal Court this week on 12 
counts of burglary and one count of possession of stolen goods. He was released 
Tuesday on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Norris, who lives in Orange, has worked at Leisure World for about 13 years, 
said Lt. Robert Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
"As a plumber in the community, he certainly did have access," Rivas said. "Who 
knows when he decided to start this?" 
</P>
<P>
Norris has no previous criminal record, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Norris had called in sick and had asked another employee to look for his wallet 
in a work truck, Rivas said. The worker found credit cards and a business card 
that led police to an antique shop in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police were in the store identifying possible stolen goods when Norris 
unexpectedly walked through the door, Rivas said. He was arrested without 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Following the March 29 arrest, police used a search warrant to enter the man's 
home and found antique jewelry, silver and other items that allegedly belong to 
Leisure World residents. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that about $30,000 in stolen goods have been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of calls from people about the merchandise so far," he said.

ENSENADA'S POOR WILL EAT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students from St. Hedwig's School packed 800 grocery bags Friday in preparation 
for this morning's trip to help a community of impoverished orchard workers and 
their families in Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth year that the students and other parishioners at St. Hedwig's 
Catholic Church have collected tons of food and loaded their vans, cars and 
other vehicles to make the six-hour drive to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Between 50 and 75 parishioners were planning to leave at 6 a.m. with a 
15-vehicle caravan of food, said James Morrissey, 44, during a break Friday 
while he and students at the school loaded the 20-pound bags into parishioners' 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
The group distributes the food with the help of Corazon, a Mission Viejo 
charity that focuses on feeding the hungry locally and in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, volunteers from St. Hedwig brought food to people in Tijuana, 
Morrissey said. But since several aid groups now concentrate on Tijuana, the 
group chose Ensenada this year. 
</P>
<P>
"These are some of the poorest people in Mexico, almost forgotten," Morrissey 
said. "They live alongside the road outside the orchards, where they look for 
work. They live in cardboard shacks. They don't have heat, electricity or 
running water. There are entire families living in these (boxes) and they're 
about 4-by-4" feet. 
</P>
<P>
Food collected by parishioners will be distributed from about noon to sundown 
today. The bags are enough for about 8,000 meals, Morrissey said. Students at 
the school collected canned vegetables and fruit, and members of the church 
donated money to buy beans, rice, oats, chickens and fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Summers, a volunteer for Corazon, said the people working in the 
orchards in Ensenada live in the tiny cardboard shacks and under tarpaulins 
donated by people from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Every second, every minute, these people are hungry," she said. "These people 
are very, very destitute." 
</P>
<P>
Among one of the luckiest people there is a woman Summers calls "Abuelita" (an 
affectionate word for grandmother). "She said she's either 94 or 104, she's not 
sure," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
She lives with her children and grandchildren, 12 people in all, in an 
8-by-10-foot wooden room on land given to her by the government. 
</P>
<P>
"It breaks my heart to see that (her children are living) the same way she grew 
up," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
Two vans from Corazon will make up part of the caravan.

<P>
Authorities are asking public help in identifying a woman who was struck and 
killed by a car Sunday night in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was not carrying identification when she was struck near the 
intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Newland Avenue at 10 p.m. 
</P>

A County Sheriff's Department spokesman said the woman was white and about 18 
years old, with brown hair, brown eyes and a slender build.

She wore a black cotton dress, a red long-sleeve shirt, a pink sweater and had 
human hair wrapped around her left ring finger. 
</P>

Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Carl Vidano said that the driver of the car 
involved in the accident immediately came forward and no foul play is 
suspected.

CITY OKS $4.7 MILLION FOR THEATER PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials signed a $4.7-million agreement this week to provide parking for 
the Fox Fullerton Theatre, a decision that paves the way for the restoration 
and reopening of the historic movie house. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 4 to 1 to spend the money to buy and demolish houses 
behind the theater, relocate the tenants living there and build a 200-space 
parking garage on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the council tentatively agreed to buy a former mortuary east of the Fox 
to allow for better access to the parking structure and improve parking for 
adjacent retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the owner of the Fox, Edward G. Lewis, must spend up to $1.55 
million to restore the theater's six Italian-style murals and stage decorations 
and bring the building up to modern earthquake and handicapped-accessibility 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
That amount is in addition to the $1.1 million that Lewis said he has already 
spent fixing up the building. Lewis also agreed to pay $150,000 toward the 
purchase of the mortuary building, since he owns the retail shops that would 
benefit from the added parking. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard C. Ackerman voted against the Fox project, saying the cost 
to reopen the theater is too high. 
</P>
<P>
The city came up with the $4.7 million through selling $4.1 million in bonds 
last year for the Fox project and collecting $600,000 in interest from the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have cited the project as an important element in bringing more 
shoppers to downtown Fullerton, especially in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big commitment (Lewis) is asking us for, but I think it's 
justified," Councilman Chris Norby said. "It (the theater) really is the last 
of a vanishing breed in Orange County." TOM McQUEENEY

AS POT RISES, LOTTO FANTASY HAS FIELD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ASHCRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruno Levanas knows what he wants to do if he wins the Lotto jackpot tonight: 
"I'd probably buy a big boat, take a vacation and start making babies. I want 
at least two kids. But if I win $30 million, I'll probably have a whole platoon 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
Wild fantasies of mink coats, lavish hillside castles and exotic worldwide 
travel drove people all over Orange County to buy Lotto tickets Friday, as the 
jackpot was expected to hit $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The prize became the ninth-largest in California after no one picked all six 
winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing, state lottery officials said. The 
jackpot has grown through three drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Levanas, 32, who bought $5 worth of Lotto numbers at the El Gaucho market in 
Santa Ana, said that if he wins he will start celebrating with a neighborhood 
barbecue Sunday. On Monday, said Levanas, who usually dons a mechanic's uniform 
for his job at South Coast Plaza, "I'd go to work with shorts on, tennis shoes, 
a six-pack and a bottle of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zimmerle, 27, of Santa Ana, would want more than an office party. "My 
fantasy would be to rent a hotel floor: 'Just give me Floor 16.' I'd invite all 
my friends for a party, and we'd tear it up. It would be catered, and I'd do 
everything I've never done before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the soiree, Zimmerle said he would buy a new car, pay off the money owed 
on his parents' home and invest in low-risk growth stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Thordarson, 29, a construction contractor in Santa Ana, said he would 
quickly trade in his BMW sedan for an Aston Martin Volante and buy a house on 
Newport Bay with its own boat slip and a "big power boat -- no sails. You have 
to be able to hold a drink in one hand and the throttle in the other." 
</P>
<P>
But his biggest plans do not include such personal luxuries. He said he would 
start his own construction firm and rise to the top in the real estate and 
development business. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald Trump would watch out," he vowed, his $5 worth of freshly purchased 
Lotto picks in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales did not reach the frenzied rampage of purchasing Friday that led 
to Feb. 21, when $68.5 million became the largest jackpot ever in California, 
lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
When there is a jackpot of $30 million, "we almost double what we normally do," 
said Charlie Rich, regional manager overseeing Orange, San Diego and Riverside 
counties. "Things really escalate as the jackpot grows." 
</P>
<P>
At the El Gaucho liquor store, sales were brisk. Owner Tina Soria said the 
store had sold 1,500 numbers in five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials expect an onslaught of buying today and plan to open ticket 
sales for the weekend drawing an hour early this morning, at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We know our players find big jackpots exciting," said Chon Gutierrez, 
executive director of the California Lottery.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Cassady was spraying a clump of weeds outside his Doheny Park Road nursery 
Thursday morning when an ear-piercing scream almost curdled his blood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most god-awful scream," Cassady recounted Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until he heard one distraught man screaming "Mi hermano, mi 
hermano," (My brother, my brother) that he noticed the bloodied body of Juan 
Carlos Martinez lying across the tracks, his legs crushed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was paralyzed," Cassady said. 
</P>
<P>
But he was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the sharp curve directly behind Cassady Bros. Nursery has 
become a train depot of sorts for the thousands of undocumented workers who 
hitch a ride on the freight trains. On a given day, as many as 300 train-riding 
workers pass through the Capistrano Beach business district, several 
businessmen in the area estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The daily train hopping has been an accident waiting to happen, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano Beach curve behind the business district is a popular spot for 
undocumented workers because trains slow to about 10 m.p.h., allowing the 
riders to hop on and off with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m. on Thursday, Martinez, 18, apparently slipped and fell under a train 
that was returning to San Diego from Barstow, law enforcement and train 
officials said. He was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where 
his legs were amputated during a seven-hour surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was listed in serious but stable condition on Friday, hospital 
spokeswoman Nancy Gasho said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was traveling with his 20-year-old unidentified brother, officials 
said. Both men declined interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Sante Fe spokesman Bob Gehrt said the accident, while the first in the 
Capistrano Beach area in years, is not uncommon nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the last time figures were compiled, 570 people were killed and 836 
were injured nationwide as a result of trespassing on train tracks or 
attempting to jump on a moving train, Gehrt said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible problem," Gehrt said. "We try like the dickens to stop 
trespassing. It is very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
The railroad company has arrested 3,816 people for trespassing between San 
Diego and Fullerton stations, Gehrt said. All but three of them were determined 
to be illegal aliens looking for work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what you can do to stop it," said nursery owner Cassady, who 
helped splint Martinez's legs with small pieces of wood and twine until 
paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to get better, it's going to get worse as long as there are 
jobs here," he said. "I have a lot of respect for these people. All they want 
to do is work." 
</P>
<P>
The incident shook up the Latino immigrants who waited for trains on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Cota stared at the tracks as he tossed pebbles onto the ground near the 
rails. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a friend who was hurt here," said the 19-year-old from Guadalajara, 
Mexico. "He lost his balance when he jumped and landed hard. He broke his arm 
and didn't know where to fix it, so now it looks funny." 
</P>
<P>
Using the railroad instead of a coyote -- a person paid to take illegals across 
the U.S.-Mexico border -- saved Cota about $1,000, he estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of paying someone to take him past the Border Patrol checkpoint near 
San Clemente, Cota said he was able to pick up the train near the San Diego 
freight yards with four other men and ride in comparative style in a boxcar. 
</P>
<P>
Trudging along the train tracks near the San Juan Creek, Mario Corral, 27, of 
Mexico City, said he was afraid the first time he hopped on a train bound for 
what he hoped was a better life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"All I could see before I jumped off the train was the ground rushing past me, 
and I thought, 'Oh, my God, what if I fall under the train,"' Corral said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I jumped as far as I could, and I scraped my knees and chin on the rocks," 
he continued. "But I was not hurt badly." 
</P>
<P>
The need to send money home outweighed his fear of hitching a ride on a Santa 
Fe freighter in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the best way to go into California," he said. "It is better than riding 
in the trunk of a car and hoping you are not caught by la migra (immigration 
officers)."

ANGELS: FINLEY CRUISES THROUGH FOUR INNINGS BEFORE ALLOWING DODGERS TWO RUNS ON 
FOUR HITS IN THE FIFTH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this shortened spring, goals and expectations have been inconstant things. 
</P>
<P>
How long should pitchers be expected to go? Who could know? After the 32-day 
lockout, the careful routines and plotted progress of past springs haven't 
meant much. 
</P>
<P>
The goal for Angel left-hander Chuck Finley was to go five or six innings in 
his start against the Dodgers Friday night in the first game of the Freeway 
Series at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His first regular-season start was four days away; six innings would be good, 
Angel Manager Doug Rader said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll go five for sure and hopefully six," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
He went five, cruising along until the fifth, when he gave up two runs on four 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
"He tired in the fifth," Rader said. "But his arm strength's getting close." 
</P>
<P>
Through four innings, Finley didn't give up a hit, allowing just two walks in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
But the fifth inning came, and Finley's arm went. 
</P>
<P>
It was not so very much different from Finley's last outing, when he went 4 1/3 
innings against the Padres Monday in Palm Springs. He started out well in that 
game, too, but by the fifth, he was fatigued. "My arm kind of went South," he 
said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Dodgers Friday, Finley retired the first 10 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw good," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of those batters were retired on ground balls. Two others were strikeout 
victims. Another was out on a fly ball in foul territory, and the remaining one 
on a fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
There was one out in the fourth before Finley was anything but perfect. He got 
into a bit of trouble with back-to-back walks to Willie Randolph and Hubie 
Brooks. But he got out just as quickly, striking out Eddie Murray swinging and 
retiring Mickey Hatcher on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the fifth. But even though it resulted in two runs, he allowed only 
two balls to be hit well. 
</P>
<P>
He got Kal Daniels to hit a ground ball, but Daniels reached first after the 
ball came up oddly off the infield and shortstop Mark McLemore was unable to 
make the play. 
</P>
<P>
Finley got the first out on a fly ball to right. But then Mike Scioscia singled 
to right, with Daniels taking third. 
</P>
<P>
Finley got Alfredo Griffin to hit back to the mound, and caught Daniels in a 
rundown. Griffin reached on the fielder's choice, and Scioscia ended up at 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Facing Juan Samuel with one out, Finley got him to hit a groundball. But it got 
through the infield, barely past the reach of third baseman Donnie Hill, and 
Scioscia scored. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Randolph, who doubled to left, driving in Griffin, and sending 
pitching coach Marcel Lachemann to the mound to talk to Finley. 
</P>
<P>
Finley finished his day's work with the next batter, getting Brooks to fly out 
to shallow right field. 
</P>
<P>
He was tired, but stronger than he had been Monday. And, the Angels hope, not 
as strong as he will be Tuesday when he pitches against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw much better to get to the point of fatigue today," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Finley threw 71 pitches, walked two and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Rader said, he would like to see his starters able to go five 
innings at least. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to see a guy able to go four and not be able to go five and be in a 
position to win the ball game," he said.

BROWN FEELING THE HEAT BEFORE HIS GREAT RACE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: HUNTINGTON BEACH HURDLER HOPES TO LIVE UP TO HIS POTENTIAL IN 
ARCADIA INVITATIONAL EVENT. 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he speaks, his toes tap and his hands wave. He crosses and uncrosses his 
legs. He bounces and squirms. He has nearly chews to bits the cap on his 
felt-tip pen. Approaching the biggest race of his young life, it's fairly 
apparent that Adrian Brown, Orange County's top prep high hurdler, is feeling 
the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The Arcadia Invitational, perhaps the most prestigious in-season high school 
track and field meet in the nation, can do that to people. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is stressing me out," Brown, a junior at Huntington Beach High 
School, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's all I can think about. I think about it when I wake up. I 
think about it in class. I think about it all the time. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:20, in the men's 110-meter high hurdle final, Brown will have no 
more time to think. As he blasts out of the starting blocks in lane six, 
instincts will be his guide. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even been to Arcadia," said Brown, 16. "I don't even know where it 
is. I wake up and it's the first thing I think about. I see someone ahead of 
me, I got to catch him, got to run faster. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
If Brown seems a little caught up in tonight's race, it is understandable. As a 
four-time age-group hurdle champion who started running competitively at age 9, 
Brown has had track on his mind for some time. 
</P>
<P>
He has competed six years for the West Coast Express, a Gardena-based track 
club affiliated with The Athletics Congress, and still represents the club in 
competitions after the high school season. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to Huntington Beach as a freshman two years ago, Brown won the 
frosh/soph league championship in the high hurdles -- even though his times 
were of varsity quality. 
</P>
<P>
But with his sophomore year came high expectations . . . and ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Brown did not meet Huntington Beach's minimum 2.0 grade-point-average in the 
fall of 1988 and was forced to sit out the following track season. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how that affected him, Brown flopped over dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh! It didn't hit me for awhile," he said. "I tried not to think about it. It 
just came down on me, I cried every week. I mean, it's pretty hard to go out 
and watch the meets and see people win that you know you could just blow away. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not a dumb kid, I just didn't do my homework." 
</P>
<P>
Homework, he said, is now his first priority. "It's the first thing I do when I 
come home," he said. "I was goofing around before, going out, not being 
responsible. That's not the way it is anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Which is good for the Oiler track and field team. Brown, a 5-foot-11 163-pound 
body of seemingly endless energy, is adept at not only the high hurdles but the 
300 intermediate hurdles, the long jump and triple jump. Thursday, he won all 
four to lead Huntington Beach to victory over Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
But it is in the high hurdles that he hopes to make his name. 
</P>
<P>
Brown often puts in some extra training on his own, with his mother, Michelle, 
guiding him from the stands. Michelle Brown has sought advice on the latest 
technical information from some of the event's experts, including 1988 Olympic 
bronze medalist Tonie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's been working me out since the beginning," Brown said. "She's good at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Although he returned punts and kickoffs last fall for the football team, Brown 
said the risk of injury has prompted him to give up football. Already, he has 
established himself as one of the fastest high hurdlers in the Southern 
Section. He won the event at the Orange County Championships last month, 
(though he disputes the official time of 14.44 seconds, saying he's going with 
the time his coaches clocked him in -- 14.02). 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Brown says he is now ready to break 14 seconds -- a feat 
previously accomplished by only five Orange County athletes. The county record 
is 13.41, set by Mission Viejo's Steve Kerho in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown is confident he can run in the 13s tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise," he said. "I could almost promise you I can run a 13 at Arcadia. 
I've dropped (my time) like that before. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been under this (type of) pressure, though. But I'm calming down, 
I'm calming down." 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia Notes 
</P>
<P>
Other top county athletes scheduled to compete include Edison's Shelley Taylor, 
who, along with Villa Park's Susannah Thrasher, El Modena's Kristina Dahlberg 
and Mater Dei's Kelly Flathers, will meet the nation's best 1,600-meter runners 
in Beth Bartholomew of Sunnyvale Fremont and South Hills' Karen Hecox. . . . 
Others include: San Clemente's Tim Martin and Los Alamitos' Erik Mitchell (100, 
200); Mission Viejo's Chris Moxley, Katella's Kevin Carlson (high jump), Mater 
Dei's Melissa McDonald, Villa Park's Beth Byron (high jump); Phouphet 
Singbandith (long and triple jump); Los Alamitos' Hartwell Brown, Dana Hills' 
Andy Marrone (discus); Santa Ana Valley's Brenda Robinson (long and triple 
jump); Corona del Mar's Keith Miller (pole vault); Marina's Brian McCaffery 
(1,600); Dana Hills' Matt Jordan, Edison's Lawson Mollica (shotput); Santa Ana 
Valley's Joanna Alo (shotput); El Modena's Mike Terry (800); Woodbridge's Amy 
Robles, Ocean View's Christie Engesser (800); Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer (400); 
San Clemente's Mike Farrell and La Habra's Mark Gonzales (3,200); Katella's 
Martha Pinto and Woodbridge's Cathi Peck (3,200). . . . Chris Nelloms of Dayton 
Dunbar (Ohio), the nation's top boys' track and field athlete, was expected to 
compete in the 110-meter hurdles as well as in the 400, 200 and 1,600 relay, 
but will not compete because of an injury. . . . The meet, in its 23rd year, 
begins with the field events at 5:30 p.m. at Arcadia High School.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY FORCED TO FORFEIT SWIM VICTORY AGAINST MISSION VIEJO

<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School has had to forfeit its South Coast League boys' 
swim victory against Mission Viejo, Mission Viejo Principal Robert Metz said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars defeated the Diablos, 79-77, on March 10. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo officials lodged a protest, claiming Capistrano Valley had 
violated the closed-book procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. Swimming Federation guidelines, a team cannot change swimmers 
after receiving the lineup from an opposing team. Tom Anthony, Capistrano 
Valley principal, said the Cougars had changed swimmers in the 400-yard 
freestyle relay and 200 individual medley relay after lineups had been 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting Friday, league principals voted to award Mission Viejo the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said he has appealed the decision to the Southern Section. Anthony, who 
attended the meet, said he was unaware of the protest at the time and was not 
informed of it until the next day. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Section official said a ruling on the appeal would be made next 
week. CHRIS FOSTER

<P>
Sionainn Marcoux glided through the water Thursday, warming up for the 
preliminaries of the Southern Section swim relays. Her motions were effortless 
and graceful, just a natural-born swimmer loosening up for a race. 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux, a senior at Foothill High School, was in her element. In water, she is 
considered one of the top female swimmers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On land, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You ever hear the phrase, 'A fish out of water?' " Foothill Coach Tom DeLong 
said. "She always seems to trip over something or run into things." 
</P>
<P>
But in the pool, Marcoux has been a standout swimmer since she was a sophomore 
at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she's probably the best on a team that figures to be one of the 
favorites in the Southern Section Relays at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long 
Beach. The finals will be at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've surprised some people with the way I've developed as a swimmer," 
Marcoux said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Marcoux has been surprised, considering that before her freshman year she 
was tired of swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux has been swimming competitively since she was 5. She started with the 
Mission Viejo Nadadores, but changed club teams when she was 9 because the 
drive from Tustin was too long. 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux then swam for the Southern California Aquatic club team, which is 
located in Tustin, for four years. But by the time she was a freshman, Marcoux 
said she was feeling burned out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really going through the motions," Marcoux said. "I would skip workouts 
by telling the coach I had too much homework. Then I would go home and rot in 
front of the television. I thought I had leveled off as a swimmer." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Aquatics Club had been through three coaches during the 
time Marcoux swam for the team. But when Everett Uchiama became the coach in 
1986, the situation stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
"Workouts just seem to be more fun with Everett as coach," Marcoux said. "I 
really can't say why. But I just started getting interested in swimming again." 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux said swimming for the Foothill team has been a welcome break from the 
rigorous schedule she had with her club team. 
</P>
<P>
"That happens a lot with swimmers," DeLong said. "When you swim for a club 
team, it can be very serious. It's not as much of a team event. In high school, 
there is more team spirit, with everyone encouraging each other." 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux made the Foothill varsity as a freshman and as a sophomore established 
herself as promising young swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
She finished fourth at the Southern Section 4-A meet in the 200- and 500-yard 
freestyles, setting school records in both. Marcoux broke Andriane Schussler's 
records with a time of 1 minute 51.69 seconds in the 200 and 4:56.03 in the 
500. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Marcoux slipped a little -- if seventh-place finishes in both 
events can be considered slipping. She didn't qualify for the championship race 
in either event, but won the consolation races. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just worn out last year," Marcoux said. "We had a lot of dual meets late 
in the season and it took a lot out of me. This year, the meets are spaced 
apart more. It'll be easier at the finals." 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux is on a pace to break both records again, which is her individual goal 
for the season. Her other goal is to help the Knights win their first Southern 
Section title since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole team is dedicated to winning the title," Marcoux said. "That's why 
you swim in high school. You do a lot of individual stuff with a club team, but 
you're part of a team in high school. It's a lot more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all the fun was fun. 
</P>
<P>
It was the camaraderie of high school swimming that led to her two injuries. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, she needed two layers of stitches after cutting her foot while 
taking part in a toilet-papering expedition. She cut her knee the following 
year under similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux said she has received a great deal of teasing from her teammates and 
coach about her mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a walking example of Murphy's Law," DeLong said. "Anything that can 
happen, will happen to Sionainn." 
</P>
<P>
DeLong may like to tease Marcoux, but he said that she is one of the best 
swimmers to come through Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Marcoux, who will attend Stanford next year and try to make the Cardinal swim 
team, also is becoming known on the national level. Two weeks ago, she placed 
at the U.S. junior nationals for the first time, finishing 14th in the 
1,650-yard free. 
</P>
<P>
"Sionainn has really come a long way," DeLong said. "When she got to Foothill, 
she was a little tired of swimming. She had that, 'What-am-I-in-this-for 
attitude.' But that didn't last. She's become an outstanding swimmer." 
</P>
<P>
Even if she can't swim freestyle and chew gum at the same time.

BUENA PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The folks who make insecticides, slasher movies and roller coasters have a 
similar challenge: staying one step ahead of the rising tolerance levels of 
their targets, be they bugs or thrill junkies. 
</P>
<P>
When Knott's Berry Farm introduced the Corkscrew more than 10 years ago, it 
gave a new twist to the standard-issue roller coaster by taking passengers 
through two complete barrel rolls. Going upside-down isn't the novelty it once 
was, though, and thrill-ride one-upmanship left park officials to contemplate 
the ride's increasing yawn factor. 
</P>
<P>
So the Corkscrew was dispatched to that big theme park in the sky -- well, 
technically Idaho -- the new and improved Boomerang went up in its place and 
the publicity machine kicked into high gear. Among the park's not-so-subtle 
stunts: sending out press kits that included a box of cookies and a barf bag. 
For those who didn't make the connection came the written warning that riders 
just might "toss their cookies." Oh boy. 
</P>
<P>
Open to the public as of Friday, the ride is an elegant, sinuous mass of steel 
with a brand-new gift shop at the exit, selling everything from Boomerang sweat 
shirts to Boomerang posters. No Boomerang barf bags in sight, however. 
</P>
<P>
And how about the ride? Well, truth be told, at less than a minute it's a bit 
too short to make most people in a reasonable state of health toss their 
cookies, but it is long enough to produce a noticeable wobbling in the knees. 
</P>
<P>
Riders sit in four-passenger cars that are first dragged backwards up an 
11-story tower at one end of the horseshoe-shaped ride. After barely hesitating 
at the top, the chain of cars is suddenly let loose for a 50-m.p.h. free-fall 
that leads first into one barrel roll, then another in the opposite direction. 
Then comes a vertical loop and a climb up the second tower. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. It's quick and exhilarating like the Corkscrew, though nothing 
remarkable for roller-coaster veterans. But it ain't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's time to run the whole thing again -- backwards. Going forward, 
passengers are pushed back into their seats, but on the reverse run, momentum 
pushes riders forward against the restraints. Falling out of the car seems a 
distinct possibility at several points in the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that the disquieting impossibility of seeing where the car is going and 
it adds up to several brief but definite moments of abject terror, which didn't 
diminish noticeably on a second run-through. And abject terror is what thrill 
rides are all about, right? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Boomerang is short, but that adds to the impact. Overall, the ride 
(designed and built by the Dutch company Verkoma International) has done well 
in packing a maximum number of thrills in a limited space. Knott's simply 
doesn't have the room for big, classic roller coasters, so it has to make do.

SCOUTING A NEW IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVEMENT LOOKS TO DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIAL RELEVANCE

<P>
Dressed in their classic khaki and green, standing in a solemn line between the 
Stars and Stripes and their unit banner, the 17 boys of Troop 239 recited the 
words that are as main-street America as a Norman Rockwell painting. 
</P>
<P>
Duty to God and country. To help others. To be physically strong, mentally 
awake, morally straight. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of their weekly night meeting at Wilshire Presbyterian Church hall in 
Santa Ana was spent working on their next merit badges, planning the next 
campout, and being taught the principles of exemplary character, citizenship 
and fitness. 
</P>
<P>
This was, of course, yet another gathering of the Boy Scouts, one of the most 
enduring of world institutions, whose alumni in America since 1910 have 
numbered well into the tens of millions. 
</P>
<P>
And Troop 239's leader, Paul Rodriguez, views his Santa Ana unit as no 
different from all the others. "We believe in the Scouting principles. We go by 
the book here," the 42-year-old scoutmaster, a one-time Boy Scout, said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Rodriguez, whose sons, Ruben, 16, and Anthony, 11, are in the troop, 
added: "It isn't just having fun and being part of a group. Scouting gives you 
great goals and guidelines. It stays with you all your life." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is a shadow on this picture-perfect traditional image. It has to do 
with a bit of demographic reality for the Boy Scout movement in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that Troop 239 is one of only six troops in Orange County's 
predominately Latino areas -- a very small number in the face of current 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
For the county's Latino population, which has grown dramatically in the past 
decade, is now about 440,000, or 19% of the county's overall population. And in 
the Santa Ana Unified School District alone, the trend is even more impressive: 
more than 80% of the district's 33,000-student enrollment is now Latino. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orange County Council of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) says that only 
1,200 -- or fewer than 3% of its overall 48,800 members -- are from 
predominately Latino areas. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, while the Orange County Council has reported steady membership gains 
throughout the 1980s and is the ninth largest council in the BSA network, this 
growth is still chiefly in white areas, not among Latinos and other ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Latino trend isn't the only fast-changing demographic that 
concerns the Orange County Council, which prides itself on attempting to be a 
true cross-section of economic and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's Vietnamese population is estimated at around 120,000, 
there are only about 145 members in Scout units serving predominately 
Vietnamese areas. 
</P>
<P>
These lags have led to the launching this year of new campaigns to recruit 
Latino and Vietnamese youths and adult volunteers. Each of the two newly 
created, countywide "districts" -- the first of their kind for the Orange 
County Council -- offers greater access to staff aides, funds and other support 
provided by the council itself. 
</P>
<P>
"This county's demographic landscape is changing so fast, especially in the 
Hispanic and Asian communities," said A. Buford Hill Jr., the Orange County 
Council's top executive since 1977. "We have to meet that challenge. We have to 
make that a part of our Scouting mission. We have to be able to confront social 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Social relevance, or the presumed lack of it, has always been an issue for the 
Boy Scout movement. 
</P>
<P>
To many during Vietnam-era protests of the 1960s and early 1970s, the Boy 
Scouts seemed woefully out of step with the times. Nationally, BSA membership, 
which had peaked at 4.8 million in 1971, plummeted to 3.1 million by 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Orange County, traditionally one of the BSA's biggest strongholds, the 
membership plunged from 42,000 in 1973 to 26,000 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"Institutions like ours, which championed the traditional values, took the 
brunt of criticism," Hill recalled. "Mind you, no one questioned the 
worthwhile-ness of our work, the positive qualities. But they kept saying we 
were too goody-goody, too old-fashioned." 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1980s, as the BSA worked to update its image and be more competitive 
in the leisure-activity field, nationwide membership again climbed, reaching 
4.3 million last year. And last December, the Orange County Council reported a 
year-end membership of 48,800, a record high for the county. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Cub Scouts (ages 7 to 10) are the largest group with 43% of 
the membership, while Boy Scout troops (ages 11 to 17) totaled 22%. Explorers, 
the career and sports-oriented program for the 14-to-20 age bracket that also 
includes girls as members, totals 35%. The most typical sponsors of Scouting 
units are still churches, schools, parent groups, service clubs and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
This membership resurgence has helped prod the Orange County Council to embark 
this year on a $11-million capital improvements campaign, the biggest yet, 
headed by developer William Lyon, the council's past board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for Scouting's comeback, Hill argued, is quite simple. "The pendulum 
has swung back to the old values, the ones that have always been the 
foundation, the essentials of Scouting. Organizations like ours are back in 
favor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
George Argyros, the Orange County Council's current board chairman, put it this 
way: "Our goal of building future leaders hasn't changed. But we have to be 
even more aggressive in our outreach. We have to appeal even more to all 
segments of the community." 
</P>
<P>
In order to help remain in favor in the 1990s, the BSA movement is not above 
marketing its revamped image with greater-than-ever zeal. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the BSA is promoting a tougher, "contemporary cool" and "high 
adventure" aura for Scouting. In the works is a BSA-produced commercial for 
prime-time television that features MTV-styled music and visions of Scouts 
riding the rapids, engaging in cross-country skiing and in other trendy outdoor 
exploits. 
</P>
<P>
The changing times are also reflected in more controversial arenas of 
image-changing. Two years ago, the BSA lifted its last gender ban: Women are 
now allowed to become troop scoutmasters or assistant scoutmasters. About 20 
women now hold those posts in Orange County Scout troops. 
</P>
<P>
(However, the ban against homosexuals as adult volunteers still stands. "They 
are not considered proper role models," said BSA national spokeswoman Susan 
Teplinsky.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, the BSA likes to emphasize its latest versions of 
good-deedsmanship on a massive scale, such as its newest nationwide drives to 
assist the needy. For instance, in February, in the Orange County Council's 
second annual Scouting for Food drive, more than 15,000 youths collected a 
million cans of food -- the largest such drive in the county -- for 
distribution to 217 agencies serving the hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But no effort in social activism has been more touted by the BSA than its 
expanded "community awareness" campaigns on substance abuse and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The BSA has issued newly detailed materials -- included in the 1990 Boy Scout 
Handbook itself -- for family and Scout-unit discussions on how to deal with 
drug and alcohol use and with molestation and other child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The latest handbook, the first revised edition in 11 years, also provides 
information on how children can recognize, resist and report potential or 
actual molestation situations. There is an expanded section on "sexual 
responsibility," including a discussion of the consequences of premarital sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Such an awareness program can't help but be extremely supportive to what is 
already being done by the schools, law-enforcement agencies and other 
organizations," said Dawn Ahart, past chairwoman of the Orange County Substance 
Abuse Prevention Network, a coordinating body for public and private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, there isn't any organization that reaches families more directly 
than the Scouts," added Ahart, who is also a board member of the National 
Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence/Orange County. "This program provides 
one more significant and trusted source of information to which families can 
turn." 
</P>
<P>
The BSA's anti-substance abuse campaign has resulted in direct-action projects 
by some individual units. Consider the Safe-Rides Program run by Explorer posts 
based at 20 Orange County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Explorer teams, who respond to calls from the Safe-Rides hot line, are on 
duty from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. each Friday and Saturday. They drive home students 
who have been drinking or who don't want to ride home with a friend who has 
been drinking. One post, the Los Alamitos High group, has provided about 100 
such rides in the past 1 1/2 years, including 15 last New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic-minority recruitment drives are the very latest Orange County 
Council effort at keeping up with the times. 
</P>
<P>
A countywide Scouting district, coordinated more directly by the council staff 
and devoted to a specific group, is not new. Such a district was formed in 
1982, bringing together the various units for the physically and mentally 
handicapped. Most of the 1,600 members, which include mentally disabled persons 
in their 40s, are based at public and private schools and institutions for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese district was established in January. Its chairman, Dr. Huyen 
Tran, has been in Scouting for years -- in the early 1970s, he was general 
secretary of the 13,000-member Boy Scouts association in South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
But when attempts were made to form Scouting units in Orange County in the 
1980s for recently arrived Vietnamese refugees, the results were 
disappointingly sporadic, Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems of resettlement, such as language, jobs and a new culture, were 
very difficult and certainly had an impact on (Scouting) here," Tran said. In 
1982, the membership in all-Vietnamese units totaled 400. Today it is only 145, 
spread among six Explorer posts, five Scout troops and one Cub pack. 
</P>
<P>
But Tran and other Vietnamese organizers argued that the chief problem is one 
common to all Scouting units, regardless of ethnic or cultural backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is so busy with other obligations and activities. So we have to 
convince them that devoting their time to our programs is vital to them. We 
have to get the word out but more aggressively," said De T. Nguyen, staff 
coordinator for the Orange County Council. 
</P>
<P>
Another community organizer, Phu V. Nguyen, an alumnus of the all-Vietnamese 
Explorer Post 279, said the program helps refugees to assimilate. "It gives us 
more understanding of (American) culture and how it works," said the 
29-year-old engineer. "It builds a bridge for us into the system." 
</P>
<P>
These same organizing themes are sounded for the Latino district, now being 
formed by a community advisory committee headed by County Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez and backed by key Latino organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino district has a financial head start: it is underwritten by a 
$100,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation. Also, membership in 
predominately Latino areas has grown in the past two years from 800 to 1,200, 
staff coordinator Ralph Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
But only half of the 1,200 youths are in regular units -- the new district 
includes 35 Cub packs and six Scout troops. The other youths are in public 
school programs in which one class a week is devoted to the Scouting program. 
</P>
<P>
Another 700 boys are part of a Scouting-organized soccer group. Although this 
program is not tied to any traditional Scouting organization, it does offer 
occasional camping treks and seeks to recruit boys for the regular units. 
</P>
<P>
"These special projects have been very effective because we're reaching many 
boys who would not otherwise be reached in the traditional (Scouting unit) 
way," Parker said. One factor, he added, may be that Scouting in Mexico is seen 
as a pastime limited to affluent families. 
</P>
<P>
While Scouting is not viewed as a program directly aimed at combating the 
problems of gangs, backers say the positive impacts are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouting has always taught you self-esteem, the value of team work. It is 
crucial that we reach kids at the earlier ages and provide them with the kind 
of positive images and role models that you get in Scouting," said Bob Miranda, 
a member of the Latino district advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we hope that we can win over kids who might be attracted to drugs and 
gangs," said Miranda, himself a former Scout. "We see Scouting as a real great 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
To Scouting veterans like Troop 239 scoutmaster Paul Rodriguez, the prospects 
for growth in the Latino areas are more encouraging than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"More parents are beginning to come out to our meetings. More boys are getting 
interested in us by word of mouth," said Rodriguez, whose own troop, which had 
dwindled to only a few members a few years ago is now thriving. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing (Scouting) grow in our community." he said. "OK, it's not very 
fast. But we're here. We have never given up."

PHOTOGRAPHY: HE'S ALWAYS IN AT THE FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The photographs of Herb Yaka generate an enormous amount of interest. Yet, he 
works in virtual anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Yaka's photographs are worth a lot of money, but he never sells them. 
</P>
<P>
And his photographs can cause people to cheer or utter profanity. But, he's not 
a controversial fellow. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Yaka is the photo-finish photographer at Los Alamitos Race Course, whose 
work ultimately helps the judges decide the winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
Is that a lot of pressure? 
</P>
<P>
It can be when you consider that more than $1 million a night is wagered. But 
for Yaka, who has photographed more than 50,000 finishes, experience gives him 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old photographer plies his trade in a 12-by-12-foot darkroom with 
two specially made slit cameras that are designed to capture nose-to-nose 
finishes. Unlike conventional still cameras, where a shutter opens and exposes 
the film in an instant, his shutter is a slit that is always open and aimed at 
the finish line. In order to make the exposure, the film moves across the slit 
at the same speed the horses travel. 
</P>
<P>
From his rather barren perch five stories above the race track, he photographs 
every race, and the pressure is on when "PHOTO FINISH" is flashed across the 
infield tote board. While ticket-holders wait and worry, he turns out a print 
in less than a minute. Only one thing slows him down: the last horse. He must 
photograph every horse as it crosses the line. 
</P>
<P>
It's a routine that happens 10 to 13 times a night during the harness and 
quarter-horse racing season. As the horses leave the gate, he starts timing the 
race. It's an unofficial time during harness racing, but it's the official time 
during the quarter-horse season. 
</P>
<P>
He watches each race closely from one of the best vantage points at the track. 
As the horses near the finish, he flips two switches and the film starts to 
move in his cameras. He uses both a main camera and a backup in case the first 
camera malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
If a horse wins by less than a length, it's considered a photo finish. When the 
last horse crosses the finish line, he turns off the camera and shuts a sliding 
door across the window facing the track turning his office cubicle into a 
darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
He unloads the film in darkness and develops the film in chemicals heated to 
135 degrees. Kodak recommends that most film processing be done at temperatures 
between 68 and 75 degrees. However, Yaka uses the hot developer to cut down on 
the time. It takes only six seconds to develop the film and six seconds to fix 
it. It then goes into a water wash for a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the picture, Yaka adds a white line to the photograph during 
the printing process to easily see which horse won. He clips the photo to a 
clamp attached to a wire and the photo is pulled up to the five judges above 
him who decide the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his processing technique, the film is certainly not up to archival 
quality but, by state law, it must be kept for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of stopping the action of a racehorse at just the right moment may 
sound complicated. However, it's actually quite easy because there is no 
shutter, just a vertical slit that captures all the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are accustomed to shooting one frame at a time," Yaka explains. 
"Even when you watch TV, it's one frame at a time but it goes so fast that your 
eyes can't see it. It's a continuous motion. It's the same with motion 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"But with this camera, there are no frames at all. The film goes by the slit at 
the same speed as the object you're photographing. All race track photographers 
use the same style camera." 
</P>
<P>
His camera uses a film-timing negative film that is 62-millimeters wide. It 
doesn't have any sprocket holes and the emulsion is tougher so that it will 
withstand the heated chemicals used in development. It takes 90 days to receive 
the film from Kodak by special order. 
</P>
<P>
The closest race Yaka has ever photographed was 10 years ago for a triple dead 
heat -- three horses crossing the finish line at exactly the same moment. Yaka 
is proud of the fact that he's never missed a finish. 
</P>
<P>
Yaka grew up on a dairy farm on the island of Kauai in Hawaii, but, he said, 
"Horses and I really never got along." After a stint in the Army, he came to 
California with his brother in 1956. Yaka studied electronics and his brother 
became a jockey. When he was visiting his brother at the track, he was invited 
to become the video camera operator because of his electronics background. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, after three years working as a cameraman, he was hired by Photo Chart, 
a company that provided photo-finish pictures for local tracks. The company 
worked at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita, Los Alamitos and Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an idea of what to expect," he said. "I wasn't afraid of it. If you are 
afraid of something then it's harder to learn." 
</P>
<P>
He started his own business in 1981 called Acculine Photo, shooting at Los 
Alamitos and the Pomona Fair race track. 
</P>
<P>
After 21 years, Yaka has no plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my work," he said. "I'm outdoors, yet I'm indoors. I'm watching a 
sporting event from the best seat in the house and getting paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
Although a constant observer of horse racing, Yaka never picks winners because 
as a state licensed employee of the track, he's not allowed to bet. 
</P>
<P>
Yaka can only watch and shoot pictures -- two of his favorite activities. And 
that alone means he leaves the track each night a winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Photography Column, which runs every other Saturday in Orange County Life, 
is intended to help the serious amateur and weekend shooter.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: REPORTER GETS THE SCOOP ON FONDA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Journalist and author Robert Scheer is under contract to Doubleday to co-author 
a biography of actress Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect the man who bagged Jimmy Carter's famous "lust in my heart" 
confession for Playboy magazine to write the typical Hollywood bio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a gossipy Hollywood book. It's a social history of the times and life 
of Jane Fonda," said Scheer, 53, a national correspondent for the Los Angeles 
Times and a longtime contributor to Playboy and Esquire magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine resident is writing the Fonda biography with Barry Golson, former 
executive editor of Playboy who is now editor of a new magazine called Men's 
Life. 
</P>
<P>
The co-authors will receive what Scheer terms "a substantial six-figure 
advance" for their book, which is due out sometime in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Scheer said the biography is being written "in cooperation" with Fonda, but he 
and Golson will retain full editorial control over the book's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Scheer, who has known Fonda nearly 20 years, said his and Golson's book is the 
only Jane Fonda biography the actress has ever cooperated with. "That's what 
distinguishes it between other books written about her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda spokesperson Pat Newcomb said Fonda is involved with the book because the 
actress has known Scheer "a very long time . . . and just has confidence in 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Scheer, former editor-in-chief of Ramparts magazine, first met Fonda in the 
early '70s when he rented his house in Berkeley to the actress while she was 
filming "Steelyard Blues." 
</P>
<P>
He was working on a profile of Fonda for Playboy last summer -- he accompanied 
her to Latin America while she was promoting "Old Gringo" -- when he decided to 
do a book instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had long interviews and it occurred to me no one had really done a serious 
biography of her," Scheer said. "They had all been these (magazine and 
newspaper) clip jobs. And she was so forthcoming and candid in her observations 
and at a point in her life -- past 50 -- that she was being reflective and open 
and she agreed to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
The book, however, was not "something she eagerly pursued," said Scheer. "She 
thought too much was written about her and she didn't want the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
But once she agreed to cooperate, Fonda told her friends and co-workers to talk 
freely with the two authors. Scheer, who is on an unpaid leave of absence from 
The Times, said he has interviewed Fonda extensively. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the strengths of my book is she is an incredibly articulate person," he 
said. "She has a great memory, took a lot of notes and is a sharp observer." 
</P>
<P>
Scheer said the biography will be a "serious history" of the times in which 
Fonda has lived and "a critical and honest" look at her career, politics and 
personal life. 
</P>
<P>
"We trace her life from Tigertail Road in Brentwood to Vassar and France with 
Roger Vadim, on up to the present. But it's very much a social history of the 
last three decades. That's the main focus of the book: to write a social 
history with her as the narrator." 
</P>
<P>
On some historical events, Scheer said, Fonda plays a critical role; on others 
she is merely an "interested observer." 
</P>
<P>
"She has just great eyes: She remembers details of the French student uprising 
-- just incredible stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fonda book -- Scheer's first biography -- will be his fifth book as author. 
(He also has edited three books.) His most recent book, "Thinking Tuna Fish, 
Talking Death: Essays on the Pornography of Power," a 1988 collection of his 
essays and articles, has just been released in paperback by Noonday Press 
($11.96). 
</P>
<P>
A Washington Post review of "Thinking Tuna Fish, Talking Death" said the book 
"reinforces Scheer's reputation as one of the toughest, most provocative and 
talented reporters in American today."

LISTEN TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY: SOCIAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE DECLINE BECAUSE THE ROOT OF 
THE PROBLEM IS CULTURAL, NOT ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BLANKENHORN, David Blankenhorn is president of the Institute for 
American Values, a New York organization that does research on family issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people today agree that the American family is in trouble. More than 60% 
of Americans, for example, feel that "family values" are losing ground, 
according to a poll commissioned by Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co. Most see the 
nation's "quality of family life" not only as deteriorating and likely to get 
worse, but also as an underlying source of many social problems. Similarly, a 
Harris poll finds that most adults believe that it's harder to be a child today 
than when they were growing up. 
</P>
<P>
Even scholarly experts on the family -- until recently much more sanguine than 
the general public -- now tend to agree with this pessimistic assessment. At a 
recent Stanford conference a wide diversity of prominent scholars argued that 
the family is becoming less able to carry out its basic social functions. Most 
indicators of child well-being, for example, show that the quality of life for 
America's children is declining. Our society suffers from a family deficit -- 
one that is probably more dangerous than either our trade or budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial question is no longer whether we have a family deficit, but 
why. The debate now shifts from conditions to causes, since understanding 
causes is the logical requirement for offering solutions. 
</P>
<P>
There are two likely competing answers to the question, "What is the source of 
today's family dilemma?" 
</P>
<P>
Call the first explanation "Reagan closed the bathrooms." This label is 
inspired by a trend in New York City: People have taken to urinating on the 
sidewalks. Not just the homeless, or even the poor, but all manner of citizens 
who, well, feel the need to go. What causes this behavior? One answer is the 
shortage of public toilets and the government's neglect of public amenities. In 
short, the root cause is not changing standards of personal behavior, but 
instead those larger political and economic forces that, in effect, close the 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely this philosophy governs much of the family debate. According to this 
view, the crisis is not even primarily about the family. The problem lies in 
outside institutions, such as the workplace and government, that fail to 
respond to new realities: divorce, single-parent homes, the two-gender work 
force, teen-age parenthood, latch-key children, and so on. The challenge is not 
to change family behavior, but to change those larger institutions. Schools 
must help, not stigmatize, unwed teen-age parents. Corporations must subsidize 
child care. Courts must confer equal legal status on alternative life styles. 
</P>
<P>
The main alternative to this perspective might be termed "Grandmother knows 
best." The label refers to my conclusion that you will learn more about the 
American family from 10 grandmothers than you will from 10 family experts. Take 
the issue of single-parent homes. Are they "just as good as" two-parent homes? 
Experts in conference rooms are likely to resist making "value judgments." 
Grandmothers on front porches are not so inhibited. They are likely to tell you 
plainly that two parents are better than one. They tend to say things like: 
"People today care more about themselves and less about others." "They are less 
willing to make sacrifices." "Children today are not taught a sense of right 
and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In this view, the problem is not the system. The problem is us. Parents not 
spending enough time with their kids. Children bearing children. People seeing 
family obligations as an obstacle to self-fulfillment rather than as a pathway 
to it. The source of the dilemma, therefore, is not economic or political, but 
cultural. The problem is an increasingly atomized, adult-centered society in 
which expressive individualism has become a governing cultural ideal, 
overshadowing and, to some degree, displacing other norms such as civic virtue, 
religious beliefs and family values. 
</P>
<P>
Which viewpoint will guide public discourse in the 1990s? I suspect the smart 
money is with "Reagan closed the bathrooms." It's easier to argue, and it leads 
to policy ideas. And, of course, there is much truth in this perspective. I 
certainly wish that "they" would re-open -- indeed, build more -- public 
toilets. I also wish they would provide better medical care to poor children, 
improve the schools, open more drug-treatment centers and help parents with 
child care. I favor raising my taxes -- or yours, anyway -- in order to do 
this. 
</P>
<P>
But I do not kid myself that these measures -- or 100 like them -- strike at 
the heart of why the family as a social institution is in decline. In the final 
analysis, the grandmothers are right. The source of that decline is cultural. 
Reagan can close public toilets, and I can vote against him because of it. But 
he does not -- he cannot -- cause me to urinate in public. Only I can decide to 
do that. And if what we as a society are doing to the family is the cultural 
equivalent of urinating in the street, then public policy is simply not enough 
to solve our dilemma.

REPORT ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with many of the people quoted in the article that single people in 
this country suffer discrimination that is widespread. Last October a friend of 
mine died in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He was an only child, and his mother and stepfather had died the previous year. 
He had no close relatives, except for two cousins, one who lives somewhere in 
California, and the other who lives somewhere in the Chicago area. No one knew 
for sure where. 
</P>
<P>
My friend's best friend was with him when he died. He attempted to claim the 
body, knowing that the cousins would be unaware of the death. He stated he was 
my friend's lover, to no avail. The hospital stated that only a relative could 
claim the body. Of course, there were no relatives available. The hospital 
staff said that, come Christmas (only three months away) perhaps the cousins 
would send a card, and they could be traced; and then they could dispose of the 
body. Fortunately, that happened. The cousin in the Chicago area was contacted 
in late January, and my friend was finally cremated in early February of this 
year. He laid in the morgue for four months, simply because the hospital would 
not recognize a non-married relationship. His friends around the country were 
deeply saddened by this turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the article, Beverly Sheldon makes several mean-spirited and 
self-righteous comments about, among other things, single people having more 
diseases. I'm single, and I don't have any diseases. Surely Mrs. Sheldon wasn't 
born married; did her marriage miraculously cure her of the diseases she had 
been carrying? I think the Centers for Disease Control should be informed about 
this wondrous cure.

REPORT ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the timely article on discrimination against single people. I 
grit my teeth every time I pay my income taxes (standard deduction only) and my 
car insurance premiums (spotless 28-year driving record), but the story pointed 
out several forms of anti-single bias that I wasn't even aware of. 
Congratulations to organizations such as Wells Fargo Bank and Greater Los 
Angeles Zoo Assn., who have taken positive steps to end this bias, and to 
Thomas F. Coleman (chairman of the Consumer Task Force on Marital Status 
Discrimination) for his succinct summary of the problem. We are indeed 
fortunate to have such an eloquent advocate. 
</P>
<P>
The statements made by Beverly Sheldon were outrageous and a gratuitous insult 
to half of this country's population. Apparently, it wasn't enough for the 
Sheldons and their Traditional Values Coalition to declare that gays' lives 
have no validity; now all unmarried people are to be shunned for the same 
reasons: They lack stability, do not reproduce, and "carry more diseases." Mrs. 
Sheldon then has the gall to say that she opposes discrimination! Would she 
have us believe that these assumed characteristics miraculously disappear when 
single people marry, or that married people are universally virtuous while 
singles, whether straight or gay, are of no value to society or to themselves? 
The fundamentalist tenet that a fertile marriage constitutes the only 
legitimate lifestyle is preposterous and deserves to be rejected out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
There appear to be no limits to the intolerance and insensitivity of the 
Sheldons and others of their ilk. These people graphically illustrate the 
depths to which prejudice can reach and how much work remains to be done to 
eliminate it. Contrary to Mrs. Sheldon's belief, I do not wish to rescind the 
benefits that married people enjoy; I simply wish to share inthose benefits and 
be allowed to live my life as a responsible single person without the social 
and financial penalties I presently bear. Coleman's task force has my 
wholehearted support.

NURSE'S ENGLISH-ONLY SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read "U.S. Supports Nurse in English-Only Suit" (Part B, April 3). I have 
been a nurse for 25 years, served in Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines while 
in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
If I were to have worked as a nurse in any of these countries, I would indeed 
have been expected to speak the language of the country while at work. On my 
breaks off the floor and at home, I would speak whatever language was native to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
I work with a predominately English-speaking geriatric patient population, and 
have hired many foreign-born nurses, who when hired understand that while 
preforming patient care and working with the supportive staff they must speak 
English, so as not to confuse either the patients or staff. If the patient is 
foreign speaking, his own language would be preferred to help him understand 
and cooperate with nursing care. Unfortunately, many nurses tend to forget and 
start speaking their native language on the nursing floor. Occasionally some 
nurses are very critical of other staff or administration right in front of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
I have no problem with nurses speaking their own languages on breaks off the 
nursing floor. But out of respect for the patient population, speak the 
language that the patient speaks (while working).

BOB HOPE'S LAND HOLDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Ward Grant's letter on Hope's mountain lands, March 27: 
</P>
<P>
I would like to clarify a few things with Hope's Jordan Ranch controversy. 
There is no donation of land to the park service -- not even 1 single acre. 
</P>
<P>
The developer is proposing an "exchange" of 800 acres of mostly rocky, 
undevelopable, goat country for 60 acres of easily accessible national 
parkland. This 60 acres will be used for a developer's highway through the 
wilderness park unit of Cheeseboro Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this exchange is for a massive, up-zoned development in Jordan 
Ranch. The proposed PGA golf course will be "plopped" on one of the last oak 
forests in Southern California. Without parkland access, the developer could 
not put 1,152 homes and the golf course where 14 ranches are currently allowed. 
</P>
<P>
For the National Park Service to be a party to this proposed developer's 
highway which will move 3 million cubic yards of earth is scandalous! 
</P>
<P>
If Mr. Hope wants to donate 1,000 acres to the park service, with no strings 
attached, then I will be happy to thank him for this gift. Let's not call a 
business exchange a donation!

NURSE'S ENGLISH-ONLY SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Nursing Profession in Need of Transfusion" (Metro, Feb. 25), staff writer 
Kenneth Garcia cites the national nursing shortage as a key factor impacting 
our troubled health care network and presents long-term solutions to the 
problem (i.e, better pay, upgrade in status, improved working conditions). 
Garcia, however, neglects to identify a primary impediment to the immediate 
improvement of this state of affairs, namely the absence of congressional 
action to change our immigration laws to allow a flow of highly qualified and 
dedicated foreign nurses to enter the U.S. medical system now -- before matters 
worsen. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that squelches overt accusations of apathy on its part, the U.S. 
House Immigration Subcommittee enacted the Immigration Nursing Relief Act in 
September, 1989. The bill purports to relieve short-term needs by allowing a 
restricted cadre of foreign nurses to adjust their status on temporary H-1 
visas while maintaining a 6-year cap to their stay. 
</P>
<P>
What has received little if any attention, though, is the unprecedented 
administrative and financial burdens imposed on our already overburdened 
health-care providers if they turn toward foreign recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, the bill requires that a series of annual attestations be filed 
documenting the institutions' efforts to fill nurse quotas with U.S. citizens. 
Some of the requirements are laudable, such as the required 
hospital-administered training programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is beyond sound economic reasoning, however, that the bill demands that our 
hospitals first offer U.S. RN's salary compensation above prevailing local 
rates. Similarly unjustified is the INS disclosure that this is "not to be 
considered an exclusive list of requirements" after all. So go ahead, buddy. 
Take your chances. 
</P>
<P>
Before a labor-strapped institution can access the substantial foreign-born 
nurse pool, it must also consider that these attestations are considered public 
documents and are therefore open to the scrutiny and investigation of the U.S. 
Department of Labor. Projecting this precariousness further, unions and other 
"aggrieved" parties are welcome to file complaints and demand administrative 
hearings regarding those grievances -- subjecting the hospital to the 
possibility of civil monetary penalties and administrative sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the overall effect is further deterioration of the nursing crisis by 
making it more difficult -- and tenuous -- to petition for foreign-born 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
While improved wages and working conditions will help revive the U.S. nursing 
profession for the long-haul, legal immigration reform must be instituted if 
our health-care needs are to be met adequately in the not-so-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
Considering what's at risk, we owe it to ourselves to support our medical 
institutions in making this clear to Congress.

REPORT ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discrimination against singles? Wait a minute! Let's look at this from another 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
The strength and stability of our society comes from our families. 
</P>
<P>
As a society we have very good reasons for encouraging people to marry and stay 
married. Is this necessarily discrimination against singles? 
</P>
<P>
The insurance companies, quoted in your article, have given a good reason for 
giving rate preference to married people; married people on the average have 
better driving records. Insurance companies are not going to simply lower the 
rates for single people, they will raise the rates for married people to 
compensate for the higher claims made by singles. Is this fair? 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at the statistics given, unmarried-55%, married-45%. According to 
the article, these figures were based on the Census Bureau's definition of 
"marrying age" as 15 years or older. Just how many 15 year olds do you know who 
are married? I would imagine that if this figure were adjusted to age 20 (which 
is still young for marriage considering the trend toward later marriages), the 
percentage would drop considerably. A more realistic percentage of unmarried is 
probably less than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, let's stop and think sensibly about this issue from both the 
married and the single point of view. Do we have good reasons for giving 
preference in certain situations to married people? I think we do. Is this 
necessarily discrimination?
