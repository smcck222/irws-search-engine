AL MARTINEZ: HOOKING INTO A CONVERTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It seemed easy enough when Eddie explained it at the shop. 
</P>
<P>
"All you do," he said, "is connect the converter box to your VCR and the VCR to 
the TV set." He repeated it slowly: "The box to the VCR, the VCR to the TV." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie gave it a kind of lilting cadence as though at any moment he might break 
into song, the way they did in the old MGM musicals. 
</P>
<P>
He studied my eyes for a few seconds in a searching effort to determine if I 
knew what he was saying. Then he said, "That doesn't seem so difficult now does 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
Eddie was perceptive. He seemed to understand instinctively that if I squinted 
or if my gaze took on a slightly myopic look I had missed everything. 
</P>
<P>
"No," I said. "The box to the VCR and the VCR to the TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Right," Eddie said. "'Now go home and give it what-for." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie worked for Falcon Cable TV, the company that allows us to view television 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. Recently, Falcon instituted a new, improved 
system that not only allows us to watch essentially the same number of channels 
but also allows us to pay almost twice as much for the service. 
</P>
<P>
And it loaned me converter boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"What do they do?" my wife asked when I brought the boxes home. 
</P>
<P>
"They convert," I said. "It has something to do with free-flowing ions, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
"And you have to connect them? I'm getting out of here." 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy. The box to the VCR and the VCR to the TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Which one do you plug into the wall?" she asked. "There are three cords. One 
from the box, one from the VCR and one from the TV." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember Eddie telling me about that. But he did give me a diagram and 
some easy-to-follow written instructions." 
</P>
<P>
I read from the easy-to-follow instructions: "Cable from wall to converter 
'input' then converter 'output' to 'cable in' or 'antenna in' -- then 'antenna 
out' or 'cable out' or 'to TV' to TV set." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't say which electrical cord you plug into the wall," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a picture," I said irritably. "You plug the TV into the converter box 
and you plug the converter box and the VCR into the wall. There's a little 
drawing of a wall socket and an arrow. Nothing to it." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you said when you fixed the toilet but we still have to jiggle the 
handle." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a faulty toilet." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a faulty toilet fixer." 
</P>
<P>
I labored for two hours trying to hook into the system. Cable from wall to box 
input. Cable from box output to VCR input. Cable from VCR output to TV antenna 
input (VHF). It should have worked. It didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"So," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
She has a way of using that one word with just the right tilt to encompass a 
plethora of attitudes and emotions. She says "so," but what she's thinking is, 
"it's the old jiggle-the-toilet-handle routine all over again." 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared to start to work once," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then, that ought to hold us for the rest of the season. Do we jiggle the 
handle?" 
</P>
<P>
The next morning I called Falcon Cable. Our monthly charge had gone up while 
our system had been complicated beyond belief. Falcon owed me hook-up help. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, Elmer," the lady who answered the phone said, "but there's no one 
here. I'll take your number." 
</P>
<P>
I tend to mumble at times of stress. She thought I had said my name was Elmer 
Teenez. No one called back. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because they checked their records and they have no Elmer Teenez as a 
customer," my wife said. "I've never met anyone else who couldn't say their own 
name. Let's try it together. Al (pause) Mar-teen-ez." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie had made the off-hand comment that if I needed help, just call. So I 
called. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he said, "it's really easy to do, but I guess I can come out after 
work." There was pain in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really appreciate it," I said. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie is one of those nice guys who can't say no. Guys like me who whine to get 
our way count on that. 
</P>
<P>
"You have no pride," my wife said when I hung up. 
</P>
<P>
"Pride goeth before the fall," I said. "Or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
It took Eddie mere seconds to make everything work. "See," he said, hands 
flying over the tangle of cords and plugs, "it's a snap." 
</P>
<P>
"You did exactly what I did," I said. "Why didn't it work for me?" 
</P>
<P>
As I sit here writing I can hear the TV set working in another room. I can also 
hear the toilet running. Excuse me while I go jiggle the handle.

NO TIME TO CHANGE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newest peace-keeping operation of the United Nations, this one in Namibia, 
has had a tragic start for which many must share responsibility. Chaotic and 
confused as the situation is, however, there is nothing to justify South 
Africa's threat to nullify the international agreement that the peace force is 
to implement. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the problem was a decision to go ahead with the April 1 
implementation of the independence plan for Namibia despite irritating delays 
among haggling United Nations members, some of them more concerned about 
cost-cutting than peace-making. Those delays denied the staff time to put in 
place an adequate peace-keeping force. The risk of that decision became clear 
in the first hours after the agreement came into force, when heavily armed 
members of the South-West People's Organization (SWAPO) started a major 
movement within Namibia, some reportedly from their bases in Angola in 
violation of the terms of the agreement. Their return to their native land was 
to have been made in May under careful supervision that would have included 
disarmament measures. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has been ruling the vast territory illegally, found its 
police overwhelmed. The U.N. Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) was equally 
overwhelmed, with only 921 of the 4,650-member peace-keeping force in place, 
and they without adequate transport and communications. So South Africa was 
authorized by the U.N. commander to mobilize military units that had returned 
to barracks under the peace agreement, and they joined the police in resisting 
the incursion. A battle raged that has taken more than 200 lives, most of them 
Namibians whose primary objective appeared to be a celebration of the 
approaching independence of their nation. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Nujoma, leader of SWAPO, the guerrilla movement, has sought to place all 
the blame on the United Nations and on the South African forces. But the role 
of his field commanders in encouraging this violation of the carefully crafted 
peace agreement will only make more difficult the restoration of confidence as 
Namibia moves toward free elections. There may indeed have been an overreaction 
by the South African units to the incursion, which seems to have involved no 
acts of aggression initially and no more than 2,000 men. But those who crossed 
from Angola were, in fact, in violation, and at least the SWAPO leaders knew 
that. Only time will permit a fair judgment of the decision by the U.N. 
commander to authorize the South Africans to leave their barracks and resist 
the incursion. 
</P>
<P>
But the task now is not to abandon the plan to bring Namibia to independence at 
long last. The task is to repair the peace plan, get it back on schedule and 
clear the way for elections at the end of this year. South Africa is wrong in 
arguing that the election schedule cannot be met. SWAPO can contribute 
significantly to the restoration of the timetable by seeing that there is 
absolute respect of the agreement now. The United States has an important role 
as well. So far, most of the American share of the peace-keeping operation is 
locked up in congressional budget balancing, which is imperiled by the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings rules. President Bush's commitment to prompt and full 
funding needs now to be matched by a commitment from congressional leaders who, 
like the President, must realize that this assessment of $129 million is small 
by comparison with the cost of a failed mission and a foiled peace plan.

I find it ironic that The Times has endorsed Mayor Bradley for reelection and 
then in the same editorial pointed out how ineffective Bradley has been in 
dealing with the many problems that are choking this once fine city of ours. In 
backing Bradley and, for that matter, all the incumbent city councilmen, aren't 
you taking a chance that we will be faced with nothing more than four more 
years of status quo?

CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial attacks the Capital Research Center for its study of corporate 
contributions to groups which seek to undermine the system of free enterprise 
that has given America peace, prosperity and freedom. As the author of the 
preface to that book, I feel compelled to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial attacks this book as an "exercise of the radical right," of 
which I am presumably a representative. I don't know what you mean by "radical" 
in this context. My views on the role of corporations in society and on many 
other subjects are well known, and mainstream enough that my book, "A Time for 
Truth," spent the better part of a year on the best-seller lists. Can a defense 
of individual liberty and our free enterprise system be called extreme? I don't 
think so, and I doubt the people who read my book -- or indeed most other 
Americans -- consider my views very radical. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that many business leaders are quite clearly feeding the mouth that 
bites them. They are financing advocacy groups which see free enterprise as the 
enemy of the people, which believe that government can make decisions better 
than individuals, and which think that "group rights" count for more than the 
rights of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
I have recommended for years that corporations wishing to promote peace, a 
clean environment and sound race relations, for instance, steer their gifts to 
organizations whose work in these fields is consistent with both the 
aspirations of our people and the survival of our free enterprise system. To 
declaim such views as representative of the "radical right" simply shows the 
ease and abandon with which your editorial writers label people whose views 
they happen to dislike.

EXXON OIL SPILL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the increases in wholesale gasoline prices charged by the oil 
companies as a direct result of the Alaskan oil spill, I am impressed with how 
quickly these companies can now respond to fluctuations in the marketplace: 
mere days! 
</P>
<P>
Why, just three years ago, when crude oil dropped below $10 a barrel, it took 
up to six months before those suddenly lowered costs were passed on to 
consumers. At that time, the oil companies stated that this delay was due to 
gasoline prices being dependent on outstanding contracts that were based on 
older higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
My hearty congratulations to these companies for increasing their efficiency so 
as to ensure that consumers are paying pump prices that accurately reflect the 
fair-market price of oil in effect at that time. I'll be looking forward to 
instantaneous drops in gasoline prices once oil tankers can resume shipments 
from Alaska.

EXXON OIL SPILL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago it was decided after considerable debate that there was a 
compelling reason to drill for Alaskan crude oil and build a pipeline to the 
south. The system has worked well for nearly two decades. The tanker disaster 
will have long-range consequences. 
</P>
<P>
However, the need for Alaskan crude remains and the companies operating the 
system have to be even more vigilant in the pipeline and tanker shipments to 
preclude having another similar disaster. Considering the large number of 
supertankers plying the oceans today, the rarity of a spill is a wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Let the accidents of Torrey Canyon, Santa Barbara Channel, Gulf of Mexico and 
North Sea platform failures, and other spills remind us of the world we live 
in. We need oil to fuel much of the world's economies. And there is no 100% 
safe way of extracting it, shipping, and using it. But let's at least strive 
for 100%.

<P>
In response to Sen. Frank Murkowski's (R-Alaska) column "Don't Shut Alaska's 
Oil Spigot," Op-Ed Page, April 2: 
</P>
<P>
I am appalled that the senator tells us how fortunate we are that not all of 
the oil contained on the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled into Prince William Sound. 
He further states that Exxon has now accepted full responsibility and has 
committed to pay for the cleanup and full reimbursement for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
Does the senator really believe that Exxon's dollars will restore the lives of 
the countless birds and marine mammals which have died and will die, restore 
the damage to the ecosystem, the fishing industry so vital to the people of 
this area, or the pristine beauty of the sound itself? 
</P>
<P>
Murkowski, in agreement with President Bush, says there is no real connection 
between the recent accident and further drilling and exploration for oil in the 
Alaskan wilderness. Neither he nor President Bush seem to consider that further 
intrusion into this magnificent land will inevitably affect the environment and 
the wildlife now existing there, which dollars cannot replenish. 
</P>
<P>
Would it not be to the benefit of all life if Exxon dollars were used to 
develop alternative sources of energy which will not continue to pollute the 
earth, seas and skies, either by their use or such accidents as the one which 
has just occurred?

<P>
It's incredible that the oil industry has been so irresponsible in its response 
to the country's largest and most environmentally threatening tanker oil spill. 
All the advertising and public relations efforts have not overcome the 
industry's inability to carry out the promises that it made to assure effective 
response to such events. The industry has argued that its expertise and 
improvements in technology would prevent the sort of catastrophe that we saw in 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
A nightmare seems to be passing before us, a President and secretary of 
interior pushing for leasing of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (perhaps 
the most sensitive ecosystem in the nation) for oil development, an industry 
promising environmental protection we know is not possible, and a failure to 
address energy issues in a reasonable manner. 
</P>
<P>
The whole coastline of California is being readied for leasing for oil and gas 
development. Local governments from San Diego to Mendocino have opposed 
offshore leasing for reasons that have so unfortunately come to pass in Alaska. 
It's time for the federal government to stop promoting oil development and 
favor other conservation and alternative fuel sources.

Murkowski's column confirms the shameful fact that we are a nation of oil 
junkies. We are willing to spoil pristine wilderness, destroy innocent wildlife 
and befoul our atmosphere with lung-choking hydrocarbons to feed our habit. 
</P>
<P>
If we stop pulling oil from Alaska we do not have to get it from foreign oil 
pushers. What we do have to do is embark on a national program of increased 
energy efficiency and alternative energy sources. The possibilities are there, 
all we need is a little imaginative leadership. All we need to do is stare the 
oil conglomerates in the eye and "just say no."

HERE'S ONE VOTE FOR CONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't help but notice that two readers wrote that Pete Rose should be 
inducted into Baseball's Hall of Fame regardless of whether he bet on baseball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Where were those letter writers 70 years ago when Joe Jackson needed them? 
Jackson batted .356 in his career and makes Rose look like a bush leaguer. Yet 
he and seven Chicago White Sox teammates got lifetime banishments for fixing 
the 1919 World Series -- ironically, against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson hit .375 in the Series he was supposedly trying to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, yes, no question; but Jackson, no way? With such a confused moral 
position, is it any wonder Steve Garvey and Wade Boggs are in such a mess?

YACHT CLUB SHOULD GIVE UP THE CUP, THEN WIN IT BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the San Diego Yacht Club goes ahead and appeals the recent decision that 
stripped it of the America's Cup, it will be a terrible and expensive mistake. 
The interpretation of the 100-year-old Deed of Gift should be left to 
historians, not lawyers. And, if you'll remember, it was their lawyers who said 
they were on solid legal ground in racing a catamaran. The appeal will be a 
divisive and wasteful exercise, and no matter what kind of case they bring to 
the New York Appeals Court, they will never win. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has the greatest sailor in the world, so why fight for the Cup in a 
New York courtroom? If the New Zealand yachters want to celebrate and cherish a 
prize they didn't earn on the water, then fly the damned thing over there 
tomorrow and give it to them and show the world that San Diego thinks more 
about fair play and hard work than it cares about the politics of rule-making.

SOMETHING MISSING FROM MICHIGAN WIN IN NCAA PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan won the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship by overcoming 
the added pressure of going through the basketball playoffs with an assistant 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
But in all the TV hoopla, there was no mention of Bill Frieder, the coach who 
brought them there. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Downey really captured the situation in his column the morning after. Can 
you imagine the agony Frieder had gone through the last few weeks? And to have 
to watch the final in a hotel room on TV? I was awfully disappointed to hear 
not one word from Steve Fisher crediting Frieder with any contribution to the 
success of the Michigan team when Fisher accepted the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
The real heels are the Arizona State group who forced Frieder to sign under an 
unrealistic deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Such a bittersweet win for Michigan.

PUTTING STUDENT BEFORE ATHLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Americans believe major colleges athletics lack integrity. There is an 
easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
Make the number of new scholarships available for next year equal to the number 
of players graduating this year. If four basketball players graduate, four 
scholarships can be awarded. If none graduate, the college better pray for some 
highly talented walk-ons, real "student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, John Thompson's program at Georgetown won't skip a beat. He 
graduates (almost) all of his players. 
</P>
<P>
But some programs could be wiped out overnight. Fair enough. Those schools that 
benefited from recruiting and other NCAA rules violations would then pay for 
their transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, maybe a few major college coaches, besides Thompson, would be 
concerned about the education of their athletes after their athletic 
eligibility ends.

HOMERS LIFT CSUN OVER CAL POLY SLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge hitters played a version of follow the leader Friday 
afternoon during a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game against 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Held in check for the first three innings by Mustang starter Keith Chura, 
Northridge's Ted Weisfuss led off the fourth with a home run, which was 
followed by a Craig Clayton double, a home run by Chae-Ho Chong and consecutive 
singles by Rusty McLain and J.D. Haendiges. 
</P>
<P>
The five-hit, three-run rally was the first of three productive innings for 
Northridge as the Matadors defeated San Luis Obispo, 10-3, in the opener of a 
three-game series at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ranked 14th in Division II, improved to 17-10-1 overall and 7-6-1 
in conference play. Eighth-ranked San Luis Obispo is 18-17 and 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
"They're (Northridge) very young and when somebody hits the ball hard, they get 
all excited and think, 'Well heck, why can't I do the same thing?' " said San 
Luis Obispo Coach Steve McFarland, whose team entered the game atop the 
conference standings with a half-game lead over Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's 13-hit attack featured four home runs, including two by Chong, who 
has recovered from a slow start to raise his average to .320. 
</P>
<P>
"The air was so thin and so hot today, you just put it up in the jet stream and 
it was going," said Chong, who also had a single. "I feel like I was in a slump 
at the beginning of the year. Now, I feel like I'm getting back in the groove." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge pitcher Fili Martinez maintained his season-long groove with his 
fifth complete game. The senior left-hander surrendered eight hits, struck out 
eight and walked just one batter to improve his record to a misleading 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he did in his last start against USC, Martinez kept San Luis Obispo 
hitters off balance and did not allow a hit until the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"The curveball was working again," said Martinez, who lowered his earned-run 
average to 2.33. "If you get your curveball over for strikes when you're behind 
then you're going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge increased its lead to 5-0 in the fifth inning when Clayton, who had 
three hits and four runs batted in, hit a shot off San Luis Obispo third 
baseman Matt Drake that scored Mike Solar and Weisfuss, who had walked and 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo scored two runs in the sixth on a bases-loaded double by Sean 
Harper that followed a single by Bill Daly, an error by Northridge second 
baseman Randy Thompson and a single by Robert Hale. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge answered with five runs in the home half of the inning to increase 
its lead to 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Haendiges led off with a single and scored on a double by Denny Vigo. Two outs 
later, Weisfuss singled for his third hit of the game and then scored on 
Clayton's fourth home run of the season, a low drive just inside the left-field 
foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Mossman replaced Chura (5-4) after Clayton's home run and Chong greeted 
him with a fly ball over the scoreboard in right field for his seventh homer of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez surrendered a solo home run to Ron Crowe in the ninth before slamming 
the door.

possession of second place and dropped Bakersfield (5-2 in the WSC) into third. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffner did not walk a batter and twice worked out of bases-loaded jams.

TAFT'S THOMAS ACHIEVES PASSING SCORE ON SAT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Dedan Thomas, an All-City Section point guard at Taft High, learned Friday that 
he had scored more than 700 on his Scholastic Aptitude Test as mandated by NCAA 
freshman entrance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who before his senior season signed a letter of intent to attend Nevada 
Las Vegas, scored less than 700 on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In order to be eligible next season under the NCAA's Prop. 48, Thomas also will 
have to post a 2.0 grade-point average and meet core curriculum requirements.

VICKERS FACES A GRUELING TASK IN NORTHRIDGE INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a high school senior in 1987, Janeene Vickers single-handedly led Pomona to 
the girls' team title in the state track and field championships at Hughes 
Stadium in Sacramento, winning the 100 meters, the 100-meter low hurdles and 
the 300-meter low hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Her three victories totaled 30 points, two better than runner-up Long Beach 
Poly. 
</P>
<P>
However, the UCLA sophomore's propensity for excelling in numerous events might 
push her endurance to the limit in the Northridge Invitational at Cal State 
Northridge today. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers has entered six events -- the 100, 200, 400, 400-meter low hurdles, 
400- and 1,600-meter relays -- in the two-day meet, which begins this morning 
at 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm wouldn't be surprised if she runs all those events," Northridge Coach Don 
Strametz said. "She's been doing that in recent weeks. A lot will probably 
depend on the weather." 
</P>
<P>
While Vickers may be the most noteworthy entrant, there will be plenty of local 
talent on display, including Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge and former 
CSUN standout Vaughan Kastor. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the defending NCAA Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000, will 
run in the 800 and 1,500 during the women's meet today while Kastor has entered 
the same events in the men's meet Sunday. Kastor, who set the Northridge school 
record of 1 minute, 49.21 seconds in the 800 meters last year, will compete for 
Running Experience Track Club.

BURNHAM-MILLER DUEL SET FOR ARCADIA SPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in three years, Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High will be the 
underdog in the Arcadia Invitational track meet tonight at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200 meters, will be pitted 
against Muir's Inger Miller in both sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was second in the 100 and third in the 200 at last year's state 
championships at Cerritos College and defeated Burnham in the 100 (11.70 
seconds to 11.74) at the Alemany-Northridge Relays at Cal State Northridge 
three weeks ago. Miller also ran a national-best 23.62 in the 200 in the 
Pasadena Games at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, Track and Field News' female athlete of the year in 1988, defeated 
Miller twice at Arcadia last year, and is the two-time defending Arcadia 
champion in the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
The meet starts at 4 p.m. with the boys' discus, followed by the boys' long 
jump and the girls' high jump, triple jump and discus at 5:30. The first 
running event is the boys' seeded 400-meter relay at 6:40. 
</P>
<P>
Russell White of Crespi will compete in four events. White is the defending 
Arcadia champion in the triple jump and bounded 48 feet, 4 inches Thursday in a 
dual meet against St. John Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
However, he will be a decided underdog in the long jump -- despite his 23-4 
best -- to Dion Bentley of Penn Hills (Pa.), who set a national high school 
indoor record of 26-6 1/2 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
White, who was eighth in the 200 in the state meet last season, also will run 
in the seeded 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Borquez of Alemany, eighth in the 400 at the state meet, and Jeff Ingalls 
of Agoura have run 48.65 and 48.66, respectively, in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank's Todd Lewis, who was the runner-up in the 1,600 at the Southern 
Section 3-A Division championships last year, will be tested in the boys' 1,600 
by Coley Candaele of Carpinteria and Francis O'Neill of San Pasqual St. 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' 3,200 will match several of the state's best cross-country runners, 
including Bryan Dameworth of Agoura (state Division I champion). Also entered 
in the race are Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks (second), Dave Hartman of 
Canyon (seventh), and Craig Lawson of Granada Hills (10th). 
</P>
<P>
Williamson also will run in the 1,600 with Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley, 
who is the defending 4-A champion in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Crissy Mills of Campbell Hall and Nikki Smith of Montclair 
Prep will compete in the girls' high jump and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
Mills is the defending state champion in the high jump and Smith placed second 
in the long jump at last year's state meet.

COUNTY'S BEST HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYERS ON DISPLAY TONIGHT

<P>
The top boys' and girls' senior basketball players in San Diego County will 
make their final local appearances in high school games tonight at Serra High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
County girls will play a team of city players at 5:30, and Division 2-A boys' 
all-stars will play a 3-A team at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
The games, which traditionally have been played in June, have been moved closer 
to the end of the basketball season to generate more interest. Admission is $4 
for adults, $3 for students. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-A boys defeated the 3-A team, 116-101, last year. It was the first 2-A 
victory since the format was changed from city playing county in 1986. The 
county girls easily defeated the city, 72-56. 
</P>
<P>
This season's boys' game features a couple of interesting matchups. Torrey 
Pines forward Courtie Miller, two-time San Diego Section player of the year, 
and teammate Kevin Flanagan (a center) will play for the 3-A team, and swingman 
Joe Temple and center Aaron Wilhite of Lincoln are expected to play for 2-A. 
Torrey Pines was ranked No. 1 in the county and Lincoln No. 2, but the teams 
never met during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Also eligible are All-County players Robby Robinson of Madison and Will Tate of 
Southwest for the 3-A team and Ray McDavid of Clairemont for the 2-A. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pederson of Kearny and Dennis Kane of San Diego will coach the 2-A boys, 
and David Ybarra of Sweetwater and John Farrell of Torrey Pines will coach 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
The county girls include four All-County players, led by center Chris Enger of 
Vista. Others include Dana Christofferson of Vista, San Marcos guard Susie 
O'Brien (the county's leading scorer with a 29.9-point average) and Mesega 
Johnson, a forward from Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The city team will be led by Point Loma guard Monica Filer, section player of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The county girls are coached by Vista's Joe DeMaria and Bob Kellison of San 
Marcos, the city by Lori Schwalbach of La Jolla and Mira Mesa's Gary Blevins.

No, you'd never call this one easy -- at least, not as easy as the 4-0 score 
would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sockers whittled their magic number for clinching a Major Indoor Soccer 
League playoff berth to one and for clinching second to two by that margin 
Friday night before a noisy Tacoma Dome crowd of 6,716. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers can accomplish both tonight by winning at Wichita, if Dallas loses 
in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt if we could win tonight -- and we had every right to win -- we would be 
in a good position," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "Everything pointed that we 
had to win unless we did something (badly) drastic." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-rock defense gets the credit for this one, beginning with goalkeeper 
Victor Nogueira, who notched his second shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Noguiera almost could have paid to get in: He made only four saves, 
but three of the were tough. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't single out anyone," Noguiera said. But then he added, "George 
Fernandez was unbelievable. He was just diving all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that he's finished his real estate course, he's thinking about soccer 
again. He's unbelievable again. Everybody else was, too. 
</P>
<P>
"A shutout doesn't take one person. At the beginning of the game, I didn't feel 
that great. My legs were heavy. But the defense was great." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, with his first game-winning goal and a picture-perfect assist, was 
in the middle of it at both ends: He also had six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We played awesome defense," Fernandez said. "Everybody got back. As a team we 
played very well. Our defenders stuck it to them." 
</P>
<P>
The Stars stretched their scoreless minutes to 91:50 and, as Newman said, "They 
missed a lot of opportunities they usually put away." 
</P>
<P>
In an intense first half, characterized by the teams barking at each other and 
three penalties on the Sockers, San Diego finally got on the board at 10:38 
with what turned out to be the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who has never made a living at the far post, volleyed in a Steve 
Zungul corner kick from left wing that was nicely threaded through traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty shocked the ball got through," Fernandez said. "There wasn't that 
much space. He just put it on my foot." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers stretched their lead to 2-0 at 2:23 of the third quarter. Branko 
Segota arched a free kick from the top of the circle to Kevin Crow, who headed 
it through Tacoma keeper Mike Dowler's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers made it 3-0 at 13:46 of the third on a nice collaboration between 
Fernandez and Cacho. Fernandez chipped a lob pass to Cacho on the run behind 
the Stars defense, and the Cacho volleyed it inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' fourth goal, by Waad Hirmez from Segota, came at 10:32 with Tacoma 
trying the sixth attacker. 
</P>
<P>
On one, Socker Zoran Karic banged a shot off the crossbar that rocketed down 
right on the line. On the the other, Tacoma's Preki did the same, surprising 
Nogueira with a right-footed shot.

JOSHUA BELL WITH THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An orchestral program of Mozart, Richard Strauss and Brahms sounds about as 
predictable and familiar as possible. From these composers, however, Andre 
Previn drew a curious and audacious agenda for the Los Angeles Philharmonic on 
Thursday evening at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with a small contingent of strings and timpani, huddled 
together in the middle of an otherwise empty stage. Their employment? The 
"Serenata Notturna" by Mozart, K. 239, a witty, effervescent contemporary of 
the much better-known "Haffner" Serenade. 
</P>
<P>
A comic concerto grosso, the serenade offered gracious, grateful solo work to 
violinists Sidney Weiss and Harold Dicterow, violist Dale Hikawa and bassist 
Christopher Hanulik, with the buffo timpani punctuation provided by Mitchell 
Peters. Previn kept matters well-balanced and moving, though intonation 
suffered surprising lapses. 
</P>
<P>
The stage was not much more fully occupied for Strauss' "Metamorphosen." In 
style a sort of heroically swollen chamber music of the gods, in spirit an 
autumnal elegy, it received a suitably moody reading from Previn and 23 
strings, clean and taut but also sounding muted and remote in the Pavilion 
expanses. 
</P>
<P>
These chamber orchestra offerings were matched with Brahms' Violin Concerto. 
Contrast was clearly intended and inevitable, but soloist Joshua Bell also saw 
to it that there was a real measure of integration. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there was anything small-scale about his interpretation, although his 
sweet, slender tone was occasionally overwhelmed in the big climaxes. Indeed, 
his account was warmly expansive, restrained in tempos and generous in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
But it was expressed with the conversational directness of chamber music. 
Excepting some quirky accentuation, as in the beginning of the finale, it was 
without rhetorical exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Bell plays with a natural grace and simplicity, despite body language that 
suggests a man trying to jump out of shoes glued to the floor. He seized the 
bravura work with concentrated zest, but left the deepest impression through 
winning, ardent lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
His substantial cadenza had much of Kreisler in it, as well as a fearlessly 
piquant development of Brahms' Hungarianisms. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic backed Bell with a solid, cohesive effort, sonically ripe and 
focused. Previn maintained close contact with his soloist, reining in his 
orchestra's intermittent attempts to forge ahead. JOHN HENKEN

A MINI-MARATHON OF VOCAL COMPOSITIONS AT HOIBY FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A generous sampling of vocal music by Lee Hoiby made a long evening at the last 
program of the Hoiby Festival at Cal State Long Beach on Thursday night. The 
actual closing of this nine-day celebration takes place at the final 
performance of "Summer and Smoke" by the university's Lyric Theatre/Opera at 
2:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 12 singers -- faculty, guests and graduate and undergraduate 
students -- participated in this mini-marathon, which offered 21 songs and 
three large chunks of Hoiby's 1986 opera, "The Tempest." The singing was 
variable, but the high quality of the music was not. 
</P>
<P>
Not to waffle: Hoiby writes wondrous, not just funny, songs -- songs as 
touching, communicative, poignant, vocally effective and pungent as any written 
in this century. 
</P>
<P>
For those unfamiliar with the whole range of his output, this small survey was 
revelatory. 
</P>
<P>
It showed the composer in different modes of poetic inspiration, from the 
declamatory (to Whitman's text, "I Was There") to the sentimental (the 
Brahmsian "Where the Music Comes From," to the composer's own poem) to the 
heroic (Emily Dickinson's "There Came a Wind Like a Bugle") to the horrific 
(the same poet's "How the Waters Closed") to the abstract (Wallace Stevens' 
"Evening"). 
</P>
<P>
There was even Hoiby's most familiar song, "The Serpent" -- with which Leontyne 
Price has been titillating audiences for years -- as sung most engagingly by 
soprano Shigemi Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
The major discovery, however, came in the excerpts from "The Tempest," with 
Shakespearean libretto by Hoiby's associate, Mark Shulgasser. These showed the 
composer's thorough mastery of literary and musical language in the service of 
dramatic point. 
</P>
<P>
Hoiby himself, resourceful and virtuosic pianist that he is, played the 
orchestral part on a grand piano; one can imagine the full effect of the 
complete instrumental complement, especially in the great finale of the opera. 
</P>
<P>
Here, assisted nicely by the acoustics in Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall, 
singers David Downing (Prospero), Rose Chu (Miranda), Dwight Coots (Ferdinand) 
and Christina Tardif (Ariel), in particular, brought the last scene to life. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other artists, mezzo-soprano Stephanie Vlahos' intense and nuanced 
singing of the Four Dickinson Songs (1987) and artistic director Michael 
Carson's evening-long, solid and effortless pianistic support, must be noted.

ARMS URANIUM OUTPUT ENDING, GORBACHEV SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended a whirlwind visit to Britain on 
Friday with one of his familiar unilateral disarmament gestures and a fresh 
warning to Western politicians that it is time for them to respond more 
positively to his "new thinking." 
</P>
<P>
The gesture -- a halt in production of nuclear weapons-grade uranium and the 
closing by 1991 of two reactors used to make weapons-grade plutonium -- was 
quickly dismissed by independent experts and the Bush Administration as 
relatively meaningless in military terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Strain Alliance 
</P>
<P>
But his warning that a North Atlantic Treaty Organization plan to modernize its 
short-range nuclear arsenal could force the Soviet Union to follow suit and 
jeopardize conventional arms reduction negotiations in central Europe is 
considered likely to put further strain on a Western alliance already at odds 
over the modernization issue. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's moves came amid a dazzling display of traditional British pomp and 
circumstance that culminated with lunch at Windsor Palace, where Queen 
Elizabeth II accepted the Soviet leader's invitation to visit Moscow at an 
undetermined future date. 
</P>
<P>
The monarch's acceptance, which required the approval of Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's government, underlined the extraordinary warmth that has 
come to coexist with continued, sharp policy differences in the complex 
Soviet-British relationship. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Moscow by the Queen, the first since her distant relatives of the 
Russian royal family were overthrown in the 1917 Russian Revolution, would 
represent a highly symbolic endorsement by Britain of the changes that 
Gorbachev has wrought in the Soviet system. At the same time, Thatcher's 
government hopes that the prospect of the visit will become another incentive 
for the transformation to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Gorbachev assured several hundred invited dignitaries at 
Guildhall, the ornate and historic seat of the City of London's government, 
that "there is no turning back" from his program of reform, known in Russian as 
perestroika. And he hailed Britain as "the nation whose political experience 
has enriched the history of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher responded by praising the Soviet leader as "one of those rare people 
who has the vision, the boldness and the sheer power of personality to change 
the whole future of his country, and to have a profound effect on the wider 
world as well." 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent television interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., she 
added: "I do think he's a man of destiny." 
</P>
<P>
For all the superlatives, however, Gorbachev's Guildhall speech was a 
disappointment to those who had expected him to announce some major new arms 
control initiative or to expound his vision of a future "common European home" 
for the peoples of East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he stressed what he described as the bankruptcy of the Cold War 
"philosophy of confrontation" and called for a new era of "international 
interaction" that will be necessary to solve the "various dangerous and 
pressing problems facing mankind." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the Soviet commitment to reduce weapons arsenals, Gorbachev said, "I 
take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently decided to cease this 
year the production of enriched weapon-grade uranium." 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the industrial reactor for the production of weapon-grade 
plutonium shut down in 1987," he added, "we plan to shut down two other such 
reactors this year and next year without commissioning new units to replace 
them. This is yet another major step towards the complete cessation of 
production of fissionable materials for use in weapons." 
</P>
<P>
However, independent experts said the Soviets already have a sufficient 
stockpile of nuclear materials. Also, materials contained in the warheads of 
the medium-range missiles being dismantled under Intermediate-range Nuclear 
Forces reduction agreements with the West can be reused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that anybody at this point believes that this will have any 
effect on their ability to produce nuclear weapons," commented Hans Bennendyk, 
an arms control expert at London's International Institute for Strategic 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher told reporters here that the Soviet move "is unlikely to have an 
effect for some years," and in Washington, State Department spokesman Richard 
Boucher dismissed the announcement, saying at a news briefing that "the 
measures will leave the Soviet Union with substantial production capabilities 
for nuclear materials." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, asked at a press conference about Gorbachev's announcement, 
replied that he hadn't seen it. But he rejected Gorbachev's criticism of the 
day before that the United States is foot-dragging rather than moving forward 
with the Soviet Union on arms control and that the Bush Administration is 
taking too long with its review of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me simply say we're the United States of America," the President said. 
"We're making a prudent review, and I will be ready to discuss that with the 
Soviets when we are ready. Mr. Gorbachev knows that there is no foot-dragging 
going on . . . ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing his warning on tactical nuclear weapons, Gorbachev said, "There can 
be no doubt that if NATO goes ahead with its (modernization) program, . . . 
this is bound to affect the Vienna (conventional arms) talks, 
confidence-building measures, and the situation in Europe in general. This is 
bound to devalue much of what has been achieved under the INF 
(Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons," he 
added. "We are not modernizing, nor do we intend to modernize them unless we 
are made to." 
</P>
<P>
One British analyst termed Gorbachev's statement "a shot across the bow" of 
NATO at a time that both the United States and Britain are pressing the allies 
to commit to modernization. They argue that the Soviets have already brought 
their tactical nuclear arsenal up to date, leaving NATO far behind. West 
Germany, however, wants to postpone the decision, and the debate is expected to 
come to a head within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the modernization issue is a fundamental difference between Thatcher 
and Gorbachev over the future of nuclear weapons. Gorbachev has stated that his 
goal is to have a world without such weapons by the year 2000. Thatcher argues 
that it will be impossible to put the nuclear "genie" back in the bottle, and 
that furthermore, nuclear weapons have been an effective deterrent to war in 
Europe for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Soviet leader appeared slightly uncomfortable during most of a day 
in which he was surrounded by a British pageantry little changed through many 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, were greeted at the entrance to Guildhall by 
Christopher Collet, the Lord Mayor of The City, the square-mile area that is 
the oldest part of the capital and now mostly its financial district. Collet, 
who was robed in blue, gold, and ermine and wore a plumed, tricorn hat, walked 
beside the Soviet leader, who wore a dark pinstripe business suit, into the 
splendid main chamber. They marched behind more robed men carrying the huge, 
ceremonial golden mace and sword as the state trumpeters sounded their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
As he reached his chair next to the podium, Gorbachev began to sit just as the 
first notes of the British national anthem were played. He recovered quickly. 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared uncertain on arrival at Windsor Castle, nervously 
straightening his coat as he stepped out of his armor-plated Zil limousine to 
shake hands with the waiting Queen. He was again out of place for the start of 
the national anthem before Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, guided him back 
to the proper spot. 
</P>
<P>
Invited to review a battalion of bearskin-capped Coldstream Guards on the 
castle's immaculately manicured internal quadrangle, Gorbachev scurried past 
the ranks without even looking at the troops in their gray greatcoats on either 
side. 
</P>
<P>
He did take an interest during a brief royal tour of the castle in portraits of 
Czar Alexander I and half a dozen other Russian military heroes who helped 
defeat Napoleon in 1812. He also stopped to admire a huge suit of armor said to 
have been made for King Henry VIII. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev seemed his happiest when, for the second time in his brief visit, 
he ordered his limousine stopped in downtown London so he could get out and mix 
with the crowds of British well-wishers.

LEBANON'S CHRISTIAN-LED REGIME HAS BACK TO WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanon's civil strife, entering its 15th year next week, has evolved from a 
standoff between rival Christian and Muslim militias to a struggle for survival 
by the Christian-led government against not only Lebanese Muslims but also 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The latest phase of the war has already killed at least 177 and injured almost 
600 since early March, according to Lebanese police. 
</P>
<P>
When the war erupted on April 13, 1975, the main issue was the uneven division 
of power among the country's 17 recognized religious sects. Now, it has become 
a regional conflict that pits the Lebanese army against Syria and, potentially, 
also the occupying armies of Israel, Iran and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"This stage of the fighting is different from the past 14 years," said Maj. 
Gen. Michel Aoun, interviewed in Beirut by telephone. "For the first time, we 
are saying that we want the liberation of the country from all foreign forces. 
We want no one left so we can reconcile the country and rebuild Lebanon -- 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, the Christian commander of the Lebanese army, has also been Lebanon's 
acting chief of state since the Parliament was unable to elect a new president 
last September. He has used Lebanon's military to enforce his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim factions, which refused to accept Aoun's appointment by outgoing 
President Amin Gemayel, formed their own government under Premier Salim Hoss. 
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis began in early March when Aoun moved to exert government 
authority over both Christian and Muslim militias. His first step was to close 
the various militia-run illegal ports that have diverted at least $100 million 
of vital state revenues to the sectarian factions. 
</P>
<P>
His goal, as he told his nation in a televised address Thursday, is to regain 
state sovereignty and to "meet around a Lebanese negotiating table for a free 
and true national dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun specifically mentioned long-sought reforms that would give Muslims a 
greater share of power in the Christian-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
The general launched the campaign to regain state control March 8 with a 
crackdown on ports run by Christian militias. He followed up on March 14 with a 
blockade around Muslim-run ports. 
</P>
<P>
But those actions led Syria and its Druze and Muslim allies to respond 
militarily, opening fire on the Aoun government in Christian-dominated East 
Beirut and laying siege around the 310-square-mile Christian enclave stretching 
from Batroun in the mountainous north to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Beirut has witnessed some of the most savage fighting of the entire 
war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Christians Taking the Brunt 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous stages of the conflict, the Christians are now feeling the 
brunt of the artillery barrages. They are also facing the shortages -- of fuel, 
water and electricity -- that Muslim sectors have suffered in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"They are destroying the infrastructure of the country, everything but the 
military positions," Aoun charged of the Syrians. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador's residence has been hit once, causing a brief fire, and 
shells landing nearby have caused further damage. The French consul-general's 
home came under a four-hour bombardment this week after a French envoy arrived 
to try to mediate. The envoy said he interpreted the strike as an "unambiguous" 
welcome from Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"Aoun is portraying it as a 'last stand,' the Lebanese equivalent of 'Give us 
liberty or give us death,' " said a Bush Administration official. "He truly 
sees himself as the liberator of Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
But in one of the odd twists to the war's new stage, many Muslim civilians, 
exhausted by a generation of warfare and angered by the domineering Syrian 
presence since 1976, are reportedly quietly backing Aoun. U.S. analysts say 
that Aoun has won more Muslim backing for the Christian-led government than at 
any point since the civil war began. 
</P>
<P>
Total support for the Syrians has been limited to the Druze militia, a 
pro-Syrian party and radical Palestinian factions. Other Muslim factions -- 
including the two largest Shiite militias, Amal and Hezbollah (Party of God) -- 
have verbally supported Syria but have not become major players in the clashes, 
according to Lebanese and U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
For the Syrian regime of President Hafez Assad, the stakes are also high, 
according to American analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Damascus has always had a proprietary interest in Lebanon, which was carved out 
of Syria by the French to provide protection for the last Christian stronghold 
in the Middle East. Syria has always felt that Lebanon's identity should be 
with the Arab world, while Christians viewed the Mediterranean state as the 
eastern outpost of the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians have long feared that Lebanon would become too oriented to the 
West. Their short-term concern is that Muslims gain a greater share of power in 
the Arab world's only democracy. They became directly involved in 1976, when 
they sent in troops ostensibly to help guarantee peace between Christian and 
Muslim factions that had been fighting since the summer of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
According to Augustus Richard Norton, professor of politics at the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point, the current situation in Lebanon is ultimately 
driven by Syria's feeling of being "incredibly boxed in" because of several 
political and military setbacks, 
</P>
<P>
PLO chief Yasser Arafat, Assad's rival for control of the Arab position in the 
Arab-Israeli dispute, opened a dialogue with the United States last December. 
He also made peace with Aoun in January after almost seven years of tension 
between the PLO and the Lebanese government. Politically, Syria appears 
increasingly isolated on both fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Iran, Syria's ally in their joint rivalry with Iraq, abruptly ended the Persian 
Gulf War last summer. Baghdad then moved in to supply Lebanon's Christian 
militias with arms, which again challenged Syrian hegemony in Lebanon. 
Militarily, Damascus is now more vulnerable on two of its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, however, has the military edge in Lebanon. It has up to 40,000 troops 
spread throughout two-thirds of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Aoun Hold Out? 
</P>
<P>
And Aoun's ability to hold out through a prolonged siege is doubtful, U.S. 
officials say. In the interview, Aoun claimed to have 15,000 army troops under 
his command, although Bush Administration sources put the figure at only about 
8,000. 
</P>
<P>
A precarious cease-fire mediated by the Arab League appeared to take hold 
Friday. But few in Lebanon or the United States expect it to last, since Aoun 
refuses to end his blockade of the Muslim ports, and Syria has balked at 
lifting the siege. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese on both sides of the Green Line that divides the capital reportedly 
spent the day buying and filling new sandbags to fortify their homes and 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
The siege of the Christian enclave has created a furor in France, from which 
Lebanon gained independence in 1943. Paris has dispatched two vessels carrying 
fuel and basic foods to Beirut. France is also expected to introduce a 
resolution at the United Nations calling for an end to the siege. 
</P>
<P>
To show solidarity with the Christians, dozens of French nationals have applied 
for honorary Lebanese citizenship at the Lebanese Embassy in Paris.

SOVIET SUBMARINE SINKS OFF NORWAY; 
</P>
<P>
NUCLEAR-DRIVEN CRAFT GOES DOWN AFTER FIRE; 'MAJOR LOSS OF LIFE' REPORTED

<P>
An advanced Soviet attack submarine caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea 
on Friday, U.S. and Norwegian government sources reported. A Soviet official in 
Oslo confirmed that it had sunk. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear-powered Mike-class submarine, which can carry a crew of 95, 
suffered a catastrophic accident involving "major loss of life," one U.S. 
government official said. An American monitoring reports on the incident said 
the vessel surfaced briefly, then sank. 
</P>
<P>
At the Soviet Embassy in Oslo, a spokesman early today said the submarine sank 
but gave no other information, Reuters news agency reported, quoting the 
Norwegian news agency NTB. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they did not know what weapons the craft was carrying, but 
that it is capable of launching SS-N-21 cruise missiles with either nuclear or 
conventional warheads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed One of a Kind 
</P>
<P>
The accident involving the submarine, believed to be the only one of its kind, 
may provide an intelligence bonanza for the United States and its allies if 
reconnaissance ships, aircraft or satellites were able to take detailed, 
close-up photographs of the rare craft as it surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Defense Ministry said that Soviet ships and aircraft were in the 
area where the sub was lost, in international waters off Spitsbergen Island 
near the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Norwegian military aircraft had flown over the area, about 
300 miles from North Cape on the Norwegian mainland, and had seen the submarine 
ablaze. Officials said the fire appeared to be concentrated in the stern, or 
rear, of the vessel, where water distillation equipment and propulsion 
machinery are housed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have observed bodies," Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told 
NTB. "We do not yet have an exact figure." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on Britain's Independent Television News, Norwegian 
Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Gullow Gjeseth said that in a flight over the 
submarine, "I saw at the time two dinghies, with the personnel in one dinghy. 
We saw also a Soviet merchant ship in the area and we know also Soviet aircraft 
have been over the area." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have built only one submarine of this type, according to "Jane's 
Fighting Ships," the authoritative British reference book on the world's 
navies. U.S. naval intelligence analysts said it was built as a platform for 
experiments in submarine design, and may have special coatings and a unique 
propulsion system. The sub's design reduces both the turbulence and noise that 
the boat creates when it is moving, making it harder to locate in the 
cat-and-mouse game that U.S. and Soviet submarines play undersea. 
</P>
<P>
The 361-foot-long vessel was launched at Severodvinsk in May, 1983. It was 
powered by twin, liquid-metal-cooled nuclear reactors and had an estimated top 
speed of 38 knots. 
</P>
<P>
The double-hulled ship was probably made of titanium for weight and noise 
reduction, according to Jane's. Norman Polmar, an independent American naval 
analyst, said the submarine could have been carrying as many as six 
nuclear-tipped torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Information Available 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had little 
information on the incident Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we have no details. 
We understand there has been a loss of life but we can't confirm how many," 
Fitzwater said. "We express the sympathy of the United States government to the 
Soviet government for any loss of life involved." President Bush had been 
notified of the accident, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the sinking in the Norwegian Sea is the site of many naval 
exercises by both Eastern and Western forces and is considered a potential 
battleground in the event of a large-scale conflict. Western forces practice 
keeping Soviet submarines away from Atlantic shipping lanes, while Soviet 
vessels patrol there to keep track of Western ships. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said that before sinking, the submarine could have released its 
ballast, causing the ship to pop up high on the surface of the ocean, exposing 
some of the sub's underside. 
</P>
<P>
"This really could be an intelligence coup," said one American naval analyst. 
When a disabled Soviet Victor-class submarine surfaced off Newport, R.I., in 
the mid-1980s, analysts reaped a harvest of valuable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But the accident poses potentially severe environmental hazards as well. 
Previous submarine accidents have resulted in release of radiation, and in 1961 
members of a Soviet submarine crew died of radiation poisoning after an 
accident in the Baltic, according to recently declassified CIA documents. 
</P>
<P>
John Holdren, professor of energy and resources at UC Berkeley and an expert on 
nuclear issues who has served as an adviser to the Department of Energy, said 
that if radiation leaked from the vessel's reactors from the sea bottom, not 
much would reach the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean and the chemicals naturally occurring in it have a diluting effect on 
radiation, he said. The submarine would probably come to rest so far down that 
little radiation is likely to reach the surface or contaminate edible fish, 
which generally inhabit waters less deep. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . One could imagine an effect on fisheries," Holdren said, "but in 
previous nuclear submarine accidents there has not been enough damage to the 
reactor to produce a big effect." 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident is the fifth known sinking of a Soviet nuclear-powered 
submarine. A Soviet Yankee-class ballistic missile sub sank 600 miles east of 
Bermuda in 1986. A Charlie-class cruise-missile submarines went down off 
Kamchatka Peninsula in 1983. And in 1970, a November-class torpedo-attack 
submarine sank off the Atlantic coast of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the best-known incident, the forward section of a Soviet Golf-class 
submarine that had sunk northwest of Hawaii in 1968 was recovered from the 
seabed in 1974 by the American salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. nuclear submarines have been lost at sea -- the Thresher off the U.S. 
East Coast in 1963 with the loss of 129 lives, and the Scorpion off the Azores 
Islands in 1968, with 99 men killed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, then-Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. told reporters, "We do have 
firm evidence that their (Soviet) standards of safety -- and crew safety -- are 
far lower than ours in nuclear power plants." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Maura Dolan, in Los Angeles, contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MIKE SUBMARINE: ONE OF A KIND

NORTH LIED TO CONGRESSMEN, DEFENDS ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Oliver L. North acknowledged Friday that he helped compose "factually 
incorrect" letters to congressmen and later made untruthful statements to them 
in a face-to-face White House meeting -- the main offenses on which he is being 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
But North, in his second day on the witness stand, defended his conduct by 
contending that members of Congress had no right to know about his secret 
activities in support of the Nicaraguan Contras, saying that they were covert 
actions "I knew it wasn't right to tell the truth about." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., the retired Marine 
lieutenant colonel said that he had reluctantly drafted misleading responses to 
congressmen for his boss, National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed Any Response 
</P>
<P>
North said he had opposed providing any information to Congress and had urged 
McFarlane to invoke President Ronald Reagan's prerogative of "executive 
privilege." 
</P>
<P>
However, McFarlane decided that a flat refusal to provide information "would be 
too confrontational," North said. 
</P>
<P>
He gave North a letter from Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), who was chairman of 
the House Intelligence Committee, and told North: "Give me a stab at answering 
it," the ex-Marine testified. 
</P>
<P>
"So I did a draft response," North said, adding that McFarlane sent Hamilton a 
letter based on two paragraphs of North's draft. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton and another congressional witness, former Rep. Michael D. Barnes 
(D-Md.), testified earlier at the trial that in September, 1985, they had 
received letters from McFarlane insisting that North was complying with "both 
the letter and the spirit" of congressional curbs on military aid for the 
Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The letters specifically denied press reports that the National Security 
Council staff officer was helping to raise private money for the Contras or was 
giving them tactical military advice, two activities that more than a dozen 
witnesses have said North conducted. 
</P>
<P>
North testified that McFarlane used the same draft response to reply separately 
to Barnes, who then was chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. He 
said he never wanted McFarlane to send either letter "because the answer he 
wanted to give them was wrong, not accurate and factually incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane had to know that his draft answer contained lies, North said, because 
"the answer basically denied the things that he (McFarlane) had had me do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told to See Lawmakers 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986 -- a year after McFarlane had sent the letters and eight months 
after McFarlane had left government service -- North said, his new boss, Vice 
Adm. John M. Poindexter, told him to meet with a congressional delegation that 
wanted to question North directly about his activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was a good idea," North said. "But Poindexter told me: 'You 
can handle it.' I believe I raised with him that there were things that I was 
doing . . . that should not be revealed. He said: 'You can take care of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
North testified that he was under orders from his superiors not to tell 
Congress or anyone else about the Reagan Administration's solicitation of aid 
from other countries to help the Contras. He said he could not divulge his 
efforts to resupply the guerrilla forces for fear of jeopardizing the lives or 
reputations of many others who were helping him, including a number of foreign 
government officials in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wasn't Right to Tell Truth' 
</P>
<P>
"Did you tell the truth at that meeting on Aug. 6, 1986?" Sullivan asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," North replied. "I knew it wasn't right to tell the truth about those 
(confidential) things." 
</P>
<P>
In a choked voice, he added: 
</P>
<P>
"I had been raised to know what the Ten Commandments are all about, and I never 
believed what I did was unlawful." 
</P>
<P>
North, who is also accused of having altered or shredded many White House 
documents just before the Iran-Contra scandal was disclosed in November, 1986, 
blamed his actions on orders issued by McFarlane before he left office. 
</P>
<P>
"McFarlane gave me a list," North said. "He said: 'Fix these documents so they 
will be consistent with what we told the Congress.' They were his documents. I 
had written them, but they were memos to him, and therefore his documents." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane last year pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of misleading 
Congress and has been sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of 
community service and fined $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
In testifying last month at North's trial, McFarlane gave a different account 
of the events. He said he thought North was keeping in touch with the Contras 
on an informational basis to try to keep up their morale until Congress 
restored full funding for them. McFarlane said he was unaware of the extent of 
North's activities in supporting the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan led North through a long recitation of repeated trips he had made to 
Geneva, Cyprus and Beirut in the weeks before he was fired to try to obtain the 
release of American hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Hopes for Hostages 
</P>
<P>
North said that, on the eve of his dismissal, William J. Casey, the late CIA 
director, felt that the Administration had opened up a promising "second 
channel" to Iranian moderates that might prove successful in getting hostages 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan had North show jurors a handwritten commendation from President Bush, 
then the vice president, that North had received a year before his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's note, dated Nov. 27, 1985, praised North for his performance of duty 
"under fire in tough situations," adding: "Your dedication to the hostage thing 
and Central America gives me cause for great pride."

A 26-year-old stabbing victim whose life-support system was disconnected eight 
days ago over the objections of his assailant died Friday, nearly four years 
after the attack left him in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Lane said her son, Mark Weaver, died at about 2 a.m. "He died 
peacefully. He never had a moment's pain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison for stabbing Weaver during a 
street fight in 1985, fought unsuccessfully in court last week to force 
Weaver's family to keep him alive on a feeding tube. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Pagan, who is now on probation, could face a murder charge 
once Weaver died, but they need a cause of death before they can decide whether 
to seek charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical examiner will conduct an autopsy and make a report to us, and then 
we will make a decision," state Atty. Gen. James E. Tierney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tierney declined to say what sort of finding would be necessary before a murder 
charge could be sought.

TOKYO EMBASSY GETS 500 INQUIRIES ABOUT INTERNEE PAYMENTS

In the first six weeks of a special U.S. redress program, about 500 callers 
have contacted the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo about payments authorized for 
Japanese-Americans interned in the United States during World War II, a Justice 
Department official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Between 3,000 and 5,000 internees returned to Japan after the war, Robert K. 
Bratt, who heads the redress administration office, estimated. He said there 
are 1,500 to 2,500 potential recipients living there. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone response was announced a day after a House Appropriations 
subcommittee took the first step toward providing funds for restitution -- 
approving $250 million for fiscal 1990. The Administration has sought no funds 
for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 offered redress for the forcible evacuation and 
internment of 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry by the U.S. government. An 
estimated 60,000 surviving former internees are eligible to receive payments of 
$20,000 apiece for their loss of civil liberties.

U.S. AND JAPAN REACH TENTATIVE FSX ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Bush Administration and the Japanese government have agreed in principle on 
a compromise in their dispute over the proposed joint development of an 
advanced FSX fighter plane and hope to have details ironed out early next week, 
U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The terms, which strategists say have been approved generally by President Bush 
and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, include agreement for U.S. firms 
to garner "about 40%" of the production work involved in the plane, rather than 
merely sharing in the development phase. 
</P>
<P>
The accord also calls for the United States to have access, free of charge, to 
any new technology that Japan develops under the project as a result of U.S. 
technology. Washington would also be able to buy any new technology that Japan 
develops from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
The deal on the fighter jet, which is to be patterned after the American F-16, 
is unusual because it not only reflects traditional U.S. concerns about sharing 
of sensitive American military technology, but also this country's interest in 
making certain that Americans have access to any new technology developed by 
its partner. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Japan has not developed any major military aircraft on its own 
since World War II, American officials recognize that Japanese technological 
capability is so sophisticated that it could easily develop breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the White House hopes to work out enough details this 
weekend to make possible a formal exchange of letters confirming the terms 
early next week, in time to present the deal to Congress before House hearings 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress agrees with the changes, it could mean an end to internal wrangling 
that has surrounded the FSX issue and head off any souring of U.S.-Japanese 
relations over the agreement, an eventuality some analysts feared could spread 
to political issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modest Victory 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials described the compromise as a modest but important victory for 
the Administration in its effort to tighten the guarantees in the original 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Reagan Administration had closed the FSX deal with Japan last 
November after 18 months of negotiations between the Defense and State 
departments and their counterpart ministries in Japan. Both sides declared the 
resulting agreement fair. 
</P>
<P>
However, almost immediately after the details were disclosed, Bush 
Administration economic officials raised objections, arguing that it would 
"give away" U.S. technology and hand Japan the wherewithal to start a civilian 
aircraft industry. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also entered the picture, with lawmakers threatening to block the 
accord unless the Administration demanded that Japan guarantee the United 
States a share of the production work on the plane and increased safeguards for 
American technology. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has been slow to respond to the U.S. demands, partly because Takeshita 
and other high officials have been tied up coping with the Recruit financial 
scandal in Japan.

The leaders of Japan's four major opposition parties have formed a united front 
to try to drive scandal-plagued Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita from office, a 
change that analysts now say is an increasingly likely possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The NHK broadcasting network reported Friday that leaders of the Socialist 
Party, the Clean Government Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the 
Social Democratic Federation had decided to press for Takeshita's ouster and a 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said, after a week of damaging revelations, that it looked 
increasingly likely that Takeshita would to be forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese newspapers reported Friday that the prime minister had received 
a further $190,000 from the Recruit Co., the enterprise at the heart of the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, an aide admitted that Takeshita's political support group 
had received $226,000 in May, 1987, from the publishing and telecommunications 
group accused of trying to buy business and political favors. This was in 
addition to $150,000 that Takeshita had already admitted receiving as a 
donation from Recruit. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a large group within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party now see 
dumping Takeshita as the only way the party can avoid critical damage in future 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Three Cabinet ministers have been forced to resign in connection with the 
Recruit scandal, and 13 businessmen and senior civil servants have been 
arrested.

HAITI TROOPS STORM REBEL UNIT BARRACKS; 
</P>

AFTER 2 HOURS OF GUNFIRE, SOME MUTINEERS REPORTEDLY SURRENDER

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving forcefully to end a weeklong military mutiny, troops loyal to Haitian 
leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril stormed the barracks of the largest rebel unit 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At least some of the rebel soldiers of the Dessalines Barracks, which abuts 
Haiti's presidential palace in downtown Port-au-Prince, reportedly surrendered 
to an attacking force of the loyal Presidential Guard after more than two hours 
of intense artillery and machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight, another Presidential Guard detachment was reported 
racing toward the hilltop town of Petionville to try to subdue the 400-strong 
Leopard Battalion, a smaller armed rebel unit whose former commander led an 
unsuccessful coup d'etat against Avril last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign diplomats and civilians who monitored military radio 
channels during the assault said it was unclear late Friday whether all or only 
some of the Dessalines Battalion dissidents had surrendered. One diplomat said 
at least some die-hard mutineers were holding out in the barracks, but that 
there had been a cease-fire to sort out the confusion of identically uniformed 
rebel and loyalist soldiers shooting at each other. 
</P>
<P>
There were no confirmed reports of casualties, but the intensity of the gunfire 
that shook the capital city from 7:40 p.m. until almost 10 p.m. prompted a 
European envoy to say "there must have been some." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat said that at least some civilians who live in the neighborhood 
of the palace and the adjoining barracks had been hit by stray artillery 
shells. "It was a disaster," he said. Late in the evening, the state-owned 
radio station issued an appeal from Haiti's Red Cross for all available 
ambulances to come to the area. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy shelling, which echoed throughout the city, apparently blew a large 
enough passage in the high concrete wall that divides the palace from the 
barracks to open the way for several armored vehicles and soldiers of the 
Presidential Guards to storm the rebel stronghold, according to a woman who 
observed the action. 
</P>
<P>
She said one of the four-wheeled armored cars appeared to have been put out of 
commission by the rebels' defensive fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Government Is in Control' 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man who answered the palace telephone said late in the evening 
that "the government is in control of the situation." He identified himself 
only as a civilian aide to the president. 
</P>
<P>
Another source who asked to remain anonymous said Avril had called for a camera 
crew from the National Television station to come to the palace and film a 
presidential address for broadcast sometime during the night. The station has 
been off the air since Thursday evening, when it was fired on by soldiers from 
the Leopard Battalion. The government said two Leopards were killed in the 
station attack, but a spokesmen for the rebel army unit said Friday morning 
that 12 Leopards died. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fighting appeared to be stalled early today, diplomats cautioned 
that it was not ended because the main force of the Leopard Battalion had not 
been subdued and there were believed still to be some Dessalines holdouts in 
the downtown barracks. 
</P>
<P>
One wandering Dessalines private appeared with his automatic rifle at the 
Holiday Inn Hotel, about 500 yards from the fighting, where about a dozen 
foreign journalists sheltered during the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just trying to intimidate the Dessalines," he said with bravado. "It 
would be impossible for them to take us without killing all the Dessalines in 
the barracks." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had not joined his comrades in defense of the rebel barracks, he 
smiled ruefully and said, "If you're a soldier, when you put your head in the 
streets you could get killed. When the shooting stops, I'll go." 
</P>
<P>
Haiti's week of military turmoil began Sunday when Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, then 
commander of the Leopards, joined two colonels, Philippe Biamby of the 
Presidential Guard and Leonce Qualo of Army Headquarters, in an attempt to 
overthrow Avril. 
</P>
<P>
Avril, who was installed as president during a coup by enlisted men last 
September, escaped with the help of another Leopards officer after spending 
hours under arrest with his wife and other relatives, including his 14-year-old 
son and 88-year-old mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
When Avril exiled the three coup plotters to the United States the next day and 
dismissed seven others, the Dessalines and Leopards units rebelled and demanded 
that he resign, setting off renewed turmoil.

U.S. ACCUSES SOVIETS OF PLANTING 'BUGS' IN LENINGRAD CONSULATE 
</P>

<P>
In an incident sure to add new friction to the superpower rivalry, the U.S. 
government Friday accused the Soviet Union of planting electronic listening 
devices in the U.S. Consulate in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said the bugs, which apparently had been in place for 
years, were discovered in February during a security inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"Such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering -- however long ago they may 
have been initiated -- are deeply resented by the American people," the 
department said in a statement to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The consulate, which opened in 1973, handles relatively low-level diplomacy, 
such as assisting U.S. businessmen and interceding on behalf of Americans who 
run into trouble with Soviet law. For this reason, the Soviet eavesdropping is 
considered to be less damaging than electronic surveillance at the embassy in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the State Department said that a new embassy building in Moscow was 
honeycombed with sophisticated listening devices. As a result of the discovery 
of the bugs, the U.S. government refused to move into the embassy from a 
dilapidated building nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Steps Due 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to announce soon the steps 
the U.S. government will take to assure itself that officials' conversations in 
the Moscow embassy will be private. Recommendations range from tearing down the 
building and starting over, to a partial reconstruction of the most sensitive 
areas of the facility. The cost of demolishing and rebuilding the embassy has 
been estimated at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they believe the consulate can be made secure without such 
extreme measures. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department announced Friday that Baker would visit Moscow May 10-11 
for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Although the eavesdropping devices at the consulate apparently were left over 
from an earlier and harsher period of the Cold War, their discovery now is 
likely to produce new U.S.-Soviet tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has already signaled a more wary approach to the Soviet 
Union than was prevalent in the final years of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship has been buffeted in recent weeks by the revelation that the 
Soviet Union has sold high-performance warplanes to Libya and by continuing 
disputes over Latin America.

SHAMIR VISIT ENDS; U.S., ISRAEL AVERT OPEN BREAK

Despite elaborate public displays of solidarity, this week's U.S.-Israel talks 
about the Middle East peace process were often acrimonious, with the Israeli 
side threatening an open confrontation unless the Bush Administration softened 
its criticism of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, U.S. and 
Israeli sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his government were angered by President 
Bush's statement Monday that U.S. goals in the Middle East include "the end of 
the occupation and achievement of Palestinian political rights." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials interpreted those remarks as a tacit endorsement of the 
creation of some sort of entity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip controlled by 
the Palestine Liberation Organization. When Shamir and his party reached 
Washington on Wednesday, Israeli officials told their American counterparts 
that if Bush's comments, which he made after a meeting with Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak, accurately reflected U.S. policy, then the two countries were 
facing an open break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Put Our Dukes Up' 
</P>
<P>
One Israeli source characterized the attitude of the Israeli side this way: "We 
might as well put our dukes up and settle it right now." The source said Shamir 
left no doubt that Israel would refuse to go along with any plan that afforded 
even a remote chance that Arab armies might be moved into the West Bank or that 
included any sort of role for the PLO. The source said that Israel would not 
accept even a demilitarized Palestinian entity because pledges of peaceful 
intent could be violated. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official conceded that the Israelis were angry when they 
arrived. But he said the troubles were smoothed over during the course of 
Shamir's visit, which ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis came here feeling bruised," the official said. "They are 
naturally paranoid and feel they are boxed into a corner. There certainly is no 
desire in the Administration to undercut the Israelis. We do want to work 
toward the same goal. But we have different tactics. There is no question about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Israelis Mollified 
</P>
<P>
"They came away feeling a lot better than when they came here," the official 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said the confrontation was defused by Bush's qualified 
endorsement of Shamir's proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
to choose Palestinians willing to negotiate terms for limited self-government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear the United States has decided to walk with us," one Israeli said. 
"Both sides wanted to find a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told a White House press conference Friday that although he was not elated 
with Shamir's election plan, "In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can . 
. . prove to be fruitful." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the answer is to get on with the elections," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Washington and Jerusalem may have very different understandings of 
what the elections will look like. U.S. officials clearly expect PLO-backed 
candidates to sweep the elections. But Israeli officials say they expect the 
balloting to select Palestinian leaders independent of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the PLO would have a role in the elections, Bush said: "We haven't 
fully resolved exactly who's going to have a role, but I think that's a matter 
to be determined by -- between the parties. . . . The PLO has people living on 
the West Bank, as you know, and we want to see elections that are free and fair 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said he has not changed his view that two key U.N. Security Council 
resolutions require Israel to yield at least part of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Shamir has argued that Israel met the conditions outlined by the 
resolutions when it returned the Sinai to Egypt a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel that the provisions of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 
have been fulfilled," Bush said. "The territory that has been ceded for peace 
(so far) is not the end. It simply isn't." 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions require Israel to withdraw from territory seized in the 1967 
Middle East war. The United States has long interpreted that to mean that 
Israel should yield most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, although some 
adjustments to the pre-1967 borders would be acceptable. Arab parties have 
insisted that the resolutions require Israel to withdraw from all occupied 
land, including East Jerusalem and part of what is now the main Jerusalem-Tel 
Aviv highway. 
</P>
<P>
Under Shamir's election plan, Palestinians would be selected to negotiate with 
Israel over an interim "autonomy" plan which would allow the Arabs to run their 
own domestic affairs but would retain Israeli control over security. Shamir 
also has promised to negotiate a final settlement following the autonomy 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories and the PLO at its headquarters 
in Tunis announced their rejection of the plan Friday. However, both Israeli 
and American officials have expressed hope that the elections can be structured 
in a way that would attract wide Palestinian participation. 
</P>
<P>
When State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was asked if Washington expects 
Palestinians to participate in the elections, he said, "The Palestinians' 
decisions probably depend on how the details are worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Another Administration official said most Palestinians' "natural inclination is 
to reject anything Shamir will propose because it comes from Shamir." But he 
added, "Palestinians should take a look at this because it is a more positive 
approach from the Israeli side than they have ever heard before."

The Polish Parliament on Friday approved laws introducing radical political 
reforms, and the banned Solidarity union swiftly called on its members to 
contest elections liberalized under the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Solidarity, which will be legalized under the reforms, said in a 
statement: "We expect that activists of our union will be on the lists of 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by Solidarity's National Executive Commission said: "We 
deem it necessary that all the union's structures and all the union's members 
agree that Solidarity enters legal public life during the electoral campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member commission, Solidarity's top body, met in Warsaw after Parliament 
passed six laws containing constitutional and political changes agreed to by 
the Communist government and the Solidarity-led opposition in talks that ended 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, the Communist world's first independent trade union, has boycotted 
all parliamentary elections since it was suppressed under martial law in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
It had previously said it was undecided if it would contest the elections, set 
for June. 
</P>
<P>
The 460-member Sejm (Parliament) overwhelmingly approved the six laws after a 
brief debate. 
</P>
<P>
Under a political deal at the talks, the opposition will have 35% of the Sejm 
seats and freely contest for seats in the Senate.

SULLIVAN ORDERS HEALTH OFFICIALS TO REVISE SEX PRACTICES SURVEY

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, responding to criticism 
from Budget Director Richard G. Darman, ordered public health officials Friday 
to revise a survey that would probe the sexual lives of thousands of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said he was acting to ensure that the federal government does not 
inappropriately intrude into the most personal aspects of citizens' lives, 
while balancing the need to gain a better understanding of how the deadly AIDS 
virus is being spread. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, the secretary said his "initial review of 
the survey instrument does indicate to me potential problems with the tone and 
content of the questions." 
</P>
<P>
He said he ordered the Public Health Service to conduct a "thorough review and 
revision" of the survey to assure it is scientifically sound and "sensitive and 
appropriate to the proper role of government in gathering information of the 
most personal nature." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan acted after Darman told him in a letter: "I have a great deal of 
difficulty understanding how many of the questions are related to essential 
public interests." 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Management and Budget, which Darman heads, must approve all 
government surveys as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act, but only for 
purposes of reducing federal paper work. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project includes a pilot survey of 2,300 Americans to learn the 
intimate details of their sexual lives, including when they last had sex, what 
they did and whether their partner was a man or woman. A subsequent survey, at 
an estimated cost of $15 million, would question 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the survey is intended to produce a comprehensive picture 
of Americans' sexual behavior to help health experts plan strategies to fight 
the spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus and other sexually 
transmitted diseases.

HISTORIANS TENDING TO SUPPORT PARDON OF NIXON

<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years after Gerald R. Ford's post-Watergate pardon of Richard M. Nixon 
shocked the nation and gravely wounded his presidency, that action is getting 
more favorable reviews from historians than it got back then from the public, 
political leaders and even some of those same historians. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen E. Ambrose, respected biographer of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and 
Nixon, "cursed and screamed" when he first heard of the pardon. But now, 
Ambrose told a conference on the Ford presidency that concludes here today, he 
believes that "Ford was absolutely right to do what he did." 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been something he had to do, but he still deserves credit for 
doing it forthrightly, courageously, at his own expense and quickly," Ambrose 
said. "The last thing this country needed in 1975-76 was to tear itself yet 
further apart over the fate of Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
That view summed up the apparent majority sentiment among scholars and 
political figures participating in the conference, sponsored by Long Island's 
Hofstra University. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, the seventh in a series on modern presidents, ranged 
over many aspects of Ford's 30-month presidency. But the still-smoldering 
controversy over the pardon was of special salience, with two panel discussions 
devoted to it, because rarely has any single decision by any President had such 
fateful consequences for his tenure in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
Ford pardoned Nixon on Sept. 8, 1974, a month before the Watergate cover-up 
trial of high Nixon aides and before any legal action had been taken against 
the resigned President. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the right thing to do," said Donald H. Rumsfeld, Ford's former White 
House chief of staff and secretary of defense. "But it was probably not at the 
right time. And certainly a high price was paid." 
</P>
<P>
Many at the conference suggested that the pardon, more than any other factor, 
had sealed the doom of Ford's 1976 presidential campaign against Democratic 
challenger Jimmy Carter. And Ford himself, addressing an audience of high 
school students here Friday, said the pardon "unquestionably was a factor" in 
his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ford explained, as he has in the past, that his main motive was to close out a 
disruptive and distracting episode. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally decided that I should spend all my time on the problems of all 
Americans and not 25% of my time on the problems of one man," the 75-year-old 
former President said. "It was an easy decision when you put it in that 
context." 
</P>
<P>
Scholars who now support Ford's action say their view in part is shaped by the 
fact that, despite intensive research in the Nixon and Ford records, no 
persuasive evidence has been turned up to support suspicion rife at the time 
that the two men had made a cynical agreement to trade the presidency for a 
reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing more than 40 former Ford aides in connection with a 
forthcoming book on the Ford and Nixon presidencies, J. Robert Greene, a 
Cazenovia (N.Y.) College professor, said in an interview: "There is nobody you 
can talk to in the Ford Administration who believes there was a deal" under 
which Nixon agreed to resign in return for a Ford promise to pardon him. 
</P>
<P>
But the major factor accounting for the present positive consensus on the 
pardon seems to be just the mellowness that comes with the passage of the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't divorce historians from the passions of their time," said Hofstra 
political scientist Bernard J. Firestone, director of the conference, who 
contended that scholars have a more balanced perspective on the issue in 1989 
than they did in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Those who now give the pardon at least qualified approval include even some 
scholars regarded as stern Nixon critics, such as University of Wisconsin 
historian and Watergate chronicler Stanley I. Kutler. 
</P>
<P>
Kutler told the conference that Ford's action "had substantial merit" and 
amounted to "a brave decision" that enabled him to "get on with the business of 
running the government." 
</P>
<P>
Kutler argued that, by granting Nixon the pardon -- which, he pointed out, the 
U.S. Supreme Court has held carries with it "an imputation of guilt" -- Ford 
had obtained for the country what amounted to a legal judgment on Nixon's 
behavior. Such a finding, he said, could otherwise have been gained only after 
a long trial, with the outcome problematical at best. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kutler contended that the newly installed chief executive erred 
by failing to line up support from other political figures in both parties 
before announcing his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have called in the congressional leaders and said, 'Look guys, this 
thing (the public preoccupation with Nixon and Watergate) is killing us,' " 
Kutler said in an interview. In this way, he argued, Ford could have persuaded 
other politicians to back his action, instead of condemning it, as most did. 
</P>
<P>
But some at the conference questioned whether there would in reality have been 
any way for Ford to grant the pardon without stirring an uproar and hurting 
himself politically. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you decide to do it, and do it quickly, you almost can't do it right," 
said Jerry H. Jones, former Nixon and Ford White House aide, pointing to the 
public resentment and suspicion of Nixon in the wake of Watergate. " 
</P>
<P>
In another analysis of the pardon prepared for the conference, Louisiana State 
University professor William D. Pederson attributed much of the initial 
criticism to "the low regard" that the critics had for Nixon. "His (Nixon's) 
Machiavellian nature" intensified suspicions about Ford's behavior, Pederson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But, after reviewing Ford's overall record on granting amnesty, clemency and 
pardons in other cases, including to Vietnam draft resisters, and the clemency 
records of other presidents, Pederson contended: "The evidence suggests that 
the pardon (of Nixon) was an act of magnanimous rather than Machiavellian 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The pardon was also defended from a constitutional standpoint by Mary 
Washington College professor Mark J. Rozell. In a study prepared for the 
conference, Rozell cited a range of legal authorities and precedents to rebut 
criticism that the pardon was illegal because it was granted prior to a 
conviction or because it was too vague or interfered with the authority of the 
special Watergate prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Rozell contended that the pardon was justified because, with the tremendous 
publicity given to the disclosures of his Watergate misconduct, Nixon would 
have had a hard time getting a fair trial had he been indicted. 
</P>
<P>
"The pardon of Richard M. Nixon failed to put Watergate immediately behind us, 
and it harmed President Ford's efforts to heal the nation of its cynicism 
toward political Washington," Rozell conceded. "But, from a legal standpoint, 
and from the standpoint of serving justice, his decision was justified."

A federal judge Friday overrode U.S. immigration officials and ordered a Dutch 
visitor suffering from AIDS released from prison so he can attend a conference 
in San Francisco on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Robert Vinikoor said Hans Paul Verhoef had met standards 
required to allow him to be excluded from laws barring foreigners with 
dangerous and communicable diseases from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
"While I don't want to minimize the risk of AIDS, the applicant has shown there 
is a minimal risk to the United States if he is admitted on a temporary basis," 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials immediately asked the 
federal Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, Va., to stay the judge's 
order. But Friday night the board refused to consider the request, said Thomas 
Schiltgen, INS district director in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Verhoef boarded a flight for San Francisco at 7:25 p.m. at the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul International Airport. The five-day AIDS conference ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Good!" Verhoef exclaimed after hearing the judge issue the order in the 
courtroom, where he was handed a bouquet of pink roses by supporters. Later, 
Verhoef spoke to reporters at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that I can do what I have to do, now that the U.S. government 
has let me go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed being imprisoned and getting this treatment in this 
country," he said, adding that he was disturbed about having to raise a $10,000 
bond before leaving Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Vinikoor ordered Verhoef to post a $10,000 bond to enforce the terms of 
the waiver, which is in effect until April 28. The money was provided by 
supporters of the Minnesota AIDS Project within a few hours of the judge's 
ruling, said Helene Haapala, one of Verhoef's lawyers.

A federal judge on Friday overrode U.S. immigration officials and ordered a 
Dutch visitor suffering from AIDS to be released from prison so he can attend a 
conference in San Francisco on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Robert Vinikoor said Hans Paul Verhoef had met standards 
required to be granted a waiver from laws barring foreigners with certain 
contagious diseases from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
"While I don't want to minimize the risk of AIDS, the applicant has shown there 
is a minimal risk to the United States if he is admitted on a temporary basis," 
Vinikoor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orders $10,000 Bond 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, ordered Verhoef, who was detained by immigration officials 
last Sunday, to post a $10,000 bond to enforce the terms of the waiver, which 
is in effect until April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota AIDS Project supporters provided money for the bond within a few 
hours of the judge's ruling. Verhoef hoped to fly to San Francisco in time to 
attend the last day of the four-day conference today. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision overrode the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's 
action earlier in the day. The INS denied Verhoef's request for a waiver to 
attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk of harm by an AIDS-infected alien in the absence of humanitarian 
reasons for the temporary admission of aliens far outweighs the privilege of an 
alien to enter the United States to participate in a conference," Richard 
Norton, associate commissioner for examinations, wrote in the INS ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Emergency Appeal 
</P>
<P>
The INS sought to file an emergency appeal of Vinikoor's decision, but a 
special immigration court turned down the bid. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling echoed Thursday's recommendation by the INS district 
director in St. Paul, who had said Verhoef should be allowed to attend the 
conference. The opposite stance by INS officials in Washington drew fire from 
Dr. Tim Wolfred, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"The INS has decided to enforce a law founded on hatred, bigotry and 
ignorance," he said. "This decision says the federal government has no 
compassion for people with HIV disease or understanding of how AIDS is 
transmitted."

BUSH VOWS GREATER FEDERAL ROLE IN OIL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, insisting that he has not waited too long, pledged on Friday 
that the federal government would now assume a greater role in bringing about 
"the complete restoration of the ecology and the economy of Prince William 
Sound" in Alaska, fouled in last month's oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"The job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the affected land areas 
will be massive, prolonged and frustrating. Nothing we can do will totally 
resolve this problem in the short-term. Rather, we must be prepared for a long, 
sustained effort," said Bush, who has been criticized for waiting two weeks 
before stepping up federal control over the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that as part of the increased federal role, he dispatched Adm. Paul 
Yost Jr., the Coast Guard commandant, to lead the cleanup effort and said that 
military personnel and federal equipment would be used in "direct cleanup 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
The President also called for a program of enlisting volunteers to help in the 
cleanup during the summer, and ordered a nationwide review of plans to deal 
with such environmental emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops' Role Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
Military officials predicted that as many as 1,500 troops may eventually be 
deployed, but they and other government officials in Washington and Alaska 
remained uncertain whether troops would actually join crews cleaning beaches 
and wildlife, as some had believed Thursday, or would provide logistic support. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney portrayed the Pentagon's role as largely one of 
support, involving cargo flights, the expansion of the limited-operation Valdez 
Airport, and the use of Navy vessels "to house, feed and provide comfort for 
those who are involved in the cleanup effort." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it was unknown how much the overall effort would cost and how 
long it would take. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper hailed the President's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears the President is meeting the objectives we have in asking the Coast 
Guard to take over the oil spill cleanup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and other Administration officials, defending the pace of the government's 
involvement, said their first goal had been to see that the oil remaining on 
the disabled Exxon Valdez was removed safely and that the tanker was extricated 
from the reef it had struck in the sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Corp., which owns the tanker, directed that recovery effort, which 
has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The next step, the officials said, was the long-term task of sopping up the 
2,500-square-mile oil slick caused by the 10-million-gallon spill and restoring 
the once-pristine beaches and rocky coves. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics in Washington and Alaska were not convinced that the response 
was sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Interior Committee's 
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, completed a tour of 
the spill area and said through an aide in Washington: "The situation . . . is 
still out of control but we welcome any response. Tragically the Administration 
has been paralyzed in making decisions on the spill for the past two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
He and others in Congress and in Alaska have maintained that the federal 
government should have stepped in to directly coordinate the cleanup 
immediately after the accident, rather than allowing Exxon to retain extensive 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, responding to such complaints in his White House news conference, 
asserted that federal "action started immediately." 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing was to get the ship -- stop the hemorrhaging and get that ship 
moved," he said, and Exxon did so. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting its expanded role, the Pentagon announced that it had created a 
joint task force, commanded by Lt. Gen. Thomas G. McInerny, head of the Alaskan 
Air Command. An initial task was to coordinate the use of 675 tons of military 
oil-skimming equipment, including 20 boats and 22,000 feet of oil-trapping 
booms already in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
McInerny, accompanied by two colonels, arrived at the Coast Guard building in 
Valdez three hours after Bush made his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The general, said Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt, "made it clear he has 
literally the whole armed forces to draw from -- people to hardware." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the oil spill has not dissuaded him from pressing ahead with 
plans to explore for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or off the 
coasts of California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that you can predicate a sound national energy policy on an 
aberration that seemed to have taken place in Prince William Sound. For those 
that do, I say, please, let me follow logically. Are you suggesting because of 
the alleged human error of a pilot of a ship in Prince William Sound that we 
shut down all the offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico? Is that the 
suggestion? If so, I oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Melissa Healy and Paul Houston in Washington and Larry B. Stammer 
and Mark A. Stein in Alaska contributed to this story.

BUSH: NORTH LEGAL CASE SHOULD BE 'UNFETTERED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are excerpts from President Bush's news conference Friday: 
</P>
<P>
Contra Aid 
</P>
<P>
Question: How do you reconcile your efforts to arrange third-country military 
aid for the Contras with the spirit of the ban by Congress on aid to the 
rebels? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Look, I am not going to comment on any aspect of the North trial while 
it's in progress. If I even commented on your question, it could prejudice the 
trial that's going to be -- and that would be totally unfair. 
</P>
<P>
And I would note that of all the material that you seem to be referring to and 
that has been introduced, all the material that was introduced yesterday, 
material you're referring to, has been available to the independent counsel, 
and the Iran-Contra committee, and has been reviewed by them for any special 
significance. So I believe the legal process ought to run unfettered, without 
you or me endangering the trial process that's going on right now. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know you don't want to talk about it, but Sen. (Edmund S.) Muskie, former 
Sen. Muskie, who was a member of the Tower Commission, says he was not aware of 
this effort to involve the Hondurans, or of your role. You have said this was 
available to the Tower Commission. Do you want to reply to that, without 
prejudicing Oliver North? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President -- . 
</P>
<P>
A: Because I don't want to prejudice the trial, John. It would be imprudent for 
us to do that, and we're not going to do it. And I stand by my statement about 
the Iran-Contra committee. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will you speak after the trial? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do your statements today mean that you won't discuss this Contra affair? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. It means I've said all I want to say about it! Look, we're having a 
briefing on Alaska. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Oil Spill 
</P>
<P>
Q: A number of local officials in Alaska, as well as Alaskan residents, have 
been (calling) virtually since the spill took place for a greater federal role. 
. . . Why has it taken so long to reach this conclusion, and hasn't valuable 
time been lost during your deliberations? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, as you may recall, action started immediately. The big thing was to 
get the ship -- stop the hemorrhaging, and get that ship moved. I immediately 
asked the head of the Coast Guard, and the head of the Department of 
Transportation, and Bill Reilly to go up there. . . . There is no demand from 
reasonable people to federalize this operation, and that is not going to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
So what have we done? The flow was stopped. . . . And now the cleanup phase 
comes and it's the time when we can step up some activity. So, something has 
gone on. I'm not about to defend the status quo, but there is no desire on our 
part to federalize. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, you've used words like "deadly" and "tragic" and "disastrous" 
to describe this oil spill. During the campaign, you said you were an 
environmentalist. Have you had any opportunity to rescind your commitment to 
drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge as a result of this disaster? 
</P>
<P>
A: . . . No, I don't think that -- I don't think that you -- that you 
compromise the genuine national security interests of this country. And I don't 
think that you can predicate a sound national energy policy on an aberration 
that seemed to have taken place in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Arms Control 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, Mr. Gorbachev today made another arms control gesture, saying 
that he'll stop production of weapons-grade uranium and shut down two plutonium 
plants. What's your response, or reaction? 
</P>
<P>
A: . . . We'll be ready to react when we feel like reacting, and when we have 
prudently made our -- our reviews upon which to act. . . . I haven't seen it 
analyzed, Lesley, so I honestly can't tell you that I know the full 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast 
</P>
<P>
. . . We've had two visits here now this week -- (Egyptian) President (Hosni) 
Mubarak, (Israeli) Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Shamir. We'll have a visit, a 
forthcoming visit from (Jordan's) King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
And I'm going to give the same assurances to him I've given to Mubarak and 
Shamir, and that is that if I personally can be helpful (in the peace process), 
I want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
. . . But I would simply say it is not a time where a lot of high-visibility 
missions on the part of the President can accommodate -- can be helpful in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you believe the PLO should have a role in independent elections in Israel 
-- West Bank? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that the answer is to get on with the elections and I've -- I'd like 
to -- we haven't fully resolved exactly who's going to have a role but I think 
that's a matter to be determined by -- between the parties -- but I'd leave it 
right there. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me if you believe the political agreement reached in Poland 
this week could be a model for political reform throughout Eastern Europe? . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
A: . . . I would say that the round-table development there in Poland is very 
positive, and I would certainly commend the parties getting together there. I 
go back to when we were there not very many months ago, and many of you were 
with me on that trip. 
</P>
<P>
I think the situation has moved so fast since that trip that I took a year or 
two ago that it's mind-boggling. . . .

NEW FRONT OPENED IN OIL SPILL BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
BOOMS RUSHED ALONG GULF OF ALASKA AS SLICK MOVES OUT 100 MILES

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As thick ribbons of oily mousse glided 100 miles into the Gulf of Alaska, 
threatening a national park, state and federal officials opened a second front 
in their battle to contain the nation's largest oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Booms to contain the advancing menace were rushed to the towns of Seward and 
Homer and to Kodiak Island, which is nearly 300 miles from the spill site in 
Prince William Sound. Exxon and federal scientists estimate that about half the 
oil lost in the spill has exited the sound and entered the Gulf of Alaska, 
creeping south at between 15 and 20 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another sea mammal rescue and recovery center was being 
opened in Seward, 100 miles southwest of Valdez on the scenic Kenai Peninsula, 
at a time when the Valdez center was being taxed beyond its capacity to care 
for growing numbers of otters and sea birds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat Heads Westward 
</P>
<P>
"We're beginning to move our resources westward to contain the potential threat 
to the Gulf of Alaska," Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
So far, efforts to protect Prince William Sound's four salmon hatcheries have 
been successful. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple booms have been stretched in front of their entrances. But officials 
and fishermen alike kept a wary eye on weather reports. 
</P>
<P>
While there are no immediate indications of a storm, they warned that should a 
"southeasterner" blow in with gale-force winds, damage in the sound could be 
doubled and the salmon hatcheries decimated. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a southeasterner, we'll have hundreds of miles of beaches 
impacted," Alaska Environmental Conservation Commissioner Dennis D. Kelso said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the strength and longevity of the storm, it would easily double 
the area that's impacted now," he warned, and for the first time stain the 
Kenai Fjords National Park. The park, with its coastline of dramatic oceanfront 
canyons and rocky inlets, is located on the Kenai Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure some of it will be hitting the park. I'm just not sure what 
quantity," Kelso said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Kelso issued an emergency order, effective immediately, imposing 
strict new rules on the Valdez oil terminal and threatening the oil industry 
with criminal and civil penalties if it fails to follow the state's new 
get-tough policy. The order calls for limited oil tanker loading at the 
terminal until a long list of spill equipment is in place. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grim and often disheartening task of attempting to save injured 
birds and animals continued unabated here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Efforts Not Enough

As of Friday, 85 oil-soaked sea otters have been retrieved from the 
once-pristine sound and rushed to the animal recovery center here. But half of 
those animals have died, despite the best efforts of an overworked team of 
volunteers and marine mammal experts. 
</P>
<P>
A pathologist has been brought to Valdez to conduct necropsies on the dead 
animals, trying to find a way to cut the losses. Results of tissue sample 
analyses are due within days, said Suzanne Stolpe of the rescue center. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 109 dead otters have been turned into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, bringing the official otter death toll to 151 otters. But, scientists 
believe that an untold number of dead seals and otters have either been swept 
out to sea or sank to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the otters were shipped by the rescue center to Sea World in San Diego, 
but only three remain alive. 
</P>
<P>
Some 166 birds have been rescued, but 60 of those died. Another 300 dead birds 
were turned over to the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Williams, a veterinarian with the Monterey Bay Aquarium, said sea otters 
often will not fight to live. 
</P>
<P>
"A cat will fight with you. But an otter will just look at you with those eyes 
and say, 'sayonara, I'm going,' " said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
For several days, the animal rescue center was unable to handle the volume of 
otters being brought in from the sound, and the Fish and Wildlife Service 
ordered a halt to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Otter Transfer Stopped 
</P>
<P>
And, when state officials here attempted to dispatch 12 sick otters to 
Vancouver, British Columbia, to be cared for by experts at the Vancouver 
Aquarium, the Fish and Wildlife Service prohibited the transfer because travel 
is extremely stressful for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, a rag-tag fleet of fishing boats and volunteers organized by 
Kelley Weaverling of Cordova was ordered to halt its otter rescues. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like it at all," Weaverling said. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaska Fish and Game Department said it may be "years" before Prince 
William Sound can support the levels of fish and wildlife that existed before 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
It said some areas such as marshes may be affected for decades by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
There are between 300,000 and 400,000 birds resident in the sound now and 
another 1 million waterfowl and 10 million shore birds will pass through the 
sound within weeks on their way to interior breeding areas or elsewhere in 
coastal Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some May Be Safe 
</P>
<P>
Many of these birds, the state said, will safely pass over the eastern portion 
of the sound not affected by the spill. Others, however, will pass through area 
severely hit by the March 24 spill from the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no bald eagles -- the national symbol -- have been found dead, but 
biologists believe it is only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Green Island, reporters found an oil-soiled dead duck that 
had apparently been eaten by an eagle. The duck was found below an eagle's 
nest. There is concern that as eagles and other predators ingest the oil on the 
carcasses of birds and mammals that they will begin to die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takes Many Forms 
</P>
<P>
Overflights by specialists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration indicate that the slick is taking on many different forms. In 
Prince William Sound, the oil remains thick and heavy along the eastern shore 
of Knight Island and the northern fringes of Green and Smith Islands. In these 
areas, it is a frothy mousse or thick pancake. 
</P>
<P>
As it enters the sound, it dissipates somewhat, as smoke wafts from a 
cigarette. In the gulf, the goo ranges from a very thin iridescent sheen on the 
water to windrows, or ribbons, of pale brown mousse outlined in vivid violet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's looking more like a thin layer of latex paint on the water," said Hal 
Alabaster of NOAA. "Brown and orange latex paint."

37-MONTH TERM GIVEN MAN FOR CROSS BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Westminster man who fanned racial fears last summer when he burned a 
four-foot wooden cross in the yard of a black family was ordered Friday to 
spend 37 months in prison for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, describing the cross burning as 
outrageous in its racial bigotry, opted for the harshest punishment that he 
could give Gary Skillman, 24, under 1984 sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Skillman, who gave several conflicting statements about the incident but 
declined to testify at his trial, told the judge in a Santa Ana courtroom 
before sentencing: "I have nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
Left to puzzle over the actions of a man described as a white supremacist were 
Alvin and Lillie Heisser, the targets of the burning. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would someone do something like this? We've been trying to find an answer 
to that for over 200 years," said Alvin Heisser, a past president of the local 
NAACP chapter. While satisfied with the sentence, Heiser said the painful 
memories "will never go away. It'll be there forever -- burning in you." 
</P>
<P>
Skillman will remain in federal custody pending an appeal of the verdict and 
sentencing, according to his attorney.

VAN DE KAMP SUPPORTS GENETIC CODE BANK USING BLOOD TO SOLVE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Data on blood samples taken from criminals convicted of certain sex and 
violence crimes would be kept in a statewide computerized genetic code bank to 
help solve future crimes, under legislation endorsed Friday by state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "genetic fingerprint" of each blood sample would provide a unique 
biological profile of each felon that could match up with blood, semen or body 
tissue at crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
California is one of several states considering such a data base. Other states 
have already used the technique as key evidence to convict several rapists, and 
Van de Kamp gave his approval earlier this year to use such evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Los Angeles Friday, Van de Kamp cited a federal study 
showing that nearly two-thirds of those released from state prison are arrested 
for new crimes within three years, and said the legislation to create the 
centralized Cal-DNA data base will help officials to deal with 
repeat-offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep these people longer than the law allows," said Van de Kamp. "But 
we can try to make sure that they are caught and shipped straight back to 
prison as fast as possible if they commit new crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said the data base would "not only be used to establish convictions 
but to exonerate the innocent." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, proposed by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), would require 
that those convicted of murder, assault or battery provide blood samples when 
they are imprisoned, and current felons would provide the samples when they are 
paroled or discharged from custody. Sex crime offenders already must do so. 
</P>
<P>
Each sample would be analyzed for DNA data, each person's unique genetic 
blueprint, and stored in a statewide computer network similar to the present 
Cal-ID fingerprint bank. Its information would be made available to every 
police and sheriff's department in the state, Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The minutely accurate technique was developed in Great Britain in 1985, and can 
be used on blood, semen or tissue samples. Each convicted criminal's genetic 
"profile" stored in the data bank could be compared to DNA-analyzed evidence 
found at crime scenes, much as fingerprints are now. 
</P>
<P>
The odds that two individuals will share a similar genetic "profile" are about 
1 in 10 million, although Van de Kamp said earlier this year that 
theoretically, the odds were "30 billion to 1" that two people would have the 
same DNA structure. Van de Kamp contends that fingerprints, with odds running 
64 billion to 1 against duplicate sets, are not always clear or available, and 
give "much weaker identification." 
</P>
<P>
In California, a man charged with 63 counts of rape faces a June trial in 
Orange County based on DNA matching. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors have used 60 human hairs found at a death scene to 
allegedly link a suspect to the crime, and Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner declared in 
February that the genetic fingerprinting technique would be used to prosecute 
two men in the rape and murder of a Pasadena woman. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's bill would require a central DNA laboratory created in conjunction with 
UC Berkeley, and regional laboratories in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego 
counties, and the San Francisco Bay Area.

A bomb caused extensive damage to the offices of the U.S.-Chilean Cultural 
Institute on Thursday night, and a caller said that the device was set off in 
retaliation for the now-ended U.S. embargo on Chilean fruit, institute director 
Augusta Crino said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the explosion, which broke windows and damaged office 
equipment in the three-story building in central Santiago. Crino said the 
institute received an anonymous telephone call soon after the blast from a man 
who said "the U.S. had to pay for the fruit." 
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed a five-day embargo on Chilean fruit last month after 
cyanide was found in two grapes.

BAIL REFUSED FOR FORMER HUSBAND OF AISSA WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Friday ordered Pomona physician Thomas A. Gionis held without bail 
pending his criminal trial for allegedly ordering an attack on his ex-wife, 
Aissa Wayne, and her boyfriend, millionaire financier Roger Luby. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom ruled that Gionis, 35, an orthopedic 
surgeon, poses a danger of flight and a threat to Wayne, 32, daughter of the 
late actor John Wayne, if released. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had shown in a lengthy bail hearing Thursday that numerous overseas 
telephone calls had been made from Gionis' home to Greece, where he has friends 
and family. Last month, Gionis had also obtained a passport for his 2-year-old 
daughter, Anastasia, who is the subject of a bitter custody battle that police 
contend led to the attack on Wayne last fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Serious Risk' 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard not to consider that this client is an extremely serious risk to 
flee this jurisdiction," Bostrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorney, Byron K. McMillan, said he will appeal the bail decision to 
the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana on Monday. Gionis, meanwhile, was 
transferred Friday from the Newport City Jail to the Orange County Jail to 
await a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men are also in the Orange County Jail under $1-million bonds each on 
charges of carrying out the Oct. 3 attack at Luby's Newport Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 
35, of Simi Valley also appeared in Harbor Municipal Court on Friday for 
arraignments. Hintergardt entered a not guilty plea, while Bouey elected to 
postpone his arraignment until May 19. Bostrom ordered bail for both men to 
stand at $1 million each, as prosecutors allege that they, too, pose a 
substantial escape risk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warrant Issued 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant has been issued for a Century City private investigator, O. 
Daniel Gal, who worked on behalf of Gionis in the custody case and who police 
say hired Hintergardt to make the attack. Hintergardt once worked for Gal's 
investigation agency, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gal, who was interviewed by Newport Beach police after the attack, is believed 
to have fled to Europe. Newport police said Interpol, the international police 
agency headquartered in Paris, is trying to locate Gal for arrest and 
extradition.

L.A. PHILHARMONIC TO REPEAT PROGRAM AT THE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An orchestral program of Mozart, Richard Strauss and Brahms sounds about as 
predictable and familiar as possible. From these composers, however, Andre 
Previn drew a curious and audacious agenda for the Los Angeles Philharmonic on 
Thursday evening at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which repeats at the Orange County Performing Arts Center tonight, 
began with a small contingent of strings and timpani, huddled together in the 
middle of an otherwise empty stage. Their employment? The "Serenata Notturna" 
by Mozart, K. 239, a witty, effervescent contemporary of the much better-known 
"Haffner" Serenade. 
</P>
<P>
A comic concerto grosso, the serenade offered gracious, grateful solo work to 
violinists Sidney Weiss and Harold Dicterow, violist Dale Hikawa and bassist 
Christopher Hanulik, with the buffo timpani punctuation provided by Mitchell 
Peters. Previn kept matters well balanced and moving, though intonation 
suffered surprising lapses. 
</P>
<P>
The stage was not much more fully occupied for Strauss' "Metamorphosen." In 
style a sort of heroically swollen chamber music of the gods, in spirit an 
autumnal elegy, it received a suitably moody reading from Previn and 23 
strings, clean and taut but also sounding muted and remote in the Pavilion 
expanses. 
</P>
<P>
These chamber orchestra offerings were matched with Brahms' Violin Concerto. 
Contrast was clearly intended and inevitable, but soloist Joshua Bell also saw 
to it that there was a real measure of integration. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there was anything small-scale about his interpretation, although his 
sweet, slender tone was occasionally overwhelmed in the big climaxes. Indeed, 
his account was warmly expansive, restrained in tempos and generous in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
But it was expressed with the conversational directness of chamber music. 
Excepting some quirky accentuation, as in the beginning of the finale, it was 
without rhetorical exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Bell plays with a natural grace and simplicity, despite body language that 
suggests a man trying to jump out of shoes glued to the floor. He seized the 
bravura work with concentrated zest but left the deepest impression through 
winning, ardent lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
His substantial cadenza had in it much of Kreisler, as well as a fearlessly 
personal and piquant development of Brahms' Hungarianisms. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic backed Bell with a solid, cohesive effort, sonically ripe and 
focused. Previn maintained close contact with his soloist, reining in his 
orchestra's intermittent attempts to forge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Previn conducts violinist Joshua Bell and the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $30. Information: (714) 556-2787.

SOME SOLUTIONS OFFERED TO PROBLEMS OF 'UNDER-ATTENDERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was somewhat disturbed by the recent letter from Elaine Weiner of Villa Park 
("Some Reasons For Shunning Music Events," Feb 25). I feel compelled to respond 
on behalf of the many people who contribute time and money to assure her access 
to a broad range of classical music in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While she may bemoan the loss of the New World Festival for 1989, there is 
still plenty of good music available for her here, most of it by musicians as 
good as, and some better than, those in the New World Symphony. As important, 
this music is a available 52 weeks a year, not for just a short period in the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to some of her specific comments: While traffic is not fun, most of 
us have accepted it as a necessary part of life here. Getting to the Center by 
8 p.m. is not that difficult. Also, a book is available which has seating 
diagrams of all Southern California venues which makes buying tickets by phone 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Second, I believe most presenters have made a conscious effort to maintain a 
number of affordable seats. The Pacific Symphony, on whose board I serve, has 
seats available for every concert for under $10, not bad considering the 
economics of putting 100 musicians on stage. Indeed, the average classical 
concert loses at least $10,000, so even the least expensive seats are 
subsidized by people who think it is important to have live classical music 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Third, all of us who present music try to develop programs which are 
entertaining because we want our audience to enjoy the music and come back 
again. We also have an educational mission which we can accomplish, in part, by 
playing less-familiar music. What may be distasteful to one person is expanding 
the musical horizons of the person in the next seat. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, most presenters, the Pacific Symphony included, have opportunities for 
groups, such as schoolchildren, to attend concerts at greatly reduced rates, 
some free, when there are unsold seats. This would not only give Ms. Weiner an 
opportunity to hear a first-class orchestra but would provide a new experience 
for children in her classes and build tomorrow's audience. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County currently offers a tremendous variety of music for all tastes and 
at reasonable cost. If there is a problem, it is that there are too many Ms. 
Weiners who are under-attenders. Staying home does not make the situation 
better. The musicians need and deserve their support. I hope that Ms. Weiner 
and others of your readers will re-evaluate what we do have instead of what we 
don't, and start attending something regularly. They'll be glad they did.

MCCASKILL SHARP AS ANGELS EDGE MARINERS, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The media and fans may be focused on Jim Abbott's major league debut tonight, 
but Angel Manager Doug Rader was more concerned with the status of his fourth 
starter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
There are victories, and then there are victories, and you can bet Rader was 
hoping as much for a strong performance from Kirk McCaskill as he was for a win 
over the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's very, very important for us," Rader said before Friday night's 2-1 
Angel victory before 22,882 fans at Anaheim Stadium. "There's nothing 
physically wrong with Kirk, but if you're emotionally preoccupied, it can 
affect you physically. We need to get him into a better posture." 
</P>
<P>
The last time McCaskill pitched, his posture was slumping and so was the 
Angels' outlook for 1989. He pitched against Edmonton, the Angels' triple-A 
affiliate, in an exhibition game Sunday and allowed eight hits and nine runs in 
3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
That raised McCaskill's spring earned-run average to 6.49 and more than a few 
questions about his health and well-being. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, meanwhile, told Rader and his teammates not to panic. He was just 
trying too hard and had fallen into some bad habits. His problems were 
mechanical, not mental, he assured. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he didn't convince anybody right away Friday night. He retired the first 
three Mariners in order -- on three drives to the warning track -- and he 
yielded three hits, a walk and a run in the next two innings. But by the time 
McCaskill had finished seven innings, Rader and Co. were breathing a lot 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty obvious (McCaskill) doesn't put much credence in practice," Rader 
said, smiling. "I just wanted him to go out there and establish good stuff. To 
have happen what happened is a delight." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, the only Angel starter with a winning record (8-6) in 1988, allowed 
four hits, walked three, struck out two and picked up the win. Bryan Harvey 
allowed only one hit in the final two innings to get the save. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, who had dismissed the Edmonton debacle as "a no-win situation" 
earlier in the week, finally admitted that he took that pounding hard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult week for me," he said. "I wanted to do well to gear up 
for this start, and that performance bothered me. Finally, I was able to look 
at what I didn't do. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcel (Lachemann, Angel pitching coach) and I watched some videotapes of 1986 
and saw some things I was doing differently, and we made some changes." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill threw on Tuesday and regained a measure of confidence because he felt 
he had overcome the mechanical flaws in his delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Rader certainly had no complaints after Friday night's outing. 
</P>
<P>
"He got behind a few times in the early innings, but I wasn't concerned because 
he wasn't steering the ball like he had been," Rader said. "He was out there 
throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the way things have been going (for McCaskill), you certainly 
couldn't have predicted this. I'm tickled to death. Our run production is a 
concern, but I'd much rather have Kirk win one like this than by 9-8 at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Erik Hanson started for Seattle and held the Angels to five hits in six 
innings. But he walked the last batter he faced, catcher Lance Parrish, whom he 
had hit squarely in the side of the helmet in the second inning. Parrish 
eventually scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Jack Howell and scored when 
Brian Downing lined a single to right-center off reliever Mike Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the first when Wally Joyner, the ninth player in 
major league history to drive in 100 or more runs in each of his first two 
years before falling off to 85 last season, got his first RBI of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and Devon White on first, Joyner drove a shot to deep center. 
Nineteen-year-old rookie Ken Griffey Jr. retreated to the warning track and 
leaped, but the ball carried just over his glove and hit high on the wall for a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners tied the score with a run in the third. Edgar Martinez walked and 
then Omar Vizquel singled off the glove of second baseman Mark McLemore, who 
was recalled from Edmonton Thursday to replace injured second baseman Johnny 
Ray. Harold Reynolds lined a single to right to score Martinez, but McCaskill 
squirmed out of the jam by getting Griffey to pop up, Alvin Davis to line to 
right and Darnell Coles on a ground-ball forceout. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to get out of a jam for a change," McCaskill said. "The numbers 
might look OK tonight, but I'm not completely satisfied. I'm still struggling 
with my curveball. 
</P>
<P>
"But this sure as heck beats giving up 12 runs to the triple-A club." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Jim Abbott, who makes his first start tonight, is doing his best to 
avoid thinking about the ramifications of his much-ballyhooed jump from 
collegiate ball to the big leagues. "I'm trying not to read too much about it," 
he said. "I feel I belong here. I think the Angels feel I belong here. So I 
don't see how anyone else's vote is going to count too much. I worked as hard 
as I ever have, and I think that the spring showed I do belong here. If things 
go bad, things go bad. That won't necessarily be a reflection on the Angels' 
judgment about bringing me here." Manager Doug Rader, however, admits that the 
game carries some added significance. "The issue is for the kid to have some 
success," Rader said. "The (media) onslaught will perpetuate either way, but it 
would be nice if it took on a positive note rather than a negative one." . . . 
Abbott will face Mark Langston, one of the league's few left-handed power 
pitchers. Abbott, whose style has been likened to Langston's on more than one 
occasion, says he has closely followed the Mariner ace's career. "He's a great 
pitcher," Abbott said. "Now I have to tone down my astonishment of his pitches 
and throw some of my own." . . . Owner Gene Autry lifted the ban on alcoholic 
beverages in the Angel clubhouse Thursday night.

THE MASTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TREVINO STILL HOLDS THE LEAD, BUT HE HAS COMPANY IN FALDO

AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wind howled, the scores soared and Lee Trevino is still in the hunt to win 
the Masters, the only major championship that has eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who shot a 67 Thursday for the first-round lead, faltered to a 74 
Friday but still held a share of the lead with Britain's Nick Faldo, two 
strokes ahead of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, who was paired with Trevino, had a four-stroke edge over the 49-year-old 
veteran after 10 holes. 
</P>
<P>
But Faldo bogeyed the 11th, 16th and 17th holes, and Trevino got a birdie at 
No. 12 and then maintained a par pace the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
It rained during the night, but the Augusta National course was playable 
because a persistent, cold wind of about 20 m.p.h. dried the greens somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
The wind was such a factor that only seven players were under par after 36 
holes. Trevino and Faldo, who shot a 73, led the way at 141. They were followed 
by Ken Green, Mike Reid, Seve Ballesteros, Ben Crenshaw and Scott Hoch, all at 
143. 
</P>
<P>
Green had the low round of the day, a three-under-par 69. In fact, he was the 
only player who shot lower than 7l. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind was blowing pretty good, but the rain helped a lot to soften up the 
greens," Trevino said. "It didn't dry them out completely. I was just trying to 
figure out which way the wind was blowing. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a tough day. I figured that par (for the field) 
would be about 75, and if I shot a 75, or 76, I'd be OK." 
</P>
<P>
The closest Trevino has come to winning the Masters, a tournament that has 
frustrated him for 20 years, was a share of the lead in 1978 after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that if it keeps raining, he has a good shot at winning because the 
greens will hold his lower trajectory shots. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he smiled and said, "But from what I hear, the weather is clear from here 
to Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said that more wind, without rain, won't help him because the greens 
will get on the hard side. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stuck in there," said Trevino, who bogeyed two of the first three holes 
and had a birdie on the other. "I'm looking forward to the senior tour and the 
rest of this year and I want to gear up now." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino finished in a tie for 61st last week in a tournament at Houston. It was 
his first tour event in six months. In the last eight years, he has been only a 
part-time player because of television commitments and back problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had seen me play last week, you would have thought that I was in the 
fifth flight of the club championship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, who had a 68 Thursday, had three birdies through the first 10 holes, but 
came back to Trevino with his bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"Nick was playing extremely well, and I thought he was going to run away and 
hide," Trevino said. "I figured, though, that when I got that birdie at 12, I'd 
pick up a couple of shots on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, who is as terse in his comments as Trevino is loquacious, seemingly 
wasn't disturbed about blowing what could have been a sizable lead, considering 
the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to be right there now, and that's the object of the exercise," 
Faldo said. "Things went well until I messed up at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to evaluate the talkative Trevino as a playing partner, Faldo said 
sharply: "He was rooting me on. I usually count the number of strokes, not the 
number of times his mouth is open." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, a two-time winner of the Masters, had reason to be upset. He was 
four under par for the tournament after 14 holes, but he got a quadruple bogey 
on the 15th hole and a triple bogey at No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
However, he seemed unruffled about his miscues later in the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a 25-foot putt at the 15th and it didn't break and went past the cup 
three feet," he said. "Then, the ball didn't go into the hole two times. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened at 15 was an accident. I've been putting very well. Under the 
conditions a 72 is still a good round." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros said that he hopes the weather remains the same, with a capricious 
wind puzzling the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a good feeling about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the wind would affect the other players more than him, the 
Spaniard said, "I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
There are other players very much in contention after the top seven. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, who had a 72, is at even par with 144. Curtis Strange, Mark O'Meara 
and Tom Watson are grouped at 145. Jack Nicklaus, a six-time winner of the 
Masters, shot a 74 and is six strokes behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The cut was at 151 and such notable players as defending champion Sandy Lyle 
and 1982 Masters titlist Craig Stadler didn't make it. Lyle had a 76 Friday, 
and Stadler soared to a 79. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was the major topic of conversation: 
</P>
<P>
Said Kite: "It was really, really difficult out there. The greens are really 
fast. The wind is rocking you. The only saving grace is the greens are still 
holding because of the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crenshaw, who shot a 72: "A 72 today is like a 68, or 67 on a normal day." 
</P>
<P>
When someone told Crenshaw that Strange's round of 71 had not included a bogey, 
he exclaimed, "That's off the charts." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reid: "It's like the Navy slogan, 'It's not just a job, it's an 
adventure.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Strange: "It was tougher out there, much tougher than yesterday, windier 
and colder." 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "It's about a two-club wind and the way I had been playing, any 
club I pulled out of the bag was a gamble." 
</P>
<P>
Green's best finish in 10 previous tournaments was a tie for 17th in the A 
&amp; T Pebble Beach Pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was a grim day for most, Trevino managed to have some fun and 
entertain the gallery. On the 12th hole, he pulled about four balls from the 
edge of Rae's Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked like Easter eggs," he said. "I've never left a golf ball on the 
edge of the water. Wouldn't you pick up a dollar bill if you saw it? And golf 
balls cost more." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ken Green is regarded as the maverick of the tour, even though he says that 
sometimes people misunderstand him. In any event, he speaks his mind. Green 
irritated Masters officials here in 1986 when he criticized the greens and said 
that the traditional entrance to the course for the pros, Magnolia Lane, was 
"just another street with trees on it." Green, who shot a 69 Friday, said that 
he had never heard anybody complain about Augusta National previously and, when 
he first came here, he was shocked. "It's a beautiful course, but the greens 
then were so fast you had a better chance on I-20 (a nearby freeway)." He is 
not complaining this year, but he said that a win at Hartford, or Westchester, 
both Eastern courses, would mean more to him than a victory here because he 
would be playing in front of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Green probably holds the tour record for throwing his putter the most times in 
a year. He estimated that he chucked it eight times in 1988, either into lakes, 
or the Pacific Ocean. "I have no sentimental attachment to a putter," he said. 
"When it's good to me, fine, but when it's bad, it has to die." 
</P>
<P>
With Sandy Lyle not making the cut, he became the fourth defending Masters 
champion to bow out after 36 holes. It happened to Jack Nicklaus in 1967, Tommy 
Aaron in 1974 and Seve Ballesteros twice, in 1981 and again in 1984. . . . 
Arnold Palmer, a four-time Masters champion, shot 81-80 for the 36 holes. . . . 
Eric Meeks, the U.S. Amateur champion from Walnut, missed the cut at 162 
(83-79).

DURYEA NAMED DIRECTOR OF OLYMPIC FESTIVAL IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earl Duryea, whose most recent position was president of the Harlem 
Globetrotters, Friday was named executive director of the 1991 U.S. Olympic 
Festival in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, Harry Usher, chairman of the L.A. Festival's board 
of directors, said he believes Duryea, 51, can help Los Angeles "recapture the 
spirit and enthusiasm" of the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
With a proposed budget of $8 1/2-$10 million, in contrast with the $500 million 
of the 1984 Games, and athletes from only the United States, Usher acknowledged 
that the Festival is on a considerably smaller scale than the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But he and Duryea said they believe Los Angeles will support the Festival, 
which is scheduled for July 12-21, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Events associated with the Olympics are unique. They have a certain mystique," 
Duryea said. "There's still an amateur idealism associated with them." 
</P>
<P>
That may be more true of the Festival than the Olympics, which are allowing an 
increasing number of professionals to compete. In many of the 36 sports 
associated with the Festival, competitors are developing athletes. About 3,500 
athletes are expected to participate at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the competition will occur on the UCLA and USC campuses, Usher said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects ticket sales to generate about $4 million. The rest of the 
budget will be financed privately, he said, primarily through corporate 
sponsorships. If there are profits, they will be donated to the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be a deficit," Usher said. "We promise you that." 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Festival will be the 11th. The 1989 Festival is scheduled for July 
21-30 at Oklahoma City. The 1990 Festival has been awarded to Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Duryea has managed several sports arenas, including San Francisco's Cow Palace, 
Salt Lake City's Salt Palace and Long Island's Nassau Coliseum. He also was a 
vice president of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
He said he became interested in the Olympic movement after hearing speeches by 
several Los Angeles Organizing Committee officials, including Usher, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember telling myself that I wish I had been involved in that," Duryea 
said. "If the opportunity ever came up again, it was something I wanted to do. 
Of course, the Festival is not on the same level with the Olympics. But they 
have the same ideal."

PENSKE TEAM BEATS ALL IN PRACTICE, EXCEPT FITTIPALDI IN A PENSKE

Optimism as high as the searing Arizona sun pervades pit row at Phoenix 
International Raceway as 26 drivers prepare for the opening of the Championship 
Auto Racing Teams season for Indy cars here Sunday in the Autoworks 200. 
</P>
<P>
As yet, no one has failed to qualify, no one has crashed, no one has had an 
engine failure. New equipment has not yet failed, and old equipment has been 
upgraded optimistically. 
</P>
<P>
Optimism is better placed, however, in some camps than in others. After all, 
motor racing is a sport in which the rich get richer, and the rest take the 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Penske team, which won it all last year with Danny Sullivan taking the PPG 
driving championship and Rick Mears his third Indianapolis 500, seems poised 
for an even more impressive season, with its Penske chassis powered by 
720-horsepower Ilmor Chevrolet engines. 
</P>
<P>
Car owner Roger Penske and engineer-designer Nigel Bennett have unveiled a new 
model, the PC-18, for Sullivan and Mears, and have sold one as well to Pat 
Patrick's team for driver Emerson Fittipaldi. From early testing, it appears to 
be better than last year's Bennett-designed PC-17, which won six races and 11 
pole positions in 15 races. 
</P>
<P>
Mears, admittedly running under optimum conditions -- cool, the sun going down, 
no wind and fresh tires -- had a practice lap at 172 m.p.h. around the tricky 
Phoenix one-mile oval last month, shockingly quicker than Mario Andretti's 1986 
record of 165.776. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect anything close to that this week, not in this heat," Mears said 
after Friday's practice in which he and Fittipaldi were more than 3 m.p.h. 
faster than anyone else. Fittipaldi's lap of 165.975 unofficially bettered 
Andretti's track record. Mears' hot lap was 165.411. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for Sunday's 200-mile race will be held today, starting at 11:30 
a.m. when the temperature is expected to be above 100 degrees and the track 
slippery. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who has not done as much testing in the PC-18 as Mears and has no 
such numbers, is equally optimistic, however, about defending his championship. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing about winning, it makes you want to win more," Sullivan 
said. "I'd like to win Indy this year and the championship, too. That's my 
objective right now. Sounds like a nice one, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
The most intriguing team here is the tandem of Mario and Michael Andretti, 
father and son teammates for the first time in a pair of Lola-Chevrolets 
campaigned by Paul Newman and Carl Haas. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a perfect setting for an episode of 'Family Feud,' " one 
competitor said, anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
Mario, who has been racing at Phoenix since 1964 and has eight poles and three 
wins to his credit, including last year's Checker 200, has been notorious in 
his insistence on driving for a one-car team. Last year, however, after Michael 
left the Cosworth-powered Kraco team because he wanted a Chevrolet engine, his 
father agreed to accept him as a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Although Al Unser and Al Jr. have competed together in a number of Indy car 
races, they were never teammates. This will be the first time a father and son 
have driven for the same team in CART. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always wanted an entire team's effort focused on my car, and mine 
alone," Mario said. "But I think you'd have to say this is a unique situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it remains to be seen if he and I are still on speaking terms at 
the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Intriguing, too, is the entry of A. J. Foyt, starting his 33rd Indy car season 
with plans to run his own Lola-Cosworth the entire 15-race series. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt is here also as a coach of Tony George, whose family owns Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway. George, grandson of the late Tony Hulman, is driving in today's 
75-mile American Racing Series race in a Buick Wildcat owned by Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony's like one of my own children," Foyt said. "I've known him since he was 
born. He branched off and did some racing with some other people the past 
couple years, but I felt if he really wants to be serious about it, I would 
give him all the help I could." 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Foyt owns the largest Chevy dealership in Texas, but still isn't one 
of the favored few who have the Ilmor Chevy engines that accounted for 14 of 
last year's 15 race wins. 
</P>
<P>
Only Bobby Rahal, with a Judd, broke the Chevrolet monopoly last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Rahal, who won CART championships in 1986 and 1987, has switched, too, from 
Judd to the newly developed short-stroke Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Sullivan, Mears, Fittipaldi and the Andrettis, Chevy engines 
will be used by Al Unser Jr. this week, and by Al Unser and Geoff Brabham at 
Indianapolis and two other races. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have a Chevy, and so would just about every other driver here," 
Rahal said. "But I think we'll close the gap a bit this year. Michael 
(Andretti) showed the short-stroke's potential when he won the (non-points) 
Marlboro Challenge last fall in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most of the cars were being sorted out officially for the first 
time Friday, the pattern followed last year's. The six fastest were Chevies. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Pruett, moving out of the sports car ranks to drive an Indy car, heads a 
group of five rookies here. Pruett, a former Trans-Am and International Motor 
Racing Assn. champion, replaced Rahal in the Truesports Lola-Judd. 
</P>
<P>
The other first-timers are Steve Saleen of Anaheim and three foreign drivers, 
Guido Dacco of Italy, Jean Pierre Frey of Switzerland and Bernard Jourdain, a 
rich Belgian now living in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a new team, with a new driver, a new sponsor, and we bring a new 
enthusiasm to the motorsports arena," said Saleen, 40, a manufacturer of 
custom-built Mustangs who drove in Formula Atlantic races in 1979 and 1980 with 
other young drivers such as Sullivan, Rahal and Brabham. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a team owner and driver is not uncommon, but there are very few of us 
out there. I'm not the only businessman out there. We are all corporate players 
whether we are in the board room of a sponsor or behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the risks involved, being in business these days you have to stay 
ahead of the next guy, and the same applies to the race track. My weekends, I 
just trade bottom lines for the finish lines." 
</P>
<P>
Another newcomer, but as a car owner and not a driver, is Bruce Leven, a 
longtime competitor in the International Motorsports Assn., whose Bayside 
Motorsports team will have Dominic Dobson, the fastest Indy 500 rookie 
qualifier in history, as his driver. Dobson, in a manner of speaking, is a 
rookie here. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has raced go-karts, Formula Fords, Super Vees, Formula Atlantics 
and driven in 15 Indy car races, this is his first racing appearance at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the hometown fans, Tom Sneva is making a comeback of sorts with Vince 
Granatelli's Phoenix-based team. Sneva, the 1983 Indy 500 champion and a 
four-time winner at Phoenix, missed almost the entire 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
He will be at a disadvantage Sunday, however. The Granatelli team is developing 
a turbocharged Buick V-6 stock block engine that should be competitive at Indy, 
where it will be permitted 55 inches of boost. But for all other races, it is 
allowed only 45 inches and historically that has not made it an equal partner 
with Chevy, Cosworth or Judd. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the Phoenix race was looked upon as mostly a prep for Indy, a 
chance to look at the new equipment and experiment a bit with the Speedway in 
mind. No more. The $17-million series, anchored by the $1.5-million PPG 
driver's bonus, has become a significant entity in itself.

<P>
Olympic basketball was opened to professional players Friday by an overwhelming 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
At a special session of FIBA, the international basketball federation, the 
United States cast one of 13 votes against the pro-eligibility plan. Fifty-nine 
countries voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gavitt, the U.S. federation chief, said that much work had to be done 
before National Basketball Assn. players would be eligible to represent the 
United States at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The new eligibility rules, which apply to players in all professional leagues 
worldwide and at all FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, took effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA issued a statement in New York, saying that the league and the players' 
union are working to develop a framework that will allow players to 
participate.

Thomas P. Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and 
his family, was released in Boston on $20,000 bond, after being indicted on 
charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
A five-count indictment, returned in Cincinnati, accused Gioiosa of income tax 
evasion for 1985 and 1986. It also charged that he had conspired with others to 
arrange cocaine deliveries from Florida to Cincinnati between January 1985 and 
January 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa, 31, refused to answer when he was asked if the charges against him 
were an attempt by federal authorities to get at Rose, whose gambling 
activities are under investigation by the baseball commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, commenting on allegations that he was a heavy gambler, said: "I'm glad I 
don't lose as much as people say I lose, and I wish I won as much as people 
think I win. I keep hearing this bull about how I'm a chronic gambler or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"What does a chronic gambler do? He's got to find a place to gamble. Well, I 
got to spring training on Feb. 1, and I went to the dog track three times in 60 
days. The dogs are really your only means of gambling in spring training. So I 
guess that's the end of that theory." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding his association with Gioiosa, Rose said he hadn't seen him in some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where Tommy Gioiosa is. Tommy Gioiosa used to live with me when 
he was about 18 years old. I don't have any idea what he does now," Rose said. 
"Any time that someone that you know is indicted for anything . . . you're 
surprised. And I guess I'm the same. Tommy was always a nice kid to me. And I 
know his mom and dad real well." 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa was a member of the Massasoit Community College baseball team when he 
met Rose in 1978 in Tampa, Fla. He has said he lived at Rose's home in suburban 
Cincinnati for five years until Rose and his first wife, Karolyn, were 
divorced.

NOAH TURNS OUT TO BE NO MATCH FOR MCENROE IN FIRST SINGLES SHOWDOWN

<P>
On the first return of the first match of the United States versus France Davis 
Cup competition Friday, Yannick Noah of France cleanly hit a dipping backhand 
return past a startled John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
Noah would not lead again. 
</P>
<P>
"For about 10 seconds," Noah said. "I was very confident." 
</P>
<P>
One hour 56 minutes later, he had suffered the worst singles defeat of his 
distinguished, 11-year, 38-match Davis Cup career, a 6-3, 6-4, 6-1 loss at the 
San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 World Group Davis Cup play, the team that won the first singles won the 
competition 13 of 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
Only once before had Noah lost a Davis Cup match in straight sets. Yugoslavia's 
Slobodan Zivojinovic defeated him, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never had such a hard time on a Davis Cup court before," Noah said of 
Friday's loss. 
</P>
<P>
But Noah also said he could not remember anybody playing as well against him as 
McEnroe had. "I felt like I was just there to make him feel good and look 
good," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
This was not supposed to be a rout. Noah entered as the 12th-ranked player in 
the world on the latest ATP computer rankings, McEnroe as No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Noah's athleticism, fire and strong early 1989 form were supposed to make this 
an even contest against McEnroe, who hadn't played a tournament match in a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who never lost his serve, broke Noah in the eighth game of the first 
set with a down-the-line backhand winner, then again in the first game of the 
second with another backhand pass. Three more McEnroe service breaks in the 
third were a surprise to nobody. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't serve too well and I didn't move too well," Noah said. "And as the 
match went on, he played better and better." 
</P>
<P>
It was McEnroe's fourth career victory over Noah without a loss. And it was 
achieved mostly because he won 81% of the points in which he put his first 
serve in play. Noah did not have a break point against McEnroe. Noah won only 
14 points against McEnroe's serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Yannick relies a lot on his confidence and starts to break down if you make 
him do things he's not comfortable with," McEnroe said. "Like hitting great 
returns." 
</P>
<P>
Noah, who will turn 29 next month, battles tendinitis in his knees. And despite 
his early-season form, he has lost two five-set matches during March in which 
he won the first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
"My knees were fine," he insisted after the match. 
</P>
<P>
But Noah recently talked publicly about the future he anticipates after tennis. 
He said he planned to sail around the world with his girlfriend, Erica 
Wollweber. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't consider tennis to be "my real life." 
</P>
<P>
More and more he will be forced to consider 1983 the highlight of his career. 
That year he defeated Sweden's Mats Wilander in Paris to win the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Noah was born in Sedan, France, the son of a professional soccer player. But he 
grew up the tribal village of Etudi, a rainforest outpost in Cameroon. There he 
met U.S. tennis player Arthur Ashe, who was in the middle of a good-will tennis 
tour. Ashe tipped French tennis officials to Noah's potential. And the French 
took care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after all these years, his body needs more time between matches. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's match, McEnroe suggested that perhaps Noah hadn't practiced all 
that hard this week. "He probably figured he was match-tough," McEnroe said. 
"But those were different guys he's been playing against, not John McEnroe." 
</P>
<P>
And when McEnroe caught Noah crowding the net at the outset, he backed him off 
with several topspin lobs. It forced Noah to retreat. And it forced a 
flag-waving, near-sellout crowd to begin realizing McEnroe was covering more 
court than Noah. 
</P>
<P>
The most damaging topspin lob came in the eighth game of the first set, just 
before McEnroe's first service break. After that, Noah was confused. McEnroe 
even used the word confused to describe Noah's play in the latter stages. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew," McEnroe said, "that if I could hurt him on his serve, he'd start 
getting down on himself."

LPGA TOURNAMENT AT POWAY;

WITH OKAMOTO OUT, BROWN, DAVIES TIE FOR LEAD

<P>
There are many contenders at the halfway point of the LPGA tour's Red Robin 
Kyocera Inamori tournament at StoneRidge, but defending champion Ayako Okamoto 
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Okamoto is no longer in the tournament. After winning here twice in a 
row, the Japanese veteran bowed out Friday when she added a nine-over-par 80 to 
her first-round 75 and missed the cut by eight strokes. 
</P>
<P>
So while Nancy Brown and Laura Davies moved into a tie for the lead with 
36-hole scores of 136, Okamoto bemoaned the extension of a slump that has 
plagued her all season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really, really frustrating," Okamoto said. "I felt frustrated the whole 
day, all week, every day, every shot." 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto led the tour in 1987 by earning $466,034 and finished sixth last year 
with $300,206, but has won only $12,946 in 1989. This is the second consecutive 
week she has failed to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Both Brown and Davies, who had trailed by one stroke with 69s after the first 
round, shot 67s Friday. Martha Nause's 68 left her a stroke behind at 137, and 
Dale Eggeling and Cindy Rarick dropped from a tie for the lead to a tie for 
fourth with Sue Tonkin at 138. 
</P>
<P>
Deedee Lasker, the other first-round leader, shot a 74 and skidded to a tie for 
18th at 142. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Thomas made the tournament's first hole in one on the 16th.

Mike Donald shot a five-under-par 65 Friday to tie Jim Booros for the lead at 
133 after two rounds of the $200,000 PGA Deposit Guaranty golf tournament.

<P>
Booros, who led after Thursday's opening round at the Hattiesburg Country Club 
course, had two birdies and his first bogey of the tournament for a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Ten Broeck, was third at 134 after a 65, and Rick Fehr was fourth at 135 
after a 65. Six players were tied at 136.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE NEW, MATURE BALLESTEROS IS PUT TO TEST WHEN HE FOUR-PUTTS 
GREEN 
</P>

AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Augusta wind came up, so Seve Ballesteros decided to lay up short with his 
second shot. No way would he go for this 15th green -- maybe even under normal 
conditions. Not from atop this hill. Not on a 500-yard hole. Not with this pond 
in his way, inviting him to come on in, take a dip, get his ball washed. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Gene Sarazen did double-eagle this damn thing by whacking a four-wood 
across the water and holing it, but that was 54 years ago. Old news. 
</P>
<P>
Safely in front of the pond, lying two, Ballesteros punched a nine-iron. In the 
air it looked lovely, but on the ground it spun crazily. The ball squirted 25 
feet from the pin. 
</P>
<P>
Seve sighed. 
</P>
<P>
OK, bad luck, but no big deal. This was only Friday, not Sunday. He would keep 
that world-famous hot blood from spilling. None of those Hispanic histrionics 
of his. After all, he was still three-under for the round, still playing 
splendidly on a windy day in Georgia when hardly anybody in the Masters seemed 
capable of breaking 70. 
</P>
<P>
Only Nick Faldo was ahead of him on the leader board at this point. Lee Trevino 
had momentarily faded. Ballesteros, the Masters champion of 1980 and 1983, the 
British Open champion of last summer, could make this 25-footer for a birdie 
and put himself right at the front of the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
So, he putted. 
</P>
<P>
And putted. 
</P>
<P>
And putted. 
</P>
<P>
And putted. 
</P>
<P>
The first one refused to break, and stopped three feet wide of the cup. The 
second one slid three feet past. The third missed by inches. A four-putt green. 
A seven for Seve. The gallery parted for him with that same combination of fear 
and respect traditionally reserved for Ballesteros, who on given days is likely 
to plow right over somebody, leaving spike marks. 
</P>
<P>
But the new Ballesteros, more mature, recently wed, dare we say mellow -- a 
connection there? -- did his best to shrug the whole thing off. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, the ball would not go into the hole -- two times," he said. 
"I tell you, I try my best. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess everybody has to pay duties at the Masters. I hope I pay mine on the 
15th hole today." 
</P>
<P>
No temper. No tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
Not even one word? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Ballesteros had to admit, "I say: 'You son of a bitch.' " 
</P>
<P>
Grinning. 
</P>
<P>
"In Spanish. Hijo de puta." 
</P>
<P>
Funny round all around for Ballesteros, who finished right where he began: one 
under par for the tournament. He had a 68 in his sights until that 15th hole 
swallowed him whole, but this was one of those days when everybody said bye-bye 
to birdies, a day when Andy Bean and Nick Price and Hal Sutton and Gary Koch 
were as close to 90 as they were to 70. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was a day for laughing off four-putt greens. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe five, six years ago, could have been a disaster," Ballesteros said. 
</P>
<P>
On the course that he calls his absolute favorite, in the country where he so 
seldom plays, Ballesteros always aims to please. He wants to do well at 
Augusta, and usually does. With a little luck, he says, he could have five 
green jackets. Five championships in one decade. He placed second in 1985, left 
his 1986 chances in the 15th-hole pond, and lost a 1987 playoff. 
</P>
<P>
He likes it here, and it likes him. Of course, the locals did not exactly make 
him feel at home at this year's pre-tournament banquets, serving up a variety 
of exotic fare ranging from Scottish haegis to Southern chitlins. One needs 
intestinal fortitude -- pun definitely intended -- to digest either dish. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later what he thought of his meal, the Spaniard proved himself an 
ambassador of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Was free," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supper aside, rarely has Ballesteros had a more challenging day than Friday, 
when the wayward wind made him step away from putts to regain his balance. On 
two holes alone, the 15th and 17th, it took him seven putts to get down. Yet, 
Ballesteros insisted he has never putted better. A tip from his brother Vicente 
has him hunching with his eyes more directly over the ball. 
</P>
<P>
So, putting problems? 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no, no," Ballesteros said. "What happened at 15 was an accident, 
that's all. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with my game. When you play Augusta and don't miss one green 
all day, that means something. I am sure there are not many players here today 
who can say they did not miss one green." 
</P>
<P>
Not many players could say they missed four putts on one green, either. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros didn't go on or go off about it. 
</P>
<P>
He just paid his duties and played through.

PITTSBURGH'S BENTLEY AIMS FOR LEWIS' PREP RECORD

<P>
Twenty-two years ago, Jerry Proctor of Pasadena Muir High School became the 
first high school long jumper to leap more than 26 feet, setting the national 
prep indoor record at 26-2 and the national outdoor record at 26-0 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, Dion Bentley of Pittsburgh's Penn Hills shattered Proctor's indoor 
record with a leap of 26-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at the Arcadia Invitational, Bentley will be taking aim at one of the 
most durable outdoor high school records in the books -- Carl Lewis' 26-8 1/4. 
Lewis set the record in 1979, as a senior at Willingboro High in New Jersey, 
when he finished third in the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
With athletes entered from 14 states, among them New York and Florida, the 
Arcadia Invitational at Arcadia High School, has become the country's premier 
regular-season meet. 
</P>
<P>
The open session will begin at 11:30 a.m. The invitational portion will start 
at 4 p.m. with the discus. The long jump is scheduled at 5:30, and the first 
running event is set for 6:40. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' sprints and relays will feature Hawthorne and Oakland, but the top 
individual sprinter may be Albert Ransom of Denver Montbello. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom is entered in the 100- and 400-meter events, in which he has bests of 
10.43 and 46.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging Ransom in the 100 will be Berry Smith of San Francisco Mission, who 
has run 10.49, and Oakland's Jeff Laynes, who has a best of 10.64. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne is the national leader in the 400 relay at 40.66, and has run 3:16.6 
in the 1,600 relay. Oakland has bests of 41.99 and 3:19.5. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the girls' competition will be the sprints, the jumps and the 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Entered in both the 100- and 200-meter runs are Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio 
Mesa, the 1988 national track and field athlete of the year, with bests of 
11.28 and 23.45; Inger Miller of Muir, who has run 11.59 and 23.59 but beat 
Burnham earlier this season, and Andrea Lee of Milwaukee Riverside, the 
Wisconsin state champion, with bests of 11.92 and 24.02. They are the country's 
best three sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' discus brings together the country's best five throwers. Leading the 
way are Bakersfield juniors Dawn Dumble, with a throw of 170 feet 11 inches, 
and Melissa Weis at 165-4. They are followed by Julie Victor of 
Austintown-Fitch in Youngstown, Ohio, at 159-2, Candy Roberts of Chino Don Lugo 
at 157-9, and Alison Franke of Anaheim Canyon at 154-8. 
</P>
<P>
Dumble and Weis also rank 1-2 in the shotput with bests of 48-5 1/2 and 45-7 
1/2, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the triple jump there are seven entrants with jumps of better than 38-6, led 
by Juliana Yendork of Walnut, who has a best of 40-8, and Leah Kirklin of 
Oklahoma City Marshall (40-5). 
</P>
<P>
The long jump has nine competitors at 18-9 or better and the high jump has 11 
at 5-8 or better, led by Lori Svoboda of Placentia El Dorado, who leaped 5-10 
3/4 last week and ranks second in the nation.

UCLA QUARTERBACK CONTEST LOSES AN ENTRY WHEN BOBBY SAN JOSE DECIDES TO TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And then there were three. Bobby San Jose, expected to compete with Jimmy 
Bonds, Ron Caragher and Bret Johnson in spring drills for the UCLA quarterback 
job vacated by Troy Aikman, is leaving school to pursue his college football 
career elsewhere, the school announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No specific reason was given for San Jose's decision. It's also not known where 
the junior plans to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bruins held their first official spring scrimmage at the Rose 
Bowl Friday. Bonds, a sophomore, completed 5 of 7 for 69 yards, including a 
48-yard touchdown to tight end Charles Arbuckle during the 85-play scrimmage. 
Bonds also threw an interception. Caragher, a senior, completed 4 of 10 for 51 
yards. Johnson, a redshirt freshman, was 6 of 9 for 99 yards.

NCAA OFFICIALS CONSIDER PROP. 42 MODIFICATION;

IDEA TO ALLOW AID TO ATHLETES WHO FAIL TO MEET ACADEMIC STANDARDS IS EXPLORED

Freshmen who fail to meet the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s 
controversial Proposition 42 academic requirements might still receive athletic 
scholarships under an idea the organization's Presidents Commission has decided 
to explore, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to modify Proposition 42 to provide an individual the opportunity 
to receive need-based financial aid, the kind that would be available on the 
same basis to other incoming students," said Ted Tow, a NCAA assistant 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"But the commission reaffirmed its support of the principle of Proposition 42, 
that academic standards for initial eligibility in athletics should be 
strengthened. The commission is concerned, however, that individuals who have 
been considered partial qualifiers should not be deprived of the opportunity to 
attend college because they are precluded from receiving financial aid." 
</P>
<P>
The passage of Proposition 42 at last January's NCAA convention was 
controversial, and led to Georgetown basketball Coach John Thompson boycotting 
several games in protest. Essentially, Proposition 42 -- to take effect in 
August of 1990 -- eliminates the partial qualifier provision of Proposition 48. 
A partial qualifier is one who has an overall 2.0 high school grade-point 
average but fails to meet other Proposition 48 standards, the minimum score on 
college entrance tests or a 2.0 in college preparatory courses. 
</P>
<P>
Partial qualifiers have been able to receive scholarships but were barred from 
playing or practicing as freshmen. Under Proposition 42, they would be denied 
all scholarship aid. Tow said the commission, at its meeting earlier this week 
in Chicago, asked the staff to prepare modifying legislation for the 1990 
convention. The legislation is expected to most directly affect minority 
students who traditionally score lower than other groups on the standardized 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have something for the commission to review at its October meeting," Tow 
said. "If need-based financial assistance were awarded to a recruited prospect, 
it would be counted against a school's financial aid limits. In other words, an 
institution can have only 95 football players on scholarship, and a freshmen 
receiving the need-based aid would count against the scholarship limit." 
</P>
<P>
The commission will not be the only group with legislation regarding 
Proposition 42 on the 1990 agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"The common wisdom is that there could be several proposals, ranging all the 
way from delaying implementation of 42 to rescinding it," Tow said. "That is 
what we hear from the membership." 
</P>
<P>
Tow said the commission also decided to support an effort by Sen. Bill Bradley 
(D-New Jersey) to require schools to disclose their athletes' graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something else we'll be working up for the October meeting, with the 
intention of submitting it to a vote of the membership at the January 
convention," Tow said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to make the information available during the recruiting process. 
The next step is to specify the definitions, the format and the extent of the 
disclose. How widely will it be disclosed? Just to the prospect and his 
parents, or to the general public?"

TORRANCE ASKS COURT TO DECLARE REFINERY A 'PUBLIC NUISANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Torrance, alleging the "potential for a massive disaster" at the 
Mobil Oil Corp. refinery, filed suit Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court 
seeking to have the refinery declared a public nuisance and giving the city 
authority to regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that an uncontrolled release of acutely toxic hydrofluoric 
acid from the refinery could threaten the lives or health of hundreds of 
thousands of South Bay residents. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, in its 40-page complaint, asked the court to declare the facility a 
nuisance, issue an injunction barring Mobil from polluting the air with the 
acid and other toxic chemicals and order the company to operate the refinery 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials did not specify what action the city might take as a result 
of such a court order. Mayor Katy Geissert said the city might force Mobil to 
stop using hydrofluoric acid if the court gives Torrance such authority. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials had not seen the lawsuit late Friday and refused to comment on 
its specific allegations. Spokesman Mark Cohen said the legal action was 
expected and "we will defend ourselves against it." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said he does not underestimate the legal 
resources at Mobil's disposal. "This doesn't scare me. This doesn't scare the 
City Council. We honestly think there is a safety problem," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that they could completely overwhelm us, but we think we 
have a good case and I have a lot of faith in the judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit signals that Torrance does not accept Mobil's repeated assurances 
that the facility is operating safely. It also is designed to protect the city 
from being sued by Mobil for regulating the refinery, or by the public should 
an accident occur, city officials said privately. 
</P>
<P>
It represents the latest step by the City Council to respond to a series of 
explosions, fires and accidents that have claimed three lives and caused more 
than a dozen serious injuries at Mobil since 1987. The suit alleges that there 
are "severe problems with safety conditions and procedures at the refinery." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson suggested that a month ago, Exxon would have argued to Alaskan fishermen 
that a massive oil spill in the pristine waters of the Prince William Sound 
could not occur. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Human Error' Feared 
</P>
<P>
"Yet it happened because of human error," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawsuit contends that a November, 1987, explosion and fire at the 
Mobil refinery was caused by human error. An estimated 100 pounds of 
hydrofluoric acid was released during the explosion, but authorities said none 
escaped the refinery grounds and no one was injured by the release. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for human error exists at the (Mobil) refinery and if one of the 
more devastating mistakes were made, we could have a really serious disaster," 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not your modern refinery," Nelson said. "This is an old refinery 
across the street from people's homes and a quarter-mile from schools. It is 
not in the backwoods of Louisiana or the plains of Midland, Tex." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Are Concerned' 
</P>
<P>
Cohen rejected the lawsuit's contention that Mobil is operating the refinery in 
a "callous and indifferent" manner. "We are concerned about the safety of our 
employees and the safety of the people of Torrance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mobil spokesman noted that the oil company "recently submitted a risk 
management prevention plan to the city of Torrance which shows the risks 
associated with our use of hydrofluoric acid to be insignificant. We plan to 
prove this in court." 
</P>
<P>
But in the lawsuit, Torrance alleges that the risk management plan released by 
Mobil last month contains "glaring deficiencies," including the complete 
omission of a "worst-case scenario" of the life and health impacts of a 
hydrofluoric acid release. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that "if a 1,000-gallon release occurred at the refinery, 
hundreds of thousands of persons could be killed and double that number could 
be severely injured." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cloud Hugs Ground 
</P>
<P>
Industry-sponsored tests conducted in the Nevada desert in 1986 showed that the 
release of 1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid forms a toxic gas cloud that hugs 
the ground and moves with the wind. The tests showed that the gas could be 
lethal to all exposed within five miles and immediately dangerous to the life 
and health of those within a 7 1/2-mile radius. An estimated 29,000 gallons of 
acid is stored at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil refinery Manager Wyman D. Robb, who was named in the complaint, has 
estimated that it could cost $100 million to convert the refinery to use 
sulfuric acid instead of hydrofluoric acid to boost the octane of unleaded 
gasoline. Mobil is the only major Southern California refinery that uses 
hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Robb has said sulfuric acid has its hazards because much greater quantities are 
needed, which means more rail and truck transport. The sulfuric acid process is 
more costly and, unlike hydrofluoric acid, produces toxic wastes, he has said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that a hydrofluoric acid accident at the Mobil facility 
could lead to "a disaster of Bhopal-like proportions." 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people died and tens of thousands of others were injured when a 
different chemical, methyl isocyanate, leaked from a Union Carbide plant in 
Bhopal, India, in December, 1984. Chemical experts say hydrofluoric acid is as 
toxic as methyl isocyanate. 
</P>
<P>
As Torrance officials have learned more about the refinery, council members 
have become concerned that the city could be liable for damages in an accident. 
Geissert said the lawsuit proves the city wants to protect the public. 
</P>
<P>
The suit "puts on the record that we are mightily concerned about the potential 
for a catastrophic event," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiative Campaign 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit caps a week that saw Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker launch an 
initiative campaign to qualify for the city ballot a measure that would 
effectively ban the use of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Council colleagues have denounced Walker's ballot measure as a self-serving 
move to advance the councilman's political career and instead filed the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit retraces the history of 127 incidents at Mobil since December, 
1979, when three people were killed, including a passing motorist, in an 
explosion and fire at a Mobil tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
"The mere frequency of such incidents, many of which are attributable to human 
error, indicates severe problems with safety conditions and procedures at the 
refinery," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that Mobil does not have adequate emergency equipment to 
contain an uncontrollable release and has failed to respond to the city's 
inquiries about emergency preparedness

CRA PUT $500,000 IN BANK THAT HAD BRADLEY ON PAYROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Community Redevelopment Agency had investments exceeding 
$500,000 with Far East National Bank last year while Mayor Tom Bradley served 
as a paid special adviser to the bank, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency is the second department to deposit city funds with 
Far East at a time when Bradley was paid $18,000 in fees to furnish the bank 
with his expertise on business and foreign trade matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley announced last month that he had returned the money to Far East when he 
learned the city treasurer's office had invested $1 million in the bank. When 
he returned the fees, the mayor said he had not known the city had any 
relationship with the bank when he agreed to serve on its advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
He would not comment on the CRA relationship with the bank, Deputy Mayor Mike 
Gage said Friday. Gage added that the mayor told him he was unaware of the 
redevelopment agency's deposits with Far East. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer's deposit was doubled to $2 million in March after Bradley -- who 
said he got a call from Far East's president -- contacted the city treasurer 
and discussed the city's investment policy. Bradley said he called to inquire 
about the investment, not to put pressure on the treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney is investigating Bradley's relationship with two Los Angeles 
financial institutions that either conduct business with the city or have 
received favorable decisions from the City Council and mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director Emeritus of S&amp;L 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who receives a $97,654 annual salary as mayor, is paid $18,000 a year 
by Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Van Nuys as a director emeritus. 
He served as a paid director for Valley Fed from 1978 to 1987, received as much 
as $24,000 a year and has collected nearly $150,000 to represent the thrift's 
interests, records show. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has reported that on at least two occasions Bradley has signed 
land-use ordinances that paved the way for Valley Federal to develop property 
in the city. Bradley said he was unaware that the ordinances benefited Valley 
Federal until he was told by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time Bradley became a special adviser to Far East, a close 
adviser to the mayor approached a nationwide recruiting firm in Los Angeles to 
inquire about available positions on corporate boards that would pay Bradley 
large director fees, according to one source in private industry. 
</P>
<P>
The source, who asked not to be identified, said: "It was mentioned that the 
mayor was anxious to get on some boards. This really surprised me. I can't 
fault the mayor for wanting to supplement his income, but I just don't know of 
anybody who has done this." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is the only big-city mayor who is paid to sit on a private board of 
directors, The Times found in a survey of the nation's 12 largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bradley's key political fund-raisers, investment banker Ira Distenfield, 
said he has urged the mayor to join other boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I have whispered in the mayor's ear over the last couple of years that I would 
certainly encourage him attempting to make some time available to lend what I 
think is his image and his love for business," Distenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Valley Federal, Distenfield said, "I think (Bradley) is able to 
provide them with a pretty authoritative voice of how they can be a good 
corporate citizen and a good provider of housing to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Gage said Friday that the mayor was unaware of the investments in Far East made 
by the redevelopment agency and city treasurer because the president of Far 
East, Henry Hwang, told him the bank had no city investments. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang refused to speak with a reporter in his office Friday. "The mayor has 
issued a statement," Hwang's secretary said. "We will have nothing more to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency's involvement with Far East began in 1982 when the 
city deposited tax revenues from the Chinatown redevelopment project into two 
Asian banks, Cathay Bank and Far East, said Peirre E. Lorenger, the agency's 
deputy administrator for finance and audits. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency's deposits in Far East gradually increased to $840,000 
in 1986 and were at $525,000 a year ago when Bradley became the bank's only 
paid special adviser, according to redevelopment officials. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an unrelated matter, the Fair Political Practices Commission said 
Friday it is investigating campaign donations Bradley received from contractors 
doing business with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. Bradley 
chaired the commission in 1987 and voted several times to award contracts to 
his contributors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$17,000 Returned 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, after inquiries by The Times, the mayor's office acknowledged the 
votes were prohibited by state law and Bradley quickly returned $17,000 in 
contributions. Deputy Mayor Gage said the votes were inadvertent errors. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Bradley has received $13,500 in political contributions from Hwang, 
who told the newspaper Asianweek last month that he plans to run for state 
lieutenant governor on the Republican ticket.

REORGANIZED GRANT NOW OUT OF BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historic U.S. Grant Hotel emerged from 14 months of bankruptcy proceedings 
Friday with its debts reorganized and its owners hopeful that the 283-room 
landmark will at last begin turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Grant Hotel Associates will be under extreme pressure to operate the 
troubled hotel profitably: The partnership will automatically forfeit the hotel 
by foreclosure to lender Home Federal Savings in January, 1991, unless it can 
refinance up to $50 million in debt or find a new buyer in the meantime. Home 
Federal has operating control of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is still losing money and probably is worth less than $35 million, 
according to recent estimates. Developed by the son of the Civil War hero and 
former president, the downtown landmark has struggled with low occupancy rates 
since reopening in December, 1985, after a four-year, $40-million refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel manager Chris Venner, who has been asked by Home Federal to stay on for 
the "immediate future," is accentuating the positive. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence from bankruptcy proceedings "means stability at last for the 
hotel and its future and gives it a chance to prove itself," Venner said. 
Neither Venner nor Home Federal spokeswoman Monica Wiley would say how long 
Venner is likely to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the San Diego Convention Center in late 1989 is critical to the 
hotel's attempt to attract more guests, said attorney Ross Pyle, who 
represented the hotel owners in the bankruptcy. Pyle echoed the hopes of many 
downtown hoteliers who have seen their market soften with the addition of 
hundreds of hotel rooms over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's original redeveloper Christopher Sickels, as well as many city 
officials, hoped the renovated hotel would become a beacon of downtown 
redevelopment. To aid the project, the city arranged a $6-million federal Urban 
Development Action Grant loan, of which $1.2 million came from city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy losses, however, caused the hotel owners -- a 400-member partnership 
headed by Sybedon Corp. of New York that bought the property from Sickels -- to 
default on Home Federal's $32-million second mortgage in January, 1987. The 
partnership fell behind on other debts and filed for protection under Chapter 
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 22 last year, two days before Home Fed 
planned to sell the 79-year-old hotel at a foreclosure auction. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a reorganization plan approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Louise 
Malugen on Feb. 17 and consummated Friday when new liens were recorded on the 
property, the $41.5 million in principal and back interest owed to Home Federal 
Savings was "recast" as a single loan due in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Home Federal also agreed to release a $1.7 million "plan enabling loan" to pay 
certain of the hotel's unsecured creditors as well as $800,000 in back interest 
on the first mortgage owed to the Drown Foundation. The hotel occupies a full 
block bounded by Broadway, 3rd and 4th avenues, and C Street. 
</P>
<P>
Home Fed will also pay out more than $2 million in back taxes owed by the hotel 
over the next two to three months, as well as pay operating losses projected at 
about $1.2 million through January, 1991, or about $50,000 a month, Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster the security of its loan, Home Federal on Friday took title to the 
hotel's parking garage, situated on the north half of the hotel block, a 
property that has been slated for hotel expansion. In exchange, hotel owners 
received a $2-million credit on money owed to Home Fed. To buy the property 
back from Home Fed in 1991, however, the owners must pay $3.2 million for the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
Home Fed's agreement not to foreclose on the hotel -- at least until 1991 -- 
saved the hotel's 400 limited-partner investors from having to repay to the 
government $5.5 million in tax benefits that a change in ownership would have 
triggered, said Michael Aguirre, a San Diego attorney who has filed a 
class-action investor lawsuit against Sickels, Home Federal, Prudential Bache 
and others on behalf of investors. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the agreement, Home Federal was dropped from the investor 
lawsuit that alleged the defendants committed securities violations and 
misrepresented the true value of the hotel. Sickels was also dropped from the 
suit late last year after agreeing to pay $1.2 million in cash to the 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said he is in the midst of court-ordered "settlement negotiations" with 
Prudential-Bache, a securities firm that sold the limited partnership units to 
investors, and Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The UDAG loan, typically made to inner city projects that boost employment, has 
been wiped out by the reorganization. The city has filed a lawsuit against Home 
Federal, alleging that misrepresentations by the S&amp;L entitle the city to 
improved loan seniority. 
</P>
<P>
To enable the reorganization to proceed and, at the same time, remove the 
city's lien from the hotel, Judge Malugen accepted a Home Federal's offer to 
put up a letter of credit covering the city's claim in the event the S&amp;L 
loses the lawsuit.

alleviate Rancho Santa Fe's traffic problems, the elite community's governing 
association has decided to sue its neighboring city for failing to deal with 
the region's increasing traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Santa Fe Assn., which serves as the unincorporated area's governing 
body, decided Thursday to execute their longstanding plans to file a lawsuit 
against the city of Encinitas, said Gene Freeland, an association board member. 
</P>
<P>
The association had been mounting a futile campaign to persuade Encinitas to 
include proposed county highway 680 in its General Plan, which was adopted 
March 29. The legal action is a direct result of Encinitas' decision to abandon 
the highway, which would have helped alleviate traffic congestion in Rancho 
Santa Fe, Freeland said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Every Effort 
</P>
<P>
"We made every effort through discussion and by correspondence to have 
Encinitas reconsider," Freeland said. "But, if they refused, we were prepared 
to begin litigation. Encinitas has declined to address our concern." 
</P>
<P>
"The basic thrust of the litigation is a result of the removal of highway 680," 
he said. "The Encinitas General Plan (without the highway) fails to consider 
what kind of environmental impact it will have on Rancho Santa Fe and the 
region." The lawsuit will be filed by the end of the month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a city's general plan -- a blueprint for land use and future 
growth -- must take into account its impact on surrounding communities and 
provide solutions to mitigate that impact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
East-West Link 
</P>
<P>
The proposed four-lane highway, which would cross Escondido Creek and link 
Interstate 15 and Leucadia Boulevard, was abandoned after concerned neighbors 
said it would leave an ugly scar through residential areas of Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas council members also said other road expansions included in the 
General Plan would eliminate the need for highway 680. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rancho Santa Fe Assn. had hoped the highway proposal would remain 
intact, because its creation would divert traffic away from the rural 
community's winding, two lane roads. 
</P>
<P>
"They've threatened to sue us for the last several months," said Encinitas City 
Atty. Roger Krauel. "But, so far, we haven't received any lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The city, the staff and the council made every effort to address their 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines said the city has done more than its 
share to address regional traffic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done our job," Gaines said. "We spent 2 1/2 years developing our 
General Plan and paid particular attention to traffic. Now, if the Ranch feels 
that we haven't done that, well then, that's their choice (to sue us). We will 
address that at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made that decision (not to include route 680) based on evidence that 
the road was not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Santa Fe Assn., however, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Encinitas has some creative ways of looking at traffic volumes," said Walt 
Ekard, the association's general manager. "The bottom line is that we have a 
problem with their analysis." 
</P>
<P>
"The deletion of highway 680 is a tremendous concern to us," Ekard said. "What 
that means is that there will be significant traffic increase on Ranch roads, 
that quite simply, are not designed for and cannot handle such traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Although highway 680 was discarded, Gaines said the newly adopted General Plan 
calls for adding roads and widening others. 
</P>
<P>
Plans include the construction of a direct link between Leucadia Boulevard and 
El Camino Real, and the addition of lanes to Manchester Avenue, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
"The link between Leucadia and El Camino Real was bitterly opposed (by 
residents), and it was a very difficult decision for us," Gaines said. "But we 
did it as part of our responsibility to accommodate future growth." 
</P>
<P>
Countering the association's lawsuit, Gaines said Rancho Santa Fe has done 
little to help solve traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ranch has these two-way roads, but they haven't tried to add any lanes or 
make plans to augment their roads," Gaines said. "Many of us do not like the 
idea that we are growing rapidly, but we all have to take some share of that 
burden. The Ranch is only willing to take a very small share."

BOY, 9, SUSPENDED FOR TAKING GUN TO CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 9-year-old third grader familiar with firearms was suspended from his Poway 
elementary school for two days because he took an unloaded handgun onto campus, 
authorities reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The child took the gun off his grandfather's dresser, put it in his lunch sack 
and took it to school Thursday, where it was seen by other students during the 
lunch period, said Fred Van Houten, principal of Midland Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The child had a bullet in his pocket that would not fit the gun, and the gun 
itself was not loaded, Van Houten said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were called to the scene and talked to the youngster, but no 
arrest was made and no crime report taken, said Sheriff's Department spokesman 
Al Bates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Released to Grandparents 
</P>
<P>
The child was released to the custody of his grandparents, who are his legal 
guardians. 
</P>
<P>
Van Houten on Friday talked to the school's students, classroom by classroom, 
to clarify the incident, which he said had been wrongly characterized by rumor 
and exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reports circulating the campus were that the child displayed the gun 
while trying to get another student to turn over some of his collector toys. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents called school officials Thursday and Friday because they were 
concerned about the incident, but apparently no children were kept out of 
school Friday because of it, Van Houten said. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the gun never left the child's lunch sack, although the mother 
of another child, who asked not to be identified, said her son was the one who 
first noticed the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked, 'Is that a squirt gun?' And the other boy said, 'No, it's a gun.' He 
took it out of his sack, showed my son, and put it back in his sack." 
</P>
<P>
Students then reported the weapon to the school office, and the youngster was 
brought in. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid knows his guns," Van Houten said Friday. "His grandpa takes him 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rarely Gets in Trouble' 
</P>
<P>
Van Houten said the boy "rarely" gets in trouble on campus, but apparently took 
the weapon to the school because "he was looking for attention from adults." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities downplayed the incident. "I think more publicity 
will feed overreaction," said sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Bob Takeshta. "No report 
was taken. The school is handling the incident." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bates: "No one was in danger at any time, and no threats were made. It's 
just a show-and-tell type thing a lot of times." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fickel, director of pupil services for the Poway Unified School District, 
said a student who takes a loaded firearm on campus would face expulsion and 
possession of an unloaded gun could bring about expulsion as well. 
</P>
<P>
Among the criteria for discipline, Fickel said, is the student's intent, and 
that incidents on elementary school campuses are typically handled by the 
school principal "based on the children not having an understanding of the 
total significance of what harm they could create."

$21.75-MILLION JURY AWARD TO HUDSON'S LOVER MAY BE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge said Friday that he may reduce the $21.75 
million a jury recently awarded Marc Christian, Rock Hudson's former lover, by 
at least $4.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Hudson's estate and for the late actor's secretary, Mark Miller, 
had requested a new trial in the case, calling the award excessive. They also 
submitted evidence of alleged juror misconduct and a sworn statement from an 
Orange County man who claimed that Christian had sex with him six weeks after 
Hudson's death from AIDS in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Although Judge Bruce R. Geernaert said he would not issue a final decision on 
the attorneys' motions until April 21, he did say he planned to reduce the 
punitive damages against Miller from $7.25 million to $3 million or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graphic Testimony 
</P>
<P>
During the five-week trial that ended in February, Christian, 31, said in often 
graphic testimony that he continued to have sex with Hudson for eight months 
after the actor was diagnosed with AIDS. He said that he was never told Hudson 
had contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome and claimed that his 
unwitting exposure to the fatal virus had caused him severe emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of seven women and five men awarded Christian $14.5 million in 
compensatory damages, deciding that Hudson had conspired with Miller to conceal 
his illness from Christian. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded the exemplary and punitive damages against Miller to punish 
him for his "despicable conduct" in helping Hudson to hide his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Geernaert said he would also reduce the compensatory damages, although he had 
not yet decided the amount of the reduction. But the judge added that he 
believed that both the jury's verdict and a sizable award were justified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Fear of Death' 
</P>
<P>
"The fear of AIDS suffered by the plaintiff (Christian) was obviously an 
extremely intense fear," the judge said. "The fear of AIDS is in reality a fear 
of death, and it is a fear of a miserable, agonizing death." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Hudson's estate attempted to discredit Christian's testimony 
Friday by submitting a sworn statement from Gunther Albert Fraulob, a Laguna 
Niguel physical trainer, who claimed to have had sex with Christian after 
Hudson's death. 
</P>
<P>
Geernaert said, however, the new evidence would not have affected the outcome 
of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also dismissed as "not credible" statements by three jurors that were 
submitted by defense attorneys as evidence of juror misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statements, one juror attended the funeral of a friend who had 
died of AIDS and allegedly shared her experiences with her fellow jurors. 
Another juror allegedly confided that she was prejudiced against "rich people." 
</P>
<P>
Geernaert said he believed that their statements were influenced by the "almost 
hysterical response in the media immediately after the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused Comment 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Miller and Hudson's estate refused comment on the judge's 
statements. But Christian's attorney, Harold Rhoden, said his client would now 
be willing to accept as little as $10 million in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden told the jury in February that a high award would "send a message" that 
people with AIDS have a duty to inform their sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's excessive, we admit that," Rhoden said Friday of the jury's award. "But 
as long as it's in the millions, I think the message is there."

MENTAL CLINIC CLOSED BY COUNTY; SAFETY FEARS, NOT ECONOMICS, CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing safety problems, not economic necessity, Los Angeles County officials 
Friday shut down the first of three mental health clinics that they have 
targeted for closure. 
</P>
<P>
As the Wilmington Mental Health Center shut its doors to clients, lawyers 
representing its mentally ill patients petitioned the state Supreme Court to 
block the clinic's closing. 
</P>
<P>
The county is struggling to keep its mental health system afloat in the face of 
a budget crunch, and last August proposed closing some of its 28 outpatient 
clinics to save money. The closings have been delayed several times as a legal 
challenge on behalf of the patients moves through the state court system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Third Time' 
</P>
<P>
"We've been living with this now for a year," complained Paul Schettler, 
director of the Wilmington clinic. "This is the third time that Wilmington has 
had a closure date." 
</P>
<P>
Although the mood at the clinic was somber Friday, it was busier than usual as 
patients who had heard it was about to close rushed in for last-minute 
appointments. They were treated until the regular 5 p.m. closing time, despite 
a sign that declared in bold print: "Wilmington Mental Health Center is 
closed." 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court allows the clinic to remain closed, the staff will be 
transferred to a county clinic in San Pedro and its patients referred to that 
clinic and others nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chronically Ill 
</P>
<P>
But staff members at the Wilmington clinic said their patients -- some of them 
homeless, most of them severely and chronically mentally ill -- may not have 
the money, the transportation or the psychological stamina to survive the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they make it over to San Pedro, they just won't get help," mental 
health counselor Mary Ewing said. "Maybe they'll be out on the street or taken 
in by the police or put in an emergency room. Or maybe they'll be put in jail. 
That's the kind of thing that happens when you close a clinic." 
</P>
<P>
Patient Christina Martinez, who said she suffers from a disorder similar to 
schizophrenia, said Friday that she is afraid to go to San Pedro by herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry the most that I'll lose my psychiatrist," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a press conference, she broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
In briefs filed Friday with the state Supreme Court, the patients' lawyers 
claim that closing the Wilmington center violates a Supreme Court order that 
allows county clinics to remain open until the court can review the patients' 
suit. A ruling is not expected until next week, a court spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff of Three 
</P>
<P>
But county lawyers argue that the ruling does not apply if they close the 
clinics for reasons that are not financial, such as a lack of security. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilmington clinic is in a county building in a low-income, primarily Latino 
community. The smallest of the county's clinics, it serves 123 patients. It has 
just three full-time staff members -- too few to provide a safe work 
environment, according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the safety of county mental health workers became acute in 
February, when Robbyn Panitch, a 36-year-old mental health counselor at a 
county clinic in Santa Monica, was stabbed to death in her office by a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Dowling, the county's chief deputy mental health director, linked the 
Panitch death to the Wilmington closure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Move 
</P>
<P>
"It's not safe, it's not secure and we're not going to take a chance in an 
obvious situation like Wilmington of exposing our employees to any potential 
danger," he said. "I do not want on my conscience a repeat of the tragedy that 
we had at Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
Replied Jim Carroll, the San Fernando Valley legal aid lawyer who is fighting 
the clinic closures on behalf of indigent patients: "They're using the tragedy 
of Robbyn Panitch to try to accomplish what they want to do, which is to close 
the clinics. That's what this boils down to." 
</P>
<P>
The county initially announced plans to close eight clinics but scaled back to 
three after the Supreme Court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wilmington, the Coastal Community Mental Health Center in Carson 
and East San Fernando Valley Mental Health Services Center in North Hollywood 
are on the list, but Dowling said no decision has been made as to when they 
would close. 
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to examine whether we can legally proceed with that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference outside the Wilmington center Friday, officials from 
county employee unions charged that officials are using the Wilmington closure 
as a test case to see if they can also close the other two clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Said Edith Pollach, president of the Assn. of Psychiatric Social Workers of Los 
Angeles County: "They're just using this as a trial balloon to start the 
closures and see if they can get away with this without court permission."

CAVAZOS CALLS FOR CURING U.S. 'EDUCATION DEFICIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos said Friday during a visit to Los 
Angeles that the nation will not solve its budget and trade deficits until it 
addresses its "education deficit." 
</P>
<P>
But Cavazos told an audience of about 600 at UCLA that he does "not sense a 
national commitment to improve education" and said public interest in the 
problem must be raised. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not develop solutions to the budget deficit and the trade deficit 
until we solve the education deficit," Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrendous Dropout Rates' 
</P>
<P>
He cited falling test scores and "horrendous dropout rates" as reasons why 27 
million, or 13%, of all Americans are illiterate and another 40 million are 
"functionally illiterate." 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, America ranks near the bottom in math and other science 
scores when compared with its industrial trading partners, Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not underestimate the gravity of the problems we face," he said. "It 
is not written in the stars that the United States of America will always be a 
world leader or even that we will survive as a free nation." 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, who delivered the keynote address at a celebration marking UCLA's 
$370-million, six-year fund-raising drive, said it behooves the public sector 
to increase its contributions to public universities. 
</P>
<P>
"In supporting higher education at the state level, they recognize that in an 
increasingly competitive world market, education will either be the greatest 
asset of American business or its greatest liability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already businesses are training or educating about two-thirds as many people as 
are institutions of high learning, Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 26% high school dropout rate, including 45% of all Hispanics and 
28% of blacks, has resulted in a "tremendous loss of human potential," Cavazos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st Latino in Cabinet 
</P>
<P>
The first Latino to hold a White House Cabinet post, Cavazos called on 
universities to recruit more minority students. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is a special need for minority teachers, noting that 30% of the 
students in the nation are minorities but only 13% of teachers are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, former president of Texas Tech University, was awarded the UCLA Medal, 
the university's highest honor, for his achievements in education.

MAJOR FIRMS BACKING POLICE, LIBRARY BOND MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big business interests are giving heavily to campaigns for two bond measures on 
Tuesday's municipal ballot, campaign finance records show. 
</P>
<P>
The measures are Proposition 1, which would raise $53.4 million to repair and 
expand libraries, and Proposition 2, which would provide $176 million to 
upgrade Police Department facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign managers for the bond measures said that most of their funds have been 
raised from large corporations, some with interests in downtown development. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Reed, chairman of Citizens for a Safer Los Angeles, the Proposition 2 
campaign committee, said he was able to raise $325,000 with telephone calls to 
fewer than 35 area corporations. "I didn't get one turndown," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"A safer Los Angeles is good for business," said Bob Lavoie, campaign manager 
of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 2 would allow the city to build two new police stations and a new 
training facility and to modernize or replace all of the existing stations. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the large donations are being made in the closing days of the campaign, 
according to campaign finance records on file at the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Among the big corporate sponsors of the campaign are Arco, $25,000; Times 
Mirror Co., $15,000; Pacific Telesis Group, $10,000; Occidental Petroleum 
Corp., $2,500, and Southern California Edison Co., $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The library measure is being supported in large part by real estate developers 
and businesses with an interest in the downtown library office tower project -- 
even though no funds from the bond measure will be used in that project. Branch 
libraries would be the sole beneficiaries of Proposition 1. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Steele, co-manager of the Yes on L.A. Libraries campaign, said the 
developers and many of the tenants have taken an interest in the library as a 
result of their association with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Development firm Maguire Thomas Partners, which is rebuilding the downtown 
library under separate funding, was one of the big contributors to the library 
bonds campaign, giving $5,000. Other contributors include the law firm of 
O'Melveny &amp; Myers, $7,500; Shapel Industries, $2,500, and KDG Architecture 
and Planning, $1,250. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the campaign has raised $60,000.

INTERFAITH TV NETWORK EXPANDS ITS PROGRAMMING, INCLUDES SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An interfaith television network, which started offering cable companies an 
alternative to evangelical-fundamentalist programming last September, expanded 
to a fuller schedule this week amid other signs of growth. 
</P>
<P>
VISN, an acronym for Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, became available for 
the first time this week in the Greater Los Angeles area -- through cable 
franchises in the eastern San Fernando Valley and southern Orange County. It 
also is seen in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
And signaling strong Roman Catholic interest in the nationwide venture, Ed 
Warren, a former syndication programming executive with Viacom and Columbia 
Pictures Television, was hired as a key decision-maker on which Catholic shows 
will be selected and developed for VISN. Warren started work in Los Angeles 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widely Representative 
</P>
<P>
The coalition of 21 faith groups is counting on its broadly representative 
support and resources -- from Protestant, Catholic, Mormon and Jewish TV 
production units -- to be an inviting choice for cable operators fed up with 
heavy-handed TV preachers. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't hurt that VISN also has guidelines against proselytizing, 
criticizing other religions and soliciting donations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are at a point where they won't sit still for a half hour of 
appeals for money," said Jeff Weber, programming vice president for the 
nonprofit organization based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Weber described the current 15 1/2 hours of weekday programming (up from 5 
hours) and 18 hours of weekend shows (up from 12 hours) as "a rich mix of 
entertainment, music, drama, worship and public affairs" for people "interested 
in mainstream religious and values-oriented telecasting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Setbacks Expected 
</P>
<P>
"All signs are very positive that we are going to be here for the long haul," 
Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
He doubted that VISN would face the kind of setbacks suffered by a 5-year-old 
satellite television network run by the Southern Baptists, the nation's largest 
Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Baptist Radio and Television Commission, which at one point spent 
$600,000 more on fund-raising efforts than it received, recently has been 
trying to sell ACTS (American Christian Television System), which is $8 million 
in debt. But a group of San Antonio investors failed last month to meet 
financial requirements, prompting ACTS to cut its Fort Worth-based staff by 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has some programs produced by other denominations, ACTS has a 
largely Southern Baptist-oriented fare, including two hours of live call-in 
counseling five days a week. It currently has a 24-hour schedule and its 
programs can be seen in 9 million households, said Dick McCartney, ACTS 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Operation 
</P>
<P>
VISN may yet encounter difficulties, McCartney said. "Given the cost of 
providing 24 hours service and the necessary people and promotion, it will be 
an awfully uphill battle to make it and keep cable companies interested," he 
said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
However, VISN's Weber said, "We are gaining support within the cable industry 
because the companies understand that we are broadly representative." 
</P>
<P>
Another important difference is that VISN is selling its service to companies 
for 3 cents per subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
"For religious programming that is absolutely novel," said Bill Airy of 
Albuquerque, N.M., VISN director of affiliate relations. ACTS offers its 
programs free and some networks, such as Trinity Broadcasting Network, based in 
Tustin, pay cable companies to carry the programs, Airy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9 Million by December 
</P>
<P>
According to an internal projection, VISN officials expect to be available in 
3.5 million households this month and in 9 million by December -- equal to 
ACTS' present total. 
</P>
<P>
Dimension Cable, a southern Orange County cable operator and a subsidiary of 
Times Mirror Co., added VISN this week to the same channel that had been used 
exclusively by TBN. Dimension, which has 100,000 customers, made the move 
despite its survey of 450 subscribers indicating that if programming were 
added, they were the least interested in religious programs of any kind, 
according to a company official. 
</P>
<P>
VISN likewise began Monday for 50,000 customers of United Cable in eastern San 
Fernando Valley, but it will share a channel with Prime Ticket, according to 
Bill Cullen, president. VISN, which begins at 7:30 a.m. (PDT) on weekdays and 5 
a.m. (PDT) on Saturday and Sunday, yields to Prime Ticket in the evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Subjects 
</P>
<P>
The programming includes "All in Good Faith," a British comedy series about an 
Anglican vicar who moves his family to a demanding urban parish; "The Long 
Search," a Time/Life documentary that explores various faiths; "Hard 
Decisions," an ecumenically produced series examining business, medical and 
legal ethical questions; "Faces on Faith," interviews with religious figures 
such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Daniel Berrigan and Harvey Cox; 
"magazine"-format shows produced by the United Methodist Church, the 
Seventh-day Adventists and the Council of Jewish Federations, and old movies 
accompanied by discussions of issues they raise. 
</P>
<P>
Two syndicated religious dramas already seen on broadcast channels -- the 
Paulist Productions' "Insight" and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's "This 
Is the Life" -- also show up on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catholic Links 
</P>
<P>
VISN appeared to be spurned last June by the U.S. Catholic Bishops, who voted 
to channel their officially sponsored programs exclusively to Mother Angelica's 
independent Eternal Word Television Network based in Birmingham, Ala. In doing 
so, the bishops voted down a proposal to negotiate for participation in VISN. 
</P>
<P>
However, the leading producers of Catholic TV programs formed an independent 
group to offer their services to VISN. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington have privately assured 
us they are in favor of our effort," said Father Anthony Scannell, president of 
the Franciscan Communications Center in Los Angeles and a board member of 
Catholic VISN Producers. Scannell said the newly formed group may produce 
investigative and daring "frontier" programs that they would not otherwise be 
able to do if they were under the direction of the bishops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting Veteran 
</P>
<P>
To select the best of existing Catholic productions and develop new shows, the 
producers group enlisted broadcasting veteran Warren, 63, a member of St. 
Jude's parish in Westlake Village who studied in Catholic colleges and once 
headed the communications department at St. Mary's College at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the job because (VISN's) need coincides with my own personal philosophy 
and my desire to use my experience," Warren said in his freshly painted, but 
decidedly unpretentious office at the Franciscan center in Los Angeles' garment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said he was interested in more than religious programs. "I'd like to see 
human interest programs and ways to show how Catholics have contributed to 
history and culture as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After heading programming departments at major stations and network offices in 
New York, including six years with ABC, Warren directed TV syndication for 
Viacom and Columbia until the mid-1980s when he went into consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
Scannell, in praising Warren, said: "I'm not aware of anyone else in VISN who 
has someone of this caliber in charge of programming." 
</P>
<P>
Of VISN, Scannell said: "It's the most hopeful thing on the horizon because of 
the diminishing free time for religious programs on broadcast stations and the 
rising costs of buying time."

L.A. EPISCOPAL BISHOP TO BE CHAIRMAN; 
</P>
<P>
BORSCH HELPS SET UP PUBLISHING HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing a continuing decline in works of "serious theology," the scholarly new 
Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles has spearheaded the formation of a publishing 
house linked with SCM Press Ltd., Britain's leading theological publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Frederick Borsch, a New Testament scholar who has written or edited 12 
books, will serve as the chairman of Trinity Press International, which was 
given a start by a $1.5-million matching grant from Trinity Episcopal Church in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Books a Year 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans call for 50 books per year, beginning with a list of 21 titles to 
be published in the fall by the British publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the venture was only recently made, but the project was 
organized by Borsch last year during the time between his January election as 
bishop of the Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese and his June installation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crazy thing for me to do," said Borsch, citing the complications of 
moving from Princeton University to Los Angeles and preparing to lead the 
diocese of 152 churches in six counties. 
</P>
<P>
An accumulation of events spurred him to act anyway, he said. Borsch said he 
was "very upset" when the Episcopal Church sold its publishing house, Seabury, 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, some houses were reorganized as a result of denominational mergers. 
Westminster and John Knox -- Presbyterian houses -- are being combined, as are 
the Augsburg and Fortress presses within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Fortress Press, formerly based in Philadelphia and linked with the relatively 
liberal Lutheran Church in America, moved to Minneapolis early this year to 
consolidate with Augsburg, whose works are mostly designed for church 
curriculums. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Rast resigned late last year as senior editor of Fortress to become 
publisher and director of Trinity Press International's U.S. offices in 
Philadelphia. Rast claimed in an interview with The Lutheran magazine that 
scholarly books "do not have a favored status" in the consolidated publishing 
house in Minneapolis. A spokesman for Augsburg Fortress replied that no one 
line of books should have a favored position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Testament Scholars 
</P>
<P>
Trinity Press plans to publish works by New Testament scholars E. P. Sanders 
and Helmut Koester, Jewish history specialist Marc Saperstine, German 
theologian Jurgen Moltmann and Anglican theologian John Macquarrie. 
</P>
<P>
SCM has an impressive backlist of authors such as Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, 
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Edward Schillebeeckx and Karl Rahner. The house has also 
published the once-controversial best-sellers "Honest to God" by John A. T. 
Robinson and "The Myth of God Incarnate," edited by John Hick. 
</P>
<P>
Although begun with Episcopal and Anglican church help, Borsch described the 
new press as "free of ecclesiastical control yet sympathetic and supportive of 
denominational theology and character." 
</P>
<P>
Borsch said publishers with direct denominational ties tend to publish fewer 
provocative religious books or biblical studies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provocative Book Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the face of internal criticism, the United Methodist-related 
Abingdon Press dropped a provocative book, "Living in Sin?" by liberal 
Episcopal Bishop John Spong. However, amid heightened public attention to the 
book, Harper &amp; Row quickly picked it up and published in last May. 
</P>
<P>
If Spong were to write a book debunking the fundamentalist view of the Bible as 
error-free (the purpose of a committee he recently convened in his Diocese of 
Newark), would Trinity Press International consider publishing it? 
</P>
<P>
"We might not be radical enough for him, but, yes, we might," Borsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Borsch said he has a couple more books he would like to write, he does 
not know yet when he will find time to do them.

GROUP PROTESTS DENIAL OF PROMOTION TO FEMINIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 60 theologians and religious scholars have protested the decision of 
Boston College to deny feminist theologian Mary Daly a promotion from associate 
professor to full professor for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Daly, 60, has four degrees from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and 
graduate degrees from Catholic University of America and St. Mary's College in 
South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966 she became the first woman to join the theology faculty at Jesuit-run 
Boston College. Two years later she published her most influential work, "The 
Church and the Second Sex," in which she declared that Catholic women "are 
conditioned to believe that they have an irremediably inferior nature." 
</P>
<P>
The next year the college told her they would be firing her, but following 
protests from students and other faculty the university changed its mind and 
granted her tenure. Her first bid for full professorship was denied without 
explanation in 1975, and the university recently informed her that it has 
denied her second petition for such status, which brings with it a greater 
salary and increased academic prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Father Robert Barth, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, told Daly that 
the promotion committee denied her second request because of her lack of 
articles in scholarly journals, "the questionable scholarliness of recent 
books" she has written and her failure to take part in committee work. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of the American Academy of Religion, 300 scholars signed a 
petition that urged "the long overdue promotion of Mary Daly to full 
professor." Her cause has also been taken up on campus by a group of students 
and some staff who tried unsuccessfully to stage a sit-in at the residence of 
Father J. Donald Monan, president of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Among the theologians who have urged that Daly be given tenure are David Tracy, 
distinguished service professor of the University of Chicago Divinity School, 
who called her "one of those rare theologians whose work all theologians need 
to read and respond critically to"; Harvey Cox of the Harvard Divinity School, 
who said, "It is hard to imagine where the whole field of religious and 
theological studies would be today were it not for the contributions she has 
made"; and Margaret R. Miles of Harvard Divinity School, who described her as 
"the most articulate and influential critic of religion, philosophy and society 
of any person of our time." 
</P>
<P>
Daly has described the second refusal of her application for promotion as an 
example of "extreme bigotry and parochialness, as well as absolute hypocrisy 
about academic freedom."

ARCHDIOCESE PAYS $358,000 TO FAMILIES IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Roman Catholic archdiocese has agreed to pay $358,000 to the families of 
three former altar boys who allegedly were sexually molested by a British 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
The church authorities returned Father Anton Mowat to England for treatment 
instead of reporting him to police, the Atlanta Constitution reported this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Mowat fled a treatment center there and currently is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Mowat, who spent two years as associate pastor of Corpus Christi Catholic 
Church in suburban Stone Mountain, was charged last year with molesting four 
boys, ages 12 to 14, during the 12-month period ending in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The out-of-court civil settlement involves three of the four boys. 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese agreed to pay $30,000 each to the three parents or guardians, 
with a total of about $107,000 in other compensation plus $161,000 in attorneys 
fees going to two of the guardians, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
The church also agreed to undisclosed "deferred payments" to two of the victims 
after they reach the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
Parents reported the molestations to the archdiocese, assuming that the church 
would contact authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Sent back to England, Mowat vanished from a Catholic center where priests are 
treated for various psychological or behavioral problems. Church officials in 
England reportedly were unaware of the indictment.

Hailing its war victories against Iran, Iraq put domestically produced missiles 
on show Friday at a festival in this northern city. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-to-ground missiles, with a range of 400 miles to 530 miles, are 
similar to those used to bombard Tehran before a U.N.-brokered cease-fire last 
August ended eight years of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the missiles, named Al Hussein and Al Abbas after the grandsons 
of the Prophet Mohammed, the Military Industries Ministry also displayed a tank 
said to have been manufactured completely in Iraq.

RATS ACT LIKE LAMBS FOR STUDENT ANIMAL TRAINERS AT ANNUAL REVUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coaxed by kisses and cat food, a baker's dozen of rodents proved Friday that 
even rats can be nice guys once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 rats cooperated with their student handlers at Moorpark College by 
popping out of cakes, lifting weights or bowling on command -- although a few 
reluctant ones seemed determined to live down to their name. 
</P>
<P>
The annual demonstration, known as the Rat Revue, is designed to give novices 
in the college's Exotic Animal Training and Management Program a chance to 
showcase their fledgling training skills. Many of the students will eventually 
become animal handlers and trainers for movies, television shows, zoos and 
circuses, said Gary Wilson, who teaches in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson chose the 13 best students from a beginning animal behavior class of 
about 40 to put on the show. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly does it take to teach a rat to obey you and pop out of a cake like 
a stripper, as Karen Strauch's rat Lennie did. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to take your rat everywhere for about a month to get him used to 
you," Wilson told about 50 people who watched the revue. "A few students got 
thrown out of restaurants because of that." 
</P>
<P>
To better display their prodigies' talents, the students built elaborate sets 
of plywood and cardboard that incorporated tiny tunnels, ladders and swimming 
pools in a variety of settings -- such as the prison island of Alcatraz, a 
gymnasium, a bowling alley and a beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Cordes, 21, of Huntington Beach waved her hands frantically as Surfer 
Steve, her female rat, lingered too long in the model surf shop that she had 
built as part of her beach set. "What can I say?" Cordes said. "My rat likes to 
shop, just like I do." 
</P>
<P>
But afterward, when Surfer Steve had redeemed herself by scampering up a ladder 
in exchange for cat food, Cordes rejoiced. 
</P>
<P>
She said she took the class a second time because the first time she took it, 
her rat "did absolutely nothing, so I gave him away. This one I'll keep."

WOMAN WITH CHILDREN HIT BY STRAY BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman passer-by pushing a baby stroller was accidentally shot in the arm 
Friday by suspected gang members who opened fire on a passing car in Pacoima, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whom police did not identify, was in stable condition at a Pacoima 
hospital, Lt. Gary Williams said. A stray bullet hit the woman as she was 
walking along the 12700 block of Van Nuys Boulevard accompanied by a 3-year-old 
child and a 1-year-old baby in a stroller, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a loaded Uzi semiautomatic carbine from the scene, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two young men were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, 
Williams said. He did not identify them because authorities had not determined 
whether they are juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
The young men are suspected of being involved in other shootings in the area 
last week, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he did not know whether gang members were in the car that was 
fired at. There was no description of the car or its passengers. Police were 
continuing to investigate the shooting.

PARTNERSHIP TO BUY GARDENA POKER CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Horseshoe Club, one of Gardena's three poker clubs, is being sold to a 
partnership headed by the former president of the Commerce Casino, who said he 
plans to close the club temporarily for extensive remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Stern, former president of a group of investor-owners at the Commerce 
Casino, is a general partner of the newly formed limited partnership that has 
made an agreement to purchase the 42-year-old club. Escrow on the property is 
scheduled to close in mid-April, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said the new owners will spend $4 million on the purchase, which includes 
the building and three-acre site at Vermont and Rosecrans avenues. They will 
invest another $4 million to modernize the club, which he described as 
"well-worn." 
</P>
<P>
Although the group is looking for additional investors, Stern said the 
partnership has sufficient financing to complete the purchase and needs only 
city and state approval of its applications for gaming licenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditional Approval 
</P>
<P>
Mike Broderick, manager of the gaming registration program in the state 
attorney general's office in Sacramento, said Stern and a partner, Leonard 
Baum, have already received conditional approval for a state license to operate 
the Horseshoe Club. 
</P>
<P>
Conditional approval is given when applicants have submitted a complete 
application and passed a cursory background check, Broderick said. Applicants 
must also pass a more thorough investigation, including employment and 
financial background checks and Federal Bureau of Investigation checks, 
Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
Before a state license is issued, the prospective owners must receive a permit 
from city officials, Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth Landau said Gardena is conducting a separate investigation 
of the partnership's application for a gambling permit from the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extensive Renovations 
</P>
<P>
If the deal goes through, the Horseshoe will be closed for about three weeks 
during expansion and renovation, including removal of walls and redecoration of 
the main gaming room as well as the club's coffee shop and dining room, Stern 
said. Other decorating changes will be done while the club is open, including 
new carpeting, ceilings, chairs and gaming tables, he said. All of the work 
should be completed by August, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the renovations, the buyers plan to expand the club's 250-employee work 
force, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give it a face lift," Stern said. The changes "will make it more 
comfortable for the players and consequently we hope we can attract more 
business." 
</P>
<P>
With monthly revenues averaging about $400,000, the Horseshoe Club is the least 
profitable of the city's three clubs, which together earn about $2.3 million a 
month, city records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandie Club is the most profitable, followed by the Eldorado Club. 
</P>
<P>
The three clubs provided $3.7 million in revenue to the city from taxes and 
licensing fees in fiscal year 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
The Horseshoe Club was established in 1947 and has been owned since 1951 by a 
limited partnership of about 100 investors, said club spokesman Milt Corwin, 
general partner of the selling partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin would not disclose details of the group's original investment or return. 
He said the group was "interested in selling because the active partners are up 
in years and wanted to step down."

DREAMS COME TRUE FOR POMONA POLICE BRINGING JOY TO AILING BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boy's wildest dreams were obviously coming true when Pomona police gave 
Christopher Wilson everything they could think of. 
</P>
<P>
And that may be only the beginning. By the time they're through, Chris may have 
visited the Statue of Liberty and Disney World, and dozens of football-playing 
policemen will have had dreams of their own fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Six-year-old Chris, who was born with cystic fibrosis, has already had a ride 
in the Pomona police helicopter and on a police motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
His benefactors include the Pomona Police Officers Assn., officers of the state 
Department of Corrections and the Make A Wish Foundation, which makes dreams 
come true for youngsters under 18 who have life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
It all began when members of the police association, who often play on other 
football teams, decided to form their own squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go out and beat our brains out, and the recognition would go to the team 
we were playing for," said Pomona Detective Ray Birch. "We wanted some of the 
glory that we were helping others to get." 
</P>
<P>
So did officers of the California Institute for Men in Chino, who had the same 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they figured that they could raise a lot of money if they held a 
charity football game and sold all the tickets themselves, rather than paying 
an agency to solicit ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donating Stadium 
</P>
<P>
The athletic department at Chaffey College in Alta Loma is donating its 
football stadium, uniforms and personnel for the game, which will begin at 7 
p.m. Friday. Tickets cost $3 for adults and $1 for children 5 to 17. Younger 
children will be admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
When plans started falling into place, Birch said, the police association asked 
the Make A Wish Foundation to choose a special child to help. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Wilson said her son had been recommended to the foundation by a teacher 
who tutors him in his La Verne home, through the Bonita Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Chris easily qualified for consideration, said Betty Strong of Riverside, 
speaking for the Make A Wish Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the football game will not go directly to Chris but into a 
general fund, Strong said. The foundation spends an average of $2,000 for each 
wish it fulfills. She said many hotels provide rooms free or at reduced cost, 
and the foundation gives each member of the family $50 spending money each day 
of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect on their lives is the excitement they get, the happiness," Strong 
said. "It's an upper you can't believe." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Pomona officers competed for Chris' attention during a recent 
get-acquainted visit. They urged him to accept a special cake, badges, a helmet 
and a baton. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe how much this is doing for us," Birch said. "The kind of 
thing we see every day out on the streets -- we really need this. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the perfect kid," Birch said as he watched Chris easily take over the 
entire police facility. 
</P>
<P>
Chris is a blue-eyed, blond charmer with a disease that a spokesman at the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Southern California called "the No. 1 genetic 
killer of children and young adults." 
</P>
<P>
His big wish, say his parents, Deborah and Scott Wilson, is to see the Statue 
of Liberty. Disney World comes a close second. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Plans 
</P>
<P>
All that will probably come true soon after next week's game, Strong said. She 
has begun making plans for the whole family -- including 3-year-old Cory -- to 
spend a week traveling to New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Chris, who is in good health right now, required surgery for an intestinal 
blockage six hours after he was born, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis clogs the lungs and digestive tract and makes its victims 
susceptible to pneumonia and other infections. Gary Green, executive for the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, said most of the 35,000 victims in the United 
States have a life expectancy into their mid-20s. He said scientists may soon 
be able to identify the gene that causes the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Wilson said Chris receives regular intravenous feedings and sleeps with 
a mask and a humidifier to ease his breathing. While he appears robust, he is 
not able to attend regular school classes. 
</P>
<P>
After touring the police facility and posing for photographers like a 
professional model, Chris and his mother went to Brackett Field in La Verne, 
where the Pomona Police Department's helicopter is kept. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking forward to this since I first heard about it," said pilot 
Dennis McCall. 
</P>
<P>
A somewhat reluctant Chris was persuaded to mount a cycle. He immediately 
identified the button that operated the siren. 
</P>
<P>
He lasted as long as the police officers did that afternoon, running, leaping, 
grinning and clutching his new possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave out and slept on the way home, but it was wonderful while it lasted," 
said his mother.

OFFICIAL SUES FOES FOR LIBEL, SLANDER; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDANTS SAY CHARGES PART OF POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defendants in a libel and slander lawsuit brought by San Gabriel Vice Mayor 
Frank Blaszcak filed a response this week, saying campaign statements they 
allegedly made about him, including assertions that he was involved in drug 
sales, were merely part of fair political play. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed Tuesday in Pasadena Superior Court, the 12 defendants, all of 
whom opposed Blaszcak in last year's City Council election, questioned the 
legal basis for Blaszcak's suit, characterizing it as "an improper effort to 
resist a recall effort directed at him." 
</P>
<P>
The statements in question "do not amount to more than the usual slings and 
arrows which members of society are expected to encounter -- especially when 
they throw themselves into hotly contested local elections," their response 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, including a councilman, a former mayor, two former planning 
commissioners and the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, challenged 
Blaszcak's claim that he had been the victim of "intentional infliction of 
emotional distress" by political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Essential Element' 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blaszcak certainly must have expected to meet vigorous opposition, harsh 
criticism and attacks upon his character and qualifications for the office he 
was seeking," the defendants said in papers prepared for them by the Los 
Angeles law firm of Beck &amp; De Corso. "This has always been an essential 
element of American politics." 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak, who filed his suit three weeks ago, said Wednesday that he had not 
yet been served with the defendants' response. "Slander and libel stand on 
their own," he said in responding to the assertion that allegations against him 
were normal for American political campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak was elected to the City Council last year after a bitterly contested 
campaign as part of a three-man slate of slow-growth candidates. He faces a 
recall election May 23. 
</P>
<P>
One issue that surfaced frequently during last year's council campaign and this 
year's recall drive is a charge by Santa Ana police 10 years ago that Blaszcak, 
who was then that city's public information director, had offered to procure 
drugs for a police officer. The allegations were investigated by the district 
attorney, who decided not to file charges because of insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
During the council campaign, a flyer put out by a group called Concerned 
Citizens of San Gabriel accused Blaszcak of being "involved in drug sales." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the defendants in Blaszcak's suit were members of the group that put 
out the flyer. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Sabino Cici, one of the defendants, said the quick response was 
an attempt by the defendants to "get into the arena." 
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't been served with his complaint," Cici said. "He's got three 
years to serve us. This could be held over our heads for a long time. If any of 
us were trying to buy a home, say, we'd have to declare that we were engaged in 
a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
He said the defendants' response allows them to subpoena records and testimony 
and to force Blaszcak to make a deposition in the presence of the defendants' 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, it's to Frank's advantage to drop the lawsuit now and pay our 
attorney," Cici said.

SAND VOLLEYBALL THRIVES AS A GAME FOR EXPERT AND BEGINNER ALIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL FEINEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Wednesday morning, a group of friends meets at the Sand and Sea Club on 
Santa Monica Beach for the latest installment of a volleyball game that has 
been going on for more than 50 years. The oldest participants started playing 
before the breakwater was built, back when the tide would nip at the edges of 
the private clubs lining the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Others started during the Depression, and played for apples or, on good days, 
quarters in the shadow of the Santa Monica Pier. The youngest date back to the 
boom years of the late '40s, when the ex-GIs moved here, eager for a taste of 
the good life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watched the Sport Grow 
</P>
<P>
They have played beach volleyball ever since, through the good times and the 
bad, and have seen it grow from a neighborhood curiosity to a bona-fide sport. 
Last year, more than 34 million people in this country participated in 
sanctioned indoor or beach volleyball games. Millions more watched the men's or 
women's professional tours, which are televised on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, beach or, as they are sometimes called, sand volleyball 
clubs have sprung up in unlikely places such as Columbus, Ohio, but virtually 
every top professional player still lives in Los Angeles. In addition, Los 
Angeles hosts perhaps the most fervent and most important grass-roots scene in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are rumors of occasional games on the beaches of Hawaii in the 
early 1920s, the first documented game of beach volleyball was in 1927 at the 
Edgewater Beach Club, a private club near the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Caught on Fast' 
</P>
<P>
After that, says Paul Johnson, one of the country's premier indoor volleyball 
players in the '30s and '40s, "it caught on fast because it was the only game 
that was well suited to the beach. You could jump into the ocean when you got 
tired, eat a hot dog when you got hungry or just stretch out in the sun when 
you were done. Best of all, you didn't have to wear shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the beach game was no different from the indoor variety, with 
six-person teams playing on a full court. If there weren't enough people, a 
team would have four people or, if that's all there were, with two. These 
two-person teams only used a quarter of the court, however, because that was 
all anyone thought they could handle. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one day in 1931, just for fun, Johnson and his three companions decided 
to play on a bigger court. They started with half-court, but didn't like it. 
"Since we were almost there, we decided to cover the whole court," Johnson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Within minutes," he says, "we were flying all over the court, developing 
signals for our movements and working out new strategies. We had such a good 
time that we never played quarter-court again." 
</P>
<P>
By the late '50s, beach volleyball had become a cult sport statewide, and had 
as its undisputed champion a man named Gene Selznick. He would hold court daily 
at Will Rogers State Beach, at the intersection of Chautauqua Boulevard and 
Pacific Coast Highway. As Al Scates, who eventually would guide UCLA's 
volleyball team to 12 national championships in 18 years, remembers, he was 
king of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I had played football and basketball and wanted to learn how to play beach 
volleyball," Scates says. "I was told to go down to State Beach for some basic 
instruction, but was warned to get there early." 
</P>
<P>
Although Scates showed up at 8:30 a.m., there was already a 3-hour wait for a 
court. He and his partner patiently watched until finally, at 11 a.m., it was 
their turn to play. But just as the other team was about to serve, three cars 
pulled up to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Everything stopped while Gene Selznick and an entourage got out of the cars. As 
Selznick surveyed the scene from the parking lot, Scates' opponents waved to 
Selznick and asked if he wanted to take their place. 
</P>
<P>
Scates was shocked because by relinquishing the court, they wouldn't get to 
play until late afternoon. But Selznick graciously accepted their offer and 
took his place against Scates, his due. 
</P>
<P>
Without bothering to warm up, Selznick served a sky ball that "went up about 80 
feet, spun and then came crashing down in front of me," Scates says. Then, 
without breaking a sweat, he demolished Scates and his partner and sent them 
back to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
These days, with more than 300 beach courts between Zuma and Torrance, it is 
much easier to get and stay on a court. However, at certain "volleyball 
beaches," such as Santa Monica State Beach, Muscle Beach in Venice (south of 
the Santa Monica Pier) and Marine Avenue beaches in Manhattan Beach, where many 
of the professional players practice, "the scene can still get intense," says 
Sinjin Smith, the six-time world champion who is the sport's most successful 
player and author of "Kings of the Beach" (Power Books), a book chronicling its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, he explains, beach volleyball is fairly informal. The courts 
(not the nets or balls) are provided by the city or county on a first-come, 
first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
Pickup games are the norm, especially among beginners. 
</P>
<P>
But, Smith says, "one noticeably less-skilled player can destroy a game. Since 
many of the people at the local beaches are professional players whose 
livelihood depends upon the quality of their training, and others take the game 
seriously, it is inconsiderate to ask to play in a game that is above your 
ability level." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to play with them or with others who are equally serious 
about the game, Smith recommends watching how they play. Then, after getting a 
feel for what is going on, join a more casual game on one of the side courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tips for the Novice 
</P>
<P>
You will understand the action better if you already know the sport's basic 
rules: 
</P>
<P>
 -- As in indoor volleyball, each team can hit the ball three times before 
putting it over the net. An individual, however, cannot hit the ball twice in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only the team that serves can score a point. If the other team wins the 
volley, it wins the serve and the right to score but not the point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Games generally go to 15 points, and must be won by 2. So that the sun and 
wind do not give one team an advantage, teams change sides every 5 points. 
</P>
<P>
The court and net are the same height and size as an indoor court, but the 
beach ball is made of leather (for suppleness), is heavier (to compensate for 
the wind) and has more give (for control) than its indoor counterpart. Although 
cheaper models are available, a good ball generally retails from $40 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Team Size Varies 
</P>
<P>
Competitive beach games usually are two-person-team affairs, but recreational 
games can have anywhere from two to six people on a side. Games with more 
players on a team tend to keep the ball in play longer, but are less demanding 
for the players. 
</P>
<P>
Although the game is relatively easy to learn and enjoy, the best way to 
establish good technique is by attending a beach volleyball clinic. The 
Manhattan and Hermosa Beach Department of Parks and Recreation and experts such 
as Smith and Scates all conduct clinics from time to time. For dates and 
locations, call the appropriate park department or the California Beach 
Volleyball Assn., (213) 635-6666, or consult Volleyball Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic or no, beginners do not have to worry much about being injured on the 
court. While 100-m.p.h. serves take their toll on the professionals' knees and 
shoulders, the pace of the recreational game reduces the risk to the casual 
player and explains why it can be played at all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually the biggest dangers, Smith reports, are bruised fingers and burned 
feet. Although fingers can find their way into the path of a moving ball, 
burned feet can be prevented by wearing shoes. Most people, however, take their 
chances, because they move better if their toes grip the sand. 
</P>
<P>
As with other sports, the best protection from injuries is an effective 
warm-up. Move slowly, and gently hit the ball around at first. Gradually 
intensify the activity for about five minutes. Then, after your muscles loosen 
up, take your place in the sun and get ready to shine.

LUMMIS GARDEN BLOOMS FOR OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN HEYES, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Time for a bit of horticultural free-associating. 
</P>
<P>
What do you think of when you hear the words water-conserving plants? 
</P>
<P>
Cactuses? Succulents? A sandy, austere and generally grayish landscape? 
</P>
<P>
If so, you are not alone. And the Historical Society of Southern California has 
a surprise for you. 
</P>
<P>
Its newly completed water-conserving garden, outside the Charles F. Lummis Home 
in Highland Park, is lush with shoulder-to-shoulder greenery, blossoms of many 
hues and even a lawn of sorts. The garden, designed by landscape architect Bob 
Perry, will be the featured attraction at the society's third annual Lummis 
Garden Open House, Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Green Despite Heat 
</P>
<P>
"This garden in the middle of August and September, when it's really hot, still 
looks green and pretty," says Suzie Chamberlain, coordinator of garden 
volunteers. It demonstrates, she says, the number and variety of attractive 
blooming plants that are drought- tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
Begin at the gate -- recently moved down Carlota Boulevard so visitors must 
walk through the garden -- and you'll see the subdued colors of the Mexican 
sage up against the shock of orange that is the California poppy. At their feet 
are delicate baby blue eyes, another spring-blooming California native. 
</P>
<P>
And that "lawn" in the center is actually dwarf pink yarrow (Achillea 
millefolium). Grown from seed, it can exist on a mere 15 minutes a week of 
summer watering and needs no watering in the winter. Left to its own, the 
yarrow would grow spiky pink flowers up to about 2 feet in height, but 
infrequent mowing can keep it down as a grass substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a surface you could walk on, sit on and, because the 
garden is cared for by volunteers, not have to mow on a regular basis," 
Chamberlain says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Non-Native Plants Too 
</P>
<P>
Though the garden contains a number of plants native to this area, it also 
includes species that originate in Mexico, the Mediterranean and South Africa 
-- "places with a climate like ours, with a long dry spell every year," says 
Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-minute-a-week watering standard holds for the entire 1.8-acre garden. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to the usual flower-bed color provided by thirsty pansies, 
marigolds and impatiens, the Lummis Home garden offers herbs (rosemary, sage, 
thyme, lavender), poppies (such as the hardy, 5-foot-tall matilija poppy) and 
easily sown wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
Deceptively fragile-looking spring flowers adorn the abuse-tolerant rockrose, a 
low-growing shrub that can stand up to salt spray, frost, scorching heat and 
poor dry soil. "Carmel Sur" manzanita, Chamberlain says, could take the place 
of ivy as a border planting. 
</P>
<P>
For shade, consider the Western sycamore tree, the California holly (or toyon), 
the yellow-flowered sweet acacia or the singleleaf pinon pine. 
</P>
<P>
Bulbs and even ferns also are represented in the water-conserving garden. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the species in the garden can be found at or ordered through retail 
nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drip-Irrigation System 
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the garden is the recently completed drip-irrigation system. 
Such a setup, Chamberlain explains, can apply precious water right where it is 
needed, with virtually no evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Simple to install, the system involves plastic tubes laid on the ground and 
covered with mulch. It is practical for plants widely separated, but not for 
those crowded together as in, say, ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's open house celebrates completion of the 3-year project to redesign the 
major garden area. The effort was financed largely by donations from the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power, the Metropolitan Water District, the 
Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is scheduled to speak at the open house at 1:30 p.m. The 
event also will include tours led by botanists and naturalists, sale of 
hard-to-find plants and seeds, free refreshments and sale of books on gardening 
and local history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lummis Home 
</P>
<P>
The Lummis Home, called El Alisal (the Place of the Sycamore), is itself a 
chapter in Southland history. With its rough-cut beams and granite boulders, 
the structure was built on the west bank of the Arroyo Seco around the turn of 
the century by Charles Fletcher Lummis, who, having walked from Cincinnati in 
143 days, burst onto the local scene in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
Enchanted by the Spanish roots of Southwestern culture, Lummis laid the stones 
himself for the house that became a museum of the Southwest and a Spanish 
fantasy. A scholar, journalist, social activist and rabid Southern California 
booster, the eccentric Lummis surrounded himself with artists and writers at 
Saturday-night soirees in El Alisal. 
</P>
<P>
Although today it is headquarters of the historical society, visitors Sunday 
will see a house that has been largely preserved as Lummis knew it. 
</P>
<P>
The Lummis home is at 200 E. Avenue 43, Los Angeles, just off the Pasadena 
Freeway. Admission to the event is free. Information: (213) 222-0546.

DAY HIKE: CHARMLEE PARK BLOOMS TINT SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charmlee, a country park perched in the Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu, 
often has outstanding spring wildflower displays. Most of the park is a large 
open meadow. This meadow burned in 1985, thus the flower display, given timely 
rainfall, is still quite good. Lupine, paintbrush, larkspur, Mariposa lily, 
penstemon and California peony bloom everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Stop at Charmlee's nature center and inquire about what's blooming where. Also 
pick up a copy of a brochure that explores the park's Fire Ecology Trail. This 
nature trail interprets the important role of fire in Southern California's 
chaparral communities. 
</P>
<P>
Good views are another reason to visit Charmlee. The Santa Monica Mountains 
spread east to west, with the Simi Hills and Santa Susana Mountains rising to 
the north. Down the coast you can see Zuma Beach and Point Dume and up the 
coast Sequit Point in Leo Carrillo State Park. Offshore, Catalina Island and 
two of the Channel Islands -- Anacapa and Santa Cruz -- can sometimes be seen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named for Two Owners 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the early 1800s, this Malibu meadowland was part of Rancho 
Topanga-Malibu-Sequit and was used to pasture cattle. For 1 1/2 centuries, 
various ranchers held the property. The last of these private landholders -- 
Charmain and Leonard Swartz -- combined their first names to give Charmlee its 
name. Los Angeles County acquired the Charmlee property in the late 1960s and 
eventually opened the 460-acre park in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
For the hiker, Charmlee is one of the few parks, perhaps even the only park, 
that actually seems to have a surplus of trails. Quite a few paths and old 
ranch roads wind through the park, which is shaped like a big grassy bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Because the park is mostly one big meadow fringed with oak trees, it's easy to 
see where you're going and improvise your own circle tour of Charmlee. Bring a 
kite and a picnic to this little-known park and take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From Pacific Coast Highway, about 12 miles 
up-coast from Malibu, head into the mountains on Encinal Canyon Road. Drive 4 
1/2 miles to Charmlee Natural Area County Park. 
</P>
<P>
The nature center is south of the parking lot. For more information about the 
park and its interpretive programs, call (213) 457-7247. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Walk through the park's picnic area on a dirt road, which travels 
under the shade of coast live oaks. The trail crests at a low rise, offers a 
couple of side trails to the left to explore and soon arrives at a more 
distinct junction with a fire road leading downhill along the eastern edge of 
the meadow. This is a good route to take because it leads to fine ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the road as it skirts the eastern edge of the meadow and heads south. 
Several ocean overlooks are encountered, but the official overlook is a rocky 
outcropping positioned on the far southern edge of the park. Contemplate the 
coast, then head west to the old ranch reservoir. A few hundred yards away is 
an oak grove, one of the park's many picturesque picnic spots. 
</P>
<P>
You may follow any of several trails back to the trailhead or join Fire Ecology 
Trail for a close-up look at how Southern California's Mediterranean flora 
rises phoenixlike from the ashes.

GENE AUTRY MUSEUM SALUTES THE WOMEN OF THE WILD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With typical myopia borne of chauvinism, they talk about the Old West as the 
idyllic era when "Men Were Men." Starting this weekend, the Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum will take a giant step toward correcting the impression, in a 
wide-open tribute to "Daring Women of the Wild West." 
</P>
<P>
The two-month salute will draw overdue attention to the role of women in 
Western rodeos and shows from the 1800s to the present. Focus of the show will 
be an exhibit lent by the Buffalo Bill Cody Center of Cody, Wyo. (Cody's shows 
featured a variety of feisty and courageous female performers), an exhibit 
enhanced by Autry's own collection of show material from the 1880s through the 
"Golden Age of Rodeos" in the 1920s up to the barrel racers and other distaff 
daredevils of today. 
</P>
<P>
Special entertainment and pertinent films will include a pair of one-man shows 
by actor Eric Sorg, next Tuesday through April 16. Matinee performances, titled 
"Annie Oakley and the Wild West," will trace "Li'l Missy's" career as seen 
through the eyes of Cody, her mentor. Evening shows are "Cody! An Evening With 
Buffalo Bill," not entirely pertinent to the theme but a fascinating attempt to 
separate the reality from the myth of Cody. 
</P>
<P>
A series of musical performances will kick off today at 2 p.m. with Patsy 
Montana -- first female Western singer to sell a million copies of her records 
-- and an all-women Western band playing twice each afternoon on April 29 and 
May 29. Other entries in a rich and varied program will be cowgirl roping, 
Hollywood stuntwomen and films (Barbara Stanwyck 's "Annie Oakley" and Gail 
David's TV series of the same name). 
</P>
<P>
General admission to the museum, at 4700 Zoo Drive in Griffith Park (adjacent 
to the zoo), is $4.75, students and seniors $3.50, children 2-12 years $2. 
Theater admission is $3 for the general public and $1 for museum members and 
paid visitors. Call (213) 667-2000. DICK RORABACK

FAMILY SPOTS: CHILDREN'S MUSEUM RUNS ITS READING MARATHON THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Children's Museum's 60-hour Reading Marathon, which started 
last night, continues through Sunday afternoon as volunteer Boy Scouts and Girl 
Scouts camp out in the museum and read and listen to stories through the night. 
</P>
<P>
Topics change every hour. Today's schedule includes African stories at 11 a.m., 
Armenian stories at noon, Middle Eastern at 1 p.m., Latin American at 2, 
Chinese at 3 and bilingual Spanish stories at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon is a rare opportunity for visitors to explore the museum during 
off-hours. Between today's closing at 5 p.m. and Sunday's 10 a.m. opening, 
families may visit the museum free for a two-hour stint, which must include a 
minimum of a half-hour listening to stories. Families must call the museum in 
advance to arrange this. After-hours stories begin at 5 p.m. with Korean tales. 
The schedule continues with prehistoric times at 6 p.m., magic at 7 p.m., music 
at 8 p.m., science fiction from 9 to 11 p.m. and scary stories from 11 p.m. to 
1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, there will be myths and legends, and kids reading comic 
books aloud. Sunday the museum opens with toddler tales at 10 a.m., stories by 
Isaac Bashevis Singer at 11 a.m., Carl Sandburg Rootabaga stories at noon, 
musical stories at 1 p.m., survival stories at 2 and stories by Leo Politi at 
3. The marathon ends at 4 p.m. with a reading of Munro Leaf's "The Story of 
Ferdinand," read by the author's son, James G. Leaf. Cake will be served after 
the reading. 
</P>
<P>
This ambitious project is an official event of the Year of the Young Reader, 
proclaimed by Congress for 1989, and is intended to focus on the important role 
that books and reading play in the development of children. The museum is at 
310 N. Main St., Downtown. Admission during regular museum hours (10 a.m. to 5 
p.m.) is $4; under 2, free. Information: (213) 687-8801.

THE KATHY FISCUS STORY: TURNING POINT IN TV NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STAN CHAMBERS, The author, a reporter for KTLA Channel 5 for the last 41 
years, covered the Kathy Fiscus tragedy 40 years ago this weekend. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old letters and newspaper clippings from yellowed and crumbling scrapbooks 
helped me sharpen the memories of that April weekend in San Marino 40 years ago 
when rescuers tried to save 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus. She had fallen into an 
abandoned well shaft that was only 14 inches in diameter and became trapped 
more than 100 feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy had been running and playing with her cousins in an open field covered 
with tall spring grass when she disappeared that Friday. Her cries could be 
heard, but she was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy's mother screamed for help and emergency crews soon converged on the 
field and the rescue attempt began. 
</P>
<P>
As efforts continued Saturday, one of television's brilliant pioneers, KTLA 
General Manager Klaus Landsberg, made the decision to provide live coverage. 
All programming and commercials were canceled, and Bill Welch and I began our 
open-ended, uninterrupted reports from the scene that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA's marathon, 27 1/2-hour coverage of the rescue attempt was one of the 
turning points in television history. 
</P>
<P>
Up until then, television was a flickering new novelty and not taken seriously 
by many people. This telecast changed that view forever. People were 
irresistibly drawn to the tragic reality that was taking place on the screen of 
their living-room set. It was a television experience they would remember a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
I still have several people tell me each week how vividly they remember the 
Kathy Fiscus telecast. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as if all of Los Angeles stopped to watch the drama unfold. Neighbors 
who had rarely spoken to each other became close friends as they sat in front 
of black-and-white television sets. They sipped coffee and munched on 
sandwiches throughout the night. A hard-boiled city poured out its tears and 
silent prayers as frantic men worked in a dark tunnel trying to rescue a little 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the devastating moment Sunday night when a doctor used a public 
address system to announce that Kathy was dead. Tired, dirty, beaten men with 
40 and 50 hours of constant work behind them wept openly with bitter tears. 
Rescuers stood silently, heads bowed, unwilling to accept the news. The crowd 
of thousands was stunned. Viewers at home felt the pang of sorrow. There was no 
way to express the loss. 
</P>
<P>
The only solace was the fact that she probably died shortly after she fell into 
the well Friday night and did not suffer long. 
</P>
<P>
The outpouring of mail after the Kathy Fiscus telecast was overwhelming and 
emotional. It also bore witness to the powerful, yet intimate role that 
television would come to play in its viewers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Until last night, the television set was no more a threat to serenity than any 
other bit of furniture in the living room. Now you have utterly destroyed this 
safety forever. . . ," wrote a man named Stewart Stern. 
</P>
<P>
"You and the epic of which you have been a part of this weekend have made us 
know that we belong to the world. Through your own dignity and your recognition 
of the dignity of others, you have given us a flash of people at their best, as 
we remember them in the battle, or as I've just seen them at the Negev outposts 
in Israel. Many of us had seen you with your polite faces and amiable voices, 
but none of us had known you until the voices lost their amiability and the 
polite faces were beginning to sprout beards, along with our own, and you 
became a part of the rest who will never be forgotten by those of us who saw 
you there."

I don't understand Robert Hilburn's April 4 review of the Morton Downey Jr. 
album: He neglected to compare Downey's work with that of Springsteen, U2, REM 
or Dylan. He also never said whether the songwriting was "compelling." 
</P>
<P>
So, did Bob like the album or not? Please tell Hilburn to stick to the formula 
we've all grown to know and love.

OPERATIC RICHES ON THE PORCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must express my regrets over music critic Martin Bernheimer's recent forays 
in New York. I'm an opera fan who does not think it is the job of The Times to 
tell me what's going on in the Big Apple. (The fact that I couldn't care less 
what Marty thinks also has something to do with it.) 
</P>
<P>
With San Francisco and San Diego running full tilt, there is enough opera in 
California without having to send out Mr. B. as our good-will ambassador. (Now 
it all becomes clear why Angelenos have such a bad rep in N.Y.) 
</P>
<P>
I realize "everything is local news," but opera reviews don't travel well. 
Let's focus on the riches on the back porch, shall we?

INTERRACIAL LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was enthusiastic about the new NBC soap opera "Generations" until I read a 
comment by Sally Sussman, creator of the series, that she and her writing team 
avoided interracial love scenes because "interracial romance has been done to 
death" (Diane Haithman's March 27 article). 
</P>
<P>
Does she feel that romance between whites "has been done to death" also? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there have been few interracial love affairs in films and television. 
I can easily count the explicit rather than implied interracial romances, 
especially those featuring blacks with non-blacks.

PURPOSE OF THE JIMMIES

<P>
In her March 29 article on the Media Awards given by the Assn. of Asian-Pacific 
Americans Artists ("Jimmie Awards Mark Dispelling of Race Stereotypes"), 
Claudia Puig mistakenly reported that the Jimmies honor "best" play, "best" TV 
series, etc. Actually, the awards are more of a symbol of encouragement for 
progress in the entertainment industry, recognizing the companies, producers 
and individuals who present honest portrayals of Asian-Pacific Americans and 
their culture.

FACES . . .: BACK FROM THE BRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD KLADY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Cyborg," actress Dayle Haddon portrays the title character, part human, 
part machine, who carries the antidote to overcome a world plague. It's her 
first American feature in almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I just moved to L.A. from Paris last year," she explained. "I did it because I 
wanted to concentrate on my acting career and put behind the personal tragedy 
in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Haddon's best remembered as the face in Max Factor, Revlon and other major 
beauty company ads. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out as a dancer and modeling paid for classes. But it was always 
something temporary. When I moved to New York, I also studied acting. So, I've 
juggled the three things and tried to remember that my personal life and 
happiness was the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Montreal, Haddon was hired by the Eileen Ford Agency as a teen-ager. 
However, she realized as a non-blonde that her career options were limited in 
America and went to France where she worked with everyone from Cecil Beaton to 
Avedon, Snowden and Helmut Newton. "Most people find modeling boring, but when 
you work with the best, you're challenged. You must deliver, so it's 
emotionally draining." 
</P>
<P>
Although she'd appeared in several films, it was not until "North Dallas 40" in 
1979 that she was offered major roles. Still, recently married, she opted for 
staying close to home. Then in 1984, her husband, Glenn Souhnam, was murdered. 
The owner of a security firm, his killing was linked in news reports to several 
international intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot I can't say and there's a lot I don't know," said Haddon. "No 
one's ever been charged, and the FBI maintains an ongoing investigation. I 
don't want to sound dopey, but I've been very lucky. I've received a great deal 
but not everything in life is going to be positive. Things happen and how you 
deal with them is how you grow." 
</P>
<P>
Since "Cyborg," she completed "Silence Like Glass" with Jami Gertz and Martha 
Plimpton, in which she portrays a psychiatrist in a cancer ward. "I find it 
ironic that I'm always cast in strong roles, but at least this part is a 
departure." LEONARD KLADY

BLACK TALKIES ON PARADE PUTS FILMS ON VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen works on black themes by promising film makers will be shown this 
afternoon at 1:30 p.m. at the Four Star Theatre, 5112 Wilshire Blvd., as part 
of the 11th annual Black Talkies on Parade, organized by the Black American 
Cinema Society. 
</P>
<P>
The first-prize winner, carrying a cash award of $1,500, is Sandra Sharp's 
"Tribes," which makes ingenious use of graphics and animation to shape the 
charmingly wry, tender story of a young girl confronting her mixed African and 
American Indian heritages. 
</P>
<P>
John Brown won the $1,000 second prize for his haunting and poignant "Tweet," 
which, in evocatively grainy black-and-white against a sinuous background of 
John Coltrane's version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "My Favorite Things," 
shows the confrontation between a young boy determined to be a musician and an 
aging, reclusive jazz trumpeter. 
</P>
<P>
Third prize of $750 went to Yule Caise for "Shoes," a tense, urban drama of 
confused adolescence in a culture that seems to value clothes, style -- and 
guns -- above life, loyalty and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
The three honorable mentions, carrying cash prizes of $100 apiece, were won by 
Marie Kellier for "Minstrels," a documentary on the street comics of Venice 
Beach's boardwalk; Celeste A. Frazier's work-in-progress, "Dreams Deferred," a 
"Twilight Zone"-style time-warp meeting between an '80s black restaurant owner 
and the '50s white bigot who blighted his youth; and Zernaba Davis' 
experimental and brilliantly innovative reflection on black womanhood, 
"Cycles." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the remainder of the festival, which continues through Thursday, 
Black Talkies on Parade offers a generous mix of classics from the past, films 
by pioneering directors like Oscar Micheaux or early stars like Paul Robeson, 
Bill (Bojangles) Robinson and Josephine Baker, mingled with more recent movies, 
like 1978's "Sounder" (Tuesday) or 1982's "Gospel" (Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
This year's selection features a special tribute to jazz singer Billie Holiday 
(in four films shown throughout the week), alongside such jazz greats as Louis 
Armstrong and the bands of Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Also scheduled are 
such excellent recent movies such as Euzhan Palcy's 1983 Martinique boyhood 
tale, "Sugar Cane Alley" (Wednesday), and Gordon Park's musical biography of 
"Leadbelly" (Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
A few other recommendations: the rare, bizarre 1951 film version of Richard 
Wright's "Native Son," shot in South America by a French director and featuring 
Wright himself as Bigger Thomas; Otto Preminger's film of the 
Bizet-and-Hammerstein musical "Carmen Jones" (Sunday); Sidney Poitier going toe 
to toe with the late John Cassavetes in Martin Ritt's 1957 "Edge of the City" 
(Tuesday); and Vincente Minnelli's superb 1943 musical, "Cabin in the Sky," 
with Ethel Waters, Eddie (Rochester) Anderson, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne and 
Duke Ellington's great 1943 orchestra (Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
Film makers receiving prizes and cash awards will be feted at a reception and 
screening May 7 at the Writers Guild of America.

RASMUSSEN HAS ASTROS FOOLED; PADRES WIN, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fooled 'em again. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen sat in front of his locker beneath the Astrodome and smiled 
late Friday after surviving eight innings of line drives and long fly balls and 
balks and everything else that can happen to a pitcher who doesn't throw the 
ball much faster than the average interstate speed limit. He smiled because 
that kind of pitching in his season debut had just given the Padres a 5-3 
victory over the Houston Astros in front of a paid crowd of 15,971. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not always able to do this," he said. "But I've always had to be able to 
do this." 
</P>
<P>
Fooled 'em again. Down the hall, Glenn Davis sat with his head in his locker, 
smiling only at the wonder of it all. In the first inning with no outs and 
runners on first and second, the Astros' power-hitting first baseman had 
sharply grounded into a double play. In the third, with one out and a man on 
first, he had flied out to center field. He had done this off weird pitches 
from that guy with the awkward windup, and he couldn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the kind of night where you walk off the field wondering, 'How did that 
guy beat you?' " Davis said "He didn't have anything overly spectacular. He's 
just not over spectacular. He gives you something to hit . . . and then you 
wonder why you don't hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Hang on -- Davis was just getting started. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I felt like I was all over that guy tonight. I would foul him off, 
foul him off. And then he would get me. It just makes you wonder." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing this, is it any wonder the Padres are now 2-2 and feeling good about 
themselves again? Is it any wonder Rasmussen, allowed to be his funky self when 
he came over from the Cincinnati Reds last year, went 14-4 with a 2.55 
earned-run average? 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that the Padre pitching staff, which entered Friday still 
looking for a starter to get them through seven full innings, finally found 
that guy in Rasmussen? Although the game took nearly three hours, Rasmussen 
lasted eight innings, allowing just two earned runs (three overall) on eight 
hits with six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
He was provided with the victory thanks to tie-breaking RBI hits in the sixth 
by Benito Santiago (single) and Garry Templeton (double). And then it was saved 
by -- who else -- Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis entered with a runner on first and one out in the ninth and offered a bit 
of a scare, but nothing like Rasmussen. After allowing an RBI double by 
pinch-hitter Alan Ashby, he retired Alex Trevino on a grounder before walking 
Gerald Young. Then, on a one-and-two pitch, he fooled Rafael Ramirez into a 
grounder to third base that turned into a game-ending double-play, giving Davis 
his second save in two games. 
</P>
<P>
But like Glenn Davis, Mark Davis wanted to talk about Rasmussen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got such deception," Mark Davis said. "He's got that nice slow delivery 
and then, all of a sudden, the ball is on you." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're like me," Rasmussen admitted, "you've got to mix it up." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes you've got to rely on help, which Roberto Alomar provided 
spectacularly in the second inning. Well, maybe the word spectacular should no 
longer be used in the same sentence as Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw him do tonight was great but . . . it doesn't surprise us, nothing 
he does surprises us anymore," Tony Gwynn said. "What would surprise us is if 
he doesn't win a Gold Glove." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second inning. The Padres were up, 2-1, thanks to an error by Glenn 
Davis on a grounder by Gwynn and an RBI grounder by Carmelo Martinez. The 
Astros were coming back against Rasmussen; Bill Doran led off with a double and 
moved to third one out later on Rasmussen's balk. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen struck out catcher Craig Biggio. Up stepped good-hitting pitcher Rick 
Rhoden, who had a lousy but perfect hit. He bounced the ball just to the left 
of Rasmussen, who because of foot problems is not very mobile and had no chance 
at it. The ball found a spot between the pitcher's mound and first, and it 
appeared nobody had a chance at it and the run would score. 
</P>
<P>
Except here came Alomar. He charged, dove at the ball, picked it up and threw 
it before belly flopping on the carpet. It seemed to even stun first baseman 
Jack Clark, who nonetheless made the catch for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
"That could have been a turning point in the game," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," Alomar said. "I know I made the play in the air, 
my feet were not on the floor. I know it was a slow runner, and I had a chance 
so I took a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'd like to see it again. I'd like to see how." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing personal, but Rasmussen didn't really care how. Just as long as he 
lived to pitch another inning. He had escaped the first -- which started with 
consecutive Astro hits by Young (double) and Ramirez (RBI single) -- on Davis' 
double play grounder. He escaped the second with Alomar. But he wasn't through 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up the tying run in the third after a fielding error by Alomar and an 
RBI single by Billy Hatcher. But with runners on first and third, he got a 
grounder from Doran. 
</P>
<P>
Three innings later, in the sixth, he faced his final test after allowing 
leadoff singles to Davis and Kevin Bass. So he retired Doran on a grounder, Ken 
Caminiti on a popout and then struck out Biggio for the third time without 
Biggio ever taking the bat off his shoulder, with a pitch that grazed the 
outside of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not handling the curveball very well, so I gave him the curveball," 
Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
So simple. And yet, and you can check with Glenn Davis on this, so defeating. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Injured pitcher Greg Harris (sore left rib cage) did not throw Friday and 
according to Manager Jack McKeon, he will probably rest through the weekend. "I 
don't want to ruin him now; I think we should just wait," McKeon said. It was a 
frustrating afternoon for Harris. He arrived at the Astrodome on the team bus 
at 5:15 p.m. only to learn that those scheduled for injury treatment are 
supposed to arrive at least an hour earlier. His teammates chided him, partly 
because he's a rookie, but also because he has already proven to be an 
important part of the pitching staff. "They say I should have known better 
about the treatment, but if I knew better, I'd be here," Harris said. "I've 
just never been in this situation before. But I've taken enough grief about it, 
so I'll be here next time." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery was still recovering Friday night from a dose of reality that hit 
him Wednesday night with the death of a good friend, Laszio Nagypal, who had 
been suffering from leukemia. Nagypal played a part in opening day for 
Flannery, making him realize it wasn't such a big deal after all. Just before 
Flannery learned he would be an opening-day starter for the first time in his 
10-year Padre career, he made his last visit with Nagypal. It so upset Flannery 
that he said he needed to drive around San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for an 
hour before going into the clubhouse to face the Giants. His friend, said 
Flannery, taught him as much as any game could. "That last day, I was asking 
him how he took it, how he stood the pain," Flannery recalled. "He looked at me 
as best he could and said, 'You do it with your mind, you do it with your 
mind.' It really makes you think. If he can handle all he went through, how can 
I ever complain about anything? 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how life just goes on after we go. It goes on without us. It really 
makes you think about yourself."

BOYS MARKETS IN MERGER TALKS WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boys Markets, a 54-store Los Angeles supermarket chain catering primarily to 
minority communities, is holding merger talks with another firm, a company 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility of being merged into a larger company," said Peter J. 
Sodini, president of Boys Markets. Sodini would not identify the potential 
buyer, saying only that an announcement would probably be made next week. He 
added that the suitor "would not necessarily be a Los Angeles company." 
</P>
<P>
The talks come a little more than a year after the chain was purchased by 
American Breco Corp., a Century City firm controlled by the wealthy Brener 
family of Mexico. American Breco paid $131 million for Boys and has been 
converting some of the stores into Viva supermarkets, which cater to Latino 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over Boys, the Brener family has remained an active buyer of 
supermarket chains. In September, 1988, American Breco agreed to pay $5 million 
for three stores from the Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, which filed for 
protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The Breners plan to expand the chain 
into 15 stores within five years. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Breners purchased the 18-store Cala Foods chain located in the 
San Francisco area for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
The Breners have launched a campaign to convert much of Boys to stores that 
offer special foods and products that appeal to the Los Angeles area's 
burgeoning Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1924, Boys Markets has been lauded for locating stores in primarily 
minority communities that have been abandoned by the much larger supermarket 
chains. However, it has been criticized for charging higher prices than most 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
Before buying Boys, the Brener family, headed by Alfredo and Gabriel Brener, 
tried and failed to enter the Los Angeles supermarket business in a joint 
venture with Houston-based Fiesta Marts in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The family's American holdings include a real estate development company in 
Denver, a Palm Springs shopping center and a ranch in New Mexico.

<P>
MILKEN BROTHERS PLEAD INNOCENT; 
</P>
<P>
LAWYER SAYS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR INCOME MAY PREVENT A FAIR TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
"Junk bond" innovator Michael Milken and his brother Lowell pleaded innocent 
Friday to racketeering, securities fraud and other charges in a federal 
courtroom swollen with Milken supporters and others eager to witness the 
preliminary step of the history-making trial. 
</P>
<P>
Tanned and smiling in a pin-striped suit and deep red tie, the head of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert's high-yield bond operation in Beverly Hills answered "not 
guilty" in a firm voice when asked how he would plead by U.S. District Judge 
Kimba M. Wood. After Lowell Milken entered the same plea, Michael Milken, his 
wife, Lori, and his attorneys swept down the front steps of the federal 
courthouse to the cheers of dozens of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
One shouted, "Atta boy, Mike." Others wore hats that said, "We believe in you, 
Mike," in a scene that more evoked the appearance of victorious political 
candidates than accused felons. 
</P>
<P>
In an indictment handed up March 30, the brothers and former Drexel trader 
Bruce L. Newberg were accused of turning the investment house into a continuing 
criminal enterprise. The government has asked for the forfeiture of $1.85 
billion in the case, the most important in the 3-year-old Wall Street 
corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
As the Milkens sped away in a limousine, defense attorney Arthur L. Liman told 
reporters he was "deeply concerned" that Michael Milken would not be able to 
receive a fair trial because prosecutors had "broadcast" his 1987 compensation 
of $550 million in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue here is whether or not Michael Milken can get a fair trial 
notwithstanding the fact that he has made that kind of money," he said, 
contending that including the figure in an indictment was "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
The figure "will be on the minds of thousands of people -- including the people 
who will be jurors," Liman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Milken declined to say whether the defense plans any motions to 
try to redress the effects of the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Newberg did not appear for arraignment because he recently injured his back 
while skiing, according to his attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, who declined to say 
where, or precisely when, the accident took place. Newberg is now scheduled to 
be arraigned April 25. 
</P>
<P>
While 42-year-old Michael Milken has become a familiar public figure, his 
brother Lowell had succeeded until Friday in keeping his face out of the press. 
Lowell bears a marked resemblance to his older brother but is several inches 
shorter and has a deeper voice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Hearing Set 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a gray suit, light blue shirt and blue spotted tie, Lowell Milken also 
smiled and looked relaxed as he stood to his brother's left during the 
10-minute arraignment. The Milkens were released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
During the arraignment, the Milkens' wives sat in the second row of the 
audience of several hundred in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Carroll told the judge that prosecutors and defense 
attorneys have made "substantial progress" toward resolving whether they will 
be required to post bond during the trial. The prosecution had reportedly 
earlier sought posting of a $1-billion bond to make it unnecessary for the 
government to freeze the defendants' assets, as it is entitled to do under the 
federal anti-racketeering statute. 
</P>
<P>
A separate hearing will be held before Wood on Tuesday to take up that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken intended to make a few brief comments after the arraignment but 
decided it would be "physically impossible" to do so because of the throng of 
television cameramen and reporters who had waited for hours for his appearance, 
a Milken spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Milkens had eluded the press awaiting their arrival by slipping into the 
courthouse at 11 a.m., more than three hours before the arraignment was 
scheduled. As they awaited the proceeding, they stayed in a small room next to 
the courtroom, where a federal marshal stood guard to shoo away the curious. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Milken friends on hand was Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman of Ingersoll 
Publications Co., a Princeton, N.J.-based newspaper chain. Wedged between TV 
cameramen and reporters as they pursued the defendants and their attorneys 
outside the courthouse, Ingersoll protested, "You people are animals!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exercising 1st Amendment 
</P>
<P>
Among the other Milken supporters were a number of well-dressed young men and 
women from the investment house. A report that federal prosecutors had 
discouraged Drexel officials from organizing a demonstration in support of 
Milken was untrue, prosecutor Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to exercise their First Amendment freedoms, that's not our 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Milkens are probably still not as well known to the public as another 
Wall Street scandal figure, speculator Ivan F. Boesky, the arraignment drew a 
larger crowd than Boesky's 1987 sentencing, according to people who attended 
both.

UEBERROTH, EASTERN UNIONS CONFER ON CONCESSION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the clock running, representatives of former baseball commissioner Peter 
V. Ueberroth began serious negotiations in Washington on Friday with officials 
of Eastern Airlines' three labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
The unions' willingness to grant millions of dollars in wage and work-rule 
concessions by midnight Tuesday is considered the key to Ueberroth putting 
together the deal to buy strikebound Eastern for $464 million. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the pilots union said earlier that they would make 
concessions in hopes of bringing Eastern out of bankruptcy and putting all of 
its planes back into the skies. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists are considered likely to be somewhat more skeptical, having 
expressed hopes at one time that Carl C. Icahn, chairman of TWA, would buy 
Eastern because they believed that the financially ailing carrier would be more 
competitive if aligned with another major airline. Eastern's flight attendants, 
headed by Mary Jane Barry of the Transport Workers Union, are also 
participating in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
For months Icahn has made it known that he was interested in buying Eastern, 
but Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the airline and its parent company, Texas Air, 
would not give him permission to talk to Eastern's unions, a critical 
prerequisite to a purchase. In an apparent attempt to ensure that Icahn is 
unable to buy Eastern out of bankruptcy court, a tactic he is rumored to have 
been contemplating, Texas Air filed suit against him in federal district court 
in Ft. Bend County, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Icahn and TWA are "tortiously interfering" with the 
contract it signed with Ueberroth on Thursday. The suit asserts that Icahn and 
TWA have illegally communicated and negotiated with union groups representing 
Eastern employees, offering inducements to those groups to deal with Icahn and 
TWA rather than the Ueberroth group. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Icahn and TWA are competitors of Eastern and they have every motive to try 
to scuttle these important discussions," Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said, 
referring to the negotiations in Washington. "The delay, confusion and economic 
damage that Eastern would suffer could obviously provide the opportunity for 
Mr. Icahn to buy assets at bargain basement prices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Icahn Unavailable 
</P>
<P>
Union sources have said for some time that Lorenzo did not want Icahn to buy 
Eastern because TWA, bolstered by Eastern, would represent a considerably 
greater competitive threat to Continental Airlines, a non-union carrier also 
owned by Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Buckstein, general counsel of TWA, called the suit "preposterous," but 
declined to coment further until he could review it. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth reportedly is seeking $210 million a year in wage and work rule 
concessions from the unions for the next five years. In return, Eastern's 
employees, unionized and non-unionized, will receive a 30% share of the 
company. The Ueberroth investment group also would own 30% and other investors 
would get 40% if the deal is consummated. 
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent that Ueberroth signed with Lorenzo provides that Ueberroth 
must be able to reach accord with the unions by Tuesday night or the deal is 
voided. Parties familiar with the situation have said they think it is 
unrealistic to think that all details of a new labor contract could be 
concluded that soon but that an agreement in principle, including a 
back-to-work agreement, could be finished by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials are believed to be concerned about how quickly and extensively 
the Ueberroth group would shake up Eastern's management. They have expressed 
little confidence in the company's existing management. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth won't be participating in the talks in Washington today. Instead, he 
will be the final speaker at the annual "Predators' Ball" held in Beverly Hills 
by the investment firm of Drexel, Burnham Lambert Inc. This is the first time 
in the event's history that Michael Milken, former head of Drexel's "junk bond" 
department who is now under federal criminal indictment, hasn't chaired the 
conference. In announcing his purchase of Eastern on Thursday, Ueberroth said 
he had received some unsolicited but helpful advice on the deal from Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in New York Federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Friday 
held a closed door meeting with representatives of all the major players in the 
Eastern situation in an attempt to speed up negotiations. Since Lifland was 
assigned the case after Eastern filed for protection from its creditors on 
March 9, he has made it clear that he wants Eastern planes flying again as soon 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, as in several other major bankruptcies that he has handled, 
Lifland has not been bashful about wielding a heavy club. "He knocked all the 
heads together," said Robert J. Rosenberg, one of the attorneys representing 
Ueberroth. But he declined to discuss any other details of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creditors Quiet 
</P>
<P>
Lifland is likely to be keep pushing hard on all the parties because, as he 
said Thursday, Ueberroth's deal "has not assured the immediate scheduling of 
flights, even on an interim basis." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the unions and the creditors were unusually quiet Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, one creditor's lawyer called the proposed Ueberroth purchase 
"encouraging." But he expressed concerns about how long it might take for the 
deal to be completed and what impact that might have on Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losing $1 Million A Day 
</P>
<P>
"If they try to fly again in the meantime (while Eastern is in bankruptcy court 
and before the Ueberroth deal is concluded) will there be losses, and if there 
are losses, who will pay for them?" the lawyer asked. "And there still has to 
be a resolution of the pension payments," he said, referring to reports that 
Eastern has pension liabilities in the range of $300 million to $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing Friday, Lifland granted a motion by Eastern to require other air 
carriers to honor Eastern's tickets. A lawyer for the company had said such an 
order was needed to enable Eastern to keep 10% of its operations running, as it 
has since the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern currently has cash reserves of about $206 million and hopes to have 
more than $500 million on hand by the end of May, if a sale of its Northeastern 
shuttle to real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump for $365 million is completed. 
Company officials have said that Eastern is currently losing about $1 million a 
day. The carrier lost more than $500 million in the last two years.

Castle &amp; Cooke Inc.: The Los Angeles-based holding company for Dole Food 
Co. and Oceanic Properties Inc. reported first-quarter net income of $12.5 
million, down 49% from the same period a year ago. Revenue inched up 2% to $563 
million. The firm attributed the results to a pretax provision of $10 million 
for anticipated costs associated with the temporary ban on the sale of Chilean 
fruit by the Food and Drug Administration in mid-March, lower residential sales 
in Hawaii and higher interest expense due to a combination of higher interest 
rates and additional debt incurred to support the company's capital investment 
program.

NWA REJECTS MARVIN DAVIS' $2.6-BILLION BID AS TOO LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NWA Inc., parent company of Northwest Airlines, Friday rejected a $2.62-billion 
takeover offer by oil investor Marvin Davis, saying it was too low. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who holds about 3% of NWA, said last week he wanted to purchase NWA for 
$90 a share. He said he wanted to expand the airline and make it stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said his move was prompted in part by an NWA statement that a second 
outside group, which has not been identified, said it might also launch a 
takeover bid for NWA. That group holds 4.9% of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the offer on March 30, Davis said he was seeking a "friendly 
transaction," adding that he considered the price generous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping Tokyo Property 
</P>
<P>
"Our board has carefully considered Mr. Davis' proposal as well as numerous 
other financial and strategic alternatives available to NWA," Chairman Steve 
Rothmeier said Friday. "It is clear that Mr. Davis' proposal does not fully 
reflect the value of NWA." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a possible takeover of St. Paul-based NWA have circulated in 
financial markets for the past few months, due in part to its valuable Tokyo 
real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
NWA turned down a $200-million offer for the Tokyo real estate last year, 
saying it wanted to keep the land for housing employees and development. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the $90-a-share bid is 
"not an unfair price." But Davis' failure to line up financing may have been 
troubling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis didn't persuade NWA that his offer was serious," he said. "The next move 
is to convince the shareholders that it is," Murphy said, adding: "It's going 
to be expensive for Davis to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he was disappointed in the rejection and said he would raise the 
offer if the company's management could show that NWA was worth more. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong, serious interest in owning NWA. In that regard, we are in 
the process of completing financing arrangements for the acquisition and expect 
to be in a position to describe them shortly," Davis said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Record Results 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the offer, Davis noted that his bid represented a 50% premium 
over NWA's stock price over the past few months. Since then, the shares have 
risen more than $20. The stock closed down 50 cents Friday at $88.75 a share, 
before the rejection of the bid was announced.

TANDON CUTS 20% OF ITS U.S. WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tandon Corp., a struggling personal computer maker, slashed its U.S. work force 
by 20% on Friday, laying off 130 of its 650 domestic employees. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the layoffs occurred in Moorpark, Calif., where the company is based, 
and affected nearly every division of the company, including manufacturing, 
engineering and administration, said Tandon spokesman Mike Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon said it needs the cost savings to effectively compete in the personal 
computer market in Europe, where Tandon's sales are concentrated. Tandon's 
worldwide employment, after the layoffs, is now about 1,300, with most of those 
workers located in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The cost savings are particularly important in light of the company's dismal 
fourth quarter last year, Sanders acknowledged. Tandon lost $21.1 million in 
the quarter ended Dec. 31, which led to a $19.9-million loss for the year. The 
company's sales last year rose 7% to $309.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't downplay our loss for the year," Sanders said. "Based on that, the 
company has to get more cost-effective. The whole worldwide (personal computer) 
market is getting more intensely competitive." 
</P>
<P>
After its founding in 1975 by India native Sirjang Lal (Jugi) Tandon, Tandon 
became one of the computer industry's best-known suppliers of disk drives, 
which store and retrieve data inside personal computers. But the company, hurt 
by a severe downturn in the overall computer industry and strong competition, 
lost nearly $200 million in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Tandon decided to sell personal computers itself, and a year ago the 
company sold its data-storage business to Irvine-based Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
With those changes behind it, Tandon was again profitable through much of 1988. 
But the profit evaporated with the fourth-quarter loss, which Tandon blamed on 
shortages of semiconductors used in personal computers, as well as heavy 
marketing and advertising costs related to its push to expand European sales. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon's stock closed Friday at 87.5 cents a share, up 6.25 cents, in 
over-the-counter trading after the company's announcement.

Comex Chief to Resign: The president and chief executive of the Commodity 
Exchange of New York, Alan J. Brody, announced his resignation, effective June 
30. Brody, 36, said he plans to pursue other business opportunities. Brody has 
served as Comex president and chief executive since 1981 and as chairman from 
1987 to 1988, guiding the exchange through the silver crisis of the early 1980s 
and complex internal structural changes and fiscal issues. He also was the 
youngest person ever to be appointed to the presidency of a U.S. futures 
exchange. A committee has been appointed to seek a replacement, officials said. 
The Comex is the world's most active metals futures market. "He has seen us 
through some some turbulent periods, record volume years and a major overhaul 
of our trade processing," Comex Chairman John H. Hanemann said. "It will be 
very difficult to replace him."

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: NOT ALL IRAS ARE FEDERALLY PROTECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: There are lots of articles there days about federal insurance for 
deposits in banks and savings and loans. But I can find no specific information 
on insurance for individual retirement accounts held by these institutions. 
</P>
<P>
I have a $265,000 self-directed IRA invested through a federally insured bank. 
The amount is split as follows: $111,000 in a compounding five-year certificate 
of deposit, $100,000 in a one-year certificate of deposit at a federally 
insured savings and loan that is held in the name of the bank, $20,000 in a 
real estate investment trust placed by the bank and $45,000 in a government 
securities mutual fund placed by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Is all my money covered by federal insurance? What are the rules for Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. insurance 
for IRA accounts? There are thousands of retirees with IRAs exceeding $100,000 
who may be at risk without knowing it. -- W. V. L. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You're right: There may be thousands of retirees at risk. And you're 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, IRA accounts at any single savings and loan institution are 
insured up to a total of $100,000 per participant, explains Kathy Nagle, 
director of the insurance division of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which 
administers the fund. The bottom line is that you shouldn't keep more than 
$100,000 in any IRA account or combination of IRA accounts at any single 
federally insured institution if you want to be fully covered by FSLIC 
insurance. (The same general rules apply to accounts at banks covered by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) 
</P>
<P>
These rules are somewhat more strict than those covering normal savings 
deposits. The reason is that an IRA account by its very nature can only be held 
by a single person, while savings accounts and other investments can have 
multiple owners, each of whom is entitled to insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Now back to your portfolio: Just $100,000 of your $111,000 five-year 
certificate of deposit is covered by the bank's insurance. The one-year 
certificate at the S&amp;L is fully covered by FSLIC insurance; but be careful, 
you've reached your limit. Deposits in real estate investment trusts and mutual 
funds are not covered by either FSLIC or FDIC insurance, regardless of whether 
these investments were placed by the bank at your request or not. These 
investments simply don't qualify for federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, write for the brochure titled "Insurance of Accounts" 
from the Insurance Division of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., 
1700 G St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20552. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought a bond between interest payments in early 1987 and paid some 
accrued interest to the seller. I sold the bond in mid-1988. I have heard that 
I can deduct the interest payment to the seller from my proceeds on the bond. 
But there is no place on the tax form to do this. I do not itemize my 
deductions. Please help. -- L. C. M. 
</P>
<P>
A: We can give you some advice, but it's not going to do you much good at this 
point. The interest payment to the bond seller was a plain interest expense for 
1987. And you should have deducted it on your tax filing for 1987, the year in 
which you bought the bond, not 1988, the year you sold it. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the interest payment was a substantial amount, you can file an 
amended 1987 tax return. Only you can judge if the interest deduction is large 
enough to be worth the expense and bother of filing the amended return. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband died and I received about $20,000 in insurance payments from the 
policies we carried on him. Can you tell me if I am required to pay federal 
income tax on this money? -- L. A. M. 
</P>
<P>
A: The short and simple answer is no. There are no income taxes owed on 
straight life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1982, I inherited several Series E savings bonds from my father. I rolled 
them over into Series HH bonds. However, now I am told that the taxes on the 
interest accumulated by the Series E bonds were paid entirely by my father's 
estate. This means that I do not owe any taxes on these bonds when they mature. 
So what do I do? Some of these HH bonds are maturing soon. How can I get the 
government to believe that the taxes were paid when my father died? Do I have 
any chance at all of not paying the tax a second time? -- G. L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, there is more hope than you might think, say our contacts at the 
Federal Reserve. First of all, you should check your bonds to see if they 
include a "tax deferral legend" across the bottom. If the bonds contain this 
notation indicating that the taxes were deferred when the bonds were converted 
from Series E to Series HH, you have work to do. However, if the bonds are 
blank along the bottom, the Federal Reserve Bank has been notified that the 
taxes have been paid on the accumulated interest, and the principal is all 
yours, tax free, when the bonds mature. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if your bonds erroneously contain this tax deferral notation, you must 
prove to the officers of your local Federal Reserve Bank that the taxes have 
been paid. Contact the savings bond manager at the nearest branch of the bank 
-- in Los Angeles the bank is located at 950 S. Grand Ave. in the downtown area 
-- and explain your situation. You will need to present conclusive evidence, 
such as canceled checks and other official documents, proving that the taxes 
were paid by the estate. The savings bond manager should be able to help you 
resolve this matter.

column to financial questions of general interest. Please do not telephone.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: FILING LATE TAX RETURN MAY BE COSTLY LUXURY UNDER 
THE NEW LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sing 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haven't filed that dreaded 1040 yet? You're not alone. About half of the 
nation's taxpayers procrastinate until the last two weeks to file their tax 
returns, the IRS says. Some go even beyond that by filing for extensions -- or 
simply not filing at all. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, if you are thinking about getting an automatic extension by 
leaving the country, the rules have been tightened considerably this year. And 
penalties can be stiff if you fail to file or don't pay all you owe. Also, 
taxpayers who file late tend to make more mistakes; and if your tax preparer 
commits the boo-boos, you're still liable. 
</P>
<P>
Here are answers to some common last-minute questions about filing deadlines, 
extensions, penalties and common mistakes made by procrastinators: 
</P>
<P>
Question: When do I have to file? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: This year, because April 15 falls on a Saturday, you don't have to file 
until midnight, April 17 (that means you have all day Monday, April 17, to 
file). That is also the deadline for making individual retirement account 
contributions for 1988, or Keogh contributions for plans you opened by the end 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if I can't file on time? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can send in Form 4868 before the April 17 deadline to get an extension 
until Aug. 15. But you still must estimate your tax liability and enclose a 
check with the form if you expect to owe more tax. 
</P>
<P>
If you fail to make that payment, you may be subject to a monthly late-filing 
penalty of 5% of the unpaid balance, up to 25%, plus interest charges currently 
set at 12%. That is because your extension could be disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
An extension, however, cannot be granted for making your IRA contributions for 
1988. But you can extend the deadline for making contributions to an 
already-opened Keogh plan. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can I still file late if I don't expect to owe any money? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sure, but if you don't file within three years, you could lose any refund to 
which you are entitled, IRS spokesman Robert Giannangeli says. And if you don't 
file and end up owing money, you will be subject to the 5% late-filing penalty, 
plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
You also could face penalties for not filing certain returns. For example, if 
you make non-deductible contributions to an IRA, but fail to file Form 8606 to 
account for such contributions, you are subject to a $50 penalty ($100 if you 
and your spouse each made non-deductible contributions). 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can I get an automatic extension if I am out of the country on April 17? 
</P>
<P>
A: You used to get an automatic two-month extension on filing, as well as 
paying, if you were out of the country on the deadline date. No more. 
</P>
<P>
Under new, tougher IRS rules that began this year for 1988 returns, you only 
can get an automatic extension if your residence and primary place of business 
both are located outside the United States. Otherwise you must file Form 4868. 
</P>
<P>
"You can no longer just go across the border for lunch" and get an extension, 
says Julian Block, tax expert with Prentice Hall Information Services and an 
attorney in Larchmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if I owe but don't have the cash? 
</P>
<P>
A: File anyway and pay what you can afford. You will be assessed a 
failure-to-pay penalty of 0.5% per month on the unpaid balance, up to a 25% 
maximum, plus interest. But that is a lot less than the 5% failure to file 
penalty, plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
If paying is a real hardship, call the IRS' toll-free number, (800) 424-1040, 
and ask for the accounts section. They may work out an installment plan and may 
waive penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What happens if my preparer makes a mistake? 
</P>
<P>
A: This is a well-justified worry, as a recent Money magazine survey showed 
that more than half of 50 preparers asked to compute tax owed by a hypothetical 
family made significant errors. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, you are still liable for penalties and interest, even if a 
preparer made the mistake. "You're in no way off the hook, so at least take a 
reasonable look at what's been done for you to see if anything is obviously out 
of line," tax adviser Block says. "If there is any question, ask the preparer." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where can I get last-minute advice or forms? 
</P>
<P>
A: Many certified public accountants, enrolled agents and other professional 
preparers are swamped now and cannot properly handle new clients. However, the 
IRS and state Franchise Tax Board are offering extended weekday and Saturday 
hours to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
If you still need forms, it may be too late to get them by phone or letter. You 
may have to go directly to an agency office or to your local library, where 
forms might be available to be photocopied. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the most costly errors made by last-minute filers? 
</P>
<P>
A: One of the most common is forgetting to sign your return. That can delay 
your refund, because the IRS will send back your return for your signature. 
Another common and possibly costly error: failure to include a check for any 
money you owe. That could subject you to the 0.5% late payment penalty, plus 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Other frequent boo-boos include math errors and failure to include your W-2 
form. They also could delay your refunds. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When can I expect my refund? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you had filed earlier in the year, you could have received it within five 
to six weeks. But now, at this late date, don't expect a refund for at least 
eight to 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you file electronically through a tax preparer offering the 
service, you still could have it within three weeks, IRS spokesman Giannangeli 
says. 
</P>
<P>
If 10 weeks have passed and you haven't received your refund, call the IRS at 
(800) 554-4477. A computer will check the status of your refund. But make sure 
you have a copy of your return, because the computer will ask for your Social 
Security number, filing status and the refund you expect. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't receive your refund within 90 days, the IRS owes you interest 
payable at an annual rate of 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will filing closer to the deadline, or filing for an extension, decrease my 
chances of being audited? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some tax preparers say it does. But the IRS contends that the timing of your 
filing makes no difference in your chances of being audited. That is because 
the actual selection process for returns to be audited doesn't start until at 
least a year after the filing deadline, the agency says. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When will I know if I'm going to be audited? 
</P>
<P>
A: The IRS has three years from your filing date or due date (whichever is 
later) to audit your return. If you file for an extension, that extends your 
filing date or due date. But generally, if you haven't been served an audit 
notice within two years after you file, chances are you won't be audited at 
all, tax expert Block says. 
</P>
<P>
There are some exceptions to the three-year rule. You may be subject to an 
audit within six years if you omit income from your return equal to more than 
25% of the total income you report. And you can be subject to audit 
indefinitely if you don't file, or if you file fraudulent returns that omit 
significant income or overstate deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How long do I need to keep records? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally for three years, the period in which you generally can expect to 
be audited. Many taxpayers believe that getting a refund means the IRS has 
approved their returns, and thus they can toss their records. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
"All a refund check means is that the IRS has checked the math on your return, 
and they sent what you show," Block says. "In no way does that mean your return 
has been audited and you can throw your records away." 
</P>
<P>
Some records, such as purchases and improvements on your home or investments in 
stocks, should be kept longer.

HEAT BACKS OFF A LITTLE IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heat wave that has stifled the Southland for 4 days eased off a bit in 
Orange County on Friday, with most areas reporting high temperatures hovering 
near 100 degrees. And forecasters predicted even more cooling this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Weather Service, the temperature climbed to a high in 
Orange County of 100 degrees in San Juan Capistrano on Friday, 9 degrees hotter 
than the previous record of 91 degrees for an April 7 set in Orange in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, however, the mercury hit 105 degrees in Mission Viejo at about 
1:30 p.m., according to Orange County firefighters at the Mission Viejo fire 
station, and 101 degrees in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 Degrees Cooler 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial or not, it was still 7 degrees cooler than the previous day's record 
of 112 degrees set at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which won the 
distinction of being the nation's hot spot Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Orange County, Friday's high temperature was 99 degrees in Santa 
Ana, 98 in El Toro, 97 in Fullerton and 85 in Newport Beach, according to the 
National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Nights remained warm, too. The overnight lows were 55 degrees in San Juan 
Capistrano, 66 degrees in Santa Ana and 77 degrees in El Toro, according to the 
National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
While the fourth consecutive day of sweltering heat was tough on almost 
everyone in the Southland, probably no one had a harder time than the patients 
and employees at two Los Angeles area hospitals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The thermometer peaked at 104 inside the cardiac care unit at the UCLA Medical 
Center on Friday afternoon after a cooling-tower fire Thursday night knocked 
out the air-conditioning for the entire hospital. And, at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center in Lincoln Heights, it was about 100 degrees Friday 
afternoon in some of the wards where there is no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Daniels, a secretary in the UCLA cardiac unit, said she resorted to 
fantasizing about a place she has never been just to get through the day. 
</P>
<P>
"If I just keep thinking, 'I'm in Tahiti. I'm in Tahiti,' then this heat 
doesn't bother me," she said, gazing wistfully at two lemonade cartons she had 
already emptied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot on Weekend 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cooper, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said the sizzling heat should last through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday will be another hot one for much of the area," she said. But in 
Orange County, much cooler days -- with highs in 80s in inland areas and in the 
70s along the beach -- were forecast for today and Sunday, with some late night 
and morning fog to bring a cooling influence, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the strong high-pressure systems that have been dominating the 
weather patterns over the western United States will begin breaking down late 
Sunday, bringing to an end the hot, dry, Santa Ana winds that have been 
parching the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"The real cooling trend won't start until Monday, when we should be back to the 
70s and 80s across most of the area," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Days Away 
</P>
<P>
But that prospect was still 3 days away for Daniels, one of 4,500 employees who 
sweltered through the day Friday along with more than 450 patients at UCLA 
Medical Center. Although the air-conditioning was working by noon, it took 
until nightfall to cool down the seven-story building. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedic ambulance traffic was diverted to other hospitals until 3 p.m. 
Friday, and elective surgeries were postponed until today. 
</P>
<P>
To help those who had to stay inside the hospital, the UCLA center's staff used 
some creative methods. 
</P>
<P>
Fans were placed in every room, and windows, which are normally closed, were 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
'We want to catch any breeze we can," said Suzette Cardin, nurse manager in the 
cardiac unit. 
</P>
<P>
Non-essential lights, computers and other electrical devices were turned off 
and the traditional medical uniforms, which tend to be on the warm side, were 
discarded in favor of cooler garb. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is especially casual today," Cardin said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients were given cool baths and pitchers of ice water were placed at every 
bedside and work station. Brows were sponged with dampened towels. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the patients are just very lethargic . . . but we are not really 
concerned that their conditions will get worse," Cardin said. "We're just going 
to keep an extra close eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, hospital workers were worried about the cardiac unit's computers, 
which are used to monitor patients' heartbeats. Clinical engineer Ray Ford said 
the computers do not work above 94 degrees and the room temperature was 10 
degrees above that. 
</P>
<P>
To cool things down, he used fans blowing over buckets of ice. The makeshift 
cooling system worked. The computers kept on monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers such as Berthe Lyons roamed the UCLA center's sauna-like hallways 
offering a cool drink to anyone in need. A cafeteria worker said ice cream was 
the best-selling item of the day. Hospital personnel were offered free lunches 
and all the juice and lemonade they could consume. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the least they could do," said one nurse, who asked not to be identified. 
"It's miserable. I can hardly breathe." 
</P>
<P>
Patients scheduled to be discharged left unusually early, said nursing manager 
Veronique Rouillard. "They were in a rush to get out of here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Across town at County-USC Medical Center, fans were moved from offices to 
patient wards, especially those on the south side of the hospital, where the 
sun bakes the outer walls during the day. Like their counterparts at UCLA, the 
1,440 patients at County-USC were given cooling baths and swabbed with damp 
towels, and nurses made sure everyone had plenty of cool water to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a high school in Claremont, some students staged a walkout to 
protest the heat and lack of air conditioning in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It was steaming in there," said Josh Crowe, a ninth-grade student at Claremont 
High. "When the bell rang at 12:40, we decided not to go back to class." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Nancy Krause said some of them "came in and asked me to declare a 
minimum day" -- a shortened schedule that would have closed the school for the 
rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I didn't have the authority," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the protesters -- about 150 of the school's 1,800 students 
-- to discuss the problem, Krause said about half of the youngsters went home 
and the others returned to class. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at about 20 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District with 
limited or no air conditioning released students early Friday, according to 
district officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was simply too warm," said Janet Petersen, office manager at San Jose 
Elementary School in Mission Hills, which sent children home an hour early. "I 
didn't hear many students complaining, but the staff certainly felt it." 
</P>
<P>
District officials notified schools on Wednesday that they could release 
students early if the temperatures topped 95 degrees and parents were notified 
24 hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quake Not Related 
</P>
<P>
And if anyone was wondering, Friday's moderate earthquake in Orange County was 
in no way related to the hot spell, according to scientists at the seismology 
laboratory at Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there's an unusual weather condition and an earthquake occurs, people 
associate it with the weather condition," said Riley Geary, an analyst at the 
lab. "The weather had absolutely nothing to do with it."

GIONIS BAIL IS DENIED; NEW DATA IS ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private investigator suspected of directing an attack last year on Aissa 
Wayne and a companion called Dr. Thomas A. Gionis four times about 7 minutes 
after the assault to report that it had been "accomplished," according to a 
criminal complaint released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came as a judge ordered Gionis, a wealthy Pomona surgeon, held 
without bail pending his trial on charges of ordering the Oct. 3 attack on 
Wayne, 32, daughter of the late actor John Wayne, and financier Roger W. Luby, 
52, at Luby's $3-million Newport Beach estate. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom ruled that Gionis, 35, an orthopedic 
surgeon, poses a danger of flight and a threat to Wayne if released. Gionis was 
transferred from the Newport City Jail, where he had been held since his arrest 
Tuesday, to Orange County Jail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled April 17. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Public Friday 
</P>
<P>
The formal complaint was the basis for Gionis' arrest but was made public for 
the first time Friday. Gionis has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have 
suggested that he knew nothing of the assault, allegedly directed by a private 
detective whom Gionis had paid $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the complaint alleges that Gionis kept in close contact with the 
Century City private investigator he had hired, O. Daniel Gal, as the assault 
on his ex-wife and Luby was planned and carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Gal, now at large in Europe but being sought for arrest, called a "planning 
meeting" for the assault in September, the complaint says, and without 
identifying the source of the information, states that Gal told two hired thugs 
that "our 'client' is a doctor and he wants this done because of a 
child-custody dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that Gionis, embroiled in a bitter custody battle over the 
couple's 2-year-old daughter, Anastasia, sought to intimidate Wayne. In 
February, Gionis was awarded custody of the child after his lawyers argued that 
the attack on Wayne showed that the child would be endangered if left in 
Wayne's custody. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, holding that both are fit parents, nevertheless suggested that Wayne 
was "emotionally immature." She was awarded visitation rights. Wayne's lawyer 
said this week, however, that in light of Gionis' arrest, he would try to 
reopen the custody case. 
</P>
<P>
According to the criminal complaint, Gal placed six calls to Gionis while 
conducting surveillance of Luby's gate-guarded estate on the day of the 
assault, Oct. 3, 1988. At about 10 a.m. -- an hour and 50 minutes before the 
attack took place -- Gal placed two calls to Gionis to discuss the assault and 
to advise Gionis to pick up Anastasia, who was at Wayne's home in Corona del 
Mar, the complaint alleges. Gionis had visitation rights that day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Client Is Mad' 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, the complaint alleges, Gal instructed his hired thugs 
about final plans for the assault and after receiving a telephone call told 
them that "our client is mad and wants the job done now because he has an 
upcoming court date on the custody case." 
</P>
<P>
Gal called Gionis again 7 minutes after the attack to inform him of what had 
happened, the complaint charges. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Fernando Valley men who allegedly worked for Gal are in Orange County 
Jail in lieu of $1-million bond each on charges of carrying out the attack. The 
suspects, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, an unemployed apartment manager from 
Burbank, and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool cleaner from Simi 
Valley, also appeared in Harbor Municipal Court Friday for arraignments. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt entered a not-guilty plea Friday, and his preliminary hearing was 
set for May 5. Bouey elected to postpone his arraignment until May 19. Judge 
Bostrom ordered bail for both men to stand at $1 million each as prosecutors 
allege that they, too, pose a substantial escape risk. 
</P>
<P>
In Gionis' bail hearing Thursday, prosecutors showed that numerous overseas 
telephone calls had been made from Gionis' home to Greece, where he has friends 
and family. Last month, Gionis had also obtained a passport for his 2-year-old 
daughter, Anastasia, who is the subject of a custody battle that police contend 
led to the attack on Wayne last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard not to consider that this client is an extremely serious risk to 
flee this jurisdiction," Judge Bostrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorney, Byron K. McMillan, said he will appeal the bail decision 
Monday to the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. McMillan, visibly 
angered by the decision, called Bostrom's no-bail decision excessive for the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"There's murder cases that bail's set on, for Christ's sake," McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans, praised the judge's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he did the right thing," Evans said. "It was a difficult decision for 
him to make. Obviously, he felt there is a danger to public safety." 
</P>
<P>
In concluding that Gionis posed a flight risk, Bostrom said he discounted the 
testimony Thursday of Gionis' sister, Xanthi, who said she had made the calls 
to Greece. Bostrom noted that three of the calls last December that she claimed 
as hers occurred while she actually was traveling in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bostrom cited the passport applications. "It was clear that he had 
the intention of leaving the country while this investigation was (under way)," 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Victims 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom said the evidence also "gives the court great concern about Wayne's 
safety and Luby's." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the crime alleged was a hired assault and in apparent reference to 
Gionis, Bostrom added, "Wealth and power may be used by an individual to 
achieve all sorts of (ends)." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis reacted without emotion to Bostrom's decision, giving a resigned smile 
to his sister before being led away by bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' daughter was to be turned over to her mother Friday for a weekend 
visit. Although the Wayne family could not be reached for comment, Matthew 
Gionis, Gionis' father, said Friday from his home in San Diego that she was no 
longer there. Anastasia has been staying with her grandparents since Gionis was 
arrested. The elder Gionis declined further comment 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Luby filed a lawsuit against Gionis in Orange County Superior 
Court, seeking unspecified damages for the distress he claimed to have suffered 
since the assault.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
ANTI-ABORTION GROUP SUES L.A. MAYOR, POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials with the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue sued Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and others Friday, 
alleging police used excessive force in arresting hundreds of anti-abortion 
protesters last month. 
</P>
<P>
The federal civil rights complaint, filed late Friday afternoon at the Santa 
Ana branch office of the U.S. District Court, seeks unspecified damages, an 
injunction against future police brutality and a court declaration that 
"preborn humans are individuals." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bradley and Gates, the suit named Deputy Chief Robert Vernon and 
an unspecified number of unnamed police officers as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 protesters were arrested during a massive sit-in demonstration 
and counter-demonstration by pro-abortion forces outside a Wilshire-area 
women's clinic on March 25. The anti-abortionists were arrested when they 
refused to disperse from the entrance to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was by far the largest in both numbers participating and numbers 
arrested in 3 days of Operation Rescue demonstrations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sassone, an attorney for Operation Rescue who filed the suit, threatened 
legal action earlier in the week unless Bradley responded to the group's 
allegations of police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley could not be reached for comment Friday. His spokesman, Fred 
MacFarlane, said in response to the earlier threat of a lawsuit: "Let them file 
(suit); we'll talk to them in court." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth responded to the lawsuit, 
saying, "Absolutely no excessive force was used."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
MAN DIES AFTER ATTACK OUTSIDE OF HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man died Friday after he was attacked and stabbed repeatedly by a 
group of men outside of his home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Jaime Serrano, 26, was attacked about 3 a.m. in the 4500 block of West 3rd 
Street by at least six men, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old Santa Ana youth, who was with Serrano, also was beaten but not 
stabbed, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano died 5 hours after the attack at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and 
Medical Center. The youth, whose name was not released for his protection, was 
treated at the hospital for facial injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were returning from a neighborhood market when they were confronted by 
the men. Police said Serrano and the youth apparently did not know their 
attackers, and they said the attack was not gang-related.

CHARGES ARE DISMISSED FOR 8 IN CITIZEN'S ARREST CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trespassing charges were dismissed Friday against eight day laborers because 
prosecutors determined that the men were not trying to hinder business when 
they were placed under citizen's arrest by merchants at a Costa Mesa shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who had all been standing in the mall parking area seeking daywork, 
were placed under arrest on separate days in February and March by the owner 
and the manager of the Vista Shopping Center at 19th Street and Placentia 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The shopkeepers had alleged that the men were loitering, harassing customers 
and obstructing business at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
But after reviewing the cases, prosecutors decided that there was no evidence 
the men intended to interfere with business. 
</P>
<P>
The trespassing laws under which the men were charged carry a requirement that 
a person must enter a property with the intention of obstructing or interfering 
with the rights of the owner, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephan Sauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem of Identification 
</P>
<P>
Sauer also said the store owner had indicated that he might not be able to 
identify particular defendants as being the men he told not to trespass. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing the men praised the prosecutors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really pleased that it worked out this way," said Deborah Carrillo, an 
Orange County public defender. "I was worried that if this did end up going to 
trial, the men would miss a lot of work, which might be just an inconvenience 
for you or me, but for them would be very serious." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the owner nor the manager of the shopping center could be reached for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The mall has long been a gathering point for day laborers. Merchants had 
complained to police and city officials for years about loitering, littering 
and other problems they attributed to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Some immigrants' rights groups had expressed fear that the tactic of placing 
the workers under citizen's arrest for trespassing or on other charges would be 
used as a weapon to harass the laborers. But Carrillo said use of trespassing 
laws and citizen's arrests is not likely to spread. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it gave the merchants a taste of the criminal justice system and how 
it works; and it illustrated that these are not criminal justice problems," she 
said. "I doubt that any more arrests under these conditions will be made." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
24 Arrested Thursday 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service on Thursday arrested 
24 people suspected of being illegal immigrants during early morning sweeps in 
Costa Mesa. Those arrested included an unspecified number seized in the parking 
lot of the Vista Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Other people were arrested at 20th Street and Santa Ana Avenue, and 18th Street 
and Park Boulevard, near Lion's Park, which has been a frequent gathering spot 
for day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
INS spokesman Don Brechtel said the sweeps were prompted by "rising numbers of 
undocumented workers in the area." 
</P>
<P>
"The Costa Mesa sites are a few of many throughout Los Angeles and Orange 
counties that we have been monitoring continually,"Brechtel said. "Because of 
the effectiveness of employer sanctions, the number of these informal labor 
sites has increased, (Lion's) park being the most serious area. We will 
continue to enforce federal laws at these locations."

BIG MARCH FIGURES TO BE FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For her 60th birthday present last year, Molly Lyon of Newport Beach was given 
a party with 70 friends at the Four Seasons Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she requested something completely different -- a trip to Washington 
with her daughter so they could walk together at Sunday's March for Women's 
Equality/Women's Lives sponsored by the National Organization for Women. More 
than a mere present from her husband, Leon, the trip represents "an affirmation 
of my life as a political activist and human being," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to send a very strong message to the Supreme Court and Congress," 
Lyon said. "Women are not going to let Roe vs. Wade be overturned. We're not." 
</P>
<P>
Spurred on by the impending U.S. Supreme Court consideration of a test case on 
abortion and angered by recent blockades of family planning clinics by radical 
anti-abortionists, about 40 marchers from Orange County -- including several 
first-time activists and six mother/child teams -- began leaving this week for 
what is expected to be the largest-ever march for women's rights. Organizers 
are predicting more than 200,000 marchers from around the world -- many more 
than the 90,000 who turned out for a March, 1986, pro-choice rally in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A local sympathy rally will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Santa Ana Civic 
Center at Civic Center Drive and Flower Street. 
</P>
<P>
"There never has been a time that was as impressive and dangerous as it is 
now," said Myra Brown, 69, a retired social worker from Newport Beach, who will 
be marching for women's rights for the first time along with her daughter, Lea 
Ann Brown, 39, of Berkeley. "One gets lulled into thinking things are safe." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she said: "I thought it would be exciting and fun and important. What 
the hell. I'm an old lady, I might as well go and do what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Schwarz, 27, a film producer in Los Angeles, will join his mother, Linda 
Schwarz of Santa Ana, for his first march. "I get chills thinking about it. 
It'll feel good to be around half a million people who believe like you do -- 
especially growing up in Orange County in a fairly conservative neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Local marchers say they want not only to preserve reproduction rights for 
future generations, but also to demonstrate that Orange County is not as 
conservative as its reputation suggests. 
</P>
<P>
A Times Orange County poll in January showed that 60% of Orange County 
residents opposed the U.S. Supreme Court barring abortions except in the case 
of a threat to a mother's life. In general, Orange County residents are more 
liberal on the abortion issue than the rest of the country, according to UC 
Irvine professor Mark Baldassare's annual Orange County Survey. 
</P>
<P>
While members of the local contingent belong to Women For, NOW, Planned 
Parenthood, California Abortion Rights Action League (CARAL) or the American 
Civil Liberties Union, most said they planned to march as a group under a 
banner "Orange County California Women for Pro-Choice," another of Lyon's 
birthday presents. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to let Orange County know, and the rest of the nation know, we are not 
this Republican bastion where everyone thinks alike," said Cathy Jensen, 
president of the Orange County chapter of the ACLU, who will be marching with 
her 19-year-old daughter, Chris, and her 12-year-old son, Jeffrey. "We really 
are a stronghold of liberal leadership unparalleled in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon said women friends, afraid of publicly expressing their convictions, have 
told her privately: "Go there for me Molly. March for me." Those who told her 
that, she said, expressed fear that their husbands' careers would suffer by 
association with such liberal social views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Republicans for Choice 
</P>
<P>
A group called California Republicans for Choice also will send a contingent, 
according to Arlene Sontag, 54, of Anaheim Hills, president of the South Orange 
County YWCA and a self-described liberal Republican, who will march. "I just 
don't see government telling you what to do with your own body," she said. 
"This goes along with the Republican philosophy of less government. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody favors abortion," she said. "It's not a solution. Education is the 
solution. But choice is the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Marchers will stay in hotels or with friends; some plan to tour the city today. 
The 2-mile march at noon Sunday will begin at the Washington Monument, continue 
up Constitution Avenue and pass the U.S. Supreme Court to the Capitol, where a 
rally will be held in the afternoon. Many will wear white, the suffragettes' 
symbol of unity, and carry banners identifying their group. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, a group led by activist Wendy Lozano, a women's studies lecturer at Cal 
State Long Beach, plans to lobby Orange County legislators to stop adding 
anti-abortion amendments to unrelated bills and to support an Equal Rights 
Amendment that was reintroduced this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed to Abortion Issue 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Washington march was aimed at garnering support for the ERA. 
But organizers said the increase in the efforts of abortion opponents, 
including President Bush, turned it into a primarily pro-choice event. In 
January, soon after his inauguration, Bush offered encouragement by telephone 
to about 67,000 anti-abortionists gathered for a rally outside the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The rapidly rising enthusiasm for pro-choice activism is unprecedented in 
Orange County, activists said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, during the blockades of family-planning clinics by the 
anti-abortion Operation Rescue in Orange County and elsewhere in Southern 
California, "our phone rang and rang and rang; we couldn't answer all the calls 
from women asking what we can do to help," said Donna Phelan, 56, a secretary 
for Planned Parenthood in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday in Washington, Phelan said she will march for the first time since 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's more than a women's issue; it's a civil rights issue," said Linda 
Schwarz, Orange County liaison for CARAL. She called abortion the "tip of the 
iceberg" on the agenda of certain religious groups. "We had a President who 
gave them a stronger voice, saying, 'It's OK, it's OK,' to these people. And 
these people feel now the time is right. (They say,) 'We can impose our view on 
the country.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pill Issue 
</P>
<P>
"We've never done that to them, but they feel they can do it to us," Schwarz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marchers acknowledged that their demonstration comes at a time when the issue 
could become moot through the presence of an abortifacient pill, RU486, which 
has become available in France. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, however, said the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court's test case from Missouri 
due for oral arguments later this month may include a ruling on when life 
begins, something that could outlaw the pill in the United States. In that 
case, "women's groups would smuggle it in," she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ACLU's Jensen, "There will be civil disobedience if the court 
makes an unwise decision." If abortions become illegal, she predicted that 
women will train themselves to perform their own abortions as they did in the 
past. "Don't think we're going to go to men to be butchered in back alleys." 
</P>
<P>
Sontag said: "We've said we'll chain ourselves to the White House gates." 
</P>
<P>
Some family members marching together said they hoped that their participation 
in the demonstration would have benefits beyond the issue of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Lyon's daughter, Linda Othenin-Girard, 38, of Los Angeles, a former 
anti-war activist at UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara, said: "It's very special 
because we're doing it together. . . . It makes me reflect on what we have in 
common, our 'womanness,' which isn't something that necessarily comes out as a 
child, an adolescent, or even an adult." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Standing Together' 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said: "I really think children should understand the power of standing 
together. They can see that each of us individually can make a difference. And 
when we join with other people, we can make a bigger difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite an experience to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with people who chose 
this issue to link arms, whether they are men or women, old or young, whether 
they've personally done this, or personally (are) fortunate not to have had to 
make this choice." 
</P>
<P>
She added: 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the outcome of that Supreme Court decision, choice and the 
freedom to express ideas will be stronger for the fact we went."

SCHOOL PRACTICES BEFORE QUAKE HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lightning may not strike twice, but Friday marked the second time that a quake 
had rumbled through Stone Creek Elementary School in Irvine on a day when 
pupils were involved in an earthquake preparedness drill. 
</P>
<P>
Just before dawn on March 11 last year, the same day school officials had 
planned a drill, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.7 rolled through the area. 
Scientists said it was an aftershock of the October, 1987, Whittier quake that 
claimed eight lives. Stone Creek officials went ahead with their drill, said 
Principal Marilyn Boyd, with the lessons of real life fresh in the students' 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, students staged another drill at 8:45 a.m., and later that day, real 
life imitated play, a twist on last year's lesson. An earthquake registering 
4.6 scared the children, but the earlier drill probably kept them from 
panicking, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about a coincidence," said Linda Smith, a clerk at the school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Kind of a Joke' 
</P>
<P>
"The students said, 'This happened last year, Mrs. Boyd,' " the principal said. 
"It was kind of a joke. Somebody knows when we have earthquake drills. We're 
all going to be a little skeptical about drills next year. But there was no 
panic here." 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County school officials gave their students high marks for the way 
they behaved during Friday's quake, preparedness did not mask the fear that 
some students felt. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some children come up now after it was all over, who were scared," 
Smith said. "Luckily, our nurse was here today, because some children said 
their stomachs were upset, some were crying. But it's not mass hysteria. A few 
came up and wanted to know about mother and father who might work in Long Beach 
or some other city. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to reassure them that here was the hardest, because it was the center," 
she said. "We tell them they felt what we felt." 
</P>
<P>
Students in Orange County schools closest to the coast felt Friday's quake the 
most. The only real damage was reported at Corona del Mar High School in 
Newport Beach, where students were told to go home after the quake because of 
officials' fear that falling ceiling tiles could contain harmful asbestos, 
according to Newport-Mesa Unified School District Supt. John W. Nicoll. Cracks 
formed in the gymnasium walls and in several classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But the district plans to work over the weekend to clean up the debris in time 
to reopen the school on Monday morning, Nicoll said. Experts were scheduled to 
assess the asbestos danger Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"If what happened to us is characteristic of what happened to everyone else, 
that's not so bad," he said. "It was a sharp quake, but a relatively harmless 
one." 
</P>
<P>
One secretary at the district office was hit on the back of her neck by a clock 
that fell off the wall and hit her as she was in the process of crawling under 
her desk, Nicoll said, and five students throughout the district were hit by 
"flying things -- books, other randomly described pieces of debris," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one was hospitalized, there were no paramedics, no blood." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in several schools said frequent drills have made "duck and cover" 
reactions almost second nature for students living in an area that has been 
rocking and rolling with frequency, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"People dove under the desks," said Laguna Beach Unified School Dist. Supt. 
Dennis Smith, who was at Thurston Middle School when the quake struck. "We have 
worked real hard on disaster relief. . . . We have preparations in place, and 
(the students) responded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I dove under, too, under a table. Quickly. I beat everybody there. I may 
not be from California, but I learn very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Bressler, office manager for Mariners Elementary School in Newport Beach, 
said that after Friday's jolt students sat outside on the lawn, as they had 
been instructed, and drank from gallon jugs of water that had been set aside 
specifically for earthquake disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Bressler said the school's PTA had provided disaster kits that contained food, 
water, Gatoraid, blankets, paper cups and radios packed up for a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Every student in this school has an earthquake lunch," she said. "We also have 
a portable toilet all set up." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's quake, which caused scattered damage and no serious injuries, helped 
convince students of the importance of drills, officials said. Because April is 
earthquake preparedness month, several schools in the county have planned 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach Union High School District, Jimmie Sharrit, public safety 
manager, said an earthquake safety drill has been planned for April 19 that 
will involve police, schools and other agencies in the cities of Huntington 
Beach, Westminster and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very timely to have the earthquake today," she said. "It's really been 
very motivational. And we didn't even schedule it." 
</P>
<P>
Buildings in her district sustained no damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Played Role of Injured 
</P>
<P>
At the Stone Creek drill, students played the role of injured quake victims, 
with teachers or other staff members carrying them out in stretchers to an area 
designated as the first aid station. Other students moved away from the 
building to practice avoiding falling debris. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us only 30 minutes to evacuate this morning, even with 25 injured 
people including those who had to be brought out on stretchers," Boyd said. "We 
also had the walking wounded." 
</P>
<P>
During the real earthquake Friday afternoon, the school's 530 students 
evacuated in about two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But that was not until the earth had stopped moving, Boyd said. The first 
lesson of the disaster drill requires students to head for the space under 
their desks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the next order of business is to account for all the students, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand on top of a hill overlooking the school and make sure all the classes 
are accounted for," she said. "The teachers hand me a sheet of all the students 
who are not accounted for. They have to get out (of the buildings) with 
everyone they can get out with." 
</P>
<P>
The students went through the real life earthquake like pros, the officials 
said, but it was later that some of them showed their apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the students were a little nervous and frightened, but I think they 
were less frightened (than if the school had not had a drill)," Boyd said. 'Our 
theme this year is 'Be prepared, not scared,' so that's what we do."

PREPARING YOUR HOME FOR AN EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keep survival items, including: a portable radio, flashlights, extra batteries, 
a first-aid kit and medicines, an adjustable wrench for turning off water and 
gas lines, a few gallons of bottled water for each family member, chlorine 
bleach to disinfect water (eight to 16 drops per gallon), a week's supply of 
canned and dried foods, a portable stove, matches, extra blankets or sleeping 
bags, and phone numbers for local police and fire departments and your doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Check your home for earthquake hazards. Bolt down or provide strong support for 
water heaters and other gas appliances. Place large or heavy objects on lower 
shelves. Brace or anchor tall or top-heavy items. Securely fasten shelves to 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Conduct occasional drills to help family members avoid injury and panic during 
quakes. Teach family members first aid and how to turn off gas, electricity and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Have a plan to reunite your family if travel is difficult or restricted. 
</P>
<P>
DURING AN EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
<P>
Remain calm. Reassure others. 
</P>
<P>
If indoors, watch for falling plaster, bricks, light fixtures and other 
objects. If you are in danger, get under a table, desk or bed. Stay away from 
windows, mirrors and chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
If outside, avoid walls, power poles and other objects that could fall. Move to 
an open area if possible. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
<P>
Provide first aid to injured people, but do not move them unless they are in 
immediate danger of further injury. 
</P>
<P>
Check for fires or fire hazards. Check utilities and appliances for damage. If 
you smell gas, shut off the main valve, open windows, leave the house and 
notify your utility. Do not use matches, electrical switches or open flame 
appliances unless you are sure there is no leak. Shut off electric power if 
household wiring is damaged, but only if no gas leak is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Wear shoes if there is broken glass or other debris. 
</P>
<P>
Do not touch downed power lines or objects they may touch. 
</P>
<P>
If water is off, get emergency water from water heaters, toilet tanks, melted 
ice cubes or canned foods. Avoid eating or drinking anything from open 
containers near shattered glass. 
</P>
<P>
Don't go sightseeing in damaged areas or on beaches where tidal waves may 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared for aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor emergency broadcasts on your television or portable radio. 
</P>
<P>
Check your chimney for cracks or damage, but approach cautiously. Do not use 
your phone except to report fire, gas, medical or violent-crime emergencies.

Look for books, potted plants and heavy objects that could fall and injure 
someone during an earthquake. Move or secure them. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy objects, such as computer terminals and top-heavy furniture, may be a 
threat. If they aren't secured, be ready to move away from them in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Be ready to move away from windows and glass partitions that can break in an 
earthquake.

<P>
Store emergency supplies. In a desk drawer keep: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A portable radio for information after a disaster; 
</P>
<P>
 -- A flashlight in the event power fails; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tennis shoes for ease of movement; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food, such as trail mix; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bottled water in the event water lines break; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Medicines and first-aid items; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Emergency literature that gives information on actions to take in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Know emergency procedures, including the locations of: 
</P>
<P>

EL DORADO GATHERING MOMENTUM

<P>
Steve Gullotti, El Dorado High School baseball coach, pointed to a small mound 
of dirt about 10 feet outside the Golden Hawks' dugout and proclaimed that the 
freshly dug grave held all the trappings of his team's past. 
</P>
<P>
"We buried the past right here," Gullotti said. "The players tossed in old 
wristbands, batting gloves and even a helmet. The idea was to bury the past 
rather than have it come back to haunt us." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado, a favorite to win the Empire League title, pushed aside the memory 
of a mediocre 2-2 start in league play Friday by defeating rival Esperanza, 
5-1, in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Jay Hassel (1-0) allowed only two hits after relieving starter Matt 
Luke in the second inning to gain his first victory in three years. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Hassel has been sidelined with major knee and ankle 
injuries that have kept him out of uniform for the entire season. Hassel, a 
lanky right-hander, struck out five and received two sparkling plays by right 
fielder Greg Fife in the seventh inning to keep Esperanza (6-5-3, 0-4-1) 
winless in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay did a great job," Gullotti said. "The best thing he did was throw strikes. 
He threw his curveball with confidence and went right after them." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado (11-5, 3-2) scored the only runs Hassel needed in the second inning, 
taking advantage of a throwing error by losing pitcher Greg Hauser (2-3) that 
allowed Travis Dowdell and Tim Walker to score. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado added three more runs on three hits in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza scored its only run on a second-inning homer by catcher Keith 
McDonald that carried well over the 345-foot sign in right-center field. The 
Aztecs had only four hits and made two errors. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza has qualified for the playoffs in six consecutive seasons, advancing 
to the large-schools championship game the past three years. But the Aztecs 
appear to be going nowhere this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a bad team, but we're struggling," said Mike Curran, Esperanza 
coach. "We're not hitting and we're not fielding, and you're not going to win 
too many games that way. Hopefully, we'll get better, but it's getting awfully 
late." 
</P>
<P>
Loara 10, Katella 8 (8 innings) -- Matt Drager hit a two-run homer with two 
outs in the bottom of the eighth to give the Saxons (6-9, 3-2) the victory. 
Katella tied the score, 8-8, with three runs in the top of the sixth. Jessie 
Evans had a two-run single in the inning. Loara scored five in the fifth, two 
on a single by Rusty Tamblyn. Billy Fitzgerald had two hits and three RBIs for 
Katella (8-5, 4-1). 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 11, Cypress 7 -- Brian Havens' grand slam in the fourth pulled Los 
Alamitos into a 4-4 tie and the Griffins added another run and never trailed 
again at Cypress. Los Alamitos (3-2 in league play) added two in the fifth and 
four in the sixth to break the game open. Cypress (3-6-3, 1-3-1) was led by 
Kevin Smith, who was three for four.

Dave Jacobson hit a third-inning home run as Trabuco Hills High School defeated 
Laguna Hills, 1-0, in a Pacific Coast League game Friday at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson's homer, one of six hits allowed by losing pitcher Ron Kortman (5-1), 
supported the pitching of David Lowery (5-1), who struck out 10 and scattered 
six hits to record the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best game Lowery has pitched this year," said Trabuco Hills Coach 
Don Munsell, whose team improved to 8-3 overall and 5-0 in league play. "There 
were times when he overthrew the ball, but each time, he settled down and got 
back on his groove. I don't see anyone better than him in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Said Laguna Hills Coach Jack Hodges: "He was getting a lot of calls that I 
didn't think were strikes, but you have to give him credit. In a pitching duel 
like we were in today, you have to play the little ball well, and we didn't 
play the little ball well." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills (12-4, 4-1), which was ranked first in Orange County this week, 
had its best scoring chance in the bottom of the first inning when Lowery hit 
one batter and allowed two hits to load the bases with two out. But Lowery 
ended the inning by getting Kortman to pop out to third. AL PRESTON

TROY SCORES 7 RUNS IN FIRST, HOLDS OFF SUNNY HILLS, 9-6

<P>
Troy High School has had bigger innings than the first inning it produced on 
Friday against Sunny Hills in a Freeway League game. But none have come with as 
much at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the biggest team win that we've had all year," said Troy starter Tom 
Wilson, the winning pitcher in a 9-6 victory over visiting Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was for first place (in league), and if we won it, we're tied for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's ability to maneuver through the first two innings by getting all six 
outs on strikeouts, and the Warriors' offensive outburst helped place them in a 
three-way tie for the league lead. Troy (9-4 overall), Sunny Hills (10-6) and 
Fullerton are tied for first place with 4-1 league records. 
</P>
<P>
It also was Troy's second highest run total in an inning this season (the 
Warriors scored 11 runs on March 22 in a 15-3 victory over Garden Grove.). 
</P>
<P>
"When you have 10 games left, it kind of boils down to (just) another game," 
Troy Coach Dan Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is significant for us because we played well after the last game (a 
loss to Fullerton on Wednesday) and it showed we can play with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors might not have had much to show had it not been for Wilson, who 
pitched seven innings to earn the victory and keep his record perfect at 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills starter Brent Smith lasted just two-thirds of an inning before 
being replaced by Jeff Kight. The Warriors sent 13 batters to the plate in the 
first inning, and all seven runs were scored with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Smith) was totally out of sync," said Sunny Hills Coach Doug Elliott. "He 
couldn't get his curveball over and had to go with the fastball, and before we 
knew it, they had seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
"(That first inning) killed us," Elliott said. "It was the ballgame." DENNIS

SAN CLEMENTE SOPHOMORE TIM MARTIN HAS RAPIDLY EMERGED AS PROLIFIC SPRINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Figuring something had to be wrong, San Clemente High School track and field 
Coach Bill Hartman stared down at his stopwatch last month and asked himself: 
</P>
<P>
Is this really happening? 
</P>
<P>
Could Tim Martin, his fast-improving sophomore sprinter, actually have just run 
the 100-meter dash in 10.6 seconds? On a dirt track? In practice? 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches and I just kept looking at our watches," Hartman said. "We thought 
maybe we had jumped the gun a bit. But he kept doing it." 
</P>
<P>
What Martin did, and continues to do, is run faster than any San Clemente 
sprinter ever has. Not just in practice, but in competition. Major competition. 
</P>
<P>
A quick look back: 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 11, at the Bronco Invitational at Cal Poly Pomona: Martin, who was 
placed in an unseeded heat because his previous 100-meter best (11.0 as a 
freshman) wasn't fast enough for the seeded heat -- tore away from the field 
and won in a hand-timed 10.5, the fastest time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
With the mark, Martin not only erased San Clemente's school record of 10.7 set 
by Rick Geddes in 1967, but he also tied the meet record set last year by L.A. 
Washington's Brian Bridgewater. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgewater, now competing at Long Beach College, was the fastest prep sprinter 
in the nation last year at 200 meters (20.53), and was among the top 15 
100-meter men in the nation as well. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Martin's 10.5 mark -- actually 10.74 when converted to electronic 
or fully automatic timing -- comes fairly close to the Orange County record of 
10.57 set by Santa Ana Valley's Elliot Dunning in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
On Martin's performance, Bronco meet director Jim Sackett said: "There wasn't 
any wind, there wasn't anyone close to him. He is definitely for real." 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 16, at a triangular meet against Laguna Hills and Mayfair on San 
Clemente's sandy dirt track: Martin was faced with his first serious challenge 
in Mayfair's Erik Mitchell, who, as a sophomore last year, won the Southern 
Section 2-A 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
First, Martin caught and outsprinted Mitchell on the anchor leg of the 
400-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hartman: "All you saw at the finish was Tim's shoulder (hitting the tape 
first) and Erik's eyeballs wide as could be. Erik couldn't believe he got 
beat." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Martin outsprinted Mitchell in the 100 meters. Finally, Martin edged him 
in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the meet, Erik Mitchell didn't know who Tim Martin was," Hartman said. 
"But once the meet was over, I don't think Erik Mitchell will ever forget him." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:35, Martin will line up beside Mitchell again in the men's 
invitational 100 meters at the Arcadia Invitational at Arcadia High School. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, in its 22nd year, is one of the most prestigious high school meets in 
the country. Athletes scheduled to compete will travel from 15 states outside 
of California: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New 
York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin 
and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Although the invitational 100 meters is loaded with talent -- entrants include 
Oakland's Jeff Laynes, who is the national leader at 10.53; Colorado's Albert 
Ransom, the second-fastest 100-meter returnee in the nation at 10.43; and San 
Francisco Mission's Barry Smith, the third-fastest 100-meter returnee at 10.49 
-- Martin should find the competition just as tough in the invitational 
200-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
There, along with Smith and Laynes, Martin, will line up beside Hawthorne's 
Curtis Conway. Martin has heard plenty about Conway, a standout quarterback, 
and one of the top sprinters in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of him. All about him actually," Martin said. "A lot of people are 
trying to get me scared. They say, 'You're going against Conway?' "But I just 
laugh. I just say, 'Hey, I'm not gonna worry about it. At least not until I get 
up there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been told of Arcadia's prestige and the fact that college 
coaches come from across the nation to observe potential recruits, Martin seems 
fairly nonchalant about the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach keeps telling me people are coming as far as New York and stuff," Martin 
said. "So I guess they must be pretty fast. But I'm not really worried or 
anything. I'm not nervous, all I can do is my best." 
</P>
<P>
Nonchalance, or naivete? 
</P>
<P>
"Tim has no idea what this meet is like," Hartman said. "And he doesn't really 
realize how good he is. He has no real idea what he's doing or the gift he 
has." 
</P>
<P>
Said Martin, 16: "I don't know if I'm successful. I just run (with) what I 
got." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, whose father, George, is an 18-year U.S. Marine officer, currently 
lives at the Camp Pendleton Marine base. Martin, who was born in Vancouver, 
British Columbia, has lived in Marine bases from Portland, Ore., to Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
When the family moved here three years ago, Martin had little background in 
sports, other than playing soccer at Kubasaki High School in Okinawa. He joined 
the Triton track and field team as a freshman, and, despite the fact that he 
says he just hates to practice, Martin has been quickly improving. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his immediate goals, Martin said: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I wouldn't mind getting to the Olympics, but right now I just got to 
take it one step at a time. Right now, I just want to win at Arcadia, that's my 
main concern." 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia notes 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Allison Franke, the third-best returning discus thrower in the nation 
at 158-4, will meet her two top rivals in that event: junior Melisa Weis 
(163-0) and the nation's best, Dawn Dumble (170-11), both from Bakersfield. . . 
. In the men's 1,600 meters, El Modena's Joe Komarinski, Mater Dei's Mike 
Nielsen and Corona del Mar's Greg Shryock will face some tough competition in 
Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle, who leads the Southern Section with a time of 
4:16 . . . In the men's shotput, Edison's powerful duo of Greg Thurston and 
Lamont Peay will try to pick up where their former teammate, 1988 state and 
Arcadia champion Kaleaph Carter, left off. . . . Other county athletes 
scheduled to compete include: Dana Hills' Mike Tansley, University's Erin Vali 
and Laguna Hills' Tony Gibney in the boys' 3,200; University's Tanja Brix, San 
Clemente's Terri Smythers and Santa Ana Valley's Maria Vargas in the girls' 
3,200; and Edison's Shelley Taylor and Santa Ana Valley's Teresa Beltran in the 
1,600. . . . Corona del Mar and Mission Viejo will battle it out in the girls' 
seeded 1,600 relay, while Woodbridge competes in the invitational 1,600 girls' 
relay.

banquet Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos averaged 21 points game for the Titans, who were 16-13 this season, 
and Jones averaged 12 points and seven rebounds after recovering from critical 
gun-shot wounds suffered in a drive-by shooting in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill, who set a school record with 75 three-point baskets, was honored 
with the three-point award.

Other awards were given to Randal Moos (academics), Wayne Williams (assist 
leader with 5.2 a game), and Van Anderson (most inspirational). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton honored Gary and Linda Calvin, Brent Calvin's parents, as fans of the 
year. Calvin was given the coaches' award. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Bowen, a 6-foot-6 guard from Fresno Edison, was at the banquet and said 
he has committed to Fullerton. He averaged 20 points for Edison, which lost to 
Crenshaw in the state Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Dareck Crane, a 6-3 guard who averaged 18.1 points a game for Orange Coast last 
season, also said Friday that he has committed to Fullerton.

PHOTOGRAPHERS' MURAL TO DOCUMENT CANYON CHANGES IN 40,000 PICTURES

Jerry Burchfield and Mark Chamberlain are photographers who want to build a 
mural 600 feet long that would trail off into the wilderness of Laguna Canyon 
-- made entirely of snapshots. Forty thousand snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield and Chamberlain are calling it "The Tell," the archeological term 
for buried artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Several obstacles already have been overcome -- raising the money to build it, 
insurance, coordination with the Laguna Beach City Council, coordination with 
the California Department of Transportation. And they have picked a date -- May 
1 -- for the construction to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Another 20,000 photos are still needed, however. (Got any? Burchfield and 
Chamberlain are accepting shots of anything, in color or in black and white.) 
The photographers are confident that they will get them, though. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much energy to stop it now," Chamberlain said of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, which would stay up through Sept. 30, is the eighth of 10 phases of 
Burchfield and Chamberlain's "Laguna Canyon Project: The Continuous Documentary 
1980-1990." 
</P>
<P>
"We started documenting Laguna Canyon because of a particular fondness for the 
location," said Burchfield, who teaches photography at Cypress College. "Its 
unique rural nature separates Laguna Beach from the rest of the more congested 
urban Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
"We felt," however, he said, "that some sort of development was inevitable. As 
photographers, we believed that we might not play a role in stopping the 
development. So the least we could do was use our craft to document the 
environment so that there is a record of it. We decided to show the change over 
a length of time." 
</P>
<P>
The project began in 1980 when they photographed Laguna Canyon Road from one 
end to the other. But "the only places these photographs were seen was in a 
museum or gallery," Burchfield said. "They were seen only by a select audience, 
people who had an interest in the fine arts. Yet the issues relating to the 
environment, and the development of it, can touch a much broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are intimidated by museums or galleries," Burchfield went on, 
"because they are not sure what art is all about. They're not sure that they 
can relate to it. (A lot of art is done for people who are already involved in 
the arts.) The line between art and everyday living isn't as broad as people 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield and Chamberlain figured that the rural Sycamore Hill area of Laguna 
Canyon is about as far from a museum or gallery as it is possible to get, so 
they decided to build their mural there. 
</P>
<P>
It will vary in height from about 25 feet closest to the road to about 2 feet 
at the other end. The idea is that, seen from the road, it will look as though 
it trails off into infinity. 
</P>
<P>
A parking area will be provided so that viewers can get out of their cars and 
really look at the snapshots. They could see someone they know, perhaps even 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The photos will be arranged, Burchfield said, so as to connect "symbolic images 
into a narrative" with "references to the change from prehistoric to 
contemporary time." They also will be coordinated by hue and tone so as to 
evoke various moods. Burchfield and Chamberlain are using a computer to help 
them sort through the contributions, most of them from Orange County, they have 
received so far. The sizes of the contributions have varied, they said. Some 
people send just a few shots while others send shopping bags and even boxes 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to contribute snapshots to "The Tell" can drop them off before 
April 22 at: the photo gallery on the second floor of the Cypress College 
Technical Education Building; Room 285 in the Fine Arts Complex at Cal State 
Fullerton; or to the photography gallery in the Fine Arts Building at Orange 
Coast College; Cal's Camera, 1770 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa; Cypress Photo-Art, 
6177 Ball Road, Cypress; BC Space Gallery, 235 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach.

BRITNY FOX: A HIGH-VOLTAGE ROCK GROUP WITH A KISS OF METAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF ZEIGLER, The Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philadelphia's Britny Fox may look like your average heavy metal band, but the 
quartet has more on its mind than the usual heavy metal themes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more hard rock than heavy metal," lead guitarist Michael Kelly Smith 
said during a recent telephone interview. "You can hear a lot of influences 
from AC-DC and Kiss, but we have developed our own style." 
</P>
<P>
The group's self-titled first release contains messages about helping out your 
fellow man -- unusual for hard rock -- but Smith is quick to point out that the 
band is not ready for the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to preach anything. If you read the lyrics, we have a 
message," Smith said, "but we don't base ourselves on that type of thing. We 
aren't trying to tell you what to do or what not to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The song 'Save the Weak' is saying to take a look around you and realize how 
good you might have it because a lot of people are less fortunate than us. 
Appreciate what you have," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Another song, "Rock Revolution," deals with censorship in rock and pop music, a 
subject that Smith holds a hard line against. "That ("Rock Revolution") is 
about the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) and how stupid it is," Smith 
said. "Hard-rock bands always get the bad rap. They (the PMRC) act as though 
that is the worst thing going on in the world. It's OK to put violence on TV, 
but you can't have explicit lyrics. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Despite its recent success, Britny Fox has also had its share of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
When the band first formed, its members figured its lineup was set with Dean 
Davidson on vocals and rhythm guitar, Billy Childs on bass and former 
Cinderella members Smith on lead guitar and Tony Destra on the drums. But 
Destra was killed in an automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big blow and a real setback, but we wanted to carry on for his sake," 
Smith said. "He wouldn't have wanted us to quit. Things were going good, we had 
record company interests. We went too far to quit." The band pressed on and 
replaced Destra with Johnny Dee. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Britny Fox, which derives its name from Davidson's 18th-Century 
ancestry, has plans for a new album: "We plan on going into the studio this 
summer. The record should be out by the fall or the end of the year. We have 
songs left over from the last album's sessions, plus we've been working on 
material since then."

ROUGHING IT; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SUBURBIA IS SPRAWLING TO WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Getting away from it all" is the battle cry of campers everywhere, but escape 
is not always easy at some of Orange County's more popular camping areas, where 
the trappings of suburbia can prove hard to shake. 
</P>
<P>
At O'Neill Regional Park, once an isolated slice of backcountry, the view from 
sites in the upper Mesa Campground now includes the suburban back yards of the 
Rancho Santa Margarita development. Campers pitch tents and build fires within 
a stone's throw of $300,000 homes on the other side of a chain-link fence that 
is topped by strands of barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
Featherly Regional Park along the county's last "wild" stretch of the Santa Ana 
River has been cut in half by construction of a mammoth freeway overpass, while 
campers at San Clemente State Beach are more likely to be lulled to sleep by 
the roar of Interstate 5 than by crashing waves. 
</P>
<P>
But even if these parks do not provide a pure wilderness experience, they do 
offer some measure of escape. More than 378,000 people camped at the county's 
state parks and beaches last year (with another 117,000 at San Onofre State 
Beach, just south of the San Diego County line); more than 159,000 campers used 
facilities at the county's regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
"We do provide a needed service for a lot of people here in Orange County," 
said Richard Dyer, O'Neill's supervising ranger. "There are an awful lot of 
working people who can't get in the car for 4 or 5 days" to camp in such 
outdoor meccas as Sequoia and Yosemite national parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Within an hour or less, they have a camping experience," Dyer said. "They cook 
outdoors; they sleep in a tent; they go for hikes." 
</P>
<P>
The camping experience at O'Neill, however, is being diluted by the county's 
continuing growth. There is no buffer between the park and new residential 
development near its upper section, leading increasingly to conflicts. The park 
receives complaints almost daily from neighbors over noise, smoke from 
campfires and aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents in expensive neighborhoods simply don't like living close enough 
to see people camping, Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
While some campers still enjoy camping on the ridge because of the sweeping 
views that remain to the north and east, others increasingly object to pitching 
their tents in view of the tract homes. "I don't blame them," Dyer said. "I 
don't camp in areas like this." 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from neighbors have already forced the closing of 40 sites in Mesa 
Campground. Dyer fears that all camping in the upper park may have to end. 
</P>
<P>
Below the ridgeline, the homes in Rancho Santa Margarita are out of sight, so 
the park remains much as it has for years. Oaks and sycamores still spread 
their leaves over campsites, hiking trails and picnic grounds, while Saddleback 
towers in the distance. The Trabuco Creek Trail, which winds through the lush 
vegetation on the hillside above Trabuco Creek, remains one of the best short 
nature walks in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Featherly Regional Park, likewise, has retained much of its charm in the face 
of less-than-ideal conditions. But these days, fewer visitors are enjoying the 
camping-only park's stands of cottonwood and sycamore, which make up a rich 
riparian habitat that has dwindled to almost nothing elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit at Featherly is a towering freeway overpass, being built to help 
ease congestion on the nightmarish Riverside Freeway through Santa Ana Canyon. 
The work is expected to continue through the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Many park regulars think the park is closed because of the construction. "It's 
not true; we're here," said Linda McKelvie, the park's secretary. "We have a 
very nice camping park." 
</P>
<P>
Featherly Park has lost just two campsites to the project, but daytime noise 
has increased somewhat, in addition to noise already generated by the nearby 
freeway. But McKelvie said the park is still "a nice place to camp" and has 
many new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The third county regional park that offers camping has problems of a different 
nature. The threat of cougar attacks -- two have occurred in recent years -- 
has led the county to make camping at Caspers Regional Park off limits to 
minors. Visitors must be 18 or older to enjoy the park's campgrounds and 
wilderness trails. 
</P>
<P>
While that is bad news for families, the wilderness preserve's 7,600 acres 
offer an excellent camping opportunity for adults, with drive-in and equestrian 
camping available. 
</P>
<P>
So far, development has not encroached on the area, although there was 
controversy recently over construction of a medical research facility on county 
land surrounded by the park. (Despite opposition from environmentalists, a 
ruling last October finally cleared the way for construction of the Nichols 
Institute Reference Laboratory, a 100-acre biomedical research facility, at 
this site.) 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county backcountry, opportunities for camping at some of the 
lesser-known parks have increased. Just last month, Crystal Cove State Park 
north of Laguna Beach opened three new off-road environmental campgrounds, two 
for hikers and one for equestrians. Chemical toilets are the only amenities at 
the primitive site; users must even pack their own water. Reservations are 
available through the state's Mistix reservation number: (800) 444-7275. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Hills State Park, opened in 1984, preserves more than 10,000 acres of 
hill country, encompassing parts of four counties. Chino Hills offers 
opportunities for car and equestrian camping, although the sites are not within 
the county. The park's main entrance is in Riverside County, from Pomona Rincon 
Road off the Corona Expressway. For information, call (714) 780-6222. 
</P>
<P>
The National Forest Service operates two of the county's most remote camping 
areas in Cleveland National Forest. Bluejay, 3 miles north of Ortega Highway 
near the Riverside County border, is at 3,400 feet in the chaparral country of 
the Santa Ana Mountains. The nearby Falcon Group Camp has three sites. Both 
seasonal campgrounds will be open May 20 through Labor Day this year. 
</P>
<P>
This year for the first time, half of the campsites at Bluejay and all of the 
Falcon sites may be reserved through the Mistix system. The rest of Bluejay's 
sites will be on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
The county's state beach campgrounds are the most popular of local camping 
areas and are often sold out weeks in advance in spring and summer. The nearest 
beach camping facilities to the north are at Leo Carrillo State Beach south of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Sand and sun -- not solitude -- are the big attractions at these parks, which, 
in addition to local beach-lovers, draw many campers from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches offer "en route" camping. En route 
campsites are day-use parking areas that can be used by self-contained 
trailers, campers or motor homes on an overnight basis. The campsites must be 
vacated by 9 a.m. after a night's stay. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term beach camping is available at Doheny, San Clemente and San Onofre 
state beaches, all of which offer tent sites and hookup sites for trailers, 
campers and motor homes. Walk-in sites were eliminated this year at Doheny and 
San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente State Beach's bluff-top camping area has been taken off the 
state's reservation system, pending a major rehabilitation of the park, with 
work scheduled to begin Tuesday. The park will be open during the yearlong 
project on a first-come, first-served basis, although some campsites will be 
closed at various times during construction. 
</P>
<P>
Doheny State Beach is also scheduled for rehabilitation, but a date has not yet 
been set, so the park remains on the state's Mistix reservation system for the 
time being. Camping at San Onofre is also on the Mistix system. 
</P>
<P>
Campsites can be reserved up to 8 weeks in advance. Weekend dates often sell 
out within a few days after availability. The competition for campsites is 
expected to increase because of San Clemente's removal from the reservation 
system. Camping is in designated campsites only -- no camping is allowed on the 
sand.

FAMILY LIFE: COUNTY SCRAPES FOR FUNDS TO DELIVER PRENATAL CARE TO PREGNANT 
WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody knows that Orange County's population is booming. There are more than 
2.2 million residents now, and by the year 2000, the experts say, that number 
will be 2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
That's the equivalent, roughly, of absorbing the entire population of St. 
Louis, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But before you go out and slap another one of those bumper stickers on your car 
("Welcome to Orange County. Now go home."), consider this: Most of those 
newcomers won't be people from back East, nor will they be immigrants from 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
They will be Orange County natives. 
</P>
<P>
They will be our children. 
</P>
<P>
"Newborn babies already make up the largest proportion of our growth," says 
Orange County 3rd District Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "In the next year, 60% 
of our annual growth rate will be newborns." 
</P>
<P>
The county's figures are in keeping with a national trend. The National Center 
for Health Statistics reported this week that 3.9 million babies were born in 
the United States last year, up 2% from 1987 and the highest number since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County already has the second highest child population in the state, 
Vasquez says, even though it is third in general population. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez is concerned that the county isn't doing as much as it should to 
welcome those new arrivals. More attention should be paid to all the services 
the county provides for children, he says. But in particular, he wants to put 
more resources into prenatal care, helping women -- especially poor women -- go 
through their pregnancies in as healthy a state as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, his fellow Republican, Gov. George Deukmejian, is trying to cut 
back the amount of state money available for those services, even as the demand 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
"We're scraping for dollars," Vasquez says. "We're trying to at least retain 
the amount of money we're already getting." 
</P>
<P>
As medical expenses go, prenatal care is one of the biggest bargains around. 
The woman goes in to see the doctor once a month or so, gets her blood pressure 
and urine checked for signs of trouble and has a routine examination. She gets 
vitamins and guidance on diet and exercise, and a few blood tests along the 
way. The doctor gets to listen to the baby's heartbeat, and so does she. Most 
of the time, nothing goes wrong, but if it does, doctors can intervene right 
away to minimize the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The county will spend about $1.7 million for its public prenatal care services 
this year, about $460,000 of which is county money. About 2,500 patients are 
served by the program, according to Dr. L. Rex Ehling, director of public 
health. That works out to less than 5% of the approximately 45,000 births 
expected in the county this year, he says. 
</P>
<P>
So Orange County is spending about $680 per patient, which is pocket change 
compared to the thousands -- or more -- we have to spend if a child is born 
prematurely, underweight or with other problems that might have been prevented 
with good prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't so expensive to take care of babies before they are born," Ehling 
says. "It's terribly expensive to take care of them after. We've spent more 
than $1 million on some babies, and it's not at all uncommon to have a child 
cost $400,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a uniquely American phenomenon," he says. "We have a great capacity to 
care for these babies that result from poor pregnancy outcome. But we haven't 
really made prenatal care a priority." 
</P>
<P>
But, no matter how much is spent, some of those babies just don't make it. In 
Orange County, 7.6 of every 1,000 infants born in 1987 died before they were a 
year old, according to Ehling. Orange County's infant mortality rate is better 
as a whole that the national rate of 10.4 (the figure for 1986, the most recent 
year for which numbers were available). The state infant mortality rate for 
that same year was 8.9. Ehling credits the county's overall affluence as a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
On the national level, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) has introduced the "Healthy 
Birth Act of 1989" in an attempt to improve both the infant mortality rate and 
prenatal care in general. The bill includes provisions for prenatal handbooks 
and home visits by nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Some women simply don't seek prenatal care. "Sometimes it's a cultural 
situation," Vasquez says. "We have some women who come from areas where 
prenatal care is unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, the mother may be a drug addict for whom the baby's health is 
not a priority, says Lawrence Leaman, the county's director of social services. 
"Many of the kids who come to us at birth via Orangewood (Children's Home) are 
the byproducts of inadequate prenatal care." 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, we thought the biggest problem would be babies born 
AIDS-positive. But now we are overwhelmed with drug babies, babies that are 
born addicted. We get seven or eight of them every week. 
</P>
<P>
"When we planned and built the Orangewood shelter (in 1985), this (drug) 
problem didn't really exist," Leaman says. "But now our ability to care for 
infants is stretched." 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood was intended to house as many as 12 infants at one time, with the 
overflow, if any, being sent to foster homes. But drug babies need closer 
medical supervision than foster parents can provide, so they must stay either 
at the hospital or in Orangewood, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had as many as six or seven babies in the hospital ready for discharge 
with no place to put them. That's expensive. And frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Other expectant mothers may try to find treatment, but without success. Many 
pregnant women -- no one can say exactly how many -- are turned away, either by 
private physicians or the county's own clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Ehling says that even when the county does have to turn a patient away, the 
public health nurses try to offer the woman some help by doing blood and urine 
screenings and "teaching her things to look for during pregnancy that are signs 
of a complication. We don't want to give the impression that that's any 
substitute for complete medical care, but it's better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Ehling advises pregnant women, or women who think they might be pregnant, to 
seek treatment with a private physician first, someone close to their home. The 
state provides reimbursement to those doctors in many cases, through Medi-Cal 
or other programs, although many doctors are reluctant to participate. A new 
program even provides reimbursement for doctors who provide prenatal care to 
illegal immigrants, he says. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't work, he suggests trying another local doctor or clinic. Only 
as a last resort, he says, should a woman come to the county's clinic because 
it is already so far over capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't guarantee her care in any particular sector," Ehling says. "There may 
be no place for her to turn."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: WRITER TAKES NON-NOVEL APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a graduate student in UC Irvine's Program in Writing, Jay Gummerman was 
encouraged by some to write a novel rather than short stories. Publishers, 
conventional wisdom has it, are not particularly interested in story 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
And it's especially difficult to sell a collection of stories that have never 
appeared in print elsewhere, either in popular magazines or literary 
quarterlies. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente short story writer has proved conventional wisdom wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman's collection of 10 such stories, "We Find Ourselves in Moontown," has 
just been published by Knopf ($16.95). A reviewer for the New York Times, 
praising Gummerman's "ear for the absurdities of contemporary speech, combined 
with his eye for the eccentric detail," calls the book "by turns funny and 
disturbing, weird and recognizable. . . . 'We Find Ourselves in Moontown' marks 
the debut of an immensely gifted writer." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take that," Gummerman, 31, said with a laugh this week, still basking in 
the glow of his first book review. "I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman will do a reading and sign copies of his book beginning at 2 p.m. 
today at Fahrenheit 451 book store in Laguna Beach, 509 S. Coast Highway. He 
will also do a reading at UCI Irvine at 1 p.m. Wednesdayin the Babb Writing 
Center, Humanities Building, Room 126. 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman's offbeat stories are set in the new American Far West -- from Reno 
to Oregon to Southern California. It's a world populated with an odd assortment 
of characters that includes an aging, one-armed Little League umpire, a 
grade-school teacher who is involved with the pregnant mother of one of his 
students and the narrator of the title story, who is "perilously adrift in the 
Reno night." 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman, who earned his MFA degree in fiction from UCI in 1988, wrote all but 
two of the stories during the 3 years it took him to complete the 2-year 
writing program and finish his thesis. (Students are given a choice of either 
writing a novel or doing a collection of stories.) 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman credits his friend and former UCI writing workshop member, novelist 
Michael Chabon ("The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"), with helping him gain a 
literary toehold in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He really liked my work," Gummerman said, "so he recommended me to his editor 
and his editor recommended me to an agent. So then it went from there." 
</P>
<P>
Last Spring literary agent Joy Harris of the Lantz Office in New York City 
agreed to represent Gummerman. He has since recommended two other writers from 
his former UCI writing workshop to Harris -- Michelle Latiolais and Louis B. 
Jones, whose first novels will be published next year. 
</P>
<P>
While such recommendations help a writer to at least "not be part of a slush 
pile," Gummerman concedes that they offer no more than a foot in the door. In 
fact, he said, he's averaging about "50-50" with other writers he has 
recommended to his agent. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier-born Gummerman began writing plays and short stories during his 
undergraduate days at Cal State Humboldt, from which he graduated in 1980 as a 
business administration major with an emphasis in computers. 
</P>
<P>
He worked full-time as a computer programmer for 5 years -- "I was writing at 
night and I was very tired all the time" -- before entering the UCI Program in 
Writing in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Oakley Hall, director of the graduate and undergraduate writing 
programs at UCI, "was very encouraging," Gummerman said, despite the odds 
against having a collection of short stories published. "He told me I should 
just keep doing stories." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Hall said: "He's not only a good short story writer, 
he knows more about short stories than anybody I know. He's read everything." 
Hall describes Gummerman's writing style as "very distinctive, kind of 
whimsical but with sort of a dark side to it." 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the stories in Gummerman's book has appeared in print before, 
it's not for a lack of trying. Over the years, he sent his stories to "all 
kinds of magazines" -- from the New Yorker and Esquire to the Paris Review and 
a host of small literary quarterlies. But, as he put it: "No cigar." 
</P>
<P>
His only previously published short story appeared in the Chicago Review in 
1983 and does not appear in "We Find Ourselves in Moontown." 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman said the stories in his collection are not drawn directly from 
personal experience. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the stories are, strictly speaking, autobiographical but it seems like 
a lot of elements are certainly things I've witnessed," he said. "I tend to 
write the things that draw my attention to them, but I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman said he didn't have a title for his book when he sent it to his 
agent, but he wound up using the title of one of his stories. In the title 
story, a vacationing Oakland security guard named Keepnews meets a sailor at 
the Reno Airport and they end up driving into the night, into a barren and 
anonymous desert landscape that resembles the surface of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The moon metaphor seemed to fit the other stories in the collection. "All the 
characters seem to be in sort of what I'd call a Moontown: a place where the 
excess stimuli they've been experiencing has been stripped away and it's just 
this landscape," Gummerman said. 
</P>
<P>
While many authors refuse to discuss the size of their advances, Gummerman has 
no such qualms. He received a $10,000 advance for "Moontown." With a laugh, he 
said: "That seemed good to me. From not expecting any of it, I'll take what I 
get." He also has sold the paperback rights to Vintage and foreign rights have 
been sold to England, Germany and Italy. "I think," he said, "I'm up to a 
little under $50,000" for the book. 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman currently teaches composition labs at UCI and devotes full time to 
writing. His wife, Kelly, is an assistant city planner for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The author, who is currently working on a new short story, has no intention of 
turning to novels. 
</P>
<P>
"I think short stories leave more to the reader's imagination. They also tend 
to have subtler effects. You get the feeling of something in one sitting. 
There's a different kind of satisfaction with a novel. I tend to think the 
short stories are more elliptical and suggestive and I like the open-ended 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Gummerman, who admires the short stories of Raymond Carver, Richard Ford and 
John Cheever, is unable to describe his own writing style, which has been 
praised variously in book jacket blurbs for its "precise detail," "sure-footed 
whimsy" and "humor." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's humor masking sadness," he said. "I don't know. . . . If the 
writing's any good, (it) speaks for itself. You can't really give a fortune 
cookie description of it without sounding hokey."
