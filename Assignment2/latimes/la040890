HARRY TAKES A TRIP WHERE NEW YORKERS FEAR TO TREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORKERS are like 19th-Century Englishmen. Wherever they go, whatever 
benighted part of the world they choose to favor with their presence, they seek 
to re-create as much as possible of the island they left behind. 
</P>
<P>
So, during the past decade, while this area has enjoyed its most intense period 
of colonization from the East, we have reaped the cultural benefits of being 
Gothamites' home away from home: delis that have been painstakingly modeled on 
their Manhattan namesakes; out-of-the-way cafes that have suddenly learned how 
to brew -- and pronounce -- espresso, and grizzled, angry street people who are 
just a couple of years away from giving our doorways the distinctive urban 
perfume of stale human pee. 
</P>
<P>
But while New Yorkers know how to bring, these most sophisticated of our recent 
visitors don't know how to take. They tend to come out here, congregate in West 
Hollywood (because it has what they recognize as street life) or near Ventura 
Boulevard (because it doesn't) and issue their verdicts on this very small 
sample of a very large elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Not that this place's charms are all that evident to a newcomer. To be fair, 
I've always been baffled by the tendency of large numbers of people even to 
make this a vacation destination. Aside from Disneyland and the studios, and 
the beaches during those few weeks when they're not being soiled, this area's 
most attractive qualities have always seemed to reward only the patient 
attention of a longtime admirer. This is a Siamese cat of a city. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, certain sections of this newspaper squirrel away little tips on 
interesting places to go. A recent arrival not yet trained to root out such 
truffles of travel might never venture out to the desert -- not the Palm 
Springs desert of white belts and golf and Sonny Bono but the real desert, the 
place that can frighten you with its seeming emptiness. Some of us go out there 
to ride dirt bikes over it all. I go to see Southern California's answer to 
fall foliage, the sunlit fireworks of wildflower season. 
</P>
<P>
These days, there are wildflower hot lines to guarantee that a 90-minute haul 
out to the Antelope Valley will reward you with more than a view of the newest 
Builder's Emporium. But my second trip to wildflower country occurred some 
years ago, and it was the kind of adventure New Yorkers can get only by jogging 
in Central Park after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
My T. W. (Then Wife) and I drove to the Antelope Valley, procured a Lancaster 
Chamber of Commerce map and headed into the hills. (The wildflowers don't all 
bloom at once, so you have to seek out the hillsides where your eyes can be 
overwhelmed.) On the way, we each "dropped" what we thought was mescaline. I 
had taken it only a couple of times, officer, on those rare occasions when I 
ventured out to a Wonder of Nature. I found it to be, as advertised, an 
extremely mild, almost unnoticeably psychedelic substance. Its chief effect was 
to point me toward the beauty and keep me from thinking: Hope we get back in 
time for the Laker game. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not way ahead of me, you should be. These days, people don't tell 
stories about mescaline that end with "and we both had a groovy time." Pills 
can be unknowable little guys, and we had arrived overprepared too late in the 
season for flowers. Or too early. A restroom break revealed either that the 
walls of the little structure in the wilderness were crawling with thousands of 
identical insects or that I was staring at the immobile stucco through the 
window of something dramatically psychedelic. 
</P>
<P>
Now the T. W. and I were out in the middle of nowhere, with nothing beautiful 
to look at and with our minds set on bake. We consulted the map for the 
quickest route out of wherever it was we were. Like any reasonable chamber of 
commerce, the Lancaster folks had depicted their beloved city as the largest 
settlement in the neighborhood and had surrounded it with a big, red heart. 
This was mighty persuasive to people in our lack of frame of mind, which is why 
it took us about 20 minutes to realize that, sadly, the route home lay through 
Palmdale instead. 
</P>
<P>
Then as now, I had a Sunday radio program, which I had taped in advance to free 
this day for adventure. So, as our car ascended the last hill out of Desert 
Hell, I was treated to a cliche of the age coming true. I heard my voice on the 
radio, and it sounded exactly the way voices in bad versions of acid trips 
always sound -- as if it were coming from the bottom of the bathtub drain. 
Thawawawawawanks for lisssssssssening. 
</P>
<P>
We got safely home, and, as I lay on the living-room floor gazing at the 
light-green walls of my rented house, I had an intense realization: This is 
like being in the bottom of an aquarium, and I should repaint this joint 
pronto. 
</P>
<P>
It was, and I did. I have been to wildflower country many times since that 
harrowing Sunday. No mystery pills, no insects, no voice from the drain. For 
adventure, I now do what the ex-New Yorkers among us do. I go sit in a deli and 
order the corned beef.

A TOUGH OLD ROSE ; 
</P>
<P>
THIS EVERGREEN CLIMBER WITHOUT THORNS BLOOMS SOFT YELLOW IN SPRING

THE LADY BANKS' rose is not like any other. It's an evergreen, for one thing, a 
true climber, and -- to the delight of those who must prune it -- there are no 
thorns. The most beautifully situated Lady Banks' rose in our area must be the 
one at the Old Mill in San Marino. Probably planted in 1929, it grows against a 
massive adobe-block structure -- built in 1816 as a mill for the San Gabriel 
Mission -- that now serves as Southern California headquarters for the 
California Historical Society. (When a new mill was built closer to the mission 
in 1820, this one was renamed the Old Mill -- El Molino Viejo.) 
</P>
<P>
The species Rosa banksiae was discovered in Canton, China, in 1796. The 
double-yellow variety 'Lutea,' by far the most popular in Southern California 
gardens, has been cultivated since 1824. It was firmly established here by the 
end of the 19th Century. The more difficult-to-find white variety, 'Alba 
Plena,' is just as vigorous. 'Alba Plena' smells exactly like violets; 'Lutea' 
has no detectable fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
Because the wild species is from the nearly tropical portions of China, Lady 
Banks' roses are considered quite tender in most climates. In the Southwest, 
however, they are as tough as nails. 
</P>
<P>
On a 125-foot-long picket fence that encloses the front yard of her Larchmont 
Village home, Enid Kent Sperber grows six of the double yellows with one of the 
whites, which in spring smother the fence in blooms. (The plants do get a 
little mildew in the foggy spring weather but quickly outgrow it.) The gardener 
prunes the roses much like a hedge, shearing off anything that gets out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lady Banks' should not be pruned to the bone like other roses. Finch Tree 
Surgery of San Gabriel prunes the Lady Banks' for the California Historical 
Society. Once a year, the company removes a third of the growth, and every few 
years it takes off even more to keep the vine contained. Clair Martin III, rose 
curator at the Huntington Botanical Gardens, suggests not pruning much the 
first few years after planting, or the plants will produce fewer blooms. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers bloom earlier in the year than on most roses, usually in March; at the 
Old Mill they last for six weeks to two months, according to director Margaret 
Eley. Ultimately, the petals drop cleanly from the plant, and the vine appears 
as a rich green mass for the rest of the year, not reblooming as more modern 
roses do. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Banks' rose is considered one of the best plants for arbors or 
overhead trellises. It is also a stunning hillside shrub, where it can cover 20 
feet of ground with greenery, becoming a soft yellow haystack in spring. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Lady Banks' at the Old Mill is an impressively large vine, the 
largest one (and reputedly the world's largest rosebush, period) is in 
Tombstone, Ariz. Planted in 1885 from a cutting brought from Scotland, it has a 
trunk like a tree and is trained on a shaky trellis shading some 7,000 square 
feet of parched ground from the hot Sonoran sun. Little else grows in 
Tombstone, even in the fertile soil of Boot Hill, which testifies to the 
toughness of this old rose.

FRESH TOMATO SAUCE COATS A LUSCIOUS TIMBALE OF EGGPLANT, PEPPERS AND CHEESES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
T'S A WONDER that my fondness for eggplant survived my early days as a 
vegetarian. Eggplant was a staple for those too timid to test the parameters of 
meatless cuisine, and preparation involved sauteing in oil, dousing with tomato 
sauce and pelting with cheese, rendering a gooey mass of mush. 
</P>
<P>
But my enchantment with eggplant was fixed, dating from a memory of a sunny day 
in childhood. I was a city-raised 6-year-old and knew as well as the next kid 
on my block that vegetables came from the Shop Rite. But then I witnessed a 
miracle. On a visit with my grandparents, I followed my grandfather -- a 
square-built Old World Armenian -- into the garden behind his home and watched 
him tug at something close to the ground. When he straightened, he brandished 
one perfect glossy crescent, purple-black with a cap of green. He may as well 
have pulled a rabbit from a hat. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Middle Eastern cooks, my grandfather knew enough ways to cook 
eggplant to exhaust a harvest many times the size of his own. Throughout the 
years, he served it to me stuffed with ground lamb and pine nuts, brushed with 
olive oil and broiled, pureed with ground sesame seeds and spooned into pita 
pockets. I don't remember which method he used that first day; I simply recall 
that feasting on the glorious garden-grown fruit gave me a sense of the world 
as a place of hidden pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite approach to eggplant dishes is to keep the ingredients "all in the 
family" that includes tomatoes and peppers. These siblings have a striking 
affinity for one another, complementary in color, texture and taste, nowhere 
more evident than in luscious mousselike terrines. 
</P>
<P>
EGGPLANT TIMBALES IN TOMATO CREAM 
</P>
<P>
2 medium eggplant (about 2 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 garlic cloves, crushed or minced 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 large egg, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 large red bell pepper, roasted, seeded, peeled, and chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup ricotta cheese (low fat, if desired) 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup finely grated mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fine yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
Tomato Cream 
</P>
<P>
To steam eggplant, put it in metal colander or large steaming rack and place 
inside kettle or dutch oven. Add a few inches of water, cover, and steam until 
eggplant is easily pierced through with fork, about 30 minutes. Remove eggplant 
from steamer and let cool. 
</P>
<P>
Line a bowl with paper towels. When cool enough to handle, cut eggplant in half 
lengthwise and scoop pulp into towel-lined bowl. Let pulp drain 15-20 minutes. 
Pat dry and transfer to cutting board. Chop coarsely and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in wide skillet. Add shallots and garlic, and saute over low 
heat until shallots become translucent. Add oregano, salt, and eggplant and 
continue to saute, stirring occasionally to keep from sticking. Transfer to 
workbowl of food processor or blender. Add egg, red bell pepper, ricotta, 
mozzarella and cornmeal. Process until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease 4 6-ounce oven-proof ramekins or 
custard cups. Distribute eggplant mixture evenly among them. Place ramekins 
inside deep baking dish and pour in hot water halfway up ramekins' sides. Cover 
tightly with foil and place in oven. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 400 degrees two hours, checking often to maintain water level. Timbales 
(rhymes with thimbles) are done when a knife inserted in center tests clean. 
Remove from heat and let cool on rack. Loosen each timbale by running a knife 
around edge. Turn out onto individual serving plates by placing serving plate 
over ramekin, then, holding both tightly together, flipping over so ramekin is 
inverted onto plate. Serve drizzled with tomato cream. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Tomato Cream 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
1 large garlic clove, cut lengthwise into four thin slices 
</P>
<P>
4 fresh Italian plum tomatoes, peeled and chopped (about 1 cup) 
</P>
<P>
1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
Pinch of sugar 
</P>
<P>
Pinch of salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
</P>
<P>
In wide skillet, melt butter over low heat. Saute garlic in butter until slices 
start to brown. Discard garlic. Raise heat to medium flame and add tomatoes. 
Add bay leaf, and saute until tomatoes break down, about 3 minutes. Add sugar 
and salt, lower heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes more. Discard 
bay leaf. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer tomatoes to workbowl of food processor or blender. Add cream and 
process until smooth. Return to skillet and reheat gently just before serving; 
do not let mixture boil. Yield: approximately 2/3 cup.

OUTTAKES: START THE PRESSES! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stacy Jenel Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presses were rolling again at the Herald-Examiner in recent days, but it 
was just background for director Bobby Roth, who's shooting a bloody and 
climactic sequence for "Rainbow Drive," an action-suspense yarn for 
ITC/Showtime. The film -- inspired by the drug murders that involved the late 
porn star John Holmes -- wraps this weekend, as star Peter Weller, playing a 
stubborn detective, tracks down the chief villains to the bowels of the 
venerable newspaper building that closed with the demise of the Her-Ex last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The climactic sequence, Roth says, began dramatically on the rooftop, ending 
with "a pretty exciting death scene in which one of the main characters is 
thrown into the (rolling) presses." 
</P>
<P>
The movie, based on a novel by Roderick Thorpe, was originally to conclude in a 
subway, with the Her-Ex used for squad-room scenes. But Roth says "the scope of 
the presses was so impressive" that the script was rewritten to accommodate 
them. A newspaper publisher now figures heavily in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
The second floor Her-Ex editorial rooms remain a bit eery, says producer John 
Veitch. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like everyone left all of a sudden, as if all activity suddenly 
halted, with letters, books and what-have-you still scattered around."

<TEXT>
<P>
The long-shelved "Brenda Starr," based on the plucky reporter/comic book 
character, briefly came off the shelf Friday -- for a "world premiere" showing 
in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The screening marked the Florida Film Festival's salute to filmmaker Robert 
Ellis Miller ("The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter," "Reuben, Reuben"), who requested 
that "Brenda Starr" be screened. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to finally get her out of jail," Miller tells us. "It's always 
misunderstood when a picture doesn't come out. 'Brenda' deserves her day." 
</P>
<P>
Starring Brooke Shields as Starr and a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton as her 
mysterious rescuer, Basil St. John, the $16-million "Brenda Starr" was filmed 
in late 1986, with an early 1988 release planned. Then it got ensnared in legal 
entanglements involving video rights. Things were further complicated when New 
World, which had distribution rights, was sold and phased out its domestic 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Now, reports Miller, the British consortium that financed the film is acquiring 
it from New World "and there are currently negotiations for a major release -- 
at last." Pat H. Broeske

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 ROBERT PLANT "MANIC NIRVANA" ES PARANZA/ATLANTIC. ALBUMS 
ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).

Nope, this isn't it. 
</P>
<P>
Former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant still hasn't come up with that macho, 
hard-rock album Zep fans have been waiting for since the band called it quits a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
His solo albums -- this is his fifth since 1982 -- are like public dress 
rehearsals for the real thing. His last one, 1988's "Now and Zen," was a 
disjointed, dissonant mess, wandering all over the place. The new one is more 
focused -- with guitars a stronger force than usual -- but some of the pieces 
still seem cluttered and aimless, tottering on quirky rhythmic structures. 
</P>
<P>
Plant is apparently still experimenting, seeking a new niche. Meanwhile, he 
keeps Zep fans salivating with numbers, like "Nirvana," that have tantalizing 
echoes of good old Zep. The album's best song is a remake of Kenny Dino's 1961 
hit, "Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night," mainly because it's 
fairly close in spirit and feel to old Zep tunes. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for Plant to stop pussyfooting around, come to terms with whatever he

that's obviously lurking inside, clamoring to get out.

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 THE RAVE-UPS "CHANCE" EPIC. ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF

Another fairly fine effort, this "Chance" is, from L.A.'s last remaining 
ex-cowpuncher-poet rock 'n' roll band. 
</P>
<P>
But as far as truth in advertising goes, it's a bit of a tease, with not enough 
rave-ups delivered, not quite enough chances taken. The sound this time is less 
rootsy and more pop, less Dylanesque and more Zombiesque -- though not so much 
so that frontman Jimmer Podrasky doesn't still write rambling songs about what 
"the queen said to the dealer" and that sort of thing. The Rave-Ups seem to be 
groping for growth yet tentative in striking out too far, making for an 
enjoyable, reiterative follow-up that doesn't leave much to the title concept.

Barry White, the mid-'70s soul star, isn't having any hits these days, but 
young English white-soul singer Lisa Stansfield launched her solo career with 
the smash-hit single "All Around the World," which cleverly modernizes his old 
R&amp;B style. Obviously influenced by the R&amp;B greats, she sounds just like 
a black singer, singing with gospel-style fervor and heartfelt emotion. 
</P>
<P>
She delves into R&amp;B history for most of her material, which she co-wrote. 
Songs like "Mighty Love" and "This Is the Right Time" reflect the soulfulness 
of the old Philly sound. There are no bad songs on this album and some, like 
"Mighty Love" and "When Are You Coming Back?," are exceptional -- particularly 
the arrangements. There's nothing new here, just a glorious re-creation of that 
'70s soul sound. But in today's music world that's plenty. DENNIS HUNT

If it were 1979, these guys would be wearing skinny ties and doing polite 
power-pop at Madame Wong's. If it were 1984, they'd probably have eye shadow 
and some really catchy Tears for Fears-style synthesizer licks. 
</P>
<P>
But it's 1990, they're local boys, and the vein in which Love/Hate works is the 
currently fashionable L.A. "street" sound: the leather, Angst and loud pop 
hooks you might associate with, say, two out of three hard-rock bands with a 
video on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing new at this point about a Motley Crue/Guns N' Roses mix, 
"rebellious" hard rock by the numbers, sassy innuendo for Sassy teens. The real 
</P>
<P>
surprise is that Love/Hate pulls it off so well: Though it lacks the finesse of 
Junkyard and the snarl of L.A. Guns, "Blackout in the Red Room" might crank 
harder than any L.A. record of its type since "Appetite for Destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Why? Love/Hate has riffs: big, lumbering three-chord monsters of the sort that 
have been deafening teen-agers for decades, the kind that little Bobby tries to 
imitate on his first, $25 guitar. And the lyrics, when they're not cryptic, are 
Ramones-style dumb, massed choruses -- "Why do you think they call it 
dope?/Whoa-o-o, whoa-o-o" -- as funny as they are catchy. JONATHAN GOLD

In "When We Were Very Young," by Charles Perry (Feb. 4), one sentence ("The 
city lumbered into action and maintained some Quonset huts left over from the 
war as cheap public housing") does not even begin to tell about the amount of 
housing furnished to war workers, returning veterans and low-income families by 
the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles. This agency was born in 1938, 
shortly after President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a statement concerning the 
one-third of a nation that he saw as "ill-housed, ill-clad and ill-nourished." 
</P>
<P>
Housing Authority files have many photographs taken during the late 1930s and 
early 1940s, documenting the construction of temporary housing, including 
trailer homes and Quonset huts. Hundreds of units of permanent housing also 
were constructed, for those working at the shipyards, the plane factories and 
other defense industries in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The Quonset-hut development was called Rodger Young Village in honor of a young 
veteran of World War II. Later, an auditorium was built in Los Angeles, also in 
his honor. Many of the GIs who were stationed in California, or who passed 
through on their way to the South Pacific or Japan, liked what they saw here 
and returned after war's end.

I enjoyed Ellen Hawkes' article on Sue Grafton ("G Is for Grafton," Feb. 18).

I thought Grafton's (Millhone's) comment about devout Christians was a gross 
generalization. Of course, anyone can make generalizations. Here's one I like: 
Being with Sue Grafton is like being with a silly, willful child.

As the attorney for Sergio Hochman, I wish to clarify Hochman's involvement 
with La Mina. Evan Maxwell's article accurately identifies the cartel's 
money-laundering scheme; however, it is incorrect about my client's role. 
</P>
<P>
The La Mina accounts were the creation of Jorge Masihy, who, with Raul Vivas, 
Tomas Iglesias and Celio Merkin, created Cambio Italia. Not Hochman. 
</P>
<P>
The government values Hochman's cooperation and testimony because of his 
intimate knowledge of the laundering operations and his acquaintance with 
persons controlling the activities. 
</P>
<P>
Hochman has already paid dearly for his involvement in the money-laundering 
activity, as his family had to flee from Uruguay, and he can never return to 
his home country because of Raul Vivas' power and influence.

With respect to the best-actor Oscar, one can only surmise that Daniel 
Day-Lewis won over Morgan Freeman because the academy was impressed with his 
portrayal of a physically handicapped character. (So was I.) However, I wonder 
if any academy member could even fathom the difficulty inherent in Freeman's 
extraordinarily believable portrayal of a character whose imposed disadvantages 
were more visceral than visual.

The clips from the Akira Kurosawa movies showed a bunch of people being shot 
with arrows and some nice young women being cruelly killed off. 
</P>
<P>
For me as a viewer, and I'm sure for other viewers, these scenes were painful 
and just plain pointless. 
</P>
<P>
The whole attitude involved -- that by showing man's inhumanity to man you make 
us all better -- is really boneheaded. All it does is give people nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
Let's quit acting like Kurosawa is teaching people something they don't already 
know. Grossing people out to make a humanitarian point is like punching someone 
in the stomach to try to explain that being hit is painful.

Re Russell Dvonch's March 18 letter: Dvonch's hymn to capitalism would have 
been touching if it hadn't been so stupid. So "wealth . . . is not taken, by 
anybody from anybody. 
</P>
<P>
It is created. . . ." Perhaps he should explain that to the victims of the 
Lincoln S&amp;L scandal who lost their life savings while Charles H. Keating 
Jr. paid himself and family members $34 million. And the people who lost their 
jobs when their companies were taken over by leveraged-buyout raiders. Or the 
shareholders of those companies whose dividends now go toward servicing massive 
debts. Or, for that matter, to the middle class being taxed to death so that 
the rich can pay less. 
</P>
<P>
Get real, Mr. Dvonch! For a start, read the daily Times instead of just the 
Sunday Calendar. It'll show you a whole new world.

Regarding the April 1 Pop Eye report on filming security guards at rock

While attending a 1988 Midnight Oil concert at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, I 
witnessed aggressive bouncers repeatedly rough up, hit and generally abuse fans 
whose chief crime, jumping onstage, should demand at most a polite ejection 
from the venue -- not a broken nose or arm.

I sincerely hope that we do not have to relive the lesson of Altamont over and

Mark Leviton, whose March 25 letter responds to Dvonch, questions whether 
Calendar is the best forum for debating the merits of capitalism, then he 
proceeds to use it for promulgating a theory now being rejected all over the 
globe -- Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
His notion of "surplus value" is based on Marx's discredited theory that the 
value of finished goods lies only in what labor adds to the value of the raw 
materials and that the capitalist's profit represents "exploitation" of labor. 
</P>
<P>
What this theory ignores is the one thing that makes capitalism work -- the 
brilliance of the entrepreneur's mind in choosing how and where to invest. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't the benefits to society that justifies greed. Greed is simply the 
material expression of a man's right to prosper from that faculty that is most 
distinctly human: the brilliance of his mind.

True capitalism demands that all human interaction be conducted on a voluntary

depending on the subjugation of men. It is a moral system. Let's stop feeling

RANDY LEWIS: NEW-FOUND COMMERCIAL SUCCESS PLAGUES THE GRATEFUL DEAD, LONGTIME 
FOLLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Lewis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an adage, espoused on refrigerator doors across America, that states: 
"You can never be too rich or too thin." But is it possible to become too 
successful? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Probably not if you happen to be the owner of the Oakland-Los 
Angeles-Oakland Raiders. But for rock musicians, especially, sometimes a good 
thing can become too much. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the poor old Grateful Dead, who after 25 years just keep on truckin' . 
The group has suddenly found itself performer-non-grata at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre, where it had played annually since 1983, because of problems 
caused at least partially by a huge turnout for the Dead concerts last year. 
This year, the group will move its annual spring Southland shows to a soccer 
field at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? 
</P>
<P>
In the short view, the Dead can be seen as the victims of bad publicity, held 
responsible for the actions of people over whom they had no control, nor 
rightly could be expected to. For one thing, the band took the heat from locals 
and city officials about overflowing streets and freeways, complaints that 
should have been shared at least equally by the nearby El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, which brought thousands of onlookers into the area with an air show 
that same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the specifics of the Irvine Meadows incident, the Dead are feeling 
the symptoms of a condition that few people ever expected this oddball group to 
contract: an overdose of commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
The band, which has long epitomized the if-it-feels-good-do-it '60s hippie 
ethic, ambled along for years, a sizable but manageable pack of loyal Deadheads 
in tow for every show. The group would play its marathon four-hour-plus 
concerts, which were less musical events than tie-dyed carnivals with a rock 
soundtrack. At multiple-day engagements, fans would set up camp in parking 
lots, living in tents, vans and motor homes, while all manner of 
free-enterprise advocates would sell all manner of merchandise out of 
backpacks, suitcases and station wagons. 
</P>
<P>
Dead shows, while always full of eccentric characters -- many of whom probably 
could have sat through gallbladder surgery with a smile -- were comparatively 
peaceful events. This was especially true as the group trundled into the 1980s, 
when the all-stops-out extremism of punk rock made for particularly drastic 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
There was an advantage in traveling the frontage road of the rock freeway: The 
Dead could sell a couple hundred thousand copies of each album and fill up 
concert halls without having to worry about dodging celebrity-hungry 
photographers from People or the National Enquirer. But then, in 1987, the Dead 
did something no one expected. They turned out a hit single. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Dead became the focal point for a whole new audience that knew 
little about the sense of brotherhood and camaraderie that typified Grateful 
Dead gatherings. These people looked at the Dead and saw only the 
quintessential rock party band, an entity whose followers seemed to emerge from 
suspended animation long enough to shout, "Can you dig it?" "groovy" and 
"ohhhhhh, mannnnnnn!" for a few hours at a concert before stepping back into 
mothballs -- headbands, cotton drawstring trousers and all. 
</P>
<P>
Dead shows soon began to draw more and more fans interested in nothing more 
than partying their brains out, oxymoronic as that may be. That contingent 
isn't by any means new to the group's following, but the dimension to which it 
has grown is. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends who were complaining about the 'new' Deadheads in 1972 -- 
really," said the group's longtime publicist, Dennis McNally. "But without 
being invidious to any one group of people, in general (problems have resulted 
from) sheer numbers. You put lots of people in a small space, and some people 
start stepping on some people's toes. . . . We've had to put an end to the 
camping and vending to calm down what goes on outside our show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kinda sad," McNally said, "and it's massively challenging. Most of what 
we have to deal with these days is the fallout of getting bigger. The story 
every year is that it all gets a little bigger, a little more complicated." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the people who lose the most are the longtime fans. And the loss is 
that much greater with acts like the Dead, who have fostered an intensely loyal 
following that treats the group members not as gods to be worshipped but as 
friends to be cherished. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Springsteen and Peter Gabriel are other examples of artists forced to 
change the very essence of their acts as they've captured more of the pop 
mainstream with their music. Springsteen had to abandon his penchant for 
jumping into the crowd; his audience became filled with people who'd rather 
take home a piece of his blue jeans than shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel, too, has favored human contact with his audience: At the end of his 
shows, he used to stand at the edge of the stage, back to the audience, and 
fall backward into the arms of his fans. They would pass him, hand over hand, 
to the back of the hall, at which point he would jump down and run back to the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
This intensely emotional, almost spiritual ritual was enacted countless times 
before his 1983 Top 30 hit "Shock the Monkey" and continued even after he 
racked up a No. 1 single in 1986 with "Sledgehammer." But the last time I saw 
Gabriel attempt this, the change was sobering. What once had been an exercise 
in trust had been reduced to a mad grab for a piece of a star, as fans 
literally tore the shirt from his back and stripped the shoes and socks from 
his feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Grateful Dead, Springsteen and Gabriel probably won't let these changes 
stop them from touring. But as McNally said, "It's kinda sad." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the secret for rock stars who want to prevent their followings from 
getting out of hand can be found in the words of Neil Young, who has found his 
share of mainstream success but has changed directions too quickly to have a 
serious head-on collision with fame. 
</P>
<P>
After his 1972 No. 1 hit, "Heart of Gold," gave him a taste of life in the big 
time, he commented: "This song put me in the middle of the road. Traveling 
there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw 
more interesting people there."

After meticulously cleaning a plastic tray of its spaghetti, bread and salad on 
a recent sunny afternoon, Troy Tutt sat back on a bench outside the House of 
Yahweh, a Lawndale soup kitchen, and summed up one of the problems facing the 
hungry and homeless around the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't remember -- I don't have a house, so I don't have a 
refrigerator, or a stove, or even silverware and a can opener," said Tutt, a 
homeless man wearing a cast on his arm. Tutt said he lost his job and home 
after he was hit by a car and was unable to work. "That's why I come here." 
</P>
<P>
Tutt's observation echoes what homeless advocates say about the problems 
homeless people face when it comes to finding food: Dozens of South Bay 
churches, volunteers and government agencies dole out tons of flour, canned 
goods and other foodstuffs to poor people with places to prepare the food, but 
only a handful of agencies serve prepared food. 
</P>
<P>
For many homeless people, receiving a bag of groceries can be as frustrating as 
it is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to another place I heard about in Torrance where they gave out 
groceries. But that was hard, because I had nowhere to fix the food," said a 
man at the House of Yahweh who asked to be identified only as Howard. "If I 
don't get it here, I can sometimes go to stores where they are throwing out 
(bread). If not, I just go hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Though many South Bay organizations began feeding poor and homeless people in 
the early 1980s, some have closed their doors in recent years because of crime 
problems or because the numbers of volunteers began to drop. Others have 
refocused on more time-consuming counseling and referral services, forcing them 
to reduce the numbers of people they feed. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Yahweh, which serves about 150 people every day, is one of only 
three agencies in the South Bay that regularly serves hot meals. The Crossing 
in San Pedro feeds about 150 people four times a week. And the Beacon Light 
Mission in Wilmington feeds up to 80 people nightly. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates estimate there are hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of 
homeless in the South Bay, but operators of soup kitchens do not know how many 
of their clients fall into that category. Although firm numbers are elusive, 
social workers say the need for food is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people come in here on Thursday and say they have not eaten since 
they were here last Saturday," said Edwin Kise of The Crossing, a group 
composed of volunteers from 16 San Pedro churches that feeds and ministers to 
the poor and homeless every Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Soup kitchens face a host of obstacles: inadequate facilities to serve 
increasing numbers of people, few volunteers willing to make a long-term 
commitment and complaints from neighbors that they attract unsavory elements to 
the neighborhood. Those pressures have forced many groups to end or curtail 
feeding programs in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's Table in Wilmington, which opened four years ago and at times fed 
more than 100 people a day, gradually scaled back operations to two days a week 
because of a string of robberies and security problems. Early in March, two 
more robberies left the program without cooking utensils, forcing it to end the 
meal service altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really disheartened. There is still a great need for this kind of 
service in Wilmington," said Carol Smetzer, who coordinated the soup kitchen's 
activities for Catholic Charities. Smetzer said the agency is evaluating 
whether to reopen the kitchen, but that it may not be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Some relief workers say they do not have enough volunteers to handle the work 
entailed in preparing food for increasing numbers of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Community interest is hard to maintain," said Carolyn Olney, program 
coordinator for Food Partnership, a Carson group that trucks donated food to 
shelters and soup kitchens. "It is very difficult to keep up private sector 
support. What was once considered an emergency food problem has now become a 
chronic problem." 
</P>
<P>
Olney said a decrease in government donations of foodstuffs such as cheese and 
butter has also placed more of the food supply burden on private citizens, who 
often cannot keep up donations over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Many groups, sensing the impossibility of feeding all the homeless in their 
areas, have begun to focus their efforts on specific populations of homeless, 
such as the mentally ill and women with children. 
</P>
<P>
Crossroads in Redondo Beach, a branch of the Didi Hirsch Mental Health Center 
in Culver City, distributes sandwiches and coffee two days a week to mentally 
ill homeless people who gather at local sites such as Alondra Park and Lennox 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fenner, program coordinator for Crossroads, said providing food gives the 
agency a way to contact such people so they can direct them to established 
medical and social service programs. Despite the focus on the mentally ill, 
Fenner said, staff workers find it hard to ignore other homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting distracted by the general homeless population in the South Bay. 
It is very hard to pull up in the van and say, 'Sorry, we can't give you 
anything because you are not mentally ill,' " Fenner said. Volunteers generally 
do not turn away someone who is obviously hungry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups have turned to a more comprehensive approach after deciding that 
their soup kitchens were doing little to strike at the roots of homelessness, 
including poor education, drug and alcohol abuse, and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
The FISH Emergency Center, once an independent organization known as 
Harbor-Peninsula FISH (Friends in Service to Humanity) and now a part of the 
Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro, is one such group that abandoned the 
feed-and-let-be approach. Volunteers used to provide groceries to homeless and 
needy people without attempting further services. The group now interviews food 
recipients to help volunteers direct them to government programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer see ourselves as primarily a distributor of food as we once did. 
It seemed ridiculous for us to give them groceries for two or three days. We 
decided it was much more sensible to sit down with the homeless and assist them 
with the process of getting more help," said David Christiansen, executive 
director of the shelter. "But that obviously slows down the process; it takes 
more time and volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Such efforts are not universally welcomed by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Anthony is a homeless man who comes to the Beacon Light Mission in 
Wilmington, a shelter that serves meals for up to 80 homeless men every night 
after a short chapel service. Anthony said it is the food, not the ministry or 
counseling, that draws many homeless people to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We all go to services here. But really, when you look around, not that many 
guys are paying attention," Anthony said outside the mission one recent night. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Yahweh in Lawndale requires only that participants be sober and 
that they wear shirts and shoes when they eat. 
</P>
<P>
"I do want the opportunity to get somewhere, but I don't think I should have to 
do something just so I can eat," said Howard at the House of Yahweh. "I used to 
work, pay taxes. Hopefully I won't be in this situation too long, but I don't 
need anybody pushing me." 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates say that people with long experience on the street are adept 
at finding food when no shelter or soup kitchen is available. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody would necessarily die if we stopped feeding," said 
Fenner of Crossroads. "They are very resourceful at finding food. They know 
when certain restaurants dump food. They know which bins at stores have 
leftover food and which don't." 
</P>
<P>
But homeless advocates say their clients sometimes turn to crime in order to 
feed themselves. Some predict that the problem will grow worse as the numbers 
of homeless increase and food resources dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to have to steal for food, beg for food, sell drugs for food, 
unless we start to do more," said Richard Kennedy, executive director of the 
Employment Readiness and Support Center in Carson, which houses and feeds 22 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to run a soup kitchen facility, but we just don't have the time 
and resources to devote to that. I'm afraid there are very few people out there 
who realize this problem exists. If all those people could help, we might get 
somewhere."

STUDY SAYS MORE SPECIES AT RISK ON LAX DUNES 
</P>

<P>
The tiny El Segundo Blue butterfly, the object of highly publicized rescue 
attempts since it was declared endangered in 1975, isn't the only threatened 
species living on the sand dunes at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of a 2 1/2-year study of the 302-acre El Segundo dunes at 
the west end of the airport's runways. The study identified eight insects and a 
flower that apparently live only on the dunes and could also be classified as 
endangered, according to Rudi Mattoni, a geneticist who conducted the study for 
the city's Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
The insects include a cricket, spider, two beetles and four moths, he said. The 
flower is the spineflower, an annual. 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge, they are nowhere else but the El Segundo dunes," Mattoni 
said. "They are all riding on the same airplane, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
The dunes have received much public attention in recent years because the area 
is a habitat for the butterfly, which is listed by the federal government as an 
endangered species. Habitats for the insect have successfully been established 
on the dunes at the airport and at the nearby Chevron oil refinery in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Mattoni said the study is probably the most exhaustive biological survey that 
has ever been done on the airport dunes. The dunes are the last large parcel of 
a dune system that once stretched from Point Conception south into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the dunes are littered with the cracked concrete streets, fire 
hydrants and other remnants of a neighborhood condemned long ago to establish a 
clear zone for overflying aircraft, 43 acres have been left largely untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Of the animal and plant species that exist on the airport dunes, the study 
identified 28 that are indigenous to the original dune system. There probably 
is a larger number of such species, but that estimate is the best available, 
given present scientific knowledge of the dune system, the study states. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, native plant and animal life on the dunes have been seriously 
affected by development and soil contamination, which in turn have allowed 
non-native species to invade the area, according to the study. Of the 20 
original mammals believed to have occupied the dunes, only three -- gophers, 
pack rats and meadow mice -- remain, Mattoni said. 
</P>
<P>
Of 91 plant species that once existed on the airport dunes, only 58 are now 
found there and 19 are in danger of being eliminated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mattoni embarked on his study in May, 1987, months after the California Coastal 
Commission refused to give the airport permission to build a golf course and a 
100-acre nature preserve on the dunes. The commission said it was unclear what 
effect the golf course would have on the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Los Angeles City Council years ago unanimously approved the 
plan for the golf course and preserve, the coastal commission recently informed 
city planners that, under state law, another public hearing must be held 
because more than four years have elapsed since it was submitted to the 
commission. Also, the City Council must vote again on the matter, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is seeking to have the entire 
project reviewed by city planners. The councilwoman favors the construction of 
a golf course on a portion of the dunes but wants the preserve area 
significantly enlarged, perhaps to 200 acres, according to her spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Laham, the airport's chief environmental officer, said the butterfly, 
as well as the other eight rare insects and the flower identified by the study, 
were all found within the acreage that the airport has earmarked for the nature 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, in his judgment, the area where the proposed golf course would 
be built is as barren as the moon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For more than four years, airport officials have worked to establish a habitat 
for the butterfly. Under Mattoni's direction, non-native plants that were 
crowding out vegetation eaten by the butterfly were removed. Since work began, 
the size of the butterfly population has increased from about 400 to at least 
2,000, according to Mattoni. 
</P>
<P>
The butterfly habitat is located within a 46-acre parcel that the airport has 
been attempting to restore. Plants not indigenous to the dunes have been 
removed and native vegetation has been planted. A nursery has been set up to 
propagate rare plants, Mattoni said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 32 red foxes have been trapped and removed from the area during 
the last 18 months. The non-native animals have wreaked havoc with the dunes 
ecosystem by eating native animals, reptiles and birds, Mattoni said. An 
unknown number of foxes remain. 
</P>
<P>
The study concludes that it could cost $35,000 an acre to restore the entire 
dune area. That would include the cost of removing 30,000 cubic yards of 
concrete and rubble and 10,000 cubic yards of non-native plants, as well as 
restocking the area with native plants. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, restoring the 100-acre preserve would cost an average of $9,000 
an acre, according to the study. A major reason for the lower cost is because 
the preserve would include the 43 acres that have been left largely 
undisturbed. Mattoni's study will be formally presented to airport officials 
April 24.

PATHS TO PARK VARY, BUT HOMELESS FIND A COMMUNITY THERE; 
</P>
<P>
ALONDRA: REGULARS WORRY, RAGE, GRIEVE, AND POOL RESOURCES OF FOOD, BOOZE AND 
COMPASSION.

<P>
The glistening lake and inviting lawns of Alondra Park lure visitors from all 
over the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Some come for a stroll, some a bicycle ride, others spend an afternoon fishing 
or feeding the ducks and geese. 
</P>
<P>
Some people, however, come to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in a stretch of unincorporated county land surrounded by Torrance, 
Lawndale, Gardena and Hawthorne, Alondra Park has become an unofficial haven 
for the South Bay's homeless population, a place where they gather to share 
what meager resources they can scrounge in their constant struggle to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"You get people who are anywhere from their 20s to their 50s," said Michele 
May, chairwoman of the South Bay Homeless Coalition. "The reasons (they are 
homeless) vary greatly. For one person, it's a divorce. For another, they were 
laid off. Basically, it's the cost of housing around here and . . . then just 
one little thing seems to set a whole wheel of things into motion that makes 
them end up here." 
</P>
<P>
May estimates that 50 people call Alondra Park home, but social workers say as 
many as 30 more people who live in corrugated cardboard huts on nearby freeway 
embankments can be counted as part of Alondra's community. 
</P>
<P>
During the hours when the park is open to the public, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., 
Alondra's regulars can be found in scattered groups throughout the park, 
sleeping on tattered blankets, sorting through soiled bags and boxes of 
belongings and, sometimes, sharing a bottle of cheap wine. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 p.m., however, the homeless of Alondra melt into the darkness to stay 
clear of the county's Safety Patrol officers, who enforce park hours, and to 
dodge police officers from the three city departments and the county Sheriff's 
Department, who want them to stay out of their jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the homeless spend their nights being bounced from one jurisdiction 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at another park, and the police hassled me and said, 'Go to Alondra 
Park,' " said Gary Ellison, 36, an out-of-work electrician. "You go across the 
street, they say, 'Go back to Alondra Park.' You go back in the park, they say, 
'Get out of the park. It's after hours.' That's how I get my exercise, going 
back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
The more fortunate residents of Alondra own the battered cars and vans that dot 
the park's long, narrow parking lot along Redondo Beach Boulevard. The cars 
must be moved every night, but in the eyes of those with nothing at all, even 
the most dilapidated car is a treasure -- a private place to store belongings, 
to stretch out for an undisturbed nap or to escape the rain and winds of 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Alondra Park's regulars are as attentive to their community as a first-class 
Neighborhood Watch group. They carefully check out newcomers, freezing out 
belligerent people who could pose a threat to the park's harmony, but creating 
a network of emotional support for those who pass muster. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Chew, 47, joined the group in February when several Alondra Park 
regulars met her at the Inglewood armory, where the homeless are allowed to 
stay during the area's coldest weather. Delighted by the fast-paced tales she 
told in her breathless New York accent, they took her back to Alondra with them 
after the armory closed in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Gnawing on a raw carrot, Chew rocks nervously from foot to foot as she explains 
how she hit the streets after her husband died in 1988, eventually wandering 
down to the South Bay from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't take life anymore. I was very down and depressed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Tears well up in her eyes and slide slowly down her face. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know if my husband was here, I'd be OK," she says. 
</P>
<P>
One of her new Alondra friends looks up as he digs through a box of groceries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here," he tells her. "You're OK." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, residents of the park have broken into two factions of 
homeless. The gregarious old-timers, eager to show newcomers the ropes, tend to 
stay in the park's southern half. Chronic alcoholics, drug addicts and the 
isolated troublemakers of the park, many incapable of coexisting peacefully 
with anyone, stick to the park's north side. 
</P>
<P>
Grocery distribution takes place in the uneasy neutral zone that Alondra's 
residents call "middle park." 
</P>
<P>
Those who live this tenuous existence often make light of it to outsiders. All 
view it as a temporary condition. To do otherwise, even briefly, is to admit 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
But even approaching Alondra Park as a short-term home can be demoralizing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get work again, and I'm going to get out of here, but, man, it 
seems like forever," Ellison said, wiping his hand across his forehead. "You're 
homeless, you're depressed, and you're going to be tempted. Yeah, I drink. . . 
. Otherwise, you're going to go insane." 
</P>
<P>
On this day, Ellison and some buddies have gathered to get groceries from a 
group of church volunteers, who each Wednesday stage a morning worship service 
before distributing the overripe fruit and vegetables, day-old bread and other 
excess food they have collected from local markets and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The grocery distribution creates a rare festive atmosphere at Alondra. Even 
homeless women and families, usually so careful to blend into the mainstream or 
hide elsewhere, come out openly for their share of the food. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia May, 30, (no relation to Michele May) used to walk her dog in Alondra 
when she lived with her boyfriend in a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
"He met somebody else, and he said, 'Goodby,' " May said, shrugging as she 
talked about the loss of her home last June. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she sleeps behind one of the park restrooms and sorts through the 
vegetables and instant noodle packets offered by the church workers each week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned the ropes. I share with everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of Alondra's regulars, May relishes good community gossip, eagerly 
whispering confidences about who's going into a detoxification clinic and who 
might be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like a 'Peyton Place' around here. Everybody knows what everybody 
else is doing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents of Alondra Park are mentally unstable and unable to care for 
themselves. Those who are stable keep an eye on their incapacitated friends. If 
they sleep too late in the morning, they wake them to check that they're all 
right. They bring them food and water when they are too lethargic to find it 
themselves or when hallucinations make them lose track of when they ate their 
last meal. 
</P>
<P>
Alondra's regulars have been especially worried these last few weeks about Ted, 
a bedraggled street person who has lived on the corner of Prairie Avenue and 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard for two years. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Ted's only delight was his dog, a black, hairy mass of an animal 
named Pal that slept peacefully by his side as Ted sat under the park's 
bleachers, carrying on conversations with himself through an imaginary 
telephone receiver in his hand. Passers-by would stop to talk to Pal and Ted, 
occasionally drawing Ted out of his dementia for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But Pal didn't have a license, or a leash. In January, animal control officers 
took her away. Ted's tenuous grip on reality has faded dramatically since then. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see people lose their self-respect," Mike Smith, 27, resident 
philosopher of Alondra, said sighing. "They lose so much of their self-respect 
out here. It's a hurt. It's a hurt to see." 
</P>
<P>
That pain is shared by a growing group of local volunteers, who have begun a 
slow process they call "outreach," a careful building of trust that they hope 
will let them match some of Alondra's regulars with social programs that could 
bring them back into the mainstream of society. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to Alondra to feed the ducks and then I found out that people 
were going there to feed people and I said, 'This has got to stop,' " said 
volunteer May, 32, a Torrance administrative assistant who became an advocate 
for the homeless less than six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition she chairs was created last year to bring attention to the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just people like you and I, and it's not right at all that they have 
to be reduced to this," May said. "There has to be something more we can do for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Social workers for Crossroads, a Redondo Beach program for mentally ill 
homeless people, began bringing sandwiches and clothing to the park a year ago 
in an effort to find out who was living there and what services they could use. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, their outreach program has been turned over to the coalition, whose 
members take turns keeping tabs on residents of Alondra and several other South 
Bay parks. The problems they have found at Alondra are typical of homelessness 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Approximately one-third are mentally ill," said Caroline Hill, a Crossroads 
employee who helped create the outreach program. "At least 80% are (occasional) 
substance abusers and of those, about 20% are what you would call the real 
chronic alcoholics or drug addicts. The rest just use it to cope with their 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of helping them survive, however, the drugs and alcohol more often 
slowly destroy all hope for Alondra's regulars. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to drink. This park will drive you out of your gourd if you don't," 
explained Mitch Nicholson, a 28-year veteran of the Marines, one blustery day 
just before Thanksgiving. "I have to get out of this park. Somehow, someway, I 
have to get out of this park." 
</P>
<P>
A bandy-legged, tough-talking, hard-drinking little man, Nicholson won a soft 
spot in the hearts of his Alondra friends through his generosity with his 
pension checks and beer. Late last year, he announced that he had heard of a 
program in Santa Monica that might help him get back into an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably end up dying in this dump," he groused, shortly before leaving 
Alondra. "You got to die someplace. Might as well be Alondra." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson disappeared shortly after. Several weeks later, he was found dead, 
apparently of natural causes, in a Santa Monica alley.

WHO ARE THE DISPLACED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a survey by Shelter Partnership, a downtown Los Angeles-based 
program, the fastest-growing segment of the county's suburban homeless -- 
nearly one-third -- are families with children. Another one-third are veterans. 
</P>
<P>
From 10% to 25% are working but cannot afford housing. About one-quarter are 
mentally ill, nearly 15% are alcoholics, and 16% are drug abusers. Some of the 
homeless are included in more than one category. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a United Way study of Los Angeles County concluded that 35,000 people 
are homeless. The study estimated that roughly 7% of those -- or 2,450 men, 
women and children -- can be found in the South Bay-Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
Even that study, however, relied on statistics supplied by shelters, food 
pantries and soup kitchens. There are comparatively few such facilities in the 
South Bay, and officials at those that do exist say there are many homeless 
people who are too frightened or too mentally ill to seek their help. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for homelessness vary, but much of it can be attributed to growing 
numbers of families dropping below the federal poverty line. In 1980, 13.4% of 
the county's population was living in poverty, defined as an annual income of 
less than $8,850 for a family of three. That percentage now has risen to about 
16%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, state and federal policies aimed at moving the mentally ill out of 
institutions -- without providing adequate outpatient services -- have helped 
increase the numbers of homeless mentally ill on the streets, social workers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
They cite a telling statistic: 40,000 mental patients were housed in California 
state hospitals in 1969. That number had dropped to 5,000 patients in 1985.

Q &amp; A 
</P>
<P>
Q: My favorite stock is Galveston-Houston. It's a turnaround situation and has 
made a big move percentage-wise this past year. I'm wondering what the pros 
think of its prospects. -- Oceanport, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: Galveston-Houston, a Houston-based manufacturer of actuators and replacement 
parts for earth moving machinery, has to be one of the quietest success stories 
of the past six months. The stock is trading at about $6 a share -- better than 
twice its price level of last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Analysts -- only two follow the company -- say a recent North Sea oil 
platform disaster prompted the British government to order the installation of 
automatic safety valves on pipelines and platforms. That has greatly expanded 
the demand for Galveston-Houston's actuators, which lie at the heart of 
equipment-control systems. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Mills of Lovett Underwood, Neuhaus &amp; Webb, a Houston-based brokerage 
firm, believes that the stock could appreciate 20% a year over the near term. 
He's predicting earnings growth to 46 cents a share in the current year, and at 
least a dime better than that in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The company earned just 24 cents a share last year. And that 20% growth in the 
stock's price, says Mills, presumes that nothing else happens to cause an 
increased demand for the company's products. The large number of petrochemical 
plants now being constructed could be the company's ace in the hole that'll 
keep Galveston-Houston's stock humming. 
</P>
<P>
Institutional Brokers Estimate System's computer over at Lynch, Jones &amp; 
Ryan shows that the two analysts following Galveston-Houston have increased 
their earnings estimate by nearly 19% in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own 1,800 shares of Canadian Marconi Co., listed on the American Stock 
Exchange. The stock has reached an all-time low. I have profits in this. What 
should I do? -- Roseto, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A: Here's what one analyst, who for obvious reasons didn't want to be 
identified, said about Canadian Marconi's stock: "It's not going anywhere. It's 
dead money." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Canadian Marconi's heavy reliance on government (especially U.S. 
government) defense spending, the company's revenue and profit picture aren't 
likely to improve much. That's the downside, so to speak, of reduced military 
tensions around the world. Canadian Marconi's biggest problem is with a radio 
that it has been selling to the U.S. Army. That radio -- the GRC 103 -- was hot 
stuff at one time. But it has cooled off and so too have Canadian Marconi's 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
According to IBES, Canadian Marconi was forecast to have earned between 80 
cents and $1.10 (Canadian) a share in the year that ended March 31. The average 
estimate was 93 cents. That doesn't compare very favorably to the $1.02 a share 
that the company earned in its previous fiscal year. Right now, analysts are 
predicting that profits will be between 95 cents and $1.30 a share for the year 
that ends in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1987, my husband purchased an annuity through E. F. Hutton. The insurance 
company issuing the annuity was First Capital Life Insurance Co. in La Jolla. 
We called Weiss Research Inc., and it rated First Capital Life as very poor. We 
were quite upset. 
</P>
<P>
Our broker, however, says the company has a good rating. We can draw out the 
money, minus a 3% penalty. Or we can draw up to 10% annually without a penalty. 
We also have money in certificates of deposits and zero-coupon bonds. My 
husband is 54 years old. Neither of us likes to gamble. What should we do? -- 
Rougon, La. 
</P>
<P>
A: Michael Smith, a top New York financial planner, says it would be fine to 
keep the annuity. While First Capital Life isn't a top-rated insurance company, 
it looks safe. But Smith, who runs Michael F. Smith Associates, thinks that you 
would do better by taking the 10% out of the annuity each year and diversifying 
your portfolio into a "broad-based common stock mutual fund." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they have everything in fixed-income investments generating a return 
that is currently OK but doesn't protect them against inflation," says Smith. 
"And they are young at 54." 
</P>
<P>
"You might even consider taking part of the CD money, once it matures, and also 
putting it into a high-quality stock fund," says Smith. At this point in your 
lives, Smith thinks that 30% to 40% of your assets should be in common stock.

ENGINEERS WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE 1990S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Martinez' "What Makes America Work" in the "Southern California Job Market" 
section and other stories about changing careers really hit home. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, I decided to change careers mostly because I wanted to do 
something that gave me a sense of pride, satisfaction and accomplishment. 
Today, as a lawyer who represents people who are fired wrongfully from their 
jobs, I know I made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
I empathize with the aerospace workers worried about losing their jobs through 
no fault of their own. It is hard to convey in words the depth of emotion from 
a client who says, "For 25 years I was the XYZ Co. in Southern California. Now 
I am nothing!" 
</P>
<P>
As mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and the like go on, we should not 
forget that those who often pay the highest price are the ones out there 
pounding the pavement.

CALIFORNIA HAD ITS OWN ZAIBATSU IN EARLY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found Michael Schrage's article ("Applying Zaibatsu Principles in the U.S.," 
March 8) fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
I had just read a history of Bechtel Co. 
</P>
<P>
("Friends in High Places" by Laton McCartney) that commented that the Bechtels 
and other companies associated with the six companies in the Boulder Dam 
project made up a California zaibatsu. They clearly fit Schrage's description 
of the "developmental conglomerate," associating more informally than formally, 
pooling resources and jointly pursuing projects of a scope that none could do 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they did this at a time when California and the West were short of 
capital and when Western companies were at a political disadvantage for 
securing federal contracts or Wall Street financing. 
</P>
<P>
I have always been dissatisfied with discussions of this group that tried to 
fit them into the traditional "robber baron" or "military/industrial complex" 
models (although in the postwar period Bechtel, at least, certainly conforms to 
the latter image). This approach, somehow, seems to miss the creative and 
critical role that they played in California's emergence as a modern industrial 
state.

WE NEED DEADLINE FOR GETTING TAX INFORMATION 
</P>

<P>
There should be a deadline for firms mailing you those envelopes containing 
income tax information, like, let's say, March 1 of each year! It's very 
inconvenient for taxpayers to have to delay their returns until all of these 
"missiles" have arrived. Maybe the penalty to the firm mailing same is needed.

I read "The West -- a Literary State of Mind"(April 1) with great pleasure and 
interest, and I applaud your effort to promote Western writers. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pity you could not acknowledge some of the pioneers in the field -- 
Jack London, William Saroyan, John Steinbeck. And surely a tip of the hat could 
have been given to the late Lawrence Clark Powell, UCLA Librarian, who promoted 
Western writing and writers all of his life. And how about recognition for the 
foresight of the University of Wyoming in establishing the American Heritage 
Center, which is collecting the papers and manuscripts of Western writers?

QUESTIONING 'FAITH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The correct term for the plight of the runaways in Livingston, Mont., is 
spiritual abuse. Unfortunately, Americans have so little language for spiritual 
realities other than that provided by institutional religions that spiritual 
abuse goes unrecognized not only in this extreme case but in millions of 
American homes. 
</P>
<P>
If it were adults who were being forced into the spiritual practices described, 
it would be grounds for revolution. But because they are young adults, they 
forfeit our collective protection. Perhaps some good can come from this if test 
cases do result, and the pain of spiritual abuse for children is exposed and 
made conscious. At the very least, the state must stop enforcing the obedience 
of children to parents who are spiritually violating them.

<P>
In "The West -- A Literary State of Mind" (View, April 1), writer Frank Waters 
is quoted as saying that the "golden myth of the West is an epic of cruel 
conquest" (with the cavalry wiping out Indians), and Westward expansion is a 
joke and blot on American history. 
</P>
<P>
When Mormon pioneers under the leadership of Brigham Young migrated west from 
Nauvoo, Ill., and first settled the Great Salt Lake valley in July, 1847, they 
befriended and fed Indian tribes and carved out new settlements throughout the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest researcher-writer Waters visit the Tucson and Huntington libraries 
and write another book on the 19th-Century Mormons who helped build up the 
American West.

VOTERS WILL GO TO POLLS IN 22 CITIES THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters will go to the polls Tuesday in 22 San Gabriel Valley cities to elect 
mayors and council members and decide several issues, including proposed tax 
increases, rent regulation for mobile homes and the potential sale of a 
community hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Elections to choose council members and, in some cases, mayors will be held in 
Arcadia, Azusa, Baldwin Park, Claremont, Covina, Diamond Bar, El Monte, 
Glendora, Irwindale, La Puente, La Verne, Monrovia, Monterey Park, Rosemead, 
San Dimas, San Gabriel, Sierra Madre, South El Monte, South Pasadena, Temple 
City and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, although no municipal offices will be at stake, the city of 
Alhambra will hold a special election to repeal an ordinance that bans the sale 
or transfer of Alhambra Community Hospital without approval of two-thirds of 
the voters. City officials and hospital board members are seeking the repeal to 
give them greater freedom to deal with the hospital's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tax measures will be on the ballot in Covina, Glendora and Sierra Madre. In a 
non-binding advisory measure, Covina residents will vote on whether their City 
Council should create a fire assessment district that would charge homeowners 
$72 a year for fire services, freeing other revenues for paramedic services, 
police patrols and street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora voters will decide whether a property tax of 20 cents per $100 
assessed value should be levied to raise money to buy hillside land for 
conservation. Passage would require a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Madre, two issues are on the ballot. One measure would increase 
property taxes by 8.5 cents per $100 assessed value to raise money to pay for 
paramedic services. The measure requires a two-thirds vote. The other proposal 
is an advisory vote on whether council members should be limited to two 
consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park voters will consider whether to revise the system of choosing a 
mayor. One proposal would convert the position from an elective office to a 
rotating post among council members. Another measure would retain the elected 
mayor's position but extend the term from two years to four. 
</P>
<P>
In El Monte, a ballot measure asks whether the mobile home rent review program 
should be replaced with a rental assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
A proposition on the ballot in Monterey Park would revise and extend 
Proposition K, which was passed by voters in 1982 to limit residential 
construction. The new measure, Proposition S, would maintain growth controls on 
residential building through the end of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to filling municipal offices, voters on Tuesday will choose two 
state senators to represent portions of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The new city manager, who will replace retiring City Manager Donald McIntyre, 
has already cost the city $53,770 -- and he hasn't been chosen yet. 
</P>
<P>
The city has spent that much so far on search firms, recruiter expenses, 
interview lunches and dinners, as well as reimbursement of travel expenses for 
city manager candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The expenditures could go as high as $80,000, Mayor William Thomson said, 
because some city directors have decided to travel to the home cities of the 
three finalists: Jack Bond, county manager in Durham County, N.C.; Philip 
Hawkey, city manager in Toledo, Ohio; and Larry Moore, city manager in 
Richmond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole visited the three cities last week. Thomson and Director 
Kathryn Nack will make separate visits next week, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
The board is making the trips "to actually see what the communities are like 
and to see what the accomplishments are of the different candidates as they 
have been described to us," Thomson said. "It's one thing to be told a person 
has accomplished something and they are proud of it. It's another thing to see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson also said the trip would enable the directors to observe how the 
candidates get along with minorities in their urban communities. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three candidates, only Bond has escaped on-the-job controversies 
involving minorities or women during his tenure in office. But his job 
performance may have benefited from the rising financial health of Durham 
County, which peaked when Bond took office in 1984, said Durham County 
Commission Chairman William Bell. The city also has a number of prestigious 
black-owned businesses, such as banks and life insurance companies. In the 
1930s, the city was dubbed the "Black Wall Street of the South," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Toledo had lost money in savings and loan investments shortly before 
Hawkey took the job there. Hawkey also inherited some lingering discontent 
engendered by past racial discrimination, Toledo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In his effort to reorganize Richmond City Hall, Moore drew opposition from 
women employees and a labor union official, Mayor George Livingston said. 
However, Livingston said, Moore ultimately received citywide support, including 
the business sector and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson downplayed the controversies and said city directors have examined the 
issues to their satisfaction and do not perceive them as serious obstacles to 
hiring any of the three final candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he could not predict exactly when the new manager will be named. 
</P>
<P>
The three finalists were chosen after a lengthy recruiting effort by two search 
firms, RJA Management Services Inc. of Arcadia and Shannon and Associates of 
Sacramento. The search firms held public hearings in Pasadena to provide an 
opportunity for residents to list the qualities they desired in the new city 
manager. Two recruiters also traveled across the country to cull six 
semi-finalists from among 75 applicants. Those six were interviewed by Pasadena 
directors March 8 at the Airport Hilton Hotel in Burbank. The three finalists 
returned in mid-March with their spouses for more interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lengthy search period, the directors could not decide on a new city 
manager and decided to make the additional trips. Although Director Chris 
Holden has publicly criticized the added expenditures as unnecessary, Thomson 
said the expense is small compared to the importance of finding someone to 
oversee a $226-million annual operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
The expenditures so far include: $44,600 for the two recruiting firms; $7,900 
for travel reimbursement of candidates, including some of the first 75 
applicants; and $1,270 for the interview room in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be filed with the city are receipts for a lunch and dinner at the 
Caltech Athenaeum with the full board, two candidates and their wives, and a 
lunch at Vista Del Arroyo at the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals with another 
candidate and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Additional travel expenses are expected to be filed by other candidates and by 
the directors who travel to the finalists' hometowns.

LEGISLATURE OKS BILL GIVING TAX MONEY TO DIAMOND BAR

<P>
The Legislature has given final passage to legislation earmarking about $1.2 
million in property tax revenues to the city of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) said the measure was necessary because 
under current law Diamond Bar, which incorporated last April, is not eligible 
to receive the property taxes until July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's bill was approved by the Assembly without debate Thursday on a 69-0 vote 
and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Senate approved the measure by a 32-0 margin, then 
rushed it to the Assembly for consideration before the spring recess, which 
began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters also sought quick passage because Hill is running for the Senate in 
a special election Tuesday. If he is elected, final action on the bill could 
have been delayed until another lawmaker was found to steer it through the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing law, Diamond Bar was required to be incorporated by Jan. 1, 
1989, to receive property tax revenues during the current fiscal year, which 
ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's bill would make the city immediately eligible for the money. 
</P>
<P>
Without the change, the city would have been incorporated for 13 months without 
receiving its annual share of property taxes to offset costs of providing 
services, according to the Senate analysis of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials objected to the bill, arguing that the city has 
other sources of revenue, such as sales taxes and motor vehicle license fees. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate analysis quoted county officials as saying: "In the era of limited 
fiscal resources, the county's local tax base is insufficient to finance local 
programs and state-mandated services. This bill would further aggravate the 
problem and increase the county's fiscal dependency on the state." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar officials said the city needs the money to pay for services. City 
officials estimated that at least 25% of the property tax revenues would go to 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Phyllis Papen, who was in Sacramento to lobby for the legislation, 
described the passage of the bill as signaling the end of the transition of 
Diamond Bar from a county-controlled area to a city.

3 CAR DEALERSHIPS CLOSED IN DISPUTE MAY BE REOPENED

<P>
Duarte Nissan Inc., which last month closed its three dealerships in the midst 
of a financial dispute, may reopen under new ownership, according to an 
Industry auto dealer who said he plans to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan Gittin, owner of Puente Hills Nissan, said he will meet Monday with 
Duarte Nissan Inc. officials to work out final details of his purchase of their 
Isuzu, Nissan and Suzuki dealerships in the Foothill (210) Freeway Autoplex. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll pretty much get this thing hammered out," Gittin said. "I'd be surprised 
if we're not up and running by the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Low, general manager of Duarte Nissan Inc., said he and his father, 
Robert Low, president of the company, have been negotiating with Gittin and 
other potential buyers. He refused to comment further. On Tuesday, an 
electronic business sign on the property said "Opening Soon." 
</P>
<P>
The businesses closed after the Isuzu and Nissan dealerships filed for 
reorganization of their debts and protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 employees lost their jobs, and several customers were left with 
unresolved complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing was not due to declining sales. In fact, car sales had 
surged since the businesses moved to Duarte. Last year, they sold 5,000 Isuzu 
and Nissan models for a total of $60 million, compared to 2,500 models sold in 
1988, when the businesses were in Arcadia, Low said. 
</P>
<P>
The dealerships generated $300,000 of the city's $1.65 million in sales tax 
revenue last year, and were expected to bring in $250,000 this fiscal year, 
Duarte City Manager Jesse Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
But the dealerships ran into a series of financial problems with their major 
creditor, Pasadena- based Tokai Credit Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the bankruptcy filing, Tokai sued the Duarte dealerships, 
alleging the Lows had "stolen" more than $8 million in inventory by pocketing 
proceeds from car sales instead of turning the money over to Tokai, which 
purchased inventory for the three dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Tokai also claimed the owners didn't make good faith efforts to sell the 
businesses after the bankruptcy filing and drove away prospective purchasers by 
demanding excessively high rents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tokai officials said the Lows owed them $666,000 under the 
post-bankruptcy agreement, but instead used the money to pay off sales tax 
debts incurred before declaring bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Tokai's suit, which sought to recover all of the remaining cash collateral from 
Duarte Nissan Inc., was settled when a federal bankruptcy judge ordered the 
dealerships to turn over their money to a trust account held jointly by Duarte 
Nissan Inc. and Tokai. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered the State Board of Equalization to return the $666,000 
to Tokai, to be placed in the account as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tokai officials would not specify whether they plan to take further legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Low has denied all the allegations. He claims Tokai violated its own part 
of the post-bankruptcy agreement, but he refused to provide any details to back 
up his charge. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Tokai removed 300 new and used cars from the three dealerships, 
located at the intersection of Central Avenue and Buena Vista Street. The cars 
were placed in storage and will be sold later by the credit corporation, said 
Tokai Senior Vice President Conrad Noriega.

COMPROMISE REACHED OVER USE OF NEON SIGN; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY AGREES TO PUT A 23-BY-8-FOOT SIGN ON A 
POLE NEXT TO THE CHATEAU ELYSEE HOTEL TO QUELL NEIGHBORS' PROTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Church of Scientology has reached a compromise with some of its neighbors 
over a large neon sign it wants to install on its landmark Chateau Elysee hotel 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 23-by-8-foot identification sign probably will be placed on a 
pole next to the hotel instead of on the roof of the 62-year-old building, as 
the church had been trying to do for at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
That original proposal had prompted opposition from some city officials and 
neighbors, who said such a big, bright sign would create a "visual blight" and 
deface one of Hollywood's most distinguished buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood-based church uses the castle-like structure as a "celebrity 
center," a facility to house celebrities and church members from around the 
world when they visit Scientology headquarters. The sign, designed to read 
"Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International" would be visible from 
the Hollywood Freeway and other nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
The church agreed to the compromise at a hearing Wednesday before the city's 
Cultural Heritage Commission, after commission members said they would not 
approve the rooftop sign because of the building's status as a historic and 
cultural monument. The massive hotel at the corner of Franklin Avenue and 
Tamarind Street was built in 1928 to resemble an 18th-Century French castle. In 
its heyday it served as a home to such celebrities as Clark Gable, Cary Grant, 
Humphrey Bogart and Ginger Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing at City Hall, Dr. Amarjit Marwah, commission president, 
noted that the church had been told at an earlier hearing to find a compromise. 
After a church planning executive, Kirk Steele, said the church still favored 
the original rooftop sign, Marwah expressed his disapproval. He said he favored 
an artist's rendition showing the sign on a pole just behind the hotel, on the 
roof of an adjacent underground garage. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks like a workable solution that would go through (the city approval 
process) very well," Marwah said. After Steele and a lawyer for the church 
balked, saying they would have to go back to the same city planners who had 
already given the sign their conditional approval, Marwah said: "I think the 
pole sign is the only one which seems feasible. I want to settle this today." 
</P>
<P>
"The commission wants to make sure the historic fabric of the building is kept 
intact," Marwah told the church officials. "Your message will still be there, 
it just won't be such a loud message." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Punt, assistant general manager for the Cultural Heritage Commission, 
referred to the original sign as "McDonald's-like" because of its height, color 
and prominence on the building. The compromise, he said, "serves the purpose, 
but it's not so glaring." 
</P>
<P>
The church officials finally agreed. The sign needs the approval of city 
planners, transportation engineers and building and safety officials, but 
Marwah said he would write to each department and urge them to support the 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Young, president of the Church of Scientology's Los Angeles chapter, 
said: "It's a pleasure to bring this to a compromise that makes everybody 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Roe Estes, zoning chairman of the Hollywood Hills Improvement Assn., which 
claims more than 200 members, was one of two people at the hearing who opposed 
the sign. "We would be happiest with no sign whatsoever," Estes said afterward. 
"But I'm delighted they are not destroying the integrity of the chateau-esque 
building." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, as well as the 520-member Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn., also 
opposed the rooftop sign. But more than a dozen other neighbors wrote city 
officials in support of the church, saying it has spent millions to renovate 
the hotel and that they don't mind the sign. 
</P>
<P>
The Scientology Church bought the hotel about 17 years ago, after it had been 
turned into a convalescent home and had fallen into disrepair.

<P>
The Senate on Thursday approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a bill to 
temporarily exempt cities in Los Angeles County from a tough new law designed 
to ensure orderly growth around airports. 
</P>
<P>
Current law, which took effect this year, requires the county to formulate 
comprehensive land-use plans for 17 airports by June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Until the plans are completed, the county must approve permits for major 
projects as far as two miles away from the airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, approved by a 32-1 margin, the county's deadline to complete 
the plans would be extended six months, and cities would be exempted from 
submitting a project-by-project review to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), who is carrying the bill, said it 
provides extra time for the county to prepare the plans to ensure that building 
projects near airports are compatible with flight traffic. The bill, supported 
by the League of California Cities, had already been approved by the Assembly.

Andy Wang recruited 15 human guinea pigs and asked each to memorize five 
Chinese characters while the electrodes he'd attached to their heads charted 
their brain waves. 
</P>
<P>
By measuring recordings from the occipital region and the scores of the 
memorization test, he figures to begin exploring, as he puts it, "the vast 
domain of these three pounds of universe, the brain." 
</P>
<P>
Holly Han worked on figuring out the chemical structure of lipofuscin pigment. 
"Since lipofuscin pigment is found in cells that are deteriorating, it could be 
related to cancer or aging factors such as wrinkling and baldness," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can someday develop a drug or chemical, inject it into a cell, clip off 
the lipids and shrink the size of the molecule and the body can wash it off. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Andy, 16, is a junior at Alhambra High School; Holly, 17, is a senior. Their 
projects were two of the entries at the Alhambra Science and Engineering Expo 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
If they become research scientists, their careers could easily stretch beyond 
the middle of the mid-21st Century. And by then, creating a computer whose 
thinking can grow and progress just as a baby's does, or a cure for cancer, or 
a fountain of youth, might seem as ordinary as pocket calculators and jet 
travel do today. 
</P>
<P>
Andy and Holly are among 80 students in the biomedical research class at 
Alhambra High School. They arrive at 7 a.m. three days a week to take part in 
the special program, led by Duane Nichols, chairman of Alhambra's science 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"In these four years," Nichols says, "we try to get them to do a lot of 
reading, some assigned, some of their own choosing . . . and research projects 
and research papers. They have to read and write and speak science. Oral 
presentations are a big part of the class. We find that when they have to teach 
something, then they know it better." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols has been teaching and advising the special program for 10 years, and he 
sees it as a way to motivate students already interested in the sciences, as 
well as to interest some who may not be sure. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my top seniors came in really unsure whether she liked science or not, 
really thought she hated it," Nichols says. That was Holly. 
</P>
<P>
Now, listen as she smoothly discourses about how malondialdehyde reacts with 
phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine in her project, "Synthesis, Isolation and 
Characterization of a Water-Soluble Fluorescent Product Related to Lipofuscin 
Pigment." 
</P>
<P>
Holly and David Le, another 17-year-old senior, were named Thursday as the top 
winners at the science fair. Thanks to a grant from the Alhambra Foundry, they 
will travel to the International Science and Engineering Fair in Tulsa in May. 
</P>
<P>
David's project, "Isolation of the Gene Encoding for the Neuropeptide Urotensin 
I and II from the Goby," consists of research on proteins from the saltwater 
fish that ultimately could aid human gene research. 
</P>
<P>
The judges were enthusiastic about the students' work. Larry Lim of the USC 
School of Engineering, a veteran high school science fair judge, called the 
Alhambra show "by far the best quality" of those he's seen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a better quality of experiments than some of the ones that have been 
at the county or state fairs," said Al Klascius of Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Some judges, though, lamented that most of the students seemed to want to be 
medical doctors rather than researchers, though they understood why. "There 
aren't many examples for a student to know what the life of a scientist is 
like," said John Petruska of the USC molecular biology department. "All of them 
know what the life of a doctor is like. You don't see a TV series about 
molecular biologist." 
</P>
<P>
One judge, Tinky Lai, is an alumna of the biomedical research class. A 1986 
Alhambra graduate, she's now a developmental psychology major at UCLA. "The 
competition is much more intense than when I was here," she says. "They're 
getting so much more sophisticated. The freshmen might be doing what we would 
do as juniors." 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra students, Nichols says proudly, have always excelled in science and 
math. In fact, Alhambra has had more winners in the Westinghouse Science Talent 
Search than any other California high school. 
</P>
<P>
But the California overall numbers are still far below those of eastern states 
like New York, Pennsylvania and Florida. So the state Education Department has 
allocated $30,000 to be parceled out in $500 grants to teachers who encourage 
students to participate in the prestigious national Westinghouse contest. As 
president of the California Biology Educators Assn., Nichols is in charge of 
disbursing that money to teachers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica native and graduate of Brigham Young University, Nichols has 
been at Alhambra High ever since he began teaching in 1968. His own love of 
science, and his inspiration to become a teacher came, he says, because "I 
loved what I learned from Mr. Brownsberger and Mr. Stark in science class at 
Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
"They made science fun and I just loved the things that we learned. We learned 
so much and had so much fun doing it." 
</P>
<P>
To hear his students tell it, Nichols is perpetuating that love of learning. 
Sophomore Paul Habib, 15, says he hadn't really thought about taking on such a 
heavy scientific load until a recruiter at his grade school talked up the 
biomedical research program at Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
He applied, was accepted, and for this year's project charted the reaction of 
male and female cockatiels to recorded sounds from other cockatiels and from 
different birds. 
</P>
<P>
Paul gets to school at 7 a.m. three days a week for the sessions. "At first," 
he says, "it was really boring and I was thinking of quitting. We did book 
reports and that was boring. But then the experiments were fun." 
</P>
<P>
Now in his second year, it's still hard to wake up those early mornings. "You 
want to sleep," he says, "but you know you better get there or you miss 
information." Paul says he always planned to be a dentist, "but you never know. 
I might be testing birds."

West Hollywood voters are getting a flurry of last-minute mailers, phone calls 
and hand-delivered flyers as nine City Council candidates make their final 
pitches for votes for Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
With three seats up for grabs, voters will determine a majority on the 
five-member council, which has been dominated by the Campaign for Economic 
Survival, architect of the city's rent control ordinance, since incorporation 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But with no other pressing issues, many observers expect the turnout among the 
city's 20,000 voters to be low. 
</P>
<P>
CES-backed candidate John Heilman is the only incumbent in the race; council 
members Helen Albert and Steve Schulte decided not to seek reelection. Heilman, 
who has served on the council since incorporation, and fellow CES-backed 
candidate Babette Lang, 77, are running a joint campaign and are considered 
front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to make strong showings are Sal Guarriello, 71, who is backed by 
CES but has run a separate campaign; Steve Martin, 35, an attorney who is 
backed by Schulte, and Robert K. Davis, 44, a swimming pool contractor with 
strong support on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include John O'Brien, 41, a gay activist; the Rev. John W. 
VonDouris, 44, a member of the United Lesbian and Gay Christian Scientists; 
John C. (Jack) Reilly, 55, a retired teacher, and Jim Sorkin, 37, an actor and 
house painter. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions for the filing period ending in March showed that 
Heilman had raised $17,809, Lang $11,370, Martin $24,469, Guarriello $15,939, 
and Davis $11,548. Reilly reported no contributions. None of the other 
candidates had filed papers that are required for contributions over $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
A political action committee for the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees' Local 3339, the union representing the city's 90 workers, 
reported raising $3,700 in contributions to support three candidates it 
endorsed: Guarriello, Martin and Lang. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout much of the campaign, Heilman has been criticized by other 
candidates for being pro-development and for supporting a failed referendum in 
November on construction of a $23-million Civic Center in West Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also criticized Heilman for approving a deal with hotelier Severyn 
Ashkenazy that allowed Ashkenazy to convert 200 apartments to hotel rooms in 
exchange for paying the city $250,000 a year for 20 years to replace the lost 
housing and guaranteeing not to evict about 40 tenants. 
</P>
<P>
And Martin and other candidates have attacked Lang's position as a 
tenant-rights advocate because she has owned apartment buildings; a Martin 
mailer accused Lang of being a slumlord. "She is a former real estate 
speculator and slumlord," Martin said when asked about the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
Lang, a practicing psychologist, said she was once a landlord but added: "I am 
absolutely outraged. This is the biggest pack of lies that I have ever heard. 
We ran good, clean buildings. We didn't gouge the tenants and we were not 
slumlords." 
</P>
<P>
She said the buildings were never cited for health code violations and were 
sold seven years ago. "The experience of being a landlord gave me a better 
perspective on the issues involving tenants and made me a stronger supporter of 
renters' rights." 
</P>
<P>
Heilman and Lang, in their first mailer last month, accused Martin of being 
"the landlord's No. 1 candidate." The mailer accused Martin of writing an 
article opposing rent control in a landlord's magazine in October, 1984. 
Martin, who serves on the rent stabilization commission along with Lang and 
Guarriello, denies ever writing the article, which was published under his 
byline. 
</P>
<P>
Two mailers by the AFSCME local attacking Heilman sparked criticism of the 
union's leaders by city workers who accused their union of acting without 
consulting the rank and file. The union, which has accused Heilman of being 
pro-management, raised dues last year with the goal of taking a more active 
role in the election. 
</P>
<P>
But union members last week protested their leadership's support of a slate of 
candidates, including Guarriello, whose campaign is being managed by a union 
vice president. A petition protesting the endorsements was signed by 54 
members, more than half the local. Guarriello said the union's actions were 
being orchestrated by Heilman supporters and CES, which was not pleased with 
his recent attacks on Heilman. Guarriello later apologized for comments against 
CES, one of his major supporters, saying that "in the heat of my current 
political campaign, I made a remark . . . that I regret." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his CES endorsement, Guarriello, a retired insurance agent, has been 
campaigning against the current council, including Heilman. "There has been too 
much development in the city and it has to be slowed down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has accused the city of not doing enough to revitalize the east end of 
town, where he draws much of his support. He accused the city of trying to 
"trash" the east side by putting a shelter for the homeless on La Brea Avenue. 
"They're trying to litter the city with vagrants, derelicts and drug addicts," 
said Davis, who has called for the creation of more affordable housing in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Heilman and Lang's most recent mailer saying that they are the 
only candidates in the race openly opposed to gambling has sparked another 
controversy, including criticism that they accepted money from supporters of 
legalized gambling who want to put a gambling club in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gould, general manager of the West Hollywood Club, also known as the 
Cavendish, said he wrote checks to Lang, Guarriello, Heilman and Martin. 
</P>
<P>
But all four candidates say they do not support legalized gambling and deny 
that they received checks from Gould. They each said they would not accept his 
contributions had he made one. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows who the candidates are who are ahead, so he is going to try to give 
money to everyone," Heilman said. "They are trying to buy their way into the 
city. Well, he can take his money and shove it."

C.W. CAMP, HISTORIAN FOR LA MIRADA, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA MIRADA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials, developers or just plain folks with historical questions about 
the city usually went to C.W. (Bob) Camp. A self-taught historian, Camp had the 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
"He had all the (historical) maps and research. He could tell you if there was 
a water well or oil well on the land," Dave Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's historian for more than 30 years, Camp died April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, a professor of political science and a veteran member of the La Mirada 
City Council, said the city valued Camp's ability so much that he was appointed 
city historian in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Camp was given a stipend of $50 a month as the official historian of this 
residential city of 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
"When developers had questions, they could have gotten the information from the 
city administrative staff, but we sent them to Bob because he was faster. He 
had much of the information in his head," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of artifacts and memorabilia he collected are stored at the Neff 
House and George Home, historic sites located in Neff Park in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The items are farming equipment, including hammers, saws and shovels used in 
the 1800s on the 2,300-acre Los Coyotes Rancho that would later become La 
Mirada. The city was incorporated in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Camp was instrumental in having the Neff and George homes listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The homes were built in the late 
1800s by Andrew McNally of the Rand McNally map-making company. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 24 years, Camp conducted tours through the houses that he fought 
to preserve, said Sheila Krotinger, chairwoman of the city's Historical 
Committee that Camp established in 1960 to protect historical sites. 
</P>
<P>
Camp received many honors for his efforts, including an award of merit in 1988 
from the California Historical Society for the preservation of local history. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chattanooga, Tenn., he moved to Norwalk in 1949, then to La Mirada in 
1957 and immediately started his collection. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted in a local newspaper a couple of years ago on why he was interested in 
history, Camp said, "I do it for self-satisfaction. It is rewarding. I didn't 
make my bread and butter doing this." 
</P>
<P>
He was a manager and administrator for a Los Angeles electrical supply company. 
He was the author of a book, "La Mirada: From Rancho to City," and co-author of 
another one, "The City of La Mirada, A Silver Anniversary History." 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote, "They Walked Before Us," an unpublished novel about the city and 
the Indians of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Camp wrote more than 50 articles on city history. Most of the features appeared 
in the Lamplighter, a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The historian's full name was Clarence William Camp but he preferred to be 
called Bob, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
They describe him as a quiet and serious person who tried to answer all 
questions put to him about the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was one question he was never able to answer. Several years ago, 
a letter writer asked Camp if his home was located on Indian burial grounds. 
The writer said an Indian ghost occupied the house. 
</P>
<P>
"He was polite but he couldn't answer the question," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old historian died of an aneurysm at La Mirada Community Hospital. 
His wife, Iris, died five years ago. Survivors include two sons, a daughter and 
11 grandchildren.

CHILDREN OF WAR ON MISSION OF PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine young people from Children of War, a youth leadership group with chapters 
in 15 U.S. cities, visited John Muir High School in Pasadena Monday and 
Tuesday. They were among 48 youths from war-torn countries, refugee communities 
and U.S. inner cities who are touring the country to tell their stories. 
</P>
<P>
The tour, which began March 17 and ends today, includes youths from Northern 
Ireland, Lebanon, Israel, South Africa and Cambodia. In all, 15 Children of War 
representatives are visiting the Los Angeles area. Pasadena is the only San 
Gabriel Valley stop on their tour. Other young people from the organization are 
speaking in Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel proud I have the freedom I have," remarked Muir ninth-grader 
Herbie Judware, after hearing 14-year-old Margaret Leosevich of Chernobyl, 
Byelorussia, talk about the nuclear accident and government restrictions in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Children of War was created in 1984 by the New York-based interfaith Religious 
Task Force. Its members are between the ages of 15 and 22. The nonprofit group 
paid round-trip travel expenses for the 20 young people who traveled to America 
for the speaking tour, and is picking up tour-related expenses for the 28 
others. The youths receive no compensation, but Children of War organizers say 
their programs give the young people "incredible leadership training." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is scared out of their wits at the growth of drug and gang problems, 
and the general despair and alienation of our young people," said the Rev. Paul 
Mayer, the task force's director, in explaining why the program is welcomed in 
schools and communities. Children of War will be following up on the tour with 
leadership training workshops at each of the sites visited.

'DESIGNER HOTEL' OPENS AS SAN DIEGO VACANCIES SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aventine, the Michael Graves-designed hotel-office-restaurant complex in La 
Jolla that held its grand opening Saturday, has already attracted some 
irreverent nicknames, including "Big Toast," "Old Radio" and "Tombstone." 
</P>
<P>
The nicknames, all of which refer to the distinctive roof line that architect 
Graves designed for the 400-room Hyatt Regency hotel portion of the 
$150-million project overlooking Interstate 5, are a measure of the project's 
distinction. San Diego, with its plain-vanilla skyline, has never seen anything 
like it. 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether Aventine can attract hotel guests and office 
tenants as readily as nicknames, a formidable task in light of San Diego's 
overbuilt hotel and office markets. Vacancies in office buildings in Aventine's 
neighborhood are pushing 40%, while San Diego County's average hotel vacancy 
rate in January hit its highest level in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Aventine's financial future is in doubt. As with so many other recent 
Southern California office and resort developments, Aventine was built with 
financing from Japanese investors who can afford to wait patiently for the 
project to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no question that Aventine is opening at a less-than-propitious 
time. The guest room count in San Diego County swelled by 37% in four years as 
the hotel industry geared up for last November's opening of the San Diego 
Convention Center. And office construction in the city's so-called Golden 
Triangle -- Aventine's neighborhood -- shows no sign of abating, despite the 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Aventine's developers are hoping that the Graves-signature design will 
be a significant asset in the competition for office tenants and weekend 
tourists, most of whom come to San Diego seeking a room on or near a beach. 
(Aventine is 1 mile from the shore.) In fact, the Aventine is positioning 
itself as the area's first "designer hotel." Aventine Hyatt General Manager 
Steven Pelzer said his hotel's "major amenity" is that it is the work of a 
"celebrity architect." Each of the hotel's rooms and common spaces are 
ornamented with distinctive Graves furniture and fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
If the project does make a meaningful architectural contribution to San Diego, 
much of the credit belongs to Aventine developer Jack Naiman, who has built 
several million square feet of office buildings as well as a chain of upscale 
health spas called Sporting Clubs of America. 
</P>
<P>
Naiman, an art collector and classical civilization buff, said in an interview 
that he intended all along to create a landmark on the 11.7-acre parcel at 
Interstate 5 and La Jolla Village Drive that he bought in 1984. At the time, 
the parcel was considered among the most desirable undeveloped sites in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain an appropriately monumental design, Naiman held a mini design 
competition between two of the country's most distinguished architects, Graves 
of Princeton, N.J., and I. M. Pei of New York. Naiman's instructions to the 
designers were to create "something romantic" but with a Roman flavor, hence 
the name Aventine, one of the seven hills of ancient Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Graves won the competition with a startling design that is a Postmodern 
treatment of a number of Italian architectural icons, Naiman said, including 
medieval siege towers, Umbrian villas and the cathedral campaniles. The 
design's principal elements were the 15-story hotel, a 228,000-square-foot 
office component, a sprawling health club and four restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Equally as striking as the hotel's roof line is Graves' office element, 
composed of three parts connected by a common lobby: a six-story palazzo, an 
11-story tower and a campanile (or bell tower) of similar height, an unabashed 
knock-off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. 
</P>
<P>
But the project almost died because Naiman couldn't nail down financing. During 
a two-year period, virtually every California lender turned him down. There 
were several reasons but, in general, banks were leery about funding a project 
that combined disparate elements such as hotels and offices in an 
interdependent whole, Naiman said. 
</P>
<P>
One lender who asked not to be identified said that his bank was also concerned 
that Aventine was located too far -- about a mile -- from the University Towne 
Centre shopping mall and its expanding node of adjacent office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Aventine was at the far edge of the whole process," the lender said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the office portion of the project opens this month with only 15% of 
the space leased, a relatively low figure, although project spokespersons say 
additional leases totaling another 15% of the space will soon be signed. 
</P>
<P>
There also were concerns that Aventine's hotel might have difficulty competing 
for weekend guests against La Jolla's water-oriented hotels, and that 
Aventine's 2,000-member Sporting Club of America element was too expensive for 
nearby residents who are seen as the primary market. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it took Japanese money to get the project off the ground. In 1987, 
Naiman announced that he had taken on three Japanese equity partners: Shimizu 
Corp., one of Japan's largest general contractors; the Nissho Iwai trading 
company, which had worldwide 1988 revenue of $83 billion, and real estate 
investor TSA International. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese equity partners helped arrange a construction loan from Long Term 
Credit Bank of Japan and construction began in spring, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Shimizu nor TSA were strangers to big-ticket U.S. real estate deals. 
One of Japan's "Big Five" construction companies with revenues in excess of $7 
billion, Shimizu bought a minority interest in Dillingham Construction of 
Pleasanton, Calif., in 1987 and subsequently signed a joint venture deal with 
Beverly Enterprises of Pasadena to build a chain of nursing homes in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu is also an investor in the $200-million Great American Plaza 
office-hotel project now under construction in downtown San Diego, as well as a 
$400-million redevelopment project in Santa Ana that includes two office towers 
and a hotel. Shimizu is also a partner in the $55-million Ritz-Carlton resort 
under construction in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
TSA International, a Honolulu-based real estate investment company headed by 
Japanese deal maker Takeshi Sekiguchi, has major stakes in Westin hotels on the 
islands of Maui and Kauai as well as the 1,400-room Hyatt Waikoloa on the 
island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, TSA International became a major investor in the 560-room Four 
Seasons Aviara resort planned for Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the challenge of building Aventine has been overcome, the one of 
making it a profitable property lies ahead. No one feels that challenge more 
keenly than Steven Pelzer, general manager of Aventine's Hyatt Regency hotel, 
which must compete in an increasingly crowded San Diego County market in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented boom in hotel construction since 1985, a bump in inventory 
that has proceeded much faster than room demand, resulted in San Diego County's 
average hotel occupancy rate dipping to 53.7% in January. That's traditionally 
a slow month for local hoteliers, but nevertheless the occupancy rate was the 
lowest in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla market in particular has toughened with the opening of the 
Aventine Hyatt in January and the 400-room Sheraton Grand at Torrey Pines last 
November. In addition, a 210-room Ritz-Carlton is scheduled to open in late 
1991 near UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 40 architectural projects that Graves is currently involved 
with, several are located in Southern California, including the Walt Disney 
corporate office nearing completion in Burbank, the Metropolis master-planned 
redevelopment in Los Angeles, the Venice public library and the Institute for 
Theoretical Physics building at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Graves also designed the controversial Swan and Dolphin hotels at Disney World 
in Orlando, Fla. The 760-room Swan opened in January and the 1,500-room Dolphin 
is set to open in June. A spokeswoman for Graves said the Aventine Hyatt is the 
architect's first hotel design actually to be built.

CULVER CITY: ONCE MOSTLY COVERED BY STUDIO BACK LOTS, CITY HAS RETAINED 
SMALL-TOWN ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE OF ITS STABILITY, LOW CRIME RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL TICE, Tice was born in Culver City and has lived there for the last 10 
years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Dan Patacchia moved to Culver City in 1948, MGM's back lots still covered 
much of the city. "There were elephants, horses, covered wagons -- even a lake 
for the Tarzan movies," Patacchia recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the show business glitz, Patacchia said, "It was a quiet town. Most 
people would go to the parks and have picnics, or go to the beaches, or take a 
drive just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Although the back lots have disappeared in the years since Patacchia paid 
$13,000 for his two-bedroom Culver City home, the 73-year-old former mayor 
said, "It still has the small-town atmosphere. Every day, I see so many people 
I know on a first-name basis." 
</P>
<P>
One reason Culver City has kept its small-town character may be its relatively 
stable size -- while Los Angeles County added more than 1 million people last 
year, Culver City has gained only 9,000 residents in the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Located on Los Angeles' Westside between Baldwin Hills and the Mar Vista-Palms 
area, Culver City's population is now just over 41,000, many of them longtime 
residents such as Patacchia. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Culver Park Realty for 40 years, Patacchia notes that with home 
prices skyrocketing, "People are renovating rather than reselling. They like 
Culver City, and they want to stay. Two houses across from me have added second 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard and Valerie Loo are nearing completion on a $110,000 second-story 
addition to their 1950s Culver City home.

<P>
When they purchased the 1,000-square-foot home in July, 1988, the couple, both 
in their 30s, were commuting up to 18 hours a week from Montebello to jobs on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the attraction is my 3 1/2-mile drive to work and the privacy," Loo 
said. "Nobody knows about Culver City, and the people that do are going, 
'Shhh!' " 
</P>
<P>
The Loos began construction last June on the addition, which adds 700 square 
feet, including a master bedroom, bathroom and a spa. 
</P>
<P>
Although weary of the chaos and debris of remodeling, Loo said, "The house is a 
lot more comfortable than it was. Also, the neighborhood's extremely friendly. 
People came over and introduced themselves, and helped us move in." 
</P>
<P>
Friendly neighbors were a big factor in Anne Finestone's attraction to her 
$415,000 three-bedroom, two-bath Culver City home. 
</P>
<P>
Finestone, 32, aeronautics administrator, was unfamiliar with Culver City, as 
was husband Charles Dolan, 30, a computer scientist. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked in other areas at $375,000 to 390,000 houses, a lot of them in really 
shabby condition," Finestone said. "I decided I didn't want to do a fixer, no 
matter what. Then I drove by and saw this house, came in here, and it was all 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I like best of all is the feeling of neighborhood, that people know 
who you are. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I checked into was the crime rate. I'm always coming 
home late from class or meetings, so it's important to me." 
</P>
<P>
The crime statistics for Culver City are so favorable that Don Reitzfeld, the 
Fred Sands realtor who sold Finestone and Dolan their house, gives prospective 
buyers a copy of the figures. 
</P>
<P>
While surrounding Los Angeles suffered an explosion in crime, Culver City 
enjoyed a 34% drop in crime during the 1980s. "Police and fire protection is 
tops," Reitzfeld said. "It's a nice place to be and it's still underrated -- 
you can get a lot more for your money here." 
</P>
<P>
According to Reitzfeld, the city's bargains are to be found in the eastern part 
of town, near the old Helms bakery building and McManus Park, where a 
two-bedroom fixer home recently listed for $275,000. Large condominium 
complexes such as Tara Hill are still affordable -- three-bedroom condos start 
as low as $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Reitzfeld's own Lindberg Park area, one-story homes start in the 
mid-$300,000s. In Culver City's most prestigious area, hilly Culver Crest, 
homes start at $400,000 and go up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reitzfeld, 34, who has been selling real estate in the area for 10 years, 
bought his third Culver City property in June, 1988, for $240,000. One week 
later he tore the 1,000-square-foot house down "almost to the ground" and spent 
$120,000 transforming it into a two story, 2,300-square-foot Cape Cod-style 
home with five bedrooms and three baths. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling was not Reitzfeld's first choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been looking for over a year for a house around $400,000 in a desirable 
location, and nothing ever came up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight-month construction period, Reitzfeld recalled, "It wasn't fun. I 
was practically living there, because I was the general contractor and had to 
wait around for contractors not to show up. I'm glad I did it, I'm glad it's 
over and I'll never do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Reitzfeld, his wife, Laura, and sons Wesley, 4, and Dustin, 6, recently 
celebrated their one-year anniversary in the finished house. The family 
participates in a child-care co-op in nearby Lindberg Park and helped organize 
a neighborhood get-acquainted party. Dustin attends Farragut Elementary, one of 
Culver City's three highly regarded primary schools. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Reitzfeld sold Jeff Sacharow and Sara Wasserstein their Culver City 
home. Now, they are expecting a baby -- and a remodel. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had filed plans in December, 1988, for a second-story addition to 
their 1,000-square-foot house near Coombs Park, but when the contractor's bid 
came in $70,000 higher than expected, the couple shelved the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in September, 1989, Wasserstein discovered she was pregnant and due in 
May. The fall was spent looking for a larger Culver City house in move-in 
condition. Finding nothing, in mid-January Sacharow and Wasserstein began 
planning a more modest remodel of their 1948 house. 
</P>
<P>
"Remodeling is the more affordable thing to do to get the space you want," 
Wasserstein said. "The scaled-back plan is just to add a master bedroom and 
bath at the back of the house and redo the kitchen to some extent. Our 
frustration is that we didn't start earlier. Now we want to wait until the baby 
is a few months old." 
</P>
<P>
Sacharow and Wasserstein purchased the home for $153,500 after three years of 
living in a rented Culver City duplex. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, we'd grown real accustomed to this area," Sacharow said. "We 
walk around the neighborhood a lot, often at night. We basically feel safe 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Wasserstein, 30, said, "If we found a good three-bedroom here, we'd still buy 
it. But we've come to the conclusion that we want to stay in Culver City." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly and Efrem Violin are another Culver City couple who won't be leaving 
town. "This is our first home, and it will probably be our only home," Beverly 
Violin said. "I can't imagine moving. It's the people that keep me here -- the 
friendships we've made." 
</P>
<P>
The couple bought their 1950s tract house for $29,000 in 1965, and have been 
active in a number of community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"One advantage we have in Culver City is the opportunity to participate in 
local government," she said. "Efrem almost never misses a City Council 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are extremely accessible -- Mayor Jozelle Smith has calls to 
City Hall referred to her home number. 
</P>
<P>
Over breakfast at the Roll 'N Rye, a recently remodeled 27-year-old Culver City 
landmark, Smith outlined the city's improvement plans, including four new 
restaurants near the Corporate Pointe business development and townhouses to be 
built on the site of the Studio Drive-In. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, city offices are in temporary buildings while a new City Hall and 
fire station are built, and on the horizon is an overhaul of Culver City's 
downtown, which includes restoration of the Culver Theater and the triangular 
Culver Hotel, built in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
The town's block-long Main Street is also slated for a face lift. On the 
northwest corner of Main Street, the two-story building that served as 
developer Harry Culver's real estate office still stands. In 1913, Culver 
purchased the barley and bean fields that were part of Agustin Machado's 
original Spanish land grant, Rancho La Ballona, and vowed to build his "dream 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attempted to annex Culver City in 1914, but all 59 residents voted 
against it; the city was incorporated in 1917. Culver City's movie history 
dates to 1915, when filmmaker Thomas Ince built Triangle Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stayed with our motto, 'The Heart of Screenland,' " Mayor Smith said, 
"because a lot of the film people are still here." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who recently added a second story to her own Culver Crest home, notes 
that Culver City's remodeling boom has sparked new legislation to control 
"mansionizing" by setting limits on height and lot coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Next door to one immense remodel, Smith says, "The neighbor has to have her 
kitchen light on all the time -- it's blocked out the sun." 
</P>
<P>
But to Beverly Violin, the remodelers are bringing new life to Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"The young couples who are moving in make it very exciting," she said. "These 
people are revitalizing and adding a new dimension to the city -- and it's a 
good sign."

SAM HALL KAPLAN: MAKING CHILD'S PLAY A PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a group of UCLA architecture and planning students on a class assignment 
last year asked residents of the Nickerson Gardens public housing project in 
South-Central Los Angeles what design problem they would like them to address, 
the answer was near unanimous: 
</P>
<P>
"We told them something must be done for the children," said longtime resident 
Nora King. "They are our future, our hope." 
</P>
<P>
King noted that nearly half of the project's 5,000 residents are under the age 
of 12, and that if they are to avoid the gangs and drugs that had consumed many 
in the preceding generation, their needs had to be addressed and their energies 
focused. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents didn't want some grandiose architectural scheme that would be 
unbuildable," said student Shirl Buss. 
</P>
<P>
"What they were telling us . . . was that somehow within the constraints of the 
harsh realities of Nickerson, they wanted a better environment for their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The more specific answer that evolved from a series of resident surveys and 
workshops was a proposal to redesign, renovate and provide quality supervision 
for 15 tot lots in the project. 
</P>
<P>
All had fallen into disrepair, due in part to poor maintenance, lack of 
supervision, unimaginative design and siting, and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly isn't the highest item on the (Los Angeles city) Housing 
Authority agenda," King said. "They have a lot of fixing up of apartments to 
do. But we feel the children need a place of their own where they can feel 
secure, be challenged by the equipment, have proper supervision and enjoy 
themselves; where they can be kids." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the residents -- working through the nonprofit Nickerson Gardens 
Community Development Corp. and with the help of UCLA -- have gotten about 
$50,000 in grants (from the Housing Authority and Arco, among others) to start 
work on the first two lots. 
</P>
<P>
A total of about $500,000 is needed for the 15. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the residents' council in support of the project, the 
tot lots are "part of a much larger vision encompassing grass-roots residential 
involvement, better supervision of children, job and job training options, and 
maintenance of the overall public housing grounds." 
</P>
<P>
However, the residents understand well that the key to their goal of increased 
"community interaction and empowerment" is the concern for the children. They 
see the children as their legacy; that they as parents might not be able to 
rise above their present circumstances, but given the proper protection and 
opportunity their children might. 
</P>
<P>
This concern for the children in Nickerson Gardens is heartening, given the 
myriad problems of poverty and powerlessness that afflict the low-income 
housing project -- and the seemingly lack of concern most elsewhere to better 
shape the cityscape for children. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that as Los Angeles continues to grow, its environment has 
become more and more hostile to children. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the many parks that have been abandoned to the homeless and drug 
dealers, and the playgrounds that have been left to decay or been closed 
because of meager municipal funds and the fear of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Gone also -- for housing and parking lots, for makeshift garbage dumps or 
simply fenced off to keep out whomever -- are the vacant pieces of land that 
for generations in the past were makeshift adventure playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Here in these cracks and crevices of the cityscape, children with a sense of 
freedom and some scrap and imagination, could create their own world. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the streets that because of the crush of traffic no longer can 
serve as impromptu playing fields, the sidewalks that have been mauled by 
street widenings and curb cuts for driveways and parking lots and the alleys 
that have been turned into nasty shortcuts for careening cars. Pushed aside in 
the process have been the children. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when a new housing proposal is being reviewed by a city, the focus 
usually is on how many parking spaces are needed. Rarely have I heard in 
planning commission debates questions on how many children might live there, 
and where would they play. 
</P>
<P>
That uncovered parking and setbacks for garbage cans and dumpsters are 
considered in most zoning codes as "open space" makes a farce of the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder there is a graffiti problem, known on the street as "tagging." 
Besides being an exercise of sorts of freedom and adventure, tagging, I am 
convinced, is a statement by the youth that the streets and alleys also belong 
to them; that they are not altogether invisible, as much as the adult world 
would like them to be. 
</P>
<P>
What they are saying, in effect, with their spray cans is that "I tag, 
therefore I am." 
</P>
<P>
"The bland, monotonous, if not brutal environment of many of our cities and 
towns represent a form of sensory deprivation for children, with little to 
engage their fantasy, curiosity or affection," observed urbanologists Henry and 
Suzanne Lennard in a recent issue of their Making Cities Livable Newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Could it be . . . the very powerlessness of children makes it easy to fail to 
provide the conditions for their mental and emotional development?" ask the 
Lennards in the newsletter (published by the Center for Urban Well-Being in 
Carmel). 
</P>
<P>
The Lennards also deplore the neglect of children in the planning process, 
noting that "traffic kills and maims thousands of children, but the creation of 
traffic reduced zones and the promotion of less hazardous forms of 
transportation receive little interest." 
</P>
<P>
They and others such as urbanist William Whyte and UCLA planner Jacqueline 
Leavitt urge the shaping of an urban environment that, besides providing 
attractive and engaging parks and playgrounds, would allow children to safely 
explore and enjoy their neighborhoods and cities. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that a city, in effect, should be thought of as an outdoor 
playroom. 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts reflect a similar spirit that flourished too briefly in planning 
and design circles 20 years ago. There was then quite a bit of experimenting in 
open and community school concepts, fanciful playground equipment and generally 
a public realm that embraced children, be it in a shop-front school in a mall, 
a water fountain to romp through or closing streets for a few hours or on 
weekends to create play areas. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the efforts in time were crushed by timid school and park 
administrators, prosaic parents and officials, and the drying up and diversion 
of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
But as evidenced in the tot lot proposal for Nickerson Gardens, the recent 
formation of a regional parks confederation, the rumblings in the venerable 
Sierra Club for a more active urban open space program, the proposal for the 
Children's Museum downtown to be expanded into a Children's Plaza, and 
generally in the talk among concerned parents, there is the hope for a more 
child-friendly environment. 
</P>
<P>
As Nora King said, the children are our future. To which I add that this is 
their city too, and that we should be at least as considerate of our children 
as we are of our cars.

BIG LOTS VS. 'SKINNIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am glad that the Real Estate section is finally giving some coverage to the 
"tall and skinny" housing controversy that is boiling over in Hermosa Beach and 
Redondo Beach (Letters, April 1). 
</P>
<P>
However, I must take exception to the unfair statement made by writer Kathleen 
Parsons that all the tall and skinny 19-foot-wide houses have "taken from us is 
a bunch of dilapidated boxes with poorly maintained yards." I consider that an 
insult to all the fine people who live in homes on the 50-foot-wide lots. 
</P>
<P>
I invite her to drive down my street, the 1800 block of Harper in Hermosa 
Beach. The tall and skinny homes on my block are much more in need of paint and 
have many more weeds in their yards than do the homes on the big lots. 
</P>
<P>
She states that the 19-foot-wide houses are "built for today's way of life." 
Maybe so, but I have my home on a 50-foot-wide lot for sale now and almost 
everyone who comes to see it lives in a "tall and skinny" and wants to move 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Even Redondo Beach Councilwoman Kay Horrell has publicly stated that the city 
"screwed up" in allowing past zoning variations that led to so much increased 
density. 
</P>
<P>
I wish Parsons had mentioned that she is a salesperson for Anastasi Builders, a 
company that has torn down many homes on 50-foot-wide lots in the beach 
communities, and erected two 19-foot-wide homes in their place. I think that 
bit of news would have put her comments on "tall and skinny" houses in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter, Kathleen Parsons did mention that she was a realtor who had 
sold many "tall and skinnies." That fact was inadvertently edited from her 
letter. Parsons confirmed by telephone that she works for Anastasi Builders, 
but added: "I bought one of those 'tall and skinny' houses because it fit my 
lifestyle, not because I, in any way, was trying to promote myself or 
Anastasi."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: FHA NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING ALL HOME DEFECTS DURING 
APPRAISAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: When I bought my home, the FHA sent out an inspector who thoroughly 
checked out the house before approving my FHA mortgage. But now, severe cracks 
have become apparent in the foundation. Do you think the FHA should pay for the 
repairs, since the FHA inspector failed to report them? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No. When a mortgage lender sends an appraiser to evaluate a home before 
a loan is made, the appraiser is there to estimate the home's market value. The 
person sent by the FHA lender to evaluate your home was most likely an 
appraiser, not an inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Although FHA and VA can be especially demanding about having necessary home 
repairs completed before the mortgage is approved, these lenders are not 
guarantors of the home. A lender merely loans money secured by the property. 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage lender does not take the responsibility of guaranteeing the 
soundness of the residence. That would be an awesome job that would require 
charging high interest rates and hiring personnel much more skilled than most 
appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
If your home is relatively new, the home builder may be liable to you for the 
cost of repairing the foundation. Better yet, if the home builder provided a 
third-party warranty, such as one from Home Owner's Warranty Corp. (HOW), then 
HOW will take care of the repairs if the builder is unable to do so. 
Incidentally, these third-party warranties are usually only provided by top 
quality builders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing Home Buy With Building Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a small neighborhood combination office and store building in which I 
have about $350,000 net equity. That would buy a very nice home for me. Is 
there any way I can trade my building for a house without having to pay tax on 
my profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. But you will need to be flexible. To qualify for an IRC 1031 
tax-deferred exchange, both properties must be "like kind." That means they 
must be held for investment or for use in a trade or business. However, like 
kind does not mean "same kind." You can trade your income property for a rental 
house that is rented to tenants. But you cannot trade it for a personal 
residence, since it is not like kind. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to exchange your building for a rental house. Later on, you can 
convert the rental house into your personal residence. However, to qualify for 
a tax-deferred exchange you must trade up to a more valuable property without 
receiving any taxable "unlike kind" personal property such as cash or net 
mortgage relief. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replacement Home in Foreign Country 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are well over 55, so we qualify for that $125,000 "old 
folks" tax break you often discuss. However, our home sale profit will be at 
least $200,000. Some time ago you told another over-55 seller that he could 
avoid tax on such a sale by purchasing a replacement home. If we do that, can 
we buy a home in a less expensive foreign country, such as Mexico or must it be 
in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, it can be in a foreign country. Let me give an example of how you can 
combine the "over 55 rule" with the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of 
Internal Revenue Code 1034, which is available to home sellers of any age. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose your principal residence sells for $275,000 net sales price and you 
have a $200,000 profit (which means $75,000 is your adjusted cost basis). 
Subtracting your $125,000 "over 55 rule" exemption from the $275,000 net or 
adjusted sales price produces a $150,000 "revised adjusted sales price." 
</P>
<P>
If you buy a replacement principal residence costing at least $150,000 in this 
example within 24 months before or after the sale, you can then defer the tax 
on the remainder of your sale profit. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement home can be in a foreign country if you wish. Please consult 
your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seller Financing Usually Good for Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been offered a house to buy, but the seller wants to carry back the 
mortgage. The price is not a bargain, but it isn't overpriced either. Although 
the seller says she will carry the mortgage for five years, I think I can talk 
her into a 10-year term. Are there any disadvantages of seller financing of 
which I should be aware? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are many advantages and virtually no disadvantages to seller 
financing. The difficult part is finding sellers who realize the advantages for 
them. I find the best candidates for seller financing are elderly home sellers 
of vacant homes who need extra retirement income at a higher yield than can be 
safely earned elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Seller financing advantages for buyers include easy financing, no loan 
qualifying by a tough lender, competitive interest rate, flexible terms, such 
as interest only, quick closing with minimum paper work and no loan costs. 
There really aren't any disadvantages of seller financing for the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beware of Tax Cost in Selling Your Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home for about $90,000 several years ago. Today, is it worth 
around $220,000. About a year ago, we refinanced it for $160,000. We plan to 
sell our home and rent an apartment that will be much less expensive. Will our 
profit tax be figured on the $60,000 difference between $220,000 and $160,000 
or the $130,000 difference between $220,000 and $90,000? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have bad news. Your taxable profit will be the $130,000 difference between 
your $220,000 adjusted (net) sales price and your $90,000 adjusted cost basis. 
To make matters worse, you have an "excess mortgage" of about $70,000 ($160,000 
minus $90,000), which is money you received when you refinanced, but you will 
owe tax on it at the time of sale. 
</P>
<P>
Although you may save money by renting an apartment, the $36,400 tax on at 
least 28% of your $130,000 profit, and considering that you will only receive 
about $60,000 of net cash from the sale, makes the sale of your home without 
buying a qualifying replacement an undesirable situation. Before you sell, 
please consult your tax adviser. 
</P>

Why Financing Vacant Land Is So Difficult 
</P>
<P>
Q: I found a parcel of vacant land that should go up in value substantially 
over the next five years. But I am having trouble finding a mortgage lender who 
will finance my purchase from an estate that refuses to carry the mortgage. Any 
ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: Now you know why land investing is so risky. A major problem is the lack of 
financing. Most banks, S&amp;Ls and other lenders refuse to finance raw land 
because of the high risk. Because of the financing difficulty, most land sales 
are financed by the property seller. Since your seller refuses to finance the 
sale, perhaps you should be grateful. Maybe this is a signal you shouldn't buy 
that speculative land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Give Up on Impound Overcharge 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a mortgage that requires us to pay one-half of taxes and fire 
insurance each month. The balance in this impound escrow account is now about 
$800 more than will be needed to pay the taxes and insurance in 1990. But the 
lender refuses to adjust our monthly payment or make a refund to us out of this 
account. What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't give up. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Keep complaining to the 
lender and insist on either a refund or a reduction in your monthly payment 
until the impound escrow balance is more reasonable. If necessary, phone the 
lender daily until you get the result you want. Talk only to a supervisor. If 
necessary, insist on talking to the lender's president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Careful of an 'As Is' Home Purchase 
</P>
<P>
Q: I don't have much money for a down payment on a home, so I can't be too 
fussy. However, I found a run-down home in a very desirable neighborhood. The 
problem is it is being offered for sale "as is" by an estate. Are there any 
pitfalls to an "as is" property purchase? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. An "as is" sale means the seller will not pay for any repairs and does 
not make any warranties or representations about the property's condition. In 
other words, be very careful. Make your purchase offer contingent upon your 
approval of a professional property inspection, so you know the defects of the 
property if you decide to go ahead with the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protect Your Heir With a Living Trust 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am in poor health. My son manages several apartment buildings for me. When 
I die, they will go to him. Would it simplify my estate if I have appraisals of 
the properties made now before I die? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. After you die, your estate will have appraisals made of the properties 
because your heir will receive a new basis stepped-up to market value as of the 
date of your death. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to save your son the costs and delays of probate, you can do him a 
big service by placing your properties into a living (intervivos) trust before 
you die. You are the initial trustee and beneficiary, so you can deal with the 
properties as you now do. But upon your death or disability, your alternate 
trustee (presumably your son) takes over managing the assets. 
</P>
<P>
When you die, your properties in the living trust will go to the new 
beneficiary without having to go through probate. Ask your attorney to explain 
the benefits of living trusts further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Property Sale Has Mixed Tax Result 
</P>
<P>
Q: We live in one apartment of a four-apartment building that we own. The owner 
of the adjoining building made us a purchase offer that is too good to resist. 
However, we are worried about the tax we would have to pay. As we are well over 
55, I understand we can use the $125,000 tax exemption, but our profit will be 
around $200,000. Is there any way to get out of paying tax on our profit over 
$125,000? 
</P>
<P>
A: Let's back up. The "over-55 rule" $125,000 home sale tax exemption only 
applies to the sale profit on your personal residence (the value of your 
apartment). It does not apply to your sale profit on the three rental 
apartments. The only way to avoid tax from the profitable sale of the rentals 
is to make a tax-deferred exchange. Since you already have a cash buyer, it 
should be relatively easy to make an IRC 1031(a)(3) Starker delayed exchange. 
Please ask your tax adviser to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Renting Is Better Than Buying 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband is moving up very rapidly with his company, and he just received 
another out-of-town job transfer. It was only about 18 months since his last 
promotion. The company will pay our relocation costs and the probable small 
loss on the sale of our home after all the sales costs are paid. Since we are 
uncertain how long it will be before the next promotion, do you think we might 
be better off renting a house rather than buying? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Frequent transferees are wise to rent instead of buying a home. A lease 
with option to purchase would be even smarter because then you can either buy 
if the expected transfer doesn't materialize or sell your purchase option for a 
small profit if you decide not to buy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Loan Interest Is Tax-Deductible 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last year, we bought our home subject to its existing VA mortgage. We paid a 
$45 transfer fee. But the loan is still in the seller's name. However, we hold 
legal title to the house. Can we deduct the mortgage interest? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Since you must make the mortgage payments or lose the house by 
foreclosure, you are entitled to deduct the mortgage interest which you paid. 
In legal talk, you have the "benefits and burdens" of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you were voluntarily making mortgage payments for a friend or 
relative, but had no risk if you didn't make the payments, then you would not 
be entitled to deduct the mortgage interest. An example of non-deductible 
interest would be if you paid your mother's mortgage payments, but were not on 
the title to her home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short Time for Home Offer Acceptance Best 
</P>
<P>
Q: At a Sunday open house we found what we thought was our dream house. The 
listing agent was a little upset because we wanted to offer $8,000 below the 
asking price, but she prepared our purchase offer for us. As we are first-time 
home buyers, now we realize we should have had our own agent. 
</P>
<P>
When our offer was typed up, it specified a 14-day time limit. We thought that 
was normal and didn't question it. A few days later we phoned the agent to 
inquire if our offer had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was sorry, but another buyer offered a few thousand dollars more 
and the seller accepted the other offer. I told her we would have matched that 
offer as we really wanted the house. Last night, I talked to our family 
attorney and he said it was gross negligence for the agent to make our offer 
valid for 14 days. Do you think we should sue the agent who, we now understand, 
worked for the seller rather than for us? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Forget it. I agree with your attorney that the 14-day time limit on your 
purchase offer was far too long. One or two days is customary, unless the 
seller is out of town or difficult to locate. 
</P>
<P>
Your situation is a classic example of why home buyers should be aware of whom 
the agent represents. Many states now require agents to disclose in writing to 
buyers whether they represent the seller only, the buyer only, or both the 
buyer and seller (called a dual agency). 
</P>
<P>
But I suggest you forget the dispute and get on with finding another home to 
buy. Chances are you will find one you like even better.

AMERICA'S HOUSING: BUILDERS FORMING HOMEOWNERS LOBBY GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
CLOUT: GOAL IS TO PROTECT MORTGAGE-INTEREST DEDUCTION, OTHER CONCERNS. BUT SOME 
CRITICS SEE FUTURE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a city rife with special interest groups. There are lobbyists 
representing the peanut industry, Alaskan loggers, smokeless tobacco, 
chocolate, locksmiths, Pizza Hut, the government of Togo, Reebok sneakers, 
Toshiba Corp. and prescription footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Now the National Assn. of Home Builders (NAHB) is trying to organize a new 
voice in Washington -- Homeowners of America -- to represent the nation's 62 
million homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The group is still being formed. But its agenda is likely to include fighting 
any effort to reduce or eliminate the mortgage-interest deduction or the 
deductibility of state and local taxes, advocating a proposal to allow IRA 
withdrawals for first-time home buyers, opposing building and zoning code 
regulations that raise the cost of housing, and championing an array of issues 
that would improve housing affordability. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a lobbying presence here and an education effort, Homeowners of America 
is considering offering members discounts on homeowner insurance and at 
furniture and home improvement retail outlets as well as home warranty 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bannister has worked for NAHB for 11 years. For the five years before that 
he worked for the National Assn. of Realtors (NAR). 
</P>
<P>
"You're in the lobbying business for years, and you realize they have lobbyists 
for everything imaginable, but a major group like homeowners doesn't have a 
voice," said Bannister, a senior vice president at NAHB. "They are the largest 
untapped constituency in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, several of the trade groups associated with the housing industry -- 
insurers, realtors, lenders and builders -- have been kicking the idea around 
for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a laudable goal, but our survey data just didn't give us the idea that 
we should go ahead with it," said Jerry Jaros, senior vice president of NAR. 
"We were afraid there weren't enough nationwide issues out there that could 
activate, energize this constituency." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a coalition of trade organizations representing the lending 
industry did provide seed money to start an organization called the Alliance 
for America's Homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The group was narrowly focused to fight threats to the mortgage-interest 
deduction, but is now considering a broader agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Before its own decision to try to organize homeowners, NAHB polled 25,000 
people nationwide to determine the interest level. The results were 
overwhelmingly encouraging: 88% thought such a homeowners group would be a good 
idea, and 77% responded that they would be willing to join. More than 70% said 
the most important function of such an organization would be to provide 
representation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about their chief concerns as homeowners, a full 90% answered 
"affordability." Two-thirds said they did not think their children would be 
able to buy a home comparable to their own in the future. Another 90% said they 
would fight any effort to reduce or eliminate the mortgage-interest deduction. 
</P>
<P>
NAHB tentatively intends to launch Homeowners of America next January, with the 
publication of its first national magazine, fashioned loosely after the home 
builders own publication. 
</P>
<P>
"The lobby is not organized to the point that we have come up with a menu of 
specific goals and objectives," said Jack Shine, a builder and developer from 
Encino, Calif., and president of the soon-to-be Homeowners of America. 
</P>
<P>
The new organization will have two main functions, he said: to serve as a voice 
for homeowners in Washington and to inform and educate its members. 
</P>
<P>
"Home ownership is the ultimate investment most people make," Shine said. "More 
than anything else, it has an impact on the quality of their lives. Issues like 
the environment, infrastructure, transportation are part and parcel of what 
makes up their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal and state governments have been able to ignore issues like 
transportation and schools, and all the other things that make up a community's 
infrastructure because there is no constituency to remind them." 
</P>
<P>
Its membership goal is roughly 250,000 by the end of its first year. It will 
reach out to homeowners through its network of builders, by encouraging 
builders to present their customers with one-year memberships at the settlement 
table. There are roughly 1 million new homes sold annually. 
</P>
<P>
NAHB also plans on soliciting memberships among the 800,000 participants in the 
builders' home warranty program. After the first year, members would be asked 
to pay a $15 annual dues to keep it up and running. 
</P>
<P>
One way Homeowners of America's leadership will determine its future agenda may 
be by polling readers through a national magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The organization will be run by a board of directors, chosen from 
"distinguished national figures," Bannister said -- past Presidents, 
businessmen, entertainers and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
NAHB is providing the initial $250,000 start-up funding for the new lobby and 
is negotiating with a sponsor for $1.5 million seed money to run the 
organization until it becomes self-sufficient through membership dues. It is 
also being set up with its own staff and offices, separate and independent of 
NAHB. 
</P>
<P>
"But why would homeowners join anything the home builders are interested in?" 
Bannister asked, anticipating criticism. "Our goals are similar. We both want 
the best-quality housing at the lowest price possible at low interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some consumer groups and others are wary and question the propriety of a 
trade organization's attempt to organize consumers: 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of homeowners will view themselves as having interests similar 
to those of the home builders," said Michelle Meier, counsel for government 
affairs with Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
"But in terms of whether or not they will be able to represent the best public 
policy issues, I don't think they will be able to because their major interest 
has to be profit and their own financial viability." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conflict of interest issue, Donald Campbell, staff director of 
the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs, said: "I can't see any 
inherent conflict, but that sort of thing would come up around specific issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It will depend on how the leadership is organized. NAHB could have interests 
different from homeowners. But if the homeowners' organization were not allowed 
to represent its own interests, it would wither on the vine very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
"The first question we were asked when we released some of our studies about 
the importance of the mortgage-interest deduction was 'who paid for this 
stuff,' " said Gary J. Perkinson, director of the Alliance for America's 
Homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to divorce yourself. I am sure the builders are sincere, but they are 
misguided. I just can't believe that when push comes to shove that the builders 
will let an ancillary group have a negative impact on the main group." 
</P>
<P>
The Alliance broke free recently from its initial supporters -- the lenders. 
</P>
<P>
But Jaros of the NAR downplayed possible conflicts. "Any large organization is 
like a family," he said. "Its members will agree most of the time, but not all 
the time. You can still be a member of the family and not agree." 
</P>
<P>
Because the new organization isn't up and running, NAHB is reluctant to discuss 
its possible bids for independence down the road. Other organizations begun by 
NAHB in recent years, such as the Home Owners Warranty Corp. and the Home 
Builders Institute are now completely independent entities today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like raising your child and deciding from day one which college he will 
go to before you know how smart he is or what his interests are," Shine said. 
"I can say that from day one, Homeowners of America's income will be used to 
staff it independently from NAHB."

FANNIE MAE TIGHTENS 'LOW DOC' MORTGAGE RULES; 
</P>
<P>
BORROWING: NEW REGULATIONS MAKE IT EASIER TO CRACK DOWN ON PERSONS 
MISREPRESENTING THEIR CREDIT WORTHINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many lenders have put tough new restrictions on "low-documentation" loans, 
those popular mortgages that allow borrowers to finance their purchases without 
having to fill out all the paper work that's involved in getting a standard 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, low-documentation mortgages -- often called "low-doc" or "no 
doc" loans -- were extremely popular with repeat buyers who had built up lots 
of equity in their previous home. 
</P>
<P>
By making a large down payment on their new house -- usually at least 25% or 
more -- these borrowers were able to eliminate most of the paper work involved 
in getting a loan and also were able to get their money within a matter of 
weeks or even days. 
</P>
<P>
The low-doc loans have also been popular with self-employed people, such as 
doctors and small merchants. By making a big down payment, these borrowers were 
able to avoid having to produce past tax returns and other documents that might 
not show all of their income or jive with what they told their loan officer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some changes made by the Federal National Mortgage Assn. have made the 
loans tougher to get and also makes it easier to crack down on borrowers who 
misrepresent their credit worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
Under the stringent new guidelines, borrowers using Fannie Mae's most popular 
low-doc program must sign a certificate stating that they haven't lied about 
their earnings, assets, employment, debts or the source of their down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Importantly, the certificate also gives lenders the power to verify that 
everything the borrower puts on the application is true -- and points out that 
deliberate falsification is a federal crime "punishable by fine or imprisonment 
or both." 
</P>
<P>
"With these new rules, you'd be a fool if you lied on your loan application," 
said Paddy Dooley, executive vice president of Brentwood-based mortgage banker 
Camden Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae's new guidelines are important because they're automatically adopted 
by thousands of independent financial institutions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the new rules technically apply only to loans for $187,450 or less, 
some lenders who make low-doc loans for more than that amount are also applying 
the stricter standards. 
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae's chief competitor -- the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 
nicknamed "Freddie Mac" -- also has put some of it own, less-comprehensive 
guidelines into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Although no industrywide statistics are available, it has been estimated that 
low-documentation loans accounted for more than 30% of all mortgage-making 
activity last year. 
</P>
<P>
That figure may be even higher in California and other parts of the West, where 
many of today's repeat buyers can afford to make big down payments because they 
made so much money from the sale of their previous home. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley at Camden Financial estimates that as many as 60% of the over-$187,450 
loans her institution has made over the past few years have been low-doc or 
no-doc loans. 
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae instituted the changes after its own investigators checked out some 
of the low-doc loans that have been made by independent lenders over the past 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Some loans were made to borrowers who had declared bankruptcy just a few years 
earlier. Other borrowers got their down payment from accounts that had a long 
history of bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
Still others simply lied about their earnings and assets on their original loan 
application. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation "helped us find out two things," said Robert J. Engelstad, a 
Fannie Mae senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"First, we found that some lenders weren't being as careful as they should be 
when it came to checking out their borrowers. And second, we saw that there was 
some borrower misrepresentation going on." 
</P>
<P>
To minimize its risks, Engelstad said, Fannie Mae will require borrowers under 
its most popular low-doc program to make a minimum down payment of 30%. If part 
of that 30% down payment is a gift, the borrower will be ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to go for a low-doc loan, be prepared to show where your down 
payment is coming from," said Mary Jane Arthur, a senior vice president with 
GMAC Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"Bank statements for three consecutive months will probably do the job, or so 
would a 'closing statement' that shows your profits from the sale of your 
previous home." 
</P>
<P>
Although the new restrictions are making it a bit tougher for borrowers to get 
low-doc loans, Dooley at Camden Financial says they're good for both lenders 
and borrowers alike. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do anybody any good to get a loan that they won't be able to 
repay," she said.

HOW MONTHLY PAYMENT IS AMORTIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell, a retired Times staff writer, now is a 
Phoenix-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: How do the loan or mortgage people determine how much is to go to 
principal and how much to your interest? When I get my statement for the year, 
almost all of the payment has gone to interest. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The principle behind the amortized mortgage is simple. Over the 20- or 
30-year life span of the mortgage, the amount going to principal each month 
goes up slowly and the amount going to interest goes down so that at the end of 
20 or 30 years, the debt is paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Amortization came in after the Depression in the '30s because until then, most 
home financing was pretty rudimentary. Normally, after making a down payment, 
you paid an interest-only loan for about five years and then refinanced for 
another five years and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, in all too many cases, it meant that 10, 15 or 20 years down the 
road, the homeowner had virtually no equity in his home and was facing one big 
balloon payment he couldn't make. Foreclosures swept the country. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, amortization gives the homeowner a chance to establish some equity, 
no matter how tiny, right from the first payment. 
</P>
<P>
But the arrangement is skewed in the lender's favor, with the lion's share of 
the monthly payment going to the lender's interest and a fraction of it going 
to the reduction of principal. 
</P>
<P>
On the typical 30-year loan, you're well into the 25th or 26th year before half 
of your payment is going to the reduction of principal. Basically, even for 
someone like me who moves his lips when he counts, the mathematical principle 
of the amortized loan isn't all that complicated. 
</P>
<P>
But the trouble with it is that the computation has to be done every month. A 
30-year mortgage is a 360-payment note the first month. The second month it has 
to be recomputed as a 359-payment instrument, and so on. Fortunately, the 
computer came along to save the lenders from a lot of eye strain. 
</P>
<P>
Let's take a brief example of how the interest rate affects the amount of the 
payment going to principal. 
</P>
<P>
With a $60,000-, 30-year mortgage at 10%, $26.54 of the first month's payment 
of $526.54 is going to principal (equity buildup). At 10.5%, the monthly 
payment goes to $548.84, but the amount going to principal ($23.84) shrinks 
quite a bit. At 11%, the payment goes to $571.39 a month, but the principal 
payment drops to $21.39 and, at 11.5%, with a $594.17 payment, a negligible 
$19.17 a month is going to equity buildup. Discouraging, isn't it? 
</P>

What to Do When a Mortgage Is Paid Up 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you please send me any information you have on what to do when you 
come to the end of your mortgage payments? I need to know what documents to 
expect from the mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
A: What do you do when you finish making your last mortgage payment? You crack 
open a bottle of champagne, of course. 
</P>
<P>
You raise a good point, though, because in far too many cases the homeowner, 
once he receives the reconveyance deed from the mortgage holder, will simply 
put it in his safe deposit box and forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
State laws vary, and instead of getting a reconveyance deed you may simply get 
the original of the debt document with the date, the signature of someone 
representing the mortgage holder and a notary's seal and signature. Or, it may 
be a "Release of Mortgage" form or a simple "notice of payment in full." But 
most states require that the document be sent to you in some stated time -- a 
month or six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is up to you to see that the document is recorded with the county 
clerk. Otherwise, snug in your safe deposit box, or not, it's going to show up 
as a lien on your property.

CULTIVATING MINIATURE GARDEN ON A WINDOWSILL; 
</P>
<P>
FLOWERS: WINDOW BOXES PROVIDE SMALL SPACES IN WHICH TO NURTURE A VARIETY OF 
COLORFUL PLANTS.

<P>
Window boxes have several advantages over gardens: They bring nature up close 
at eye level, they provide a compact place to nurture plants for individuals 
without much space and they brighten buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Although on a smaller scale, window boxes today are planted for the same 
reasons as those in ancient times. In Egypt, Queen Hatshepsut decreed that 
stone vessels be filled with plants to ornament terraces and balustrades, and 
Queen Semiramis had terraces constructed in which flowering plants and trees 
were grown in containers. 
</P>
<P>
The same desire to showcase ornamental plants at eye level, where they can be 
enjoyed, underlies the creation of miniature landscapes on windowsills today. 
In other countries, notably England and Switzerland, window boxes are quite 
common, both for residences and for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Suitable materials for flower boxes are pine, redwood, cedar, concrete, plastic 
and metal. Pine is cheap though not very durable; cedar is more expensive and 
more moisture resistant. But redwood is best because of its resistance to rot. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete boxes sound uninviting, but they are quite good so long as they have 
adequate drainage. Plastic and metal boxes tend to overheat in the sun; they 
can, however, be employed as liners within concrete or wooden boxes. 
</P>
<P>
In filling a window box, don't be tempted to dash out into the back yard and 
dig up the needed dirt. Generally, such soil compacts quickly, is low in 
nutrients, may contain soil diseases, drains poorly -- many reasons for 
avoiding its use in a concentrated growing area. Commercial potting soils are 
better. 
</P>
<P>
The soil should be rich in nutrients because of intense competition of roots in 
a restricted growing area. Before planting, work in organic or granulated 
chemical fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
Drainage is extremely important. The bottom of the window box should have a 
number of holes. If a box rests directly on a windowsill or balcony, the 
drainage holes may be ineffective. Attach thin strips of wood to the underside 
of the box to elevate it. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Southern California, window boxes can be colorful the year round and 
quite creative. The number and variety of plants available is considerable, and 
your local nursery will stock many possibilities. The window boxes I remember 
from my childhood in the Midwest always contained red geraniums (or 
salmon-colored geraniums for iconoclasts), white petunias and trailing 
variegated vinca. 
</P>
<P>
But here in the Southland, the range of plants is overwhelming, and gardeners 
have few preconceptions about material. Some recommended choices, most of which 
I've grown in containers or window boxes, are shown in the accompanying chart, 
which shows flowers for planting in summer, fall, winter and spring. 
</P>
<P>
The window box outside our bedroom window has contained many combinations over 
the years. At first, the area was quite sunny, and I planted it with yellow 
marigolds, golden fleece (Dahlberg) daisies, blue salvia and parsley. When the 
area became a little shadier, I used tall coleus, trailing coleus, and the 
fuchsia 'Display.' Another year it held tuberous begonias and maidenhair ferns. 
In the winter, it contains cyclamen and in the spring, cineraria or primroses. 
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to create an immediate, continual show of color, use a technique 
that nurseries, hotels and businesses follow. In their window and planter 
boxes, gallon containers of blooming plants are sunk. 
</P>
<P>
Then spaghnum moss is arranged around the surface to conceal the tops of the 
pots. This method provides instant color -- at a price, of course. Commercial 
establishments remove the pots when the blooms are spent and replace the entire 
display. 
</P>
<P>
To produce the maximum bloom from window box plants, feed twice a month with a 
diluted solution of plant fertilizer. Because boxes dry out quickly in hot 
weather, be prepared to water once or twice a day. Drip irrigation systems can 
be most helpful to reduce watering chores. 
</P>
<P>
Remove dead blossoms to prolong the bloom period. If aphids or other insects 
attack, spray with an insecticide or insecticidal soap. Actually, plants in 
boxes are less vulnerable to insect attacks since they are off the ground.

AVOID LARGE BILL: REDO SHOWER PAN YOURSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and a free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most common repair problems in homes more than 15 years old is 
leakage from a stall shower that results from cracks between the tiles or 
defects in the waterproof material built up under the base tiles of the shower, 
commonly called the "shower pan." 
</P>
<P>
Most homeowners find themselves facing a repair bill for replacing the shower 
pan of at least $750, and often much more if wall tiles need replacement as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
If you have been told that you need a shower pan or suspect you have a leak, 
you may be able to fix it yourself in less than an hour, even if you are all 
thumbs. Follow these simple steps: 
</P>
<P>
Start by cleaning the shower with a scouring pad so that it is absolutely 
spotless. Any soap residue or mildew stains must be removed completely. Let it 
dry thoroughly for 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
From any paint or hardware store, buy a cartridge of clear silicone sealant. 
Use G.E. Silicone II (which is almost odorless), Red Devil, Elmers, Dap or Dow 
Corning. Also, buy a caulking gun for about $2. 
</P>
<P>
Read and follow the basic safety instructions on the product, then insert the 
cartridge into the gun and cut the tip of the cartridge nozzle about 
three-eighth of an inch from the point. Insert a long nail into the hole to 
puncture the inner seal. 
</P>
<P>
Place the tip of the cartridge where the floor and wall tiles join at a grout 
line. Gently squeeze the activator of the gun to force the silicone sealant 
from the tip at a steady rate while moving the gun slowly across the grout 
joint. 
</P>
<P>
Continue applying a line of silicone about one-quarter-inch wide around the 
entire base of the shower. Smooth the material into the grout with your index 
finger, making sure there are no uneven or rough spots and that the grout is 
completely covered. Wipe the material off your finger with a rag. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat this procedure at every other grout joint in the shower where tile 
surfaces join at an angle. Also, seal around the plumbing fixtures, soap holder 
and at the tile-enclosure joint. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the key to successfully sealing the shower against leakage. Across 
every grout line between the tiles themselves on the base of the shower and up 
the walls about 30 inches, apply a thin coat of silicone sealant. Again, smooth 
the material with a finger so that coverage is complete, and that's it! 
</P>
<P>
Let the shower dry overnight before using it. Monitor the success of your work 
by carefully observing plaster damage on walls near the shower for dampness or 
further deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a point of reference on the damaged plaster is helpful. Draw a pencil 
line around the damaged area so you can tell if any new problems develop 
outside the original line. Continue checking the plaster for three to four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If water damage or moisture has been found under the house below the shower, 
have the sub-area reinspected after one month of regular use of the shower. 
</P>
<P>
If no further wall damage is seen, and if the sub-area of the house below the 
shower is dry, you can presume that your efforts have paid off. If, however, 
some moisture is still present or damage to the walls is continuing, don't give 
up yet. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that tile is leaking at a point higher on the wall than 30 
inches, and you should seal the remaining wall tiles up to 60 inches around the 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
When this process is successful, as it is most of the time, it saves a big 
expense and major inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, though, that because of normal wear and shifting and settling of all 
wood frame structures, new cracks may appear in the tile or grout and the 
silicone may have to be touched up. As a rule, it should be inspected every 
other month. 
</P>
<P>
Prolong the life of the silicone sealant, though, by using only mild, 
abrasive-free cleaning products in the shower. 
</P>

WHY CERAMIC-TILE FLOOR CRACKS IN BATHROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY, The Careys are syndicated columnists and 
general contractors in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Why is my newly installed ceramic-tile floor cracking in one of the 
two bathrooms I just refloored and not in the other? My home has a wood floor 
system, and the tile I did in the other bathroom has held up beautifully with 
no damage at all. I had stripped off the old linoleum floor coverings, 
installed mortarboard atop the subfloors in both bathrooms, and used the same 
tile, tile adhesive and grout in each instance. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Actually, your mistake was quite simple. You assumed mortarboard was 
the same as the real thing, and a check as to the condition of the wood floor 
was not made: You failed to ensure that the floor framing members (the skeleton 
like series of wood members that support the flooring) were strong enough to 
resist deflection (sagging or bending) when walked on, and that the same 
problem did not exist at the subfloor itself. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike carpet, wood and linoleum floor coverings, ceramic tile is quite 
brittle. Hence, when the tile-covered wood floor deflects (moves), the brittle 
tiles crack. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminate localized floor movement. The most common method is to apply a layer 
of mortar (mixture of cement and sand -- sort of like concrete without the 
rocks) between the subfloor and the tile. Steel reinforcing bars embedded in 
the mortar lend to its overall rigidity. 
</P>
<P>
Mortarboard may provide the smooth surface needed to accomplish a professional 
looking tile job, but it will not necessarily eliminate movement. In tract 
homes it is very common to see ceramic tile laid directly onto "beefed-up" wood 
floors, but in finer custom homes the subfloor is dropped 2 inches or more in 
areas where ceramic tile will be placed to allow for a thick (strong) mortar 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiberglass Preferred for New Shower Pan 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are remodeling our bathroom and will need a new shower pan. Our 
contractor has suggested fiberglass or terrazzo. Can you tell me what the 
difference is between the two? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Both are very popular. Although they have been around for a long time, 
modern production techniques have greatly improved their overall quality. 
</P>
<P>
The fiberglass shower receptors are generally one-piece molded products with a 
nonskid surface. They are very sturdy, easy to clean and and resistant to 
fading, staining, fungus and abrasion. You will find these most commonly 
available in white or off-white. 
</P>
<P>
The terrazzo shower receptor is a little more decorative. It is constructed of 
tan-and-white marble chips cast in Portland cement. The surface is ground and 
polished, then grouted and polished again. It too is a very durable product and 
requires very little maintenance. Although terrazzo is somewhat more expensive, 
it will not necessarily last longer than fiberglass. Exclusive of your personal 
taste for appearances, we would recommend the fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removing Unsightly Non-Skid Appliques 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have some of those decorative non-skid appliques on my bathtub that have 
become quite unsightly. How may I go about removing them? 
</P>
<P>
A: These adhesive-bound appliques, which come in a variety of colors, shapes 
and sizes are designed for bathtubs that aren't manufactured with an integral 
non-skid surface. They serve a very important purpose, especially since studies 
have shown that the majority of home accidents occur in or around bathtubs. 
However, after some time they do tend to deteriorate and need to be removed and 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
If your tub has a porcelain finish the most effective method of removal is with 
the use of a sharp razor blade. Any adhesive residue that may remain can be 
removed with a mild detergent and warm water. 
</P>
<P>
Fiberglass or acrylic tubs pose a more difficult problem, because their finish 
may be more easily damaged if great care is not employed. Razor blades are a 
no-no here. Manufacturers of these synthetic products recommend using acetone 
and a clean soft cloth. Make sure that there is adequate ventilation when 
working around acetone vapors. They can be hazardous to your health. 
</P>
<P>
Should your attempt to remove the appliques fail, there are firms that 
specialize in tub refinishing. Some are even equipped to install a new clear 
nonskid surface over the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removing Water Stains From Wood Ceiling 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do I get the black water stains off our tongue-and-groove wood ceilings 
after roof leaks? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, needless to say the first step is to repair the roof leak and permit 
the wood ceiling to completely dry. Then a trip to your paint supply company 
for some wood bleach is in order. 
</P>
<P>
This product is generally applied in two parts. The first solution is applied 
directly to the stained area and left to stand for about five minutes, then, 
while the surface is still wet, the second solution is applied. 
</P>
<P>
Use a nylon brush or rubber sponge to apply the wood bleach. Separate 
applicators should be used for each solution. After both solutions have been 
removed and the area has been permitted to dry, lightly sand it to remove any 
residue that may remain. Most important, remember to follow the manufacturer's 
specifications and always wear rubber gloves and proper eye protection.

SINK NOW HIGH-TECH WATERWORKS; 
</P>
<P>
REMODEL: ELEGANT, EUROPEAN-STYLE FAUCETS OUTDO THE OLD-FASHIONED TWIST-VALVE 
TYPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The kitchen sink has progressed from being mere plumbing to becoming a 
high-tech water processor. 
</P>
<P>
The faucet has come a long way, according to an article in the current issue of 
Esquire, since the days when it had two star-shaped twist valves containing 
small washers. The washers regularly started to leak and had to be replaced 
about once a year. 
</P>
<P>
These gave way to single-lever mixer valves, the automatic transmission of 
plumbing that mixes hot and cold water and regulates volume by the swing of the 
lever. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with most of the lever faucets is the crudeness of their touch. One 
careless tug can send a burst of water spraying everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The handles -- chrome wings or flippers -- tend to look like bad airport 
sculpture of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The latest kitchen faucets have come a long way. The top designs for providing 
water are European, and they are becoming as popular as imported European 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The leading edge in faucets belongs to the firms of rival German cousins. 
Friedrich Grohe's company, Grohe America, has been on the U.S. scene since 
1976. Klaus Grohe's firm, Hansgrohe, only a fifth as large, is just now 
arriving on these shores. 
</P>
<P>
Their rivalry has produced excellence in the best capitalist tradition. 
</P>
<P>
First, Grohe America introduced faucets of elegant arc and simple controls that 
also feature pull-out spray heads, combining the spray guns you used to find on 
the side of the sink with the faucet itself. This turned the combination into a 
high-tech, high-power, high-precision instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hansgrohe has topped its rival with the Allegroh and Uno models, also with 
spray heads, which are close to the ultimate kitchen faucet. One touch of the 
faucets, now being introduced in the United States, is like steering a fine 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The top-of-the-line metal Allegroh comes in chrome, "satin" chrome, brown or 
white. The almost identical Uno is rendered in hard plastic in red, brown, 
white-gray and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
The Allegroh and Uno were given shape by Frogdesign, the firm behind Sony 
Trinitron TVs and Apple Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
The turret-shaped top looks strangely animate. Its "eyes" are two dots of 
color, red for hot and blue for cold. The control piece or lever head is a 
U-shaped yoke or jaw. You can work it with your pinky while your hands are full 
of guacamole. 
</P>
<P>
The spout swings a wide 160 degrees and has at its end the glove-like mouth of 
the sprayer. Pull the sprayer out and you have a power tool for the sink. 
</P>
<P>
The spray gun's steady controls give you the feel of operating, in its 
needle-jet mode, some sort of fine electric woodworking device, or in the 
aerated soft-spray mode, an airbrush in the hands of a master illustrator.

INSTALLMENT SALES BENEFIT BUYERS AND SELLERS; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: ADVANTAGES ARE AVAILABLE TO BOTH PARTIES WHEN THE SELLER HELPS TO 
FINANCE THE TRANSACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smart real estate buyers and sellers understand the tax benefits of deferred 
payment sales, also known as installment sales. The major advantages for 
property sellers include a quick easy sale for top dollar, interest income 
higher than can be earned with safety elsewhere, and profit tax deferral until 
the buyer makes principal payments to the seller. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages for realty buyers include easy financing, no red tape obtaining a 
new mortgage and an affordable, often below-market interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Jan. 1, 1988, Congress changed the installment sale rules applicable 
to realty sales up to $5 million. When the seller helps finance the sale, such 
as by carrying back a first or second mortgage for the buyer, the seller pays 
tax on the sale profit as principal payments are received over future years 
from the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
A minimum interest rate, usually at least 9%, must be charged on the unpaid 
balance. Interest, of course, is fully taxable income in the tax year received. 
</P>
<P>
The installment sale election is automatic. However, a deferred payment seller 
can "unelect" and report the entire sale profit in the year of sale. If the 
seller has offsetting losses, reporting all the sale profit in one year can be 
advantageous. However, such an election cannot be revoked without IRS 
approval.After the sale, if the property seller pledges or sells the 
installment sale note, such as borrowing against it at a bank, the loan 
proceeds become taxable as a payment received on the installment sale 
obligation. This hypothecation rule applies to installment loans created after 
Dec. 17, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When an installment sale of real estate is made to a related party, defined as 
spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister, controlled corporation 
and related partnership or family trust, if the buyer disposes of the property 
within two years, the sale profit will be taxed back to the original 
installment sale seller. 
</P>
<P>
This rule prevents shifting profits to taxpayers who may be in more favorable 
income tax situations. However, installment sales incident to divorce or legal 
separation are not subject to this provision. 
</P>
<P>
In special situations where the ultimate price of the property is contingent on 
a future event, such as a land seller sharing in subdivision resale profits, 
the seller can use an installment sale even though total profit is indefinite. 
This arrangement allows the buyer to conserve down payment cash while 
developing the property and enhancing its future value. 
</P>
<P>
Installment sales also are allowed even when the buyer wants to make full 
payment for the property, but the seller wants to avoid receipt of all the 
sales price in one tax year. An escrow agreement can authorize installment sale 
proceeds to be held in an escrow trust beyond the property seller's control. 
The advantage for the seller is tax deferral, even though the buyer gets full 
use of the property without a mortgage encumbrance to the seller. For further 
installment sale details, please consult your tax adviser.

SUMMER VACATIONS ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
JERRY HULSE'S PERSONAL BESTS; 
</P>
<P>
FAVORITE MEMORIES OF PLACES THAT STIR THE WANDERLUST OF A SEASONED TRAVELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE, TIMES TRAVEL EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With summer approaching, I have been reflecting on places I have a particular 
fondness for. One tempts fate, of course, when one meddles with the past -- 
resurrecting the imagery of spent moments, reflecting on joys that surfaced 
spontaneously, only to pass as some rare and remembered dawn. Still, while such 
moments cannot be replayed, the destinations call to the heart to return. 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation I would sail again to Washington state's San Juan Islands, 
especially Orcas, whose weathered farmhouses and barns evoke memories of 
coastal Maine. 
</P>
<P>
One arrives by ferry from Anacortes, slipping by fishing trawlers and small 
islands with summer homes and beaches choked with driftwood. Gulls wheel 
overhead, and when the fog rolls in, a haunting stillness envelops this world 
of wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
On Orcas, wildflowers blanket the roadside and cattle and sheep graze in wet 
green meadows beside farmhouses whose windows glow cheerily at dusk. Orcas 
offers tranquillity; even the village of Eastsound is caught up in a time warp 
that reflects a period when life in America was less hurried. Wooden buildings 
line the main street and seafood fresh from the channel is served in several 
good restaurants, particularly Christina's, whose windows frame the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Miles of country lanes cross the island, taking in shady glens and deserted 
coves, as well as Moran State Park, where vacationers picnic in the shadow of 
Mt. Constitution. Shelter is provided at nearly two dozen inns and hotels, 
including Orcas Hotel ("Your Doorway to the Island's Victorian Past"), which 
rises on a bluff overlooking the ferry landing. The hotel is a three-story 
saltbox with a dozen guest rooms, a dining room with a fireplace and a lounge 
with a harbor view. 
</P>
<P>
Given the opportunity, I would return to Orcas, where sea otters pass and 
sandpipers scatter along the shore and the air is a refreshing mixture of salt 
and pine and the fragrance of roses. 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, I might settle again at Morrison's Lodge, which is on the Rogue 
River near Grants Pass and the village of Merlin. In summer, vacationers raft 
the rapids and pick berries, and in autumn they fish for salmon and steelhead 
and study the changing colors of maples that frame the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison's features shelter in an unspoiled wilderness beside the Rogue, where 
bears fish for salmon and bald eagles soar, while deer and Roosevelt elk graze 
within earshot of the lodge. At Morrison's, vacationers from the city become 
dropouts in a world that remains as peaceful as a scudding cloud. 
</P>
<P>
A chance to turn back the calendar? I would hasten to Hawaii and settle at Hana 
on the east side of Maui, or perhaps the Waipio Valley on Hawaii's Big Island. 
</P>
<P>
As old island hands know, getting to Hana requires patience, what with more 
than 400 curves and 56 bridges, some so narrow that only one car can squeeze by 
at a time. Alongside the road the jungle is choked with shower trees and vines 
as delicate as a spider's web. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfalls spill into pools with moss-covered banks and bouquets of plumeria 
and torch ginger. One moment the road rises hundreds of feet above the ocean 
and the next instant it sweeps past lonely, uninhabited beaches. 
</P>
<P>
A sign reads: "Don't hurry, don't worry -- and don't forget to smell the 
flowers." This is old Hawaii, the Hawaii that existed before mass tourism and 
the advent of the high-rise. Tin-roof shanties face the ocean and rainbows bend 
across Hawaii's incredibly blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
While it is a pity to miss the drive, vacationers in a hurry fly from Kahului 
to Hana by helicopter or in small, twin-engine airplanes. As for Hana Town, 
well, just don't blink: a bank, a postage stamp-size post office, a few 
churches, a gas station and a couple of general stores, including Hasegawa's, 
which continues to stock every imaginable item from kerosene lamps and chick 
meal to passion fruit and poi. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter is provided at a handful of inns and hotels, including the splendid, 
low-rise Hotel Hana-Maui with its impeccable good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Close by there's the solitude of Hamoa Beach and pastures where cattle graze. 
Locals refer to their village as Heavenly Hana, and for good reason. One day I 
hitched a ride with a helicopter pilot and we hovered nose-to-nose with a 
waterfall hundreds of feet over the beach -- while over the headset came the 
strains of "Chariots of Fire." Wow! 
</P>
<P>
At the haunting Waipio Valley on the Big Island, those who elect to remain 
overnight have but one choice: Tom Araki's Waipio Hotel, a five-room clapboard 
inn with only a single shower and mattresses that sag like hammocks strung 
between palms. Still, the peacefulness of Waipio makes up for Araki's lack of 
amenities. One reads by kerosene lamp and cooks on a Coleman stove, and it's 
impossible to be disturbed by telephones -- because none exist. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, little has changed in Waipio Valley. I recall awakening to 
the pounding of waves and the distant thunder of a waterfall; later I explored 
the jungle and picked papayas and mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
During the night it had rained, and so streams poured forth from the mountains, 
threading their way to a magnificent black-sand beach, where the Waipio Valley 
meets the ocean. I've promised myself I'm going back someday -- and I might 
just remain. 
</P>
<P>
I have other memories of Western Samoa and Aggie Grey's, a hotel of great 
warmth in the village of Apia. And although Aggie has gone to her reward and 
Samoa, perhaps, will never be quite the same, one is relatively certain that 
the character of Aggie's hotel will survive. James Michener was fond of Aggie. 
Indeed, there are those who insist she was Bloody Mary in Michener's monumental 
"South Pacific," although he denies this, as did Aggie. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I visited Aggie she was fretting about growing old, although in 
the minds of the hundreds of Marines she fed hamburgers to during World War II, 
Aggie will remain forever young. It wasn't until the fighting was over and the 
Marines had gone home that Aggie opened her hotel. I recall when chickens ran 
through the rooms and geckos darted across the ceiling -- while rain pounded 
furiously on Aggie's tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene. 
</P>
<P>
So is Apia, the village where islanders continue to trade -- a setting that 
stirs memories of pictures on an old South Seas wall calendar: Samoans gather 
on storefront verandas and pigs run in the street, and tourists hail beat-up 
taxis to deliver them to jungle rivers where dugout canoes are hired for a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Samoa, trade winds blow through open thatched-roof fales, youngsters 
run naked on the beaches and on a distant hilltop a monument marks the final 
resting place of Robert Louis Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
As an old island buff I couldn't resist Hydra, which is reached by hydrofoil 
from Athens' port of Piraeus. Fishing boats face the harbor and facing the 
boats is a string of galleries, boutiques, bars and cafes. Overhead, perched on 
the hillside, whitewashed houses and chapels are put to canvas by artists who 
struggle up steep steps leading to their doors. 
</P>
<P>
For years there wasn't a single car on the entire island. Either one walked or 
rode a donkey. Even now there are only a handful of taxis. And only a couple of 
major streets. And so if one wishes to visit the fishing hamlets of Kaminia or 
Vlichos, one must go by boat, or else travel by donkey. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of peace draws visitors to Hydra, where a sign at the waterfront reads: 
"Welcome to the Island of Joy." In little tavernas, visitors sip retsina while 
candles flicker in old wine jugs and the melodies of mandolins pour into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Memories. Well, Tangier, the North African city that entertains visitors doing 
one-night stands from Spain, continues to fascinate me. Earlier, the old 
Moroccan city served as an international zone under the control of eight 
nations, including the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
One hotelier recalls how Tangier was an "exciting, tight-knit little community" 
from which there was little chance to escape in the event of a crime. Police 
patrolled the harbor. Others patrolled the roads and the airport. Tangier was 
locked tight as a safe-deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
The hotelier sighed: "You could walk down the street carrying an armload of 
cash. No one would molest you. Who would be so foolish? Who would be so crazy?" 
He smiled. "With all the police there was no escape." 
</P>
<P>
Tangier was like a scene out of "Casablanca." One half expects to run into 
Claude Rains. Or Bogie himself. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II Tangier was a gathering place for spies from a dozen 
nations. By day they spied on one another and by night they repaired to the bar 
at Hotel El Minzah. "After all," said one hotelier, "even spies need a few 
moments of relaxation." 
</P>
<P>
With the war over, the spies abandoned Tangier and the tourists took over, 
moving into El Minzah with its marble floors and flowered courtyard. In 
Tangier, Hotel El Minzah remains a legend, rising like a pasha's palace on a 
hillside overlooking the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In its gardens, exotic women reposed around a swimming pool while Moroccans 
gathered for cocktails. I recall a bartender named Mohammed, a striking figure 
in a red fez whose gold tooth flashed like sunlight itself whenever he smiled. 
Patrons agreed that Mohammed mixed the best martini in all North Africa. I'm 
going back, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
Rising blindingly white above the Strait of Gibraltar, Tangier is reached by 
ferry from Algeciras, Gibraltar and Malaga. One may fly, but the ferry provides 
a stunning approach to the port city. Tourists climb narrow, winding streets to 
the casbah where shopkeepers shout their sales pitches. If there is a town in 
all North Africa where the tourist is king, it is Tangier. 
</P>
<P>
Other moments I'm tempted to return to England, to the little village of 
Chagford with its celebrated inn, the Gidleigh Park, a Tudor-style mansion set 
in 40 acres of gardens and forest on the edge of Dartmoor National Park, about 
200 miles southwest of London in the lovely Devon countryside. 
</P>
<P>
A fire crackles in the lounge and oak paneling glows throughout the rambling 
old mansion, which is within earshot of the River Teign and surrounded by 
wildflowers, copper beech, maples and sweet chestnut. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans continue to sing their praises of the inn, as do Americans. Indeed, 
Gidleigh Park is operated by an American couple, Paul Henderson, a New 
Englander, and his wife, Kay, a displaced Hoosier. Guests fish for salmon and 
trout or else hike the haunting moor. Others choose the privacy of the woods, 
with picnic baskets that await their arrival -- along with bottles of wine that 
are found chilling in the icy river. 
</P>
<P>
And, well, there's Paris. The memories burn deeply. I recall an old woman with 
a pushcart filled with violets who waited patiently for couples exiting a 
bistro to sell her flowers to. Later she disappeared down a cobbled alley -- 
just as a new day began. 
</P>
<P>
Along Boulevard St. Germain that morning the trees were starting to leaf out, 
and although it was barely 7 a.m. a crowd already had gathered at Cafe les Deux 
Magots, which was where Hemingway scribbled away the hours, turning out his 
marvelous prose. 
</P>
<P>
Always in Paris I sense the old excitement as I catch sight of Notre Dame . . . 
or cross Place de la Concorde on a rainy afternoon . . . or stroll along the 
Seine . . . or take a table at a sidewalk cafe along Boulevard St. Germain, 
studying Parisians hurrying on their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago I discovered a little Left Bank bistro, La Polka des Mandibules, 
whose spirited owner, Monique Claude, made no secret that La Polka des 
Mandibules was dedicated to romance. 
</P>
<P>
She served heart-shaped sandwiches and patrons listened intently while a 
stunning blonde sang haunting love songs. In this dimly-lit cave a single 
candle burned at each table and wine spigots rose from the copper table tops, 
so that everyone poured for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
La Polka des Mandibules possessed a magic that is hard to define. Years later I 
returned, but it was closed and Claude had disappeared. Well, never mind. Paris 
survives. There are other haunts. La Coupole in Montparnasse, which is favored 
by a creative crowd, is a fine place to linger over a cup of espresso. Others 
gather at L'Auberge des Deux Signes on Rue Galande, which is where waiters pass 
out music menus to guests who order recorded classics played with their meal. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Annecy, which is said to be the prettiest village in all France. 
Although it is barely a year since my last visit, the desire to return 
persists, this wish to stroll once more beside little canals as artists sketch 
Quai du l'Isle and Rue Perriere and bridges that span the canals. It is indeed 
a moment in time that plays to the hearts of all who visit this picture-perfect 
village near Grenoble in southeastern France. 
</P>
<P>
I carry on a love affair with Austria as well. Readers will recall Schloss 
Durnstein, the 15th-Century castle-hotel on the Danube where classical melodies 
are piped to the dining room and logs burn on chilly nights and other warmth is 
reflected by a ceramic stove. 
</P>
<P>
With its vaulted ceilings, baroque armoires and other treasures, Schloss 
Durnstein is unlike any other hotel between Vienna and Salzburg, as is the 
village of Durnstein with its narrow, cobbled streets and vine-covered hills 
and an ancient church whose bell strikes the hour like the echo of thunder on a 
rainy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Danube, visitors gather to capture scenes that bless the village: a 
hilltop castle, barges passing downriver, cattle grazing by the roadside and 
baroque steeples rising on the horizon. Should I return, I would indeed take a 
table on the terrace at Schloss Durnstein . . . to feed both body and soul. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, of course, remains close to the heart. Only recently I returned to 
Murren, the little Alpine village in the Bernese Oberland -- where cares are 
abandoned and cars are banned. But while Murren is a joy, a few miles away the 
melody of cowbells and waterfalls sets the tone for Hohfluh, an Alpine retreat 
of unrivaled splendor. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 60 miles outside Zurich, Hohfluh is another world. The little village 
(pop. 400) faces Reichenbach Falls -- only a short drive from the Wetterhorn 
Mountains whose meadows unfold like velvet into valleys lost in mists. 
</P>
<P>
One autumn, before the snows fell, I discovered Hohfluh while searching for a 
peaceful retreat. I took shelter in a chalet with a stream running by its door 
-- this during a season when the leaves were turning, when the mountains were 
scarlet and gold, and so Hohfluh with its verdant pastures and autumn colors 
shall remain locked forever in the memory. 
</P>
<P>
On sunny days we would hike to the high meadows, and one morning we took the 
train to Meiringen, in the valley below, where we sipped rich chocolate and 
listened while a herd of cows passed in the street, bells ringing, in a 
symphony that spelled peace. 
</P>
<P>
It is with an abiding affection that I recall the village of Portofino on the 
Italian Riviera. Near Genoa, Portofino continues to attract crowds that 
surrender to its charms: pastel-colored buildings, a crescent-shaped harbor, 
sidewalk cafes and an ancient piazza where fishermen mend their nets and 
romantics appear at the sunset hour while others gather at La Stella and La 
Gritta for the evening cocktail ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Although Portofino is only a speck on the Gulf of Tigullio, it works as a drug: 
Everyone who goes there wants to return. Hillsides are smoky with olive trees, 
and poking out of the trees are restored castles and villas that overlook the 
gulf of the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Portofino's politicos had the good sense, years ago, to establish the village 
as a national monument, thus protecting it from unscrupulous developers. No 
Holiday Inn. Not a single disco. Portofino is a page out of the past that 
Winston Churchill put to canvas during repeated journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors seek shelter at the grand Hotel Splendido on a hillside, or else Hotel 
Nazionale, which faces the piazza. Marvelous pastas and seafood are prepared at 
Ristorante Il Pitosforo, Da U Batti and Trattoria al Navicello. Who wouldn't 
succumb to the charms of Portofino? I was hooked the moment I eyeballed the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Just as I was hooked by Puerto Vallarta before the developers invaded the 
Mexican Riviera. It was in the '60s, and Puerto Vallarta was a sight. Imagine, 
a village without TV or telephones. One could try reaching the outside world by 
radio, but with all the static, it was simply too annoying. 
</P>
<P>
There were no taxis in Puerto Vallarta. Only one-horse cabs. And only a single 
road. It was a bone-rattling, 14-hour ride from Tepico. When it rained, the 
road washed out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
In those days Puerto Vallarta was called the "Poor Man's" Acapulco. 
Pastel-colored adobes were piled like children's blocks up the hillsides and 
cobbled streets led to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
And whenever a freighter arrived, locals rowed out in dugout canoes to sell the 
crews beans and chili. This was before there was a pier, and so there were no 
ocean liners. Neither were there beggars or crime. The police had little to do 
but round up a stray pig or a goat and return the animals to their owners, who 
paid fines for letting the beasts run loose. 
</P>
<P>
One day I stopped for a beer at a cantina and a fighting cock fluttered in and 
perched on the stool beside me. The owner cursed and shooed it away with his 
bar towel. Yet the damned bird stood on the sidewalk crowing angrily. Afterward 
it ran squawking across the street, feathers flying, into an ice cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
At the Oceano Hotel a room with meals cost $14. Remember, this was in the '60s 
and greed hadn't set in. The hotel owner was content with Puerto Vallarta as it 
was, opposing any talk of building a road from Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
She sighed: "Tourists could ruin this peaceful village." 
</P>
<P>
Well, eventually the road was paved and after that the airlines began serving 
Puerto Vallarta and developers built their huge hotels. One that's described as 
a "hacienda" contains 434 rooms, four restaurants and three bars. This is a 
hacienda? 
</P>
<P>
Still, certain charms remain. Dawn continues to arrive softly and the sunsets 
are breathtaking and Puerto Vallarta's lovely old colonial section has been 
spared for posterity. So while it's not old Puerto Vallarta, it has its 
moments. And, well, provided the opportunity, I'd return in a jiffy.

CIVILIANS CAN CRUISE WITH NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JUNEAU, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How about a cruise ship without bartenders, bands, entertainment, waiters, gift 
shops, gourmet meals and midnight buffets? And most of the time without women! 
</P>
<P>
Such ships exist, Navy vessels that offer civilians a taste of how the military 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Voyages are for about a week and generally are for men only. Women guests are 
allowed to cruise only if the naval vessel has women as part of its crew. 
</P>
<P>
What you need is a sponsor from the ship, $5 a day for meals and proof that 
you're at least 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's tiger cruise program is available on any naval vessel, depending on 
ship schedules. 
</P>
<P>
I sailed on the Juneau, an amphibious-assault ship designed to put 800 Marines 
and their equipment ashore by helicopter or landing craft. 
</P>
<P>
Our destination was Alaska's capital, Juneau. And while 650 sailors and Marines 
arriving in a city of 30,000 amounted to an invasion, local hospitality ensured 
that it was a friendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
During the five-day cruise from San Diego, civilian guests, called "tigers," 
were accommodated in the same manner as their sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
With the good fortune to have been sponsored by an officer, I was one of four 
in a cabin with two triple tiers of bunks, individual lockers and the luxury of 
two writing desks and a wash basin, all in the color gray. 
</P>
<P>
Tigers sponsored by enlisted personnel were stacked four high, with tiny 
lockers, in the crew's living spaces -- common areas crossed by passageways, 
holding up to 100 men. On a cruise ship this would be equivalent to having a 
hammock in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the lack of portholes and the monochromatic color scheme, guests 
enjoy first-class treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The air is just as bracing, the Pacific Ocean just as majestic and the dolphins 
just as playful seen from the deck of a naval vessel as from a luxury liner. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is balanced, if not gourmet, served to officers in a paneled dining 
room on linen tablecloths, cafeteria-style in the enlisted mess. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked into tiny spaces throughout the ship are a library, a barber shop and 
"the mall," a tiny ship's store for sundries. 
</P>
<P>
Guests can jog (11 laps around the flight deck adds up to a mile), so there is 
no need for high-tech exercise machines. The Navy works 24 hours a day to keep 
its ships in shape at sea and the Juneau was sparkling. 
</P>
<P>
That's quite a trick when brass is constantly exposed to rain and saltwater 
spray. And if you remember withering looks from Mom after smudging her 
freshly-waxed linoleum with wet boots, imagine the same reaction from a 
6-foot-2 Marine. 
</P>
<P>
Guests have the run of the ship, and can wander anywhere from the engineering 
spaces well below decks to the bridge, where they can take the wheel, if 
conditions permit, and find out how fast 24,000 horsepower can push 17,000 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
There are other activities on board Navy ships not available to the average 
cruise ship passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The Juneau sailed with four other naval vessels, which practiced "leapfrogging" 
defensive maneuvers in heavy seas. The Marines gave daily equipment displays, 
so that guests could squeeze inside an M-60 tank one day and watch gun crews 
fire the World War II guns on another. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having 30 civilians, ages 8 to 68, wandering around underfoot, every 
crew member was a gracious host. Each explained his duties, answered questions 
and made each guest feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of hospitality began in 1880, when prospectors Joe Juneau and 
Richard T. Harris gave up after a perfunctory search for gold, and Chief Kowee 
of the Auk Tlingits convinced them to return and pointed them in the right 
direction, leading to a multimillion-dollar mining boom that peaked in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years earlier Juneau had become the state capital, and today its major 
employers are state government, commercial fishing and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Juneau is in the Alaska panhandle on the placid waters of Gastineau Channel, 
where pine-covered slopes are capped by snow even in July. 
</P>
<P>
The first look at the picturesque city between steep 3,500-foot peaks and the 
fine deep-water port makes it clear why Juneau's frontier atmosphere and 
natural beauty draw more than 350,000 visitors each year. 
</P>
<P>
All must arrive by sea or air (no roads connect Juneau to the rest of the 49th 
state) so it's no surprise that one-third of the citizenry are boat owners and 
one out of seven has a pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the vast glaciers that surround the city, summer temperatures are 
comfortably between 45 and 70 degrees and showers can be expected, although 
there was no rain during our five-day stay, and the skies were cloudless during 
four of them. 
</P>
<P>
At Juneau's high latitude that means about 18 hours of bright sunshine between 
dusklike midnights. 
</P>
<P>
Our ship's welcome began with a helicopter trailing a banner reading, "Welcome 
Home, USS Juneau." A mayor's delegation with Marine honor guard and bagpiper 
met us at the pier. (The city was in the midst of a drive for funds to erect a 
memorial to the first Juneau, which was torpedoed in the Solomon Islands during 
World War II and went down with 700 men.) 
</P>
<P>
In any case, visitors will find the people of Juneau open, friendly and proud 
of their city. 
</P>
<P>
Although Juneau's far-flung limits, encompassing more than 3,100 square miles, 
make it the city with the largest area in the nation, most of it is wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Everything in town is within walking distance of the harbor, including the 
governor's mansion and the excellent Alaska State Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The display detailing Juneau's mining days is built like an 1880s assay office, 
a full-size Tlingit long house highlights native artifacts and a two-story 
spiral ramp surrounds a lifelike eagle's nest. 
</P>
<P>
South Franklin Street has many historic buildings, including the gold rush-era 
Red Dog Saloon where Wyatt Earp once checked his guns. 
</P>
<P>
Present-day patrons can belly up and sample locally-brewed, award-winning 
Chinook beer, which proclaims on every bottle: "Made with the finest 
ingredients available at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most beautiful churches are outside of town. The half century-old 
Shrine of St. Terese sits on its own island surrounded by tall pines, connected 
to the mainland by a rock causeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapel by the Lake is a log-cabin church with a picture window behind the 
altar that provides churchgoers with a marvelous view of Mendenhall glacier. 
</P>
<P>
The glacier is an easy 10 minute drive from downtown -- by car or city bus. The 
visitor center offers spectacular views of the glacier, ice floes on Mendenhall 
Lake and the towering mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Half a mile beyond and about 300 yards past the sign that says, "No Hiking 
Beyond This Point," the "Because It Was There" crowd can leave their footprints 
on the 1,500 square mile river of ice. 
</P>
<P>
Any hike in the Juneau area is rewarding, with many trail heads starting at the 
ends of downtown streets. You're also likely to find lots of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Black bears have been sighted on city streets, migrating whales make frequent 
appearances in the narrow waterways and bald eagles dive for salmon in the 
channel or nest in the tallest pines overlooking such rocky beaches as Outer 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
And while Juneau's shores don't offer the uninterrupted sand of Southern 
California beaches, midnight sunbathers can catch more rays in a single Alaska 
summer day than they could in a long weekend at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
For the more adventurous, float planes will give you an Adm. Byrd's-eye view of 
the spectacular landscape, or a sightseeing helicopter will whisk you to the 
top of a glacier and put you on ice. 
</P>
<P>
You can take a float trip down the meandering waters of the icy Mendenhall 
River or go deep-sea fishing for some of Alaska's deliciously famous king 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't reel in your own, the Gold Creek Mine salmon bake is a real 
treat. For about $16, it's an all you can eat feast. 
</P>
<P>
The salmon is broiled on a huge open-pit grill, basted with brown sugar and 
butter sauce. Having traveled no more than a couple of miles from the ocean to 
table, it is fresh enough to literally melt in diner's mouths. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner you can explore the extensive grounds and abandoned machinery of 
the Gold Creek Mine or pan for gold in a roaring mountain stream. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in town for Independence Day, the fireworks' glittering reflection in 
the bay is sensational, and even at midnight it's still light enough for the 
scenery to lend a majestic backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
But whenever you visit this frontier town you'll find vistas to admire, 
adventures to retell and memories to last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has a variety of programs that offer civilians short voyages. 
Participation is by getting a congressman as a sponsor, by contacting the naval 
base commander in your area or by being the dependant of a sailor on sea duty. 
</P>
<P>

TAKING THE ART OF TRAVEL TO SPLENDID NEW DEPTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is there anywhere travelers haven't gone? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the least accessible destination on this shrinking globe has been the 
mysterious realm beneath the sea, but even that is no longer forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
Take a deep breath, folks, and hold it; you may be traveling underwater soon. 
</P>
<P>
New and unusual opportunities to tour -- or at least view -- the shadowy depths 
are becoming increasingly available. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, underwater sightseeing was limited mostly to scuba divers and 
snorkelers. They alone had the pleasure of exploring the world's tropical reefs 
and sea gardens -- the habitat of rare and colorful fish and strange marine 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, even the less-adventurous traveler can journey beneath the sea fairly 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
There's a fleet of six sightseeing submarines, the Atlantis I through VI, that 
carry passengers in submerged voyages from resort islands in the Pacific and 
Caribbean. All have large viewing windows on each side and in the nose. 
</P>
<P>
If this whets your appetite, consider spending a night in what may be the 
world's only underwater lodge. The hotel, with only two guest rooms, is on the 
floor of a lagoon on the Atlantic shore of Key Largo, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Although anyone can stay there, unless you're a licensed diver you will have to 
practice diving techniques for two to three hours at the front desk before 
you'll be allowed to descend to your room. 
</P>
<P>
Since underwater sightseeing is an obvious complement to a beach vacation, what 
follows is a list of half a dozen unusual possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
They include a luxury cruise for divers in Indonesia, snorkeling tours in 
public parklands in Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, a visit to an 
underwater aquarium in the Caribbean and a trio of research expeditions to the 
reefs of Fiji, Bonaire and the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
To view the realm beneath the sea: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Book passage on a submarine. The Atlantis fleet has been growing rapidly. 
Vessels give passengers an eye-to-eye view of a multitude of sea creatures. 
It's the next best thing to diving, and you won't have to worry about a shark 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis submarines operate regularly from Grand Cayman Island, Barbados and 
St. Thomas in the Caribbean; Oahu and Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands, and Guam 
in the Pacific. A seventh will begin sailing from Aruba in the southern 
Caribbean next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The subs on Grand Cayman and Barbados -- named Atlantis I and II -- were built 
to hold 28 passengers each. The others are larger, each seating 46 passengers. 
All are operated by a three-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
The newest subs, which look as if they've been borrowed from a modernistic ride 
in a Walt Disney theme park, are 65 feet long. Each side sports 13 circular 
viewing windows, each two feet in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
An extra-large window in the bow, a giant porthole, enables passengers to see 
directly ahead. The vessels are air conditioned, and normal sea-surface 
atmospheric pressure is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
A cruise lasts about an hour. The high-tech subs can submerge to about 150 feet 
but generally do not go below 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
For safety's sake, the pilot and copilot follow a regular itinerary. Overhead, 
a surface vessel sails the same path as the sub, alerting other boats to the 
sub below. 
</P>
<P>
Some night cruises are offered. Underwater colors are brighter at night when a 
spotlight from a sub is shined on them. For information, contact the tourism 
office of the island you're interested in visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spend a night on the ocean floor. There are two rooms with undersea view, 
meals included. Your host for these unusual accommodations is Jules' Undersea 
Lodge of Key Largo, just south of Miami. The rooms have become so popular since 
they were opened three years ago that you may have to reserve months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, shaped somewhat like an oversized trailer, was built as an 
underwater research station in Puerto Rico, a function it served for several 
years. In 1986, an investor bought it, moved it to Key Largo and sunk it 30 
feet to the bottom of a two-acre, ocean-fed lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The habitat has two private bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a sitting room. 
It is equipped with telephone and television. Maximum occupancy usually is six 
guests, but eight can be accommodated. Each of the bedrooms has a large window 
looking into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, you'll see 75 to 80 species of fish during daylight hours, manager 
Nancy Fabiano says. At night, lights can be flicked on when shrimp, crab and 
lobsters are active. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner and breakfast, part of an overnight package, are prepared ahead. When 
you are hungry, you pop them into the microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
Most guests are experienced divers, which is handy because you have to dive to 
get to your room. But lodge personnel will train you sufficiently to make the 
round trip accompanied by a guide each way. 
</P>
<P>
A special breathing hose and mouthpiece is used. Claustrophobic people might 
want to skip this adventure. 
</P>
<P>
For the lodge's Aquanaut Program (check in at 1 p.m., check out at 11 a.m. the 
following day), the rate is $295 per person a night, including full meals, 
snacks and unlimited diving. A less expensive version provides for 5:30 p.m. 
check-in, 9:30 a.m. check-out and light meals for $195 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge is operated jointly with Key Largo Undersea Park, which opened last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The park offers guided snorkeling tours of the lagoon and the exterior of the 
underwater lodge. Snorkelers are given a device so they can hear what the guide 
is saying. Unlike the snorkelers, the guide walks the bottom of the lagoon in 
scuba gear. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour tour is $12 for adults, $10 for children and $35 for a family of 
four. Equipment is included. 
</P>
<P>
Armchair explorers can "take a tour" seated inside the park auditorium. A guide 
moves about the lagoon while a live camera sends the image to the theater 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
A two-way communications system allows the viewers to question the guide and 
hear the response. Admission is $6 for adults and $4 for children. 
</P>
<P>
For information on all three programs, contact Jules' Undersea Lodge, P.O. Box 
3330, Key Largo, Fla. 33037, (305) 451-2353. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go snorkeling in a public park. At least two large underwater parks, one in 
Florida and the other in the U.S. Virgin Islands, offer snorkelers good 
opportunities for guided excursions. 
</P>
<P>
The most conveniently sited is Florida's John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park 
on Key Largo about half a mile from Jules' Undersea Lodge. About 21 1/2 miles 
long and 6 1/2 miles wide, the park is habitat for hundreds of species of fish. 
On the ocean floor are the wrecks of many ships. 
</P>
<P>
Snorkeling trips and glass-bottom boat cruises are provided by a park 
concessionaire, Coral Reef Park Co. 
</P>
<P>
On half-day snorkeling trips, you are ferried out to the reef about six miles 
from shore, where you will spend about 2 1/2 hours exploring the sea life. The 
trips depart daily at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and are limited to six people. The cost 
is $30 per person. Equipment is included. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is one of the 90-minute trips. It departs at 9 a.m., noon and 3 
p.m., and the limit is 60 participants. Cost is $19 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The glass-bottom boat, which carries 100 passengers, departs at 9 a.m., noon 
and 3 p.m. for a 2 1/2-hour cruise. Cost is $11. For snorkeling and cruise 
reservations, call toll-free (800) 344-8175. 
</P>
<P>
Just offshore from St. Croix in the Virgin Islands is a small, unpopulated 
island designated Buck Island Reef National Monument. The designation protects 
the island's 180 acres, plus 700 acres of surrounding Caribbean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists to St. Croix generally reach the island on half a day or one-day tours 
offered by any of seven concessionaires licensed by the U.S. Park Service. 
Ticket offices are on the wharf at Christiansted. By power boat the traveling 
time is 30 to 40 minutes -- by sail, 60 to 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Island is blessed with one of the loveliest white-sand beaches in the 
Caribbean. Beginner snorkelers generally are given a short lesson near the 
beach, and then the group (no more than six per guide) sails to a mooring on 
the southeast tip of the island. This is the beginning of the Buck Island 
Underwater Trail, which winds through a complex and colorful marine garden. 
</P>
<P>
Water along the trail is about 15 feet deep. Resting floats are provided if you 
tire of swimming. A half-day trip concludes with the tour. A full-day tour 
includes time for swimming, sunbathing and hiking on Buck Island. Rates are 
about $25 per person for half a day and $50 for a full day, which includes 
refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
St. Croix is still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Hugo, but tourism 
authorities expect the island to be back on its feet and in shape to welcome 
visitors by May. Special spring lodging packages are being offered to attract 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Visit an underwater aquarium. St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands is home to 
Coral World, a popular attraction for cruise line passengers who want a peek at 
the sea beneath their ship. 
</P>
<P>
Coral World makes that possible with its observation tower, which descends 
rather then ascends. The circular tower is offshore about 50 feet and can be 
reached by crossing a long ramp. 
</P>
<P>
From the surface, the underwater tower drops three levels. At the bottom people 
are under 15 feet of water. Wide windows that encircle the tower look out upon 
the sea life of St. Thomas. 
</P>

IT'S TEE TIME FOR AUSTRIANS WHO LOVE TO GOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE TYLER, Tyler is a free-lance writer living in Burlingame, Calif. 
</P>

<P>
POERTSCHACH, Austria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The farmer eyed us with a look of suspicion. There we were, flailing away with 
long sticks in what had once been his most barren field. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was all closely cropped, lush-green. In the distance a bright flag 
flapped, beckoning toward the target. It's a scene you see often driving around 
Austria, for golf is on a roll in Europe -- and this pastoral, mountainous 
little country is getting in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago there were only 28 golf courses in Austria; this year there are 
34. By next year there is likely to be 48. At an average cost per course of $3 
million, Austria's investors are anxious to start banking greens fees, even if 
it means sharing the golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Nine hoteliers banded together to build an 18-hole golf course called Gold Club 
Austria, in Carinthia. Eighteen more holes will open this year. 
</P>
<P>
A tourist region in the southernmost province of the country known as the 
"Riviera of Austria" for its long, balmy, sunny summer days, Carinthia has been 
popular for years with Germans, Italians, Scandinavians and Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
But how to appeal to traveling Americans to get them off the usual tourist 
route? Their solution: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Under the umbrella name Carinthia Golf Tours, they're offering a 14-day golf 
and sightseeing package that covers all of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The stay at Poertschach (pronounced percher) is the longest (seven days). 
Included are a shopping expedition half an hour over the border at Tarvisio, 
Italy; a day in Venice and a game at Golf Club Bled in Yugoslavia, a two-hour 
drive in the opposite direction over hairpin, twisting Loibl Pass. 
</P>
<P>
The package is for golfers who like their sport studded with castles, mountain 
ranges, pristine lakes, sheep, cows, meadows, picturesque villages and Old 
World cities. 
</P>
<P>
And the quality of the golf? Always pleasant and easygoing (except for the new 
Jack Nicklaus course outside Salzburg, his first on the continent and a 
rampaging terror). 
</P>
<P>
The challenges always fit the landscape, be it weaving through trees, 
dog-legging around cow barns, lining up your shots with steeples or trying to 
ignore the soaring scenery -- the stuff that inspires artists and composers of 
symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
Pack a light bag, a minimum of clubs and your most comfortable shoes. You'll 
walk over natural rolling terrain, some of it terribly hilly. 
</P>
<P>
There's one exception -- the golfplatz at mod-minded Poertschach. In an effort 
to cater to Americans it has 11 riding carts, giving it the largest fleet of 
golf carts in Austria and one of the largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bring plenty of golf balls. They're expensive here and easily lost in the tall 
grass of the rough and in the natural ponds (used by ice skaters in winter). 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian golf season is long, beginning about April and lasting through 
October. May or September is the ideal time to play. I can happily vouch for 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans are pretty good golfers. To be able to get out on a course in Europe 
they have to prove they can play. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Americans are exempt from this "prove it" syndrome, but if you're 
traveling on your own, take along your handicap or club membership card or a 
letter from your pro at home, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, golf pros in Austria often do not know what the greens fees are 
at their own courses. Greens fees are now $30 to $50, up from $20 to $30, 
although the Nicklaus course extracts $60 weekdays, $75 weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Such money matters, including the rental of pull carts or the seldom-available 
caddies, are the domain of the Sekretariat. 
</P>
<P>
The pros, who are usually Englishmen fluent in German, are there just to give 
lessons, run tournaments and sell equipment. (Tip: English rain suits, at about 
$150, are an excellent buy.) 
</P>
<P>
Intensif Kurs golf schools are everywhere, costing from about $700 (room and 
meals included) a week. Also costing about $700 are seven-day hotel packages 
with unlimited golf -- but you have to prove you can play before they'll let 
you sign up. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you're in a group, you don't make tee times. Simply appear (remember to 
bring proof you can play), although you'd be smart to phone ahead to make sure 
there's no tournament being played. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian courses don't have drinking fountains, so pack a flask if you're 
inclined to get thirsty. They have no snack stands on the courses, either. 
Think ahead at the generous Austrian breakfast buffets, which are included in 
the room rates, and stash an apple, bread and cheese in your golf bag. 
</P>
<P>
Courses on the tour are the Sudsteirische Golf Langen near Graz (par 72); 
Kartner (Carinthian) Golf Club, Dellach, by the Woerthersee (par 70); Golf Club 
Austria at Moosburg near Poertschach (par 72); Golf Club Bled, Yugoslavia (par 
73); Golf Club Zell am See/Kaprun (Austria's first 27-hole layout; par 72); 
Golf Club Gut Altentann (Estate of the Old Trees) at Henndorf outside Salzburg 
(par 72); Golf Club Brandelhof, near Saalfelden (par 72), and Mondsee, near 
Salzburg (par 72). 
</P>
<P>
They've been playing golf in Austria since 1901. Golf Club Wien (Vienna) is the 
country's oldest. It's set within a horse racing track. 
</P>
<P>
Salzburg's most popular sightseeing tour visits locations where major scenes in 
the "The Sound of Music" were filmed. Many tourists have been so entranced by 
the "wedding church" at Mondsee that they returned to the village to stay a few 
days. So Mondsee, too, will soon have a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Carinthia Golf Tours depart from Los Angeles in May, June, September and 
October. Cost is about $3,300 per person, round-trip air fare included. For 
more information, write to Carinthia at 2035 Westwood Blvd., Suite 210, Los 
Angeles 90025, or call (213) 444-9714. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Golf Assn. is sponsoring a "Sound of Golf Balls" 
Austria tour with the same itinerary, June 16-30. Cost is about $3,800 per 
person. For more information, call (213) 877-0185.

LEAVING HELSINKI FOR 'REAL' FINLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Finland for two years.

<P>
HELSINKI, Finland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, in a quiet Helsinki park, I met a Finnish beauty named Seija who 
at first seemed interested in my impressions of her country. But when I told 
her I had not yet explored life outside the capital, she could not hide her 
impatience. 
</P>
<P>
"So you haven't been outside HEL-sinki," she said, accenting the first syllable 
as Finns do. "That's too bad. You won't meet any Finns in Helsinki." 
</P>
<P>
She had dismissed me as a typical tourist. What she didn't know was that I had 
lived in Finland for a few years when I was in my twenties and already was 
familiar with her wonderful country of diverse scenery and fascinating people. 
</P>
<P>
Helsinki is an interesting stopover for anyone visiting Leningrad or Moscow. 
But Seija was right. Away from the city, the rewards are even greater. 
</P>
<P>
The real Finland is small towns and country villages -- places where one can 
observe what Finns call sisu, the steely determination that has kept Finland 
independent despite 40 wars with neighboring Russia. 
</P>
<P>
During my four remaining days in Helsinki I decided to take four day-trips from 
the central city; trips designed to bring me in closer contact with Finnish 
culture. The destinations were easy to reach on inexpensive public 
transportation, which provides excellent service for the English-speaking 
visitor. 
</P>
<P>
In assessing my needs, I decided that what I most needed was relaxation. I had 
been told Haikko was the ideal place. 
</P>
<P>
Haikko Manor is a luxurious mineral spa about 18 miles from Helsinki. A large 
estate on 25 acres, it has a fully-equipped fitness center where one can take 
part in aerobics, slosh around in a mud bath or simply relax in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel interior is a pleasant surprise. The anteroom and guest suites have 
been restored to their original 19th-Century appearance, with antique armoires 
and four-poster beds in the manor's 27 double rooms. 
</P>
<P>
As I entered the foyer, an ersatz version of a czar's summer home, I was 
offered a glass of domestic champagne made from white currants. It was a 
fitting prelude to the unusual day ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment began in the sauna, a Finnish invention, and as I entered, I wondered 
if I would be on the menu that evening, wilting under 220 degrees of 
birch-scented heat. 
</P>
<P>
A Finn demonstrated the use of the viihta, the bundled twigs the Finns use to 
increase circulation. I beat myself silly with the things, hoping no one was 
looking. When I had turned a bright borscht-red, I retired to a private room to 
relax and slake my thirst with a cold beer. 
</P>
<P>
With my energy restored, I plunged into the dining room for a first-class 
smorgasbord. Others with stamina signed up for water gymnastics and 
weightlifting, but I'll take smoked salmon, pickled herring and fresh berries 
as a responsible alternative, any day. 
</P>
<P>
Haikko Manor offers special packages determined by the length of your visit. A 
20-minute massage costs about $17. Rates for the more complex treatments rise 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Haikko is 35 minutes by taxi (about $60, one way), one hour by bus and two 
hours by boat (summers only) from downtown Helsinki. For overnight guests, 
manor rates begin at about $160 per double and include swimming, sauna, 
breakfast and service charges. 
</P>
<P>
The next day I journeyed to a small Finnish town I remembered from my travels 
nearly two decades before. 
</P>
<P>
Porvoo is one of Finland's four 15th-Century medieval towns constructed by 
Hanseatic traders. About 25 miles away, it is the closest of the four to 
Helsinki and according to many Finns, the most beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
The name "Porvoo" means "castle on the river," although the original castle 
there did not survive the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
I arrived on a bus at a gently bubbling river lined with red-roofed waterside 
storehouses. I stopped a Finn and asked about the buildings. "They were used 
for storing salt," he said, in perfect English. "We Finns are a salty race." 
</P>
<P>
At Tuomiokirkko (Porvoo Cathedral) I explored the gray stone church, the oldest 
surviving structure in Porvoo from that period. The church was built in 1418, 
gutted partially by fire in 1708 during the Great Northern War, and rebuilt 
during that century. It is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
As I entered I was drawn to the artfully marbled pulpit and gallery, 
reconstructed in 1729 by Johan Friedrich Schultze. Look for the artist's mark 
behind the organ, on the church's back wall. It is an eerie, mysterious 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the old town's buildings date from the early 18th Century. Much of the 
original architecture was demolished by fire in 1760 and reconstructed by the 
townspeople themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The town hall, built in 1746, was partially saved and renovated. Today it is a 
historical museum. Adjacent to it, Holm House, an art museum, displays period 
pieces painted by Albert Edelfelt and sculptures by Ville Vallgren, both 
celebrated artists in Finland. The buildings are open daily. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe life is very much a part of old town Porvoo. Finns are, for reasons 
unknown, the No. 1 coffee drinkers in Europe. Porvoo residents more than hold 
their own. I whiled away the better part of a sunny afternoon in a charming 
little cafe called Helmi, at Valikatu 7, chatting with a young Finnish couple 
on their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
We nibbled pulla, yeasty little buns flavored with cardamom and rock sugar, and 
spooned thick local cream into the muddy coffee. The afternoon passed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Buses for Porvoo leave every hour from Helsinki's Central Bus Depot, at 
Simonkatu 3. The ride takes about 45 minutes. If you visit between May and 
September, a boat, the J. L. Runeberg, leaves Helsinki daily at 10 a.m. and 
arrives Porvoo at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that you cannot take the boat in both directions and still have time 
to see the town the same day. Further information is available at the city's 
municipal office, at Rihkamatori A. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday I wanted to stay closer to my hotel. There was an ideal option. 
Suomenlinna (literally "Finland castle") is a picturesque island only 20 
minutes from the main harbor by public ferry. What's more, it is accessible all 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Getting there is fun. Board a small tug marked "Suomenlinna" at Helsinki's 
waterside marketplace and pay 75 cents on board. We swept past private islands 
and rocky shoals in the Helsinki archipelago, and saw families rigging their 
sails for an afternoon cruise. 
</P>
<P>
The day was so clear that I could see Estonia, the Soviet republic on the 
Baltic sea. It was visible across the Gulf of Finland about 40 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Suomenlinna is a fortress in name only. But in the early 18th Century the 
Swedish navy built it as a garrison to counter the threat of attack from the 
east. In 1918, the year Finland achieved independence from the Russian 
Bolsheviks, the island passed into the hands of the local authorities. It has 
been open to the public since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 900 residents live a peaceful life there and visitors come to picnic, 
party, absorb culture and relax. I arrived early in the day. That's when I met 
Jarmo, a mathematics professor from a local university, who was taking his 
family out for the day. Traditionally reticent, Jarmo, like other Finns, seemed 
all too happy to practice English on a foreign visitor away from the chaos of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
I joined Jarmo at Piper, a wonderful, weather-beaten wooden coffee shop with 
grand columns at the entrance. Fresh baked cinnamon rolls, country eggs and hot 
spice tea made for a grand breakfast, as we listened to the wash of the sea 
from a long table on the veranda. We watched dozens of Finns sunning themselves 
on terraced rocks overlooking the surf. Some had spread out blankets for a 
summer picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Suomenlinna has seven museums. Follow the path hugging the shore and you can't 
miss them. Armfelt Museum is a storehouse of antique furniture and maritime 
artifacts. Ehrensvard Museum is the fully restored home of an 18th-Century 
Swedish naval officer. 
</P>
<P>
Suomenlinna has a wonderful fortress restaurant called Walhalla where you'll 
find serious eaters from Helsinki. Walhalla, which is several hundred years 
old, is a large bomb-proof dining hall with excavated brick walls and regal 
appointments. It features dishes such as salted salmon and roasted game. 
</P>
<P>
A three-course lunch is available for less than $20 a person. The baked potato 
alone is worth the journey from Helsinki. Boats returning to Helsinki leave 
every half hour. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious day-trip of the four is also the most rewarding. Tampere is 
the regional capital of Hame province, about 130 miles from Helsinki. I lived 
there for two years and loved it. 
</P>
<P>
To get there this time I rented a car in Helsinki and headed north on Finland's 
E4. En route, I passed through some of Finland's most spectacular scenery. In 2 
1/2 hours I was home. 
</P>
<P>
Tampere is a mill town that grew up along the banks of a river, the 
Tammerkoski. Flanking the central city isthmus are two large lakes, Nasijarvi 
and Pyhajarvi. 
</P>
<P>
I was there to see the many works by Finland's world-famous architect, Reima 
Pietila. Pietila's work reflects a post-modern, environmentalist style and is 
well suited to the charms of the city. The main city library, at Pirjankatu 2, 
is his most recent completion. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1986, its stone, glass and copper motif resembles a large sculpture, 
like many of the architect's works. 
</P>
<P>
Other Pietila buildings, such as Kaleva church and Hervanta town center, are 
scattered throughout Tampere. A guide to Pietila's work is available at the 
City Tourist Office at Verkatentaankatu 2. 
</P>
<P>
Tampere has had considerably less foreign influence than Helsinki, as strongly 
evidenced in its cuisine. Those who live there will tell you it is more Finnish 
than what is eaten in Helsinki. I stopped by the market square for local 
delicacies, looking for the hometown black pudding called verimakkara, a 
sausage made from liver and rice. There, something amazing happened. 
</P>
<P>
The same woman who sold the pudding 20 years ago is still there and recognized 
me. We chatted while I ate two enormous pieces of sausage. "So," she said, "I 
haven't seen you in a while. And why hasn't your Finnish gotten any better?" 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon I went to Rustholli for a country-style Finnish lunch of 
reindeer steak, pike-perch and lanttu laatikko, a farm table casserole made 
from rutabaga, at Rusthollinkatu 16. Rustholli is a hotel restaurant on Lake 
Nasi, about six miles from the city center. A No. 28 bus will transport you 
there in about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Driving back to Helsinki in late afternoon I squeezed in a visit to Iitala, 35 
miles south of Tampere. Iitala is home to Finland's largest glassworks, 
Nuutajarvi. Tours are offered daily and this is the place to buy Finnish 
crystal at cut-rate prices in the factory outlet store. Seconds with tiny 
blemishes are sold at a fraction of the cost of similar items sold in Helsinki 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I arrived in Helsinki at 10 p.m. It was dusk and I was tired. I walked through 
the park where I had met Seija four nights earlier, hoping to see her again. 
But the park was empty except for one harmless drunk.

<P>
Rocky Mountain National Park is in north-central Colorado and can be reached 
from the east by car on U.S. 34, U.S. 36 and Colorado 7. Highways 36 and 7 both 
reach Boulder, but the narrow, winding Colorado 7 offers beautiful views of 
southeastern portions of the park. 
</P>
<P>
The park also can be reached from the west by U.S. 40, which connects with 34. 
Estes Park is about 65 miles north of Denver, 91 miles south of Cheyenne, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
Campgrounds in and around the park are abundant. Estes Park is a quaint village 
catering to visitors who do not like to camp. It offers many accommodations and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the area's most famous hotel is the Stanley Hotel (333 Wonderview Ave., 
Estes Park), which was the inspiration behind Stephen King's novel, "The 
Shining." Room rates are between $60 and $120 a night all year. The hotel also 
offers two luxury suites for $150 a night. For more information, call (303) 
586-3371. 
</P>
<P>
Alpine Trail Ridge Inn, 927 Moraine Ave., Moraine Route, Estes Park, offers 
more moderate accommodations from May 1 to Oct. 15. It is at the entrance of 
the park. Fran Grooters said her hotel offers hiking packages and trail 
information. Nightly room rates are from $46 double to $86 for six. Call (303) 
586-4585. 
</P>
<P>
For more area hotel and restaurant information, call the Estes Park Chamber of 
Commerce at (303) 586-4431. 
</P>
<P>
Recommending hikes in the park is difficult due to the wide variety available. 
Kent and Donna Dannens' book, "Short Hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park," is 
helpful for inexperienced visitors. It is $4 at the park's visitor centers. 
Maps given at the park's entrances also mention the area's most popular trails. 
For less-traveled paths, ask about hikes out of Grand Lakes in the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Rocky Mountain National Park, call the National Park 
Service at (303) 586-2371, or write: c/o Superintendent, Rocky Mountain 
National Park, Estes Park, Colo. 80517-8397.

As a teacher of geography and an airline buff, I was disappointed to find 
several glaring errors in the "Can You Guess?" trivia quiz. They are: 1) The 
airline of Spain is IBERIA not Iberian; 2) it's Qantas not Quantas; 3) LACSA 
not LASCA (Lineas Aereas Costarricenses S.A.) and 4) Colombia not Columbia.

I am amazed that with your wealth of travel information you would allow such 
serious mistakes on the part of Robert Guenther's "Can You Guess?" He places 
the Tiger Balm Gardens in Singapore rather than Hong Kong, where they belong, 
and has the Pitti Palace transferred from Florence to Venice. Shame on you.

THE FINAL HOURS: RICHARD M. NIXON IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Richard M. Nixon, Former President Richard M. Nixon's remarks are excerpted 
from In the Arena: A Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal, to be published 
this month by Simon &amp; Schuster.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Watergate break-in first hit the news, my press secretary, Ron 
Ziegler, aptly called it a third-rate burglary. To compare Watergate with 
Teapot Dome, the Truman 5-percenter scandals and the Grant Whiskey scandals 
misses the point totally. No one in the Nixon Administration profited from 
Watergate. No one ripped off the government, as was the case in previous 
scandals. Wrongdoing took place, but not for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
All administrations have sought to protect themselves from the political 
fallout of scandals. I detailed my mistakes in this respect at length in my 
memoirs, a third of which dwelt on Watergate. In retrospect, I would say that 
Watergate was one part wrongdoing, one part blundering and one part political 
vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate break-in and cover-up greatly damaged the American political 
process. While not unusual in political campaigns, these actions were clearly 
illegal. Over the years, I had been the victim of political dirty tricks and 
other kinds of vicious tactics in the cut-and-thrust of political warfare. What 
happened in Watergate -- the facts, not the myths -- was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, while I was not involved in the decision to conduct the 
break-in, I should have set a higher standard for the conduct of the people who 
participated in my campaign and Administration. I should have established a 
moral tone that would have made such actions unthinkable. I did not. I played 
by the rules of politics as I found them. Not taking a higher road than my 
predecessors and my adversaries was my central mistake. For that reason, I long 
ago accepted overall responsibility for the Watergate affair. What's more, I 
have paid, and am still paying, the price for it. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from its illegality, Watergate was a tragedy of errors. Whoever ordered 
the break-in evidently knew little about politics. If the purpose was to gather 
political intelligence, the Democratic National Committee was a pathetic 
target. Strategy and tactics are set by the candidate and his staff, not the 
party bureaucracy. Moreover, in view of the 30% lead I had in the polls, it 
made no sense to take such a risk because the likely Democratic nominee, Sen. 
George McGovern, stood virtually no chance of winning. I also contributed to 
the errors. As a student of history, I should have known that leaders who do 
big things well must be on the guard against stumbling on the little things. To 
paraphrase Talleyrand, Watergate was worse than a crime -- it was a blunder. 
</P>
<P>
When I was first informed about the break-in I did not give it sufficient 
attention, partly because I was preoccupied with my China and Soviet 
initiatives and with my efforts to end the war in Vietnam and partly because I 
feared that some of my close political colleagues might be somehow involved. 
Some have said that my major mistake was to protect my subordinates. They may 
be partly right. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that in any organization loyalty must run down, as well as up. I knew 
those who were involved acted not out of desire for personal gain but out of 
their deep belief in our cause. That knowledge may have contributed to my 
hesitation in tackling the question. In retrospect, it is clear that I should 
have focused on the issue immediately, dug out the truth on a top-priority 
basis, fired everyone involved and taken the political heat. 
</P>
<P>
But what we remember as the Watergate period was also a concerted political 
vendetta by my opponents. Anyone who knows the workings of hardball politics 
knows that the smoke screen of false accusations -- the myths of Watergate -- 
were not at all accidental. In this respect, Watergate was not a morality play 
-- a battle between good guys in white and bad guys in black -- but rather a 
political struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The baseless and highly sensationalistic charges, the blatant double standard, 
the party-line votes in congressional investigating committees, and the 
unwillingness of my adversaries and the media to look into parallel wrongdoing 
within Democratic campaigns, all should tip off even the casual observer that 
the opposition was pursuing not only justice but also political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Only in 1982 was it revealed how a small group of liberal Democrats tried to 
exploit this advantage during Watergate. For a brief period in 1973, after Vice 
President Spiro Agnew resigned in a personal scandal unrelated to Watergate and 
before Gerald Ford was confirmed by the Senate, Democrat Carl Albert, the 
Speaker of the House, stood next in line to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Sorensen, a former speech writer for President Kennedy and a highly 
partisan critic of my policies, asked Albert for permission to write a secret 
"comprehensive contingency plan" so that the Democrats could take over the 
White House swiftly if I were to leave office. Albert agreed. The plan even 
included suggestions for the tone of the new President's inaugural address and 
an agenda for his first week in office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Partisan Dimension 
</P>
<P>
Albert is a fine American who wouldn't have been involved in anything improper. 
But the prospect of winning through Watergate what they had failed to win at 
the polls was evidently too much for some Democrats to resist. Albert himself 
quoted Bella Abzug, then a left-wing congresswoman from New York, as saying to 
him, "Get off your goddamned ass, and we can take this presidency." So it was 
without irony that in my memoirs I referred to the final struggle over 
Watergate as my final political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
When a balanced historical appraisal emerges, the partisan political dimension 
of the investigation and prosecution will stand out as a prominent feature of 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
As I wrote my memoirs, I was able to look back at Watergate and separate myth 
from fact. At the core of the scandal was the fact that individuals associated 
with my reelection campaign were caught breaking into and installing telephone 
wiretaps at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the 
Watergate Hotel. After their arrest, others in my campaign and in my 
Administration attempted to cover up this connection in order to minimize the 
political damage. I failed to take matters firmly into my own hands and 
discover the facts and to fire any and all people involved or implicated in the 
break-in. I was also accused of taking part in the cover-up by trying to 
obstruct the FBI's criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Alone, that would probably not have been enough to bring down my 
Administration. But the term Watergate has come to include a wide range of 
other charges that my adversaries used to try to paint my Administration as, in 
their words, "the most corrupt in American history." Together, these 
accusations represented the myths of Watergate, the smoke screen of false 
charges that ultimately undercut my Administration's ability to govern 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
The most blatantly false myth was that I ordered the break-in at the Democratic 
headquarters. Millions of dollars were spent by the executive branch, the 
Congress and the office of the special prosecutor to investigate Watergate. Not 
one piece of evidence was discovered indicating that I ordered the break-in, 
knew about the plans for the wiretapping or received any information from it. 
</P>
<P>
The most politically damaging myth was that I personally ordered the payment of 
money to Howard Hunt and the other original Watergate defendants to keep them 
silent. I did discuss this possibility during a meeting with John Dean and Bob 
Haldeman on March 21, 1973. In the tape recording of this meeting, it is clear 
that I considered paying the money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Smoking Gun' Tape' 
</P>
<P>
I should not have even considered this option, but the key facts were that I 
rejected offering clemency to the defendants as "wrong" and at the end of the 
conversation ruled out any White House payment of money to the defendants. 
Moreover, those who made this accusation ignored the even more crucial fact 
that no payments were made as a result of that conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious myth -- and the one that ultimately forced me to resign -- was 
that, in my specific orders, the CIA obstructed the FBI from pursuing its 
criminal investigation of the Watergate break-in. I discussed this possible 
course of action with Bob Haldeman in the famous "smoking gun" tape of June 23, 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, I thought that in view of the fact that some former CIA 
operatives had participated in the Watergate break-in, the CIA would be 
concerned that their exposure would, in turn, reveal other legitimate 
operations and operatives, and that the agency would therefore welcome a chance 
to avoid that outcome. I thought that would also serve our political interests 
because it would prevent the FBI from going into areas that would be 
politically embarrassing to us. 
</P>
<P>
In my conversation with Haldeman, I made the inexcusable error of following the 
recommendation from some members of my staff -- some of whom, I later learned, 
had a personal stake in covering up the facts -- and requesting that the CIA 
intervene. But that mistake was mitigated by two facts. 
</P>
<P>
First, because of the good judgment of the director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, Richard Helms, and his deputy, Vernon Walters, they ignored the White 
House request and refused to intervene with the FBI, despite the pressure from 
members of my staff. 
</P>
<P>
Second, when FBI Director L. Patrick Gray complained to me in a telephone call 
three weeks later on July 12 about attempts to suppress his investigation, I 
told him emphatically to go forward with it, and I instructed Haldeman and John 
Ehrlichman to make sure the campaign and the Administration cooperated with the 
investigation "all the way down the line." No obstruction of justice took place 
as a result of the June 23 conversation. 
</P>
<P>
After I completed my memoirs, the only time I addressed Watergate at any length 
was in the televised interviews conducted by David Frost. I agreed to make the 
broadcasts not by choice but by necessity. I faced a major financial crunch 
because of attorneys' fees. The entire amount I received from the broadcasts of 
$540,000 went to my lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The weeks of preparing for and the 26 hours of taping the broadcasts proved to 
be the major ordeal of my stay in San Clemente. Writing my memoirs required me 
to engage in detached analysis and intense concentration. The Frost interview 
required me to gird for intellectual combat. I did not expect the telecasts to 
be positive or even balanced, and I was not surprised when they turned out to 
be highly negative. It was a commercial enterprise, and these do not pay off by 
producing enlightening discussion but by producing clashes between 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
I vividly recall my first meeting with the British media magnate, Sir James 
Goldsmith, who visited me while I was taping one of the programs. He was a 
strong supporter and was shocked by what he considered to be the vicious 
anti-Nixon bias of Frost's top researchers, James Reston Jr. and Bob Zelnick, 
now Pentagon correspondent for ABC News. I knew he was right, and the choice of 
topics, the slant in the questions and the editing of the final broadcasts 
reflected the bias. At the time, however, I had no choice in such matters. 
</P>
<P>
THE WHITE HOUSE, AUG. 9, 1974 
</P>
<P>
I did not sleep well my last night in the White House. This was not unusual; 
after a major speech or press conference I get so keyed up I always find it 
difficult to get to sleep. That evening, in a nationwide address, I had 
announced my decision to resign the Presidency. It was 2 a.m. before I dozed 
off. 
</P>
<P>
I woke up with a start. I looked at my watch; it was only 4 a.m. I went across 
the west hall to the kitchen to get a glass of milk. I was startled to see 
Johnny Johnson, one of the stewards, making coffee. 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Johnny, what are you doing here so early?" 
</P>
<P>
He replied, "It isn't early, Mr. President. It's almost 6 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
My watch had stopped. After three years the battery had run down. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Johnny to make me some corned beef hash with a poached egg rather than 
the usual Spartan breakfast of wheat germ, orange juice and a glass of milk. I 
showered and shaved and walked down to the Lincoln Sitting Room. It is the 
smallest room in the White House and my favorite. I sat down in my favorite 
chair and put my feet up on the ottoman. Pat had given the chair to me as a 
birthday present when we were living in California in 1962. We had taken it 
with us first to our apartment in New York and then to the White House. It is 
the chair in which I am sitting as I dictate this recollection. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to make some notes for what would be my last speech as President. I had 
spoken to tens of millions the night before on television. Now I had to think 
of something personal to say to a few dozen members of my White House staff -- 
dedicated men and women who had served so loyally during the tumultuous days of 
the Vietnam War and the even more difficult days of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Painful for Them' 
</P>
<P>
The day before I had found it difficult to control my emotions in a meeting in 
the Cabinet Room with my closest friends and supporters in Congress. I 
concluded by blurting out what I knew was true: "I just hope that I haven't let 
you down." Today, I had to find a way to lift up the loyal members of my staff. 
I knew I should not talk about Pat, Tricia, Julie, Ed Cox and David Eisenhower, 
who would all be standing by my side on the platform. It would be too painful 
for them and for me. 
</P>
<P>
The family had unanimously opposed my decision to resign. Tricia, whose quiet 
strength reminded me of my mother, fiercely insisted to the very last that I 
not even consider resigning. Two days before, I had worked on my resignation 
speech until 2 a.m. in the Lincoln Sitting Room. When I went to my bedroom to 
catch a couple hours' sleep, I found a note from Julie on my pillow: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Daddy, 
</P>
<P>
 I love you. Whatever you do I will support. I am very proud of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Please wait a week or even 10 days before you make this decision. Go through 
the fire just a little bit longer. You are so strong! I love you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julie 
</P>
<P>
 Millions support you. 
</P>
<P>
If anything could have changed my mind, Julie's note would have done it. But I 
was too worn out to reconsider. It was not because I had given up the fight but 
because I knew that the decision I had made was best for the country. Two years 
of Watergate was enough. The nation could not stand the trauma of a President 
on trial before the Senate for months. The international situation required a 
full-time President. 
</P>
<P>
Once my family knew that the decision was final, they backed it. Pat took on 
the superhuman task of supervising the packing of all the belongings we had 
acquired during the past 5 1/2 years in the White House. She had not slept for 
48 hours. I don't know how she did it. The way she stood on the platform by my 
side, erect and proud though her heart was breaking, demonstrated what I had 
always said -- that she is the strongest member of my family, personal or 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I decided to talk to the staff about my roots. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke of my father and my mother. I read the moving tribute Theodore 
Roosevelt had written when his first wife died: "She was beautiful in face and 
form and lovelier still in spirit. When she had just become a mother, when her 
life seemed to be just begun and the years seemed so bright before her, and 
then by a strange and terrible fate death came to her. And when my heart's 
dearest died, the light went from my life forever." T.R. had written those 
words when he was in his 20s. He thought the light had gone out of his life 
forever. But he went on to become President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
I went on, "We think sometimes when things don't go the right way, when we 
suffer a defeat, that all has ended. Not true. It is only a beginning, always. 
Greatness comes not when things always go good for you, but the greatness comes 
when you are really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, 
when sadness comes. Because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you 
ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"Always give your best. Never get discouraged, never be petty. Always remember, 
others may hate you, but those that hate you don't win unless you hate them, 
and then you destroy yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The critics panned my remarks, not surprisingly, as being too emotional. They 
overlooked the fact that it was an emotional moment. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was all over. We said goodby to the Fords and were on our way back 
home to California, where we thought, mistakenly, we would at long last find 
peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Will Harass and Hound You' 
</P>
<P>
The following day, the blows began to fall again. The special prosecutor, Leon 
Jaworski, had been delighted when Al (Alexander M.)Haig (Jr.) informed him of 
my decision to resign. He thought it would be in the best interest of the 
country. Haig reported to me that, based on his conversation, he did not 
believe we would continue to suffer harassment by the special prosecutor. He 
had not reckoned with the young activists on Jaworski's staff. Far from being 
satisfied by the resignation, their appetites for finishing the injured victim 
were whetted. 
</P>
<P>
When Ed Cox urged me not to resign, he had warned me that this might happen. He 
had known several of Jaworski's staff at the Harvard Law School and had served 
with some in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York. He said, "I know these 
people. They are smart and ruthless. They hate you. They will harass you and 
hound you in civil and criminal action across the country for the rest of your 
life." He was right. 
</P>
<P>
One after another, the blows rained down. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of lawsuits were filed against me by individuals who were seeking 
damages for assorted government actions. Few involved presidential decision. 
Most were dismissed, but all had to be defended. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for attorneys' fees was staggering. In the 15 years since I resigned 
the presidency, I have spent more than $1.8 million in attorneys' fees to 
defend myself against such suits and to protect my rights that were threatened 
by government action. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled against me on my suits to gain possession of my papers 
and tapes, including those that were private. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Were Obvious Forgeries' 
</P>
<P>
A scandal magazine printed letters that I was supposed to have written to a 
countess in Spain whom I had never met. They were obvious forgeries, but the 
story was never retracted. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst blows was the harassment of my friends. Bebe Rebozo was 
accused of being associated with the Mafia, gamblers and drug barons. The 
special prosecutor's staff pursued him for more than a year. He testified 85 
times before the prosecutor's staff and the Ervin Committee. All of the charges 
were false. He had done nothing wrong, except to be my friend. In the end, he 
was cleared. His attorneys' fees were enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Stans, a scrupulously honest man, paid fines for five technical 
non-intentional misdemeanor violations of the campaign laws -- the moral 
equivalent of parking tickets. Similar violations by Democratic fund-raisers 
were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
By far the hardest blow was the pardon. My primary reason for resigning was to 
avoid having a President of the United States in the dock for alleged illegal 
activities. But the assaults had not stopped. As President, even after I had 
been crippled by Watergate, I could still set the agenda to an extent. My 
visits to the Soviet Union and the Mideast that summer had resulted in some 
significant diplomatic achievements. But now, without the powers of the office, 
I was utterly defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
My public standing had been driven so low that I do not think there was any 
allegation about me, no matter how horrendous or base, that would not have been 
believed if it was aired or published. In fact many distortions and blatant 
lies about me, my family and my friends were aired and published. It was not 
enough for my critics to say that I had made terrible mistakes. They seemed 
driven to prove that I represented the epitome of evil itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Pardon 
</P>
<P>
I will never forget the moment that Jack Miller, my attorney from Washington, 
came into my office in San Clemente on Sept. 4 to inform me of President Ford's 
decision to stop the hemorrhaging by issuing a presidential pardon. Now I had 
to decide whether or not to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
We discussed it at great length. I told Miller I was worried the pardon would 
hurt Ford politically. He said that in the short run, it would. But he added 
that if the country continued to be obsessed by Watergate, President Ford and 
others in government would suffer even more from being unable to devote their 
attention to urgent problems at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also knew my desperate financial situation. He pointed out that the 
attorneys' fees and the other costs of defending actions against me would 
bankrupt me. In view of what happened soon thereafter, he was remarkably 
perceptive when he added that he thought that I had taken as much physically, 
mentally and emotionally as I could and that I should accept the pardon for my 
own well-being and my family's as well. His strongest argument was that because 
of the unprecedented publicity over the past year and a half, there was no way 
I could get a fair trial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the resignation, accepting the pardon was the most painful decision of 
my political career. The statement I issued at the time accurately describes my 
feelings then and now: 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing 
with Watergate, particularly when it reached the state of judicial proceedings 
and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy. 
</P>

PREPARING FOR THE WORST, HONG KONG EXPECTS BEST; 
</P>
<P>
ASIA: WITH THE SPECTER OF A CHINESE TAKEOVER LOOMING IN 1997, THE CROWN 
COLONY'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS STILL BUSTLING.

West. He recently returned from Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
As Marxism collapses in Europe, Hong Kong is replacing Berlin as the new front 
for democracy and the free market. The nearly 6 million residents of the 
bustling British Crown Colony, scheduled to come under Chinese rule in 1997, 
are watching anxiously for signs that the Communist regime in Beijing, like its 
counterparts elsewhere, will reform itself or collapse entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Not that everyone is waiting around for the withering away of the Marxist 
state. Even before the brutal suppression of the democracy movement in China 
last spring, growing numbers of Hong Kong residents were embarking for safer 
havens. Since 1986, emigration has increased from 20,000 annually to more than 
45,000 last year, with estimates running as high as 60,000 for this year. 
</P>
<P>
Capital, too, has been fleeing for more secure quarters. Billions of Hong Kong 
dollars now reside in Britain, North America and other parts of Asia. Recent 
pronouncements by Beijing concerning the post-1997 Basic Law -- essentially 
quashing hopes for full democratic self-rule in the Hong Kong before well into 
the next century -- have driven poll ratings of public confidence lower than 
even immediately following last June's Tian An Men Square massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Yet amid all the gloom, Hong Kong is simultaneously preparing for a future as 
Asia's premier business center. Despite 1989's slow 2.5% rate of growth -- 
compared to 14% as recently as 1987 -- and a somewhat shaky property market, 
new office towers are going up or being planned throughout the city's central 
districts. Public investment is also increasing, with plans proceeding for a 
new $16-billion airport, a multibillion-dollar expansion of the city's 
container port, already the world's busiest, and a new 7,000-student University 
of Science and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese here are the cleverest people in the world," said one senior 
British official. "They keep a foot planted firmly in both camps, one here and 
another in the United States or Canada." 
</P>
<P>
This spirit of opportunistic ambivalence is particularly evident among the 
recent emigrants. After gaining an alternative passport, many have returned to 
Hong Kong to stay close to family or simply to make money. Such returnees, for 
example, could account for as many as 26,000 of the estimated 35,000 Canadian 
residents of Hong Kong. Even the individual hired by the British administration 
to compile the out-migration statistics, was "the perfect Hong Kong man" -- 
born in China, educated in Hong Kong, a citizen of New Zealand and now a 
permanent resident of the Crown Colony. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just Chinese who are remaining in Hong Kong. While the pace of 
U.S. and European investment has slowed somewhat, Japanese corporations have 
been taking up much of the slack. In 1988, Japan surpassed the United States to 
become the leader in new investments, pouring in more than $1.6 billion, 
including purchases of key real estate, manufacturing plants and retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Like their Chinese counterparts, the Japanese and other foreigners are staying 
with Hong Kong out of a conviction that the city's long-term assets outweigh 
its current predicament. In fact one major Japanese retail conglomerate, 
Yaohan, recently moved its world headquarters from the home islands to Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Yuji Sakuma, Yaohan's managing director, maintains the city and surrounding 
southern China possess a growth potential unmatched in Asia, if not the world. 
"We looked all over for our move," Sakuma explained at his headquarters in 
suburban Sha Tin. "We thought of Singapore, Hawaii or America, but only Hong 
Kong has such good access to the huge market of China." 
</P>
<P>
Sakuma's optimism is based not only in the tremendous building activity 
throughout Hong Kong, but in the related massive development of the adjacent 
Guangdong Province. Already more than two million Chinese in the province work 
for Hong Kong-based companies, which account for roughly 70% of all investment 
in China. By tapping into China's massive labor base, Hong Kong's sophisticated 
business Establishment transformed the Pearl River delta between the Crown 
colony and Canton into one of the world's fastest growing economic regions 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Another critical advantage for Hong Kong -- particularly in contrast to such 
Asian capitals as Seoul or even Tokyo -- lies in its multi-ethnicity. Although 
the vast majority of the population is Chinese, significant American, British, 
Muslim and Indian communities play important roles in the local business scene, 
giving the city an unparalleled edge as an international trading center. 
</P>
<P>
The city's 18,000 Asian-Indian community, active in the Hong Kong since its 
origins in the 1840s, now handles close to 10% of the city's $73 billion 
export-trade business. "Indians have counterparts and networks around the world 
that are different than those of the Chinese," said K. Sital, chairman of the 
Council of Hong Kong Indian Assns. "In places like east and west Africa, we are 
the ones who develop the markets for Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's political control, Sital fears, could imperil the future of his and 
other non-Chinese economic communities. For Beijing has made it clear that 
Asian-Indians -- particularly the estimated 6,000 carrying Hong Kong passports 
-- could well be considered stateless outsiders after 1997. Only people of 
Chinese descent will be considered legitimate Hong Kong citizens, threatening 
the existence of a 150-year record of maintaining a multiracial society. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd probably be just as happy to see the whole Indian community go," said 
one top British official who has been negotiating with the Chinese. "When it 
comes down to it, they're quite racist." 
</P>
<P>
Besides destroying Hong Kong's multiracial culture, many also fear Beijing will 
impose strict controls on the free flow of information, long a mainstay of the 
city's large financial and communications industries. One commonly discussed 
future scenario, for example, foresees China employing a "Singapore solution" 
in post-1997 Hong Kong. Modeled on the approach taken by the authoritarian 
leaders of that island nation to the south, this option sees China keeping Hong 
Kong open to foreign investment and local capitalists while political 
activities and the media remain under strict controls. 
</P>
<P>
But most fear that even such a relatively benign solution could undermine much 
of Hong Kong's attractiveness as a financial and media center. At the same 
time, many top Hong Kong executives expect they will never have to confront 
this scenario. With the current leadership already in its dotage, they predict 
the likely gradual ascent of more reformist leaders -- perhaps even a Chinese 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Another increasingly popular thesis sees the Chinese state itself at the brink 
of Balkanization, with a gradual erosion of the central authority in Beijing. 
Some already see the governor of neighboring Guangdong Province -- Ye Xuan 
Ping, son of the famous Communist general, Marshall Ye -- as the forerunner of 
what Ambrose Yeo-chi King, vice chancellor and professor of sociology at the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong, calls "economic warlordism." 
</P>
<P>
Already, King and others observe, the Guangdong government seems virtually 
independent of Beijing's control on most business-related matters. "The leaders 
in Canton have little respect for the central leaders," explained one Chinese 
businessman with extensive contacts with the Guangdong officials. "As they say, 
'Beijing issues the regulations, but we interpret them.' "

COMMUNISM: FORTY-FIVE YEARS LATER, GADEBUSCH HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF ITS INHERITED 
VALUES, ITS PEOPLE SHAMEFUL OF AND ANGRY AT '40 LOST YEARS.'

<TEXT>
<P>
I still remember my grandmother standing in the doorway of her cottage in the 
early summer of 1945. She was waving goodby as I pedaled my bicycle toward the 
highway that would take me to Hamburg 92 kilometers away. I never saw her 
again. A couple of days later, Russian occupation troops replaced the British 
in an exchange of real estate agreed upon by the wartime allies. Gadebusch in 
Mecklenburg had disappeared behind the Iron Curtain. My grandmother died in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five years later, I went back. Everybody, I suppose, has experienced the 
clash of childhood memories and reality: the rushing river that turns out to be 
a trickling stream, the magic garden that is nothing more than an ordinary 
cabbage patch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, my heart jumped when I saw the railroad station in the woods, with its 
half-timbered station house. As if ordered for me, a diesel train pulled in. 
Although it was not the steam locomotive of my youth, I could easily imagine 
myself getting off the train with my mother, sister and a big suitcase on the 
first day of summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the station, at the edge of the forest, was a crude obelisk topped 
with a star. The inscription: "Glory and honor to the heroes of the Soviet 
Army." No doubt there had been Soviet heroes in the "Great Patriotic War." But 
in Gadebusch? The Americans had liberated the town, then were replaced by 
British troops. When the Russians arrived, hostilities had long since stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The medieval church and city hall were still there. The iron railing on the 
stairs leading from the church to the marketplace was even intact. As kids, we 
used to slide down it. 
</P>
<P>
I turned into Schulstrasse, where my uncle had lived. I remembered the blooming 
geraniums in the front windows of the houses and the tilted mirrors, called 
"spies," that allowed the old ladies to observe the goings-on up and down the 
street. A cobblestoned alley had completed the picture of small-town coziness. 
</P>
<P>
On my visit, half the houses were deserted, their windows broken, walls 
crumbled and roofs caved in. A bronze plaque on one of the houses -- in my 
youth, it contained a pub -- proclaimed that the local Communist Party had been 
founded there in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
My uncle's place, once full of life and activity, was a skeleton. Its walls 
were falling down, its window frames rotting. I looked into the back yard, 
where I remembered water running from a well and chickens, ducks and geese 
picking the ground for food. Nothing but a dusty courtyard with collapsing 
stables. Not a soul in sight. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. The beautiful lake, where lovers used to row and kids used to 
splash, was a muddy pool of water. The manor at the outskirts of town was gone, 
the only evidence of the once stately approach to the main house a few old 
trees. Next door, a sewage treatment plant was in full operation. 
</P>
<P>
The road by my grandparents' house, once a thoroughfare for horse and buggy and 
herded cows, was a one-way street. An East German Trabis puffed along, brushing 
the grimy houses with clouds of blue exhaust. Never again would people sit in 
front of their houses exchanging gossip across this street. In my grandma's 
garden was a new building with a communications tower. Until recently, it had 
housed the state security police (Stasi). All that oppressive might to keep a 
few thousand people in check. It was depressing. 
</P>
<P>
I looked up a cousin. As we talked, she repeatedly cried. She told me about 
collectivization in the 1950s. She and others had been hounded for refusing to 
join the cooperative. They had been denounced on billboards for "withholding 
bread from the workers" when the cooperative didn't make its quota. Finally, 
she and her husband, mentally and physically exhausted, relented. Her husband 
died a broken man. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of communist rule have stripped Gadebusch of its inherited values. 
The middle class of hard-working farmers and skilled craftsmen, who took great 
pride in their trades, their houses and their town, has been smashed or driven 
out. The bourgeoisie, as greedy and petty as it may have been, had built 
Gadebusch, kept it neat and orderly and lively for generations. The communists, 
unable to create a classless society, only managed to destroy what had been. 
</P>
<P>
Punished for taking care of and having pride in their property, the people are 
now disoriented and suspicious. Accustomed to the public celebration of lies 
and 
</P>
<P>
the torment of humiliation, the people have fled into niches of privacy, 
alienated from the commonweal. The shame of and anger at "40 lost years" are 
barely hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of saying in public what they knew to be false, of worrying about 
the trustworthiness of neighbors and friends, of ostentatious flag-waving and 
sloganeering. And presiding over it all had been those stern prophets of 
equality who had filled their pockets with the silver of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of the Iron Curtain and the promise of unification with the West have 
not made the people more confident. What is going to happen to my hard-earned 
savings? they ask. Am I going to lose my job? Will I be able to compete with 
Western workers? Will the owner of the house I am living in throw me out or 
increase the rent? 
</P>
<P>
When East Germans voted last month, it was not the self-confident act of 
victorious revolutionaries. It was a plea for help, help from from their 
countrymen in the West.

AFRICA STRUGGLES TO FEED ITSELF, FIGHTING INTRACTABLE FOES; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: BESET BY DISEASE AND INFESTATION, THE CONTINENT HAS HAD NO 'GREEN 
REVOLUTION.' IT FIGHTS TO PRESERVE A FRAGILE FOOD CHAIN WHILE POPULATION SOARS.

<P>
There is a valley here that demonstrates why there has been no green revolution 
in Africa. It lies just north of the city, past the last village on the rutted 
track through the red soil, luxuriant with the dense foliage of the plants that 
feed and sustain the growing population. But around the second bend in the 
road, there is an ugly scar: Leaves of the plantain trees have been seared, as 
if by a giant blow torch, victims of the dreaded black sigatoka. 
</P>
<P>
The fungus disease was brought accidentally to Central Africa from Latin 
America, and in 17 years it has spread ruin over millions of acres, finally 
reaching this remote valley 2,000 miles from where this plague started. About 
60 million people in Africa depend on plantains for at least a quarter of their 
carbohydrates. Today, the disease represents the newest challenge to plant 
scientists struggling to preserve the fragile African food supply. An 
innovative solution is at hand, but it will not attract the same global 
attention as the high-yield dwarf varieties of rice, wheat and corn of Asia's 
green revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason there is no green revolution in Africa is that so much of our 
research has to be directed to resistance-breeding and developing ways to 
protect the gains we have made," said Laurence D. Stifel, director general of 
the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture here. The IITA is one of 
13 international research facilities around the world that are at the very 
center of efforts to assure the survival of three-fourths of the world's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
These are the institutions best known for the grains that have helped food 
supplies keep up with population growth. Norman Borlaug won the 1970 Nobel 
Peace Prize for his work in Mexico on some of those developments. The research 
centers have played an equally decisive role in Africa, but without such 
spectacular achievements. Here the struggle is a rear-guard defense against 
plant disease and infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Stifel to identify the greatest achievement at the IITA, and his answer is 
a surprise. There are many achievements to talk about: high-yield, 
pest-resistant varieties of cassava; improved varieties of cowpeas that bring 
nitrogen to the soil and protein to the diet even in drought-prone areas, and 
minimum-tillage farming techniques that improve productivity while reducing 
weeds. And dozens more -- all important achievements. But the project that 
Stifel talks most about is defense against the mealybug that was threatening 
destruction of Africa's cassava, the basic food of millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
A disaster of incalculable dimensions was in the making as the voracious 
mealybug attacked the cassava. African farmers have no money for chemical 
pesticides. IITA scientists knew there could be only one solution -- a natural 
predator. They found it after a search over thousands of miles of remote areas 
of Latin America, the land where cassava first was grown. A parasitic wasp. A 
rapid-breeding program was instituted and millions of the insects were 
released, from airplanes in remote areas, from ground parties in accessible 
areas. "Villages step back from hunger not even understanding why the 
destructive mealybugs have disappeared," Stifel reported. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of Africa are so intractable that researchers, armed with the most 
advanced science and technology, have been frustrated over and over again. No 
where is that better illustrated than in the search for a way to expand 
livestock production. Animals are needed not just for the protein, but also for 
hides, for the manure that can be used as fuel and fertilizer and to pull plows 
and wagons in a region with only a few tractors. Much of the grasslands can be 
put to use only as feed for cattle. But vast areas of East and Central Africa 
are infested with ticks and tsetse flies that carry theileriosis and 
trypanosomiasis, that waste and often kill the herds. 
</P>
<P>
There were great expectations, a decade ago, that a vaccine could be developed 
to protect the livestock. Development of a vaccine remains the priority at 
another of the great international centers, the International Laboratory for 
Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) on the outskirts of Nairobi in Kenya. But 
vaccines have proven incredibly elusive. 
</P>
<P>
In the process of seeking vaccines, however, the scientists at ILRAD have made 
other advances of great consequence. From 10 years of work has emerged the 
first clear understanding of how the bovine immune system functions. "This new 
knowledge of bovine immunology opens the way to new research globally, an 
enormous contribution even to American farmers," according to Jack Doyle, the 
Scotsman who is ILRAD director of research. 
</P>
<P>
As the pursuit of vaccines continues, ILRAD has also moved ahead on another 
course, breeding cattle tolerant of trypanosomiasis. Scientists had worked a 
dozen years without much success using the cattle common is East Africa, the 
hump-backed Zebu, that were brought here around 2000 BC from Asia, by way of 
Egypt. Now they are making extraordinary progress using the Ndama cattle from 
West Africa, progeny of animals driven from the Middle East by way of Spain at 
least 7,000 years ago -- cattle that are cousins to the longhorns that were 
carried to the American Southwest. Those prehistoric cattle runs have been 
traced and dated through ancient cave drawings. Unlike the Zebu, the Ndama is 
disease tolerant. But the animal still faces another kind of resistance: 
Farmers dislike its relatively small stature and reduced milk capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 international agricultural research centers, including IITA here and 
ILRAD in Nairobi, are independent, individually funded by governments, 
foundations and international agencies. They are loosely coordinated through 
what is called the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, 
based at the World Bank in Washington. The bank itself has proven the guardian 
angel of the program, expanding its contribution when other donors have lagged. 
The last pledging conference in November produced $240 million, representing an 
increase hardly equal to the rate of inflation, $35 million short of the 
budgets proposed by the centers. That has forced postponement for at least a 
year of expansion plans, including urgently needed new programs in vegetables 
and tropical forestry. Delays of that sort prolong the malnutrition that stalks 
so much of the developing southern hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the obstacles to progress are political. Donor governments in the West 
are cutting back on their investment in agricultural research at the very 
moment that the need is most urgent. American farmers continue to try to thwart 
any crop-development program perceived to create potential competition for U.S. 
exports. So it is that tropical soybean development, essential to addressing 
the protein deficiencies prevalent in all of Africa, was constrained by edicts 
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture mandated by Congress to protect the 
soybean farmers of the Middle West. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to progress is the weakness in extension services to deliver 
new technologies to the farmers. But it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Kwasi MacZormelo, 31, single, with three years of post-high school technical 
training, is one of the new generation of high-technology farmers of West 
Africa. But high technology is a relative term. "Chemical weed control is too 
costly, so I use my own strength," he explained, as one of his co-workers 
applied a short-handled hoe to the field behind him. He farms four acres near 
Kumasi, Ghana. Small, intensely tilled farms have been proved best in these 
tropical areas. He harvests two crops of cowpeas, one of corn and is 
introducing one of Africa's newest techniques, planting leucaena trees between 
crop rows. The fast-growing tree enriches the soil and reduces weeds with the 
shade of its leaves, which also serve as mulch, and its branches are useful for 
firewood, always in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
The new plant varieties and growing technologies being used by MacZormelo have 
their origins in the international agricultural centers. In this case, the 
research began at both the International Center for the Improvement of Corn and 
Wheat in El Batan, Mexico, and IITA in Ibadan. Roberto Arias, a Savadoran 
agronomist, represents the El Batan center in Ghana, coordinating its research 
with the Ghana Grains Development Project sponsored by the government of 
Canada, and Ghana's national institutions, including the Crop Research 
Institute in Kumasi. "We are trying to develop a methodology so that research 
and extension services are complementary," Arias said. 
</P>
<P>
This tenuous network for delivering new varieties and new technologies will be 
crucial in resolving the black sigatoka infestation affecting plantain trees. 
That is because the only realistic solution is to develop new varieties of 
plantains that are resistant or tolerant to black sigatoka, and then distribute 
the new plants to the vast areas impacted by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The IITA is nearing completion of plant development -- five resistant varieties 
have been identified from a collection of more than 200 different varieties, 
but now they must be field tested to see if the fruit is acceptable. At the 
same time, a dozen other varieties have been crossed with disease-resistant 
stock to produce hybrids now being field-tested. 
</P>
<P>
It is painstaking, tedious work, unspectacular, but just as important as the 
green revolution in the struggle to feed a global population that grows by 
250,000 people a day, and to try to meet the basic needs of the 280 million 
Africans who live in absolute poverty.

BUSH SETS THE MORE CIVIL TONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cynic might argue that the Bush Administration is trying to play "good 
cop-bad cop" on civil rights. We prefer to believe that his own government's 
obvious confusion on the question is one of the reasons the President has 
chosen this moment to mount his bully pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Wednesday, Bush praised Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and said the 
Administration would "live up to the highest ideals of the civil-rights 
movement." To that end, he pledged "to fight against poverty and for 
opportunity." These are welcome sentiments, well-expressed. 
</P>
<P>
Almost simultaneously, however, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he would 
recommend that the President veto this year's most important piece of 
civil-rights legislation. That bill, which was approved by the Senate Labor and 
Human Resources Committee on Wednesday, would overturn a series of recent U.S. 
Supreme Court decisions that have undermined the foundations of the federal 
government's long effort to root out job discrimination. Thornburgh said he 
opposed the measure because it would "encourage quota systems (and) divide our 
society along racial lines." This ideological obsession with fictional quotas 
masquerading as "colorblindness" was one of the hallmarks of the Reagan 
Administration's mean-spirited approach to civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh does not even apply it with consistency. One of the court decisions 
he defends as "colorblind" -- Price-Waterhouse vs. Hopkins -- in fact allows 
employers to consider race and sex as a "factor" in awarding promotions so long 
as that factor is not the decisive one. Another of the cases -- Martin vs. 
Wilkes -- virtually guarantees a deepening of racial divisions by reopening 
hundreds of current city and county affirmative-action plans to court 
challenges by white males who feel that they have been discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration needs to speak with one voice on these critical 
questions -- and that voice ought to be the President's.

Where do I hide from the death penalty? What about the children? What do they 
learn when 4 out of 5 adults believe ("Voters Favor Execution by Nearly 4 to 
1," front page, April 2) society should be a cold-blooded killer? Opinion 
doesn't make it right.

ONE LINCOLN THAT'S NO MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln Boulevard is practically a paradigm for what troubles Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
This is the major thoroughfare that runs through the city of Los Angeles' 
Westchester community, the county's Marina del Rey and north into Santa Monica. 
The street also borders Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Boulevard is a living, if gridlocked, example of why the notion of 
regional government must move out of the realm of civics lectures and into the 
real world where Southern Californians are choking from environmental problems 
that do not respect municipal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Along a four-mile stretch of the Lincoln corridor, various developers and local 
governments are currently proposing to add office space equal to nearly half 
that in downtown Los Angeles, enough retail space to house four Westside 
Pavilion malls and more housing units than in all Hermosa Beach. Just picture 
it. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the matter, of course, is money, and the potential tax revenue 
that one locality can hope to gain by allowing construction of a huge 
commercial or residential development. Of course, the traffic, air quality or 
sewer demands caused by a particular development spill over into surrounding 
communities as well. That's the unhealthy fallout. 
</P>
<P>
No local government is blameless in this kill-or-be-killed game, a game fueled 
by the increasingly cutthroat competition for tax dollars. When city and county 
governments know they cannot count on sufficient state and federal help to 
provide government services, the "I've-got-mine" mentality translates into the 
kind of runaway development proposed for the Lincoln corridor. 
</P>
<P>
That is why so many urban planners who are thinking beyond neighborhood 
boundaries recommend regional government for the "big picture" items like 
transportation, air quality and water. The regional government bill introduced 
last month by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other efforts like it deserve 
serious and thoughtful discussion by concerned citizens as well as by 
lawmakers. Our lungs, idling cars and water faucets really don't care whether 
they're choking in Marina del Rey or Culver City.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush recently made a most welcome commitment to passage of 
legislation barring discrimination against those infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law already is in place guarding against discrimination in housing -- 
but not in employment. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of just that kind of discrimination discourages many from seeking the 
appropriate tests for the infection. This is a source of great frustration to 
public-health officials in their efforts to trace the epidemiology of the 
disease and improve programs of control and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who are living with HIV and AIDS, our response is clear," the 
President told the National Business Leadership Conference on AIDS. "They 
deserve our compassion. They deserve our care. And they deserve more than a 
chance -- they deserve a cure." 
</P>
<P>
His endorsement of the Americans With Disabilities Act, already passed by the 
Senate, should facilitate quick passage. His commitment to the fight against 
discrimination would have been stronger, however, had he also spoken against 
the legislation now in effect that requires foreigners with AIDS to obtain a 
waiver to visit the United States. This is an unnecessary and discriminatory 
measure, serving no substantial public-health purpose. Not surprisingly, it is 
the object of a worldwide protest, now taking the form of a threatened boycott 
of the international AIDS conference scheduled for San Francisco in June. 
</P>
<P>
Another notable omission from the President's address was a commitment of more 
money. This drew criticism from Robert D. Haas, president and chief executive 
of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. "Even if the private sector helps create 'a thousand 
points of light' across the land," Haas commented, "it will be of no avail if 
there is darkness in the White House." It's hard to put it any better than 
that.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS STAY OF EXECUTION FOR HARRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time to repeal the death penalty -- not because it's unjust or immoral but 
because it's unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Under our system of justice, murderers sentenced to die have become the most 
protected of felons, guaranteed years of review, appeals and delays at public 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Their plight attracts a multitude of apologists and supporters, including those 
opposed to capital punishment under any circumstances. If murderers are members 
of a minority, they can be portrayed as victims of prejudice and their defense 
often becomes a political obligation. If not, their defenders can blame their 
parents, associates or society in general for their antisocial conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Murder is an abnormal act. It's, therefore, not surprising that defense 
attorneys will uncover histories of deviant behavior in their clients' past. If 
this behavior can be traced to physical, mental or emotional impairment, the 
defense can move for exoneration on the grounds that the defendants, through no 
fault of their own, fail to recognize constraints governing the conduct of 
normal people. 
</P>
<P>
According to polls, most of us favor the death penalty and abhor the media 
circus which has made an international celebrity out of a brutal and amoral 
killer like Harris. But we must recognize the limitations of our legal system 
and society that permit only one murderer out of a hundred to be executed. Why 
continue a law with that kind of track record which also inspires widespread 
frustration and cynicism, not to mention the expenditure of millions? 
</P>
<P>
It's time to face up to reality.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS STAY OF EXECUTION FOR HARRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court did the right thing by keeping Robert Alton Harris alive 
until it can be determined whether his rights have been violated (Part A, April 
3). This seems more logical than Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's policy, which is 
to execute the man now and consider his rights later. 
</P>
<P>
No major candidate for statewide office has shown the courage or leadership to 
ignore the public-opinion polls and call for abolition of the death penalty, 
but Van de Kamp came close when he called the practice immoral. That he 
considers it his constitutional duty as attorney general to enforce even 
immoral laws is an arguable point, but when he boasts of packing death row with 
candidates for the gas chamber he begins to sound like a man at war with 
himself. Can anyone who feels strongly about this issue support his 
gubernatorial ambitions with much enthusiasm? 
</P>
<P>
There is a subtle but real difference between California Republicans and 
Democrats today as we consider the return to executions after nearly a quarter 
of a century. Republicans really love the death penalty, as their ancestors 
loved the simple joys of the hunt. Democrats, being more sensitive souls, 
shrink from killing for sport; they take the moral high ground and kill only 
for votes.

<P>
Thank you very much for your editorial. It is hard to believe that so many 
people favor the death penalty in this our so-called civilized society. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-death penalty people sound very much like the mob trying to stone to 
death the adulterous woman in the Gospel, to whom Jesus very wisely said: "Cast 
the first stone those who are without sin." Of course the worst sin is lack of 
love and compassion for others. Obviously, Harris' brain was affected by being 
abused as a child and by the fact that his mother had an alcohol problem. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian should go to Iran where he belongs. There, his thirst 
for revenge will be amply satisfied watching all those people being hanged and 
stoned by the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
Again, we should not kill people who kill people, to show that we should not 
kill people. God gave us life and only God can take it away.

SOCIAL PROBLEMS: THE REPUBLICANS LACK THE WILL TO SOLVE THEM, BUT DEMOCRATS

<TEXT>
<P>
We are living in a time of unprecedented national consensus. The great 
ideological arguments of the past -- over Russia, Vietnam, Nicaragua, the 
welfare state, nuclear deterrence, etc. 
</P>
<P>
-- are over. There are only two real issues on the American agenda. Debt: the 
budget deficit and associated debt problems (e.g., the S&amp;L debacle). And 
race: namely, the social problems (drugs, violence, poor schooling, family 
break-up) of the urban underclass. 
</P>
<P>
On debt, everybody knows what has to be done -- raise taxes and/or cut 
entitlements -- but no one of either party has the courage to do it. On race, 
the opposite is true: Everyone wants to do something but no one has the 
faintest idea what to do. When the two great issues of the day are in a state 
of paralysis, one for lack of will and one for lack of way, it is not 
surprising that both government and opposition appear marginal. 
</P>
<P>
In an era of ideological consensus, the parties naturally find themselves 
engaged in narrow arguments over means. Everybody is for education, child care 
and clean air. In the clean-air bill now being hammered out in Congress, the 
fight is about a little less tailpipe emissions here, a little more high-sulfur 
coal there. Important issues, but hardly galvanizing. 
</P>
<P>
Which explains the attraction of would-be Democratic issues such as 
protectionism, Social Security and demobilization. They all have the potential 
to galvanize. It is therefore a critique of sorts to say that the Democrats as 
a party are not hungry, not ruthless, not irresponsible enough to seize these 
issues as a route to power. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not confuse partisanship with statesmanship. Populism is fun and it 
may be profitable. But it isn't vision.

An early spring storm whipped up winter-like conditions from the plains to the 
East Coast, and record low temperatures extended from Alabama to Kansas. Snow 
was reported over Michigan and in the East from Cape Cod to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 10 inches fell in parts of West Virginia, making driving hazardous. Three 
inches fell in Philadelphia, southern New Jersey and Ohio. Frost and freeze 
warnings were posted over Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee. 
Flurries in Washington, D.C., failed to stop the National Cherry Blossom 
parade. Throngs of tourists and residents attended despite unseasonal cold and 
the absence of cherry blossoms, which last month bloomed early. But Seattle 
marked a 14th straight day without measurable rainfall -- a very unusual 
pattern.

The United States last month secretly proposed a ban on land-based missiles 
with multiple warheads, but Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev replied that 
the plan was too limited, according to a published report. Citing 
Administration sources, the New York Times said in today's editions that 
Gorbachev complained in a letter delivered last week to President Bush by 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that the proposal excluded 
sea-based ballistic missiles, which Moscow has long wanted to cut. 
Administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

MISTER FRISKY HAS WEST ROLLING; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANITA DERBY: HE REMAINS UNBEATEN AND MIGHT BE SOUTHLAND LINK TO ANOTHER 
KENTUCKY DERBY VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the owners of Mister Frisky have turned down several offers for their 
3-year-old colt, both here and in Puerto Rico, he has unofficially been taken 
away from them. 
</P>
<P>
"He is no longer our horse," said Marta Fernandez, who races Mister Frisky with 
her husband, Jose. "He belongs to all of Puerto Rico." 
</P>
<P>
In another way, Mister Frisky also belongs to those in the crowd of 44,837 at 
Santa Anita Saturday who sent him off the 3-5 favorite in the $500,000 Santa 
Anita Derby. He didn't disappoint them, remaining undefeated with a 4 
1/2-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Florida-bred, Puerto Rican-raced and now California-trained by Laz Barrera, 
Mister Frisky won his 16th consecutive race and could give the West Coast a 
link to a fifth consecutive Kentucky Derby winner -- after Ferdinand, Alysheba, 
Winning Colors and Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera's Derby record includes victories with Bold Forbes in 1976 and 
Affirmed, an eventual Triple Crown champion, in 1978. Like Mister Frisky, Bold 
Forbes started his career in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Having beaten the best in the West, Mister Frisky must contend with the Eastern 
standouts, led by Summer Squall -- who has lost only once. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will have a good shot," said Barrera, who received Mister Frisky 
from the Fernandezes after he won 13 races in Puerto Rico. "I like my position. 
Summer Squall? They are rushing him too much. They have had to be too pushy 
with him. After this race, I don't have to rush. Now everybody back there has 
to worry about who can beat Mister Frisky." 
</P>
<P>
Out of action for 6 1/2 months because of broken leg, Summer Squall's final 
Derby prep will be at Keeneland next Saturday in the Blue Grass, which will be 
the colt's third start in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky has equaled Citation's 16-race winning streak, which came in the 
1948 and 1950 seasons, with a year off in between because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, a $15,000 purchase by Jose Fernandez at a 2-year-old auction as 
a gift for his wife on their 21st wedding anniversary, has handled every 
question with a positive answer. 
</P>
<P>
"When he won going five-eighths (of a mile), they wondered whether he'd go six 
furlongs," Barrera said. "Six furlongs, they asked about seven furlongs. Seven 
furlongs, they said he might not make a mile. A mile, they wondered about a 
mile and an eighth (Saturday's distance). And I think he can get a mile and a 
quarter (the Kentucky Derby distance)." 
</P>
<P>
Under Gary Stevens, Mister Frisky earned $275,000 in the Santa Anita Derby -- 
slightly more than his purse total for all 15 previous races. The winning time 
was 1:49, two seconds slower than the stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
Video Ranger, a $40,000 purchase out of the maiden claiming ranks in January, 
finished second at 36-1, the biggest price on the board. Video Ranger beat 
Warcraft by a half-length. The trainers of both horses indicated that the 
Kentucky Derby was a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Real Cash, the second betting choice at 3-1, couldn't hold off Mister Frisky 
leaving the far turn and, despite running fourth, 6 3/4 lengths behind the 
winner, probably will run another race before his Derby fate is determined. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, who had won the San Vicente and San Rafael at Santa Anita, paid 
$3.20, $3 and $2.60. Video Ranger paid $11.20 and $4.80 and Warcraft $3. 
</P>
<P>
In the walking ring before the race, Mister Frisky became excited by the crowd, 
and he swung around, leaving the horse path and sending photographers, owners 
of other horses and paddock visitors scurrying on the inside part of the ring. 
It took handlers on both sides to get him to the track. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice horse around the barn, but when he comes to the track, he wants to 
fight," Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking inside of Warcraft, who drew the outside, Mister Frisky was able to 
move toward the rail in the run to the first turn, and by that time he and 
Stevens were close behind Real Cash and Angel Cordero, who had taken the lead 
from the No. 1 post. 
</P>
<P>
All Barrera told Stevens before the race was not to let Real Cash get too far 
ahead of Mister Frisky. Down the backstretch, Mister Frisky was never more than 
a length or two behind, Real Cash setting a moderate pace. Music Prospector was 
third, on the inside, but the horse in better position appeared to be Warcraft, 
who was a close, threatening fourth. 
</P>
<P>
On the far turn, Mister Frisky ranged to within a half-length of Real Cash, 
then slipped back to a length off the lead. At the five-sixteenths pole, Mister 
Frisky pulled to the lead. Cordero knew he was in trouble and whacked Real Cash 
six times on the right flank. That didn't help, as Mister Frisky went past and 
widened his lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens hit Mister Frisky with his whip just once, at the top of the stretch. 
"This horse is very intelligent and is getting smarter all the time," said 
Stevens, who scored a Santa Anita-Kentucky Derby double with the filly Winning 
Colors in 1988. "At the quarter pole, he automatically accelerates now. He 
knows that pole." 
</P>
<P>
Video Ranger, who trailed by 12 lengths early, passed the others but was never 
dangerous. Warcraft was unable to put in a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
"At the quarter pole, I knew I was riding for second money, and I couldn't even 
hang on for that," said Chris McCarron, Warcraft's jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who had won the Santa Anita Derby with Temperate 
Sil in 1987 and Sunday Silence last year, was running Warcraft for the sixth 
time in about nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to catch up," Whittingham said. "My horse ran a good race, but 
he hung. I think it's still a wide-open year. The bubble is bursting (for other 
horses) all over the country, but this (Mister Frisky) is one bubble who's 
staying alive." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how good Mister Frisky was, Whittingham said: "He just keeps winning, 
doesn't he?" 
</P>

Laz Barrera said that Mister Frisky would be flown to Kentucky next Saturday. . 
. . Barrera said he considered it an omen when he heard that Mr. Frisk, an 
11-year-old gelding, had won the Grand National Steeplechase in England earlier 
in the day. . . . Affirmed also won the Santa Anita Derby for Barrera. "I can't 
compare Mister Frisky with Bold Forbes and Affirmed, because it's difficult to 
compare horses," Barrera said. "Affirmed was quiet and relaxed. Mister Frisky 
is smart, the way Affirmed was." . . . Video Ranger might run in the California 
Derby at Golden Gate Fields April 21, according to trainer Ian Jory. . . . 
Mister Frisky was not nominated to the Breeders' Cup and would have to be 
supplemented to the $3 million Classic at Belmont Park this fall at a cost of 
$360,000.

JIM MURRAY: THIS COLT COULD BE THE NEXT MAN O' WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, boy! Ole! Wow! 
</P>
<P>
Have I got a horse for you! 
</P>
<P>
Look, I wasn't around to see Man o' War. Count Fleet. Seabiscuit. Twenty Grand. 
Equipoise. 
</P>
<P>
But I saw Swaps. Affirmed. Sunday Silence. Citation. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday I saw Mister Frisky. If this isn't a horse for the ages, you could 
fool me. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you never can be sure about a 3-year-old horse. They are like 
teen-agers. You never can be sure whether they're going to run a bank -- or rob 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But this gorgeous burnished copper runner out of Florida by way of Puerto Rico 
toyed with the best 3-year-old colts this side of the Mississippi in a horse 
race Saturday. It was like a Joe Louis fight. Over just as soon as the puncher 
got in range. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest record in sports, by common consent, is Joe DiMaggio's 56-game 
hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
Doing a thing over and over is the mark of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Mister Frisky in Saturday's Santa Anita Derby tied a record that had been 
held by -- are you ready for this? -- Citation. He won his 16th consecutive 
race. He has never been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows what kind of a runner this is? He just skims along the ground as if 
he were on roller skates. All the jockey has to do is stay awake. A carousel 
horse couldn't be less trouble. 
</P>
<P>
You listen to trainer Laz Barrera and you come away convinced the horse will be 
able to talk -- in two languages -- by the time he's full grown. He already 
understands Laz, which impresses a lot of scholars right there. 
</P>
<P>
He's not a big horse, barely over 15 hands. But he would be a weightlifter if 
he were human. "There's not five pounds of fat on him and he weighs 1,100 
pounds," boasts trainer Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
If Man o' War was Big Red, this replica might be Little Red. He's solid copper 
from head to fetlock. He looks as if he was minted, not foaled. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the great ones, he does what he has to do. You put a horse in front of 
him, he runs him down. You put a horse behind him, he keeps him there. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Santa Anita Derby Saturday under a hand ride. The jockey doesn't 
need a whip, just a stirrup. It wasn't only what he won, it was how. 
</P>
<P>
He's going to go in the Kentucky Derby next month the way no horse has since 
Seattle Slew and the way only a few in history have -- undefeated. Even the 
great Secretariat had gone in blemished. Even Citation lost a race as a 
2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
His time Saturday was a respectable 1:49 considering he had shown the field who 
was boss by the head of the stretch. It's hard to keep from throwing your hat 
in the air when you review the race. 
</P>
<P>
Something like 69 horses have gone from the Santa Anita Derby to the Kentucky 
Derby. Only 10 have won it. Eight winners of the Santa Anita have won the 
Kentucky Derby. Ferdinand, who was third in the Santa Anita, won at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
But only one Santa Anita Derby winner -- Affirmed -- has won the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
Horses who go into the Kentucky Derby as favorites are supposed to have prepped 
in races such as the Hopeful, the Champagne, the Belmont Futurity, the Gotham 
and the Wood, the high society gambols of the East, not the rodeos of the West. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky learned to race in Puerto Rico. This was widely considered to be 
like setting home run records in Albuquerque or Salt Lake City where the air 
was thin and the pitches fat. Before you get excited, you have to find out who 
was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
But Mister Frisky not only won races in Puerto Rico, he broke clocks and set 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Some women, when they want a birthday present from the husband, put in for a 
mink coat or a new Mercedes or maybe a trip to Monte Carlo. Mrs. Marta 
Fernandez told husband Jose, a construction magnate, she wanted a horse. Not 
some bridle-path pony or hedge-jumper but a real papered thoroughbred. She 
didn't want to chase foxes, she wanted to chase Derbies. 
</P>
<P>
For $15,000, Jose got a bargain. Mister Frisky, unlike a new car or an ocean 
voyage, not only doesn't depreciate, he has shown a profit to date of $526 085, 
the difference between the $15,000 he cost and the $541,085 he has now won. If 
he continues through the Triple Crown he may command fees that will make even 
Man o' War look like a dud at stud. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Fernandez picked him for the most feminine of reasons -- she liked his 
looks. His conformation. "He looked like a square horse, he looked like a 
fighter," she explains. He looked like a good guy to have in a foxhole. 
</P>
<P>
The breeding was not all that undistinguished. Grandfather was Damascus, a 
horse Bill Shoemaker, no less, always said should have won the Triple Crown. He 
did win the Preakness and the Belmont. He finished third in the Kentucky Derby. 
Shoemaker took the blame. 
</P>
<P>
Horses have won the Santa Anita Derby before and have gone to Kentucky to be 
exposed as what the hardboots liked to refer to as "nice little California 
sprinters." Silky Sullivan looked like a plow horse in '58, beating only two 
horses at Churchill at odds of 2-1. Your Host set the precedent in 1950. He 
finished ninth as the darling of the Hollywood crowd, owned by Mogul William 
Goetz and bred by Goetz' father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer. "Movie horses!" sneered 
the Establishment. They won only on sound stages, in John Wayne westerns. 
</P>
<P>
The trend began to reverse about a decade ago. The facts of the matter are, 
three of the last four Kentucky Derbies have been won by Santa Anita Derby 
entrants. 
</P>
<P>
But, the proposition is not whether Mister Frisky belongs in the field at 
Churchill May 5, it's whether he belongs with the legends of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera, who trained the last Triple Crown winner (Affirmed, 1978) and who 
trained the Puerto Rican horse (Bold Forbes) who won the Kentucky Derby and the 
Belmont (and finished third with a cut hoof in the Preakness) thinks Mister 
Frisky should be even money against Man o' War. When he first saw tapes of the 
horse, Laz recalls he felt his scalp prickle. "I noticed the jockey had a bad 
habit of pulling the horse when he got to the lead. I got on the phone and 
said, 'Don't let that jockey do that! He'll get the horse in bad habits! He'll 
think he's supposed to stop!' " 
</P>
<P>
Since Laz has had the horse, there's been no stopping him. "They said he could 
only win in Puerto Rico -- so he won in California. They said he could only win 
at seven furlongs -- so he wins at a mile. They said he could only go a mile -- 
so he goes a mile and an eighth. Now, I suppose they'll say he can't go a mile 
and a quarter. " 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. The only question now is whether Mister Frisky can do card tricks. 
Or save the hero from the rustlers. Or sing Carmen. 
</P>
<P>
As his co-owner, Jose Fernandez was to say, "He's the hero of 3 million Puerto 
Ricans. The governor said he could win the election if he could get Mister 
Frisky to appear on the platform with him. " 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is, if Mister Frisky continues to make money, he will turn 
Republican.

BACK HAS GRETZKY, KINGS ON THIN ICE; 
</P>
<P>
NHL PLAYOFFS: THE GREAT ONE WON'T KNOW UNTIL JUST BEFORE GAME 3 TONIGHT AT 
FORUM IF HE CAN FACE FLAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Today is Game 3 of the playoffs for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
And Day 18 of the Wayne Gretzky Crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is, which will end first? 
</P>
<P>
Once again, anticipation has turned into anxiety, recovery into reassessment. 
</P>
<P>
The latest word on Gretzky's ailing back: No word. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on his long-awaited return to the ice, expected Saturday, has been 
delayed again until 5 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky will drive to the Forum for tonight's third game between the Kings and 
Calgary Flames in their best-of- seven, first-round playoff series, which is 
tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
After yet another consultation with team physician Steve Lombardo, it will be 
decided whether Gretzky will: 
</P>
<P>
a) Be a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
b) Be a specialty performer, appearing only on the power-play unit. 
</P>
<P>
c) Return all the way and take his full shift on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet on the last. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not off Gretzky's comments at the team's Culver City practice rink 
Saturday after the greatest scorer in NHL history practiced with his teammates 
for the first time since suffering a hyperextension of the back March 22. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Gretzky went on the ice for the first time since the injury, skating 
for about 20 minutes while the Kings were in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Gretzky lasted about the same amount of time, skating cautiously, 
shooting tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
Tentative would also best describe his outlook afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know when I'll play," he said. "I've gotten up some days and 
not felt bad. And some days, I've felt like I'm done for a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really need is time. We're doing the best we can and moving as fast as 
we can, but we may not have the time. I hope the hours go by slowly and that I 
heal quickly." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a deceptive injury from the start. Gretzky was hit from behind by 
the New York Islanders' Alan Kerr. The blow shoved Gretzky into Ken 
Baumgartner, creating a whiplash effect. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster didn't see the hit from his spot on the bench. No one 
except Gretzky realized the severity of it at first. 
</P>
<P>
He thought he had a broken back. But, although he was hit in the first minute 
of the game, Gretzky finished the period, hoping he could skate through it. 
</P>
<P>
When he couldn't, he asked out after the period. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky began to experience back spasms. Days turned into weeks, the regular 
season into the playoffs and still no Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Optimism began to run high for a return today after he missed the first two 
playoff games of his 11-year career. The spasms were gone and he was skating 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But other problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no strength in my back," he explained, "no power to push off, to twist. 
I have no flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
"If I play and I am more of a hinderance, that would be no help." 
</P>
<P>
There's another dire possibility as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If I take one hit," he said, "I could be done for a couple of weeks. That 
doesn't make a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
What does make more sense, perhaps bringing Gretzky back too soon and risking 
further injury, or trying to play the defending Stanley Cup champions without 
him? 
</P>
<P>
Decided underdogs after finishing fourth behind Calgary in the Smythe Division, 
the Kings proved they are more than a one-man team by winning Game 1 in the 
Olympic Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be great to get a player like him back," defenseman Larry Robinson 
said, "but, at the same time, it can be detrimental if they're not 100%. 
Calgary is too good to have somebody out there who can't go full out. But with 
a talent like that, it's pretty tough to leave him on the side." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has mentioned using Gretzky only on the power play in his first 
game back, Webster wasn't talking that Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"No way is he going to play unless he can make a contribution," Webster said. 
"If he dresses, we want to make sure he plays. And not in just one specific 
role." 
</P>
<P>
That's fine with Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"If I come back to play," he said, "I want to play. It's in my blood. But, it's 
up to him (Webster)." 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious in Gretzky's face that the pain in his back is matched by pain in 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to play," he said. "This is what it's about. I've lifted the 
(Stanley) Cup four times and it's the greatest feeling in the world." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Faceoff tonight is at 7:30. Game 4 will be at the Forum on Tuesday, as will 
Game 6, if necessary, on Saturday. . . . While Wayne Gretzky's prognosis is 
guarded, the outlook is clearer for defenseman Tom Laidlaw, also out with a 
back injury. Laidlaw skated Saturday for the third straight day and hopes to 
play in Game 4.

MIKE DOWNEY: LEADERS OF MASTERS AREN'T OLD, THEY ARE JUST, UH, EXPERIENCED

<P>
Old golfer sees funeral procession pass by. Doffs his cap. Playing partner 
says: "Thoughtful gesture." Old golfer says: "Yes. We'd have been married 45 
years tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old gag, yeah. Yet that is what the aptly named Masters tournament, in its 54th 
reincarnation, has somewhat charmingly turned into -- an old joke. Golf's elder 
belters are getting a real laugh out of this one, because, rather than being 
put out to pasture, they have been turned loose on a lush green lawn, with 
fragrant flowers, rolling hills and 18 holes, to show the young punks how the 
game was meant to be played. 
</P>
<P>
"What was that old Mickey Mantle line?" asked Tom Kite, a mere babe of 40. " 
'If I'd known I was going to live this long, I'd have taken better care of 
myself?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player, a three-time Masters champion who is the same age as the 
tournament, checked in Saturday with a masterful 68, which might not be the 
least bit unusual, except it was the first time Player had broken 70 here since 
the day he modeled the green jacket in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerontologists are saying that someday soon people will be living to the age 
of 130," Player said, feeling understandably chipper. "I probably won't be 
around to see that day, but some of you younger people might." 
</P>
<P>
He thought it over. 
</P>
<P>
"You might even see it this week," Player said. 
</P>
<P>
See the day, he meant, when golfers 40 to 60 did not have to be reminded to act 
their age. See the day when some well-preserved contestant here shoots his age. 
After all, four senior tour golfers made the Masters' 36-hole cut, and Raymond 
Floyd, the leader after three rounds, seems a driven man in his bid to become, 
at age 47, the oldest ever to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The tone for the week was set on Thursday, when Doug Ford shot the same score 
as Greg Norman. Ford is 67 years old. He has clubs older than Norman. When Ford 
started playing, the only time a golfer used graphite was when he kept track of 
his score with his pencil. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Casper missed the cut by only one stroke. He's 58. Lee Trevino and George 
Archer survived the cut. They're 50. Jack Nicklaus, who became the oldest 
Masters winner at 46, finds himself very much in the hunt again at 50. Every 
day has been Old Timers' Day at Augusta National, where any second we expect to 
discover that this "John Huston" character on the leader board really is the 
late, great actor. 
</P>
<P>
Being old ain't so awful. 
</P>
<P>
"The hole's the same size. The ball's the same size," said Player, who was 
runnerup to Nicklaus at last week's senior tour event in Arizona. "It's the 
same game for everybody. If you keep yourself in shape, you can start a whole 
new career at the age of 50. Not many other sports can do that. I saw Jack 
Nicklaus playing shots better than I've ever seen him play, even when he was 
25." 
</P>
<P>
How about length, though? How about the older golfers who can't hit it as far 
as they once did? 
</P>
<P>
"Length doesn't win golf tournaments. Putting wins golf tournaments," Player 
said. "Putting has crippled more people than polio. 
</P>
<P>
"A good mind is still the most important thing in golf. A good mind and 
putting." 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning cannot be overlooked. Player says he remembers when an old Quonset 
hut on the Augusta National grounds served mainly to store tractors and rakes. 
Now, it houses an adequate workout gym. "I see guys in there now with their fat 
bellies on the bicycles, puffing away," Player said. 
</P>
<P>
Observed Kite: "The thing is, Gary's probably in better shape than 98% of the 
juniors on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
Living proof that a golfer need not be experienced or aerobicized to play 
competitive golf continues to be embodied by the 305-pound Chris Patton, a 
constant reminder that this is not miniature golf. Then again, Nicklaus was no 
anorexic when he won his first Masters, nor was Casper, nor was Craig Stadler. 
It should please Patton to know that someday, the official Masters tailor won't 
need to custom-make a green jacket in 56-Long. 
</P>
<P>
As for age, keep in mind that only four of the top 31 players on today's board 
-- Huston, Patton, Spain's Jose-Maria Olazabal and Northern Ireland's Ronan 
Rafferty -- are under 30. Four more -- Floyd, Nicklaus, Player and Trevino -- 
are 47 or older. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, how Player played, 29 years from the weekend he won his first Masters. As 
playing partner Larry Nelson was leaving the premises, his first remark was 
that it was "one of the finest rounds of golf I've ever been privileged to 
witness." Player's single-bogey round included a pitching-wedge shot at No. 7 
that nestled 15 inches from the cup, and similarly deft iron play, hole after 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
Good putting, a good mind, a good body . . . these are necessary, sure, but . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"One also has to have incentive," Player said. "Incentive gets people going. 
That's why socialism and communism are dying before our very eyes." Perhaps he 
could appreciate the need for political change, being a native South African. 
</P>
<P>
Changes on many fronts can occur, provided one sticks around long enough. Maybe 
the next guy who wins the Masters will look as old as a face on a box of Dutch 
Masters cigars. Or maybe Gary Player will, indeed, live to be 130. They might 
have to organize a third Senior tour, for golfers in triple figures.

Two days ago, Tom Watson sank a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, just to 
make the Masters cut. A par on that hole would have sent the two-time champion 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
"Good omen," Watson said.

After a 67 Saturday, Watson is nine strokes off the lead and tied for 12th 
place. His work is cut out for him, but remember, Jack Nicklaus stood in ninth 
place after three rounds in 1986 before winning. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young man's golf course," Watson said, despite the success of 
Nicklaus and 47-year-old leader Raymond Floyd. "You need a young man's nerves 
to play it." 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 39, won the Masters in 1977 and 1981, but has won only one tour event 
(the 1987 Nabisco) in the past six years. The fault lies in his putting, which, 
he admits, has been shaky for four or five years now. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said he has hundreds of putters in his basement at home. 
</P>
<P>
He's using one this week that was sent to him by a friend in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a better sight line," Watson said, adding that he calls the putter, 
"Ugly Duckling." 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he sees in amateur Chris Patton, Gary Player said: "I see a 
hell of a lot of him." 
</P>
<P>
Patton weighs approximately 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When Patton was asked if he's related to the former great amateur player Billy 
Joe Patton, or Gen. George Patton, Chris said: 
</P>
<P>
"They never come to our family reunion." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, who matched Nick Faldo for the low round of the day with a 
six-under-par 66 (214), is asked at every tournament if he's hungry to win his 
first major. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can do is play well," Kite said patiently. "I have no control 
over the guys on the leader board. I'm a good enough player if I take care of 
Tom Kite's business. . . I'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago today, Jimmy Demaret won the Masters. He took home $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Weiskopf, who finished second four times in the Masters and is now a 
television commentator for the tournament, recalled the years that he had to 
"baby-sit" Brent Musburger when he was a CBS sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Brent was not a golfer," Weiskopf told the Chicago Tribune. "He didn't 
understand the terminology, jargon, or tradition of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"My job was to baby-sit Musburger in this telecast. I was told to tell him 
everything I knew about Augusta National and golf in general. It was not a 
pleasant situation." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd commiserated with Mike Donald, who shot an 82 Friday after opening with a 
64 in his first Masters competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my first year here (1965)," he said. "I had a 69 the first day and 
then I was paired with Arnold Palmer and I shot an 83. It's difficult to come 
here as a rookie and shoot a good opening round and then play the second day 
while leading the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"You have never seen such a press corp, and then there's all that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Donald continued to have problems. After a first-round record 64, Donald added 
a 77 to his second-day 82. He now leads only two golfers in the remaining 
49-player field. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer had his poorest 36-hole score (156) in four years, but vowed not to quit 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to play for a little while yet," said Palmer, 60, who has not made 
the cut since 1983. "Probably another year or so, then maybe not. I'm going to 
go lengthen my driving and come back next year and challenge."

BROWN SHOOTS 69, LEADS BY A STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Then and now: 
</P>
<P>
A golfer is on the brink of winning her first LPGA tournament. She is alone in 
first place after three rounds, but collapses on the final day and falls into a 
tie for 17th. One year later, the golfer returns to same course. She is on the 
brink of winning her first LPGA tournament. She is alone in first place after 
three rounds. And it's the final day. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to StoneRidge Country Club in Poway, and meet Nancy Brown. She is that 
golfer in the wonderful, awful position of leading the Red Robin Kyocera 
Inamori tournament. She shot a two-under-par 69 Saturday and is at eight-under 
205 after three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Missie McGeorge is one stroke back at 206. Cathy Gerring and Kris Monaghan are 
tied for third, four strokes back at 209. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four leaders have won an LPGA tournament before, but it doesn't 
seem to matter. People are wondering one thing: 
</P>
<P>
What is Brown thinking? 
</P>
<P>
Brown smiles, jokes and answers the question. She knows people will be watching 
her today. No, she didn't spend much time looking at the leader board Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But she remembers last year when she was breezing along with a seven-under 206, 
then went out on that fateful Sunday and shot a 78. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, she birdied the 17th -- the sixth time in the seven times she has 
played it -- and that put her eight under. 
</P>
<P>
What was Brown thinking? 
</P>
<P>
"I had a birdie on 17, so I wasn't seven-under (like last year)," she said 
before anyone could ask her a question. "I just want you to know that." 
</P>
<P>
Brown took the lead from Lenore Rittenhouse on Friday when Rittenhouse went 
from six under to par. She held it Saturday with three birdies -- on the fifth, 
ninth and 17th holes. 
</P>
<P>
She missed only two greens, the third and fifth. Her birdie on the par-five 
17th came on a 10-foot putt after she put her second shot in the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
McGeorge was her biggest challenger all day, although Patti Rizzo came within 
two strokes by going five under before two bogeys in the last four holes pushed 
her back into a tie for fifth at 210. It was Rizzo who overtook Brown in the 
final round last year at StoneRidge. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to be very nervous," Rizzo said. "I could make a prediction, but I 
won't -- I'll save it for (today). If she can keep it going, it might be her 
turn." 
</P>
<P>
At least Brown was swinging better than she was in Gerring's dream Friday 
night. Gerring, who shot a 67 to tie Rosie Jones for the best round Saturday, 
said she dreamed Brown hit her ball inside of a house and couldn't get it out. 
In this dream, Gerring walked over and asked Brown, "Is this what happened to 
you last year, too?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was really, really strange," Gerring said. "I don't normally remember 
dreams, but for some reason, I remember that." 
</P>
<P>
Gerring started the day even and had five birdies, three on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
McGeorge started the day at four under and had two bogeys in her first five 
holes before collecting five birdies over the last 13. She birdied 15 with a 
25-foot putt and 18 with a 15-foot putt to stay one stroke behind Brown. 
</P>
<P>
LPGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ayako Okamoto, who won the tournament in 1987 and 1988, is tied for fifth at 
210, three under. . . . Patty Sheehan, who has won the tournament three times, 
is tied for 32nd at 217. . . . Betsy King, winner of the Nabisco Dinah Shore 
tournament last weekend, double-bogeyed No. 1 and wasn't able to get lower than 
three under. She finished two under, tied for ninth at 211.

SILLS WAS A BIG WINNER BEFORE HIS FIRST VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was almost inevitable that when Tony Sills broke through to win his first 
PGA tournament, the golfing world would be looking the other way. 
</P>
<P>
When Sills ended nearly 20 years of frustration and adversity with a playoff 
victory over Gil Morgan last Sunday in the Independent Insurance Agent Open at 
The Woodlands, Tex., Jack Nicklaus was winning his first Senior PGA Tour 
tournament in Arizona, and Betsy King was drawing closer to the LPGA Hall of 
Fame with another victory in the Nabisco Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
That Sills, one of only two players from Los Angeles to win on the PGA Tour in 
recent history, won at all is a remarkable testimony to the 34-year-old 
golfer's grit, determination and patience. Not to mention a golf swing he 
learned while beating balls into a net in Walter Keller's shop in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He had to learn on an indoor driving range because his father couldn't afford a 
country club membership, and the L.A. City Recreation and Parks Dept. wouldn't 
let him play at Rancho until he was 14 -- even though he shot a 38 on the 
course during an age-group tournament when he was 9. 
</P>
<P>
That, it would turn out, would be one of the lesser problems he would have to 
deal with. 
</P>
<P>
Sills won the L.A. Junior championship in 1971 and shot several rounds in the 
high 60s at Riviera, where he worked as a caddie while leading Palisades High 
School to a championship season. (The only other modern-era tour winner from 
L.A. City schools was Mac O'Grady, who as Phil McGleno attended Hamilton High). 
</P>
<P>
When Sills turned 18, he was looking forward to playing at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was hospitalized with a near-fatal case of colitis that forced him 
to undergo an ileostomy in which his colon and rectum were removed. He was 
fitted with an external pouch that he used for 10 years, even when playing 
golf. His weight fell from 170 pounds to barely 100, and a year later, in 1975, 
he underwent more surgery for an attack of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this setback, Sills returned to golf, and in 1976, while a student at 
El Camino College, won the Southern California Amateur championship at 
California Country Club. Among the players he beat were Scott Simpson, who 
would later help USC win two NCAA championships and win the U.S. Open, and 
future professionals Mark O'Meara and John Cook. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Sills enrolled at USC and played well enough to try for a tour 
player's card in 1980. He won the 1981 Queen Mary Open in Long Beach, but it 
took him six tries before he got his card in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the luckiest guy in the world just to be playing on the tour," he said at 
the time. "I've caddied, delivered pizzas, ground clubs at Jerry Barber's 
factory, picked up range balls, worked for a beer distributor. You name it, 
I've done it. I can't believe I'm actually on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
Sills lost his card three times for failing to earn enough money, but each time 
he battled back to earn it again. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he underwent an eight-hour operation in which a pouch was formed 
internally from his lower intestines, so that a tube could be inserted through 
a hole in his stomach to relieve waste. 
</P>
<P>
"That made it much better for me because I didn't have to run to the bathroom 
as much," he said. "I never felt like I had it rough, though, because my dad 
had it 10 times worse than I did. He was a diabetic for 20 years and about the 
time I first became ill, he lost his eyesight and developed cancer. I'll never 
feel sorry for myself after seeing what he went through. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe my entire career to my dad. He was the one who got me started. The 
doctors advised him to take up golf for his health when I was 5, and I tagged 
along with him and finally started hitting balls." 
</P>
<P>
Sills had his best year in 1986, when he tied for second in the Phoenix Open, 
his highest finish in seven years on the tour, and earned more than $200,000 to 
finish 38th on the PGA Tour money list. 
</P>
<P>
But he faltered in 1987 and lost his card again. Twice since then, he has been 
forced to play his way back through the grueling qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal life has been devastated for two years with a divorce," he told 
reporters after Sunday's victory. "Divorce is just hell, and you can't play 
golf when your personal life is in shambles. I've just been trying to make it 
through a day at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, he qualified 27th at The Woodlands -- the same course where he won 
on Sunday -- to make it back on tour for the fourth time. Before Sunday, he had 
earned a modest $55,800 this year and stood 75th on the list. His best finish 
was a tie for seventh in the Nissan Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the right place at the right time," he said Sunday. "The leader board 
was packed with big names, but when no one made a big move, there I was." 
</P>
<P>
Sills started the final round of the rain-shortened 54-hole tournament six 
strokes behind co-leaders Hal Sutton and David Peoples, but he should have 
known it was going to be his day when he skipped a mis-hit four-iron across a 
pond on the second hole. Instead of a watery double bogey, Sills sank a 10-foot 
putt for his par. 
</P>
<P>
With marquee names such as Simpson, Seve Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam, Fred 
Couples, Larry Mize, Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Bruce Lietzke and Ben Crenshaw 
hovering near or atop the leader board, Sills sneaked into a share of the lead 
with four birdies in his final five holes for a seven-under-par 65. 
</P>
<P>
This put him in a playoff with Morgan, a veteran who has won seven tournaments 
-- including the L.A. Open in 1978 and 1983. When Morgan took three putts from 
45 feet on the first playoff hole, a 428-yard par-four, Sills won with a tap-in 
par from about a foot. 
</P>
<P>
It was worth $180,000, more than he earned in the past two seasons combined, 
but it also got him two years' exemption from qualifying plus a trip to the 
Masters and the Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Annandale GC in Pasadena will play host to the 1993 U.S. Women's Amateur 
Championship. It will be the club's second time around. It was held there in 
1967, when Mary Lou Dill defeated Jean Ashley in the final. . . . The Players 
West tour for California-based women professionals will stop this week at 
Upland Hills CC. A pro-am Monday precedes the 54-hole championship. Beneficiary 
of the pro-am will be the 1st United Methodist Church of Ontario Food Bank. . .

NEWSWIRE: MICHAELS MAY BREAK WITH ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of the firing of Brent Musburger by CBS, Al Michaels has taken the 
first step in an attempt to break his contract at ABC Sports and move to CBS, 
the Washington Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Michaels Friday filed for arbitration with the American 
Federation of Television and Radio Artists in Los Angeles, claiming the network 
breached his contract when it suspended him without pay for a nepotism incident 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels has three years remaining on a contract that industry sources say is 
worth $1.5 million to $2 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was meted out after Michaels' teenage daughter was hired as a 
messenger during ABC's broadcast of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 
Salt Lake City, according to reports. ABC officials have refused to confirm the 
suspension.

ARCADIA SPRINTS GO TO MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two years, Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir battled two-time state sprint 
champion Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa in the Arcadia Invitational track 
and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore in 1988, Miller gained recognition by finishing second to 
Burnham in the 100 and 200 meters, and last season she became known nationally 
in splitting sprint victories with her Rio Mesa rival. 
</P>
<P>
With Burnham now a UCLA freshman, Miller had to face a new Rio Mesa sprinter in 
freshman Marion Jones Saturday in the 23rd Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly windy night, the 5-foot-5 Miller had to come from behind in both 
sprints to defeat the taller but younger Jones. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100 meters, Miller overcame a bad start and a strong midrace burst by 
Jones to win in 11.71 seconds to Jones' 11.78. 
</P>
<P>
"I was left behind at the start, and I had to catch up in the last 30 meters," 
Miller said. "It was really close there at the end." Miller also anchored 
Muir's winning 400-meter relay team, which established a national-leading mark 
of 46.07. 
</P>
<P>
The matchup was even closer in the 200 meters, as Jones attacked in the first 
75 meters to take a five-meter lead. But Miller was able to catch Jones at the 
finish and win in a meet record of 23.57, the fastest time in the nation this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 100, I thought I had her, but somehow she snuck up on me and won," said 
Jones, whose time of 23.80 is a national record for 14 year olds. "(In the 
200), I knew she would be there, so I just tried to hold her off, but I think 
her experience helped her." 
</P>
<P>
For Miller, the matchups with Jones rekindled memories of her first meetings 
with Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just like when I was in 10th grade and I lost two close races to 
Angela," said Miller, who was named the girls' outstanding meet performer. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan Burks of Los Angeles Washington and Andre Green of Long Beach Poly 
exchanged victories in the boys' 100 and 200.

CAPRIATI AND NAVRATILOVA WIN, WILL MEET IN FINAL

<P>
American teen-ager Jennifer Capriati continued to live up to her billing 
Saturday by reaching her second final in only her third tournament since 
turning professional last month. 
</P>
<P>
The unseeded 14-year-old overwhelmed sixth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet 
Union, 6-0, 6-4, in 57 minutes to earn a shot at Martina Navratilova, who is 19 
years older than Capriati, in the final of the $500,000 Family Circle Magazine 
Cup at Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, seeded first and a three-time champion in the tournament, 
eliminated unseeded Regina Rajchrtova of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 6-3, without 
losing a service game. 
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamed I would get to the finals of a pro tournament playing 
Martina. I'm really happy. She's a legend," said Capriati, who lost in her 
first final appearance to third-ranked Gabriela Sabatini last month. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati raced through the first set against the 14th-ranked Zvereva in 17 
minutes by rushing the net and repeatedly scoring with volley winners. 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva finally held serve in the second game of the second set and managed to 
break Capriati in the fifth game to lead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati won the next three games to go up, 5-3, and after dropping her serve 
in the ninth game, she broke Zvereva to close out her victory. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova was unable to go to her usual attacking game on the slow, green 
clay and instead relied on nearly error-free shot-making to control points on 
her serve. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Christo van Rensburg of South Africa defeated David Pate, 6-7 
(2-7), 6-3, 7-5, to advance to the final of a $250,000 tournament in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In today's final, van Rensberg will play top-seeded Brad Gilbert, who defeated 
qualifier MaliVai Washington, 6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert has a 4-0 record against van Rensburg. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg broke Pate in the 11th game of the third set when Pate netted a 
forehand volley. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Chesnokov defeated Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, as part of the 
Forum Tennis challenge.

U.S. SOCCER TEAM, AFTER TWO LOSSES IN EUROPE, PLAYS ICELAND

<P>
The United States soccer team, after a brief and not quite happy trip to 
Eastern Europe, will have a chance to meet a team more to its level when it 
plays Iceland today. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team's 0-2 swing through Hungary and East Germany left it wiser and 
determined to improve on its 3-5 record compiled since qualifying for the World 
Cup for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for this young team is that despite a 2-0 loss to Hungary and a 
3-2 loss to East Germany last month, it is progressing. The team is still 
learning to react to different styles, and Coach Bob Gansler has been juggling 
his lineup to find the right combinations. 
</P>
<P>
With the World Cup only two months away, there are few spots on the team that 
are locked up. Perhaps the most interesting battle is at goalkeeper, where Tony 
Meola and Kasey Keller have been battling. Meola played both games in Europe so 
Keller is likely to start against Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
Iceland has a lot to gain by beating the United States. Iceland did not qualify 
for the WorldCup, despite tying two teams that did -- the Soviet Union and 
Austria. Iceland finished 1-3-4 in its group. 
</P>
<P>
Iceland is providing a new look on this tour. It has a new coach in Bob 
Johansson, who has been in that position only a month. At least five of 
Iceland's best players are not with the team because they are fulfilling 
obligations to European professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
The team playing here will be young and inexperienced and not familiar to 
playing together. But Iceland is still favored to win the game. JULIE CART

BERNSON IS COUNCIL'S TOP TRAVEL SPENDER; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: HE SPENT $120,622 IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON TRAVEL DURING THE LAST THREE 
YEARS -- FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNCIL MEMBER. 
</P>

<P>
In 1987, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, his wife and three daughters 
jetted overseas for a 17-day visit. In Israel, he toured a day-care center and 
a Red Sea kibbutz and met with the mayor of Tel Aviv. In Italy, he discussed 
earthquake preparedness with a former government official. In both countries, 
he stayed in luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The tab for the trip -- more than $24,000 -- was paid through the councilman's 
private treasury of political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Bernson has spent $120,622 in campaign funds on travel during 
the last three years -- far more than anyone else on the 15-member City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's privately financed travel expenses were nearly three times as high as 
those of Mayor Tom Bradley, who spent $44,939, and exceeded those of Gov. 
George Deukmejian, who spent $72,260 during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Council members spent an annual average of $8,635 in privately raised funds and 
$2,427 in city funds on travel during the last three years, a Times survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bernson, a number of council members used private funds -- from their 
reelection accounts, political action committees, officeholder accounts and 
"friends committees" -- to travel extensively in the United States and abroad 
for a variety of conferences, tours and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Use of private political funds for travel is legal, providing it is related to 
government or political purposes. Pleasure trips are prohibited. But state 
officials acknowledge that the law is vague and difficult to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
"Many statutes are enforced by public opinion, and I think this is one where 
that's an important ingredient," Asst. Atty. Gen. N. Eugene Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Between Jan. 1, 1987, and Dec. 31, 1989, Bernson and his wife traveled not only 
to Italy and Israel, but also to Paris, Hong Kong, London, Beijing and British 
Columbia, plus New Orleans, New York, Seattle, Boston, Carmel and Hilo, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said in a recent interview that his privately funded travel was not 
excessive and all his trips were proper. Much of his travel, he said, was to 
attend conferences related to his membership on the state Seismic Safety 
Commission and in the National League of Cities. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley councilman also said information acquired while 
traveling helps him "to do my job and to accomplish the things I've 
accomplished for the city." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's nearest rival, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, used $93,883 in 
campaign funds for travel, according to reports required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
During the last half of 1989, Flores -- now a candidate for secretary of state 
-- spent $7,500 on air and rail fare and an additional $13,000 on 
accommodations for her aides and herself, records show. She visited Montreal, 
London, Paris, Brussels, Moscow and Bordeaux, France, where she attended a 
world oceanology conference. She also toured Eastern Europe -- including stops 
in Prague, Warsaw and Berlin -- last December and January. 
</P>
<P>
Flores spent nearly $9,000 for a midsummer staff retreat at the Biltmore Hotel 
in Phoenix, Ariz. The councilwoman normally holds the retreat in the Los 
Angeles area, but aides said it was moved to Arizona because airlines and the 
hotel offered reduced off-season rates. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said the travel is relevant to her duties as chairwoman of the council's 
Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees operation of 
the Port of Los Angeles and the city's airports. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, for example, she met with French railroad officials. In Montreal, she 
toured the control room for that city's subway system. 
</P>
<P>
From 1987 to 1989, Councilman Robert Farrell spent $76,214 in campaign funds on 
travel, visiting Atlanta, New York City, Washington and South Africa. Last 
July, Farrell went to Egypt for a week to help formalize a sister-city 
relationship between Los Angeles and Giza and to attend a political conference 
of black women. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said the trips "all helped me to better represent my constituency." 
</P>
<P>
In privately financed travel, Farrell was followed by council members Richard 
Alatorre with $32,754; Joel Wachs, $28,489; Gloria Molina, $9,255; Michael Woo, 
$8,139, and Zev Yaroslavsky, $8,639. Ernani Bernardi, Ruth Galanter and John 
Ferraro spent no campaign funds for travel. However, Ferraro, the council 
president, spent $32,083 in public funds on travel -- roughly twice what the 
mayor spent. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Alatorre's trips were to U.S. cities and were related to National 
League of Cities conferences and posts the councilman has held with the 
Democratic National Committee, his staff said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre traveled to Mexico in 1988 to meet with students and government 
officials in a university exchange program, said his chief deputy, Al Avila. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, an art collector and arts advocate, attributed most of his $28,489 in 
campaign-paid travel -- including a dozen trips to New York City -- to his 
interest in public art. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Wachs made a one-week trip to Venice for a "livable cities" 
conference. In 1987, he toured museums in the Netherlands, France, Italy, 
Germany and Switzerland. Wachs said the purpose of the $6,000 tour was to seek 
exhibits for the privately run Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
"The arts are really critical to the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Bernson's campaign-financed travel has far outstripped that of 
the other council members. 
</P>
<P>
A conservative Republican who has represented the northwestern San Fernando 
Valley since 1979, Bernson collects a council salary of $61,522 a year and owns 
a modest Granada Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
But, using campaign funds, he has been able to fly first-class, stay in plush 
hotels and pick up large meal tabs for himself and others. From 1987 to 1989, 
records show, he spent at least $25,210 in political funds for hotel rooms and 
meals on the road. The expenses ranged from $3,203 for his family's stay at the 
landmark King David Hotel in Jerusalem to $410 Bernson spent on meals and 
drinks for 10 political supporters at the Del Mar race track two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said much of his privately raised money has been spent on fact-finding 
missions involving land-use regulation and transportation matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally . . . I'd rather not travel at all," he said. "I mean, it gets to 
be a real pain, even at its best." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's private contributions have soared since 1987 when he became chairman 
of the council's powerful Planning and Land Use Management Committee, which 
recommends development projects to the full council. Although contributions to 
Bernson averaged $135,500 a year from 1981 to 1985, they jumped to $457,000 in 
1988 and $258,000 in 1989, campaign reports show. More than half of the 
donations came from development- and real estate-related interests. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1981 state law, such funds can be used for travel if the trips have a 
"reasonable relationship" to government, legislative or political business. 
Guidelines issued by the state attorney general in 1986 said the funds can be 
used for travel only if at least half the time abroad is spent on official or 
political matters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bernson's campaign-financed travels -- such as a 1988 trip to attend 
the Republican National Convention in New Orleans -- are well within the law. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernson's 1987 Hawaii trip appeared to violate state guidelines, state 
Asst. Atty. Gen. Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he and his wife were in Hawaii for two days and three nights. His 
campaign funds paid at least $2,232 for the trip, including a $1,196 hotel 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman -- who has taken a lead role in seismic safety issues in Los 
Angeles -- said he went to gather information on Hawaiian 
emergency-preparedness operations and to see how local officials coped with the 
then-erupting Kilauea volcano. 
</P>
<P>
On his first day in Hawaii, Bernson said, he met for about an hour with Harry 
Kim, head of Hawaii County civil defense operations, to discuss disaster relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Kim disputed that account, saying the meeting lasted about 20 minutes. "There 
was little in-depth discussion as far as our operations or his operations, or 
our problems or his problems," said Kim, adding that Bernson appeared for the 
meeting in Bermuda shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Bernson said, he took a helicopter flight over the volcano that 
lasted "the morning." He acknowledged that there were no disaster officials 
with him on the flight, only tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he overflew the volcano in his capacity as a state seismic safety 
commissioner. He said he was gathering information on volcano-induced earth 
movement in connection with the Mammoth Lakes area, in which geologists say 
there may one day be volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state Seismic Safety Commission has no jurisdiction over 
volcano-related issues, said L. Thomas Tobin, the panel's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. Atty. Gen. Hill, after a Times reporter related details of the Hawaii 
trip, said it appeared that the journey "probably would not meet" state 
guidelines on campaign-paid travel. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill said it is unlikely that the councilman could be charged with 
violating the state travel law, which Hill described as very broadly written 
and difficult to enforce. "It's very difficult for us to say a trip doesn't 
have a political or legislative purpose when an elected official says it does," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hill said, the law carried only a one-year statute of limitations and 
was replaced last Jan. 1 by a new law, which transfers its enforcement from the 
attorney general to the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law's 1981 enactment, no elected official has been charged for not 
devoting enough time to business while on a trip financed by private political 
funds, Hill said. Violations are punishable by civil fines of up to two times 
the amount of campaign money improperly spent. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, his wife and at least six friends took a one-day bus tour from London 
to the village of Brockenhurst, about 60 miles away, during a four-day trip to 
England in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although he acknowledged that he spoke to no government officials, Bernson said 
he visited historical monuments and small villages because England's land-use 
patterns have possible applications in Porter Ranch, a massive residential 
development that has been proposed for his council district. 
</P>
<P>
The Times described the trip and Bernson's reasons for taking it to Mark 
Haarer, assistant director of Common Cause, a public-interest lobbying group 
that has criticized Bernson campaign fund-raising in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Haarer said it appeared that Bernson had gone abroad to perform some 
government-related business that could have been carried out in the United 
States. "If I were a Hal Bernson campaign contributor," he said, "I'd wonder 
why campaign funds were used to go to Europe to study small towns where there 
is an abundance of small-town examples in our own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's biggest recent year for travel was 1988, during which he spent 
$79,312 in campaign money. In 1987, he spent $36,053. Last year the figure 
dropped to $5,257, after local newspapers printed stories regarding some trips. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said one reason his campaign-paid travel tab is so high is that he 
rarely bills the city for his journeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't travel any more than any other member of the council; in fact, I 
probably travel less," he said. "The difference is they charge theirs to the 
city. I could do that but I don't feel comfortable doing that." 
</P>
<P>
City records show Bernson was the council's fourth-heaviest spender of public 
funds for travel during 1987-89, billing the city $11,487. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson sometimes uses campaign dollars to enhance amenities on trips where he 
bills the city for basic expenses, thereby avoiding the city's more restrictive 
travel reimbursement rules. He has used campaign funds to bring along his wife, 
upgrade airline tickets and pay large meal bills. 
</P>
<P>
On a 1988 trip to Beijing to attend an international earthquake conference, for 
example, Bernson billed the city $1,277 for air fare but flew on a first-class 
ticket that actually cost $3,307, city documents show. The difference was paid 
with campaign money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he must travel first class on lengthy trips because his wife has a 
bad back and comfort is important on a long flight. He often stays in plush 
hotels because "I don't have to stay in fleabags," he said.

A HUNGER FOR ATTENTION PROPELS TAGGERS ON THEIR NIGHTLY ROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four teen-agers sauntered down a darkened Long Beach street until they 
reached a delivery truck parked at the curb. Three of the four stationed 
themselves as lookouts. The fourth approached the truck's broad white side. 
</P>
<P>
He produced a spray can from under his coat and painted in quick, deft strokes. 
Moments later, the only trace of the outlaws was their handiwork: a string of 
black, stylized letters marking the fleeting presence of these vandals of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Time elapsed: about 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to see my name up," said a 15-year-old called Acer, one of the lookouts 
on that recent night. 
</P>
<P>
"What a bunch of jerks," says Paul Miranda, a homeowner who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
This is no ordinary graffiti, but a quick-hit variety known as tagging. The 
challenge as the youths see it is to be the fastest, the boldest, to scrawl 
one's name on the most surfaces in the shortest time. The challenge for 
authorities is to try to stem the staggering increase in property damage that 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, tagging, imported from the subways of New York City, has dramatically 
proliferated on the streets, buses and freeway overpasses of Southern 
California. Stylized insignias are everywhere, and they are frustrating law 
enforcement officials, neighborhood leaders and taxpayers who pay millions 
annually for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
But a strange transformation has occurred somewhere along the route from East 
Coast urban plague to West Coast youth craze. Police say that tagging, long 
associated with gang activity, has become more or less a street sport in Los 
Angeles, albeit a destructive one. 
</P>
<P>
Tag teams of teen-agers compete for style and space. Star performers worry 
about their reputations among peers. Leaders hold practice sessions to improve 
the skills of their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better than being in a gang," said one member of a Long Beach-based 
tagging crew called Knocking off Suckas -- or KOS. "This is a hobby." 
</P>
<P>
KOS members -- who generally carry markers with them and admit to spending many 
of their waking hours tagging -- say they know of at least six other active tag 
teams in Long Beach alone. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, they say, dozens of other known crews patrol the streets, 
including the Notorious Kings (NTSK); Kings With Style (KWS); King Time Lords 
(KTL) and Under The Influence (UTI). 
</P>
<P>
Generally based in the neighborhood where its members live or attend school, a 
crew may have hundreds of adherents between the ages of 9 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
When tagging, the youngsters inscribe their crew's initials along with their 
own stylized "signatures," or tag names. Favorite targets include trucks, sound 
walls, buses, buildings and street signs -- any surface that is likely to be 
seen by large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
Strategies for reaching overhead freeway signs include shimmying down 
embankments or overpasses to get to them, the youths say. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to be known all over the city," said a tagger who goes by the 
name Crazie. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just signing our autographs, but on walls," said another, known as 
Saker. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the anguish, exasperation and cleanup costs the taggers cause 
homeowners, store owners, other property owners and government agencies? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care," a youth called Biser said. "They don't do nothing for us." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists who have examined the phenomenon say personal and group 
recognition is a big part of what fuels the trend. There is little 
understanding of the realities of property damage. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who don't feel that they have any recognition or power in the 
world," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who specializes in 
youth trends. "This is their way of making the only statement that they know 
how to make and, at least in their group, it makes an impression." 
</P>
<P>
B. David Brooks, a psychologist and educator who trains police how to deal with 
gang members and graffiti artists, agrees. "It's a way that they build a pseudo 
self-esteem," he said of taggers. "They get a big rush." 
</P>
<P>
The number of taggers in Los Angeles County is estimated to be 3,000 to 5,000, 
up to four times what it was believed to be in 1986, experts say. Originally, 
many came from lower-income Latino backgrounds, but tagging has begun to draw 
practitioners from almost all ethnic and economic groups, including 
upper-middle-class kids. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last year, it's really gotten out of hand," said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Robert Contreras, adding that the youths seem more and more 
unrepentant. "Now it's more of a sport. It's no longer just gangs." 
</P>
<P>
On the streets, tag crews tend to stay within their neighborhoods and in some 
cases even assign specific areas to specific taggers. But occasional "battles" 
do break out. Recently, for instance, KOS members decided to take on a crew 
called BES for encroaching on their turf. During a single day of concerted 
"mobbing," the taggers said, they virtually "took out" the rival club by 
covering each of its painted insignias with one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The results of all this spraying, marking and inscribing, of course, have been 
devastating to the property owners, local municipalities and public agencies 
that have been hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District, whose buses are favored 
targets, spent about $10 million in 1989 cleaning the stuff off -- three times 
what it spent just four years ago. During the past year, according to RTD 
officials, a special anti-graffiti unit has cited or arrested more than 800 
people -- most of them juveniles -- for vandalism. Yet the problem keeps 
getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities have increased the amount of money set aside for battling graffiti, 
and some law enforcement agencies are offering sizable rewards for information 
leading to the arrests of taggers. They are also trying to catch taggers by 
videotaping their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of some areas are beginning to fight back by organizing informal 
neighborhood patrols to either ward off or capture the vandals in the midst of 
their destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"People are really getting disturbed by all this garbage," said Miranda, a 
retired city employee who has lived in the same Long Beach neighborhood for 35 
years. "(Residents) are going to have to start taking care of what's important 
to them -- this is our community and we have to start doing something. We can't 
just let these idiotic little jerks go around painting everything." 
</P>
<P>
Said a Long Beach parks employee who spends much of his time painting over 
graffiti-splattered walls: "We just painted and it's back up already. It makes 
us feel like we're wasting time." 
</P>
<P>
Getting caught isn't much of a deterrent. Although tagging is a misdemeanor 
carrying fines of $40 to $250 for repeat offenders, law enforcement officials 
say first-time offenders often get off with a warning or probation. Some judges 
are beginning to mete out public-service sentences that include time spent 
cleaning up graffiti, but officials say the tactic so far has not had a 
measurable effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The judges lecture them up one side and down the other," said Art Close, a 
Lakewood attorney who has represented taggers, "but what can you do when you 
have a kid coming in at 14 for a minor offense while you have other guys coming 
in for rape and murder? Looking at the judges' caseloads, (they) can't spend 
much time on this type of offense." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent gathering of KOS members at a Long Beach park where they meet about 
every two weeks, the legal ramifications for their actions were low on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you guys to know how to write," 14-year-old Ciper told the more than 20 
kids sitting quietly at picnic tables, some marking their names on the wood. "I 
want you to learn. You guys know my phone number -- if you need any help, just 
ask me." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Ciper told his followers, he had personally "booted" a number 
of taggers from the group. The quality of their tagging styles had fallen below 
club standards, he said, which require tags to be attractive and have letters 
that match. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever you guys live," said Saker, another tagger, "try to write more. We 
want everyone to know KOS. If you get caught, don't let that stop you." 
</P>
<P>
At night, on the streets and alleyways, the obsession gets fully vented. After 
marking up the white delivery truck on a recent evening, the KOS team fanned 
out quickly on both sides of the street, defacing signposts and storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier the same night they had been threatened by a gang member who, 
apparently mistaking them for rivals, had waved a gun in their faces. So now, 
they figured, they had two enemies, the gangs and the police. Shortly 
afterward, a third one appeared -- a man who worked in one of the buildings the 
crew was tagging. Stepping outside, he questioned them pointedly, shook a fist, 
and appeared to make for a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The taggers scattered in panic. Then, running down a side street, they 
regrouped in front of a large clean block wall, only to have to retreat again 
moments later when the headlights of a passing car appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they reached an alley in which the lights were low and the traffic 
sparse. They sprayed and marked with impunity, hitting garage doors and 
back-yard walls as they went. As they emptied spray cans, they dropped them 
where they were and resumed the assault with grease markers. 
</P>
<P>
In less than an hour the taggers had made a wide loop of several blocks, ending 
at the burger joint from which they had begun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a habit," explained a tagger called Dsire. "Once you start, you can't 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
"It's addictive," Saker said. "You see someone's name up there and you just 
want yours up too."

ALLEGED DRUG SALES FROM NAVY FRIGATE INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine sailors from a Long Beach-based guided missile frigate, including the 
vessel's top law enforcement officer, are being investigated by the Navy for 
various drug related offenses, including allegedly running a drug distribution 
network and tampering with mandatory urinalysis tests, a Navy spokesman said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is expected to bring charges against some or all of the sailors as 
early as this week, according to Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser, a spokesman for Rear 
Adm. Alvar Gomez, commander of the Long Beach Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations include the use and distribution of marijuana and 
crystal-methamphetamine (commonly known as ice) both on and off the frigate 
John A. Moore, Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to specify how many of the sailors were involved in each of the 
alleged offenses. The Navy would not release the names of any sailors involved 
in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Seven sailors, including the ship's master-at-arms or "head policeman", have 
been restricted to barracks at the Terminal Island installation since March 15, 
when special investigators concluded the seven-month undercover portion of the 
operation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sailors have been allowed to remain aboard the frigate, which has escorted 
oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and now serves as a naval reserve training 
ship. Navy investigators have interviewed at least 18 of the ship's 160 crew 
members during the last three weeks, and there may be additional suspects, 
Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy certainly regards this as serious," Chesser said. "When we become 
aware of something like this, we take vigorous action to correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Chesser said allegations involving drug use on Navy ships in Long Beach have 
dropped dramatically since the early 1980s, when the Navy began conducting 
random drug tests on all of its vessels. He said, however, the military remains 
keenly aware that problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of sailors on the John A. Moore was launched by the ship's 
commanding officer, Cmdr. William Hickman, and involved the Naval Investigative 
Service, the civilian detective arm of the Navy, Chesser said. Hickman was out 
of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser would not provide details of the investigation, but he said some of the 
sailors are suspected of swapping urine samples "that might not be clean" for 
drug-free samples. The Navy tests its sailors randomly about three times a year 
for the use of six drugs, including the two drugs allegedly used by some of the 
sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser said at least one witness is present when sailors give urine samples, 
and various other regulations are supposed to be followed to ensure samples are 
not altered. Among the sailors suspected of tampering with the tests on the 
Long Beach frigate, he said, is the ship's master-at-arms, whose duties 
included supervising the testing program. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has forced the Navy to cancel at least one weekend mission at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman, the ship's commander, determined last month that it was unsafe to take 
the frigate from the naval station for a scheduled training mission because of 
the missing sailors, Chesser said. A substitute training session was held at 
the pier, he said.

SMALL GAS STATIONS MAY GET HELP COPING WITH TANKS THAT LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small gas station owners may get relief soon from regulations designed to 
protect underground water supplies from leaky storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new federal regulations, gas stations are required to test their 
underground storage tanks for leaks, replace any tanks that leak and install 
leak-detection systems. They are required also to buy at least $1 million in 
liability protection. And the station owner is responsible for cleaning up any 
soil that has been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Costs for testing and the insurance alone average $40,000 to $50,000 per 
location -- enough to threaten the existence of many mom-and-pop stations 
nationwide. Lenders have been reluctant to finance repairs because of the 
uncertainty over who pays for the cleanup if a station goes bankrupt. No lender 
wants to end up owning a station on a contaminated site. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by both the environmental implications of the leaks and the fate of 
small-station owners in his largely rural state, Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) has 
introduced the Underground Storage Tank Pollution Prevention and Assistance 
Program (HR 4319). 
</P>
<P>
Glickman has proposed expanding the use of an existing federal cleanup fund to 
provide market-rate loans to station owners complying with the anti-leak law. 
The legislation was designed to help rural gas station owners, but any business 
with 12 tanks or less in three locations or less would be eligible for aid 
under the program. 
</P>
<P>
"In my home state of Kansas, 95% of all UST (underground storage tank) owners 
have 12 tanks or less," Glickman said in introducing the measure. "There are 
20,000 tanks in Kansas, 100 of which are under investigation as major sites of 
leakage. Leaking tanks present a real threat to our health and environment. We 
must act to assist tank owners in cleaning up existing contamination of soil 
and ground water and protect against new leaks." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip R. Chisholm, executive vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Assn. 
of America, likes the proposal. "Rep. Glickman's legislation is definitely a 
move in the right direction, a good point of departure," he said. "What we 
would like to see done is opening up the trust fund for other purposes as well 
-- for example, to create a matching fund for stations so they will have enough 
money to do the cleanups." The bill is pending before both the House Energy and 
Commerce and Ways and Means committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing Parental Leave Bills Near Vote 
</P>
<P>
Just when they thought they had enough votes to pass a bill mandating parental 
leave, proponents fear that legislation introduced by Rep. Timothy J. Penny 
(D-Minn.) will undermine their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Penny plans to offer the Maternity Leave Act (HR 3445) as a substitute on the 
floor of the House of Representatives when the long-considered family-medical 
leave bill (HR 770) comes up for a vote within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The original bill, sponsored by Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and 150 
co-sponsors, would provide up to 15 weeks of medical leave over a one-year 
period for serious illness or injury and up to 10 weeks of parental leave over 
two years for birth, adoption or serious illness of a child or dependent 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
If it becomes law, the rules would apply immediately to businesses with 50 or 
more employees and in three years to employers with 35 or more workers. An 
employee would have to work a minimum of 20 hours a week to qualify for the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's bill has been opposed steadily over the years by most business 
trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National 
Federation of Independent Business. President Bush has promised to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
Penny views his bill as a compromise. It would provide 10 weeks of maternity 
leave for women -- except in the case of adoption, when it would include men -- 
and has no provisions for sick leave. "It's the only workable job security plan 
that can be embraced by all sides to this debate," Penny said in a letter to 
his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Schroeder and other supporters say maternity leave is not enough. 
"American families have no job protection if they need time to care for 
newborn, adopted or seriously ill children. This country needs a new minimum 
labor standard so that men and women don't have to choose between their jobs or 
their families." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Would Regulate Pensions 
</P>
<P>
Employers would face tough restrictions on their ability to reap surplus cash 
from employee pension plans under legislation approved by a Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is likely to 
intensify the debate between management and labor about who should benefit from 
excess assets earned by pension funds. Employers argue that they have the right 
to any funds above those required to pay the minimum defined benefits; labor 
contends that pensioners should share in the excess through increased benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The bill (S 685) would restrict an employer's ability to terminate an employee 
pension plan and substitute a lesser plan unless the plan's administrator 
determines that the change is in the best interests of the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless it is in the interests of the pension participants, companies will not 
be able to terminate pension plans to raid their so-called excess assets," said 
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who is sponsoring the bill along with Sen. 
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People With Disabilities Focus of Upcoming Bill 
</P>
<P>
The Americans With Disabilities Act (HR 2273) is expected to emerge from the 
House Public Works and Transportation Committee and move to the floor for a 
vote within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters refer to the legislation as a new civil rights bill for people with 
disabilities. Last fall, the Senate approved a similar measure by a wide 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill establishes "a clear and comprehensive prohibition of 
discrimination on the basis of disability" in employment, public 
accommodations, private businesses, public services, transportation and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
Although approval is also expected in the House, the bill will still face heavy 
opposition from some major business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
They claim, among other things, that the law is too vague for business to 
follow. "It lacks guidelines and parameters for business compliance," said the 
Chamber. "It is punitive and relies on lawsuits to encourage compliance, rather 
than conciliation."

ONE YEAR LATER, SO MANY ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE SEIZURE OF LINCOLN S&amp;L; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: EMPLOYEES AND BONDHOLDERS ARE AMONG THOSE STILL ENTANGLED IN THE DRAMA 
OF A FINANCIAL COLLAPSE.

<P>
"Trish," a dapper Charles H. Keating Jr. shouted out to a former employee he 
recognized recently at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A startled Patricia Johnson, the one-time aide whom he had unceremoniously 
fired a year earlier, looked up and saw her former boss. She shook hands with 
him, but not a word was spoken, not a smile flashed on either face. 
</P>
<P>
With the greeting made, she turned and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
The chance meeting nearly a year after the collapse of Keating's American 
Continental Corp. and its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan unit brought a rush of 
memories to Johnson. She liked Keating, she said, but the thrift's seizure last 
April 14 has made her life hell. 
</P>
<P>
It is a hell shared by other former employees, by Keating himself and his 
remaining aides, by thrift regulators and former regulators and, perhaps most 
strikingly, by thousands of small investors who lost more than $200 million 
related to the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based Lincoln, which lost $1 billion last year, is expected to become 
one of the most expensive thrift failures in history, costing taxpayers more 
than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, chairman of American Continental, used his Phoenix home-building 
company to buy Lincoln in early 1984 for $51 million. The S&amp;L grew to a 
$5.4-billion enterprise, with much of its deposits invested in real estate 
developments and in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Keating's empire has hurt a wide range of people. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 22,000 small investors, who bought what many believed were federally 
insured American Continental bonds sold in Lincoln branches, have filed 17 
lawsuits in state and federal courts against Keating, his aides and the lawyers 
and accountants who advised him. The investors now hold worthless paper. 
</P>
<P>
The political careers of five U.S. senators, including Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), are in jeopardy because they helped Lincoln while they were getting 
more than $1.3 million in campaign contributions and donations to pet projects 
from Keating and some 75 family members, associates and employees. The bulk of 
the money, nearly $900,000, went to Cranston and three nonpartisan voter 
registration groups he supported. 
</P>
<P>
While former American Continental and Lincoln employees have found it tough 
getting work, some of those who sold bonds at Lincoln branches are still 
working there and must face the anguish of the elderly bondholders who come in 
daily. Some Lincoln borrowers also were dragged down, forced into bankruptcy 
from a combination of debt, canceled deals with Lincoln and Arizona's depressed 
real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Keating himself has become the lightning rod for criticism of all the ills in 
the thrift industry. Last fall, regulators filed a $1.1-billion civil 
racketeering action against him and his top aides. He also could eventually 
face criminal charges from pending state and federal probes. 
</P>
<P>
The stories of some people whose lives were touched by the Lincoln scandal give 
a glimpse of the past year in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Publicist 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Johnson was Arizona's "Outstanding Young Democrat" in 1985 and, she 
thought, her liberal bent was the antithesis of Keating and his politics. She 
surprised herself in accepting Keating's offer of a job to handle American 
Continental's public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie was personable, charming, passionate about his company," she said, in 
explaining why she joined his firm. She said he was "well-centered 
politically," even though he often is mischaracterized as a conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, a few days before American Continental's bankruptcy, Keating told 
her he had to let her go -- no vacation or severance pay, though others had 
received generous parachutes. Her dismissal, she thought then, was dictated by 
regulators. It wasn't, she learned later. 
</P>
<P>
"A little panic set in," Johnson said. "How was I going to pay for groceries? I 
had just spent $400 over the weekend on flowers, plants, grass seed, fertilizer 
for the repossessed house I had bought. I wondered if I could take the flowers 
and grass back." 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a letter of recommendation that she wrote and Keating signed, she 
started an immediate job hunt. A well-known figure locally, Johnson found that 
doors normally open to her were now closed. 
</P>
<P>
When she did get in, she didn't get far. One banker ripped up the Keating 
letter in front of her and advised her not to show it to other prospective 
employers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind being rejected for professional reasons, but not to have an 
opportunity to interview because of my association with American Continental, 
that hurt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She started her own business as a consultant, but the accounts she could get 
were infrequent ones. "I felt like I had so much knowledge to offer and no work 
to use it on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Johnson went on unemployment. She borrowed money on her credit card 
and from her family. Her parents bought her groceries often. But mini-disasters 
hit regularly: She broke arm and leg bones in a bike accident, the roof on her 
home caved in after a rainstorm and her car broke down on the way to a job 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, her stint at American Continental haunted her. Last fall, 
Securities and Exchange Commission documents revealed that Keating and his 
aides blamed her for an erroneous press release in March, 1989, about the 
pending sale of Lincoln. But she had proof of her innocence -- Keating's own 
handwritten instructions on a draft of the press release. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, shortly after her bank account hit zero, Johnson, 36, started a 
new job with the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest. Still, she 
said, it will take "quite a while" to pay off her debts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Developer 
</P>
<P>
Ernest C. Garcia finds it hard to keep quiet. He usually is open and glib. The 
Phoenix real estate developer likes to tell reporters what's on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
But the whiz-kid entrepreneur -- he became a multimillionaire before he was 30 
-- has largely avoided discussing his entanglements with Lincoln. He invoked 
his 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination last month when 
subpoenaed to testify about those dealings before the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In my wildest imagination, I never dreamed I would plead the 5th to anything," 
Garcia, 32, said last week. "When is this nightmare going to end?" 
</P>
<P>
It appears no time soon. The Midas-touch businessman, who could seemingly do no 
wrong, is now fighting off creditors. He put his firm, E. C. Garcia &amp; Co., 
into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last week. 
</P>
<P>
Starting out as a stockbroker, Garcia founded his own firm in 1982. But he 
switched to the booming Arizona real estate market and quickly made a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
He sold 80% of his firm in 1986 to an Arizona utility but a year later decided 
he wanted it back. He turned to Keating to get a $20-million loan to buy the 
stock. The deal came with strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators contend that those strings -- purchases of raw land and securities 
owned by Lincoln -- made Garcia a puppet of Keating. In essence, Garcia was a 
straw borrower and a straw purchaser used by Keating to pump up Lincoln 
earnings, they claim in a pending federal lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who has cooperated with the alphabet soup of federal investigators, 
including the FBI and the SEC, said he was nobody's dupe. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we did made perfect business sense," he said. "Nobody tried to hide 
any deal from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Still, two weeks ago bondholders added his company to their pending lawsuits 
against Keating and others. Garcia said the unknown liability from that 
litigation, along with heavy debts incurred in his deals with Lincoln, forced 
him to turn to bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of all this, I'm as enthusiastic as ever and extremely confident in 
our abilities to succeed again," Garcia said. "But I won't look back at any 
time in the future and laugh about this. It's been brutal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Loyalist 
</P>
<P>
Danby Housel, 29, has worked for American Continental and Lincoln in Phoenix 
for 4 1/2 years. She has no plans to work anywhere else. The secretary said she 
will stick with Keating and American Continental through the coming battles 
with lawyers and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Starting out in the company's tax department, she fit the Keating employee look 
and demeanor -- young, well-scrubbed, good-looking, willing to work long hours. 
She liked the "very positive, very fast-paced" operation. "We always felt like 
a major part of the community in Phoenix," she said. "And there was such a 
camaraderie here." 
</P>
<P>
Though working mainly for Lincoln last year, she was handling a job for 
American Continental when the company filed for bankruptcy and regulators 
seized the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big shock. Everybody was totally bewildered," Housel said. "American 
Continental was big, then everything was wiped away. It took months to sink 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Though regulators offered her a job at Lincoln, she quit to work at a law firm. 
Two months later, she rejoined American Continental because she liked the 
company and was familiar with the work. She also returned, she said, because "I 
wanted to put my two cents in with the fight." 
</P>
<P>
She remains fervently loyal to Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my friends thought Keating was the biggest crook of all time. Others 
thought he was getting the short end of the stick," Housel said. "There have 
been a few battles (with friends). So we either call a truce or decide to stop 
seeing each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
Michael Manning does not consider himself an easy mark. But when federal 
regulators went looking for someone to investigate wrongdoing at Lincoln and 
American Continental, they said the choice of who could pursue such a complex 
case was easy. 
</P>
<P>
Last April 10, Manning, a Kansas City lawyer based in Washington, had just 
completed five years of work on the massive brokered deposit fraud perpetrated 
on 153 financial institutions by Mario Renda of New York. Manning was planning 
a vacation when an FDIC lawyer called to ask him to take charge of the Lincoln 
investigation after the planned seizure later that week. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring he would go to Phoenix for a few days and then oversee the case from 
his Washington office where he was managing partner, Manning agreed. He hasn't 
left Phoenix yet, and he no longer plans to. 
</P>
<P>
His firm has opened an office in Phoenix, and he has moved his family into 
town. The change has been a tough adjustment on his wife and three children. 
His second child, a 4-year-old daughter, complains that she "wants to go back 
to her own country," Manning said. His wife was not thrilled with the notion of 
moving to Phoenix but now likes it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Washington, I would come home at 10:30 at night and be asked to go to the 
store, and I'd be standing in a long line at the check-out counter," he said. 
"Here, I could come home at 8, go out to pick up some groceries and have the 
store to myself." 
</P>
<P>
In poring through Lincoln records, Manning, 40, said he saw many of the same 
kinds of transactions -- such as loans to straw borrowers who had no intention 
of repaying the debts -- that he saw in the Renda and other fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
He and other lawyers in his firm worked nonstop through most of the summer to 
put together a 167-page, $1.1-billion civil lawsuit accusing Keating and others 
of racketeering, bank fraud and other wrongdoing. The case was filed in 
September in U.S. District Court in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, this is a large and complex case," he said. "And the allegations 
don't center on a single bank fraud technique, as they usually do in other 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
Manning will likely amend the suit soon to add more defendants and more 
allegations. Trial is tentatively set for the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Bondholder 
</P>
<P>
Clifford H. Hammer became one of California's suddenly wealthy when he and his 
wife, Thelma, sold their Palos Verdes Estates home a little over two years ago 
and put a down payment on a smaller residence in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
A retiree from Southern California Edison Co., Hammer figured they could live 
comfortably on his pension and the $260,000 equity from the sale of their home. 
They even began to travel around the country, something they had always 
promised themselves they would do. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 73 and recovering from a recent back operation, Hammer has gone back to 
work. And it's not by choice. 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other Lincoln depositors who had been persuaded by thrift 
tellers and American Continental salespeople, Hammer put all of his savings 
into the parent company's debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
He received $2,600 a month, and retirement was grand. At least until last 
April, when the company filed for bankruptcy. Now the Hammers hold worthless 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife came down with shingles last May," he said. "It was caused by nerves, 
worrying about our loss. She was in the hospital about three days, and she 
still has it to some extent." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer said his back hurt, but he "had to go back into real estate" last May, 
something he had dabbled in part time before he retired 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no other way to get out of it," he said. "We've got a house payment 
and an insurance payment, and we were going into the red." 
</P>
<P>
But his back grew worse and he could hardly walk. So he underwent surgery three 
weeks ago to remove calcium deposits on his spine. Though he hasn't made a sale 
this year, he plans to return to work in four weeks. The alternative, he said, 
is to sell his retirement house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Kingfish 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr. publicly has been painted as the villain, the man in the 
black hat who allegedly masterminded a scam that led to the collapse of 
Lincoln. Thousands of bondholders believe it; government regulators believe it; 
some former employees believe it. 
</P>
<P>
But Keating, the 67-year-old chairman of American Continental, sees himself as 
a victim, not a villain. 
</P>
<P>
"History is replete with good people ruined by governments," he said with 
characteristic defiance. 
</P>
<P>
And Keating puts on an upbeat face. He refuses to let his long battles with 
regulators get him down. He believes completely that he will be vindicated. And 
he expects to get some Lincoln assets back so he can rebuild his company and 
pay off bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not despondent or despairing," Keating said. "It's a challenge, like the 
rest of life, that we intend to meet. It's not easy, but I'm not going to let 
it get me down." 
</P>
<P>
Keating anticipated the takeover of Lincoln last April 14. He braced for it, 
saying he already had "spent four years in living hell with regulators" in 
constant battle over Lincoln's operations. 
</P>
<P>
Always quick with rhetoric to blast regulators, Keating said his wife and 
children are strong people who are coping well because they know what 
regulators have done. "They understand vermin when they see it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said his net worth is zero. His Paradise Valley, Ariz., home is 
"mortgaged for way more than it's worth," but his creditors have given him 
until this summer to start making payments. 
</P>
<P>
A practicing lawyer before he got involved in finance and real estate in Ohio 
in the early 1970s, Keating said he is going back to the law. He plans to open 
an office in Phoenix next month with some of his family members and longtime 
American Continental associates. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to practice in federal courts around the nation," he said. "I've got 
an office set up to practice business law, particularly for cases related to 
government affairs. I'll represent those who are similarly harassed by the 
government. I think it will do quite well."

PERSONAL FINANCE: PROTECT YOUR CREDIT CARDS FROM RETAIL PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time you write a check and the sales clerk writes your credit card number 
on it as identification, you are subjecting yourself to possible fraud. And 
every time a sales clerk writes your home phone or address on the sales slip 
when you use your credit card, you are leaving yourself open to an invasion of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Several states, consumer groups and retailers are moving to make these 
practices unnecessary or illegal. 
</P>
<P>
If you're like most people, you probably have not thought much about giving 
your credit card number whenever you buy something by check. It's needed for 
identification or in case your check bounces, you've probably reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
But to the extent that your check now contains your name, address, home phone 
number and credit card number, it could be used by an unscrupulous person to 
apply for credit in your name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very common in department stores to give a person instant credit merely 
after presenting an existing credit card or a credit card number," says Elgie 
Holstein, executive director of Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group. 
Thus, anybody with a copy of your check could apply for credit at a store under 
your name, go on a shopping spree and leave you with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time this misrepresentation is detected, a consumer's credit history 
may have suffered severe damage," says California Assemblyman Rusty Areias 
(D-Los Banos), who has introduced a bill in the state Legislature to ban the 
practice of writing a credit card number on a check. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it turns out, there is really no justification for a retailer to write 
your credit card number on your check, Holstein and Areias say. That is because 
credit card firms such as Visa and MasterCard prohibit retailers from charging 
purchases to a credit card to cover a bounced check. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, several states, including Maine and Iowa, have passed legislation 
banning retailers from requiring a credit card as identification before 
accepting a check. Areias' bill, modeled after those other laws, is given a 
good chance of passage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some retailers -- including some stores in the Bloomingdale's and 
Limited Inc. chains -- no longer require clerks to write credit card numbers on 
checks, Holstein says. 
</P>
<P>
Another practice that has also peeved consumer groups and some lawmakers is 
retailers asking for and writing down your telephone number or address on a 
credit card sales slip when you use plastic to buy goods or services. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers claim that they need this information as protection in case the sales 
clerk doesn't get a clear imprint from the card on the sales slip. If that 
happens, the store likely will lose the revenue from the sale because it won't 
be able to bill you. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't want our privacy invaded just because a clerk makes a mistake," 
Holstein says. 
</P>
<P>
Holstein argues that in many cases, protection against bad imprints is not the 
real reason merchants want that information anyway. As it turns out, he says, 
many retailers collect addresses and phone numbers of customers and sell them 
to direct-mail specialists or use them for in-house marketing purposes. You 
could find yourself getting a slew of unwelcome junk catalogues or phone calls 
from fast-talking salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart of this problem is that the credit card has become a form of 
national ID card . . . used in ways for which they were never intended and 
which in some cases are specifically prohibited by credit card companies," 
Holstein says. 
</P>
<P>
Holstein notes that Visa, MasterCard and American Express ban merchants who 
accept their cards from refusing a sale to a customer solely because that 
consumer declines to provide a home phone number or other personal information. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you must provide your address and home phone to the card issuer when you 
apply for credit, so there really is no need for the retailer to request this 
information, Holstein argues. And if the merchant follows proper procedures, it 
should be guaranteed payment by the card company anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Areias also has introduced legislation that would ban this practice in 
California, modeled after legislation in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO DEAL WITH RETAILER RULES 
</P>
<P>
What recourse do you have if a sales clerk insists on writing your credit card 
number on your personal check, or your phone number on a credit card sales 
slip? 
</P>
<P>
The Bankcard Holders of America offers the following tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Talk it over. Ask the clerk -- or the store manager -- why the store requires 
this unnecessary information. Explain your rights and explain how they are 
subjecting you to potential fraud or an invasion of your privacy. 
</P>
<P>
* Suggest a compromise. If all the store really wants is backup ID, suggest 
that the clerk write on your check the expiration date of your credit card -- 
but not the card number itself -- as verification that you presented a credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
* Get a Consumer Action Card. This card, along with a pamphlet, outlines your 
rights and can be presented to a clerk at time of purchase. It's available for 
$1 from the Bankcard Holders of America, 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, 
Herndon, Va. 22070. 
</P>
<P>
* Complain. Report the store by writing to Visa, MasterCard or American 
Express. 
</P>
<P>
"When people stand up for their rights, in most cases the managers will waive 
the policy," says Elgie Holstein of Bankcard Holders of America, noting that 
some 50,000 people have already written to request his group's Consumer Action 
Card. Merchants, he notes, once were hesitant to give consumers the carbons 
from credit card sales slips -- until enough consumers complained.

DESPITE TURMOIL, SOME JUNK BOND ISSUERS OK

While junk bonds have recently accompanied a succession of companies down the 
road to ruin, there continues to be evidence that the low-rated, high-yield 
paper can help build healthy businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Among the junk-funded companies that are looking good to bond analysts: 
</P>
<P>
* Vons Cos., the El Monte-based supermarket chain, is carrying about $839 
million in debt but last month reported its first net profit in more than a 
year and appears to be getting stronger. The company, No. 1 ranked in Southern 
California with a 25% market share, took on heavy debts when it bought 162 
former Safeway Stores 20 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
* McCaw Cellular, one of two big players in the mobile phone business, has $1.7 
billion in long-term debt and junk bonds that yield a sobering 17%. But the 
company's asset values are high, particularly after its recent acquisition of 
Lin Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
* MCI Communications, the long-distance phone company, used a $3-billion Drexel 
Burnham Lambert junk issue to raise money to build the world's first 
fiber-optic telephone network. It has a 12% share in the long-distance market, 
and earnings have been at record levels. 
</P>
<P>
* Turner Broadcasting System, Ted Turner's cable-TV and entertainment company, 
took on heavy debts during the 1980s to finance the purchase of the MGM movie 
library. But with the Cable News Network and the TBS cable network doing well, 
the company has restructured debts so that the average TBS bond interest rate 
is 10.9%, down from 14.5%. 
</P>
<P>
* Levi Strauss, the jeans maker, was led back to financial health with help 
from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. junk bonds. The San Francisco company's bonds are 
today trading above par, in sharp contrast to most of their junk brethren. 
</P>
<P>
* Kroger, the nation's No. 2 supermarket chain, restructured in 1988 to elude 
an attempted takeover by the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. buyout firm. But 
though it took on debt of $5.5 billion, including $1.9 billion in junk, 
analysts consider it a more efficient company today.

CAN A LINGUIST FIND LOVE?; 
</P>
<P>
THE FULL CATASTROPHE BY DAVID CARKEET (THE LINDEN PRESS: $18.95; 317 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Nolan, Nolan writes the Mister Los Angeles column in Los Angeles 
Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This fourth novel by David Carkeet is the funniest book I've read in 
five-and-a-half years. 
</P>
<P>
"The Full Catastrophe," a comic chronicle of marital misunderstandings, is 
eccentric, hilarious, wildly inventive and eerily accurate. It's the sort of 
zany social satire that hasn't been encountered much since the '60s, when 
wickedly word-perfect reporters such as Bruce Jay Friedman, Jordan Crittenden, 
Terry Southern and Charles Webb roamed the suburbs. In some passages, Carkeet 
harks back even further, to classic humorists like Stephen Leacock and Robert 
Benchley. 
</P>
<P>
Carkeet seems to make a habit of producing remarkable volumes. His first 
effort, "Double Negative," a murder mystery set in a linguistics think tank, 
was nominated for an Edgar by the Mystery Writers of America. A baseball novel 
called "The Greatest Slump of All Time" was his second book, and it won raves 
from such sports and literary buffs as Larry King. "I Been There Before," 
Carkeet's third novel, had Mark Twain returning to Earth in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
For "The Full Catastrophe," Carkeet brings back Jeremy Cook, the linguist 
introduced in "Double Negative." Thirty-two, unmarried, ignorant of most 
contemporary popular culture, Cook (author of "The Woof of Words," a 
"surprisingly popular general introduction to linguistics") sees everything 
through the quirky tunnel vision of his academic specialty. 
</P>
<P>
A baseball score card looks to him like "a lost astronaut's daily log." Meals 
are necessary chores, like trips to the gas station. Social encounters are 
exercises in avoiding "the extremes of pushiness and passivity," and 
conviviality requires "a zero information flow." 
</P>
<P>
Cook is seeking employment in St. Louis as the book begins. He quickly finds 
work at the Pillow Agency, an odd outfit that specializes in serving "the 
linguistically troubled marriage." Pillow agents actually reside in the homes 
of couples seeking help. They serve as sort of live-in therapists, following 
guidelines set down in the often enigmatic Pillow Manual. 
</P>
<P>
Beth and Dan Wilson are the marrieds that Cook is assigned to. Beth teaches, 
Dan works (unhappily) at a printing business owned by Beth's family. They have 
a 10-year-old son, Robbie. Humming with low-level anxiety, Cook inserts himself 
into their daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he uses his linguistic knowledge to sort out grammatical 
misunderstandings. His first night in the house, Cook is able to point to a 
wrangle over the use of our that never would have ensnared 7th-Century English 
speakers, who employed a dual pronoun number. And he heightens Beth's and Dan's 
awareness of the tension-producing "complementary schismogenesis" that 
inexorably builds when they simultaneously engage in mutually exclusive 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
But to begin with, he mostly observes. It's speech, verbal and physical, that 
captures Cook's attention. "What else was there but language?" he muses. 
"Everything was a linguistic question these days. And if it wasn't, he'd make 
it one." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his off-kilter sensibilities, everything Cook scrutinizes attains a 
heightened fun-house reality. Cook is like the rhetorical man from another 
planet who stares in astonishment at the "normal" behavior of Earthlings. Seen 
through his alien eyes, the ordinary takes on a farcical dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who's ever listened to or participated in a linguistically oriented 
argument -- where both parties try to clarify and assign blame about what was 
said, and end up getting even angrier -- can wince in recognition and laugh out 
loud (an example of self-contained "complementary schismogenesis"?) at Dan's 
and Beth's circular tirades. 
</P>
<P>
Some excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
"It started with the way you approached the whole thing. The way you yelled up 
the stairs that our summer was ruined." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh come on . . . I was upset. Okay?" 
</P>
<P>
"You said it like it was all suddenly my responsibility -- " 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"Like you were saying, 'Our summer is ruined, and it's your job to make it 
better.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mean that at all!" 
</P>
<P>
"But it felt like that's what you meant." 
</P>
<P>
"Well I didn't, okay? How many times do I have to -- " 
</P>
<P>
"Okay okay. Anyway, my point is the way you brought it up got us off to a 
horrible start." 
</P>
<P>
"How should I talk? Can't I say what I feel?" 
</P>
<P>
Such round-robins have led Beth and Dan Wilson to the brink of divorce. It's 
Cook's job to keep them from stepping over. As his therapy becomes more 
aggressive, Jeremy searches for "The Horror" that, according to Pillow Agency 
lore, lurks at the heart of this (and every) marriage. 
</P>
<P>
It all came down to "one simple question," Cook concludes: "What possessed two 
intelligent people of good will to snarl at each other like jackals over a 
carcass? Didn't they both want the marriage to thrive?" 
</P>
<P>
Threading through all this is the linguist's own yearning for a successful 
interpersonal relationship. Goaded by Mr. Pillow, the head of the agency (a 
character even quirkier than Cook himself), Jeremy endures a series of blind 
dates designed to find a replacement for Paula, the student linguist for whom 
he may or may not still be carrying a torch. 
</P>
<P>
What is "The Horror"? Do Dan and Beth achieve parity together? Can Jeremy 
himself discover happiness? 
</P>
<P>
Read this terrific book and find out.

THE HORSE LATITUDES BY ROBERT FERRIGNO (WILLIAM MORROW: $18.95; 288 PP.; 
0-688-09060-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Aram Saroyan, Saroyan's books include The Romantics, Last Rites and Trio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jacket blurb for "The Horse Latitudes" by Robert Ferrigno, a newspaper 
feature writer, tells us that the book "brilliantly subsumes the conventions of 
noir literature." And from the beginning, it's true, there's no mistaking the 
mood indigo of Danny DiMedici, a retired dope dealer who pines for his ex-wife, 
Lauren Keil: "There were nights when Danny missed Lauren so bad that he wanted 
to take a fat man and throw him through a plate-glass window." 
</P>
<P>
Lauren, brainy as well as beautiful, is still out in the fast lane leading 
cutting-edge seminars for executives and scientists while Danny idles in a 
rented apartment in Newport Beach with a phony fireplace. Having had to kill a 
man, he's lost his appetite for dealing. But don't be fooled, he still has the 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
When a dealer pal asks him to keep a Samoan bodyguard occupied, he stops just 
short of killing the guy. It's a good fight scene, both of them slipping on the 
oil that happens to be on the pavement beside the Samoan's car. Later, Danny 
notices his foot hurts from kicking the man and reflects that he's getting too 
old for this kind of work. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a murder. A scientist involved in genetic experiments that employ 
fresh human fetuses has been discovered strung up and maimed in Lauren's 
stylish, blood-spattered beach house, and Lauren can't be found. There are a 
lot of subsidiary characters, including twin body builders named Boyd and 
Lloyd, both of them murderous morons. And there's an old detective near 
retirement named Steiner who comes close to walking away with the book. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno is a skillful writer, good with dialogue, who occasionally skimps in 
setting a scene so the reader experiences a sort of prose jump-out. But the 
real problem with "The Horse Latitudes" is that Danny isn't revealed deeply 
enough to provide a narrative center of gravity. This is rather a designer noir 
novel where the bodies and the clothes, the cars and the food, the sex and the 
dope, the fine furniture and all the fancy talk stand in for the pleasures of a 
story that actively plumbs its depths. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the trouble seems to be that Ferrigno's journalistic instincts 
undercut those of the novelist in him. For example, as he tracks the thoughts 
of Det. Steiner's female partner, Jane Holt, we learn that "Newport Beach was 
affluent, educated and white, a quiet, button-down community with three Ferrari 
dealerships and no public transportation. The supermarkets stocked Black Forest 
truffles and Dom Perignon, and commodities fraud was more common than murder . 
. . " -- which is straight reportage in the guise of a character's thought 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider that late in the book Danny visits a local cafe, and we learn more 
about the life of its proprietor, Grace, than we know about virtually any other 
character -- and she doesn't appear again. We never find out where Danny comes 
from, who his parents are or where he was educated. The book is all 
high-resolution front-story, and any back-story remains opaque. The scenes 
unfold like animate panels in a hip comic-strip. There's no depth of field. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, perhaps, "The Horse Latitudes" doesn't have much narrative 
momentum. Much of the action takes place off-stage. With all the elements in 
place for a high-tech thriller, the book dissolves into an oddly desultory 
Southern California travelogue cum character study with the moments of intimacy 
few and far between. Danny regrets his murder, yearns for Lauren and moves from 
scene to scene, from person to person, with a querulous aplomb that seems to 
lie on top of a couple of burning questions that never get asked. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the book, Danny and Lauren briefly discuss the loss of one's moral 
compass while on drugs. Lauren tells him: "Because of the drugs, I was 
exploring a different moral and logical universe. . . . " Danny has his own 
memory of "a shimmy of right and wrong, good and bad. In that room, on that 
morning, it . . . made sense." 
</P>
<P>
It seems a shame Ferrigno didn't pull out all his stops and try to fully render 
the moral valences implicit in such a moment. His skill indicates that he might 
have brought it off, and it's exactly what this book needs: a highly charged 
novelistic epiphany involving moment-to-moment psychology and perception; who 
as opposed to all the insistent what. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too, the experience of temporary alchemy with irreversible consequences 
might just be the real noir behind this book's high black gloss.

Drawing, Jean Cocteau, "The Split/Each Time." From "The Visual Art of Jean 
Cocteau" (International Archive of Art/Harry N. Abrams: $49.50; 219 pp.; color 
illustrations throughout), edited by Marshall Lee, text by William A. Emboden, 
introduction by Tony Clark. Cocteau (1889-1963) has been known principally for 
his work in theater, film and literature. Recently, however, a notable 
collection of Cocteau's work in the visual arts, the Severin Wunderman 
collection, has been installed in a museum in Irvine. This volume, with a text 
by the museum's director, presents that collection and the artist's life in 
tandem.

IF YOU WERE A DANCE, WHAT DANCE WOULD YOU BE?; 
</P>
<P>
DANCERS &amp; THE DANCE STORIES BY SUMMER BRENNER (COFFEE HOUSE PRESS: $9.95, 
PAPER; 160 PP.; 0-918273-75-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sasha Anawalt, Anawalt was, for five years, dance critic for the Los Angeles 
Herald Examiner. At present, she is the critic for KCRW (89.9 FM) National 
Public Radio in Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wisdom of the body is Summer Brenner's terrain. She is the author as 
choreographer, a moving force with a pen. In "Dancers &amp; the Dance," her 
recent collection of short stories, she tries to elucidate the interior rhythm 
of characters, their dreams, their private dance. Twelve distinct portraits 
emerge from the poetic hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner writes from experience. She studied flamenco and modern dance at 
length, and has taught and performed both disciplines. She is not a household 
name in dance, yet her savvy is apparent in the realistic descriptions she 
gives of dance idioms, of ballet studios and their inimitable smell of sweat. 
Brenner lives in Berkeley and is recognized as a poet and fiction writer on the 
small-press circuit. Her last novella was "The Soft Room." 
</P>
<P>
An extensive or even cursory knowledge of dance is not a prerequisite for 
picking up "Dancers &amp; the Dance." In Brenner's imagination, everyone is a 
dancer. We all apply. She reduces the reader to the common denominator, 
sometimes to her disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
She does likewise with her characters, presuming a blank slate. They begin as 
one-dimensional. They are simple people faced with a single problem. Putting 
her ear to their skins, as it were, Brenner works backwards into their 
emotional life. She listens for the beat, the beat of what incites them to make 
concrete choices: the rock 'n' roll dancer named Alto who throws his guitar 
over the edge of a bluff; the flamenco dancer who walks into the San Francisco 
Bay after giving the performance of her life; the prepossessing teen who at the 
prom assumes her divorced mother's mistrust of men. 
</P>
<P>
Each has a particular dance that Brenner labels "rock 'n' roll" or "flamenco" 
or "ballroom," but what she's really after is the metaphor of that dance for 
their life. How she accomplishes the tough task is admirable, if sometimes 
callow. 
</P>
<P>
"That was rock 'n' roll. Alto clutched the steering wheel like an arm of a 
girl. He moved it around the dance floor in his mind as if they'd been dancing 
together for years," she writes of the rock 'n' roller. 
</P>
<P>
But Brenner's ultimate aim is to remove the persona from the body altogether 
and send that persona out into an abstract jungle of language. Her memorable 
characters leave the realm of prose for poetry. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the stronger stories, "The Belly Dancer," she describes the dancers 
thus: "Their sight was blurred by a unified vision of matter passing into 
light, their bodies passing into an uncommon state, an unusual suspension, more 
fluid than solid." 
</P>
<P>
Or again, in an exciting passage that accurately captures the feeling of what 
it is like to perform, she says of the flamenco dancer: "Simultaneously absent 
and present, the music had driven her out of her body and all those devouring 
eyes, those strange and unknown faces, had filled her empty tenement.". 
</P>
<P>
Brenner is asking that old question: "Can you separate the dancer from the 
dance?" If you cannot tell the two apart, that is a good sign. The performance 
is beyond average, extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The same rule might apply to Brenner in "Dancers &amp; the Dance," whose 
stories can be succinctly divided between the majestic and the infantile, the 
seamless and the cliche-ridden. In fact, it's hard to believe the same person 
could have written such widely divergent portrayals as Sonny in "The African 
Dancer" and Anne in "The Converted Dancer." 
</P>
<P>
Sonny is a white woman who has a mulatto child. She takes on the cause of black 
people and moves to Oakland, where the Black Panthers lived. She wants to be 
black. By dancing, she is removed from her color. "Sister, you sho don't dance 
white," says a stranger of Sonny. An involving story on its own, "The African 
Dancer" is further bolstered by a rhythmic device. Brenner breaks her 
paragraphs apart with the "whap, wha, wha, wha, whap" sound of the drums in 
Sonny's dance class. The aural representation serves to make the story read 
with the pronounced impulses of African motion. We can better imagine what it 
must be like to be Sonny. In the alert and credible stories, Brenner makes this 
attempt to incorporate the rhythm of the dance form about which she is writing. 
"The Flamenco Dancer" alternates performing scenes from the stage with 
restaurant scenes from daily life. The timing of cuts is like the underlying 
beat of the Flamenco dancers' clapping hands. 
</P>
<P>
But in "The Converted Dancer," "The Ballet Dancer" and "The Modern Dancer," 
Brenner's writing is loose and immature. High on simplistic similes strung 
together at close proximity, Brenner reveals that she is not as confident when 
writing about young women and particularly men. What she seems to understand is 
the mature, sensual, earthy woman. 
</P>
<P>
To her credit, a keen twist of plot in the final paragraph usually salvages the 
most undeveloped of her stories. She knows how to craft a work. And, like a 
vibrant dancer, she knows how to make us believe that the closing image is the 
one we'll remember. It almost works.

THE WHOLE WORLD IS ARMENIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aram Saroyan's tribute, "A Father, a Son and a Beautiful White Horse" (Book 
Review, April 1), evokes memories of the lifelong achievements of his father, 
the incorrigible William Saroyan. Until Saroyan's appearance on the literary 
scene, Armenia and Armenians were virtually unknown entities, as those of us of 
Armenian heritage will attest. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the earthquake of December, 1988, revived interest in "this race, 
this small tribe of unimportant people" as Saroyan once described them. 
</P>
<P>
But decades before this catastrophe, it was Saroyan, this waif from Fresno, who 
saluted the very existence of Armenians as a people. "There are times when the 
whole world is Armenian," he once exclaimed with his usual exuberance. To 
Saroyan, the secret of Armenia's survival is summarized in a powerful 
acclamation which ends: "For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see 
if they will not create a New Armenia."

Re Robert Ward's April 1 review of Ian Hamilton's "Writers in Hollywood," I 
hasten to decline my share of a well-intentioned compliment. 
</P>
<P>
In my not-so-humble opinion, it was director Alexander Mackendrick who was the 
chief creative driving force behind the film "Sweet Smell of Success." It was 
his brilliance as director that gave the picture whatever qualities it has that 
have elicited praise over the years. And apparently neither author Hamilton nor 
reviewer Ward is aware that Mackendrick is the distinguished director of, among 
others, two British film classics: "Tight Little Island" and "The Man in the 
White Suit."

WHY THEY WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT AIDS;

<TEXT>
<P>
Atlanta. 1982. Dr. Donald Francis, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease 
Control, is growing increasingly impatient over the federal government's 
failure to properly fund work on a new but ominous disease. 
</P>
<P>
As his frustration mounts, he begins calling the New York Times, the Washington 
Post and other media outlets, talking to reporters who had interviewed him 
during his pioneering work on smallpox and other major medical stories. Francis 
figures a few well-placed stories about his lack of resources -- there isn't 
even enough money to buy basic lab supplies or to put doors on makeshift 
offices -- will force the Reagan Administration to act. But to his astonishment 
and chagrin, Francis can't get a single reporter interested. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me it wasn't a news story," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It" would soon have a name, though -- AIDS -- and in time, "it" would become 
very much a news story, a national tragedy responsible for tens of thousands of 
deaths. Francis' early experience -- with the Reagan Administration and the 
media alike -- was, however, all too typical of the prevailing attitude toward 
AIDS in the United States in 1982 (and in 1983, 1984 and most of 1985 as well). 
AIDS was "their" disease -- it was, after all, initially known as GRID 
(Gay-Related Infectious Disease) -- and few editors or politicians were 
terribly concerned about it, not in a country still largely uncomfortable with, 
if not downright hostile toward homosexuality (vide Andy Rooney, Middle 
America's foolosopher-in-residence, just this year). 
</P>
<P>
With a few notable exceptions, the American media didn't cover AIDS in any 
meaningful way until it seemed to threaten "normal" (i.e., heterosexual) men 
and women . . . and their children. When an erroneous story in a respected 
medical journal suggested in the spring of 1983 that AIDS could be spread by 
"casual contact" -- that "children living in high-risk households are 
susceptible to AIDS . . . (without) sexual contact, drug abuse or exposure to 
blood products," a media-feeding frenzy immediately ensued. Then, just as 
quickly, it faded -- until Rock Hudson died in October, 1985. Then, as USA 
Today editorialized -- its irony seemingly unintended -- "With Hudson's death, 
many of us are realizing that AIDS is not a 'gay plague' but everybody's 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Media coverage of AIDS more than tripled in the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Hudson was the first person with AIDS whom we all "knew and cared about," says 
George Strait, medical reporter for ABC network news. That connection -- "at 
once personal and impersonal" -- became the "most important agenda-setter of 
all" for the media, writes James Kinsella in his insightful new book. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsella, former editorial-page editor at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, 
provides a detailed, damning account of media insensitivity, indifference and 
ignorance, of media squeamishness and sensationalism throughout the early 
months and years of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times? Kinsella says AIDS was "virtually ignored for years by what 
is arguably America's journal of record," largely because A. M. Rosenthal, then 
executive editor of the paper, was widely thought by his reporters and 
subordinate editors to be homophobic. No AIDS story appeared on Page 1 of the 
New York Times until May 25, 1983 -- by which time more than 500 people already 
had died of the disease in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The networks? ABC, CBS and NBC combined devoted 13 minutes to AIDS in the 
entire year of 1982, and as late as 1985, the only way George Strait could get 
the words anal sex on the air was to ask Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National 
Institutes of Health to use them in an interview. Kinsella writes about media 
coverage of AIDS in small cities like Kokomo, Ind.; Arcadia, Fla., and 
Mesquite, Tex., as well as in such big cities as New York and San Francisco, 
and he repeatedly comes to the same conclusion -- that the quality of coverage 
almost invariably depended on the quality, the commitment and the courage of 
the individual journalist. Not that Kinsella automatically praises those 
journalists who wrote early and often on AIDS. Some of these journalists saw 
themselves as educators, and Kinsella argues that the educator-reporter "may be 
a laudable paradigm, but it's not really what journalism is about. The basis of 
the craft is telling a story you happened to hear, and that somehow touched 
your own life so significantly that you want to share it with another." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. And yet it is also true that the journalists whom Kinsella most 
praises for their AIDS work -- Laurie Garrett, formerly of National Public 
Radio; Art Kern and Jim Bunn of television station KPIX in San Francisco; 
Robert Bazell of NBC -- did indeed serve as reporters cum educators on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some of the best AIDS reporting at times came perilously close to being 
not just education but advocacy -- crusading -- and while Kinsella is even more 
critical of that stance, he never fully comes to terms with the 
incontrovertible fact that were it not for the educators, advocates and 
crusaders in the press corps, the record of the media would have been even more 
appalling than it already was on this story. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Randy Shilts -- who provided the most comprehensive early coverage of the 
epidemic for the San Francisco Chronicle and subsequently wrote the powerful 
book "And the Band Played On" -- clearly engaged in some unprofessional 
behavior in pursuit of the story. Kinsella rightly chastises him for that. But 
Shilts' stories, alerting San Francisco gays to the new dangers of promiscuous 
sex, probably saved hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives by helping to "tame 
the voracious sexual appetites of many gay men in San Francisco," as Kinsella 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
Would Shilts' reporting have been as powerful -- and as effective -- had he 
not, as a gay man in San Francisco, become so personally committed to AIDS 
coverage? Is it possible for a reporter to have both professional detachment 
and personal commitment on a story? These are interesting and provocative 
questions, and Kinsella grapples with them but doesn't ultimately provide 
satisfactory answers. 
</P>
<P>
His book succeeds as a journalistic account of journalistic failure; it's less 
successful exploring the moral and ethical dilemmas of the journalist. Perhaps 
that's not surprising. Kinsellas is a working journalist, not a social 
philosopher.

IS L.A. A WORLD -CLASS ART CITY; 
</P>
<P>
PONDERING THE QUESTION THAT BECOME A CLICHE. L.A. HAS MATURED, BUT THERE'S 
STILL A WAYS TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The claim gets made with almost metronomic regularity, but is it true? Is Los 
Angeles really "a world-class city" for art? 
</P>
<P>
Let's put the short answer this way: As long as there's an irresistible need to 
assert that it is, it probably isn't. Naked boosterism is fine for the Chamber 
of Commerce and elected officials, whose honest duty it is enthusiastically to 
champion the people who keep them in business. But it's deadly for culture, 
which gets inadvertently trampled under the cheerleaders' stomping feet. 
</P>
<P>
The long answer is -- well, longer, more complex. Art of a caliber equal to 
that produced anywhere is certainly made here, and has been at least since 
1911, the year Edward Weston set up his photography studio in Glendale. But 
that doesn't mean the cultural life of the city has long been distinguished. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase "world-class city," which came into vogue in the push toward the 
1984 Olympic Games, is sound-bite shorthand for cosmopolitanism -- a rather 
more intimidating term. And cosmopolitan is indeed what Los Angeles is in the 
feverish throes of becoming. Today, the city is straddled between worldliness 
and its numbing inverse, the deep-seated provincialism that long ago made it 
the Official National Joke in matters cultural. For art, the dilemma couldn't 
be more important. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STATURE. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmopolitanism, or worldliness, is an elusive subject. Because it's 
essentially an inclination or a mental attitude, a way of thinking and 
behaving, it resists by-the-numbers calculation. That's why the people who 
incessantly tabulate and tout the square footage -- the endlessly subdividing 
County Museum of Art, the two-venue Museum of Contemporary Art, the overstuffed 
Norton Simon Museum, the gigantic (and unbuilt) J. Paul Getty Center, assorted 
private foundations -- as the surest sign of world-class stature are hopeless. 
Pridefully pointing fingers at the burgeoning number of museums is, in fact, a 
sign of lingering provincial insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
Museums are certainly consequential. As social spaces in which the prospect of 
sensual gratification is condensed, they're great places in which to have 
private epiphanies in public. (Museums gained a reputation for being great 
pick-up spots because they reek of this intoxicating atmosphere.) Art's 
identities are always changing, and those identities don't take shape in 
isolation. Museums, as culture's clubhouses, can bring a variety of social and 
artistic forces together as a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
When regarded chiefly as emblems of civic accomplishment and distinction, 
however, this socially interactive, clubhouse function gets narcissistically 
transformed: The museum becomes a private looking glass in which we unsociably 
admire our own beneficent reflection. 
</P>
<P>
To identify with your city by identifying with its real estate is a common, 
even wildly popular, pastime. The national paradigm is currently Donald Trump, 
whose galloping career has been built by shamelessly exploiting the vulgar 
power of precisely this anti-social juvenility. He wants you to be seduced, out 
there along Wilshire Boulevard, by the prospect of seeing your ego reflected in 
the world's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
Vanity is not the problem. (Who isn't, in some small way, vain?) The source of 
the pride is. 
</P>
<P>
In a cosmopolitan milieu, acutely observed points of comparison get made more 
vigorously about works of art than about the relative grandeur of the civic 
emblems that house them. At the 1984 opening of the much-beloved Temporary 
Contemporary, the Museum of Contemporary Art's satellite in Little Tokyo, 
grandiosity was in short supply. The unvarnished simplicity of the place was of 
the utmost significance. 
</P>
<P>
Anonymously built as a hardware company's warehouse a half-century ago, and 
left nominally raw as square footage when refurbished for museum use, this 
modest building suddenly set the skewed relationship between art and clubhouse 
into proper perspective. That's why the place is beloved. In an era of furious, 
high-profile clubhouse building both here and abroad, the museum quietly went 
against the grain. Radiating a startlingly cosmopolitan aura, the achievement 
made MOCA an international sensation virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of repeated design-debacles at the building of new culture clubs 
elsewhere in town, the Temporary Contemporary also had gone against the grain 
of local history. Tradition was eloquently upended, setting into motion a 
thoroughly galvanic cycle of provincial-into-cosmopolitan awareness. The 
earlier hiring of Arata Isozaki as architect for MOCA's principal home, then 
being constructed from scratch on a vacant lot on Grand Avenue, could finally 
be cast as a decision of great significance. New architecture is routinely 
claimed as a building art, and in the making of art the quality of the artist 
is always central. But those pious cliches, suddenly injected with life, could 
now be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The emergent cycle was capped with the joyful hiring last year of Frank O. 
Gehry as architect for the new Disney Concert Hall, the fourth theater for the 
Los Angeles Music Center, just up the block from MOCA's home. The old 
provincial debate for such glamour-projects had been: Which local or non-local 
architect is right for the job? In successive stages, it had been replaced by: 
Which architect is right for the job, including those whose practice is based 
in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
The distinction between the old debate and the new one seems small, but such 
meticulous refinements are in fact decisive. (God is in the details, as Mies 
van der Rohe taught us.) Incautiously used, adjectival terms like local art, or 
even Los Angeles and California art, can be ruinous. The reason is plain: Great 
art is placeless. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean art isn't deeply rooted in the locality in which it gets made, or 
that its contours aren't profoundly shaped by a thousand critical nuances of 
context. Neither do I mean that art is universal, as if the very idea of art as 
a kind of visual Esperanto wasn't itself the product of a highly specific 
moment in the modern, industrialized West. What I mean is that art opens up 
experience, and it's onerous to try to put art or experience in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry intuitively understands this cosmopolitan sense of placeless-ness. Gehry, 
whose own work is especially indebted to cues taken from works of art, had 
overseen the refurbishing of the Temporary Contemporary. His canny decision to 
pretty much leave the warehouse alone, architecturally, created a dazzling kind 
of "negative space" -- an architectural no-place, in which the roaming 
pleasures of aesthetic experience were vivified. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Gehry did manage to put dramatically in its place the former 
status of the culture club. Hardly a peremptory civic emblem, his 
nuts-and-bolts building declared itself not to be the end of the laborious 
effort called a museum. The building was just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MIKE KELLEY IS THE FIRST L.A. ARTIST WHOSE DEVELOPING REPUTATION COINCIDES WITH 
HIS ART'S DEVELOPING MATURITY. 
</P>
<P>
One way to measure the condition of the art scene in Los Angeles is to see 
whether or not it's an active participant in art's currently vigorous, newly 
international conversations. That means identifying whether or not artists who 
choose to live and work here can develop important reputations beyond the 
outskirts of town. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's evidence that some artists can. John Baldessari, Bruce Nauman and 
Edward Ruscha all were making first-rate art in the robust 1980s, a fact that 
has not gone unnoticed internationally. But all three had initially stirred 
interest during the first rush of L.A.'s prominence as an art scene 20 years 
ago -- and none was able to secure that initial reputation for at least a 
decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise the sculptor Chris Burden, whose subsequent emergence as a performance 
artist in the 1970s was as spectacular as it was short-lived. Only now is 
Burden receiving the kind of high-profile attention commensurate to the 
importance of his work. 
</P>
<P>
The "arrival," internationally, of all four by the late 1980s is today being 
followed closely by that of artist Mike Kelley. But the path of Kelley's 
emergent career in the last 10 years has been starkly different from any of his 
predecessors: Almost immediate admiration in Los Angeles has led steadily to 
enthusiastic interest in both New York and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley is 36. Baldessari, Ruscha, Nauman and Burden range in age from 43 to 58. 
The generational difference is notable. Kelley is the first artist working in 
Los Angeles whose developing reputation -- locally, nationally, internationally 
-- is fully coincident with the developing maturity and resonance of his 
extraordinary art. 
</P>
<P>
At the risk of getting buried beneath a pile of demographic flow charts that 
would devolve into comic monologue, this is a clear sign of a newly 
cosmopolitan character at work in this city. It is not, however, the signal for 
a testimonial dinner with self-congratulations offered all around. After all, 
we are talking about the reputation of a single artist, and of an only slightly 
larger number of artists who are linked by a single gender and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities have opened for a variety of artists in a variety of places 
because the internationalism that characterized the art scene of the 1980s has 
wrecked the possibility of total dominion being held by a powerfully monolithic 
center. Today, an artist doesn't get to be an active player in the 
international discourse without participation in the art scenes of New York and 
Europe, whose pull is strong. An artist does, however, get to be an active 
player without Los Angeles, whose influence remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEING A MAJOR COLLECTOR OR DEALER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING AN INFORMED 
PLAYER. 
</P>
<P>
In this youthfully cosmopolitan city, too few individuals are seizing the day. 
And I don't mean the artists. 
</P>
<P>
Major collectors of contemporary art -- major being a distinction I make 
according to volume of passionately informed activity in the international art 
scene, not according to volume of dumb money spent -- play a number of 
important cultural roles. One serious one is noticeably lacking here. Major 
collectors don't yet seem to know the clout they wield, or perhaps how to wield 
it, in helping to establish important new artists. Not a single one played a 
significant part in the wider appreciation of Mike Kelley's art. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical and institutional champions of Kelley's work steadily presented 
themselves throughout the 1980s, as did a few collectors who were influential 
locally. In general, though, and except for isolated works by the artist, major 
collectors in Los Angeles have felt more secure consuming art by established 
names. 
</P>
<P>
Which is to say, names being established elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
For collectors, establishing new artists translates into the commitment of 
aggressively informed acquisition -- a decidedly nerve-wracking thing to do. 
After all, when you're out there in a relatively unpopulated field, dense with 
thorny underbrush, and are relying on your eyes, your ears, your charms and 
your wits to get by, the prospect for doom is immense. And given the newly 
international stakes, you'll be called on to vigorously defend your unheard-of 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Vigorously arguing unheard-of positions is the national sport in cosmopolitan 
culture. I'm a wee bit biased in this regard, because I'm speaking of an area 
dear to my heart. But art criticism takes a variety of forms, and assembling a 
collection can be among the most persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
So, of course, can writing. But writing plainly suffers as an avenue for 
informed, contentious argument when there's virtually no place to publish. This 
absence, widely noted, is commonly followed by claims of the dearth of critics 
locally, as if criticism could become a venerable, far-flung practice when 
there is no place in which to publish -- no place, that is, except venues whose 
editors reside on the other side of the country and whose agendas are their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
The actual problem lies elsewhere: Pathetically few art dealers in Los Angeles 
pay the matter the slightest attention. Major dealers of contemporary art -- 
major being a distinction I make according to volume of passionately informed 
activity in the international art scene, not according to volume of dumb money 
made -- play a number of important roles in a cosmopolitan milieu, including as 
supporters of critical debate. That's done principally through indirect 
channels, by way of the advertising that gets art magazines published. Therein 
lies a tale. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a disaster waiting to happen called Artcoast magazine blew into 
town, trailing lots of razzle-dazzle. But the screamingly awful name -- I 
imagined a phalanx of blissed-out subscribers drooling, "Let's go Artcoasting," 
as they set out on skateboards for the Santa Monica gallery crawl -- was a dead 
giveaway of gruesome things to come. (The moniker had been chosen by the 
magazine's publisher, a lapsed Madison Avenue marketing whiz.) The publication 
proudly positioned itself as a journal of, by and for the culture of the 
Pacific Rim -- which is to say, a navel-gazing promotional journal of, by, and 
for provincial culture. It sank like a stone, disappearing into the abyss after 
issue No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Also last year, a small journal financed on a shoestring and called Art issues. 
began publishing literate, sometimes quirky, frequently insightful criticism. 
The punctuation in the magazine's title slyly transforms it into a declarative, 
two-word sentence -- Art issues period. This knowing gesture is miles apart 
from the blithering nothingness of Artcoast, with its local pitch. All 10 
issues have been worth reading. Still, woefully few galleries regularly 
advertise. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery ads aren't in magazines to bring customers in the door or to "buy" 
reviews. Their function is to assist in creating a dense atmosphere of 
importance around the discussion of art, and then to place the gallery and its 
artists in proximity to that momentous debate. Symbiosis between commercial 
galleries and disinterested criticism is crucial, but prospects for worldly 
engagement are dimmed when a big chunk of the equation is missing. 
</P>
<P>
Artcoast was emphatically promotional in style and substance. Art issues. 
emphatically isn't. That the former folded fast while the latter struggles on 
is at least encouraging. For art, it might signal a crack in the boosterish, 
public relations mentality endemic to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOOSTERISM, THE ENEMY. ART NEEDS NO JUSTIFICATION, DEFENSE OR SUPERVISION. 
</P>
<P>
Demolishing that mentality is essential because boosterism is provincial. 
Boosterism is about justifying the value of a place -- your place -- by 
encouraging identification with your city, your state, your country. Being 
"true to your school" means reciting a pledge of cultural allegiance, the 
taking of a loyalty oath with which to justify your worthiness to belong. 
Adolescent in temperament, the association gets made in order to hold at bay an 
inchoate horror at the dawning prospect of finding yourself out there, all 
alone, in a grown-up world utterly indifferent to your existence. 
</P>
<P>
Dysfunction is inevitable in a climate tyrannized by effusive self-promotion 
and mawkish public relations because adolescence is prolonged. Los Angeles, 
glistening oasis that public relations built from little more than semi-arid 
desert scrub, suffers special burdens in this regard. Relentless promotion is a 
way of life, as habitual as breathing and bolstered by historic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the intricate pleasures of cosmopolitan culture are calibrated by 
the sharp resonances of aesthetic experience, which is always anarchistic and 
destabilizing. (That's why conservatives hate art so, and why the art world's 
typically ascribed profile is liberal.) The great and wondrous paradox of 
cosmopolitan culture is that civilization gets generated by the willingness, 
even eagerness, to engage the stresses and strains of aesthetic anarchy -- of 
art that goes against the grain. 
</P>
<P>
As surely as in politically repressive regimes, refinements of aesthetic 
experience get dulled in an atmosphere dense with cultural boosterism, where 
blunt enforcement of the law of the land is paramount. Gleeful aesthetic 
anarchy isn't wildly compatible with thickly bureaucratic demands. 
</P>
<P>
In our era of woozy national drift, the problem is compounded. America's 
favorite pastime (after baseball) is to periodically flirt with the strangling 
embrace of the loyalty oath. If you doubt it, think of assorted instrumental 
issues preoccupying the strained energies of the day, from gross claims that 
the Pledge of Allegiance and flag-burning are topics pivotal to our pressing 
national debate, to shameful campaigns against free speech in programs 
supported by the National Endowment for the Arts. Sentimental illusions and the 
fears they conceal repeatedly divert us. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, art needs no justification, no defense, no supervision in loco 
parentis. What art needs is sly challenge, discerning argument, delirious 
intercourse. It needs a light touch too. When we talk of art, we are not 
talking of healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked. We are not 
talking of moral obligations, but of gratuitous activity. Americans, thanks to 
the storied tenacity of their Puritan heritage, have always had trouble with 
art because it doesn't come to them "the old-fashioned way." You don't earn the 
right to receive the gifts that art is prepared to give. You accept the offer, 
or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Either way is fine. But if you choose to engage art's ongoing conversations, 
you certainly have to pay close attention amid the deafening racket of 
competing voices. Cosmopolitanism is characterized by a constant refusal to be 
bound by established habits or ingrained prejudices, old or new. By definition, 
it's open to perpetual flux. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NEW PLAYERS. DON'T BE INTIMIDATED WHEN YOU HEAR 'MULTICULTURAL'-IT'S AN OLD 
IDEA WRAPPED IN A NEW LABEL. 
</P>
<P>
Today, multicultural is the new buzzword being most vigorously pushed to 
replace world class as boosterish civic emblem. As an adjective for art it 
doesn't really mean much. As an adjective for Los Angeles, though, it speaks 
volumes. Multicultural speaks of a dawning consciousness of the untapped power 
available in a culture whose origins and offshoots both are international. It 
speaks of the urge toward cosmopolitanism. 
</P>
<P>
As a term, multicultural art is as windy and supererogatory as cosmopolitan 
art. That it's a new coinage likely has to do with subconscious recognition of 
old failures in old cosmopolitan centers, and with an up-front desire to 
acknowledge today's abundance of new constituencies -- principally Asian and 
Central and South American -- that often were remote from European linkages of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
As Americans, we have from the very start defined ourselves not simply 
according to who we are (or think we are), but according to who we are not. 
This is probably to be expected of a nation of immigrants. No matter how much 
fealty to assorted heritages we truly feel, immigrants (and especially their 
grown children) are people who are not about to undergo the unnerving traumas 
of relocation to an alien land simply to let themselves be identified as 
exactly who had been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
The specific identity of "Who we are not" has typically been multiple and 
fluid, with different bogeymen assuming the spotlight at different moments in 
history. America's postwar engines have been driven by the incantatory 
declaration: We are not Commies. Today, as an end to the Cold War is declared, 
winding down the protracted postwar era, the "who" that we have for so long not 
been has evaporated like a mirage. Anchorless, America's negative identity 
flails in wild and woolly flux. 
</P>
<P>
Who are we not going to be now? Externally, the Japanese are, for all the 
obvious reasons, the leading candidates for jingoist denial. At home, the 
candidacy is held by a familiar litany of beleaguered, second-class citizens -- 
blacks, Latinos, women, gay people, Jews -- as the steadily rising tide of hate 
crimes eloquently attests. 
</P>
<P>
In its artistic life, Los Angeles has long vigorously identified itself 
according to who it is not: L.A. is not New York. (Drat! I swore I'd get 
through this without ever mentioning Them.) Lots of things distinguish the two 
places. None is more important than this: Unlike urban New York, which took a 
19th-Century European and industrial model to unprecedented heights, Los 
Angeles is a powerful, suburban metropolis constructed as 20th-Century 
America's mass culture model. As such, it is the central symbol for a paradox 
unique to our time. 
</P>
<P>
The city of colossal dreams and endless promises that's always in the 
ascendant, Los Angeles is also notorious for never quite being able to make it 
over the top, for repeatedly failing to make the grade. The Sisyphean paradox 
is this: Wretched failure is perversely essential to mass culture's whopping 
triumphs. Desire is the fuel that turns the engines of consumption, and 
relentless disappointment is what generates perpetual desire. Mass culture 
demands its quota of degradation, in order to flourish and to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
To degrade is to de-differentiate, to generalize, to break down and make less 
specific. Degradation is the antithesis of refinement, and refinements of 
experience are the province and the pleasure of art. The tensions inherent in 
this paradoxical phenomenon, and the spiritual, moral, emotional toll it takes, 
has been the great subject of Mike Kelley's disturbing and deeply moving art. 
It shows us who we are. That his art claims inescapable resonance nationally 
and internationally is an indication of its trenchant worldliness.

The claim "L.A. is not New York" is true -- but, whether said with pride or 
derision, repeatedly declaring the obvious certainly makes for dull 
conversation. More important, the fact that it's said at all seems darkly 
masochistic. For whatever else it is, New York is a prominent aberration in 
American culture at large: Its artistic life has unremittingly courted the 
difficult pleasures of aesthetic anarchy. If Los Angeles is not yet New York in 
the eagerness with which it courts this cosmopolitan attitude, those worldly 
stresses and strains are nonetheless all around. They're just waiting to be 
engaged.

GERMAINE GREER AS DOGGED DAUGHTER; 
</P>
<P>
DADDY, WE HARDLY KNEW YOU BY GERMAINE GREER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 320 PP; 
0-394-58313-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mairs, Mairs' memoir, Remembering the Bone House, has recently been 
issued in paperback by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Quest," Germaine Greer titles the opening chapter of "Daddy, We Hardly 
Knew You," a memoir of her search for her father's past begun after his death 
in 1983, as if to lift her pursuit to mythic heights. But the premise of the 
heroic quest is that its object possesses unique, often mysterious, even 
sacred, value, capable of transforming at least the searcher and generally the 
wider world as well. In these terms, Greer's is an anti-quest: "a classic 
example of herstory (sic), puncturing the ideology" of the hero. 
</P>
<P>
Although she knew her father for more than 40 years, Greer learned almost 
nothing about his background, and what little information he released, she 
discovers, was fabricated. Reticence this absolute seems all but implausible, 
but apparently the "anxiety neurosis" with which Reg Greer returned from World 
War II effectively barred all inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"You will be wondering why I did not simply ask my mother," Greer says. Yes, 
indeed, that's exactly what I was wondering. "Suffice it to say that for Mother 
language is a weapon rather than a means of communication." Two less appealing 
creatures than Reg and Peggy Greer, as seen through their daughter's eyes, 
would be hard to imagine. But at least their singularly uncooperative natures 
provide her the pretext for a book. 
</P>
<P>
And a book of sorts she produces: part childhood reminiscence, part travelogue, 
part genealogy, part history, part social commentary. Unfortunately, the lack 
of something meaningful at the center (Daddy, I believe) prevents these 
elements from coalescing. Greer is a skillful writer, and there are plenty of 
terrific passages here: quick insights ("Our whole lives are lived in a tangle 
of telling, not telling, misleading, allowing to know, concealing, 
eavesdropping and collusion"); painterly descriptions of landscape from 
Tasmania to Tuscany; a breathtaking evocation of conditions during the siege of 
Malta. Too often, however, the insights are facile. 
</P>
<P>
This clutter becomes especially troublesome with regard to the book's central 
purpose: the revelation of the "truth" about Reg Greer's life, which his 
daughter confounds with the knowledge of his origins and antecedents. Now, as 
the popularity of Alex Haley's "Roots" demonstrated some time ago, many people 
are fascinated by their lineage; at least half a dozen of my friends and 
relations pursue their forebears with varying degrees of preoccupation. But it 
seems a queer sort of obsession for a feminist to take up with scant 
reflection; and really this author of an early and influential feminist text, 
"The Female Eunuch," has given herself over to her patrilineal search with far 
fewer and less sophisticated questions than readers might reasonably hope. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, with prodigious expenditures of money, time and energy, she amasses 
and recounts quantities of genealogical detail. She is nothing if not the 
"doggedest of daughters," and the descriptions of her research methods, 
frustrations and victories may prove instructive to other genealogists. The 
rest of her readers must simply slog along in her wake (wondering, perhaps, why 
she perseveres until they read: "I cannot go backward. I've spent too much of 
the advance." Ah, Knopf has paid for a book, and a book they shall have). 
</P>
<P>
For naught, it turns out. Because, after transforming herself into "a 
Greero-logist, a Greerographer, a Greeromane" and summarizing one Greer 
pedigree after another (perhaps so that her readers can experience the same 
sense of wasted time she endured), she turns out to be "not a Greer" at all but 
a Greeney by adoption, a Hamilton by birth. Her father's lies and evasions 
masked no "prince in disguise"; he was simply ashamed to have been an 
illegitimate child reared by poor but honest folk whom he left without looking 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how I try," Greer writes, "no matter how loyal I feel, I cannot make 
this man a hero." And perhaps it's this incapacity that dooms the book. 
Perhaps, if you're going to set out on a quest (itself conventionally 
considered a heroic undertaking), its object must be rare and precious in some 
way. Perhaps it -- in this case he, Reg Greer -- can't be a "liar," a "bounder" 
an "office masher," snobbish and cowardly and small-minded. Perhaps the failure 
lies in the unworthiness of the object. 
</P>
<P>
"Daddy, we hardly knew you," Greer complains. "Why would we even want to?" the 
reader may sadly ask.

STINKING DRUNK, AND IN FRONT OF THE KIDS;

<P>
THE MUSIC ROOM BY DENNIS MCFARLAND (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95; 265 PP.) 
</P>

<P>
The phrase dysfunctional family rolls trippingly off the tongue nowadays, 
summoning up a wealth of damage, anger and confusion, yet seeming somehow to 
compress all the pain into a neatly manageable category. 
</P>
<P>
Dysfunction can range from extreme cases of child abuse of the sort that 
horrify hardened police officers, to the kinds of emotional neglect that are so 
commonplace as to seem almost endemic: parents who refuse to be -- or who are 
unable to be -- parents; bad marriages in which children become the victims; 
families in which attention and affection are short-circuited by dependence on 
drugs or alcohol -- each unhappy family, as Tolstoy put it, unhappy in its own 
special way. Yet, certain patterns do emerge, which, pace Tolstoy, give the 
stories -- and case histories -- of dysfunctional families something of a 
familiar ring to the postmodern, therapy-trained ear. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis McFarland's first novel (part of which first appeared, in slightly 
different form, in the New Yorker) deals with a classically dysfunctional 
family, yet manages to state the obvious without sounding cliched. The mother, 
a former Las Vegas showgirl, spends her afternoons in a drunken haze, aided and 
abetted by a pair of boozing buddies. The father, scion of a wealthy, alcoholic 
Virginia family, withdraws into his music room, where he spends his days 
quietly imbibing oblivion and brooding over his failure to attempt -- let alone 
achieve -- his dream of a musical career. Martin and Perry, the two sons, born 
four years apart, share similar experiences growing up in this milieu, but 
certain differences of temperament give each a subtly and significantly 
different perspective on those experiences. 
</P>
<P>
The novel opens in 1976, when Martin Lambert, nearly 30, head of a small San 
Francisco record company, is summoned East by a phone call from the New York 
City police notifying him of his younger brother's suicide. Trying to cope with 
the shock of Perry's death, searching for reasons that might explain it, Martin 
is plunged into a dazed, dreamlike state, in which lost memories resurface and 
the past slowly acquires shape, color and weight. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is further agitated by meeting up with a sympathetic and attractive 
woman named Jane Owlcaster, Perry's lover before the break-up in their 
relationship that occurred shortly before his death. Jane, like everyone else 
in Perry's life, is initially stunned by Martin's physical resemblance to his 
brother. She and Martin sense the dangers of falling in love with each other, 
yet they also sense the possibility of consolation and renewal in such a 
relationship sometime in the indefinite future. 
</P>
<P>
Pondering Perry's death, Martin can find no single immediate cause that 
triggered his leap from a hotel window. Yet underlying causes seem scattered 
like combustible materials throughout Perry's childhood -- and his own: 
alcoholic parents locked in a cool, yet deadly stand-off of disappointment and 
recrimination; a wife whose contempt for her husband turns his life into a kind 
of slow suicide. The desperation of the situation is disguised by the seeming 
ordinariness of their squabbling: 
</P>
<P>
"Father finds Mother in the library playing solitaire . . . cursing the cards 
under her breath, cigarette hanging from her lips, its ash about to drop. 
'You're drunk,' he says to her from the doorway, disgusted. 'You're drunk,' 
Mother says to Father in the music room as he lies on the couch staring at the 
ceiling. . . . In the entryway, gripping her braceleted wrists -- is she about 
to hit him? -- he says to her (a harsh whisper, for there are guests in the 
library), 'You're drunk.' Long before I knew what the word meant, I identified 
it as the meanest thing they said to each other. And when I finally knew that 
it was what you got from drinking whisky, it seemed a very strange thing to 
accuse each other of, since they were always drinking whisky." 
</P>
<P>
As Martin struggles to extricate himself from his family's ill-fated 
tendencies, he comes to see that his parents' marriage was even worse than he 
knew. Only Perry, who was less of an onlooker, more of an emotionally involved 
participant, had a clear view of it all, and this clarity of vision may well 
have contributed to his suicide. But Martin, unlike Perry, recognizes the part 
played by alcohol in exacerbating the family's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Baldly summarized, the story sounds like an Alcoholics Anonymous parable. As 
handled by McFarland, it is something more. He is too sensitive a writer to hit 
us over the head with the obvious: Even when they seem to exemplify casebook 
histories, his characters retain a measure of mystery that lends dimension. 
</P>
<P>
It would be fair to say that this is a reasonably "faultless" first novel, 
carefully observed, self-scrutinizing without excessive self-consciousness, and 
written so seamlessly that you don't really notice the writing. Is it also fair 
to criticize a novel for being somehow too perfect? McFarland's professional 
polish seems less a personal trait than a characteristic acquired from repeated 
and prolonged immersion in professional writing programs. The well-tempered but 
undistinctive style of his writing is suitable enough, but one suspects it 
would suit almost any other young novelist just as well. 
</P>
<P>
For all its virtues, "The Music Room" remains a novel that inspires 
appreciation and respect rather than astonishment and delight. Pace the 
hyperbolic publicity material, it is hardly (and I quote the encomium by 
storyteller Frank Conroy) "the kind of book you press into people's hands 
telling them if they don't read it you'll never speak to them again." 
</P>
<P>
Insofar as one's friends may have qualities that make them irreplaceable, and 
this novel, though valuable, does not, I, for one, would think twice before 
presenting them with the alternative.

THE BOOK TRADE: MAKING A KILLING OFF TRUE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hours after Chuck Stuart splashed into Boston Harbor from the Tobin Bridge last 
January, the phone at our house began ringing with fierce determination. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart was the hero-turned-villain of Boston's spiciest murder in years: the 
man who first insisted that he and his seven-months-pregnant wife had been shot 
by a black assailant who leaped into the back seat of the Stuarts' Toyota 
Cressida, but who later, it seems, turned out to have done the shooting 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Our telephone was ringing so insistently because my husband and I both are 
journalists. Apparently that fact alone -- or that plus our Massachusetts 
residency -- qualifies us to be described as true-crime writers. This is at 
least what one would infer from the telephone calls that came to us from an 
extraordinary parade of half-frantic agents, publishers, editors and movie 
producers: 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, is your husband there?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm sorry, he's not." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not. Well, hmmm, would you like to write a book?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm sorry, I think not. Would you like to speak to the dog?" 
</P>
<P>
The calls would have been at least a boost for the ego were it not for the fact 
that just about anyone with even tangential involvement with any Boston-area 
newspaper or magazine, or anyone who is based in this area and does any 
reporting at all, seems to have faced the same flood of solicitations. One 
reporter at the Boston Globe told me that he received 11 inquiries about 
possible books or movies -- and that was just in the first week after Stuart's 
apparent suicide. A reporter at another paper put me on hold while she took 
another call from still another Hollywood producer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of 'tasteless' or 'tacky,' " one editor remonstrated when 
I used those words before referring him to our 73-pound Samoyed. "It's a 
question of people wanting to read this story. And it's a helluva story." 
</P>
<P>
But of course it is not just this story. More and more, readers and publishers 
seem to be swimming in the same collective pool of blood and gore. It is hard 
to say which came first, the supply or the demand. But it is clear that the 
thirst for real crime -- true crime, gory, gross and disgusting crime -- 
appears to be insatiable. 
</P>
<P>
"My theory is that it is somehow connected to the rise of tabloid television," 
Neil Nyren, editor-in-chief and publisher of G. P. Putnam's Sons, said. 
Putnam's is the publisher of one of the titans of true-crime writing, Joe 
McGinnis, of "Blind Faith" and "Fatal Vision" notably. 
</P>
<P>
The reason those two books by McGinnis did so well is the same reason so many 
people were interested in the Stuart story, Nyren suggested. Chuck and Carol 
Stuart had worked themselves up from blue-collar beginnings to all the comforts 
of true yuppiedom. They had a house with a swimming pool and a wreath made out 
of teddy-bears on the front door. Chuck Stuart, a former dishwasher, wore suits 
from the fanciest men's store in Boston and had his prematurely graying temples 
touched up at a salon overlooking the Boston Public Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of the fascination, that this could be the neighbor next door," 
Nyren said. "You rarely think, 'This could happen to me.' But you do think, 
'This could be my neighbor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harry MacLean, the author of the best-selling "In Broad Daylight" (Harper &amp; 
Row, cloth; Dell, paper) about the 1981 murder of the town bully in a small 
town in northwest Missouri, agrees. MacLean was "just another hack lawyer" 
practicing in Denver when he decided to switch to true-crime writing, in part 
because of what he saw as the universal appeal of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent lecture about true-crime writing at the Tattered Sleeve bookstore 
in his hometown of Denver, MacLean said he turned the question on his audience 
of nearly 200 people and asked them why they like to read this stuff. Their 
answer confirmed his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, they said a lot of these stories involve ordinary people, the 
people next door," MacLean said. He noted that he was calling from Foster City, 
Calif., where he was investigating a case involving "a fireman and a 
housewife." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing that motif, Pocket Books Hardcover has been promoting one title as an 
example of "ordinary people, extraordinary crimes." The book, "Without Mercy: 
Obsession and Murder Under the Influence," by Gary Provost, deals with a 
waitress at a pancake restaurant who joins her homosexual supervisor in 
plotting two brutal murders. Carlton Stowers' "Innocence Lost," also from 
Pocket Books Hardcover, recounts the murder of an undercover policeman posing 
as a high school student in a small Texas town. 
</P>
<P>
The reading public's appetite for this kind of book truly does seem insatiable. 
Day after day, press releases come in announcing new books about "shocking 
deaths," murders in a pediatric intensive-care unit, matricide, fratricide, 
patricide, psychopathic killers and crimes of vengeance, jealousy, avarice or 
old-fashioned passion. 
</P>
<P>
But the flip side of the phenomenon is that not only does the public expect 
this kind of delicious fodder, so do the subjects. It's as if anyone with the 
slightest involvement in a potentially marketable crime of any kind figures 
that he or she can, pardon the expression, make a killing off it. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean said that one reason he chose to back away from the Charles Stuart 
case, for example, was that "I heard that the assistant DAs were faxing their 
stories out to Hollywood." It was "too bizarre," he said. It seemed that "the 
process was going to taint the story." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and crime victims -- even friends and relatives of crime victims -- now 
flock to literary agents and true-crime writers on their own. It may be that 
they actually enjoy the attention, that this is their personal and proverbial 
15 minutes of fame. But as MacLean observed, "It feels kind of sick, in a way." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, many print journalists, not notoriously among the most overpaid of 
professionals, have come to see the perfect true-crime story as the vehicle 
that will vault them out of penury and into the ranks of true-crime giants -- 
writers, they say in wistful tones, such as Truman Capote or Norman Mailer. 
Words like miniseries or feature film invariably accompany discussions of books 
about true crimes. The implication is that even the most starving of starving 
journalists will be able to junk that old Toyota and cruise around in the 
Mercedes he or she secretly covets. 
</P>
<P>
Covering a story they think might be lucrative, journalists come to feel 
possessive about the cast of characters. It becomes "my murder" or "my book." 
Certainly this has been true in a number of recent well-publicized crimes, such 
as the Steinberg murder-and-child-and-wife-abuse case in New York City; the 
preppie murder in New York City; Boston's Stuart case; the Yom Kippur murders 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Not every true-crime book is a guaranteed ticket to financial heaven, however. 
Books that come out as little more than a string of newspaper articles seldom 
make big waves. As greedy as readers may be for these stories, they do demand 
writing skills from the authors. 
</P>
<P>
What most captures the public fancy is a book that transcends the facts of a 
single case and deals with bigger themes. Ideally, the story also should serve 
as a mirror of some segment of American life as well. 
</P>
<P>
The "sudden burst" in true-crime stories "caught us by surprise," Neil Nyren 
said, so much so that "there's no way to tell where it's going." 
</P>
<P>
But as long as there is tabloid television, and as long as there are savory 
stories to tell, the pace seems unlikely to slow. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, my dog would like it known that he is a very good writer and 
that he is thinking of hiring an agent. 
</P>

HUNTING THE MOBY-DICK OF THE VELDT; 
</P>
<P>
A TIME TO DIE BY WILBUR SMITH (RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95; 480 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Jaffe, Jaffe is a free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
With "The Green Hills of Africa," Ernest Hemingway took unfair advantage of 
anyone who wanted to sit down and write a good safari novel. Simply said, he 
did it best -- contrasting the simple purity of the African tracker with the 
neuroses of the well-heeled white client, using the cunning of the hunted to 
test the mettle of the hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Half a century later, Hemingway still owns the ground, but after 21 books, many 
of them successful best sellers in Britain and America, Wilbur Smith has earned 
the right to contest his crown. In "Time to Die," Smith almost gets it right -- 
using language sparsely and precisely to convey all the elements of the hunt, 
from the erotic thrill of facing down big game in its own element to the 
amazing affinity some Africans have developed for animals and the bush. 
</P>
<P>
But then he blows the contest with the Old Master -- and the integrity of the 
book -- by allowing the plot to go haywire, in what reads suspiciously like 
someone's mistaken idea of what Hollywood is looking for in an African bush 
thriller. 
</P>
<P>
Smith lacks Hemingway's ironic wit and underlying sense of the contradicting 
nobility/futility of the hunt, but he can stand up to the Old Man in his 
knowledge of guns and animals and the tall grass. This passage describing the 
simple but critical moment of the kill is typical of Smith at his best: 
</P>
<P>
"The lion's body filled most of the magnified field of the (gun sight). He 
could see the individual hairs in the dense curling bush of mane and the detail 
of each sculptured muscle beneath the skin. One inch behind the lion's 
shoulder, on the lateral center line of its body, was a tiny scar on the sleek 
side. It was shaped like a horseshoe, and a lucky horseshoe, and it made a 
perfect aiming point. He aligned the cross hairs of the sight on the scar. They 
bounced slightly to the elevated beat of his own heart. He took up the slack in 
the trigger, feeling the final resistance under his finger before the sear 
released and the rifle fired." 
</P>
<P>
For 26 years, Rhodesian-born Smith has been chronicling the saga of the 
Courtney family, a French-blooded, South African clan that he has tracked 
through four generations to sketch how whites and blacks have grown up together 
-- and yet apart -- in the South African veldt for the last 400 years. Now the 
line has descended to Sean Courtney, great-grandson of the Sean Courtney who 
appeared in Smith's first novel, "When the Lion Feeds" (1946). The brave, 
crusty Courtney is a professional hunter and a former colonel in the Rhodesian 
army who works a leased hunting concession in modern Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
Sean is retained to take a dying American businessman, Riccardo Monterro, on 
his last safari. The first half of the book is about their epic quest for one 
large "tusker" -- a giant elephant, known as Tukutela, "the Angry One." 
</P>
<P>
For 60 years, Tukutela has been ranging an area the size of Tennessee, 
successfully evading poachers and hunters. Weighing in at seven tons, with huge 
grass-stained tusks longer than the tallest man, he takes on the role of a 
Moby-Dick, almost daring the hunters to follow him farther into the scrub. 
Glimpsed in a distant corner of Sean's concession, he evades their traps and 
finally crosses into neighboring Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney thus faces a Hobson's choice: either finish the safari on his 
concession and deny his client-friend's dying wish to have a shot at the 
magnificent beast, or venture over the border into the midst of a nasty 
guerrilla war between two fierce African armies. Courtney's dilemma is 
heightened when in the course of hunting a lion, one of his trackers is mauled, 
and a lioness with cubs is shot by mistake -- both unpardonable sins under 
Zimbabwe's strict game regulations. That means that at the end of this safari, 
he will almost certainly lose his professional hunter's license; Monterro helps 
commit him to follow Tukutela with the offer of a half-million-dollar fee to 
carry on. 
</P>
<P>
This is unfortunate for the reader, for when the safari strays into Mozambique, 
Smith loses his feel for the book. A settler's son with an ax to grind, Smith 
is more intent on portraying the brutality and corrupt vision of the Marxist 
brigands and potentates who have taken over parts of southern Africa than on 
keeping to his original tale -- the story of a great hunter's last hunt. 
</P>
<P>
There also is an intriguing subplot that might have been developed instead -- 
as the bush-hardened Courtney finds himself falling for Monterro's beautiful, 
city-bred daughter, Claudia. Their love affair, the hunt for Tukutela and 
Courtney's interesting relationship with his loyal band of trackers offer the 
ingredients for a wonderful study of man and nature. But instead, Smith changes 
the book into a cheap thriller about Sean's attempt to rescue Claudia from the 
clutches of a fiendish African guerrilla leader, General China. 
</P>
<P>
Where in the early pages Smith devotes his considerable skills to explaining 
the tactics and logistics of hunting lion and elephant, he spends the latter 
half having Courtney doing outlandish nonsense, like trying to capture a fleet 
of Russian Hind helicopters for General China or training a band of illiterate 
guerrilla soldiers to accurately shoot sophisticated Russian surface-to-air 
Stinger missiles. In this section, Smith's gift for the narrative sinks to the 
banal, as when General China tortures Claudia to the point where she loses some 
of her idealistic notions about African rule. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is playing politics here; he's representing the frustration of the 
Afrikaner at the simplistic view of many Americans and Europeans toward Africa. 
There is nothing wrong with Smith's premise, of course: Many of Africa's black 
leaders have shown themselves to be every bit as shallow and cruel as the 
European colonists they replaced. But it's a shame to waste a good novel on the 
point,. and Smith isn't very good at writing it, as evidenced in this 
cliche-driven exchange between Claudia and General China: 
</P>
<P>
" 'My very dear Miss Monterro, your childlike belief in the myth of the 
essential goodness of mankind is really rather touching. I certainly have not 
fought so hard and so long to gain power simply to hand it over to a bunch of 
illiterate peasants. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
" 'So you're every bit as bad as you say the others are.' There were hot spots 
of anger on Claudia's cheeks. This was the man who had put chains on her wrists 
and incarcerated her in that vile pit. She hated him with all her strength. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I think you are actually beginning to understand at last, even through the 
haze of your liberal emotions. In Africa, there are no good guys and no bad 
guys, there are simply winners and losers.' He smiled again. 'And I assure you, 
Miss Monterro, that I intend to be one of the winners.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Africa, only novelists -- and, occasionally, Hollywood 
screenwriters -- talk like that. Today in Africa some winners are starting to 
emerge. White South Africans of Smith's generation are asking whether there 
can't be some accommodation with the black majority. Some blacks -- and South 
Africa probably has more college-educated blacks than any other 10 African 
countries -- are asking whether majority rule has to mean expelling all the 
Sean Courtneys of the world. And there are still many animals left to hunt and 
photograph, thanks to the growing determination of people to save the 
continent's great animal species and rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa appears to be about ready to join the league of civilized nations. 
Smith is still working on old myths and old arguments, and in this book, Sean 
Courtney already sounds a little outdated.

COMRADE SMIRNOFF, BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.; 
</P>
<P>
AN AMERICAN COMEDIAN RETURNS TO HIS NATIVE LAND -- THE BUTT OF HIS JOKES -- TO 
TAPE A TV SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE RINEHART and MOSCOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sporting fluorescent-Hawaiian-flowered swim trunks, black-framed sunglasses on 
cords, blue sun-block and a plastic fluorescent orange peaked cap, Yakov 
Smirnoff does not look like a man on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the former Soviet citizen-turned-American comedian looks downright out 
of place at Moscow's all-season outdoor swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by pensioners in make-do swim suits, Smirnoff is setting a new high 
in conspicuous consumption. To the comrades' further annoyance, Smirnoff has 
toys: a fluorescent-orange Frisbee and a multicolor skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
These are just a few of the tools Smirnoff has in his diplomatic handbag on his 
first trip to his homeland since he and his parents immigrated to the United 
States in 1977. While in the Soviet Union, he has taped location pieces in 
Moscow and in Odessa for a Showtime special to be shown later this year in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Among the purposes of his mission: introduce Soviets to the real American 
culture. Not the stuff of orchestra exchange programs, but the real stuff. 
Among the tools at hand: stuffed slippers adorned with Ronald Reagans; dancing 
flowers, Hula Hoops, footballs, Frisbees, Slinkys, skateboards, miniature 
airplanes, Twinkies and Juicy Fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnoff hopes the candid conversations he is holding with Soviets will give 
Americans a new view. "Americans think Soviets are so grim. I want them to see 
that they can smile." 
</P>
<P>
Smirnoff's film crew follows him around in his escapades with everyday Soviets 
-- standing in line at McDonald's, playing football with militiamen in Red 
Square and talking to students. In the TV program, Smirnoff will narrate in 
English over the Russian conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to be funny. The deepness in the message will still come through. 
The message is there's a flower of free enterprise here. This is our Berlin 
Wall, if you will. It's small and weak still, but it's there." 
</P>
<P>
It's been 12 years since Smirnoff left his native Odessa on the Black Sea and 
landed in New York. Since then he has gone from busing at restaurants to 
starring in Miller Lite commercials, a syndicated television series ("What a 
Country!") and a movie ("Moscow on the Hudson"). 
</P>
<P>
Is it easy to return as every would-be immigrant's dream-come-true? Considering 
he's made a living off taking digs at Soviets, there was the question of 
whether he would be welcome. "It wasn't hard to get in. Now we just have to see 
if I'll get out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He admits to having had knots in his stomach when he was taking off from 
Kennedy Airport in New York. "All of a sudden all of these things you left 
behind are (emotionally) coming back." 
</P>
<P>
And a lot of "these things" aren't pretty. The day he applied for a Soviet exit 
visa, Smirnoff lost his job as a comedian on Black Sea cruise ships. He waited 
two years to get out. 
</P>
<P>
For 26 years, Smirnoff lived in a communal apartment building, in one room 
shared with his parents ("I guess that's why I'm an only child"). Now he owns a 
Hollywood mansion with swimming pool and live peacocks roaming the grounds. "I 
bought it as a fixer-upper under the five-year plan. To my real estate agent, 
Chernobyl is a fixer-upper." 
</P>
<P>
He was on the waiting list for a Soviet car for 13 years. Now he drives a Rolls 
Royce with vanity plates that read "Comrade." And he was on a waiting list for 
a phone for 12 years. "I never got that either." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't the tough economics that Smirnoff hated most. "It was not being 
able to say what I wanted to say." 
</P>
<P>
Once a year Smirnoff turned in the script for his show to the censors at the 
Department of Jokes, under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture. You had to 
stick with whatever came out of there, he says. You couldn't take a chance on 
ad-libbing. "People have been taken away for less than a joke here," he points 
out. "At least that was what the fear was." 
</P>
<P>
Smirnoff remembers his last comedy show in Odessa at the 6,000-seat Green 
Theatre. It was April 1, 1977, just before he was to get permission to leave 
for New York. "I had started working again, and they were risking their jobs 
and paying me under the table. The system is so big. It sounds like they're 
watching every move you make, but a lot of times they don't know what they're 
doing. So I got away with it." 
</P>
<P>
He says he has mixed feelings about returning to Odessa. "I came to America to 
make it my home, and I did. So it's not like I'm returning home. I'm not sure 
of what I'm looking forward to about going back to Odessa. Most people will be 
looking for what things I can give them," he says sadly. "I know I used to when 
people came back from the West." 
</P>
<P>
What does he think about Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who made 
such visits as Smirnoff's possible with his policies of glasnost and 
perestroika? 
</P>
<P>
"He's changed a lot of things. In his anti-alcohol campaign he raised the legal 
drinking age from 2 to 4. You know there are 100,000 alcohol-related collisions 
a year here, and they don't even have cars." 
</P>
<P>
But now Smirnoff is serious. He thinks Lithuania is pushing Gorbachev to the 
wall and should slow down. "No matter what happens, he gave Soviets a taste of 
freedom, and now they can never go back. But the Lithuanians have got to watch 
out. You can't push. Look at what happened to the students in China. Ten years 
of improvements were lost." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of jokes is he telling here? Certainly not anti-Russian ones. 
</P>
<P>
"No one could tell political jokes. No one could tell government jokes. No one 
could tell TV evangelical jokes. You had to be funny without dirty language, 
political, religious or bodily function humor." 
</P>
<P>
What's left? Mother-in-law and animal jokes. You know: "A little ant got 
married to a female elephant and she died on their wedding night. And the ant 
says: 'I only enjoyed myself for one night and now I have to spend the rest of 
my life digging this grave.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smirnoff can't believe the changes in the U.S.S.R. "Some things are the same. 
There's still no food in the stores. But other things . . . you know we used to 
have to put pillows over our phones (where the microphones are hidden) before 
we would tell a joke in a house. Now they're selling matryoshka dolls (the kind 
where one fits inside another) . . . with Stalin inside of Lenin and so on, 
down to Yeltsin inside of Gorbachev. And comedians here are making fun of the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"You know there's so much humor here. I asked for an apple the other day and 
our Soviet crew members laughed. I said what's so funny. They said the Soviet 
Union is the only place where one word can make you laugh -- because those 
things aren't available here. You can't get them." 
</P>
<P>
Smirnoff is trying to flag down a taxi. He waves and waves and they keep 
whizzing by. He runs out onto the street. They still whiz by. He chases them. 
They don't stop. Now he pulls out a package of Marlboros and, in a shot that is 
not set up, a taxi screeches to a halt, practically running him down. There's 
no Marlboros here, either. 
</P>
<P>
In fact there's not much of anything here, but Smirnoff thinks there's material 
for comedy. Maybe another 12 years' worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff returned to Los Angeles this past week.

SINGER BOBBY MCFERRIN'S NOT WORRIED; HE'S HAPPY WITH NEW MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Airrrrr!" 
</P>
<P>
The word is delivered as a joyous high note as singer Bobby McFerrin leaps to 
his feet when a window in this backstage room at UCLA's Royce Hall is finally 
opened, admitting a fresh spring breeze. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin has been conducting one press interview after another on this recent 
Monday, and the windows have been closed because a radio show was being taped 
in an adjoining room. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly animated, McFerrin begins to bound up and down, first from one leg to 
the other, then in a pogo-ing series of jumping jacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I gotta move, or I'm going to fall asleep right on the spot," says the Grammy 
winner for 1988's Song of the Year, "Don't Worry, Be Happy," between bounces. 
The Bay Area resident is in town for an unusually long run at Royce Hall, where 
he appears Tuesday-Sunday evenings, with matinees on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin's fans will not see the one-man show that's been his mainstay for the 
last seven years. Instead, he will perform, with his new 10-member a cappella 
vocal ensemble, Voicestra -- pronounced, according to McFerrin, as 
"Voice-estra." 
</P>
<P>
It's a risky professional move, especially for a performer who is best known to 
the public as the composer and singer of the buoyantly optimistic hit song. 
</P>
<P>
But McFerrin is true to the words of his song. "Oh, I think I may have felt the 
pressure a year and a half ago to do a follow up to 'Don't Worry,' " he says, 
now seated in an easy chair, his fingers dancing in brisk rhythms across his 
knees. "But I didn't want to pander to an audience for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know, it's funny, because on the one hand I think an audience wants to 
hear you do the thing that made you popular. Yet, at the same time, when you do 
the same thing over and over again, they get bored, because they want you to do 
something new, too." 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin says he knew from the beginning of the solo (act) that he wouldn't be 
doing it for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking, very early on, what I would be following up solo work 
with, and Voicestra seemed to be the most logical progression. It's working 
with other singers, and it gives me a chance to work with my writing and my 
improvising with a group who is just as interested in these things as I am." 
</P>
<P>
Voicestra is made up of 10 talented singers from the San Francisco area -- "I 
must have auditioned over a hundred people before I found them," says McFerrin 
-- who bring to the ensemble an enormous range of performing arts experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got people who can do almost every kind of singing," he explains. "And 
the program will reflect that. We're doing a couple of classical pieces -- one 
by Bach and one by Vivaldi. We'll also be singing duets, bebop, gospel music, 
African chants, Gregorian chants and wild, off-the-wall improvisations. 
Honestly!" 
</P>
<P>
Never one to use a verbal explanation when a musical illustration is available, 
McFerrin rips off a little improvisational vocal demo, accompanying himself 
with crisp hand claps on his chest -- "thump, dubba, dubba thump." 
</P>
<P>
"The full ensemble won't be on stage for every number," he says. "We'll have 
different combinations, everything from solo pieces to the full 11 voices. In 
addition, one of our performers is adept at solo improvisational story telling, 
so we'll be doing some audience interaction, too." 
</P>
<P>
Does the arrival of Voicestra mean that the McFerrin solo career is a thing of 
the past? 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin pauses, then smiles and nods. 
</P>
<P>
"As of this moment, yes," he says. "Because I have no plans to perform again as 
a soloist. In fact, in five years I'm planning to stop touring entirely. I'll 
just run Voicestra, write music for it, and devote myself to composing and 
conducting." 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin pauses again, a mischievous look crossing his ever-mobile face. "But, 
on the other hand," he says, "I hate to say never, because all the things I'm 
learning with Voicestra might stimulate me to go back to do some solo 
performance and bring everything I've learned to it, to see how different it'll 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm not totally closing the door. But right now I'm looking forward to a 
good 10 years of collaborative work -- theatrical things, dance things, film, 
performance things." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, McFerrin plans to use Voicestra as the basis of a permanent 
San Francisco vocal organization patterned after a dance company. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very interested in theater," he explains, "and I see Voicestra becoming a 
group that uses costume changes, lighting design, choreography -- bringing all 
those elements together into a genuine vocal performance/art/theatre group -- 
whatever you want to call it. Sort of like a small contemporary opera company." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably complex plans for a performer who has spent most of his career 
touring as a solo act -- "Just me and my road manager/sound man, that was it," 
laughs McFerrin. But with two classical singers -- his mother and father -- in 
the family, and a sister who is a pop singer and vocal coach, there is a 
certain inevitability in McFerrin's plans for the Voicestra. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess as I look back I can say, 'Oh yeah, with those genes and all the 
influences, it just makes sense that I'm singing,' " McFerrin says. "But I 
stayed away from it for a long time, for reasons that I'm not quite clear on. 
It may be that God, in his wisdom knowing the gift I had and how I was going to 
use it, just made me wait until I was mature enough to use it. I like to think 
that."

SOLVING PRENATAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1989, about 2,500 women in Orange County were turned away from prenatal 
clinics because of overcrowding. Most hospitals and doctors in the county do 
not even treat Medi-Cal patients. That leaves poor, pregnant women no place to 
turn. They are left with only the dangerous option of going through their 
pregnancy without care, and then showing up at some hospital's emergency room 
when in labor. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the deplorable situation is corrected, such conditions are bound to 
cause health, social and economic problems for the mothers, their infants and 
entire community. That fact was brought home again in the last few days in two 
reports, one from the March of Dimes and the other released by the Orange 
County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes' six-month study, done by a UCLA researcher, predicted a 
shortage of maternity beds that could, if not corrected, cause "severe 
disruption" for the nine hospitals in the county contracting with Medi-Cal to 
care for low-income patients, and for many other hospitals and for women from 
all economic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury's report said the county was in a crisis over obstetrical care 
for the poor, and it recommended that the county expand its prenatal service 
clinics. The county should follow that advice. The Board of Supervisors has 
been weak in its commitment to health care for the poor. The increased dangers 
to mother and child of providing no prenatal care and added costs to the 
community are well-documented. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's report also urged the state to permit more obstetrics-only Medi-Cal 
contracts, a change that a poll conducted by doctors in the county has 
indicated would encourage more obstetricians to treat low-income pregnant 
women. Nearly seven out of 10 obstetricians and about three out of every four 
hospitals in Orange County now refuse to treat Medi-Cal patients. That is a 
shameful statistic for the doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious answer to the shortage of maternity beds is for hospitals to 
provide more of them -- and for more doctors to commit themselves to more 
deliveries, even if only one, two or three a month. Although the state made an 
exception in granting its first obstetrics-only contract to AMI Medical Center 
in Garden Grove (assuming it would become a full-service contract later), it 
has, with understandable reason, been reluctant to sign more of them. 
</P>
<P>
Although limited-care Medi-Cal agreements could provide a short-term solution 
and help ease the pressure on some overloaded delivery rooms by spreading the 
indigent patient load throughout the county, it has potentially serious 
drawbacks. The creation of a medical menu of services for hospitals to pick and 
choose from could, as the state fears, cause other hospitals to try to drop 
their full-service indigent care. Another major shortcoming is that 
limited-care arrangements do not address the basic issue of public underfunding 
of medical services. 
</P>
<P>
More doctors should be delivering more babies. But for that to happen, more 
hospitals must agree to treat Medi-Cal patients. Medi-Cal must do more to ease 
the delay and red tape in processing and make reimbursements more realistic for 
hospitals, as already has been done for the obstetricians. Until that happens, 
pregnant women will continue to face overcrowded delivery rooms and increasing 
medical risks.

STILL IN A HOLDING PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors needs a special bookcase, a large one at 
that, to store all the expensive studies it has ordered, paid for and thrown on 
the shelf to gather dust in the last three decades. It added another last week, 
a $750,000 gem that took more than two years to compile. It leaves the board 
where it has been stuck for years, with no recommended location for another 
airport to help meet the county's growing needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Airport Site Coalition, which presented the report to the supervisors last 
Tuesday, did urge creation of a public-private joint venture to pursue 
construction of a new airport. So far, so good. But instead of pinpointing one 
site, it presented four possibilities, all of which have so many environmental 
and political obstacles that one county official privately pronounced the 
report "dead on arrival." 
</P>
<P>
It well may be -- as some people have maintained for years -- that there is no 
suitable, safe, convenient and acceptable location for a new commercial jet 
airfield in Orange County. Studies for the last 30 years have failed to come up 
with one. Because of flight restrictions in a legal agreement made with Newport 
Beach, John Wayne Airport will fall short of serving the county's needs by 
about 14.8-million passengers each year by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing this, the supervisors seem to be looking more seriously beyond 
county borders, to places like George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, 
which is marked for closure by the Pentagon. That may not be so much looking to 
export Orange County's problem as it is finding a regional solution to a 
regional need. 
</P>

Past indecision has lost forever the most suitable sites for an airport in 
Orange County. What's left is a decision on less-than-perfect options. The 
supervisors must pursue those before they also disappear. But $750,000 later, 
they have received little help from the airport site report.

FEE TIED TO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IS A STEP TOWARD LOW-COST HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH FASSETT, Ruth Fassett is chairwoman of Irvine's Blue Ribbon Linkage Fee 
Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 20 years ago in Irvine, the first committee on housing recommended that 
there be affordable housing so that the people who worked in Irvine could 
afford to live in the city. As a member of that committee, it seemed to me that 
that was not an unreasonable expectation; however, even then there was 
opposition from real estate interests. They were concerned that affordable 
housing would interfere with their profit-making potential. 
</P>
<P>
Since then we know what has happened. Driven by the marketplace, real estate 
values have soared and huge profits have been made. At the same time, the city 
has struggled to promote affordable housing, but the supply doesn't begin to 
meet the demand. Today, only 12% of the people who work in Irvine live in 
Irvine. The remaining 88% waste hours of time on our congested freeways and 
contribute to the smog that threatens the health of each of us. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, projections for commercial and industrial development indicate that 
over 3 million square feet will be built each year until 2010. This amount of 
space translates to about 9,000 new employees, or more than 5,600 new 
households, with as many as 30% of them possibly qualifying for low-income 
housing. (Currently, a family of four must have an annual income under $37,500 
a year to qualify, which, according to the 1980 census, would make 60% of 
Irvine employees eligible.) 
</P>
<P>
The city is attempting to deal with this almost-certain shortage by planning 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Mandated by the State Housing Element law to provide decent housing for all 
income groups and to project what housing needs are anticipated, the City 
Council adopted a plan setting as a minimum goal that 25% of all housing built 
in Irvine be affordable to low-wage earners. Various sources of funding will be 
considered, such as federal and state grants and loans, tax credits to 
builders, tax-exempt revenue bonds, and something new, called a housing trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
The housing trust fund monies will be loaned or granted to low-income housing 
projects for such uses as down payment loans, on-site costs and school fees. 
One benefit of the trust fund is that it will have more stability than grants 
or loans that require renewal and depend on a particular political climate. The 
council is considering funding this trust fund by assessing a fee on the square 
footage of all new commercial and industrial development. (The fee is called a 
linkage fee because it is linked to the number of jobs created and resulting 
employees requiring low-income housing in Irvine.) 
</P>
<P>
The City Council created a 15-member committee representing a diversity of 
interests, including developers and low-income housing advocates, and charged 
them to recommend an appropriate linkage fee. As a member of the committee and 
a low-income housing advocate, I am satisfied with our recommendations of $3 to 
$5.50 a square foot, depending on the type of development, although I had hoped 
for something higher. 
</P>
<P>
It was not easy to reach these numbers. We waded through studies and ordinances 
on linkage fees enacted in other cities, such as San Diego, Sacramento, Menlo 
Park and in Santa Barbara County. We hired firms to conduct studies on the 
linkages between construction of residential buildings and the demand for 
housing affordable to lower-income groups in Irvine, and on the affordability 
gap between Irvine's housing costs and what low-income people here can afford 
to pay. In addition to the consultants, we had excellent assistance from the 
city staff. We never achieved consensus, and it was the developers and real 
estate interests who won the majority opinion that was submitted to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is with amazement that I listened to the frantic protests of the 
builders and developers when our report was submitted to the council. Despite 
the numerical data provided by the consultants and common sense, the building 
interests questioned whether a linkage could be established between new jobs 
created and the need for additional housing. Perhaps there are some factors 
other than job location that create demand, but given a choice, I'm certain 
that most workers would choose to live near their place of work. Common sense 
couldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Also questioned was the empirical data because the information regarding the 
size of households and increased labor participation from second-income wage 
earners was based on 1980 census material. Had we the time or money to collect 
more recent data, it is doubtful that the results would have been significantly 
different. Data regarding the number of low-income wage earners for each 
occupational grouping and the number of workers per 100,000 square feet in 
various industries was more recent, as was the salary data for each occupation. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, of course, complained that the fees would make building in 
Irvine prohibitive, and that developers would be forced to go elsewhere. 
However, according to the nexus study, the fees represent less than 3% of the 
total building cost and our consultants advised us that any fee below 5% would 
have little impact and would not redirect development. 
</P>
<P>
I have a background in business and I understand the necessity of profit and 
the importance of a return on investment. But I also know that less profit and 
less return is expected with lower risk. Irvine, with its proximity to the 
university and the airport, with its beautifully planned communities, excellent 
schools and relatively clean air, is not a high-risk area for developers. I am 
certain that development will continue regardless of the linkage fee. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, companies should find Irvine even more attractive when they 
realize that there is some promise of a diversified labor pool within the city 
and that their workers will not have to commute to Riverside or Corona in order 
to find affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is no different than the situation 20 years ago. Real estate 
interests are afraid that efforts to provide low-income housing will cut into 
their profits. Profit is the American way, and private enterprise could not 
exist without a profit motive, but it is also the American way to provide 
healthy, economically viable communities for all of our citizens.

ALLEGED SPEED TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great disgust your article (March 31) regarding the attorney, 
Ernest J. Franceshi Jr., wanting to sue my city because of an alleged speed 
trap. 
</P>
<P>
Poor guy! Eighty-five m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone; 75 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. 
zone; and 70 m.p.h. in a 50-m.p.h. zone. Next thing he'll want is that if he is 
the cause of an accident going that fast, he'll be suing for not having an 
officer there to stop him. It's a shame he doesn't use his legal talents for 
something more productive.

CANDIDATES FOR TUSTIN'S CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the major issues brought out by most of the candidates for the Tustin 
City Council is the chaotic, circus-like atmosphere of our council meetings. 
They are right on target. 
</P>
<P>
The most troublesome part of this situation, however, is that three of the 
candidates, John Kelly, Berklee Maughan and Carole Bryand have actively 
participated in creating this atmosphere, have said that they like the way the 
council has been running, and that they intend to generate more of the same if 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing our city needs is more clowns trying to keep the circus going. I 
would hope that people will take the time to vote on April 10, and to vote for 
candidates we can be proud of: candidates who will restore a professional and 
adult atmosphere to the serious business of running a city.

CANDIDATES FOR TUSTIN'S CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can Tustin believe anything Councilman John Kelly says? Kelly told the American 
Assn. of University Women that he would attend a candidates forum on March 27. 
He canceled at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed his attendance for the April 3 forum sponsored by the Tustin 
Meadows Community Assn. The confirmation was made to their management company. 
On April 2, at the Tustin City Council Meeting when Kelly was confronted with 
some alleged actions involving misuse of his position, he struck back with a 
comment that he would be at the Tustin Meadows forum the following night and he 
could be asked those questions there. Again he didn't show! 
</P>
<P>
On how many other issues has Kelly not done what he said? Can the citizens of 
Tustin tolerate another four years of saying one thing and doing another? His 
campaign signs and ads say "Honest" John Kelly. He even used President Abraham 
Lincoln's picture and quote in one of his ads. John, Honest Abe you are not.

THE EFFECT OF SEVERE PRUNING ON THE STRUCTURE AND BEAUTY OF TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is cheering to read of the efforts to preserve and protect heritage and 
other trees threatened by urban development (Times editorial "Trees to Reach 
New Heights," March 30). But development is responsible for adding many more 
new trees as well. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these trees are also in peril. Their graceful forms, which 
soften our architecture and temper the harshness of our climate, are routinely 
reduced to a collection of barren stumps. 
</P>
<P>
Unnecessarily severe pruning causes a tree's structural integrity and beauty to 
be forever ruined, creating safety and maintenance problems for the life of the 
tree where none previously existed. The costs are high: degradation of 
environmental quality, increased energy consumption by air conditioning, 
increased refuse to expanding landfills and unnecessary maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is apparently spreading. As with heritage trees, citizens' groups 
and city councils must act to curtail this destructive trend, or we will 
continue to bequeath to the future not a great urban forest, but a landscape of 
disfigured trees, impaired in beauty and function.

ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ORANGEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We foster parents who take children into our homes directly from Orangewood 
Children's Home want to take this opportunity to reply to the March 31 Times 
article listing allegations against Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
In comparing Orangewood and foster care as it is run by our county's Social 
Services, we feel that they rank with the very best programs and facilities 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood Children's Home has served as a model for development of other 
children's centers throughout the state and has been honored by the President. 
</P>
<P>
We have seen Social Services' response to public concerns about the care of our 
county's children and that they constantly try to make the changes to improve 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
We also live in reality, however, and understand that in a large bureaucracy 
such as Orange County Social Services, there are bound to be occasional 
injustices. The measure of the problem is what response and corrective action 
is taken. 
</P>
<P>
We support the system and feel confident that Social Services is working hard 
to meet the needs of individual children.

ESPERANZA'S RICHARDSON RUNS WILD AT POWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

POWAY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excuse Damon Richardson of Esperanza High School if he fell asleep on the way 
back from the Titan Track Festival at Poway High Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He had a long day. After catching a bus in Anaheim at 6 a.m., he and his 
teammates took a two-hour ride down to this San Diego suburb -- just to run in 
a track meet. 
</P>
<P>
All Richardson did was take five first places, four as a member of relay teams 
and a fifth in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who placed second to El Toro's David Fair in the Orange County 
championships two weeks ago only because he hit the final hurdle, atoned for 
that slip-up by running a personal and Orange County season best of 39.71 
seconds at Poway. His previous best was 40.1. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson also ran legs of the winning 800-meter relay team (1 minute 29.7 
seconds), the first-place shuttle hurdles relay team (1:04.63), the winning 
400-meter relay team (43.38), and the first-place 1,600-meter relay team 
(3:24.09). 
</P>
<P>
But it was Richardson's victory in the 300 hurdles that was most satisfying. 
The race went off less than seven minutes after the 400 relay finished. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't give me time to be nervous," Richardson said of the short rest 
between races. "I just concentrated on running. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired after running the relays, but still, I felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson took the lead at the outset, but appeared to be in jeopardy of 
losing it coming out of the turn when two other runners came on strong along 
the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"But as soon as I saw them catch up to me, I speeded up and carried it to the 
end of the race," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza also took first in the shotput, discus throw, high jump and triple 
jump relays. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs finished first in Division 8 with 107 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo girls' team also had some impressive marks in finishing first 
in Division 5 with 111 points. The Diablos finished first in four of the five 
field event relays and in four of the six track relays. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo placed first in the shotput (with a three-girl total of 96 feet 
11 inches), long jump (49-7 1/2), triple jump (109-4 1/2) and in the high jump 
(14-6). 
</P>
<P>
In the track relays, Mission Viejo took first in the 800 meters (1:46.09), the 
distance medley (13:00.08), the 400 meters (50.03) and the 1,600 meters 
(4:04.47). 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Fager had the top marks of the day in the high jump (5-4), long jump (6-3) 
and triple jump (38-7). 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Hilary Mann took third in both invitational hurdle events. In the 100 
meters, she ran a 15.3 and in the 300 meters she ran a 46.1. JOHN GEIS

DISPUTED HOMES AND LAND TESTING UNITY OF GERMANS

<TEXT>
<P>
The first time the West German stranger appeared on their doorstep, Thomas and 
Sabine Siede invited him in for coffee and cookies. It was a pleasant visit. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor told the East German couple that their small stone house had been 
his childhood home. His parents built it in 1932. He remembered a Messerschmitt 
fighter crashing in the garden during the war. Later, his family fled to West 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The second time the visitor appeared, he told the Siedes that their doors 
needed refinishing; maybe a wall could be knocked out to enlarge the tiny 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
The third time, he brought a can of paint and brushes. He told the Siedes to 
fix the place up, that he would probably be moving in this summer. 
</P>
<P>
When Siede protested, the West German turned icy. He said: "I've already waited 
40 years. I can wait two or three more." 
</P>
<P>
As the two Germanys move swiftly toward reunification, conflicts like this are 
cropping up with alarming frequency. Nervous East Germans, watching West German 
cars cruise slowly through their neighborhoods, find themselves waiting for 
what has come to be called simply "the visit." 
</P>
<P>
But the question of who owns East Germany goes much deeper, and the visits seem 
to reflect both the arrogance and fear that color the fragile relationship 
between two countries and two peoples struggling to become one. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy touches on something they have always shared, a deeply embedded 
sense of heimat, or home. Yet it also underscores something they have never 
agreed on and suggests that the success of reunification cannot be measured in 
bank notes or ballots or borders. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it may come down to things like a stranger on the doorstep with a can 
of paint. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government estimates that 1 million West Germans could lay claim to 
property the Communist regime seized when they left East Germany. Neither 
government can say with any certainty what belongs to whom, and the issue looms 
as possibly the most complicated and sensitive of all in the process of 
negotiating unification. 
</P>
<P>
Some West Germans are drawn across the fading border by bittersweet memories. 
They just want to look, to reminisce and reconnect. Heimat. 
</P>
<P>
But others come with tape measures, video cameras, time-yellowed deeds and a 
sometimes unsettling determination to take back what they lost so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I would like my property back," Heinrich Wiehemeyer, a 56-year-old 
West German salesman who remembers with fondness his childhood in Rangsdorf, 
said in a recent interview. "My aunt owned the house, and I went to school 
there during the war." 
</P>
<P>
After fleeing west in 1945, the aunt spent the next 36 years writing to East 
German authorities to inquire about the three-bedroom cottage on a dirt lane in 
Rangsdorf. She died nine years ago without ever getting a reply and willed the 
house to Wiehemeyer and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
"And now I want my property," Wiehemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans who believe they bought the house from the state for a 
pittance 17 years ago can stay and pay him a fair rent, he said, "but it is my 
property." 
</P>
<P>
Wiehemeyer, who lives in the West German city of Osnabrueck, compares his 
situation to that of Jews routed by the Nazis during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nazis took away their homes and gave them to other Nazis," Wiehemeyer 
said. "Most of the property seized in East Germany went to Communists. And 
nobody got restitution." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, first the Soviets and then the East German leaders began 
eliminating private property under the slogan "nobility's land to peasant 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, owners who were not forced to give up their land and homes 
had to rent them out at rates too low to cover even routine maintenance. 
Frequently,these people would end up abandoning their property. More often than 
not, the houses fell into disrepair, for under the socialist system there was 
always a shortage of material, capital and skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
In this quiet, woodsy town where the Siedes live, about five miles from the 
West Berlin border, a newly formed citizens' support group estimates that up to 
70% of the 1,800 single-family houses once belonged to people who fled to the 
West. Already, since the first of the year, Rangsdorf has had more than 100 
visits or letters from West German claimants. 
</P>
<P>
People tell of a neighbor who was reassured by a West German owner that he 
would not have to move out but would have to give up one of the two bedrooms 
every summer for the West German's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Reunification means we want to live together," one villager said, "but not 
that together." 
</P>
<P>
The citizens' group began contacting neighboring towns, and efforts to organize 
nationwide are moving quickly ahead. Members are seeking seats on town councils 
in elections scheduled for next month. 
</P>
<P>
When the new Volkskammer, or Parliament, was convened for the first time last 
Thursday, protesters gathered outside to demand housing guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
"German unity cannot allow us to be driven from our homes and gardens," a sign 
carried by one of the protesters said. 
</P>
<P>
Some people scoff at such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just Communist propaganda," said Helmuth Sehrig, a West Berlin lawyer who 
estimates that his firm represents about 1,000 West Germans with some kind of 
property claim in the East. "The old party is trying to stir things up and 
create this needless angst for political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's socialist laws still provide airtight protection for tenants, 
Sehrig said, and no one is going to be forced into homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"Some idiots," he went on, "are going over there like it's the Wild West, 
saying, 'This land's mine, and I want you and your cattle to get off by 
sundown.' But obviously, that's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that in the end, a united Germany will pay out perhaps 
billions of marks in restitution to the old owners, without affecting current 
owners or tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner Oschmann, deputy editor of the Communist daily Neues Deutschland, said: 
"Nobody really knows. Everything is open, and that just heightens the tension. 
It's really a time bomb ticking away." 
</P>
<P>
That's of little comfort to Hartmut Klucke, a 46-year-old physicist who 
believes he bought the Wiehemeyer house from the state in 1973 for 12,000 
marks, about $4,000 at the prevailing exchange rate. On the basis of 
photographs that "a friend in the neighborhood" sent him, Wiehemeyer speculates 
that the property is now worth at least 500,000 marks, about $312,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They as much as stole it," Wiehemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
After getting a series of letters from Wiehemeyer claiming the 2 1/2-bedroom 
house and accusing him of knowingly taking "hot property," Klucke said he 
suffered a near-heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't sleep," his wife, Ursula, said. "He has to take tablets to quiet his 
nerves." 
</P>
<P>
When Wiehemeyer announced that he would be dropping by to inspect the property, 
the Kluckes spent an anxious Saturday peering through the tall hedges ringing 
their yard. But Wiehemeyer did not appear. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrible," Klucke said. "When we moved in, in '73, the house was in 
awful shape. We redid the roof, put in new wooden floors, five new windows and 
made electrical repairs." 
</P>
<P>
Klucke even built a small sauna in the basement. He said poured his savings and 
his free time into the house. 
</P>
<P>
By Western standards, it is hardly a palace. The rooms where Klucke's three 
children slept can barely hold a twin bed. There is a Pullman kitchen and a 
remodeled bathroom. As in most East German homes, there is no telephone. 
</P>
<P>
But the personal touches assert that, to the Kluckes, it is home. The garden 
blooms with pansies and the stairwell is a private gallery of Klucke oil 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the best years here," Ursula Klucke said, "our kids growing up, grandma 
living with us. . . . We even had pet rabbits. Oh, it wouldn't kill me to move, 
but I worry about Hartmut. He practically put this place together stone by 
stone, with his own hands." 
</P>
<P>
Klucke insisted that he has no hatred for Wiehemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Just fear," he said. "I feel so helpless." 
</P>
<P>
When the Kluckes paid off their mortgage last year, they invited friends over 
for a party. Not long afterward the letters started coming. 
</P>
<P>
Not all West Germans are eager to reclaim property in the East. Indeed, some 
fear that reunification and the undoing of the Communist "land reform" could 
saddle them with old mortgages -- and demanding tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Fuchss, a retired lawyer who heads an association of West Germans with 
property claims in the East, finds that many people now want to waive their 
rights as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a place in Leipzig, but I don't want it," Fuchss said. "It's old and 
rotted. I couldn't do anything with it, it's in such awful shape. In some 
cases, it's better to waive all claims in case they decide to give back the 
houses with their unpaid mortgages and all these expensive repairs and 
renovations." 
</P>
<P>
Only a third of East German households are said to have indoor toilets. Homes 
are generally heated with brown coal, which is dirty as well as expensive. 
Scarcities can mean waiting four years for a bathtub or months for a sack of 
cement. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Siede is waiting too, waiting for another visit. He and his wife, both 
38 and both teachers, have not told their two little girls what the West German 
stranger wanted. Their house is cramped, but they pay a typically low East 
German rent to the state -- 94 East marks, or less than $20 a month. 
</P>
<P>
They worry that the severe housing shortage in East Germany and the country's 
economic struggles as it moves into a free-market system will make it 
impossible for them to find a place they can afford if the West German comes 
back for good. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is so worried," Sabine Siede said. "Mrs. Schmidt down the street 
found out from a neighbor that someone with West German license tags drove up 
and started photographing her property." 
</P>
<P>
East Germans, the Siedes pointed out, usually move only once or twice in a 
lifetime, and then to a place assigned and heavily subsidized by a system that 
is now shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"Mobility is foreign to us," said Siede, who like many East Germans refers to 
West Germany as "the other side" in a way that makes it sound much farther 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a political problem or a legal problem, really," he said. "It's a 
social one. We've always been the losers, and the other side has always been 
the winner. They had the money, and they had the property. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't want to lose anymore."

110 DIE IN FERRY BLAZE; CAPTAIN CALLS IT ARSON; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: RESCUERS BEGIN GRISLY SEARCH OF THE DANISH VESSEL AT A SWEDISH PORT. 
ANOTHER 36 PEOPLE ARE MISSING.

<P>
Police and firefighters late Saturday launched what was expected to be a grisly 
all-night search through the still-smoking hull of a North Sea ferry, looking 
for the bodies of victims who died in a possible arson attack on the ship 
during a voyage from Norway to Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters reported finding at least 110 bodies as the stricken 
Danish-operated Scandinavian Star was towed from a point about 30 miles from 
the mouth of the Oslo Fiord to Lysekil, a small port on the west coast of 
Sweden. Another 36 people are missing and believed dead in one of Europe's 
worst ferry disasters since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still rooms in the boat which have not been investigated, and people 
also might be lost at sea," Lysekil Police Chief Roald Onsoe told a news 
conference Saturday night. "There is no more life on board." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an international air and sea rescue involving a score of ships and at 
least seven helicopters managed to carry a reported 321 other ferry passengers 
and crew members to safety in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for VR-DANO Line, the ferry operators, quoted Scandinavian Star 
Captain Hugo Larsen as saying that piles of clothes had been used to set three 
separate fires outside cabins on the vessel, which was on a regularly scheduled 
overnight run from Oslo to Frederikshavn, Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Scandinavian police were apparently taking the report seriously, though there 
was no immediate indication of what the motive for arson might have been. 
</P>
<P>
According to Larsen's account, crew members were able to extinguish two of the 
fires, but the third, on a different deck, raged out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian Star left Oslo at about 11 p.m. local time Friday, 3 1/2 hours 
behind schedule, and first radioed a call for help at 2:30 a.m. Saturday, said 
Lars Kalland, liaison officer for the Maritime Rescue &amp; Coordination Center 
of the Swedish Board of Navigation in Goteborg. 
</P>
<P>
For hours after the tragedy began, sea rescue services were incorrectly 
reporting that all the passengers had been evacuated from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Most passengers were asleep in their cabins when the fire started. A crew of 21 
firefighters from Goteborg, who reached the stricken vessel near dawn, reported 
finding "children and grown-ups lying (dead) in their nightgowns," said Anneka 
Braide, a spokeswoman for the Swedish city's fire service, in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
The victims appeared to have died from smoke inhalation rather than burns, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors said they heard no fire alarm, and they complained that the ship's 
crew knew little about safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asleep, and I woke up because I felt there was the smell of smoke," said 
one woman interviewed on British Broadcasting Corp. television. "And when I 
looked into the corridor, it was full of smoke." She said that crew members 
didn't know how to start the engine on the lifeboat she was aboard. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet ship that picked up 44 survivors was among several craft that rescued 
passengers and took them to various Scandinavian ports. 
</P>
<P>
Braide said that the tragedy might have been far worse had the unpredictable 
North Sea weather not been at its best. The water was calm and the sky blue as 
the still-burning ship was towed toward Lysekil. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's among the most difficult operations you can face as a 
firefighter," Braide commented, "because you have to go deep down into a ship, 
it's dark, the staircases are narrow, it's hot and it's smoke-filled. And so 
it's physically very dangerous and very difficult. And in this case, since 
there are so many deaths, it's also very tough psychological work, that you 
face death everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters tried "to use as little water as possible" in order not to further 
destabilize the already listing ferry and increase the danger that it would 
capsize, the Goteborg fire service spokeswoman added. The metal hull of the 
ship got so hot, she added, that firefighters would no sooner put out one blaze 
than another would flare. 
</P>
<P>
The crippled ferry was finally towed into Lysekil at about 9 p.m. Saturday 
evening, more than 18 hours after first reporting trouble, said Kristina Allen, 
a spokeswoman at the special police incident room set up in the small port. 
</P>
<P>
She said in a telephone interview that "hundreds" of workers were preparing to 
search the ship and remove the bodies of victims. "The plan is that they're 
going to work through tonight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the approximately 400 passengers on the Scandinavian Star were 
reportedly Scandinavian tourists getting an early start on their Easter 
holiday. The crew, numbering about 100, was mostly Portuguese and Filipino. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel carried about 100 automobiles and 14 trucks as well as passengers, 
said the maritime rescue center's Kalland. 
</P>
<P>
The Bahamian-registered ferry is owned by the Danish shipping company VR-DANO 
Line, the Associated Press reported. SeaEscape Ltd. of Miami sold the ship to 
VR-DANO last month, a SeaEscape spokeswoman said in a telephone interview from 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
AP reported that an engine room fire broke out aboard the Scandinavian Star in 
March, 1988, as the vessel sailed from Cozumel, Mexico, to Tampa, Fla. None of 
the 439 passengers on board at that time, most of them Americans, were injured.

<P>
A county grand jury Saturday indicted a Cincinnati museum and its director on 
charges of violating Ohio obscenity laws by exhibiting works by the late 
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not confiscate the photographs, some of which depicted partially 
clothed children. Other photos showed men in sadomasochistic poses. 
</P>
<P>
But Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney urged the downtown Contemporary Arts 
Museum to voluntarily take down seven works that the grand jury deemed obscene. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a possibility that each day this continues could be an added 
criminal action or sanction," Ney told reporters. "I'm not saying there will 
be; I'm saying there could be." 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials vowed, however, that the photographs would not come down. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong with the exhibit," said Dennis Barrie, director of the 
50-year-old arts center. "The show will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Barrie and the arts center were each indicted on two misdemeanor counts of 
pandering obscenity and illegally using a minor in nudity-oriented material. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie, who is to be arraigned next Friday, faces a maximum sentence of one 
year in jail and a fine of $2,000. The arts center faces a maximum fine of 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the shouts of angry arts patrons, police temporarily closed the exhibit 
Saturday afternoon for about 90 minutes while they videotaped the show's 
contents for use as evidence. A crowd of several hundred people, including a 
number of sign-carrying students, sang patriotic songs, jeered at the police 
and chanted slogans such as "Gestapo go home!" and "The whole world is watching 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the arts center had been expecting the police to take some action. 
</P>
<P>
Since Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery canceled a showing of the 
Mapplethorpe photographs last summer the exhibit has contributed to a national 
debate on freedom of expression and federal funding of the arts. Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) has lead the opposition to exhibiting the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati has long had a reputation for strict anti-pornography enforcement, 
and both Police Chief Lawrence Whalen and Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. had previously 
called some of the photographs obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the police might shut down the exhibit or remove some works, the 
arts center filed a lawsuit last month, seeking a ruling that the photographs 
are not obscene by community standards. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton County Muncipal Court Judge Edward Donnellon dismissed the lawsuit for 
lack of legal standing last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the position of being a conservative spokesman in a very conservative 
town, but I believe in freedom of expression," said Roger Ach, president of the 
arts center board. 
</P>
<P>
"The mission (of the arts center) is pretty clear," he said. "We have a mission 
to bring the best and try to exhibit the best, the leading edge of contemporary 
art. Certainly Robert Mapplethorpe and his photographs have been right on that 
leading edge since his work was first recognized." 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Community Values, a local anti-pornography group, was behind much 
of the uproar over the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the chairman of the arts center board resigned because of 
boycotts against his employer, a local bank. A second member of the board also 
resigned "because he had difficulty with the work," Ach acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the show, which has been brewing for several weeks, raised 
attendance levels to extraordinary levels. The 1,600-member arts center also 
got 500 additional members in the two weeks prior to the opening, spokesmen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people paid $10 and stood in line for hours to view 
the exhibit during a private opening Friday night. Arts center spokeswoman Amy 
Bannister said the usually free openings normally draw from 600 to 1,100 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Another 1,700 people poured in during the five hours the show was open to the 
public Saturday before the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
One viewer, Marvin Melzer, said he had never heard of Mapplethorpe before the 
controversy started. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the tragedies going on in the world, people dying, people out of work 
and wondering where they're going to get their next meal, for them to be 
screaming about nine or 10 naughty pictures seems to be something incredible," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The viewers Saturday morning included the nine members of the Hamilton County 
grand jury, county prosecutors and several plainclothes policemen, who paid an 
admission fee to view the show along with members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials, who recognized some of the law enforcement officers, watched 
the detectives anxiously as they inspected the art. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the courthouse, the grand jury determined by early afternoon that 
seven of the 175 photographs on display were obscene. The museum was 
temporarily closed shortly after 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecutor was holding a press conference at the court house. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I find the pertinent photographs personally offensive and obscene, my 
personal feelings have no legal consequence on the grand jury and its 
decision," Ney said in a statement. "The nine members of the grand jury, chosen 
at random from our community, viewed the exhibit as a whole and determined that 
seven photographs violated the obscenity law." 
</P>
<P>
Because of concern over the show's content, explicit photographs depicting 
sadomasochistic sex are being shown in a separate gallery and no one under age 
18 is being admitted. Nudes and photographs with sexual content, however, are 
scattered throughout the exhibit.

'91 INTELLIGENCE BUDGET STILL TARGETS EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Bush Administration's classified intelligence budget for 1991 calls for a 
record $30 billion in secret funding and, despite the recent political changes 
in the East Bloc, more than half of the funds target the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, whose contents are closely guarded, is pending before Congress and 
is expected to be approved with only a few amendments. However, sources said, 
its continued emphasis on intelligence gathering in Eastern Europe has ignited 
a behind-the-scenes debate about the direction and nature of such U.S. efforts 
in a rapidly changing world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Cold War budget that ignores the new realities," grumbled one U.S. 
official close to the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Even critics of Bush Administration foreign policy do not dispute the need for 
a vigorous U.S. intelligence effort. America's inability to fully anticipate 
many of the developments in the Communist world has only deepened support for 
wide-ranging intelligence gathering to monitor continuing turbulence and change 
across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the $300-billion defense budget from which it is carved, the 
intelligence spending plan is not being scrutinized for significant reductions. 
The budget includes proposed funding for the CIA, the ultra-secret National 
Security Agency and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency. At $30 billion, 
it was described by sources as a moderate increase over this year's secret 
funding level. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a number of officials are voicing concern that the intelligence 
community should now direct greater attention -- and money -- to threats not 
rooted in the East-West rivalry, threats such as the proliferation of chemical 
and biological weapons, religious-ethnic conflicts in the Third World, Latin 
America's frail new democracies and transnational trends such as narcotics and 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the opportunities that arises with the demise of the Warsaw Pact is the 
opportunity to address the long-term issues of North-South concerns in Africa 
and Latin America," said Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), a member of the House 
Intelligence Committee. "It's time to start the transition." 
</P>
<P>
Even staunch supporters of the secret budget have suggested that some shifts 
are needed, notably toward improving human intelligence-gathering and 
counterintelligence capabilities downgraded in the 1970s by the Jimmy Carter 
Administration in favor of high-priced technology such as spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"As we move into the twilight zone of a lessened threat of land war in Europe, 
our dangers are not less, just diffused and possibly from different areas," 
said Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We may need some reallocation to be done to avoid the gold-plated systems in 
favor of the nitty-gritty," Hyde said. "We have so much intelligence from 
satellites that we can't even read it all." 
</P>
<P>
In light of the political upheavals that caught the Bush Administration 
off-guard, others have called for reexamining the fundamental premises of 
national security priorities, the subjects of covert and overt operations, and 
the methods of intelligence collection. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past 40 years, we've been in a political war of attrition," said Roy 
Godson, a professor of government at Georgetown University and an intelligence 
specialist. "A long line was drawn, which moved a little but basically held. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there is no danger of one-power domination. And now we're in a much 
different war of maneuver where forces and factions are no longer stationery, 
they're very fluid," he added. "This requires much more sophisticated 
intelligence than we've had in the past." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's continued preoccupation with the East Bloc has sparked 
some pointed questions among lawmakers and analysts, particularly about the 
need to spy on countries that are undergoing democratic elections and to which 
the United States has pledged or discussed economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we doing in Poland? Spying on Walesa? And in Czechoslovakia, spying 
on Havel?" CIA officials reportedly were asked at a recent hearing on the 
proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Central Intelligence William H. Webster recently conceded that the 
Soviet KGB has become "less confrontational" and that secret police in East 
Bloc nations "are in turmoil" as former hard-line regimes have been swept from 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the CIA director said in a speech two weeks ago that espionage and 
counterintelligence are widely recognized in Eastern Europe as "necessary 
functions." 
</P>
<P>
"The apparatus for this work is likely to remain in place," he said. "The 
intelligence and counterintelligence services may be reorganized and 
resubordinated to newly elected masters instead of the party bosses, but the 
work will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Webster also noted that Warsaw Pact commitments require East European 
intelligence services to cooperate with the Soviets and that fundamental 
changes in intelligence missions are not likely while the alliance remains 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
The methods used to collect intelligence are a second source of debate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed budget calls for elimination of a major satellite program 
focused primarily on the Soviet Union, critics contend that an even greater 
reallocation is necessary to improve the nation's human intelligence-gathering 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, at least we knew who our enemies were, and we could use our 
technology to count their tanks and missiles," said Godson, the Georgetown 
University professor. "But now we're not even sure who our enemies are. 
</P>
<P>
"Distinguishing friend from foe will be one of the key challenges for 
intelligence in the 1990s," he said. "And intelligence by machines is not 
enough to interpret the nuances of change -- in the Soviet Union and 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Webster has conceded that human-generated intelligence needs to be enhanced. 
"While in physical numbers now, we're about where we were before the major cuts 
in the late 1970s, the needs have grown," he said in December. 
</P>
<P>
A third area under scrutiny is the CIA's covert intelligence program, 
particularly two longstanding operations that some critics charge are outdated 
in light of recent world changes. 
</P>
<P>
The first involves the Administration's request to increase aid to 
Afghanistan's moujahedeen rebels to about $315 million, 14 months after the 
Soviets withdrew their troops from the nation. The U.S. program is supplemented 
by even larger amounts of U.S.-solicited funds from Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
CIA assessments, meanwhile, indicate that the Soviets are unlikely to invade 
Afghanistan again in the near future and that various rebel groups under the 
moujahedeen umbrella are deeply divided. "We're throwing money into this 
program without even knowing what we want out of it," said a source familiar 
with the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Also in dispute is a covert operation in Angola. The budget proposes increasing 
aid to rebel leader Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola (UNITA) by about $4 million to almost $50 million, despite the 
Administration's public pledge to support peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In recent closed-door debate, Administration officials conceded that the 50,000 
Cuban troops deployed since the mid-1970s to aid the government of Angolan 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos are leaving on schedule. They also 
acknowledged that Secretary of State James A. Baker III had a "good and 
productive" meeting with Dos Santos in Namibia last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration argues, however, that Savimbi needs additional military 
hardware and other aid to maintain a negotiating edge over the Marxist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts suggest that Bush may be using the intelligence budget to 
serve his own ends, conceding to right-wing supporters on Savimbi and the 
moujahedeen in exchange for their backing on other programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I question whether we couldn't use the proposed increases (in Afghanistan and 
Angola) for intelligence in other parts of the world that may present future 
dangers. As it is, we're living in the past," said a source familiar with the 
budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth concern is the nation's counterintelligence capability, which 
re-emerged as an issue in the mid-1980s and led to the expansion last year of 
the Counterintelligence Center based at the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, however, the United States has been embarrassed by two major 
counterintelligence failures. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, senior U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch was followed for months and 
later dismissed from the State Department after being suspected of providing 
intelligence to the Soviet Union for several years. And U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde 
Lee Conrad was charged last year with stealing top-secret NATO war plans for 
Hungary and Czechoslovakia dating back to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Both critics and supporters of the budget are also calling for greater 
attention in the 1990s to a comparatively new area -- economic intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"As the arms race is winding down, the spy race is heating up," Senate 
Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren (D-Okla.) said in a National 
Press Club speech last week. 
</P>
<P>
"And where is the growth area in this espionage activity? An increasing share 
of the espionage directed against the United States comes from spying against 
private American companies, aimed at stealing commercial secrets to gain an 
economic advantage, as opposed to the theft of military secrets to build 
military strengths in other countries," Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Webster acknowledged: "In the 1990s, as countries focus more on 
economic competitiveness, what will be sought is sensitive information that 
will give a country a competitive edge." 
</P>
<P>
Webster implied that a shift in intelligence priorities could affect 
traditional U.S. alliances. "Political and military allies are also our 
economic competitors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, on each of the issues now being scrutinized, the CIA appears to be 
feeling less heat than the White House and State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Webster is widely seen as the first key Administration official to 
recognize the declining Soviet threat. He has acknowledged publicly that 
because of Moscow's economic problems, a land war with the Soviets in Europe 
would remain unlikely even if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was replaced by 
hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
"In the midst of all this change, we don't seem to have any direction from 
either the White House or State," said an official close to the budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some very important basic decisions need to be made about how intelligence 
programs support foreign policy," the official said. "Those are not for the CIA 
to make. They're up to State and the President. Opportunities are going to 
waste all over the world."

FEINSTEIN SUPPORT OF DEATH PENALTY DRAWS PARTY BOOS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SHE SAYS DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION DELEGATES ARE OUT OF STEP WITH THE 
PUBLIC OVER CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Figuring she would never win the endorsement of the state Democratic 
convention's liberal-leaning delegates, Dianne Feinstein chose to antagonize 
them Saturday -- flaunting her support for capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I support the death penalty. It is an issue that cannot be fudged or 
hedged," the candidate for governor said in her address to delegates. 
</P>
<P>
A gale of boos drowned out the last words of her sentence, and the racket 
continued for nearly 30 seconds as she stared, unblinking, into the eye of 
cameras recording the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor of San Francisco later held a press conference and rubbed in 
the fact that the convention delegates are one of the few identifiable segments 
of society with a strong bent against capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am more mainstream than has been the philosophy of the Democratic 
Party; I think I'm a lot tougher on crime," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, The Los Angeles Times Poll has found that delegates oppose capital 
punishment 3 to 2 while Democratic voters in general favor it 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's showy confrontation was one unexpected development Saturday as the 
campaign's war of the airwaves came down to earth and she and her rival, John 
K. Van de Kamp, stepped from behind their million-dollar television commercials 
and faced the party rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 77 years, thanks to a new legal opening, the Democratic 
Party of California was to vote today on a possible endorsement. But the 60% 
majority required by party rules was deliberately designed to make it tough. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who has never really participated before in state party affairs, 
said she never expected to earn that kind of support from the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
It was not all quarrelsome for Feinstein, however. With the help of a 
160-person rooting section of observers, which her campaign brought into the 
convention at a cost of $35 each per ticket, she was cheered heartily when she 
spoke of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, for the first time, a woman stands before you as a candidate for 
governor. . . . Let's make history," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In his address, Van de Kamp received only ho-hum silence when he turned to 
capital punishment -- which he says he personally opposes but will carry out 
under California law. "Yes, I think that some of us disagree with the death 
penalty," he said. "But I respect the fact that the people have spoken." 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general earned his share of cheers, though, with a rendition 
of good old fashioned, crowd-pleasing Democratic principles -- health care for 
the poor, job safety for workers, shelter for the homeless and devotion to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he hoped to receive better than a majority vote of the 
delegates today but probably not the 60% needed for an endorsement. "I have 
said all along we would do well to receive half," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although they could not resist a couple of digs at each other, Feinstein and 
Van de Kamp for a change saved most of their vinegar for U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, 
the leading Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp: "If we want to change California, we must defeat this man who will 
ride to battle clothed in the power of the status quo and armed with the money 
of the special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "In nine years (as mayor) we balanced nine budgets -- a record 
George Bush and Ronald Reagan only wish they had. And let's look at Sen. Pete 
Wilson. In seven years as a senator, he voted seven times for unbalanced 
budgets." 
</P>
<P>
Beleaguered Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston's speech was generally well received 
by the convention, although occasional heckling could be heard in the 
convention hall. 
</P>
<P>
As he has repeatedly, Cranston declared his intent to stay in politics and seek 
reelection in 1992 despite the continuing investigations of his assistance for 
Charles H. Keating Jr., head of bankrupt Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and a major 
Cranston political contributor. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not turn tail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The convention, which began late and fell hours behind schedule, lumbered into 
the late afternoon before beginning the first of two debates for candidates 
seeking offices below the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
All five major Democratic candidates for state insurance commissioner promised 
to meet the terms of the insurance reform Proposition 103 and eliminate rate 
differentials based on where a driver lives. Such a move would certainly result 
in reduced insurance costs in urban areas but perhaps at the expense of 
suburban and rural motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The compressed format of the debate allowed only the shortest "sound bites" of 
thoughts. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
From state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), who has ignored most previous 
debates. "I have a 16-year record as a problem solver." 
</P>
<P>
Conway Collis, a member of the State Board of Equalization and the candidate 
favored by the chief sponsor of Proposition 103. "I won't be fair to an 
industry that's unfair to Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zelman, former director of Common Cause. "I've spent my political life 
representing people who couldn't afford lobbyists." 
</P>
<P>
Television commentator Bill Press. "There isn't one special interest I haven't 
taken on. I've even taken on the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Bourhis, a dark horse but persistent campaigner and a lawyer who represents 
claimants against insurance companies. "We need new passion. . . . We need new 
blood. . . . We need someone who knows this industry." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi gave part of his time to a sixth candidate who had not been scheduled 
to participate because he is not considered to be a major candidate. Alhambra 
Councilman Michael Blanco used the time to note that he is the only candidate 
to support no-fault auto insurance to reduce insurance rates: "My slogan is 
this -- vote for Blanco for no fault. Anyone else and it's your fault." 
</P>
<P>
In the first ballot Saturday night, none of the insurance commissioner 
candidates won the 60% majority required for endorsement. The results were not 
immediately released, but a second ballot was scheduled for today among the top 
finishers.

DEMOCRATS CONVENTION -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hard to figure what was more incongruous as the state Democratic Party 
gathered downtown Saturday -- the sight of perennially buttoned-down John K. 
Van de Kamp strutting into the Convention Center to the tune of "Johnny B. 
Goode" or the painted blue skies and fluffy clouds curtain that backed a stage 
of fussing and feuding politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyful," intoned Jacques Barzaghi, the baldpated guru of convention visuals, 
when asked to explain the meaning of the 3-stories-tall painted curtain, 15 
live trees and dozens of flags that draped the stage. "Happy." 
</P>
<P>
It was only those emotions if one ignored the occasional mayhem between the two 
gubernatorial candidates, Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein, and the fraternal bludgeoning by other candidates competing 
for the party's weekend endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, what all conventions are: equal parts speechifying and 
back-patting, orderly structure and unyielding disorganization, irreverent 
hokeyness and blinding optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Major candidates paraded through the convention area with their entourages of 
aides; volunteers unleashed blizzards of partisan flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Minor figures such as Franklin R. Geraty -- a much-ignored gubernatorial 
candidate who said he was "working to bring back family values" -- competed for 
space with celebrities such as actor Ed Begley Jr., an environmental activist 
and mass transit booster who apologetically admitted he still owns a car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up for sale," he said Saturday morning, wincing. "You want to buy a nice 
Volvo?" 
</P>
<P>
If the mood the Democrats tried to espouse was all chumminess and success, 
there was ample evidence that not all was well. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was roundly booed when, in a convention address, she spoke of her 
support for the death penalty. She and Van de Kamp exchanged veiled snaps at 
each other while former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. pleaded publicly for the two 
to cool their increasingly heated war. 
</P>
<P>
There were also reminders of the party's past disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
Along a promenade of tables groaning under heaps of position papers and 
souvenirs, delegates could pick up memorabilia left over from some of the least 
successful endeavors in political history: buttons from Michael S. Dukakis' 
1988 and Hubert H. Humphrey's 1968 presidential efforts or a long-expired 
membership in George S. McGovern's 1972 Million Member club. 
</P>
<P>
Best-sellers were predictable. "Kennedy, of course," said Max Hobbs, a 
political souvenir seller, pointing to remnants from John F. Kennedy's campaign 
of 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis buttons, he explained gently, were not much in demand. "There are so 
many of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As conventions go, this weekend's was far smaller than the Democratic national 
convention that ushered in Kennedy's nomination in 1960 at the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena. Little more than 1,100 of the 2,700 delegates showed up, although 
party officials did receive the proxies of about 500 others, according to party 
chairman Brown. He blamed the small turnout on the expense and travel 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The convention did, however, live up to the party's reputation for, well, 
disorganization. Saturday's first session opened more than an hour late, and 
voting on endorsements threatened to last late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a showcase for elected officials and party leaders, but 
they did not always fare well amid the gibes of their peers. At a morning 
breakfast for environmental activists, state Controller Gray Davis thanked 
absent entertainers who work on behalf of environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Including, he said, turning to Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), "your 
ex-spouse there, Jane Fonda." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden reddened and stared ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, he got in a slap of his own. Segueing from a reference about 
wildlife to his introduction of Brown, Hayden cracked: "Speaking of bald 
eagles." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 52 on Saturday and his hair a tad thinner than when he left the 
governor's office eight years ago, did not appear amused.

TREES AND HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY COEXIST IN PALO ALTO, WHERE COFFEE COSTS LESS IF 
YOU BRING A MUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PALO ALTO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a tree-shaded street of $500,000 homes, neatly tied stacks of newspapers and 
burlap sacks bulging with empty cans lie waiting for the weekly recycling truck 
in front of environmentally landscaped yards. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling has been going strong here for almost 20 years, but xeriscaping -- 
using drought-tolerant plants so yards need less watering -- is all the rage 
these dry days. 
</P>
<P>
In Palo Alto, birthplace of the Silicon Valley's computer industry and home of 
Earth Day headquarters, the fascination with high-tech is matched by a 
commitment to a high quality of life and devotion to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen and women pedal to work on a 30-mile network of bike lanes, 
cruising past houses topped by solar energy panels. 
</P>
<P>
Snowy egrets and great blue herons soar above marshes, and ducks splash in a 
pond in the city's cherished baylands. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of deer graze the hillside meadows of the city's 1,500-acre Foothills 
Park. Mountain lions, bobcats and 11 species of snakes roam freely in the 
hills, and 150 kinds of birds delight hikers and picnickers. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Zinn takes a break every day around noon to feed bread to ground 
squirrels in the baylands. The normally skittish creatures, who live in 8-foot 
deep burrows, let Zinn pet them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're kind of like my family," Zinn said. "I was a still photographer in 
Hollywood and when I came back to this area I was worried that this whole place 
would be condominiums. I sure am glad they preserved all this." 
</P>
<P>
While 75% of the wetlands around San Francisco Bay have been filled in over the 
years, Palo Altans have worked to preserve their edge of the bay since the 
1920s and have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain its natural 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"Wetlands are one of the most productive land forms in terms of wildlife," said 
Emily Renzel, a City Council member who has led protection efforts. "Many 
animal species depend on them. To the extent that we are crowding out major 
segments of the animal population, we're just setting ourselves up for disaster 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
"Slowly but surely we're creating a world in which we may be the only ones 
existing, and it may not be a very pretty world. I don't think we want to be in 
a world without birds singing." 
</P>
<P>
Palo Alto is not without problems, of course. High-tech companies sometimes 
leak toxic chemicals, and older buildings waste too much energy. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a small city with a big reputation, a pioneer in recycling since 
1971, a center for solar energy research and a model of environmental 
responsibility for cities of any size. 
</P>
<P>
It has won national awards for its bicycling and recycling programs, 
waste-water treatment and hazardous-waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway between the gray fog of San Francisco and the brown smog of San Jose, 
Palo Alto is seen in aerial photographs as a patch of green. A thick canopy of 
trees enriches the air with oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
The redwood El Palo Alto -- "the tall tree" used as a landmark by Spanish 
explorers in 1769 -- still stands nobly, though thin on top and slightly 
stooped. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 56,000 that grew up around that tree and bucolic Stanford 
University has developed a passion for trees, especially after watching apricot 
and cherry orchards give way to aerospace, communications and electronic 
companies in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's computerized tree inventory, 32,089 city-owned trees -- 
the most popular are magnolias with big white blossoms -- line the streets. 
Perhaps 10 to 15 times as many are privately owned, including birches, 
eucalyptuses and orange, lemon, plum, pear and almond trees that flourish in 
the Mediterranean climate of mild, moist winters and warm, dry summers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Magic Forest, a small stand of redwoods in one of the city's more than 
50 parks, the air is as cool and refreshing as in the wilds of Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
For many Palo Altans, though, their view of the environment extends beyond the 
beauty of the land and the quality of the air and water, said Denis Hayes, 
Earth Day founder and a resident of Palo Alto, off and on, for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"When a bunch of us were involved in trying to build a new environmental 
movement in the late '60s and early '70s," he said, "the search was really for 
an all-encompassing set of values, a new ideology relevant to the 20th 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
A top priority, he said, was a desire to stop deterioration of the planet and 
encourage peace, justice and education. 
</P>
<P>
In that broad context, he said, "Palo Alto is in many ways an idyllic kind of 
community. It aspires to become a new Athens. It really does promote that 
vision in the sense of having large democratic involvements in (national and 
international) statecraft and doing what it can to encourage art and 
athletics." 
</P>
<P>
No environmental danger escapes notice and no waste is tolerated in this city, 
where more than 70% of residents and 24 of the 30 leading generators of 
commercial waste participate regularly in recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, glass, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, corrugated cardboard, used 
motor oil, scrap metal, high-grade paper, mattresses, yard debris and used car 
batteries are collected either curbside or at drop-off centers. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the City Council is expected to pass the nation's first toxic gas 
ordinance -- drafted by the Santa Clara County fire departments with help from 
Silicon Valley computer chip companies, environmentalists and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
It is designed to control releases of poisonous gases and add enough safeguards 
to prevent a "Bhopal, India, type of disaster," said Fire Marshal Phil 
Constantino. The model ordinance, under study by dozens of other cities, is a 
follow-up to a hazardous materials storage law, also the first in the nation, 
adopted by Palo Alto and neighboring cities in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council prohibited all places that serve food from using 
containers made with ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Downtown 
coffee shops offer coffee at 20 cents off for patrons who bring their own mugs 
instead of using Styrofoam cups. 
</P>
<P>
Another ordinance, banning all non-recyclable, disposable polystyrene and rigid 
plastic food service items, is to go into effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
By the same date, auto service shops will be required to have equipment to 
capture the CFC-laden Freon that escapes during air conditioning repairs. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, retail stores were required to offer a choice of paper or plastic 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
Houses are expensive in Palo Alto -- three-bedroom houses range from $300,000 
to $1 million -- but gas and electricity rates are generally at least 30% lower 
than the rest of the Bay Area, thanks to a city-owned utilities system. 
</P>
<P>
Palo Alto Utilities, the only municipal agency in the state that provides gas, 
electricity and water, offers customers free analyses of energy and water use, 
as well as low-interest loans to install solar systems. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 1980 Census, 14% of Palo Altans working there rode bicycles to 
their jobs. The current Census is expected to show a big increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The more bicyclists you have, the fewer cars you have," said Ellen Fletcher, a 
former council member and longtime bicycling advocate. "That reduces the 
pollutants in the air, the traffic and the need for more parking lots." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher helped push through laws requiring companies with more than 50 
employees to provide showers and bicycle parking spaces. She is urging the city 
to create a network of bicycle boulevards to make it easier to ride around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a tough competition with the automobile," she said. "The ultimate 
goal should be to make it as convenient to bicycle as it is to drive, and we 
haven't quite gotten to that stage." 
</P>
<P>
One progressive Palo Alto drug research company, Alza Corp., pays employees up 
to $60 a month for using public transportation or $1 a day if they bike, jog, 
walk or ride in car pools to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary concern as a company is an environmental one," said Alza executive 
Peter Carpenter. "Paying people not to drive and providing them with bike 
lockers and showers is also cheaper than building more parking spaces for cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of subsidizing cars, we're subsidizing alternatives. It's the free 
market approach. We're giving people an incentive to leave their cars home." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Carpenter admits, somewhat sheepishly, "I still drive 90% of the time 
myself, which is horrible. . . . That's the acid test, when you can get people 
like me to stop talking about getting out of their cars and start doing it."

GLOBAL WARMING FORECASTS TEMPERED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: DIRE PREDICTIONS ARE BEING TONED DOWN AND, SOME SCIENTISTS SAY, 
NOT ALL THE CHANGES WILL BE BAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The most dire predictions about global warming are being toned down by many 
experts, who now predict that temperatures and sea levels in the next century 
will not rise as dramatically as once feared. 
</P>
<P>
While climate researchers tend to agree that our grandchildren will inherit a 
warmer world, many scientists are now betting on an average warming of only 
three or four degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, the low end 
of a range that prognosticators once put as high as nine degrees. 
</P>
<P>
A rise in sea level, one of the most feared consequences of global warming, 
also is expected to be far less drastic than previously thought, largely 
because of the surprising observation that the polar ice sheets are not 
melting, but growing in size. According to Mark Meier of the Institute of 
Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, the consensus now is 
that sea level will rise by about a foot in the next century, rather than the 
three feet that had been suggested in previous studies. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the revised forecast is correct, there would be major effects, the 
scientists warn. A one-foot rise in sea level would inundate some shorelines, 
moving the water's edge inland by hundreds or thousands of feet. And a global 
warming of only a few degrees might upset communities of plants and animals 
that have developed over millennia. Weather patterns also could change, meaning 
more frequent droughts and severe storms. 
</P>
<P>
Yet along with the new forecasts are indications that not all changes will be 
bad. Some researchers have begun to stress that a warmer, wetter world might be 
welcome in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an interesting point that people ought to think about more. By and 
large, there are positive effects. More wheat in the Ukraine. Thinner ice in 
the Arctic. Better winters in Moscow. But at the same time, you're building up 
a bigger time bomb that is becoming harder and harder to dismantle," said John 
Perry, staff director of the Board of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate at the 
National Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
Perry points to a recent study by the climate office of National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration that concluded that a slightly warmer, wetter world 
would increase food production, enhance forest growth and enlarge water 
supplies. An obvious drawback was that billions of dollars would have to be 
spent protecting coastal areas from rising seas. 
</P>
<P>
The great uncertainty in predicting global warming and its effects is making 
life difficult for government policy-makers. The computer models upon which all 
forecasts are based are generated by a small group of scientists who 
acknowledge that they do not understand or even recognize all the variables 
that affect their predictions, thus compounding policy uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
"The things we can say with confidence, the policy-makers are not interested 
in. And the things the policy-makers are interested in, we don't know with much 
confidence," said Jerry Mahlman, director of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
"Modelers have been thrust into the limelight way too soon," said Richard 
Cooper, an economist at Harvard University. "They don't have models today you 
can build public policy on." 
</P>
<P>
The frustration was evident at a meeting Cooper and Mahlman attended recently 
at the National Academy of Sciences, where an expert panel was grappling with 
the policy implications of global warming. After a long afternoon, during which 
the invited scientists displayed graphs with past and future temperatures 
bouncing up and down like rubber balls, they were finally begged to put aside 
the carefully hedged forecasts and simply make a "best guess." While the ranges 
of guesses varied, the favorite seemed to be a four-degree increase by the 
middle of the next century, when concentrations of carbon dioxide gas -- which 
contributes to the "greenhouse effect" -- are expected to double. 
</P>
<P>
One reason many researchers are shying away from the worst-case scenarios so 
popular a year ago has to do with the climate record itself. While researchers 
argue that the oldest records are highly suspect, in general they agree that 
temperatures have risen over the past 100 years by about a degree. But there 
are tremendous arguments over whether or not this increase is due to an 
accumulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap 
heat close to Earth. Instead it may be the result of some other climatic cycle 
unrelated to human activity. But whatever its cause, the temperature record is 
more consistent with a rise of four degrees, rather than nine degrees, by the 
middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"The new runs do favor the lower estimate," said Warren Washington of the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research, another top climate modeler. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most recent climate simulations, done by the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab 
at Princeton, suggest slightly lower temperature increases, according to the 
scientists who run them. 
</P>
<P>
Both models showed uneven warming in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. In 
one run, the region around the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica did not 
warm at all. The model showed it cooling, thanks to improved simulations of how 
the ocean currents circulate and mix. Another world-class model, run by the 
United Kingdom Meteorological Office, cuts temperature rises in half when the 
researchers change the way raindrops are represented. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all the climate modelers agree with the lower estimates. One is 
James Hansen of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies in New York. Hansen said he thinks his model and 
the observed temperature record are still in keeping with a greater future 
increase in temperatures. At the meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, 
Hansen stated again that he thinks warming associated with increased greenhouse 
gases has already begun and that the Earth will warm by more than four degrees 
on average in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
All the modelers stress how uncertain the forecasts are. "People are hedging," 
Washington said. "You get put into a defensive position, because everyone wants 
the lower estimates." 
</P>
<P>
Given all the uncertainties, what is known for sure? It is agreed that carbon 
dioxide has increased over the last 100 years. Since 1958, when accurate 
surveys were begun, carbon dioxide has increased from 316 parts per million 
parts of air to 353 parts per million today, an 11% increase. This accumulation 
is attributed primarily to the burning of fossil fuels, of which the United 
States is the largest user. 
</P>
<P>
The basic phenomena of the greenhouse effect are also agreed upon. It has been 
operating for millions of years and is one reason Earth is as warm as it is. In 
the last few months, the greenhouse effect was actually measured for the first 
time by University of Chicago researchers who used satellites to measure 
radiation coming into the atmosphere and bouncing back out to space. 
</P>
<P>
So it is almost universally agreed that Earth probably will warm as carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases accumulate. How much it warms is the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lindzen, one of the most outspoken critics of current projections, 
conceded at the recent meeting that temperatures probably will rise, but not by 
much. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor said he thinks the 
planet will respond to the buildup of greenhouse gases by producing "negative 
feedbacks," such as high, dry clouds, that will lift warmed air from the ground 
toward the upper atmosphere where its heat will radiate into space, 
counteracting a warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers tend to think that while Hansen's projections may be too hot, 
Lindzen's are definitely too cold. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say it may take another decade or more to settle the issues. At 
present, the most common response by government officials and scientists has 
been a call for more research and a push to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide 
by increasing energy efficiency -- a painless remedy that would provide 
benefits regardless of future temperatures.

<TEXT>
<P>
The army took complete control of this embattled capital and several major 
suburbs Saturday to enforce an unprecedented 24-hour curfew and stall a popular 
uprising for democracy that is threatening Asia's oldest monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Chinese-made armored personnel carriers, bristling with weapons, 
patrolled Katmandu's deserted streets throughout the day. Crack combat troops 
manned machine-gun positions around King Birendra's palace, near the scene of 
Friday's bloody urban violence, the worst in Katmandu's modern history. 
</P>
<P>
Troops manned checkpoints, blockaded most major intersections and guarded 
government installations, forming a ring around the city 12 miles in diameter. 
Army helicopters flew over the nation's main university campus, where the 
pro-democracy movement began nearly eight weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was the capital's first curfew in at least three decades, and most of 
Katmandu's largely illiterate population did not even understand it, despite 
hourly broadcasts on state-run radio that anyone violating it would be shot on 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Three "curfew violators" were shot dead by soldiers in the suburb of Patan on 
Saturday. Several reliable sources said that one of the victims was an elderly 
woman who was going to a local well for water. Another was a woman shot on her 
balcony after witnessing the first killing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, where the curfew was not in effect, protest marches 
and demonstrations continued Saturday, as did retaliatory firing by riot 
troops, according to diplomats and other sources. No casualty figures were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
In the capital, however, the human toll was rising from Friday's police assault 
on pro-democracy demonstrators. At Bir Hospital, where nine of the scores of 
people reported killed by gunfire had died, doctors were running short of food 
for their patients. Among those at the hospital were 102 people seriously 
wounded in the carnage near the king's palace. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors also complained that the army was keeping ambulances from entering and 
leaving the compound and barring relief employees for the exhausted staff from 
reaching hospital grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Katmandu's international airport was effectively closed all day, and thousands 
of foreigners in this popular tourist mecca were stranded and confined to their 
hotels. The army refused to issue curfew passes or let civilian vehicles move 
between the city and airport. No flights had landed or left the Himalayan 
kingdom for more than 36 hours as of 7 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's overpowering military presence led to rumors that the army may even 
have taken power from the king, Nepal's supreme military commander, who was not 
seen or heard on government broadcast media all day. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's a coup or not, it's my sense that the army has fully taken over 
now," one longtime foreign resident of Nepal said. "The question now is, will 
they help or will they create a civil war situation." 
</P>
<P>
A senior diplomat here rejected such speculation. "It's not a question at all 
of the army having taken over in a military coup. The army is very loyal," the 
diplomat said of the 40,000-strong force that has supported and defended 
Nepal's 250-year-old monarchy. "What they are providing is a shield . . . for 
the political process." 
</P>
<P>
There were several attempts at direct negotiations between pro-democracy 
leaders and three of the four Cabinet ministers whom the king has appointed to 
replace a hard-line government he dismissed Friday morning in an attempt to 
defuse the growing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Birendra's new prime minister, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, met with Ganesh Man 
Singh, the ailing leader of the banned Nepali Congress Party, in Singh's 
hospital room Saturday. But Congress leaders said that Chand described it as "a 
courtesy call," adding that Singh repeated his determination to keep the 
protests going. 
</P>
<P>
"The popular movement will continue with greater vigor, intensity and 
dimension," Singh vowed in a public statement. Congress Party leaders, as well 
as representatives of seven Communist parties that are helping to lead the mass 
uprising, have insisted they will not even discuss ending the protests until 
the king publicly agrees to a multi-party system in Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal's kings have ruled with virtually unchecked power since Birendra's 
father, King Mahendra, used the army to stage a palace coup in 1960, jailing 
all of the elected officials and Cabinet ministers. When the pro-democracy 
movement began in February this year, it was largely confined to students, 
radical Communists and the same Congress Party leaders Mahendra had arrested 30 
years ago, among them Singh. But the leaders repeatedly said they were seeking 
a constitutional monarchy that would merely dilute the king's power. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the movement has won widespread support from virtually every 
sector of Nepal's professional society. The demonstration that led to Friday's 
bloodshed resembled a popular revolt, involving tens of thousands of doctors, 
lawyers, engineers, professors, civil servants, farmers, factory workers and 
homemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Saturday's failed attempt at negotiations, which took place after 
the king freed many pro-democracy leaders from house arrest and prisons that 
have held up to 5,000 political prisoners since the movement began, one 
diplomat conceded that "it is at an impasse." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the king would yield to the movement's main demands, he 
added: "(The kings) have survived for 250 years. . . . If push comes to shove, 
pragmatism will be very much alive." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residents of the Katmandu Valley faced greater hardship. Most are so 
poor they can afford to shop only a day at a time, and with stores closed by 
the curfew, families were running out of food. Moreover, they had no idea why. 
There is no Nepali word for curfew, and few here have ever heard the English 
word. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never experienced a thing such as this before," said one Nepalese 
businessman. "We are all running short of everything -- even medicines -- and 
no one knows when it will end."

SIX INDUSTRIALIZED POWERS REJECT AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO CALM JAPANESE 
MARKETS; 
</P>
<P>
GLOBAL ECONOMY: BUT THE DOOR IS LEFT OPEN FOR A MODEST INTERVENTION TO HELP 
STABILIZE THE YEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top economic policy makers of the major industrialized nations Saturday 
rebuffed a bid by Japan for a major new international effort to calm the 
turbulent Tokyo financial markets, but they left the door open to possible 
modest intervention in the currency markets to help stabilize the yen. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, the finance ministers and central bankers of the 
organization known informally as the Group of Seven declined a Japanese request 
that they reduce interest rates in their own countries -- or intervene 
massively in the foreign-currency markets -- to help Japan avoid having to 
raise its own interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that could presage some token intervention, the group issued a brief 
communique that warned that the yen's recent decline could have "undesirable 
consequences" for the effort to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. And it called 
generally for "greater stability" in the currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. and foreign analysts interpreted the wording mainly as a 
face-saving gesture for the Japanese that did not imply either major 
intervention or interest-rate changes by the six other members of the Group of 
Seven -- the United States, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
J. Paul Horne, the Paris-based chief economist of the Smith Barney Harris Upham 
investment firm, said the other countries' conspicuous refusal to rescue Japan 
reflected their view that the financial turmoil in Japan "is clearly a Japanese 
problem," brought on by Tokyo's recent failure to combat inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Stoga, manager of Kissinger Associates, a New York consulting firm, 
agreed. Stoga said Saturday's statement -- which he termed "about as weak as it 
can be" -- would have to be backed up by heavy intervention on Monday and 
Tuesday to have any credibility in the foreign-exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
Stoga also predicted that the refusal of the ministers to provide the bold 
international rescue effort that Japan had been seeking would force Tokyo to 
raise its interest rates very soon now. He said Saturday's action seemed 
intended partly to provide "a political cover" for Tokyo to act. 
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Group of Seven not to move more visibly reflected a series 
of internal differences, both among top U.S. economic policy makers and between 
the United States and West Germany, the two Group of Seven members that might 
have had sufficient clout to help stem the yen's decline. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bush Administration initially had seemed willing to go further to 
accommodate Japan, the independent Federal Reserve Board -- which must 
acquiesce for any such deal to go through -- and, more recently, the White 
House and the State Department, all had opposed any cut in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
That position marked a turnabout for the White House, which until only recently 
had been pressing the Fed to reduce interest rates at home. Policy makers said 
the White House now agrees with the Fed that lowering rates now would risk 
sparking a backlash that could push market rates even higher. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady called the Saturday session "a good . 
. . meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The differences between the United States and West Germany were more subtle. 
Although Bonn supported the U.S. position from the start, some officials said 
it was decidedly less firm about it. The yen has dropped a full 30% against the 
deutschemark, hurting West German trade with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure of the Group of Seven to be more forceful, Japanese 
officials hailed Saturday's communique as likely to be sufficient to restore 
confidence in the Japanese financial markets. So far this year, the yen's value 
has plunged 11%, the Japanese stock market has fallen a hefty 27% and the bond 
market has collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Makoto Utsumi, Japan's vice minister of finance for international affairs, told 
The Times after the meeting that the statement was important because it marked 
"the first time" that the Group of Seven had "singled out" the yen. He said a 
phrase pledging to keep the matter under review "is very strong." 
</P>
<P>
But officials conceded privately that it was not immediately clear whether the 
financial markets, which will open again on Monday, will be persuaded by the 
Group of Seven statement. U.S. officials declined to elaborate on the 
statement, insisting that it should "speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
The action Saturday followed a daylong discussion by the ministers that ranged 
from a review of the global economy to the impact of the coming reunification 
of East and West Germany and the creation of a new European development bank to 
make loans to the emerging East European democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Although the economies of several of the countries -- including the United 
States -- have slowed markedly in recent months, the ministers said the easing 
is a boon because there no longer is a danger that these economies might 
overheat. 
</P>
<P>
But they warned that the effort to reduce the outsized global trade imbalances 
is proceeding "unevenly." And they recommended that countries such as the 
United States, which have large trade deficits, do more to increase their 
saving, while so-called "surplus" countries move to increase spending. 
</P>
<P>
In a bow to West Germany, the ministers also sought to reassure their 
constituents that the proposed reunification of Germany -- and the monetary 
union that is expected to accompany it -- would "contribute to improved global 
growth" and the narrowing of several imbalances on the trade front.

An ancient Malaysian folk belief had it that drinking coconut water weakened 
the libido. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Malaysia's supply of coconuts far outstripped demand, forcing the 
government to fork out more than $5 million each year in production subsidies 
as Malaysian men, young and old, anxious to preserve their virility, shunned 
the drink. 
</P>
<P>
Until, that is, the arrival of Agriculture Minister Sanusi Junid, politician, 
linguist, drinker of coconut water -- and father of seven. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his maverick ideas, Malaysia's high priest of unorthodoxy hit on a 
scheme that became so successful that not only were the subsidies withdrawn, 
but demand rose so quickly that coconuts have now become costly. 
</P>
<P>
First he staged an international coconut tree climbing contest in 1987 to 
glamorize coconut-picking. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed everyone it was not just a monkey's job," the bespectacled and 
balding former banker, who speaks four languages, explained in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Then he brought along on his promotion trips to villages a coconut water 
drinker "well over a hundred years old and great-grandfather many times over" 
who helped persuade many younger men that their virility would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really just trying to be practical and try to do everything step by step. 
I believe that whatever you do, you should do your best," Sanusi said. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the Agriculture Ministry in 1986, he has carried that maxim 
to hilarious limits sometimes, hatching schemes that have drawn both laughter 
and skepticism from other Cabinet ministers and Malaysians at large. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, Sanusi almost always has had the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"I make most of my decisions based on banking strategy," he said, adding that 
he wanted to see wealth from the resource-rich, predominantly Muslim country of 
17 million trickling down to rural Malaysians, some of whom still live below 
the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the fish population off Malaysia's coast was falling, he 
embarked on a nationwide campaign to collect more than a million used car tires 
that were tied together to make artificial reefs to attract fish. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 such rubber reefs have been built, helping to reduce sharply 
Malaysia's fish imports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanusi is also persuading farmers to try out "double-decker" rice fields in 
which the crop is planted on the ground and in suspended concrete basins. 
</P>
<P>
He has started cooking classes to introduce international cuisine to village 
women, bringing them by busloads to Kuala Lumpur, the capital, where they are 
taught in two weeks how to whip up Hungarian goulash and spaghetti Bolognese. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should Malaysians be trapped by a curry culture," Sanusi asks. "When these 
people return to their kampongs (villages) after the courses they become the 
envy of their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
With the eyebrows of his skeptics still raised, Sanusi recently announced his 
latest brainstorm -- an "Eat Rabbit Meat Campaign." 
</P>
<P>
He has gone on television promotions stir-frying rabbit meat, eating barbecued 
rabbit and doffing rabbit-fur hats to achieve his vision of turning Malaysia 
into a major world exporter of rabbit meat and products. 
</P>
<P>
"I was undergoing an operation for my heart problem in San Francisco when I 
read that rabbits were one of the cleanest animals, totally vegetarian (in 
their diet) and had less cholesterol than chickens," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be eaten by all races, unlike pork and beef which is forbidden by 
Muslims and Hindus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rabbits should be (raised) in schools for food. If schoolchildren get used to 
eating rabbit meat, it can become a national dish," Sanusi added. 
</P>
<P>
Sanusi, who is fluent in his native Malay, English, German and Tamil, chose a 
career in banking but was drawn quickly to politics, becoming a member of 
Parliament at the age of 31 and junior government minister three years later 
before going on to hold two full ministerial posts.

POINDEXTER TO PAY FOR ROLE BUT REAGAN MAY SUFFER MOST; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: THE EX-WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL ONCE SAID DEFIANTLY: 'THE BUCK STOPS 
HERE WITH ME.' IT IS A STATEMENT HE LATER CAME TO REGRET.

<TEXT>
<P>
When members of Congress wanted to know two years ago who was primarily 
responsible for the Iran-Contra affair, former National Security Adviser John 
M. Poindexter told them defiantly: "The buck stops here with me." 
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision," Poindexter testified to the Iran-Contra committees. "I 
had the authority to do it. I thought it was a good idea. I was convinced that 
the President would in the end think it was a good idea, but I did not want him 
to be associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
It was a statement the former presidential adviser would later come to regret. 
During his five-week trial on charges of conspiracy, lying and obstructing 
Congress, his lawyer, Richard W. Beckler, tried without success to portray 
Poindexter instead as a man who was only carrying out the wishes of President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But with his conviction Saturday on all counts, bringing down the curtain on 
the Iran-Contra prosecution of Reagan's former aides, it appears that history 
is likely to support Poindexter's original judgment of his involvement in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
It almost certainly will be Poindexter -- not Reagan or Poindexter's gung-ho 
aide, Oliver L. North -- who suffers the most severe punishment for playing a 
central role in the scandal that scarred the Reagan presidency and nearly 
brought on a constitutional crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight men who have been tried or pleaded guilty in connection with the 
Iran-Contra affair, only Poindexter risks a jail term. North, who was convicted 
last year of only three counts, was fined $150,000 and sentenced to 1,200 hours 
of community service. And Robert C. McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessor at the 
White House, paid a $20,000 fine and served 200 hours of community service 
after pleading guilty to four counts in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview shortly after the verdict, Mark A. Belnick, former counsel for 
the Senate Iran-Contra investigation, said it was not surprising that 
Poindexter had been singled out by the American legal system to bear most of 
the responsibility for the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
"Next to the President, Poindexter was at the apex of the Administration," 
Belnick noted. "He had a heavy job; he bears a heavy responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
But Belnick and others involved in unraveling the complex Iran-Contra case were 
quick to note that while the former national security adviser will undoubtely 
suffer more in the short run, the long-term consequences of the scandal clearly 
will be felt by the man that Poindexter was trying to protect: Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran-Contra has diminished Ronald Reagan in the public's mind and in history," 
said John W. Nields Jr., who served as chief counsel for the House Iran-Contra 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The role of "fall guy" -- as North once described it -- was clearly one that 
Poindexter freely embraced on Nov. 25, 1986, when a stunned nation first 
learned that its President had authorized a covert sale of weapons to Iran and 
that top White House officials had secretly diverted $3.5 million of the 
profits from the sale to provide assistance to Contras in Nicaragua. At the 
time, the Administration was prohibited by Congress from using U.S. funds to 
aid the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
What surprised many Americans about the Iran-Contra affair was not so much that 
the President had been secretly assisting the Contras, whom he always had 
supported, but that he was involved in what appeared to be an arms-for-hostages 
swap with Iran. Since the beginning of his presidency, Reagan had pledged never 
to bargain with terrorists or hostage-takers. 
</P>
<P>
In his congressional testimony, Poindexter admitted that he had personally 
destroyed an official document signed on Jan. 17, 1986, by Reagan authorizing 
the Iran arms sale. He said he did so because it stated that the Administration 
was involved in trading arms for hostages, which Reagan had strongly denied. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter also admitted that he personally had approved the diversion of 
profits from the Iran arms sales in February, 1986, as a way of providing 
"bridge financing" for the Contras. He said that he never told Reagan about his 
action because he knew it could damage the President if it ever became public 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a very deliberate decision not to ask the President so that I could 
insulate him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the 
President if it ever leaked out," he told congressional investigators. "Of 
course, our hope was that it would not leak out." 
</P>
<P>
Although public knowledge of the diversion did not hurt Reagan's popularity as 
much as Poindexter had feared, it caused a firestorm in the Democrat-controlled 
Congress. Congressional leaders accused Reagan of violating not only the Boland 
Amendment, which banned U.S. aid to the Contras, but also the constitutional 
trust he held as President to keep Congress informed of major foreign policy 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was not the violation of the Boland Amendment or the alleged 
betrayal of the Constitution that ultimately caused Poindexter and other Reagan 
aides to run afoul of the law. All were charged with much smaller crimes, 
mostly conspiracy and lying to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Watergate scandal, which sent a number of high-level White House 
aides to jail, the Iran-Contra affair did not hinge on allegations that could 
easily be prosecuted by the criminal justice system. There are no criminal 
penalties for violating the Boland Amendment and no sanctions written into the 
Constitution -- short of impeachment -- for a President who betrays his duty to 
keep in touch with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"At its core," said Nields, the former House counsel, "Iran-Contra was a 
political matter more than a criminal matter. The criminal trials were not a 
central part of the event. Watergate was at its heart and center a criminal law 
issue. There was some criminal conduct around the edges of Iran-Contra, but 
mostly the acts committed were wrongs against our political system." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Iran-Contra prosecutors were hampered somewhat by the need to 
protect government secrets that might have been disclosed had the Reagan aides 
been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Some charges were dropped in 
order to preserve classified information that the Administration sought to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the prosecution of Reagan's aides revealed no substantial, new 
information about the Iran-Contra scandal, it provided the American people with 
an opportunity to see that the former President still refused to acknowledge 
accepted facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
In eight hours of videotaped interviews played during Poindexter's trial, 
Reagan said he still doubted that $3.5 million actually was diverted to the 
Contras -- a remark that will undoubtedly be seen as important when historians 
begin writing their accounts of the Reagan presidency and the Iran-Contra 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to be blind," said Nields. "He didn't see what he didn't want to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Contra committees concluded in November, 1987, that while Reagan knew 
nothing of the diversion, he was responsible for creating an atmosphere at the 
White House that encouraged his aides to lie to Congress and to take the law 
into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's videotaped testimony appears likely to rank as one of the most 
memorable events in the entire Iran-Contra affair, along with North's testimony 
before the congressional committees in June, 1987. With his big, gap-toothed 
grin, and rows of medals pinned to the chest of his Marine uniform, North 
became an instant media hero. 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional scholars cringed as North, with no apologies, recounted every 
detail of how he set out to create "the enterprise" -- a quasi-governmental, 
covert operation funded with Iranian arms sale profits that would carry out the 
foreign policy objectives of the President without accountability to Congress. 
It was, he asserted, the President's prerogative to conduct business in that 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
Although North's attitude quickly divided the nation -- pitting conservatives 
against liberals, Congress against the President, Democrats against Republicans 
-- Iran-Contra experts note that many of those old wounds have since healed, 
especially since the start of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried that it would polarize us," Nields said. "But there is now 
actually a better sense of cooperation between the Congress and the executive 
(branch), perhaps as a result of the Iran-Contra experience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA DEFENDANTS 
</P>
<P>
John Poindexter is one of nine people who have been indicted by special 
Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh. Here are summaries of the other eight 
and their current status: 
</P>
<P>
OLIVER L. NORTH 
</P>
<P>
A retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former aide to Poindexter, North was 
found guilty by a jury on May 4, 1989, of three felonies: altering and 
destroying official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity (a $13,800 home 
security system) and aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. He was 
sentenced last July 5 to two years' probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to 
perform 1,200 hours of community service in a District of Columbia drug 
education program for youths. He is appealing the conviction while carrying out 
the community service. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT C. McFARLANE 
</P>
<P>
The White House national security adviser who preceded Poindexter, McFarlane 
pleaded guilty on March 11, 1988, to four misdemeanor charges of withholding 
information from Congress. He was sentenced on March 3, 1989, to two years' 
probation, fined $20,000 and required to perform 200 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
CARL R. (SPITZ) CHANNELL 
</P>
<P>
A political consultant who raised money for the Contras from wealthy Americans, 
Channell pleaded guilty on April 29, 1987, to conspiring to defraud the United 
States of income tax revenue. He was sentenced last July 7 to two years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD R. MILLER 
</P>
<P>
An associate of Channell, Miller pleaded guilty on May 6, 1987, to conspiring 
to defraud the United States of tax revenue. He was sentenced last July 6 to 
two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD V. SECORD 
</P>
<P>
A retired Air Force major general and North's chief assistant for logistics, 
Secord pleaded guilty on Nov. 8, 1989, to a felony charge of making false 
statements to a congressional committee. He was sentenced on Jan. 24 to two 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
ALBERT V. HAKIM 
</P>
<P>
The businessman who controlled the money in the scandal, Hakim pleaded guilty 
to a misdemeanor charge of helping to supplement North's government salary by 
arranging to pay for a security system at North's home. He was sentenced to two 
years' probation and fined $5,000. Hakim also agreed to abandon his claim to 
$7.3 million from Iranian arms sales proceeds frozen in Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
JOSEPH F. FERNANDEZ 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., last Nov. 24 dismissed all four counts 
against Fernandez, a former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, after Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh blocked disclosure of classified information that was ruled 
relevant to Fernandez's defense. Independent counsel Walsh has appealed the 
action to the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS G. CLINES 
</P>
<P>
A former CIA agent who assisted North in locating sources of arms and shipping 
them to the Contras, Clines is awaiting trial on a four-count income tax 
indictment. Clines has pleaded innocent to allegations that he under-reported 
his earnings in 1985 and 1986 and that he falsely stated he had no foreign bank 
accounts. Upon conviction, he would face a maximum penalty of 26 years in 
prison and fines of $1.2 million.

WIDOW'S LOAN NIGHTMARE SPARKS REVIEW

The head of a giant lending company says he is taking steps to guard against 
cases like the one in which his company tried to seize the home of an elderly, 
impoverished widow. 
</P>
<P>
Other loan files from Transamerica Financial Services' Scottsdale, Ariz., 
office will be reviewed, but any problems are likely to be local, said Arthur 
van Leuven, chief executive officer of Transamerica Financial Group and 
executive vice president of its parent, Transamerica Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of court testimony by a former loan officer persuaded Transamerica 
to drop its fight with 77-year-old Lennie Williams, Van Leuven said in a recent 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The battle began after Williams allowed her small, 42-year-old home to be used 
as security for a loan her son-in-law took out from Transamerica Financial 
Services Inc., the corporation's Arizona operation. 
</P>
<P>
The son-in-law disappeared with the money, according to court records, and 
Transamerica began foreclosure on the home after Williams, who supports herself 
on pensions of $438 a month, was unable to keep up with monthly loan payments 
of $499 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer lawyers fought back. The loan officer who handled Williams' loan 
testified that he doubted whether she understood what she was doing, and a 
doctor who was treating her at the time testified that she wasn't capable of 
remembering which pill to take, much less of understanding loan agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Even after a Maricopa County Superior Court judge in January ordered a 
temporary halt to the foreclosure and said it was likely Transamerica "knew or 
should have known" something was wrong when it made the loan, the company's 
lawyers pursued the case and demanded that Williams post bond of $450 a month 
pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, an Associated Press story detailed Williams' plight. At about the 
same time, senior officials at Transamerica Financial Group received a 
transcript of the loan officer's testimony, according to Van Leuven. 
</P>
<P>
"It became apparent from that transcript that two parties had been victimized," 
he said. "Lennie Williams is one of them, and Transamerica is the other." 
</P>
<P>
The company decided to drop all proceedings against Williams and proceed only 
against the son-in-law because it is "far easier for us to stand the 
victimization than for Lennie Williams," Van Leuven said. 
</P>
<P>
The company will return payments Williams made to the court and will review 
other loans by its Scottsdale office to ensure that there aren't any similar 
cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The review will be difficult because there was nothing in Williams' file to 
indicate an unusual transaction until her lawyers began complaining, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' attorney, Michael Curran, said a tentative agreement had been reached 
in her case.

4TH BODY FOUND IN HOTEL FIRE; SEARCH FOR OTHERS CONTINUING 
</P>

<P>
A fourth body was found Saturday as authorities continued a top-to-bottom 
search of the wreckage of a hotel that was swept by fire as residents slept. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen tenants were still unaccounted for in the fire that hit the Fontana 
Hotel before dawn Friday. However, the four bodies found have not been 
identified, so they could be among the 14 missing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there are more victims inside," police Capt. Rocco DeLeo said. 
"What we are doing is getting details from relatives of people who, we believe, 
are missing and getting the physical characteristics of these persons." 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 102 rooms were rented out, but no one is sure exactly how 
many people were in the hotel at the time of the fire, said Olimpia Mihai, one 
of the Fontana's owner-managers. Estimates of the number of inhabitants have 
ranged up to 150; the registration records were burned in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
As federal, state and city teams launched a search, a crane was brought in to 
help pick apart the ruins of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
With the cause of the fire still a mystery, U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson 
issued a search warrant at the request of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms to preserve any evidence that might be needed later. The bureau 
conducts arson investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Alex Daoud said fire officials told him Friday that arson was strongly 
suspected, but Fire Chief Branaird Dorris said tenants had mentioned a water 
leak, which raised the possibility of an electrical short. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen, who donned a hard hat to inspect the three-story 
hotel, said the purpose of the warrant was to legally preserve any possible 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when the death toll would be known, Robert Creighton, ATF agent in charge 
of the Florida office, said: "We may have that in two days. It all depends on 
what we find."

<P>
Far beneath the general store and the gas station in this little Midwestern 
town lies a water wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
Scuba diving, a sport usually associated with the tropics, has come to 
Missouri. And the "Billion Gallon Lake Resort," converted from a long-abandoned 
lead mine, may be its most unusual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like diving through a ghost town, or a shipwreck," says scuba instructor 
Doug Goergens, who along with his wife, Cathy, owns the flooded mine, now 
billed as the largest freshwater dive resort in the world. "Or like soaring 
through a cathedral. It's an awe-inspiring experience." 
</P>
<P>
Goergens' superlatives can be discounted to a certain extent, since he has a 
vested interest. He says he has invested about $1 million in the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacques Cousteau's son, Jean Michel, was impressed. The son of the man 
credited as being one of the inventors of scuba (Self-Contained Underwater 
Breathing Apparatus) in the 1940s, gave the resort rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
And Skin Diver magazine has touted the mine as "a time capsule, an engineering 
marvel, and an unbeatable weekend getaway." 
</P>
<P>
Bonne Terre, or "good earth" in French, is a town of about 3,500 people about 
60 miles south of St. Louis. Last year the mine tapped into the landlocked 
Midwestern scuba market for relatively low-cost, weekend-only forays, 
attracting 15,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
The lake was formed when the owners of St. Joseph Mining Co., once the provider 
of jobs to 5,000, closed operations and shut off the water pumps. Natural 
seepage of spring and rainwater flooded the mine. 
</P>
<P>
Marian Rivman, a spokeswoman for the Diving Equipment Manufacturers Assn., an 
organization that monitors the industry, says Bonne Terre is unique. 
</P>
<P>
"People are diving everywhere," says Rivman, known in the industry as the 
"Scuba Lady." "But inland, there's nothing comparable to the mine. It's a great 
destination." 
</P>
<P>
Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. And the avid scuba fan has 
other attractions to explore in the United States, among them shipwrecks off 
the coast of North Carolina, oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or the kelp forests 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Keys are perhaps the prime U.S. destination for the estimated 2.65 
million active scuba divers in the United States, offering warm water, coral 
and fish. Divers also can investigate lakes, quarries and rivers, although 
visibility often is severely limited. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case at Lake Norfork, Ark., a 500-mile round trip from St. Louis 
where Goergens used to take his scuba students. 
</P>
<P>
"Diving can be very, very inconvenient," Goergens says. 
</P>
<P>
He's put a lot of work into removing that negative aspect at the Bonne Terre 
operation, illuminating the mine with 300,000 watts of lighting and installing 
showers and locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The mine, once the world's largest producer of lead, has the craggy look of a 
lunar landscape. Jackhammers silent since the mine closed in 1961 jut out of 
solid rock. Scattered picks, shovels, ladders and helmets also were left 
behind, and their presence adds to the surreal surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The lake is pale blue and crystal clear, with visibility more than 100 feet in 
lighting conditions Goergens describes as "late afternoon," although it appears 
to be closer to dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other diving environs, the subterranean lake is devoid of life forms -- 
no sharks to worry about here -- and other distractions such as current, surges 
or tidal rushes. A constant water temperature of 58 degrees, a little chilly 
but bearable in a wet suit, makes it a year-round resort. 
</P>
<P>
When Goergens first dived in the mine in 1974 he described it as a "dark, scary 
place." He saw potential, though, as a training ground for the 1,200 to 1,500 
students his St. Louis company, West End Diving Centers, certifies annually. 
</P>
<P>
It has turned out to be much more. To accommodate the divers that now flock to 
Bonne Terre, the Goergenses renovated a mansion once owned by the president of 
the mine and turned it into a country inn.

HIS 'WEIRD' INVENTION CLEANS UP WATER

Nature's way of recycling water gets some wet and wild twists in machines Bill 
Williamson builds to clean up hazardous wastes for industries ranging from 
nuclear power to perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole new science that we've got to learn," said Williamson, 74, who 
has been experimenting with evaporation and condensation since World War II, 
when he developed machines that distilled seawater aboard warships. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, a mechanical engineer, turned his attention to fighting pollution 
14 years ago when he and his sons, Bruce and Rod, founded the small but 
fast-growing Licon Inc. in Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing some weird things. Some smart physical chemists, when they see 
what we are doing, they just throw up their hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Licon produces evaporators that clean up waste water and let industries 
concentrate and reuse toxic metals and chemicals that once went down the drain 
into the environment. Some plants that use the machines don't even have sewers. 
</P>
<P>
The evaporators, with a patented heat exchanger, operate at relatively low 
temperatures, high efficiency and low cost, said Rod Williamson. They can treat 
waste water for 1 or 2 cents a gallon compared to as much as 12 cents for other 
machines and up to $2 for disposal in a hazardous waste dump, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One is being tested at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant; NuPac Services 
plans to use it to decontaminate 2.3-million gallons of water irradiated in the 
1979 accident that shut down the Harrisburg, Pa., plant. 
</P>
<P>
Licon evaporators, which cost $14,000 to $250,000, are in use in the United 
States, Canada and Europe. Most are in metal plating plants, although one is 
cleaning up shampoo wastes at an Alberto Culver plant in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Customers can be found in nearly any industry that produces liquid hazardous 
waste, but there are limits, Rod Williamson said. Some industries, including 
paper mills and chemical factories, produce too much waste water to be 
efficiently treated with evaporators now being produced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Williamson, who holds 30 patents, said the key to the machines is low air 
pressure. When boiled, even fresh water leaves a scale, although the residue is 
much worse with salt water or waste water and would quickly foul and corrode a 
conventional evaporator. He said he discovered that heating water in a whole or 
partial vacuum, thereby lowering its boiling point, would reduce the scale and 
permit recovering specific salts for reuse. The machines also reuse heat the 
way a heat pump improves a home heating and air conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Williamson began working on desalination while employed by Maxim Silencer 
Corp., which specialized in equipment to muffle diesel engines. It was asked to 
develop a way to purify salt water aboard Coast Guard cutters so that they 
could escort convoys in World War II. The cutters were too small to carry 
enough fuel and water to cross the ocean, but could make the trip if water 
storage areas were used instead for fuel oil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company rented a beachfront house at Clinton, Conn., to test the machine. 
Its resemblance to a moonshiner's still prompted neighbors to call the police. 
At first, officers who raided the place didn't believe the machine was 
producing nothing stronger than water but, "They looked at it and tasted it and 
said 'OK,' " Bill Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
He later worked on similar equipment for nuclear submarines and in 1970 helped 
set up a desalting test station near the Florida Panhandle resort town of 
Destin for Mechanical Equipment Co. of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson and his sons then formed Licon, short for "liquid conditioning" or 
"liquid concentration," and built its first evaporator in his garage out of 
pipe fittings and other parts they bought or made.

DISMANTLING OF IRON CURTAIN SETS STAGE FOR AN OVERHAUL IN AUSTRIA; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN POLICY: VIENNA TAKES ITS ROLE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
SERIOUSLY. BUT A TOP PRIORITY IS NOT TO BE SHUT OUT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY 
AFTER 1992.

<P>
The collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe is stirring hopes and fears in 
Austria, which for nearly 40 years has seen itself as a neutral bridge between 
East and West. 
</P>
<P>
The hope for new economic and cultural opportunities as the artificial postwar 
barriers dissolve is tempered by fears among Austrians of an unmanageable 
influx from their eastern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The government is also weighing how the reshaping of the Continent's economic 
map will affect its own top foreign policy objective -- steering Austria into 
the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Franz Vranitsky reflected the optimistic school of thought in an 
ebullient New Year message to his 7.5 million countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
"In one stroke, the expression 'country in the heart of Europe' does not just 
have a geographic sense but gains a political, economic and cultural 
dimension," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
However, he rejected the idea that Austria might be some form of political 
hermaphrodite. 
</P>
<P>
"It is often said Austria lies politically between East and West. That is 
false. In a political sense Austria belongs to the West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Economically it does, too, with trade dominated by exchanges with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although Vienna and the Czech city of Bratislava were once linked by a tram 
line, the Austrian capital has become effectively the terminus of West European 
rail and road links. 
</P>
<P>
Austria is the only country from which Soviet troops actually withdrew after 
World War II and, unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, it has 
maintained its multiparty democracy, free press and largely private economy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the government applied to join the European Community, which it 
considers vital if it is not to be shut out of the single European Community 
market after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But, reflecting a line in the national anthem that the country is "like a 
strong heart at the center of the region," it has taken its pivotal role 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Austria is the host for several East-West security conferences, a United 
Nations headquarters and other institutions and it is arranging -- with Hungary 
-- a World Exhibition in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Michael Lingens, publisher of the weekly magazine Wochenpresse, spoke of 
a potential for Viennese culture to recapture the glories of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, when it drew inspiration from Prague and Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
The end of Communist control and opening up of borders across the region "offer 
us the greatest opportunities since the collapse of the monarchy (in 1918)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not because, as some people may imagine, we could again become the center of a 
great world empire but because Austria could re-emerge as a cultural power in 
the world," once again drawing on its diverse roots across the region. 
</P>
<P>
While political commentators waxed lyrical about the chances for the Alpine 
state, the response within the overwhelmingly bourgeois society, which has 
grown rich while its Communist neighbors languished, has been ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
As tens of thousands of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles and East Germans 
took advantage of new freedoms to take a peek inside the well-stocked stores of 
Vienna's consumer society, many in the capital became defensive and possessive. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll showed that 63% of Viennese found the peaceful invasion across 
the dismantled Iron Curtain unwelcome and only 22% said they felt good about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Warm-hearted gestures to offer free transportation and theater tickets to their 
less well-off Eastern visitors drew angry protests from some Viennese, who 
complained of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that we don't exactly have a great sensitivity for historic 
moments," said public opinion researcher Rudolf Bretschneider. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Vienna telephone directory is dominated by non-German names and 
many of the city's 1.5 million people are themselves refugees from Communist 
countries, resentment toward foreigners from the East is always near the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
A Polish woman in her 30s who has lived in Vienna for more than four years was 
told sharply by a native Viennese during a dispute over a parking place: "Go 
back to your homeland." 
</P>
<P>
A special Cabinet session on the anti-Communist revolution at Austria's 
northern, southern and eastern borders confirmed that the country should retain 
its role as a transit and asylum country but tighten its checks on illegal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Many politicians, including Vranitsky, believe that Austria, with its stability 
and economic success, could be taken as a model by the East Bloc states as they 
rebuild their economies. 
</P>
<P>
"We, too, had to start from nothing (after World War II), and today we receive 
general recognition and respect for our neutrality, our political freedom, our 
economic success and our social security system," the chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
Other commentators, such as veteran conservative politician Erhard Busek, who 
has long cultivated central European links, was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Although Busek saw an opportunity for Austria to assert itself as a key player 
in the heart of Europe, he warned of the danger of the German-speaking country 
being viewed as "a third German state" or an historic part of the German 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
He also referred to half-joking assessments that Austria, much of whose heavy 
industry and banking is at least part state-owned, could itself become "the 
last East Bloc country" if it did not bring in economic and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned specifically the immense social and economic power of the two big 
political parties -- the Socialists and the conservative People's Party -- and 
the monopoly of the state broadcasting system.

A Canadian who won a new trial on his conviction for trying to export metals 
used in nuclear weapons to Pakistan in 1986 pleaded guilty to lesser charges 
rather than face another trial. 
</P>
<P>
Arshad Z. Pervez was released after being sentenced in the new case to 32 
months in prison, time he has already served, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Kurland said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pervez pleaded guilty Wednesday to attempting to export beryllium, a material 
crucial to nuclear weapons production. In return, prosecutors dropped charges 
of conspiracy and making false statements to the government, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pervez, a native of Pakistan who became a Canadian citizen, was to be arraigned 
Wednesday on a new indictment but surprised prosecutors with his plea, Kurland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kurland said Pervez contacted Carpenter Technology Corp. in late 1986 to ask 
about purchasing a high-strength nickel-iron alloy that is used to build 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A Carpenter official who knew that the import of the metal to Pakistan was 
restricted contacted the government.

The pistol Teddy Roosevelt carried in his charge up San Juan Hill has been 
stolen, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The .45-caliber Colt revolver was discovered missing from Sagamore Hill, the 
Long Island home of the nation's 26th President, now a museum. Chief Ranger Ray 
Bloomer, who is blind, found Saturday that the exhibit case that contained the 
gun was loose. 
</P>
<P>
The pistol, now valued at $500,000, was given to Roosevelt after its recovery 
from the battleship Maine, whose sinking in Havana Harbor in 1898 led to the 
U.S. declaration of war against Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The gun's blued barrel is inscribed: "July 1, 1898, San Juan, carried and used 
by Col. Theodore Roosevelt," and "From the sunken battleship MAINE."

sparking no major problems, authorities reported Saturday. Local police, 
supported by 60 officers on loan from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department 
and the California Highway Patrol, had made 139 arrests and issued 700

NOISE POLLUTION STANDARDS QUIETLY FADE AWAY

<P>
The infernal racket of urban life can drive you crazy, but there's only one 
person left at the Environmental Protection Agency who can hear your complaints 
above the din. 
</P>
<P>
EPA scientist Kenneth E. Feith is the guy who picks up the phone and listens to 
laments about noisy trucks and trash compactors, shrieking jet planes and the 
banshee howl of the neighbor's lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
Feith, 58, says he is the "institutional memory" of the EPA's Office of Noise 
Abatement and Control, which once boasted a $10-million budget and more than 
100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The office went out of business in 1982, the victim of President Ronald 
Reagan's budget-cutting deregulation campaign. It now ranks as a "non-program" 
without budget or staff. 
</P>
<P>
Feith, who once wrote the EPA's anti-noise regulations, has other duties today, 
but he answers a couple of dozen phone calls about noise pollution every week 
as a courtesy to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this almost out of my hip pocket," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The noise, meanwhile, hasn't gone away. If anything, it's getting worse. 
Experts estimate that more than 20 million Americans are exposed daily to noise 
loud enough to cause permanent loss of hearing during a working lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
That level is above 80 decibels, about the intensity of noise produced by a 
vacuum cleaner or electrical tools. 
</P>
<P>
Studies also show that the stress of loud, sustained noise can cause high blood 
pressure, ulcers, headaches, insomnia, respiratory ailments, learning 
difficulties among children, job absenteeism, anxiety, irritability and 
anti-social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
If the bells of Notre Dame drove poor Quasimodo nearly mad, the decibels are 
still giving us fits. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
* A 69-year-old man living in a trailer home under a noisy airport flight path 
was arrested recently in Llano, Calif., after he allegedly took a 4-foot mirror 
outside and tried to blind pilots with reflected sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
* An angry Bavarian mounted a catapult in his front yard and launched his 
wife's homemade dumplings at low-flying jet fighters from a nearby military 
base. 
</P>
<P>
* A Japanese apartment dweller, distraught that a young girl ignored his 
repeated complaints about her loud piano playing, went next door and stabbed 
the girl, her sister and her mother. 
</P>
<P>
A woman was taken into custody in New York City for allegedly aiming a 
double-barreled shotgun at a maintenance worker outside her window, complaining 
that he was disturbing her and her pets. 
</P>
<P>
The aggravation may get worse before it gets better, says Dr. Alice H. Suter, a 
research audiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health and a leading expert on noise pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that it's somewhat noisier than it used to be," she said in a 
telephone interview from her office in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"The newly manufactured jet planes and heavy trucks are quieter, but the 
overall amount of noise is greater just because there's more of everything -- 
construction, planes, traffic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Suter said lack of money has prevented accurate measurement of increased noise 
levels. The demise of the EPA's noise office also meant that the pipeline of 
federal money for research and technical assistance to states and localities 
dried up. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, only 15 state and local anti-noise programs are still active, 
compared to 1,100 in the mid-1970s when noise pollution was a popular 
environmental cause. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's anti-noise regulations remain in effect for trains, heavy trucks, 
railroad coupling and switching equipment, air compressors, motorcycles and 
labeling of earplugs, but there's virtually no one to enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite improved truck exhaust mufflers and highway sound barriers, 
vehicular traffic still ranks as the worst offender. Another source of 
potentially damaging noise is the typical American home with its leaf blowers, 
mowers, power tools, food blenders, dishwashers and laundry machines, Feith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The experts say noise pollution is easily ignored in an industrial society 
concerned with oil spills, garbage, smog and other more visible forms of 
pollution, but they say it is no less hazardous to health. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been a Greenpeace or a Sierra Club for noise," Feith said. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't get as excited about noise as they do about cancer-causing agents 
in the environment. Noise doesn't leave bodies in the streets. But it can cause 
physical, emotional and psychological effects that are just as debilitating."

KAISER UNION VOTES MONDAY ON CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Striking Kaiser Permanente workers returned to the picket lines Saturday 
pending a ratification vote on a new contract offer from the nation's largest 
and oldest health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from the union for the 11,000 workers who walked out Monday said 
that union negotiators agreed Friday to let the membership vote on the proposed 
three-year deal because it included improvements in salary in the second and 
third years, "longevity compensation" for longtime employees, and a guarantee 
that workers could use a floating holiday for Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser and Local 399 of the Hospital and Service Employees International Union 
announced late Friday that the offer would be presented to the rank-and-file 
for a vote Monday. If approved, the agreement would end the strike immediately 
after the vote, union officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The union, however, said it intended to present the offer without a 
recommendation, leaving it unclear whether union leaders support the proposed 
pact. 
</P>
<P>
The membership rejected the last Kaiser offer March 30 despite the union's 
recommendation that it be accepted. That $44 million proposal called for salary 
increases of 5% to 6% in the first year and 3% to 5% in the second and third 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Employees contend they have had no meaningful wage increases since the early 
1980s, when the number of companies belonging to Kaiser's medical plan began to 
decrease and employees were told they would have to live with small or no wage 
increases until the hospitals regained a stable membership. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer emerged after three days of federally mediated talks between the 
union and Kaiser. According to their statement, the union agreed to put the 
pact up for a vote "at the express request" of Bernard de Lury, the national 
director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. 
</P>
<P>
The voting will be supervised by a local federal mediator. Until the vote is 
complete, picketing will continue at all Kaiser locations affected by the 
strike, union spokesman Tom Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Horwatt, a Kaiser spokeswoman, declined to detail the offer other than to 
characterize as it as "fair." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 11,200 service, clerical and technical employees at seven Kaiser 
hospitals and 45 clinics in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties walked off 
the job Monday, forcing curtailments in medical care for HMO members. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser has transferred several hundred patients from the affected hospitals to 
other Kaiser facilities and most elective surgeries were canceled or postponed. 
The number of admitted patients has dropped to an average 47% of capacity at 
the seven hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Outpatient care at the hospitals and clinics in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura 
counties has remained at 60% to 70% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and substitute workers were filling in for some of the striking 
employees and the company maintains that there have been no serious disruptions 
in medical care.

Police said Saturday that they were looking for a man who tried to rape a motel 
maid but came off second-best in the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The maid, described by acquaintances as small, bit the man's bottom lip and 
part of his goatee off, left bite marks over his upper body and scratches 
across his face, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital emergency rooms throughout Southern California have been put on alert, 
but so far the suspect has not appeared, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's fine. She wasn't hurt at all," said a fellow employee at the motel on 
Manchester Avenue. "She acted very bravely, and we're very proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
The maid, however, remains upset by the Monday morning attack and is no longer 
working alone, an employee said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the woman, 24, was working in a room about 11 a.m. when a 
man entered. Police described him as 30 to 35 years old, 5 feet, 6 inches tall 
and weighing about 160 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
He attacked her but she fought back, savaging her assailant, police said. "He 
must have thought he'd gotten in a cave with a tiger," one officer said.

TIMBUKTU, Mali 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Timbuktu was lucky last year. It rained, the locusts stayed away and, with some 
help from the outside, farmers produced one of the best harvests in half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers in nearly all the countries that hug the southern Sahara Desert's harsh 
border produced similar bumper crops that filled granaries and children's 
bellies from Senegal east to Niger. 
</P>
<P>
The good fortune of 1988 and 1989, welcome as it is, also illuminates the 
profound problems facing these poor nations struggling to feed themselves -- 
problems that range from a birthrate that outpaces production to a marketplace 
that stacks the deck against even the hardest-working farmer. 
</P>
<P>
Experts note that, even with the bountiful harvest in most countries, 
sub-Saharan Africa imported nearly 9 million tons of cereal grains in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the 500,000-ton grain surplus is spectacular news," said U.S. 
Ambassador Robert Pringle. "Now everyone is wondering how to export what they 
have grown." 
</P>
<P>
Abduleh al Kalifa, hip-deep in a field of emerald-green wheat rippling in a 
desert wind near Timbuktu, does not worry about exporting. He just wishes he 
could sell his surplus 30 miles away in Timbuktu. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago there was no rain, nothing to eat," said Kalifa, 36, already 
middle-aged in a nation where the average life expectancy is 49. "Foreigners 
gave us everything. These last two years, the harvests were good. We have hope 
and two warehouses are full. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more than we can eat, more than we can store and we can't sell the 
rest," he said. "How can we get our grain to town if there are no roads? How 
can we compete with grain from other countries? How can we earn enough money to 
buy food when there is another drought?" 
</P>
<P>
Mali's last drought left its mark on the children. Two-year-olds are solid and 
round, but children born in the drought of 1984-1985 are spindly, apt to suffer 
from chronic malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are malnourished, a few good meals will make you feel better, but you 
are still malnourished," said Leo DeVos, director of the United Nations 
Children's Fund in Mali. "The whole country is like these children. It will 
take more than a couple of good harvests to put the country back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, it's nice to see the green," he said. "It is the color of hope." 
</P>
<P>
When UNICEF arrived five years ago with emergency food, the government was in 
chaos, people were starving and huge numbers of refugees arrived in cities each 
day from the barren countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous need remained when the crisis ended, so UNICEF and others stayed on to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which spends about $30 million a year in Mali, now helps 
entrepreneurs and small farmers. West Germany built warehouses for reserves and 
a highway that spans a nation as large as Texas and California combined. 
</P>
<P>
France, Italy and others fight the advance of the desert, dig wells, organize 
cooperatives and help in dozens of other ways. 
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has concentrated on Timbuktu, a once-mysterious oasis that still evokes 
romance and adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago, Timbuktu was a crossroads of caravans, a center of learning and 
a garden in the desert, where the river ran deep and trees hung heavy with 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the advancing desert has tied a noose of dunes around it and many donors 
have written the city off as a lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
With funds donated by Italian labor unions, UNICEF installed pumps to make use 
of Niger River water and drilled wells to tap ground water for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to set an example, to show what could be done in even the most 
precarious situation," DeVos said. One result of the five-year project was the 
field where Kalifa and his neighbors grew a 15-ton grain surplus, little of 
which can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The Mali government formerly had price controls, which kept food costs down and 
made urban voters happy, but discouraged farmers because of the low return on 
their labor. Controls were abolished at the insistence of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
International donors and lenders also demanded that Mali eliminate 
protectionist measures and subsidies to farmers. Their message was simple: No 
open markets, no aid. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a long-term commitment to food aid, in return for which we ask that 
the entire cereal market be freed," said Dennis Brennan, director of the U.S. 
Agency for International Development in Bamako. 
</P>
<P>
With the market wide open, rice from Thailand and Louisiana costs less in the 
Timbuktu bazaar than grain grown down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"The little guy works like crazy to grow something, pulling grain from soil 
that is poor, in primitive conditions and in a climate that is never favorable, 
even when there is no drought," said Giovanni Fiore, director of UNICEF's 
Timbuktu project and an Africa veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when the farmer produces a surplus, there are no buyers. No one in the 
villages has any cash and consumers in Timbuktu buy whatever is cheapest. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes from Europe or the United States where farmers receive subsidies," 
Fiore said. "How can a Malian compete? He has no subsidy. All he has is taxes 
and the high cost of the pump, gasoline, oil, fertilizer, all of which has to 
be imported at double, triple, 10 times the cost to an American. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the donors tie aid to an open market in which farmers from 
developed countries can sell their surplus. So our farmers eat what they can, 
store a little, which will last a year or two, and when there is another 
extended drought, there will be famine."

LABOR: FINANCIAL COLLAPSE AND HOPE OF A BETTER DEAL FROM A NEW BUS COMPANY 
OWNER COULD BE STRATEGY IF STRIKE TAKES PATH OF THE TROUBLED AIRLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After five weeks, the Greyhound bus strike has become a war of attrition that 
may eventually resemble the Eastern Airlines strike, where workers virtually 
gave up any short-term hope of getting their jobs back and aimed instead for 
the financial destruction of their company. 
</P>
<P>
In such a scenario, Greyhound would operate indefinitely as a shrunken, 
non-union company using permanently hired replacement workers. Strikers would 
literally wait on the sidelines, hoping the company would falter, file for 
bankruptcy protection and eventually fall into the hands of a new owner who 
might cut a better deal with the union. 
</P>
<P>
When the strike by 6,000 drivers and 3,000 clerical and maintenance employees 
first began March 2, strikers were cheered by how few buses Greyhound was able 
to put on the road. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Greyhound claims to be running nearly 50% of its regular departure 
load, as opposed to about 20% during the strike's first week, strikers are 
pointing with satisfaction to a recent financial statement by Greyhound that 
acknowledged the work stoppage could be costly. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual financial report filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Greyhound said: "There is some risk that a prolonged strike would 
seriously impair the company's financial position and future operations." 
</P>
<P>
The report also said Greyhound has borrowed $25 million since the strike began, 
discussed renegotiating other loans and cut capital spending plans by 20% 
through next year. The report also said the long-term profitability of 
Greyhound's package express business has been affected. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound also has failed by a wide margin to meet its initial goal of having 
80% of its service in operation by the end of March. Only 48.7% of its routes 
were served Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, "there is no truth to the notion we are in financial trouble," a 
Greyhound spokesman said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prospect of further negotiations between Greyhound and the 
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Locals has diminished as relations between the 
strikers and the bus company deteriorated into bombastic exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Greyhound Chairman Fred Currey, alluding to a continuing string of 
sniper fire at Greyhound buses, said "no American worth his salt negotiates 
with terrorists." Edward Strait, president of the council, responded that the 
company's refusal to return to the bargaining table was "putting the 
negotiations back into the hands of terrorists." The union, contending that it 
has no control over individual acts, has accused Greyhound of using the 
shootings as an excuse to avoid negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound began last week by demanding seven days without an attack on a bus as 
a precondition of resuming negotiations. By the week's end, the company was 
saying it might drop that demand if the union took disciplinary action against 
members who had committed violence. A Greyhound spokesman said Friday that the 
company is in the process of firing 60 non-striking employees who it believes 
have committed violence. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the strike is the drivers' demand for an increase in the 
30-cents-per-mile wage. The drivers want a flat increase. Greyhound wants to 
condition an increase on company profitability. The company refuses to agree to 
a contract that would increase fares, arguing that such a move would cut 
ridership. 
</P>
<P>
Most striking drivers long ago began working other jobs and union officials 
acknowledge that even if the strike is settled, many of those who had been with 
Greyhound only a few years probably would not return. Strikers with the biggest 
stake in the outcome are older drivers hired before 1983, when pension benefits 
were far better. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cushing-Murray, the president of the Los Angeles Greyhound drivers' local 
who said he had argued against a strike, said he believes that Greyhound 
probably can no longer afford a pay raise that would satisfy strikers because 
it has lost so much money from the work stoppage. Workers had agreed to pay 
cuts of 8% and 23% in their last two contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any victory we can get out of this now," he said. "The 
only hope for the union is that Currey goes bankrupt and the union is able to 
purchase Greyhound" by using the financial leverage of employee-owned stock and 
financing from a friendly financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
The International Assn. of Machinists pursued much the same strategy after it 
went on strike against Eastern Airlines a year ago. Eastern subsequently 
sustained massive financial losses as it continued to operate and sought 
protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. The airline's creditors, 
exasperated by Eastern's mounting losses, voted last week to reject the 
airline's latest reorganization proposal and asked the court to appoint a 
special trustee to sell Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Greyhound Chairman Currey has) spent as much as we think, he doesn't have 
any more money to pay wages. He's destroyed the creditability of the company's 
package express business. He's destroyed his summer charter business. He's at 
least destroyed the business for one year," Cushing-Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Currey purchased Greyhound in 1987 when it was heavily in the red and finally 
turned a small profit of $700,000 on revenues of $1 billion last year. The 
company actually made a $49-million operating profit, but it was wiped out by 
interest payments on loans Currey assumed to purchase the company. 
</P>
<P>
In some quarters of organized labor, the Greyhound strike has been regarded as 
a no-win effort from the moment drivers walked off. Critics say the strike was 
called without sufficient preparation and that it would have been strategically 
smarter for drivers to have continued negotiating and working without a 
contract. Striking, these critics say, merely triggered what has become a 
familiar management response in American industrial relations: hiring 
replacements, continuing to operate, cutting off negotiations and, in effect, 
freezing the strikers out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a suicide mission," one labor union consultant said. "Then the 
guys are all frustrated, feeling a lot of pain, so they're sitting on the side 
of the road taking shots."

COUPLE FEAR THAT DEVELOPMENT PORTENDS PARADISE LOST

HOTCHKISS TRACT, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rhonda and A.J. Hanson found a small house on this piece of Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Delta land in 1974, they thought they had discovered paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Although the house was only a 30- to 45-minute commute from A.J.'s job as a 
high school teacher in Concord and Rhonda's court-reporting job in Walnut 
Creek, it seemed to be in another world. On one side the house faced Sandmound 
Slough, one of the many waterways that meander through the 1,100-square-mile 
delta; on the other side was open grazing land. 
</P>
<P>
On Hotchkiss Tract and adjacent Bethel Island, there are no traffic lights, gas 
stations or shopping centers -- the urban trappings that had caused the Hansons 
to flee the suburban East Bay shortly after their marriage in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the couple have turned a somewhat decrepit 800-square-foot house 
into a handsome 2,800-square-foot structure, built on pilings, as most new 
homes in the area must be to protect from flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Moored on Sandmound Slough, close to their home, is a houseboat on which the 
Hansons and their two daughters, ages 4 and 6, take leisurely summer vacation 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since the Hansons moved in, their piece of paradise has been 
threatened by developers who want to place thousands of new, mostly expensive 
homes on Bethel Island and Hotchkiss Tract. 
</P>
<P>
One developer plans to breach a levee and build 550 waterfront homes that will 
sell for $400,000 or more. Another, based in Newport Beach, would like to place 
2,000 units on what has been a 1,000-acre ranch. The owner of the grazing land 
across the road from the Hansons wants to build another 1,400 units. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Rhonda Hanson has served on many local committees formed to 
resist this kind of large-scale development. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson says she is not opposed to all development, that she and her husband are 
not "no-growthers." 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can do some things," she said recently. "I'm not going to try to 
stop all development. That's not my goal. I would just like to preserve the 
character of the place." 
</P>
<P>
Breaching levees to build expensive waterfront homes on small lots is not her 
idea of preserving the character of what has been a quiet backwater in booming 
Contra Costa County. 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda and many of her neighbors worry about the flood danger that permanently 
haunts Bethel Island and Hotchkiss Tract, both of which lie largely below sea 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's a safety issue," she said. "The more people there are, the 
less time people will have to get off" in case of a levee break. 
</P>
<P>
On Holland Tract, across Sandmound Slough from the Hanson home, there was such 
a break during the vicious winter storms of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The cows were crying and drowning," Rhonda recalls. "They wouldn't get on the 
barges" that were supposed to carry them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
But the years of meetings, reports and studies seem to be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
A "specific plan" that would allow 5,000 new dwelling units on Bethel Island 
and Hotchkiss Tract was approved by the East County Planning Commission in 
February and is being considered by the Contra Costa County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
If all the units are built, population will increase from 2,500 to more than 
17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Wandry, deputy director of the county Community Development Department, 
defended the plan, which he said will preserve Bethel Island as "pretty much a 
recreational area," while most of the new houses will be built on Hotchkiss 
Tract. 
</P>
<P>
Hotchkiss "doesn't have the same safety questions" as Bethel Island, Wandry 
said. "You have high land you can go to. Not as much of the land is below sea 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Wandry said the new developments, including the 1,400 units across the road 
from the Hansons, will provide residents with better sewer and water service, 
more recreational facilities and better police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
Wandry acknowledged that the plan would "change the character of the area 
somewhat" but added that "there's pressure for development" in the delta. "And 
if it's going to happen, this is the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said the plan reflects the fact that developers have clout with county 
planners and with the Board of Supervisors while local residents do not. 
</P>
<P>
"The supervisors light up when the developers get up, in their suede shoes, and 
talk about how wonderful all this is going to be for the community," she said. 
"When we speak, they try to ignore us as much as possible. It's frustrating but 
I keep going back because I'm a thorn in their side." 
</P>
<P>
But lately she has stopped going to most meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who oppose big development have pretty much given up," she said. 
"At the last meeting of the East County Planning Commission I broke down and 
cried. I haven't been to many meetings since." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband will wait to see what kind of housing is built across the 
road. If it is as bad as they expect it to be, she said, "we'll be gone."

Edith Stricoff once loved to dance and to travel, but now cannot even brush her 
teeth on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Bernard, cleans house, cooks, does laundry, bathes his wife and 
helps her use a commode in a corner of the living room, where a hospital bed 
contrasts with colorful Peruvian weavings from a vacation a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Stricoff, 65, said he cares for his 64-year-old wife up to 20 hours a day, on 
call even through the night, when a groan from downstairs will rouse him to see 
if she is cold or her arm is stuck under her body. For four hours a day, he has 
hired help. 
</P>
<P>
People sometimes suggest a nursing home. They say Edith Stricoff, former 
bookkeeper and mother of three, is a burden at her advanced stage of 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
But Stricoff hums old songs the couple once danced to and sometimes thinks she 
murmurs his name as he hugs her in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't throw an injured child out of the house because the child is 
injured," he said. "Why should I do that to my wife?" 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of men are caring for aging and infirm wives, parents and 
other relatives, according to a study by Lenard W. Kaye and Jeffrey S. 
Applegate, professors at the Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research 
at Bryn Mawr College in suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Men's roles as care givers have traditionally been minimized, if not virtually 
dismissed, by the professional and lay public alike," they write in their 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Although women are two-thirds to three-fourths of an estimated 7 million care 
givers nationwide, a significant number of men "have been willing to commit a 
substantial portion of their lives, both in time and effort, to this 
challenging task," the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
More men are doing so largely because women are stretched to the limit by 
careers, other family demands and the rising number of elderly, the researchers 
say. Other factors include men's changing attitudes toward family and cuts in 
governmental aid for elder care, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye said in an interview the study was intended to address the special needs 
of male care givers. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way are we trying to cancel out the dominant role -- no question it's a 
dominant role -- played by women," he said. "We just believe that they cannot 
keep up at this rate. We need to be able to turn and be willing to consider 
alternative routes to take when we talk about family care giving." 
</P>
<P>
The study is based on surveys of 152 leaders of care giver support groups and 
148 male participants in such groups across the nation. The research, supported 
by a grant from the Andrus Foundation of the American Assn. of Retired Persons, 
also included in-depth interviews with 30 male care givers and nine elderly 
recipients in the Philadelphia region and surveys of a 26-member national 
expert panel. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of eight men in the study considered themselves primary care givers, and 
more than a third were sole care providers. Only 20% said they were helped by 
more than two relatives. Four of five cared for people with Alzheimer's, the 
progressive brain disorder that causes premature senility. 
</P>
<P>
The men often continued to work while providing care and resisted joining 
support groups, preferring to "go it alone" or fearing participation would be 
an admission of failure. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the men felt most competent at such tasks as paying bills, taking 
people to doctors and helping with telephoning and letter-writing. They felt 
least competent at helping with grooming, bathing and dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The study is limited by its size and by the fact that care givers surveyed were 
primarily white, married men over age 60, living with and caring for wives, and 
relatively secure financially. Minority and low-income men tend less than 
white, middle-class men to join the support groups from which the sample was 
drawn, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
Eloise Rathbone-McCuan, professor of social welfare at the University of 
Kansas, said she had not seen any evidence of an increasing number of men 
providing elder care. But she agreed that "the demographics of women and aging 
will force men to be confronted with many new roles," especially care giving. 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Stone, a research fellow at the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, said the study could help 
draw more attention to care giving in general, which has often been viewed as a 
women's issue. "From a political perspective, since it's still primarily a 
man's world, there may be more of a serious focus on this problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye and Applegate said their results indicate that support groups should reach 
out more to men, who otherwise may end up enduring too much of the burden and 
allowing their own health to deteriorate. Advertisements for support groups 
should include more men and emphasize such practical topics as legal issues, 
finding home health care, stages of Alzheimer's disease and information on 
government benefits, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are probably going to hesitate getting involved in a group if you play up 
too strongly the emotional payoff, the benefits of sharing experiences," Kaye 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stricoff, who prided himself on being able to work things out himself as his 
wife grew more ill, resisted joining a support group sponsored by the 
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Assn. at Thomas Jefferson University 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why do I have to go to a group for? Sit there and listen to them. 
What are they going to tell me? I'm living with the damn thing. I know what it 
is,' " Stricoff said. 
</P>
<P>
But his children and other relatives kept after him. "And I went, and 
surprisingly enough, it was fulfilling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now he tries not to miss monthly meetings, because of the tips he picks up on 
ways to help his wife and the moral support. 
</P>
<P>
Stricoff said he provides most of his wife's care and does most of the 
household tasks by himself, although the couple's children, who are grown and 
live in the Philadelphia suburbs and Florida, call regularly and help on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to remember how my wife would have reacted had I been in that 
situation," he said. "I honestly feel she would probably do as much as she 
physically can for me, which is what I'm doing for my wife. I do it because of 
my love for her."

HINTS FROM HELOISE: FOR EASTER, DECORATING HOLLOW SHELLS IS BEST WAY TO AVOID 
WASTING EGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My children like to decorate Easter eggs but I hate to waste 
three or four dozen good eggs. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEANNE, Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: One of my favorite traditions here in San Antonio is cascarones 
-- decorated hollow egg shells. They're simple to make and should be just the 
thing you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever you use fresh eggs, don't crack the shells -- blow them out instead. 
This takes a little more time than just cracking them, but it's easy to do. Be 
sure the egg is clean, then poke a pin hole in the small end of the shell. 
Next, using a knife or spoon, gently crack a small dime-size circle at the 
other end and carefully remove it. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to remove the inner "skin" that lines the eggshell so that the egg can 
come out. Hold the egg over a cup or bowl and blow into the pin hole, forcing 
the egg out the broken end. 
</P>
<P>
Run water gently into the empty shell to rinse it, blow out the water and set 
it aside to dry thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
The empty shells can be dyed, painted or decorated with markers the same as 
hard-cooked eggs. Just be sure to handle them gently. Close the open end by 
pasting a small piece of colored tissue paper over it. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional cascarones are filled with confetti before the end is sealed. 
Breaking the egg and sprinkling the confetti on someone is supposed to bring 
good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Start several weeks ahead to make sure you have plenty of eggshells, knowing 
that you can have your Easter eggs and eat them too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Easter will soon be here and so will the traditional Easter-egg 
hunts. Children will be searching here and there, Easter baskets in hand, for 
those colorful Easter eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Adults should be aware that special precautions need to be taken when storing 
hard-cooked Easter eggs before and after the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-cooked eggs should be cooled and refrigerated immediately or they just may 
become a source of food poisoning. This is also true for foods containing eggs, 
like egg salad, deviled eggs and potato salad. If the Easter eggs are destined 
to become a side dish, make sure they are not left at room temperature for more 
than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
If you hide hard-cooked eggs for an Easter-egg hunt or display them in a 
centerpiece, either follow the two-hour rule or do not eat them. 
</P>
<P>
Here's to a happy and safe Easter for you and yours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: How can I get spaghetti-sauce stains out of my children's vinyl 
place mats? 
</P>
<P>
 -- CHERI, Houston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CHERI: Soak the place mats in an enzyme stain-remover bleach mixed with a 
little detergent and warm water. Follow the directions on the box for amounts. 
After soaking, scrub the spots with a brush and then rinse thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
If the stains remain, put the place mats outside on a hot, sunny day and let 
the sun bleach them out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: As a young, working homemaker I've learned to cook quick, easy 
meals for my family but I still have one problem -- planning interesting, 
well-balanced menus. I've been getting ideas, though, by looking at the frozen 
dinners in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Each dinner has a meat, a starch and one or two vegetables. I make a note of 
the different combinations, then duplicate them on my own. This helps me avoid 
repetitious meals and my family enjoys the variety. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SALLY, Rockwall, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: This may sound trivial, but my children and I would really 
appreciate some help. Is there any way to keep peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches (their favorites) from getting soggy in their lunch boxes? 
</P>
<P>
 -- PAT, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PAT: Not trivial at all to a true peanut butter and jelly lover. Spread 
peanut butter on both pieces of bread, then add the jelly. The peanut butter 
will keep the jelly from soaking through. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure other peanut butter and jelly lovers have hints too, so please share 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints 
received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF STANDARD HOSPITAL FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Probably in no time in your life does food mean less to you than when you're 
sick. You may not even feel like eating, or your sense of taste may be thrown 
off. But by the same token, people who are laid up in bed sometimes focus more 
attention than usual on meals because they have fewer outside distractions. 
And, although your appetite might be in hiding, you may need nourishment all 
the more when you're ill. 
</P>
<P>
Sound contradictory? Welcome to the looking-glass world of hospital eating, 
where it sometimes seems as if nothing goes the way you want or expect it to. 
</P>
<P>
If you've ever done a stint as an in-patient, chances are you've had occasion 
to complain about hospital food. Some of our best friends happen to be 
nutritionists and dietitians who are trying their best to provide good, 
nutritious fare for hospitalized clientele. But our heads would have to be in 
the sand not to notice that their valiant efforts don't always meet with 
success, especially in the eyes -- or taste buds -- of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main gripes we hear, of course, is that the food simply does not 
taste good. Factoring out the depressing aspect of eating alone in a hospital 
room instead of in the comfort of your home, in the bosom of your family, it's 
true that institutional food, even at its best, is hard-pressed to match the 
quality of meals made in cozier kitchens. So that rap is hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
A further drawback is that being on a special diet, in conjunction with medical 
treatment for an illness, can mean that food choices are limited. That makes 
meals still more drab and dull. About half the patients in acute-care hospitals 
need special diets for tests or therapy. Sometimes, with time and planning (not 
to mention money), restricted menus can be made interesting. But even given 
those resources, it's still a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Many people report that hospital meals are served at strange times. There's a 
reason for that: Hospital food services often operate on a two-shift system, 
with a skeleton crew on hand in the evenings. Dinner is served early to avoid 
having to pay people overtime, part of the ongoing struggle to keep a lid on 
costs. Scheduling the evening meal for a more fashionable hour -- say, 7:30 -- 
in many cases would not be economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason why dinner is served early is so that the patient's meal won't 
be interrupted if physicians and visitors come in later. Similarly, breakfasts 
are frequently served at what seems like a ridiculously early hour, to allow 
patients to be ready for their treatments later in the morning. These odd 
mealtime hours, over which you have no say, may serve to reinforce the loss of 
control many people feel when they enter a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the complaint that meals often arrive cold. Again, there is an 
explanation. For space and hygienic reasons, hospital kitchens are often 
located in isolated parts of the building. Staff try to compensate for the 
distance the meal must travel with the use of hot carts and tray insulators. 
</P>
<P>
A confusing aspect of hospital fare is that you're usually required to order 
meals a day in advance. By the time the tray appears the next day, you may have 
forgotten what it was you ordered -- and you may no longer be in the mood for 
it. This is just another inherent disadvantage of institutional food. 
</P>
<P>
However, in this age of computers, we can look forward to the day when the 
entire system will be programmed and lag time will be reduced, so that patients 
won't have to think ahead in this way. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a patient in a hospital and you find that most of the food is fine, 
well and good. But if eating has really become a problem, try to figure out 
exactly what is going on. Is it pain, depression, appetite or the food itself? 
Discuss the situation as specifically as you can with a nurse or doctor. 
Sometimes the problem turns out to be related to the illness. 
</P>
<P>
Another step is to ask to speak to the nutritionist or dietitian. The hospital 
team is committed to providing patients with food that is not only 
nutritionally sound but that they will enjoy eating. With the doctor's 
approval, a diet might be altered to make it more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Proper nutrition is important in recovering from illness. So make your feelings 
known -- and give the staff a chance to try to meet your needs.

THE BUTCHER: USDA PROVIDES DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES FOR CURING, DRYING, COOKING 
MEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR BUTCHER: Your recipe for beef jerky, which appeared at least a year ago 
and which I have made often, produces excellent jerky. However, at some point 
in my Food Guide readings, I came across a discussion of "safe cooking 
temperatures" and so called the United States Department of Agriculture to ask 
them about the slow drying at 150-degrees method. To my dismay, they did not 
recommend cooking any meat at lower than 325 and further to cook the meat to an 
internal temperature of 160. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: Our government takes such very good care of us. If we listened to 
and adhered to all government recommendations, I'm quite sure that death would 
be optional, 160 degrees, indeed. I'll have my steak rare and 130 degrees, 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Next time you call the USDA, try to talk to a food scientist about curing and 
drying, not cooking. Curing and drying are two of the oldest methods of food 
preservation known to man, and they have served us well. Enjoy your jerky. 
</P>
<P>
For more good sound scientific information on the subject, I recommend: "A 
Complete Guide to Home Meat Curing" available from Morton Salt Co., P.O. Box 
355, Argo, Ill. 60501. The price is $1 plus 25 cents, shipping and handling. 
Also recommended: "How to Dry Foods" by Deanna DeLong (HP Books). 
</P>
<P>
 -- MERLE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BUTCHER: This nutrition business certainly is out of hand and a pain in 
the neck. I am a retired old lady in my mid-'80s and terribly tired of hearing 
about cholesterol and what foods are good for you or terribly bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
I remember how in years long ago conversation at the dinner table with regard 
to food was about how good it looked and tasted and good recipes, etc. Those 
days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: I hope not. The tide already shows signs of swinging back to some 
of the nutritional common sense of yesteryear. More and more these days I am 
hearing scientists and nutritionists, dietitians and such recommend pretty much 
the same thing Grandma used to: a well-balanced diet from the four basic food 
groups; a little moderation, and "get off your duff and go do the chores, the 
exercise will do you good." 
</P>
<P>
The whole cholesterol issue is being hotly debated in scientific circles these 
days and one would hope that out of all the debate will come some truth and 
perhaps even some common sense. In the meantime, be grateful that there is 
still some conversation around your dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
The latest for the younger set, for whom even fast food isn't fast enough, is 
the computerized ordering system now in place at several Arby's Roast Beef 
Shops. Just step right up to the computer and punch in your order. Faced with a 
barrage of complains about slow service, Arby's installed the system for 
customers who no longer have time to spend. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR BUTCHER: When serving my family stuffed cabbage, the meat is always a 
bright pink. I suspect this is caused by some color additive in the ground 
meat. Am I right? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: The cause of the pink color is nitrate, but it's not something 
added to the meat. Rather, it's the naturally occurring nitrate in the cabbage. 
Nitrate is added to meat products like ham and hot dogs and other sausage 
products to prevent botulism, which is why those products have a pink color. 
But green leaf vegetables also contain nitrates. According to Dr. George York, 
a good friend and one of the leading food scientists in the country, cabbage 
has 50 to 100 parts-per-million nitrates, more than most hot dogs and more than 
enough to turn the meat in a cabbage roll pink. If you would like an even 
pinker color, wrap your meat in spinach that contains 1,500 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MERLE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MERLE: Why do I see so much seafood, pork ribs, beef ribs, etc., market 
with bright tags saying "Thawed, Previously Frozen"? Why in heaven's name don't 
they leave them frozen, omit the thawing? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: I don't know, but I suspect the reason markets thaw frozen meats 
is very likely because people won't buy them in the frozen state. And 
government regulations demand that we be told if the product has been frozen. 
If enough folks like you would ask for frozen seafood, pork and beef ribs, 
etc., you can bet markets would stop thawing them.

PEACHES CAN MAKE GREAT SIDE DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Add canned cling peaches to your repertory of side dishes for pretty and 
nutritious accompaniments to your favorite roasted meats. Hot stuffed cling 
peach halves are a pretty and delicious garnish for a roast. 
</P>
<P>
Simply drain the peaches, reserving the liquid for another use, and place in a 
shallow baking pan. Fill each peach with cranberry sauce and sprinkle with 
cinnamon sugar. Heat under the broiler until bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
Or stuff peach halves with chutney if the dinner menu calls for roast pork, 
with creamy horseradish for roast beef or with mint jelly for roast lamb. 
</P>
<P>
To brighten up frozen peas when served with meat loaf, chicken or pork, heat 
them with canned cling peach slices and 1/2 teaspoon crushed dried mint leaves. 
Drain and stir in 1 tablespoon butter or margarine before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Or warm turkey slices in liquid drained from canned cling peach slices. Stir in 
3 to 4 tablespoons butter or margarine, 2 tablespoons capers and 2 tablespoons 
lemon juice. Heat until bubbly. Add peach slices and heat through. Serve over 
parsley rice for an inviting dinner entree.

BILL TO PHASE OUT REFINERY ACID USE DIES IN ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. said last week that he appreciates "what Custer 
felt like . . . at the Little Big Horn," after heavy opposition led an Assembly 
committee to shelve his bill to phase out the use of hazardous hydrogen 
fluoride throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood Democrat acknowledged that he was disappointed by the setback, 
saying he does not think his colleagues "have the will yet to ensure the public 
safety over the profits of a few companies." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, heard Tuesday by the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxics 
Committee, would have forced oil refineries and other businesses to switch to 
safer substitutes, relocate to unpopulated areas or shut down operations. 
</P>
<P>
It was aimed at four refineries that use the chemical in the manufacture of 
unleaded gasoline: Mobil's Torrance facility, Ultramar's Wilmington plant, and 
the Powerine and Golden West refineries in Santa Fe Springs. It was also 
targeted at Allied-Signal Inc.'s plant in El Segundo, which uses hydrogen 
fluoride to make refrigerants. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said he expects to introduce a scaled-down proposal next year. Among 
other things, he suggested, the proposal might limit the amount of hydrogen 
fluoride that could be stored at an industrial plant or require back-up storage 
capacity in case an accident threatened to release the acid into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said he was prepared last week to add these provisions to the bill but 
failed to get a chance when Democrats on the committee persuaded him to send 
the bill to interim study, a move designed to prevent the bill from being heard 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the proposal said Tucker was well-intentioned but misguided in 
pushing for such a sweeping proposal that singled out one chemical for a 
phase-out. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), chair of the committee, said she 
would like her committee to examine the safety of hydrogen fluoride, the amount 
used in the state and ways to prevent a disaster. However, she said, "to ban 
(hydrogen fluoride) without further study is something we couldn't very well 
do." 
</P>
<P>
James Garibaldi, Allied-Signal's lobbyist, said Tucker's bill failed to get out 
of committee because it was poorly drafted and too sweeping. Officials of the 
Allied-Signal refrigerant plant said that in their business there are no 
substitutes for hydrogen fluoride. Enactment of the Tucker bill "would have 
shut us down and moved us out of the state of California," plant Manager Louis 
H. Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
One business lobbyist, who asked not to be identified, suggested that the 
Democrat-dominated committee also may have sought to shelve the bill because of 
opposition from the United Steelworkers of America, which represents 47 workers 
at the Allied-Signal plant. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Dixson, a staff representative for the steelworkers, acknowledged that 
union officials talked to Tanner and other committee members. Dixson expressed 
concern about the potential loss of jobs at Allied-Signal if the bill became 
law and the plant was forced to relocate or shut down. Dixson noted that labor 
played a significant role in Tucker's election last year, "and we're just a bit 
perplexed" by his bill.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS SENATE DISTRICT 31; 
</P>
<P>
HILL IS STRONG FAVORITE IN HEAVILY GOP 31ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been just more than three months since Gov. George Deukmejian scheduled 
the special election to replace veteran former state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights). 
</P>
<P>
A field of eight candidates was reduced to three in February after a vicious 
primary battle in which the campaigns combined to spend an estimated $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, voters in the 31st state Senate District will go to the polls in 
the general election to choose a new senator. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), the Republican nominee, is the favorite to 
win, largely because the seat is in the third most Republican Senate district 
in California. Republicans hold a registration advantage of about 54% to the 
Democrats' 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is opposed by Democrat Janice Graham and American Independent Party 
candidate Robert Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The district straddles the boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties and 
stretches from Whittier and West Covina on the north to Laguna Beach in the 
south. It also includes La Mirada and La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the campaign strategy for almost all of Hill's opponents has 
been to attack the Whittier assemblyman. And the two most common issues have 
been abortion and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who beat two other Democrats in the Feb. 6 primary, recently produced 
her only mailer for the general election campaign consisting of an eight-page 
attack on Hill. The mailer focuses on Hill's connection to a federal 
influence-peddling investigation in Sacramento that caused FBI agents to raid 
his office more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, meanwhile, has largely campaigned on his eight-year record in the 
Assembly and the support he has received from state Republican leaders, 
including campaign appearances from Deukmejian and Sen. Pete Wilson. His recent 
literature mailed to the district also highlights his local roots. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 36, grew up in Diamond Bar, graduated from Rowland High School and 
attended Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: PAYING A STIFF PRICE FOR THE PLEASURES OF TOURING; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGETS: LODGING COSTS SOARED IN THE 1980S, ESPECIALLY IN MAJOR EASTERN CITIES, 
SO ESTIMATE HIGH WHEN FIGURING YOUR PER-DIEM TRAVEL EXPENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When traveling for business or leisure, most people are on a budget, an expense 
account or per diem, with many of the expenses budgeted in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with most travel budgets, however, is that they are never 
realistic. And, in today's travel environment, with fares, rates, fees and 
restrictions changing almost daily, it is hard, if not impossible, to project 
costs. Yet virtually every company (and every traveler) tries. 
</P>
<P>
Even the federal government attempts to estimate daily expenses for travel. For 
example, the U.S. Department of State sets per-diem rates for government 
employees and their dependents traveling abroad on official business. The rates 
are based on what the department estimates is the cost of "adequate, moderately 
priced meals and lodging." 
</P>
<P>
These per-diem rates include estimates on tax and tips as well as incidental 
expenses such as dry cleaning and laundry. The figures provide a basis of cost 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the government estimates a per diem this month of about $140 in 
Moscow, slightly under $200 in Tokyo and $125 in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimated costs now to five years ago, per diem in Moscow in 1985 was 
$100, while in Paris it was $80 (today it's $175). In almost each case the per 
diem has more than doubled in five years. 
</P>
<P>
You can order the entire list of per-diem rates for $1.50 by sending a check 
made out to Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402-9371. Ask for the document "U.S. Department of State 
Maximum Travel Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas." 
</P>
<P>
But while the State Department per-diem estimates provide a valid comparison of 
costs, do they reflect what other travelers will spend on trips? The answer is 
no. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, State Department per-diem estimates have been very low. In 
addition, most per-diem allowances are for countries, not cities, and do not 
reflect individual differences in prices and rates, which can be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
They do provide, however, a good measure of what travel costs will not be. 
Knowing this, many corporate travel planners take the government's figures and 
add about 40% for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many of those figures no longer come close to costs. 
Specifically, U.S. lodging costs in the 1980s, according to the Consulting 
Services Division of Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis.-based 
management consulting firm, were much more volatile than meal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Based on average prices for business-class hotels and restaurants, Runzheimer 
reported that lodging costs nationwide rose 107% between 1980 and 1989. Meal 
costs rose only 44%. A look at cities shows an even wider disparity. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., for example, lodging costs rose a whopping 176%. Boston 
business-class hotels raised their rates 155%. During that same decade the 
consumer price index (the nation's barometer of inflation) rose only 50.4%. 
</P>
<P>
New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta also chalked up huge increases. 
Chicago and New York City lodging rates jumped 135%, Los Angeles and Chicago 
112%. 
</P>
<P>
Rental-car prices zoomed as much as 94%. Meal costs also moved up. Boston food 
prices jumped 72% and Detroit rose 66%. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the hotel and food news, however, is bad. According to the 
Runzheimer report, hoteliers in Dallas increased their lodging rates 53%, and 
in Minneapolis 78%, in 10 years. Also, it was cheaper to eat in Dallas. 
Business travelers to Dallas today are finding that meals increased in price 
only 26% in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously this means that most per-diem rates set by companies are unrealistic, 
and not in keeping with price increases in the various cities. Whenever 
possible, try to negotiate an air fare, a room rate or a car-rental fee in 
advance and confirm that fee in writing, even if it means putting down a 
deposit. If the rates go up, you're protected. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one survey in Denver showed that in the fourth-quarter of 1989, 
fare hikes by airlines serving Colorado boosted travel costs by 21% compared to 
the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
If the rates go down, you can negotiate a refund or a lower rate before you 
travel. But don't count on it.

EX-CONVICT'S UNION ROLE AT ISSUE IN TEAMSTERS RACE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: A CHALLENGER SAYS A FORMER LEADER WHO SERVED TIME FOR A FELONY RUNS 
THE LOCAL THROUGH A 'PUPPET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The former head of the Teamsters Union local for Ventura County truckers, 
Martin W. Fry, is an ex-convict who now holds a clerk's job with the union in 
Oxnard but is accused of running it from behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Fry's successor as head of Teamsters Local 186 is Greg Boverson, a large, 
bearded man in leather jacket and snakeskin boots who says he rides a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle to periodically escape the pressures of his job. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Shaw is the leader of a union reform movement and claims that Fry still 
controls the Teamsters in Ventura County. He wants to oust both Fry and 
Boverson, whom he denounces as "the ex-con and his puppet." 
</P>
<P>
These are three of the main characters slugging it out in a tangled union 
election this month in Ventura County -- a classic union power struggle 
unfolding in the colorful tradition that has marked national Teamsters politics 
since the days of Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
The charges and countercharges in the election have grown more complicated as 
the Department of Labor has launched an investigation into the Teamsters local. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Department investigators will not discuss the matter. But a subpoena 
issued last month for the local's financial records, telephone logs and other 
records follows allegations made to the department in a formal complaint filed 
Dec. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In that complaint, dissident Teamsters members accused Fry of negotiating 
contracts, making managerial decisions and electioneering since his release 
from prison two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a felon convicted of embezzlement, Fry is prohibited by federal law from 
conducting any union business other than strictly clerical or janitorial work. 
He will be free from these constraints in 1992, five years after his release 
from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Fry, who earns $36,000 a year and drives a union car, denies that he has helped 
negotiate contracts or performed any duties other than those of a clerk. "Each 
employer has different standards of what a clerk should do," Fry said in an 
interview. For the most part, he said, he has been helping union members with 
their pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
He also denies that he told fellow Teamsters members that he plans to reclaim 
the top job when his five-year parole is up in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy doing things from where I am," he said. "You can be more creative 
behind the scenes than being out front. I'm talking about doing things for the 
members, not manipulating things." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the political controversy can be traced to 1978 when Fry, then 
secretary-treasurer of the Local 186, and other Teamsters organized employees 
at Redman Moving and Storage Co. in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The company refused to recognize the union and fell victim to a campaign of 
fear, threats and violence designed to put Redman out of business, court 
documents show. Vandals slashed more than 100 tires, shot out windows and 
burned two trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force indicted Fry and others 
for conspiring to burn the trucks. Ultimately, a jury convicted Fry of 
embezzling union funds by paying for the gasoline in a car used to follow a 
Redman truck across state lines for the purpose of setting it ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
Before his trial, Fry visited Raymond A. Gonzales, a former member of Fry's 
staff who had turned federal witness against him. In a scuffle next to a 
workbench, Fry hit Gonzales in the head at least twice with a ballpeen hammer, 
Gonzales said in police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales tried to press charges, but the district attorney's office could find 
no one to corroborate his story. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our conclusion that it probably happened the way Gonzales said it did, 
but it was impossible to prove," said Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, after 
reviewing the 10-year-old file. "It came down to one man's word against 
another's." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a reform slate led by Shaw, Gonzales is now running a Latino 
reformist slate against Boverson and the entire union board of trustees. In his 
view, the board has, tacitly or otherwise, approved Boverson's actions and 
failed to remove Fry from the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Board members protest that they have done everything they could to rid the 
union of Fry -- and Boverson for that matter. They passed a resolution calling 
for Fry's dismissal. They brought internal charges against Boverson in an 
effort to force him to resign or remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
But their attempt to oust Boverson was overruled by higher Teamsters 
authorities in Los Angeles after Fry prepared an elaborate defense for 
Boverson. And the resolution to oust Fry was thwarted by the union's bylaws, 
which give Boverson, as secretary-treasurer, exclusive power to hire and fire 
Fry or other employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to clean our own house, but it seemed like the harder we worked the 
harder it got," said Pat Mansfield, a Wonder Bread truck driver and president 
of the local Teamsters board of trustees, defending the board's own reform 
efforts against its current critics. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn, Mansfield said, Fry was there to tie the board in legal knots. 
"He is no dummy in the way he does things," Mansfield said. "We got outfoxed, 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
Mansfield said the board's unsuccessful efforts to dump Boverson and Fry led a 
majority of board members to become actively involved in the current election 
as supporters of Shaw, a union business agent and trustee who is the leading 
reform candidate challenging Boverson for secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Mansfield and five other union officials have joined Shaw's slate, running a 
campaign that is summed up in the headline of one campaign flyer: "Your Local 
Is Being Run by an Ex-Con." 
</P>
<P>
To hear Mansfield and other board members tell it, Boverson may be the head of 
the local Teamsters, but Martin Fry holds the reins. "Marty runs the show, 
there's no doubt about it," Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Even during the 21 months that Fry spent in Lompoc Federal Penitentiary, Fry's 
critics say, he was in constant communication with union officials. "He'd call 
the local 10 times a day," said Aurora (Junior) Ramirez, office manager of the 
local, who is also a member of Shaw's slate. "He'd want to know about this 
contract or that deal." 
</P>
<P>
When Fry returned from prison to become a union clerk, he was a changed man, 
Ramirez said. The man who had been her boss, who had taught her 17 years 
earlier that the needs of the union membership always came first, was now 
renouncing his altruistic code. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Last time I was a fool thinking it was all for the members. This 
next time, when I'm secretary-treasurer, we'll drive the best cars, make big 
money and send Greg down the road to ride his Harley and pick up his check once 
a week.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fry denies saying this. "That is an outright lie." 
</P>
<P>
About this time, Ramirez said, she grew weary of "baby-sitting" Boverson. She 
said he has been a largely absentee executive with sloppy business practices 
such as leaving signed, blank checks on her desk when she wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
These two factors persuaded Ramirez to endorse Shaw's campaign and sign onto 
his slate as a candidate for recording secretary, the person who takes minutes 
at board meetings. The rival union leaders agree that she is a very influential 
and trusted Teamster who is popular among union members. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of her political pull, Fry took Ramirez to lunch in February to 
persuade her to run for the top job of secretary-treasurer. "He said he would 
drop Greg and support me and I would win," Ramirez said. She declined the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just nonsense talk," Fry said of the conversation. "I never said I 
would drop Greg." 
</P>
<P>
Boverson alternates between anger and hurt feelings over how the board has 
turned against him and his mentor Fry. Even though he said he understands Fry 
is a political liability as an ex-convict, he said he has not considered 
releasing Fry from his payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times does this man have to pay for something?" Boverson said. "He 
has already lost his family, three years of his life. He wasn't stealing for 
himself -- he wasn't stealing. He wasn't doing anything for himself; he was 
doing it for the union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the union can't stick up for those who are downtrodden, then what are we 
here for?" Boverson said. "If I went down there and threw out everybody who had 
a jail record, we wouldn't have very many people left." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw praises Boverson as an affable but not particularly effective leader. As 
the campaign has moved into full swing, the focus has shifted primarily to Fry. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg is really not a factor," Shaw said. "He is a pitiful bystander. He has 
little to do with what's going on other than being Marty's puppet and a tool in 
Marty Fry's game plan to regain power of the union." 
</P>
<P>
Boverson denies that he follows Fry's orders. "I am my own guy," he said. "The 
only thing I might be guilty of is asking advice from a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
In attacking Boverson, Shaw's campaign literature accuses Boverson of 
incompetence and mismanagement in many decisions, including selling a Teamsters 
office building in Carpinteria below value. Shaw says the building was sold 
partly because of declining membership dues and partly to pay Fry $100,000 he 
was owed in a union savings plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Boverson campaign has countered with charges that Shaw was unable to hold 
down a job before Fry hired him five years ago. The campaign's most recent 
flyer accuses Shaw of secretly plotting to merge the Local 186 with another 
Teamsters local in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Some members would lose seniority," the flyer says. "How would a merger affect 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said he once briefly discussed the issue with another Teamsters official, 
but has no interest in merging with another local. "The people supporting me 
would flip if they thought that was true," Shaw said. "Of course, it's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, an independent firm mailed ballots to the 2,857 full-time and 
seasonal members of Teamsters Local 186. About 80% of the members work in 
Ventura County, the remainder in Santa Barbara County. The ballots are due back 
for counting April 20.

The word NIMBY was coined several years ago to stigmatize those people who 
openly opposed such developments as hazardous-waste treatment plants, loud rock 
'n' roll concert amphitheaters or other undesirable projects in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
This word was derived from the first letter of each word in the phrase Not in 
my back yard. 
</P>
<P>
I have noticed two characteristics of people who call other people NIMBYs. 
First, they never live near the area that will be adversely impacted by the 
proposed project. Second, they appear to be in a position to reap a financial 
gain if the proposed project is built. 
</P>
<P>
I have coined a new word for these NIMBY bashers. I call them HAYBYs, which is 
derived from the phrase How about your back yard? 
</P>
<P>
I have yet to find a HAYBY who is willing to accept a NIMBY-type project in his 
neighborhood.

STATES USING DEATH PENALTY MUST NOT LOOK AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, Amy Wallace is a Times staff writer in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, I witnessed the execution of Timothy Wesley McCorquodale, a 
35-year-old former motorcycle gang member from Georgia's rural Appling County 
who had been convicted of the 1974 torture and murder of a runaway girl. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't have to do it. My editor at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said he 
wouldn't make me cover something that he couldn't stomach. And I didn't 
particularly want to do it. I had never seen a corpse, let alone a killing, and 
I was sure it would leave me with ugly memories. 
</P>
<P>
But I decided to do it because I thought it was my job. I covered prisons, and 
if the state of Georgia was going to electrocute inmates, the residents of 
Georgia ought to know what that meant -- and what it looked and sounded like. 
</P>
<P>
As the state of California struggles to resume executions after a 23-year 
hiatus, I am reminded of that warm September evening when I watched 
McCorquodale die. Contrary to my expectations, however, my most frightening 
memory is not the jolt of electricity or the generator's roar. What was most 
frightening was how Georgia's prison officials made killing look so easy. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 p.m. on Sept. 21, 1987, two guards led McCorquodale through a red door 
and into the small death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification 
Center. Placing both his hands on the armrests, the 6-foot-1-inch, 270-pound 
inmate hoisted himself into the electric chair that inmates had built out of 
sturdy Georgia pine. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, there would be no single executioner. To spare any individual the job 
of killing, the state had divided each electrocution into dozens of tasks, and 
prison employees were asked to volunteer for just one. On this day, dozens of 
people would perform the many rituals that, altogether, would lead to 
McCorquodale's death. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that afternoon, one guard had served him his last meal: boiled shrimp, 
crab legs, tossed salad with thousand island dressing and apple pie a la mode. 
Another prison official had tape-recorded a private statement that would be 
stored in the prison archives, and the prison barber had shaved McCorquodale's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Now, six guards surrounded him. In a carefully choreographed procedure, they 
fastened 10 leather straps around McCorquodale's body, cinching them tight. The 
guards exited and a prison electrician attached two electrodes to wet sponges 
at the top of the inmate's head and on his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale sat still, his eyes distant. Thirteen years before, the former 
Marine had taken part in a killing that the Georgia Supreme Court called the 
most depraved ever to come before it. Witnesses testified that he and another 
man had raped, tortured and strangled 17-year-old Donna Marie Dixon before 
McCorquodale broke her neck with his bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to punish him for his heinous crime, the state was going to send 2,000 
volts surging through his body. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale was asked for his last words. He looked through a plate glass 
window at the witnesses, about a dozen reporters, prison officials and members 
of his family, and gave the thumbs-up sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to tell my dad and everybody with him I love them very much," he 
said, looking toward his father, who watched without flinching, his face 
motionless. "Stay strong in Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Guards pulled a chin strap tight, to hold his head steady. Then they tied a 
leather mask over his face, hiding his blue eyes from view. The prison chaplain 
said a prayer, gave McCorquodale's arm a reassuring squeeze, and left him alone 
in the chamber. As McCorquodale waited for the charge, his breathing stirred 
the mask. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:15 p.m., three volunteers pushed three buttons, only one of which 
activated the electrocution device. The charge hit McCorquodale and, despite 
the leather straps, it threw him back in the chair. His massive chest 
contracted, his body tightened and his fists began to redden. 
</P>
<P>
After four seconds, the voltage automatically decreased from 2,000 to 1,200 
volts, and, after eight more seconds, decreased again to 220 volts. After 
exactly two minutes, the generator shut off automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Without the whir of the generator, the room was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Then began a six-minute "cool down period," during which McCorquodale's bodily 
fluids were allowed to settle and return to their normal temperature. Two 
doctors then entered the chamber, listened for a heartbeat and pronounced the 
inmate dead. 
</P>
<P>
That story got a lot of negative reaction. Many newspaper readers wrote and 
called to say that they were sickened by it and found it hard to read. Shielded 
by the systematized, anonymous execution process, most Georgians had been able 
to ignore the details. More than a few said they wished we hadn't printed them. 
</P>
<P>
The more the death penalty becomes familiar, the less attention it commands. 
But residents of states that employ the ultimate punishment should not be 
allowed to turn their heads. State-sanctioned executions tell people that 
killing is all right, in certain circumstances. That is a dangerous message, 
because the more callous society becomes to the taking of life, the less 
vigilant it will be in protecting it. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale was the 12th man to be electrocuted in Georgia since the state 
resumed executions in 1983. Since then, two more men have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
As California tries to resume its executions, politicians would do well to look 
to the South, where the frequent use of the death penalty has made it less 
remarkable -- and ultimately less troublesome -- to the very people who 
sanction it.

<P>
Which reminds me of another story. One day, Warden Ralph Kemp, who oversaw 
Georgia's death row, invited me into his office. There, on his desk, was a 
miniature electric chair. He motioned toward it. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be surprised how heavy it is," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
On cue, I picked it up. The shock was weak, but painfully surprising. I gasped 
and dropped the battery-charged electric chair on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"Gotcha," he said. And then he laughed.

CAR ACCIDENTS LEAD TO CALL FOR CANOGA AVENUE BARRICADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Woodland Hills homeowners -- upset by what they say is an 
intolerable number of fatal accidents on their street -- want to put the brakes 
on commuters using Canoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Canoga Avenue Residents for Safety have launched a campaign to erect 
a permanent barrier at the southern end of the street so that it no longer 
connects Mulholland Drive and Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition to City Councilman Marvin Braude asking that the street be turned 
into a cul-de-sac, Gia B. Koontz, a founding member of CARS, wrote that "Canoga 
Avenue should be reclaimed by its residents" from speeding commuters who she 
said are "endangering their own lives as well as residents." 
</P>
<P>
But police say turning Canoga into a cul-de-sac would simply divert problems to 
other, more dangerous streets already choked with traffic. Although they are 
sympathetic to the homeowners who want a quiet, safe street, police say heavy 
traffic, speeding and accidents are not unique to Canoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Canoga Avenue shares the problems of many other streets in the San Fernando 
Valley," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Dennis Zine. "If the answer is to erect 
cul-de-sacs, where do we stop? 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody developed the concept that their street is a private street, what 
would you do with traffic? That is a public street paid for by public taxes," 
he said. "Our answer is more responsible driving." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Braude said the councilman will consider the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
South of Ventura Boulevard, Canoga Avenue has the look and feel of a country 
road. Built in the mid-1920s by the original developer of Woodland Hills, the 
twisting, narrow street, lined with peppertrees and single-family dwellings, 
lacks sidewalks and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years on that stretch of the street, there have been at least 
two fatal accidents and one that caused serious injuries. In a fourth incident, 
a 5-year-old boy playing outside his home was knocked across the street when he 
was struck by a hit-and-run driver. The child was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, on March 25, 19-year-old Carlos Ramirez was killed when he lost 
control of his car, struck a fire hydrant and a tree, then came to rest on a 
resident's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors "watched the life drain from his body as we stood under torrents of 
water from the broken hydrant and listened to the unnerving sound of his 
crashed automobile horn," which blared continuously for half an hour afterward, 
Koontz said. 
</P>
<P>
That experience, she said, galvanized neighbors to try to have their street 
turned into a cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third time I have had to assist in an emergency crash in front of 
my home," she said. "I am ready to move, but I don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, after a yearlong campaign by members of CARS, Los Angeles 
transportation officials lowered the speed limit on Canoga between Dumetz Road 
and Mulholland from 30 m.p.h. to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
During that campaign, neighborhood leaders confronted city officials with 
results of a poll of 73 area families. Three-fourths of those surveyed had 
witnessed recent traffic accidents near their homes; two-thirds had suffered 
property damage, including uprooted trees, shrubs and mailboxes, as a result of 
car accidents. But Koontz and other neighbors said the reduction in the speed 
limit has not stopped speeding on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I lie in bed at night and I hear cars going 80, and I am not exaggerating," 
said Marilyn Vail, another supporter of the cul-de-sac proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Vail said most accidents on the street are caused by commuters who use it as a 
shortcut from Mulholland to Ventura Boulevard. Local residents, they said, 
drive more slowly and carefully. "The people who live here are not the people 
who cause the accidents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz believes that she has the support of the area residents, but to be sure, 
this weekend she is circulating a petition to 200 homes in the neighborhood 
asking for opinions on the cul-de-sac proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles Police Officer Tim Wells, who patrols Canoga Avenue, said the 
speed limit reduction has been effective. He said fewer people are cited for 
speeding now than in previous years, and police radar has shown that the 
average speed on the street has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
While Wells admits that traffic on Canoga Avenue has increased over past years, 
he said many of the cars come from housing developments just south of 
Mulholland, in areas next to Canoga Avenue. He said those residents have a 
right to use the street. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles firefighters oppose turning the street into a cul-de-sac because it 
is their primary access route to housing tracts south of Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that delays our response time means that fires are getting bigger, 
and that people who need emergency services wouldn't get it," said Los Angeles 
City Fire Department Capt. John Holloway. "It is certainly the biggest street 
around" for access to "a number of residences and small streets." 
</P>
<P>
But Koontz said the barricade at the end of Canoga could be an iron gate that 
firefighters could open with a remote control. 
</P>
<P>
Vail called a barrier "a necessary thing to preserve life."

8 CANDIDATES GO DOOR TO DOOR IN RACE FOR 3 SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Tuesday's election for three seats on the San Fernando City Council, there 
are no big spenders, and eight candidates are campaigning the old-fashioned way 
-- by walking door to door. 
</P>
<P>
As of March 24, the candidates had raised a combined total of less than $15,000 
and only two candidates -- Mayor Daniel Acuna and Councilman Doude Wysbeek -- 
anticipated spending more than $5,000 each. Planning Commissioner Mary Jane 
Tuomy and write-in candidate Victoria Phillips said their campaign expenses 
would be less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's silly to spend lots of money in a small town like ours," said 
Tuomy, who estimated that her expenses will be about $265 for campaign flyers. 
"I've just been going door to door." 
</P>
<P>
Also running for seats on the 2.4-square-mile city's governing body are 
Planning Commissioner Jose Hernandez, community activists Linda Jauron and 
Gabriel (Gabe) Rodriguez, and Robert Villafana, a city parks and recreation 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign statements filed with City Hall, Acuna has raised more 
than $5,673. Wysbeek was second in fund raising with $4,148. Hernandez reported 
$2,170 in contributions, including $250 from Councilman Jess Margarito. 
Rodriguez and Jauron had collected $1,475 and $1,343, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Tuomy, Phillips and Villafana did not file detailed financial statements 
because they said they had less than $1,000 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are conducting low-key campaigns using tried-and-true tactics -- 
distributing flyers, putting up signs in supporters' yards, sending out mailers 
and appearing at public forums. 
</P>
<P>
All said they have personally contacted as many voters as possible. 
Nonetheless, city officials said, a 30% voter turnout Tuesday would be a high 
percentage for a City Council election in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of the city's 22,000 people are Latino; more than 65% of its 5,763 
registered voters are Democrats. However, the candidates agree on most issues, 
including the need to deal with graffiti, gangs, crowded and decaying housing, 
and parking. The campaign has been upbeat and free of racial or political 
labeling. 
</P>
<P>
All want to attract new businesses while preserving the city's small-town 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"By walking and talking to people, I've found that they don't want many major 
changes," Hernandez said. "They like the city's single-family residential 
character." 
</P>
<P>
Following are brief descriptions of the candidates and their views: 
</P>
<P>
* Acuna, 49, a Sepulveda real estate agent, was elected four years ago to 
become part of the first Latino majority on the City Council. He said he wants 
to help continue programs the present council initiated, including the building 
of replacement housing in the city's decaying neighborhoods and the creation of 
a strong economic base so that the city can remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna said city leaders also have initiated a capital improvements program that 
includes a new police building and senior citizens center, both completed; the 
remodeling of City Hall, now under way, and the renovation of Las Palmas Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the City Council must, among other things, initiate water 
conservation and recycling programs, create opportunities for first-time buyers 
to purchase housing, expand parks and recreation programs and attract a better 
variety of businesses to the community, Acuna said. 
</P>
<P>
* Hernandez, 59, a 20-year resident of San Fernando, is a professor of urban 
studies at Cal State Northridge. He has served on the city's Planning 
Commission for 2 1/2 years. He said his work there provided practical 
experience for serving on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council should form a commission to deal with the city's housing problems, 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people living in garages here," he said. "If the city enforced its 
codes to the maximum, these people could be thrown out in the streets. On the 
other hand, if something isn't done about the problem, the neighborhood is 
disrupted. The problem should be studied." 
</P>
<P>
* A businesswoman and community activist, Jauron, 41, said child care, housing, 
parks and recycling are among her biggest concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talk about child care, I'm talking about children of all ages, any 
child under 18," she said. "We need year-round, after-school parks and 
recreation programs, especially now that our schools are going year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"The gang issue is something that's becoming more prominent. Another student 
was killed last weekend. First we need to recognize that we have a gang 
problem. Then we have to take a real hard line about who's responsible." 
</P>
<P>
* Phillips, 37, who entered the race as a write-in candidate three weeks ago, 
is president of the Mission Council PTA. She said gangs, drugs, housing and 
graffiti are problems facing the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to bring back that city pride San Fernando used to have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips also would like the city to initiate recreation and school programs 
that would bring senior citizens and youths together. 
</P>
<P>
* Rodriguez, 66, a native of San Fernando, described himself as a community 
activist. He said that housing and parking are the city's biggest problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to face reality," he said. "I don't see how we can keep all 
our single-family neighborhoods. I think future housing should be multifamily." 
</P>
<P>
Double-decked parking structures should be built to accommodate the city's 
civic center and downtown business area, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
* Tuomy, 68, a 40-year resident of the city, has been a planning commissioner 
for six years, two of those as chairman. She also was a parks and recreation 
commissioner for six years and is active as a volunteer with various community 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Creating affordable housing heads Tuomy's list of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see us get a senior retirement hotel," she said. "Then, seniors 
would not be forced to move out of San Fernando. Something needs to be done 
about the aging housing. Some of it can be rehabilitated . . . I'd like to see 
this city become the little jewel it once was." 
</P>
<P>
* Villafana, 45, who calls himself an "idea person," is a social worker and has 
served on the Parks and Recreation Commission for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the ability to conceptualize things, to come up with ideas to benefit 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Villafana said he wants to improve the health, safety, education and quality of 
life of all San Fernando residents. If elected, he said, he would work toward 
initiating a "We Tip" program to help police fight crime and toward hiring a 
permanent city graffiti-removal coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
* A former mayor, Wysbeek, 50, was first elected to the City Council in 1982 
but was defeated in his bid for a second term in 1986. Last year, the council 
appointed him to complete the unexpired council term of Roy Richardson, who 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Wysbeek, a small-business owner, said that during his tenure, the council has 
set up long-range programs that have made the city financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now time to go forward on housing and the general appearance of the 
city," he said. "We need to bring our parks and recreation programs back up to 
par." 
</P>
<P>
Wysbeek said all residents of the city must work together as "a total 
community" and not become separated by cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have a good cohesiveness," he said. "We must maintain that 
atmosphere."

A COMMUNITY IN TRANSITION; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH HOLLYWOOD: PUBLIC INTEREST IN PROPOSALS FOR THE REVITALIZATION OF THE 
AREA HAS WANED. DECISIONS STILL MUST BE MADE ON HOW TO SPEND MILLIONS AVAILABLE 
FOR URBAN RENEWAL PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Community involvement in the multimillion-dollar North Hollywood Redevelopment 
plan has plunged to the lowest level in the project's history -- at a time when 
critical decisions over the area's revitalization are about to be made. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency will soon mount a campaign to seek public 
opinion as it begins a long process that would empower the agency to spend tens 
of millions of tax dollars to continue urban renewal in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The agency will soon reach the $89-million cap imposed when the project was 
created in 1979 and no new development can be funded until an amendment is 
approved by CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the direction of redevelopment in North Hollywood. Will public 
money be used to stimulate further development of an upscale business and 
office district or to rehabilitate houses and encourage home ownership? Or, 
will the North Hollywood of the future be a combination of the two, a 
commercial center that doubles as a bustling community for those who live 
there? 
</P>
<P>
The next year will tell. Local redevelopment officials are beginning to prepare 
studies and schedule public hearings on the future of the 740-acre 
redevelopment zone, once a prosperous San Fernando Valley commercial center 
that deteriorated in the 1960s with the advent of shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
More than $44 million has already been spent to buy old commercial buildings 
clustered around Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards, clearing the way for two 
towering office buildings and transformation of decaying houses into a street 
flanked by stucco apartment buildings. New curbs and sidewalks line residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the funds has been earmarked to pay interest on bonds and buy 
land for another office complex at Magnolia and Lankershim and a shopping 
center less than a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The impending call for public comment comes at a time when few in the community 
are talking to the officials who are directing the North Hollywood 
redevelopment plans. When initial plans for redevelopment were being drafted, 
more than 200 people would attend monthly community meetings, concerned about 
the impact of redevelopment in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, though, only a handful of residents and business owners have 
attended monthly community meetings. Currently, nine seats on a citizens 
advisory board are vacant, and 16 positions are filled mainly with repeat 
members. 
</P>
<P>
But while a spectrum of community voices are absent from most public meetings, 
on the street and in the neighborhoods, disparate views -- from enthusiastic to 
frustrated -- abound over the effects of the changing face of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials and members of the citizens advisory board, called the 
Project Area Committee, or PAC, say the lack of public participation is a 
reflection of agreement and satisfaction with the direction of North Hollywood 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a wonderful homogeneous group in both community attendance and on the 
PAC itself," said Ada Klevans, chairwoman of the citizens panel, and a tenant 
of a senior citizen housing complex built with redevelopment funds. "Our 
projects are progressing beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
PAC members volunteer their time to attend monthly advisory meetings with CRA 
staff. They say their input over the last years has influenced nuts and bolts 
improvements such as landscaping and the look of apartment buildings, and has 
helped to preserve several small businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But some North Hollywood merchants, residents and former PAC members say that 
many in the community feel overwhelmed by a complex redevelopment process that 
was set in motion a decade ago. They perceive the CRA officials and community 
advisers -- a panel comprised primarily of business owners -- to be a tightly 
knit, entrenched group of longtime members who are intent on carrying out the 
early development plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like they are the big boys and we are the least men on the totem pole," 
said Norman Zalben, 35, president of Western Surplus, a business started by his 
father 30 years ago. His property at Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards has 
been condemned to make room for street widening and an office tower. "I have 
tried to keep in touch with redevelopment, but the plans seemed etched in 
stone. So what's the point of voicing opinions?" 
</P>
<P>
Others have surfaced to criticize the plan. Members were put on the defensive 
when ousted members of Hollywood's redevelopment advisory committee attended a 
North Hollywood meeting and accused the North Hollywood PAC of conducting 
unfair elections last month. 
</P>
<P>
The elections to fill nine vacant seats were called off when two members left 
in anger and a quorum was lost. In a heated exchange over election procedures, 
the meeting later degenerated into a pushing and shoving match between several 
in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The next PAC meeting will be in early May. No decision has been made as to 
whether another election will be held. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area, said he is generally pleased 
with the progress of North Hollywood renewal and the work of the PAC members 
although he said "it is disappointing that there is not more interest." 
</P>
<P>
"If people have gripes they must let me know. It's not our intention for this 
to run roughshod over people when we are looking to improve an area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Tague, chief of operation for the CRA, said that his staff "wants to 
come up with a long- range plan with the community. We are recommending that 
redevelopment proceed because we are looking at an unfinished job. We will 
identify work programs that could be done and will look to the community and 
the City Council for public policy discussions." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on public input comes as the CRA is under intense scrutiny by the 
Los Angeles City Council over a mammoth $5-billion spending proposal and policy 
decisions over the redevelopment of the downtown central business district. 
Advocates for the poor charge that the CRA has ignored social needs in favor of 
subsidizing high-rise developers. 
</P>
<P>
In North Hollywood, however, most of the criticism has been leveled at what 
most call sluggish renewal in an area that has been blighted for more than a 
decade. Only in the past year have a number of obvious signs of redevelopment 
emerged: 
</P>
<P>
* In about three months, the long-awaited office, hotel and commercial project 
known as The Academy will open at the corner of Lankershim and Magnolia. The 
$41-million business center is widely viewed as the linchpin that will set the 
pace for future commercial development in the commercial core of the 
redevelopment zone. The project also includes 258 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 1,400 apartment units -- including 865 units of CRA-financed units 
-- have been built or are under construction in the zone, flanking residential 
streets with tall stucco complexes. 
</P>
<P>
* The widening of busy Magnolia Boulevard from Tujunga Avenue to Lankershim 
Boulevard, long a potholed and bumpy two-lane thoroughfare, is nearing 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
Previously approved plans not yet under construction include a 
supermarket-anchored shopping center on the southeast corner of Magnolia 
Boulevard and Vineland Avenue, an office building on the northwest corner of 
Lankershim and Magnolia and a 75-unit apartment complex at Harmony Avenue and 
Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the amendment process to seek more spending power, the CRA is also 
seeking to extend for 12 more years its authority to condemn private property 
so land can be cleared for new development. The amendment will ultimately 
require Los Angeles City Council and mayoral approval. 
</P>
<P>
As CRA-financed projects take shape and longtime business owners such as Zalben 
are forced out to make way for apartment buildings and office complexes, a 
picture emerges of a community in transition. 
</P>
<P>
Standing inside her recently opened upscale dress shop on Lankershim Boulevard, 
an enthusiastic Sandra Guttman looks toward an office and commercial complex 
under construction across the street and proclaims that Lankershim "is going to 
be another Melrose," referring to the trendy Los Angeles commercial strip. 
"Redevelopment is cleaning up this area." 
</P>
<P>
She reflects the optimism and excitement of those who have pegged their future 
on a vision of North Hollywood transformed into a bustling office and 
commercial district where daytime workers and weekend shoppers will spend money 
at boutiques and restaurants. A new commercial center, where developments such 
as the Academy project -- so named because it will be the headquarters of the 
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences -- will attract free-spending tourists 
eager to visit a television hall of fame and snap photos in front of a 
40-foot-tall statue of an Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, however, they see redevelopment from a different 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Borel, the longtime owner of Valley Book City, a musty-smelling store 
crammed with used books, nodded toward the Academy building and lamented that 
"redevelopment is for the tourists and the very rich, not for the people who 
live here." 
</P>
<P>
Borel and others who have survived the hard times in North Hollywood expressed 
a feeling of betrayal by a community plan that they believe is more focused on 
attracting office towers and boutiques than rehabilitating "mom and pop" 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Zalben agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been serving North Hollywood for 30 years, supplying goods that the 
community needed. We catered to the blue collar guy, selling shirts, work 
clothes, footwear," said Zalben, who has not yet found a location in North 
Hollywood to move his business. "Tell me," he asked, "how is the community 
better served by the removal of a successful business?" 
</P>
<P>
A mile away, Jeff Welburn was tearing out old kitchen cabinets to remodel his 
home with the help of a $22,000 low-interest redevelopment loan. Welburn found 
out about the availability of the loan in a casual conversation with a real 
estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who started redevelopment should be out here trying to go that 
extra yard so people know there is a helping hand to fix houses up." Welburn 
said. "A lot of houses out here really need help. If I don't see more interest 
in this neighborhood I won't stay here for long." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the issue of preserving the housing stock in single-family 
neighborhoods and promoting home ownership is an issue that many, including 
current and former PAC members, say has been neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Although zoning approved in 1983 allows for large swaths of high- and 
medium-density housing in the southern and middle sections of the zone, some 
are concerned that rampant construction of apartments -- rather than townhouses 
or condominiums -- is creating a high ratio of tenants to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by The Times' marketing research department show that in 
1989, about 75% of the population inside the redevelopment zone were renters, 
compared to 60% of the general population in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing but rental units are being built. That doesn't make for a balanced 
community," said Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn., 
who served on the PAC for the past two years. "I'm convinced that we need to 
build a mix of housing and adopt a policy that promotes ownership especially 
for first-time buyers." 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the program, more than $4.1 million in public funds has 
been spent for low-interest loans that have rehabilitated 898 housing units, 
including apartments, according to CRA statistics. An additional $8.8 million 
in public money has helped to build 865 apartment units, 335 of which were set 
aside for low-income renters. 
</P>
<P>
About $29 million has been spent to buy and clear land for commercial projects, 
mainly for the Academy and the Hewlett-Packard headquarters built at the same 
intersection in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the PAC called on CRA to develop a program to build subsidized, 
owner-occupied housing, a idea that Tague said is "on the shelf because 
home-ownership programs cost money and our financial resources don't allow for 
it now." 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be widespread support among homeowners and business leaders 
for an amendment that will allow for increased tax revenue spending in North 
Hollywood. PAC members are hopeful that the amendment process will prompt more 
people in the community to voice their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like a fuller complement of representatives, but I don't know where 
they are and why they don't come forward," said Don Eitner, a PAC member and 
executive director of the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. "We welcome 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency helps finance commercial development, 
housing and public works projects largely with property tax revenue generated 
from new construction inside a redevelopment zone. The agency uses its power to 
condemn properties to purchase land in blighted areas at comparatively low 
prices and sells it cheaply to developers. 
</P>
<P>
As new buildings are constructed, property taxes increase, boosting the amount 
of money at the disposal of the CRA for new redevelopment projects. The revenue 
is called tax increment. Under state law, a cap on tax increment spending must 
be established when a redevelopment zone is created. The $89-million North 
Hollywood spending cap was approved by the Los Angeles City Council and Mayor 
Tom Bradley.

POOR SEEKING NEW HOME AS L.A. SHUTS UNSAFE MOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
CONDEMNED: BUILDING INSPECTORS HAVE DECLARED CRIME-RIDDEN PACOIMA STRUCTURE 
UNSAFE. SOME OF ITS LONGTIME RESIDENTS SAY THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

An old and dilapidated Pacoima motel, which police and residents said had 
become a haven for drug dealers and prostitutes in recent months, will be 
boarded up and closed Monday morning, displacing several poor families. 
</P>
<P>
City building inspectors declared the 18-unit, court-style Olive Motel at 10867 
San Fernando Road unsafe Friday and ordered tenants to vacate the decaying 
cabins and duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector Robert Cantu taped a sign on each unit declaring it a misdemeanor to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do," tenant Maria Rutilia Estrada said 
Saturday. "I have no money. I have no work." 
</P>
<P>
Her neighbor, Hemilia Valera, said she and her five children cannot move out by 
the 8:30 a.m. Monday deadline because her husband is working in Canada and she 
has no way to communicate with him. "How will he be able to find us?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police welcomed the news that the motel will be closed, saying the 
complex had become a center for criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of drugs, prostitution, drinking, you name it," said Sgt. Bill 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a resident of the complex since 1971, said it once had been a nice 
place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"No more," she said, gesturing toward several people gathered in the rear of 
the complex, laughing, drinking and smoking. "Now, there are many prostitutes 
and drug dealers here. Still, I have no place else to go." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who speaks no English, lives at the motel with three grandchildren, a 
daughter and her husband. She said she learned that she had to leave when owner 
David Reza visited her Saturday to tell her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so worried. I can't eat. I can't sleep," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Matilda Vega, who managed the complex from 1970 until 1984, said the motel was 
once clean and landscaped. She returned to the complex Saturday to offer 
Estrada and her family temporary shelter in her Panorama City home. 
</P>
<P>
"You can put your things in storage," Vega told her friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no money," Estrada repeated, adding that she was concerned that her 
furniture and personal belongings would be boarded up inside the condemned 
cabin because she had no place else to put them. 
</P>
<P>
Vega said the complex had been all but takenover by drug dealers and 
prostitutes in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the families moved out," she said. "There maybe are eight or nine of 
them left." 
</P>
<P>
Reza could not be reached, but an employee at his Simi Valley furniture store 
said his boss has offered to help Estrada and other tenants relocate their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of vagrants there," said the employee, who would not give his 
name. He said Reza had sold the complex in 1988 but was forced to foreclose on 
it last year after the buyer failed to make payments. Reza had wanted to tear 
the complex down for several months, the employee said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, Rod Daniels of Granada Hills, also visited the motel Saturday. "I 
was concerned about some of the tenants," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he learned after he bought the complex in November, 1988, that 
some of its units were havens for drug dealers and prostitutes. He said he 
stopped making payments on the motel, which he had intended to renovate, after 
he discovered that the property had been cited for building code violations 
before he purchased it. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the city Homeless Project will be present Monday to provide 
temporary shelter and aid for tenants who have not found new housing, project 
officials said.

MICHIGAN RESIDENTS IN SHOCK OVER SLAIN TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan legislator Francis Spaniola said Friday the capital community of 
Lansing, where 18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr appeared frequently on the stages 
of local theaters, has been devastated by her stabbing death this week at an 
apartment complex in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of tough people who walk the halls of the Legislature here, but 
I've never seen such an outpouring of kindness and concern," said Spaniola, a 
close friend of Paul Tarr, Holly's father. 
</P>
<P>
Spaniola said he met the senior Tarr when he flew in from San Diego late 
Thursday night on the same plane that returned his daughter's body to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Spaniola said the death of the aspiring actress -- the third young woman to 
have been stabbed to death in a two-block area since Jan. 12 -- has been widely 
reported in the news media in both Lansing and Detroit. Tarr, whose parents are 
divorced, lived with her mother in nearby Okemos, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"At the high school, where Holly was a senior, the students are in total 
shock," Spaniola said. "The theater community, in which she and her father and 
older sister have been active for years, is in total shock. Everyone has been 
deeply touched and is trying to show, in any way possible, their concern." 
</P>
<P>
Spaniola and Frank DeWald, Tarr's choral instructor at Okemos High School, said 
family members and friends are concerned about the emotional state of 
18-year-old Tammy Ho. She's described as Holly Tarr's best friend, whom DeWald 
said had lived with Tarr and her mother for 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ho accompanied Tarr on the spring-break vacation to San Diego to visit Tarr's 
brother Richard, an engineer in the space systems division of General Dynamics. 
Ho, a senior at Okemos High School, was with Tarr at the Buena Vista Gardens 
pool around noon Tuesday when Tarr left, by herself, authorities said, and 
returned to her brother's apartment for reasons that are still unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Elizabeth Langworthy, an 84-year-old neighbor of Richard 
Tarr's, reported seeing Holly and a man walk to the upstairs apartment. 
Langworthy has told police that about 20 minutes later she heard a scream. She 
said Ho showed up and tried to enter the apartment, which was locked. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Williams, a 58-year-old maintenance man, was summoned to the unit at 
3410 Cowley Way, and confronted a young black man who wore a red T-shirt and 
black Levi's, who came toward him with a knife. Witnesses have reported seeing 
the suspect drive away in a gray, "primer-paint-colored" Pinto. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the probable murder weapon, a knife 8 to 9 inches long, was found 
near the scene by a 15-year-old boy walking home from school Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen calls the search for the suspect, thought 
to be 18 to 20 years old and about 5-foot-8, the department's "top priority." 
Burgreen has assigned two homicide units to the case full time and has 
stationed a mobile command unit in the Buena Vista Gardens neighborhood. In 
all, there are about 20 officers investigating the slayings, with several more 
officers working part time on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Paige Schultz was killed at the adjacent Canyon Ridge complex on Jan. 
12. On Feb. 16, 21-year-old Janene Marie Weinhold was slain two blocks away, in 
a Buena Vista Gardens unit at 3301 Clairemont Drive. 
</P>
<P>
After Tarr's slaying Tuesday, police conceded for the first time that a serial 
killer may be responsible for all three killings. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz's fiance, who is white, was arrested shortly after her death and held 
for five days in County Jail. He was released when the district attorney failed 
to issue a murder complaint. He has not been rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Anza Management Co., which oversees both Canyon Ridge and Buena 
Vista Gardens, announced that the door locks on the 967 units of Buena Vista 
Gardens would be changed as soon as possible. A spokeswoman estimated the cost 
at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Because maintenance men and other employees of Buena Vista Gardens have 
passkeys to all of the units, the management has conceded it's possible that 
the suspect may have acquired a passkey. 
</P>
<P>
"Our passkey policy is being reviewed," said Suzanne Rosborough, the manager of 
Buena Vista Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Frank DeWald, choral instructor at the Michigan high school, said the school's 
"crisis team" is now "very concerned" about Tammy Ho, who not only lost her 
best friend but was questioned for hours by investigators as a key witness. 
</P>
<P>
"Tammy's mother moved out of the area over a year ago and wanted Tammy to 
remain in school," DeWald said. "So she moved in with Holly and her mom. She's 
not an actual family member, nor is she adopted, but she was like a sister to 
Holly. They were very, very close. And now we worry that she's very much at 
risk. She is, after all, at such a vulnerable age. It must have been very rough 
for Tammy. She saw Holly after she'd died and saw the perpetrator run from the 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
DeWald said that Tarr was in his select choir and orchestra and had sung a part 
of Brahms' requiem titled "How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place." He said that 
requiem will now be sung at her memorial service Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The service will feature 100 students in the orchestra (Tarr also played the 
violin), 70 students from the school choir and dozens more from the choir of 
University United Methodist Church, where Tarr was a member and where the 
service will be held, according to DeWald. 
</P>
<P>
Tarr's neighbor Langworthy said she had spoken on the phone with Paul Tarr, 
who, in reacting to the news of his daughter's death, asked her, "What kind of 
an awful city is it you have out there?" 
</P>
<P>
"But after we talked a while, he calmed down and just seemed very, very sad," 
Langworthy said. "I don't think he blames San Diego, although it is a horrible, 
horrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Quite honestly, I haven't seen anger among anyone in Michigan, Paul Tarr 
included," said Spaniola, who met the senior Tarr in the latter's role as a 
liaison between the Legislature and the state Department of Mental Health, 
where Tarr works. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul's done a lot of work with crippled children," Spaniola said. "He's a 
wonderful guy. I'd say most of what he's feeling is a profound sense of loss, 
for the daughter that won't be back."

Without the assurance of future water, Ventura County is dead for future 
business growth. The no-growth advocates have won -- hands down. 
</P>
<P>
Their wildest dreams are now realized. 
</P>
<P>
The news media are already smearing Santa Barbara across the front page of the 
Wall Street Journal, USA Today and now on CNN. USA Today's headline said, "The 
Central Coast Is Dried Up." That includes us. Public perception is everything, 
and the perception now is, "They are about to start drinking their bath water!" 
</P>
<P>
What savvy business would locate to an area with unstable water supplies? Or 
even visit? If your business is growing, or even if you're making future 
business growth plans -- plan to leave. Patagonia read its own "no-growth here" 
banner and expanded to Montana. And so should any other bright, ambitious 
entrepreneur in a no-growth business environment. 
</P>
<P>
We do have one immediate responsible alternative though. That is confronting 
the Ventura City Council and getting them to say "go" on the Water Quality 
Pipeline project to get state water. Without the water that the pipeline will 
bring, the economic future of Ventura County is bleak. 
</P>

Would the last business leaving, please turn out the light.

THREAT FROM DROUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
It has occurred to me that the water shortage is not the fault of the public's 
using too much water. I agree we should not use water unwisely during these 
times. 
</P>
<P>
My question to the city councils and the Board of Supervisors: Why do you let 
this happen? 
</P>
<P>
As elected officials, your job is not to cave in to builders, city or county 
staff, and investment groups that say in their EIRs that there is plenty of 
water for now and all times. From now on, the EIR should include, "What effect 
will the added use of water have on the residents of our area?" It should have 
statements from the water providers saying that there will be enough water. 
</P>
<P>
I call on all the people to call on their councilmen, local boards, planning 
commissioners and ask them why they allowed this to happen.

<P>
I would like to congratulate you on your new Ventura County section. I 
delivered The Times as a boy and have been a faithful reader since that time. 
</P>
<P>
Now I have one small request. Please expand your coverage of the Ventura City 
Council. This group bears watching, as I noted in your article "Vote Delayed on 
Ban of Big Boats in Yards." This ordinance was brought up without a public 
hearing, and when I called this morning, they had no plans for a public 
hearing. This affects me directly, as I just installed 90 feet of driveway and 
a 12-by-30-foot pad to store my boat in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The press is my only link to city government, and I can't emphasize how 
important that link can be.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Child Care 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 265 to 145, the House sent to conference with the Senate a bill 
(HR 3) expanding federal programs to help parents of limited means obtain day 
care for their children, at a cost of $27 billion over five years. More than 
half of the cost derives from earned income tax credits for families earning up 
to $20,270 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The bill funds school-based programs for "latchkey" children, as well as state 
efforts to upgrade the safety and quality of supervision at child-care centers 
in public, private and religious settings. It turns Head Start into an all-day 
occupation for preschoolers. And it provides states with block grants, to be 
spent mainly on operating expenses of child-care centers and vouchers that 
parents would use to secure child care. Vouchers could be spent for 
church-sponsored care. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

GOP Substitute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 195 to 225, the House rejected a Republican child-care substitute 
that was backed by the White House. Its cost of $20 billion was about $7 
billion less than that of the Democratic bill (above). Another key difference 
was that it gave states more leeway in setting child-care standards. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said that with the Democratic bill "we are 
sticking our noses so far into the affairs of states, it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Michael A. Andrews (D-Tex.) said Congress sets standards "for 
airlines, for nursing homes, even for animals." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP substitute.

New Cabinet Department 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 161 to 266, the House rejected a White House-backed amendment 
limiting the scope of a new Cabinet-level Department of Environmental 
Protection. The House then sent the bill (HR 3847) to the Senate by a wide 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment sought to kill language subjecting federal polluters to the same 
hazardous waste laws that apply to private firms. It also attempted to put 
under White House control a new bureau set up to increase public access to data 
on pollution, and to eliminate other areas where the Cabinet department would 
wield more power than the EPA now has. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to limit the scope of the new department.

RACE FOR CARSON TREASURER STIRS UP POLITICAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election of a treasurer in Carson, which once offered a respite from the 
city's political wars, this year is a pitched battle. 
</P>
<P>
Two-term incumbent Mary Custer has attracted the enmity of Mayor Michael Mitoma 
and Councilman John Anderson, who have backed her opponent Jaime (Jim) 
Punsalan. Custer has the endorsement of Councilwomen Kay Calas and Vera Robles 
DeWitt, who make up a two-member minority faction on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Punsalan, 52, a deputy Los Angeles County assessor who is seeking office for 
the first time, said last week that Custer has bungled the investment of the 
city's cash and that it is time for the city to have a professional in the 
treasurer's job. 
</P>
<P>
Custer, 59, has questioned Punsalan's standing as a certified public accountant 
and his long-term commitment to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Custer said last week that she should be elected to another four-year-term on 
Tuesday because she has invested the city's $70-million portfolio wisely. She 
said Mitoma is trying to put into the treasurer's office "a rubber stamp . . . 
so he can funnel the city's investment to his favorite banks." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma denied that he wants a treasurer who will do his bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mary (Custer) said that, she doesn't deserve to be in office because she is 
lying," he said. Anderson, who lashed out at Custer during a council meeting 
March 20, has said he is endorsing Punsalan as the more qualified candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Punsalan said in an interview that he agreed to assist Anderson's reelection 
campaign in return for an endorsement by Mitoma and Anderson, but Mitoma denied 
that he or Anderson sought anything in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did ask Punsalan to provide the list of applicants for absentee 
ballots that Punsalan's campaign had gathered, but Punsalan "was not able to 
provide that list. He needs us. We don't need him." 
</P>
<P>
One of Punsalan's chief arguments against Custer is that he is a CPA and she is 
not. "We need a professional, not a politician," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In a full-page ad in a recent issue of the Carson News, Punsalan said Custer 
had invested city funds in a bank at 9% interest on Dec. 19, when another bank 
was willing to pay a higher rate. The ad did not identify the bank or the rate 
it was offering. 
</P>
<P>
Custer said the claim is false. She said she made a number of investments that 
day at rates ranging from 8.0% to 8.5% and that no bank was offering rates of 
9% or higher on that date. She added that her investment policy is designed for 
safety, liquidity and yield, with priorities in that order. In the last fiscal 
year, she said the city earned $6 million on its $70-million investment 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an excellent rate." she said. "Other cities have lost money -- we are 
talking of millions of dollars -- making unwise investments. Carson has not 
lost one dollar since I have been treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
In criticizing Punsalan's status as a professional accountant, she pointed out 
that he had let his status as a certified public accountant lapse in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Punsalan conceded that he had not paid his state fee in 1988 and that his 
license had been revoked for delinquency from Feb. 1, 1988, until May, 1989, 
when he belatedly paid. "I did not receive the billing until 1989," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, state officials mailed back his check and renewal form because it 
arrived incomplete, and the state Board of Accountancy listed him as delinquent 
as of Feb. 1, according to a state official. He mailed back the form properly 
filled out, and on March 12 state officials returned his license to active 
status, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Custer, a 26-year resident of Carson, has questioned Punsalan's long-term 
commitment to the city. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Punsalan said, he moved from a house he owns in Rancho Palos Verdes to 
a room in his in-laws' house in Carson, in order to get involved in Carson 
politics. His wife stays with him from time to time in Carson, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Punsalan said he lived in Carson for several years beginning in 1976, moved to 
Long Beach for several years, then moved back to Carson in the early 1980s. He 
bought the Rancho Palos Verdes house in the mid-1980s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Punsalan said he is campaigning with $20,000 of his own money and has not 
raised funds from any other sources. Custer has raised about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
The position of treasurer, which pays $53,640 a year, has a lower salary than 
any of the city's appointed department heads, who make at least $13,000 a year 
more.

THE MASTERS IS A MONUMENT TO GOLF, NOT THE DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>

<P>
AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Professional sports, fed by the demeaning demands of its insatiable interest in 
turning a dollar, has sold everything, including its character. There's little 
dignity, or even decency, to be found anymore . . . except at an enclave known 
as the Augusta National Golf Club, home of the revered Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's no objection to any promoter making a profit but not at the expense 
of the public. The Masters stands alone in demonstrating a remarkable 
consideration for its patrons. Its standing philosophy is being reiterated by 
Hord Hardin, the tournament chairman. 
</P>
<P>
There's no carnival atmosphere at the Masters. It's the only sports event in 
America where they refuse to sell hot dogs, where a blimp isn't permitted to 
fly overhead advertising tires or where they don't allow corporate hospitality 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
The Augusta National Golf Club, host to the Masters, doesn't even have a 
publicity director. A staff of men and women handle press reservations but not 
a PR person per se. Obviously, the Masters carries itself and doesn't need to 
patronize the media. 
</P>
<P>
About the hot dogs. Clifford Roberts, one of the founding fathers of the 
Masters, along with the immortal Bobby Jones, objected to the smell of cooking 
odors permeating the fairways. To Roberts, this was unpleasant, unsavory. 
</P>
<P>
A barbecue sandwich, but no hot dogs or hamburgers. In fact, the concession 
stand menu is among the most reasonable. Here's your chance to check the 
prices: 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiches: Pimento cheese, $1; Egg salad, $1; ham on rye, $1.25; ham and 
cheese on rye, $1.50; turkey, $1.50; barbecue, $1.50; club, $2. 
</P>
<P>
Beverages: milk, 50 cents; soda (14 ounces) 75 cents; domestic beer, $1.25; 
imported beer, $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
Candy, potato chips and crackers, 50 cents; cigars, 25 and 50 cents; aspirin, 
$1.25; Rolaids, 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, there's no charge for parking on the lots adjacent to the course. 
Pairing sheets are distributed free and check stands, where you can leave 
coats, umbrellas, etc., operate as a courtesy to those in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
A ticket for the four-day tournament is one price -- $90 -- which means on a 
pro-rated basis it is more affordable than attending any other sports classic. 
The popularity of the Masters and the way they do things at Augusta National is 
the envy of those who stage football, baseball, hockey and all the other games 
that are played for money. 
</P>
<P>
"All we want to do is make enough to run this tournament in a fit and proper 
way," Hardin said. "There was one time, about 10 years ago, when it went in the 
red. We didn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Masters disciplines the sale of tickets so the gallery traffic is kept 
under control. It is virtually impossible to gain admission if you haven't been 
a yearly subscriber. There's a waiting list but it was growing so large it was 
stopped in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 5,000 on it and we were constantly getting letters from those who 
wanted to buy," Hardin said. "People also were writing to ask where they were 
on the list and if their position had improved. So we just stopped taking 
requests." 
</P>
<P>
What about those still in waiting, going back over 20 years? Have they moved up 
at all? "Just a limited number of notches because we don't have cancellations." 
Then Hardin thought of an analogy to fit the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way. We do it very carefully, like the old story about how do 
porcupines make love. The answer is 'very carefully.' " 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, a bus delivered an assemblage of Japanese businessmen to the 
Masters. They were being entertained by a group of U.S. corporate leaders 
interested in establishing trading ties. "Not to pick on the Japanese or anyone 
else but they weren't on our list," Hardin said. "They had to get the tickets 
from some place. We checked the numbers and those responsible in using the 
tickets that way never got them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to television time, Hardin is aware of how important it is to 
allow the rest of America, and a large part of the world, to see it. But even 
then the Masters holds a heavy driver, so to speak, over the head of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"We restrict the station breaks and commercials to four minutes every hour," 
Hardin said. "On other telecasts it's 13 minutes out of every 60. Our idea is 
for TV to contribute to the advancement of golf." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the veteran players, led by Arnold Palmer, want the Masters to 
establish a senior division for players over 50. Again, Hardin holds his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to run two competitions. It would water down the Masters," he 
said. "Why, doing that would be just like having flights in a country club 
tournament. Five years from now, maybe, because I don't want to close the door 
and we like to believe we are reasonable when good suggestions are presented. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I believe would happen is the older golfers would want to move up to 
hit from a different set of tees. And then the next thing you know they would 
be wanting to ride carts. It just makes no sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
How does one go about joining Augusta National? There's no stated policy, 
except you must be invited. You can't apply. The membership at present is 295 
and holding. Dues are not disclosed but a longtime member said they were 
reasonable and not considered expensive when compared to most golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
What Augusta National has built is a monument to golf. It fights to protect its 
turf in a crass sports world, where class is passe and too often abuses the 
public. For that alone it deserves respect, admiration and applause. 
</P>

THE LAST AT-BAT FOR CHICAGO'S COMISKEY PARK

It's the last turn at bat for old Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
After 80 years, the senior ballpark in the majors is closing for good at the 
end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the season will be special," said Manager Jeff Torborg, whose Chicago 
White Sox move across 35th Street to a brand new, $150 million Comiskey Park 
for opening day 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The place called home by such stars as "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, Minnie Minoso, 
Luke Appling, Harold Baines and Carlton Fisk is targeted for the wrecker's ball 
to make room for a parking lot or shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Comiskey's last season kicks off Monday with the Sox scheduled to play host to 
the Milwaukee Brewers. Chicago shortstop Ozzie Guillen says he will miss the 
old park, but it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my first big-league ballpark. You're never going to forget your first 
big-league ballpark. I really like it, but it's time to get a new one,' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When opened on July 1, 1910, it was billed the "Baseball Palace of the World." 
</P>
<P>
Built for and named after White Sox founder Charles Comiskey, the park had 
upper decks from first to third base, with two detached grandstands in right 
and left. It cost $1 million to construct and it seated 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball had never seen anything like it before. It was only the third concrete 
and steel stadium built in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A downtown parade and gala South Side celebrations marked the opener, which the 
home team lost 2-0 to the St. Louis Browns before a packed house. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 80 years, the park would see the good, the bad, the ugly and the 
worst scandal in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
Comiskey, who had changed the name of his franchise from the White Stockings, 
moved the team from a 7,500-seat, wooden park at 39th and Wentworth, and built 
the Sox into a formidable club. 
</P>
<P>
They beat the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series, their last world crown. 
</P>
<P>
After Chicago lost the 1919 Series to the Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked 
by Black Sox Scandal. Eight Sox players were banned from the game for life for 
their part in a gamblers' conspiracy to fix the Series. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Comiskey Park where a small boy came up to Jackson and said, "It 
ain't true, Joe" according to the recent book on the scandal, "Eight Men Out," 
by Eliot Asinof. 
</P>
<P>
Many would prefer to remember the kid insisting, "Say, it ain't so, Joe?" 
</P>
<P>
It would be 1959 before the White Sox got into another Series. This time the 
"Go, Go" Sox of Minoso and Nellie Fox went, and lost to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Comiskey Park was the site of the first All-Star Game, which returned 
to the South Side stadium on the event's 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Night games started there in 1939, almost half a century before the North Side 
Cubs got lights for Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
The American League color barrier was broken at Comiskey when black outfielder 
Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians came to bat as a pinch-hitter on July 5, 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, colorful Sox owner Bill Veeck had built beyond the center-field 
bleachers the world's first "exploding scoreboard," with a display of smoke and 
rockets after each Sox homer. 
</P>
<P>
Veeck also was king of the promotion and give-away. Comiskey Park fans have 
received bats, jerseys, tiny clocks, Bermuda shorts, sunglasses and S&amp;H 
savings stamps. They've sat through donkey baseball, cow milking and beer case 
stacking contests. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 Veeck was gone and the stadium's name was changed to White Sox Park. 
The American League's first artificial surface was installed. 
</P>
<P>
But Veeck was back in 1976, rescuing the franchise from a move to Seattle, and 
he returned grass and the name, Comiskey, to the park. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl staged a Disco Demolition Night 
between games of a doubleheader. Rioting anti-disco fans did so much damage 
that the Sox had to forfeit the second game. 
</P>
<P>
It was yet another world's first for the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
The club won the AL West in 1983. But by the end of the decade, the team had 
fallen on hard times and so had the ballpark. The owners threatened to move the 
White Sox to Florida unless a publicly owned stadium was built for the team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the melodrama over Illinois possibly losing the lucrative franchise 
lasted months until fans protested and Gov. James R. Thompson intervened. He 
lent his support to state legislation that resulted in the new 43,000-seat, 
open-air Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The old park, with seating for 43,951 this season, also was home to the Chicago 
Cardinals football team off and on from 1922 until 1958, but it gained its fame 
as the longtime home of the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The players still argue over whether Comiskey favored hitters or pitchers, but 
utilityman Steve Lyons insists there's really no argument. 
</P>
<P>
"The grass is slow, the winds is blowing in all the time, and you have to hit 
it a ton to get it out of there," said Lyons, who batted .217 at home and .305 
on the road last season. "It's a pitcher's ballpark and I'm not a pitcher."

ZIMMER AND FREY: QUITE A TEAM ON QUITE A TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LITKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Frey walked unannounced into the office of boyhood chum Don Zimmer and 
unceremoniously handed him a single sheet of white paper with three typewritten 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 30 seconds, Zimmer's eyes scanned right to left, right to left, 
right to left. The manager of the defending NL East champions lifted his right 
hand and made a pass through the graying stubble he still thinks of as a 
haircut. He reached across the red-and-blue Chicago Cubs insignia covering the 
left side of his chest and scratched his ribs, just below the armpit. Finally, 
he looked up and rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Thought so," Frey said, balling up the sheet of paper and zipping it toward 
the wastebasket to Zimmer's right. "Everybody wants too much." 
</P>
<P>
And so the lives of at least two, but likely several more, professional 
baseball players remained undisturbed, at least for the moment. Frey turned on 
his heels and headed for the exit. He slowed at the doorway, but did not turn 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a minute had elapsed at this point. When Frey spoke, he didn't 
appear to be talking to anyone in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have talked to you if I thought there was anything more to talk 
about," he said. "I will if there is." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer was by then looking down at his desk and the back of his hands. A month 
earlier, he turned 59 and he has known Frey for almost 50 of those years. He 
called after his just-departed friend: "You do that." 
</P>
<P>
That was two weeks ago. In many of the half-dozen spring-training camps no more 
than a long foul ball away (and many more such facilities in Florida), 
computers were whirring and clicking, whirring and clicking big-time, as 
baseball managers and a cadre of assistants plotted the course for 1990 and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Working on a compressed schedule and a dizzying series of printouts, they 
assessed the talent they have, the talent they coveted, and the talent they 
will have to face in the season that is now -- finally, mercifully -- just five 
days away. 
</P>
<P>
At Mesa, Ariz., in a spartan office that holds a gun-metal gray desk and 
locker, a burnt-orange sofa and yellowing kitchen chair and a blackboard, field 
manager Zimmer and general manager Frey were preparing for the '90s as well. 
</P>
<P>
Watching them do it, though, made it seem more like the 1890s. Both are short 
and a little round, neither looked like a ballplayer when they first teamed up 
at Western Hills High in Cincinnati, and yet they have a combined eight decades 
in the game between them. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't take enough meetings, and a dearth of charts and graphs means 
baseball is passing them by, neither one knows it. What they do know is what 
they are looking for -- head and heart and hard work -- and they are confident 
they will know it when they see it. And both of them will know it at once. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer made his professional playing debut in the Dodgers' system in 1949, 
seeming even then like something of a throwback. And through most of his tries 
at running a ballclub, he managed like one. It often appeared he called for 
pitchouts or the hit-and-run only because he felt like it, and he filled out 
the lineup card depending how it felt when he plopped down on the bench and the 
seat of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
Equally worrisome, he blew up at players he thought were dogging it, and, in 
sometimes-fractured English, threatened them with bus trips back to the minors. 
And he continued to do so long after guaranteed contracts made the threats 
irrelevant and planes were servicing most Triple-A markets. 
</P>
<P>
Frey, on the other hand, was the polished one. The one who went to college 
before signing a baseball contract, the one who stayed in chemistry class after 
his friend transferred into shop class and began making lamps. 
</P>
<P>
And when he took over as general manager of the Chicago Cubs in 1987, and 
brought Zimmer into the organization the next year, charges of cronyism were 
rampant. Zimmer hadn't been entrusted to manage a club since 1982 and at the 
time, most teams were hiring younger men who knew their way around software. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Zimmer likely thinks the word has something to do with clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those computer printouts are a great crutch," Frey told Sports 
Illustrated in an interview late last season. "Seventy-five percent of them are 
nonsense. What are you going to do when you go to the mound in the eighth 
inning and see that your pitcher is quivering when he talks to you? Look at the 
computer? You need a guy who knows the game at this level; who has seen it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the dynamic duo pushed and pulled a team of two dozen ballplayers 
generally regarded as too young and too thin in the pitching department to a 
division title. They did it because Zimmer's zany gambles came up right more 
often than Bat Masterson, and because he coaxed career years from both the kids 
he inherited -- Greg Maddux, Jerome Walton and Dwight Smith -- as well as the 
retreads -- Mike Bielecki, Lloyd McClendon and Domingo Ramos -- that Frey found 
in other clubs' scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
And they mean to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the Cubs are, again, without a proven left-handed starter in a 
rotation that works half its games in windswept Wrigley Field, or that 
outfielder Andre Dawson's knee and catcher Damon Berryhill's shoulder are 
recovering way behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Even the uncertain future of pitching mainstay Rick Sutcliffe, sent back to 
Chicago for X-rays after a chronic shoulder problem flared up anew Tuesday, 
seems not to have shaken either man's faith. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Sutcliffe's 229 innings and 16 wins "is not a small order,' Frey 
said, "so I'm concerned about it. We'll try to do the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing really to do is to give the ball to some young guy," he added, 
"and hope the same thing happens that happened last year." 
</P>
<P>
But just in case it doesn't, it's a safe bet some contingency plans are already 
in place. Indeed, a phone call some 20 minutes after the brief meeting in 
Zimmer's office two weeks ago suggested that balled-up piece of paper would not 
be the only one to find it's way into the wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Zimmer answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah . . . Yeah . . . Right . . . Right. . . . Look into it." 
</P>
<P>
The other party never was identified, but it had to be Frey, if only because of 
the swiftness with which information was being relayed. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. . . . Absolutely. . . . Fine with me," Zimmer concluded, "too."

WILL SURPRISES OF 1989 HELP OUT ORIOLES AGAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can find them in every corner of the Baltimore Orioles' lineup this spring. 
They make up more than half of the infield, three-fifths of the probable 
starting rotation, the top spot in the bullpen, two-thirds of what appears to 
be the Opening Day outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, they were among the biggest surprises in the major leagues a year 
ago, a group of young players, mostly rookies, who helped transform the Orioles 
from a joke into a contender: Gregg Olson, Mickey Tettleton, Jeff Ballard, Dave 
Johnson, Bob Milacki, Randy Milligan, Craig Worthington, Mike Devereaux, Steve 
Finley, Pete Harnisch. 
</P>
<P>
All but Tettleton and Ballard are essentially sophomore major-leaguers this 
year, and all, including Tettleton and Ballard, are at approximately the same 
station in their careers: They have had their first real success in the majors 
(some more than others), and now it is time to see if they are a) for real, or 
b) one-season wonders. 
</P>
<P>
No team in baseball is relying so heavily on players who, though successful as 
fledgling major-leaguers, have yet to prove long-haul consistency. Thus, even 
though they are coming off a season in which they almost won the American 
League East, the Orioles are a team of questions as the 1990 season begins. 
</P>
<P>
Can Tettleton hit 26 homers again? Can Olson convert 27 of 33 save 
opportunities? Is Ballard really an 18-game winner? Can Worthington drive in 
even more runs? Can Devereaux be the everyday center fielder? Can Milligan be 
the everyday first baseman? Can Milacki throw 243 innings again? Can Harnisch 
settle down and win? Does Johnson have more magic? Is Finley ready to produce? 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' season will turn on the answers to these questions. There are 
three possible scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They all come through. If it happens, the Orioles are certifiably deep in 
young talent and should be contenders not only this year, but also for many to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 -- None comes through. Disaster strikes. The Orioles turn back into Zer-Os. 
"If there's such a thing as the sophomore jinx, we're going to have a terrible 
year," Manager Frank Robinson said. (FYI: He was kidding. He doesn't think 
there is.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some come through and some don't. 
</P>
<P>
The last scenario is the most likely simply because of the mathematics 
involved. How likely is it that every one of these players duplicates or 
betters his 1989 performance? And how likely is it that they all crater? Not 
likely either way. We're talking about 10 players here. That's a lot. The world 
just isn't that perfect, or that terrible. 
</P>
<P>
Statistical chance suggests that, even in a good year, one or two or more won't 
cut it. Injuries. Nerves. Something will happen. Similarly, one or two or more 
should come through even in a bad year. There is just too much talent spread 
among these players for there to be a collective flop. 
</P>
<P>
So, who is going to come through, and who isn't? Do I look like the Amazing 
Kreskin? Obviously, there is no way of knowing right now. The front office 
believes in them all -- otherwise they wouldn't figure so prominently in the 
blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
Finley and Harnisch concern the team the most right now, which is 
understandable considering that they proved the least in 1989. Harnisch was 
inconsistent as a starting pitcher, finishing 5-9, and has been shaky this 
spring. Finley was injured a lot last year and had little chance to do much. He 
has been handed right field this spring because of his fielding, but he isn't 
hitting, and he's pressing. 
</P>
<P>
Who, on the other hand, is the most likely to succeed? My vote is for Olson. 
It's hard to envision him struggling; he's too tough. One thing is certain: All 
10 of them will have to raise their games this year. Robinson is right in that 
there isn't such a thing as a sophomore jinx -- his batting average went up 32 
points in his second year -- but there are factors to consider. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in a player's second season is that the other teams have made 
adjustments, and it's up to the player to react," Robinson said. "The other 
teams have had all winter to figure out how to pitch to the hitters who have 
hurt them, or how to attack certain pitchers who have done well against them. A 
player in his second year might see a lot of different things from what he saw 
as a rookie. It doesn't have to be difficult, but it can be." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. It is an important test for players coming off a season in which they 
had their first real success. Some just don't make it. The Orioles know all 
about that. Mike Young hit 28 homers in 1985 and never approached that form 
again. Larry Sheets hit 31 homers in 1987, and 17 the next two seasons 
combined. Pitchers learned how to get them out. 
</P>
<P>
It is a frightening thought. Among the current Orioles, there are different 
reactions to the subject of the sophomore jinx. Devereaux screwed up his nose 
at the very mention of the words, as if they were a curse. But Olson was so 
intrigued he sought out Robinson as soon as the lockout was over and camps 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the sophomore jinx?" he asked Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Adjustments, nothing but that," Robinson said. "Pitchers adjusting to hitters. 
Hitters adjusting to pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
"So, what do I have to do?" Olson asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," Robinson said, "You don't have to do anything. Until you have to."

HUNTING FOR REVERSE OF VIRGINIA BLUE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANGUS PHILLIPS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The folks at Virginia's Wildlife Violation Hotline have answered some unusual 
calls in their time, but they'd never before handled a complaint quite like Joe 
Ficarro's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to report a hunting violation," said the 40-year-old Virginia Beach 
taxidermist when he rang up in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, when and where did the violation occur?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow," said Ficarro, "in Pungo." 
</P>
<P>
Ficarro explained that he'd be the violator and wanted to make sure a game 
warden was around to catch him hunting on Sunday. He even solicited advice, to 
be sure he clearly broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
When Warden Craig Thomas met him at the appointed hour, Ficarro hauled out a 
$14 single-shot clunker of a shotgun, just in case it was confiscated as 
evidence. "They weren't going to get my Browning," he said. Then he loaded it 
with birdshot and stepped afield, ostensibly to hunt quail. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the warden I hoped I didn't have to actually shoot one, because we 
might be there awhile," chuckled Ficarro, a deer hunter who claims no expertise 
with birds. "But he said all I had to do was walk around with the gun." 
</P>
<P>
Ficarro did, and got the ticket he came for, thereby entering a fray he hopes 
will change the law of the state. 
</P>
<P>
When he enters Virginia Beach District Criminal Court on April 25, it will be 
to challenge the constitutionality of a law he says unfairly denies him the 
right to do as he pleases on his day off. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go to tractor pulls on Sunday," he said. "You can shop at the mall. 
You can shoot skeet, go to a football game, buy beer. But I'm stuck at home, 
watching all-star 'rassling on TV. It burns me up." 
</P>
<P>
The perceived injustice of Virginia's traditional Sunday hunting prohibition 
has bugged Ficarro for years. He works six days a week, he said, with Saturday 
his busiest day in the shop. But when he finally gets a day off, he has to do 
as others tell him in keeping with anachronistic, Bible Belt blue laws, as he 
sees it. 
</P>
<P>
He was bemoaning that fact at his weekly card game last winter when his cronies 
suggested they do something about it. Their research showed several legislative 
bills aimed at opening Sunday hunting in Virginia, one of 11 states that 
prohibit it. All had failed. 
</P>
<P>
Ficarro called the sponsor of the most recent one, Sen. Madison Marye, D, who 
said the chance of getting a bill through the General Assembly was nil and he 
wasn't planning to try again. 
</P>
<P>
That left one avenue, said Ficarro's attorney and card-playing partner, Gary 
Byler. "He told us, 'Someone's got to break the law and test it in court,' " 
said Ficarro. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Who would be stupid enough to do that?' and when I turned around, 
everyone was looking at me." 
</P>
<P>
The rest is civil-disobedience history, and Ficarro is turning into something 
of a local figure because of it. "The day this thing hit the papers I was like 
Donald Trump's lawyer," he said. "The phone rang off the hook. People wanted to 
know, 'What can I do to help?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ficarro and Byler figure the case is likely to go to several levels of appeal, 
so they established the non-profit Virginia Sportman's Association for Sunday 
Hunting Inc., to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already got $1,400 and that's just the tip of the iceberg," said 
Ficarro. "We're selling $7 hats for $25, which is a better deal than the 
televangelists give. At least you get a hat." 
</P>
<P>
But for all the joking, Ficarro believes he's onto a serious issue. Virginia's 
blue laws against commerce and recreation on Sundays, like those in many 
states, have been eased in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Some states also have removed or eased Sunday hunting prohibitions, according 
to the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America, an Ohio-based hunters'-rights 
organization that reports 34 states have no ban on Sunday hunting. 
</P>
<P>
But prohibitions remain firmly in place in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, 
Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina, as well as Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Ficarro surrounded by places that won't let him hunt on his day 
off, even though he's been assured by Virginia's Game Division chief, James 
Remington, among others, that there's no biological need for Sunday closures. 
</P>
<P>
Ficarro said the sentiment against Sunday hunting comes from churches, which 
want folks in the pews, and from some farmers who want a day of rest with no 
one tramping around their fields. 
</P>
<P>
He recognizes those constituencies, he said, and appreciates their concerns. 
"There's no bad guys in this dispute," he said. "But our country and our state 
were founded on principles of freedom to do what you like, as long as it 
doesn't infringe on someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Byler said: "We believe Sunday hunting is outlawed because it's the day most 
people who go to church choose to worship. We all know that's why the day was 
picked. We feel that picking a day for religious reasons is an unconstitutional 
mix of church and state." 
</P>
<P>
Byler reckons it will be an uphill fight to change the law. "Judges at this 
level are always reluctant to strike down a state statute as opposed to a city 
statute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes a protracted court case will force the Virginia legislature to 
readdress the issue and change the law voluntarily, so Ficarro doesn't have to 
take it all the way to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, however, it's clear Ficarro has opened a can of worms, 
which is a bold move for a taxidermist.

On the field, the play is very much big league: Fastballs that hum in at 90 
plus mph and double plays turned as smoothly as the swings of the guys with the 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Javier Mendez uncoil from his slight crouch and belt one over the sign 
advertising Fidel Castro's next big speech. Like Cuba's politics, Mendez swings 
from the left. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like he would feel at home in almost any big league lineup. Off the 
field, though, U.S. and Cuban baseball are as different as the two countries' 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as an "owner" in the George Steinbrenner sense. All 
enterprises in Cuba belong to the state, including baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are there "player demands" in Cuba. These fellows, some of them world class 
players, have to settle for their 100 pesos or so a month, no questions asked. 
Collective bargaining? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba-born Jose Canseco, who left the island as an infant, makes about as much 
playing for the Oakland A's in a single inning (over $1,000) as the average 
Cuban player makes in a year and that's no typo. 
</P>
<P>
There's no army of people needed here to handle finances. Admission is free and 
there are no advertising revenues. (Castro gets to put up his sign for free. He 
has other ballpark signs as well: "Socialism or Death" and "Ready to Conquer.") 
</P>
<P>
By U.S. standards, Cuban players endure extraordinary hardships. All travel is 
done by bus on this 800-mile wide island. Because of the U.S. embargo, 
American-made aluminum bats, the kind Cubans prefer, are in short supply. Some 
players are forced to use a bat size not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
Several teams, including Havana, live in barracks-like structures. Even during 
homestands, the players get to go home to their government-provided apartments 
only on the days always set aside for open dates, Mondays and Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
If a player is a student during the off-season, his salary could be as low as 
50 pesos a month. At the official exchange rate, that's only about $45. Kirby 
Puckett spills that much before breakfast. Can you imagine Orel Hershiser 
toiling away for $45 a month? 
</P>
<P>
If a player works as a 150-peso a-month laborer during the off season, he makes 
the same salary when he's playing ball. If he averages three homers and 10 
RBI's a game, it makes no difference: 150 pesos a month, end discussion. 
</P>
<P>
But with housing, food and transportation provided for, the players don't 
complain, at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rich but we have our needs resolved," says Juan Padilla, a whiz 
around second base for the Havana team. 
</P>
<P>
Ahh, Cuban baseball. Memories of Minnie Minoso, Pedro Ramos, Sandy Amoros, 
Camilo Pasqual, Tony Perez. The Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. 
In the last 22 world amateur baseball championships, Cuba has won 19 times, 
finished second once and third twice, according to Baseball Commissioner Manuel 
Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable baseball men figure 35 to 40 Cubans are of major league calibre. 
Cuban pitching appears to be mostly minor league level but it's not hard to 
envision Cubans at other positions, particularly infielders, dazzling crowds at 
Candlestick or Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his lavishly paid counterparts in the U.S. "ligas grandes," 
Mendez, 25, shrugs and says he sees no need for salaries in the million-plus 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when that kind of money corrupts," he says. Castro agrees, 
often lamenting that the U.S. is plagued by "irrational consumerism." Some 
people, he says, think they have to have "65 shirts." Wonder what he would say 
about major leaguers who buy Mercedes by the six-pack? 
</P>
<P>
Mendez is standing in the barracks where he and his mates from the Havana team 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The season is 23 games old and Mendez has been brutalizing opposing pitching, 
hitting a league-leading .392. He has six home runs and 19 RBI's. Injuries 
hampered his performance in previous seasons but no longer. It's about four 
hours before gametime, and most of the team is watching an afternoon soap opera 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
The trappings for the players evoke memories of boot camp: seven players to a 
room, no privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Servio Borges calls the place a "sporting motel." It is located in the 
heart of a sports complex south of the city. Much of the area is devoted to 
training athletic instructors. 
</P>
<P>
With a 17-6 record, Havana is leading the eight-team league in what is known as 
the "serie selectiva," the prestige tournament of the several Cuba holds each 
year. Many players compete virtually all 12 months. The "selectiva" is the 
competition Cuban fans wait for. The winner of the 63-game season gets to play 
abroad and earns bug-eyed adulation from their fans. With fewer players, the 
calibre of play is higher than the 18-team national competition held between 
November and January. 
</P>
<P>
Borges, 43, likes the idea of having his players live under one roof. Last 
year, they all lived at home and the team played poorly, so poorly that the 
local Communist Party chapter sat down with the team for a pep talk. (This 
happens to other teams as well.) 
</P>
<P>
Borges says discipline is better this year and the record shows it. Still, he's 
antsy. The pressures on him are no less than those faced by Tom Lasorda or Don 
Zimmer. There's not much to do in Cuba, so people watch baseball and root hard. 
Morales, the baseball commissioner, says 72% of Cuban televisions are regularly 
tuned in to a game. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a one-time pitching prospect before making a career switch, likes the 
Santiago team from Cuba's east end. He was raised nearby and, besides, that is 
the city where the revolution began. 
</P>
<P>
Borges feels he and his team are constantly under the microscope. The 
"Girardillos," as his team is called, finished in second place four years in a 
row and it's been 15 years since Havana has won the "selectiva." The fans are 
getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular evening, the team dines together on pork chops at the sports 
complex and then boards the bus for the half hour ride to Latin American 
Stadium. As usual, Borges is nervous. The bus takes off behind schedule and he 
won't have time for the pregame meeting. Borges insists his players are nervous 
as well but the horseplay on the bus leaves a different impression. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's opponent is Las Villas, a team from the central part of the country, 
and Havana is gunning for a three-game sweep. From the dressing room, the 
Havana team (known officially as Ciudad Habana) heads for the field, descending 
cement steps that have been chipped away by player spikes since 1946 when this 
relic, unsullied by artificial turf, was built. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium seats 60,000 (some other playing fields in the league hold only 
12,000) but there is a homey atmosphere, with many seats close to the action. 
It has a charm that some of the astroturfed U.S. ballfields lack. 
</P>
<P>
There are relatively few private cars in Cuba so most fans walk to the park or 
take the bus. Shortly before gametime, with about 25,000 people in the stadium, 
about a third of the parking lot -- there are only about 150 spaces -- is 
filled. For the fans, the nice part is walking in and sitting down free of 
charge. The choicest seats are reserved for families of the players and VIP's. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is relaxed. Here at least, the totalitarian police state 
ambience that American conservatives fret about is missing. Blacks predominate 
in the stands and on the playing field. Fans are expected to return foul balls 
hit into the stands. About 10 to 15 balls are used per game, well below the 
major league average. 
</P>
<P>
A strapping right-hander, Lazaro Valle, only 19, has been picked to start for 
the home team. Borges says he's one of the three best pitchers in the league. 
Control would be his biggest problem tonight. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Girardillos are having few problems solving the Las Villas 
starter, Roberto Almarales, a slim righty. The home team, clad in blue and 
white, gets to him early.

CS NORTHRIDGE CAN'T TAKE THE 5TH, FALLS TO POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For four innings Saturday, Cal State Northridge left-hander John Bushart did a 
fine impression of former major league pitcher Tommy John, the ground-ball 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart induced nine ground balls, forced two double plays and did not allow a 
hit to Cal Poly Pomona over the first four innings of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. game at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fifth, Bushart's routine fell apart. First he lost the no-hitter, 
then the shutout, and finally the game. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart was tagged for five hits and six earned runs in the fifth, as Pomona 
came back from a 3-0 deficit to defeat Northridge, 7-5, for the first time in 
five meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Matador Coach Bill Kernen demonstrated the patience of a fisherman as Pomona 
battered Bushart in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept thinking he was going to get the third out, but he didn't," Kernen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Keelin broke up the no-hitter with a leadoff single to left field, but 
Bushart retired the next two batters and appeared to be in control. Then Kurt 
Miltenberger lined a run-scoring single to left-center. Runs began pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Andrews followed with a walk and Jason Keeline laced a two-run double down 
the third-base line. Neil Weingarten singled in a run and Matt Bullock bounced 
a double off the wall for two more. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart (4-1) walked the next batter and saw him go to second on a wild pitch 
before Kernen finally yanked the freshman in favor of Todd Denhart. 
</P>
<P>
Denhart gave up a single that scored the sixth run of the inning, then struck 
out Erik Daniels to end the onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"Bushart got the ball up and into hittable areas and they hammered him," Kernen 
said. "We didn't really self-destruct, they just beat us." 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Denny Vigo hit Northridge's first home run in six games, a 
two-run shot. Northridge (22-14, 9-6 in conference play) made it 3-0 in the 
second inning on Greg Shockey's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
But after Pomona's six-run spurt, the Matadors could not respond sufficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Shockey drove in Mike Sims with a sacrifice fly in the fifth, and Vigo smacked 
his 10th home run in the sixth to cut the deficit to 6-5. But that's as close 
as Northridge could get against Pomona freshman Rich Rohde (2-0), who limited 
the Matadors to six hits in his first collegiate start. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sharts, who leads Northridge with 16 homers, struck out twice and did not 
get the ball out of the infield in four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts did not get a hit in the three-game series with Pomona (10-26, 4-12) and 
is hitless in his last 19 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been struggling," Kernen said. "There's always ups and downs during the 
season -- especially with power guys."

TOP 2 CLASH: EL SEGUNDO DEFEATS ST. BERNARD, 13-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In only a year and a half, the El Segundo-St. Bernard baseball series has 
become one of the South Bay's most entertaining and heated prep rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's showdown at Recreation Park in El Segundo had a little of 
everything: big hits, great plays, finger-pointing, taunting and the ejection 
of a star player. 
</P>
<P>
There's never a dull moment when these two teams meet. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, it's been a one-sided affair. El Segundo's 13-4 victory gave 
the Eagles a 3-0 edge over St. Bernard, which had been top dog in the Camino 
Real League before El Segundo joined the league last year and ended the 
Vikings' three-season reign as champion. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard was determined to regain its No. 1 spot Friday night. The Vikings 
came out pumping their fists and swinging their bats, opening a 2-0 lead in the 
first inning on back-to-back home runs by Sean Dunbar and Jeff Richardson. Both 
homers cleared the 320-foot sign in center field. 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely got our attention," El Segundo Coach John Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
First impressions are fine. But El Segundo made the lasting one, hammering St. 
Bernard ace pitcher Andy Diver for 14 hits, including three home runs, en route 
to an easy victory that forced a three-way tie for first place between El 
Segundo, St. Bernard and St. Anthony, all at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, ranked No. 1 in The Times' South Bay Top 10, improved to 13-2 
overall, while No. 2 St. Bernard slipped to 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, St. Bernard Coach Bob Yarnall said his team may have been too 
psyched up. Diver, who took a 5-0 record and 1.09 earned-run average into the 
game, struggled with his control after the first inning, and Richardson, the 
Vikings' top hitter with .500 average, was ejected in the third for trying to 
pull the ball out of El Segundo shortstop Mark Lewis' glove after a hard tag at 
second base. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost control emotionally," Yarnall said. "I think everybody was tired in 
the second inning because we were too wound up at the start of the game." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo held a 5-3 lead at that point after scoring five runs in the second 
on five hits, three walks and two errors. Eric Stevenson, the coach's son, 
highlighted the inning by drilling an 0-2 pitch through the left side of the 
infield with the bases loaded to drive in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Garret Quaintance's long home run and Brett Newell's two-run single highlighted 
a three-run third as El Segundo opened an 8-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
From there, St. Bernard never got closer than four runs. Quaintance led off the 
fourth with another deep home run to left-center field, and the Eagles added 
four runs in the fifth, highlighted by Lewis' three-run homer to right. 
</P>
<P>
Seefried was the beneficiary of his team's offensive exploits, improving his 
record to 5-0. The right-hander settled down nicely after a rocky start, 
allowing eight hits, striking out eight and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Diver (5-1) walked six and struck out only one. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Stevenson admitted that El Segundo may have been looking ahead to Friday 
night's game when it lost to St. Anthony, 4-3, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said that won't be a problem when St. Anthony visits Recreation Park 
on May 9. And it certainly won't be a problem when El Segundo and St. Bernard 
meet again May 11 at Loyola Marymount University on the final day of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The rematch could decide the league title. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo has scored 210 runs in 15 games, a pace that threatens the school 
season record of 308 set by the 1987 team and the Southern Section record of 
343 set by Montclair Prep in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles have 10 regular-season games left: seven in league play and three in 
the San Luis Obispo Tournament, which begins Wednesday. And it's likely El 
Segundo will play at least one 2-A Division playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's injury-riddled boys track team had its nine-year league winning 
streak of 53 consecutive dual meets snapped Thursday in a 70-57 Bay League loss 
to host Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who pulled out of Saturday's prestigious Arcadia Invitational 
because of a mounting list of injuries, competed without top sprinters Chris 
Alexander and Erik Allen (hamstring injuries) and distance runner Marcelo 
Vizueta (leg injury). 
</P>
<P>
Centennial has won only two Ocean League baseball games, but both have been 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The Apaches opened league play by handing Culver City its only loss to date, 
and they improved to 2-3 on Friday by upsetting host Redondo, 4-3. The loss 
knocked the Sea Hawks into a three-way tie for second place with Mira Costa and 
West Torrance, all at 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City (5-1) moved into undisputed first place with two hard-fought 
victories this week. The Centaurs used the one-hit, 13-strikeout pitching of 
left-hander Mauricio Estavil to edge Redondo, 1-0, on Thursday, and came back 
Friday to outlast host Mira Costa, 7-5, in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
It was originally reported that Estavil had thrown a no-hitter, but Culver City 
changed the scoring after Estavil said a disputed error in the seventh inning 
against the Centaurs' right fielder should have been ruled a hit for Redondo's 
Bobby Tassin. 
</P>
<P>
A team to watch in the Ocean League is South Torrance. The Spartans (3-3) beat 
Morningside, 16-2, Friday for their third straight league triumph.

VENTURA BOOTS MOORPARK OUT OF WSC LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A generally accepted baseball strategy is to hit it where they ain't, but 
Ventura College's Dan Madsen gained by hitting it where they were. 
</P>
<P>
Madsen hit a snake-tickling ground ball that went just under Moorpark shortstop 
Dan Smith's glove and then skipped below left fielder Jason Jones' glove. 
Madsen just kept running. 
</P>
<P>
"My speed isn't too great, not good at all," said Madsen, Ventura's catcher and 
No. 9 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by the time Moorpark returned the ball to the infield, Madsen had followed 
David Eggert home with what proved to be the winning run in Ventura's 8-3 
Western State Conference victory Saturday afternoon at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Madsen's single and Jones' subsequent three-base error ignited a five-run fifth 
inning that helped knock Moorpark (17-9, 12-4) out of the WSC lead. 
</P>
<P>
After losing two conference games this week, Moorpark trails first-place Cuesta 
by a half-game and second-place Canyons by percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which has beaten the conference's top three teams, remains mired in 
the middle of the pack with a 7-9 WSC mark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so inconsistent," Madsen said. "We'll play games like this, and the next 
time we'll give up 12, 13 runs." 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in 10 days, Ventura (15-12) beat a WSC opponent on its 
opponent's field to knock that school out of the conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
"What a roller-coaster ride we're on," Ventura Coach Gary Anglin said. "We're 
out searching for answers because of our lack of consistency . . . We're a 
one-pitcher team right now." 
</P>
<P>
That one pitcher, sophomore right-hander Mike Teron, had missed his last two 
starts because of shoulder trouble, but he scattered seven hits in nine strong 
innings Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Teron (7-2) struck out five, and had the Moorpark batters hitting them where 
his fielders were. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed every time we hit the ball hard, they had us played right," Moorpark 
Coach Ken Wagner said. "Teron, when he is on, is as good as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark starter and loser Willie Leighton (5-3) was nicked for two runs in the 
first inning, but retired 11 consecutive batters before the fateful fifth. 
</P>
<P>
With Ventura leading, 2-1, Eggert led off that inning with a single. He was 
headed for second on a hit-and-run play when Madsen's grounder bored a hole in 
the Moorpark defense and unleashed a flood of runs. 
</P>
<P>
"That got us down a little bit, but that shouldn't have gotten us down," Wagner 
said. "You've got to bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen's hit was followed by four singles and three more runs before Teron was 
thrown out at third to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura pushed its lead to 8-1 with another run in the sixth, and Moorpark 
scored single runs in the sixth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff hitter Smith was the only Moorpark player with more than one hit, and 
the Raiders had no extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which remains in contention for one of five conference playoff spots, 
was led by Gabe Diaz, who had two doubles and a single.

DAMEWORTH DEFEATED IN 3,200 METERS AT ARCADIA MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 3,200-meter event at the Arcadia Invitational was not a race. It was a 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Track aficionados at Arcadia High were stunned Saturday evening when Andy Maris 
of White River High in Buckley Wash., slipped past Agoura's Bryan Dameworth in 
the final 50 meters to hand the Charger senior his first loss in a distance 
race in almost a year, recording an 8-minute 53.78-second victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, who won the 3,200 in last year's invitational, clocked a 
personal-best 8:53.85. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more a cheap shot by me," said Maris, who shadowed Dameworth the entire 
race. "But I'm the underdog and I gotta do what I gotta do." 
</P>
<P>
And Maris did just that. The senior skipped the World Junior Cross-Country 
Championships March 24 in France to prepare for his confrontation with 
Dameworth, the Kinney national cross-country champion. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured this race was more important," said Jerry Maris, Andy's coach and 
older brother. "You got to be the best in the U. S. before you can race the 
world. This race was against the best." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth sensed the challenge from Maris, who finished second to him in the 
Kinney meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he couldn't be underestimated at all," Dameworth said, but everyone was 
telling me, 'Ah, don't worry about him.' 
</P>
<P>
"He got me." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth last lost a 3,200 decision when David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit won 
the event at the 1989 state championships in June. Dameworth finished second in 
9:00.27, his previous best before Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Abe Valdez posted a lifetime-best 9:02.09 in finishing third. Dan 
Berkeland of Canyon, Eliazar Herrera of Hoover and San Fernando's Obed Aguirre 
ran among the top seven for most of the race before settling for sixth 
(9:07.52), seventh (9:08.45) and ninth (9:10.38). 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham's Brian Gastelum shocked even himself by finishing second in the 
1,600 with a personal-best 4:09.87. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo Grande junior Louie Quintana held off a strong last-lap surge by 
Gastelum to win in 4:09.82, but the Brave senior was nonetheless euphoric. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this. This is great," said Gastelum, who set a goal of 4:11 
for himself on Wednesday but said he did not think he would meet it. 
</P>
<P>
The marks are the third- and fourth-fastest in the nation this year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rio Mesa freshman Marion Jones was shortening the gap between 
herself and Muir's Inger Miller in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
Jones got out of the blocks quickly but Miller, the No. 1-ranked sprinter in 
the nation, stormed past her with 40 meters remaining to win in 11.71. Jones 
clocked 11.78. 
</P>
<P>
The Miller-Jones showdown in the 200 was even more of an eye-opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Muir senior raced to a nation-leading 23.57 mark to win by three meters and 
Jones finished second in 23.80, setting a 14-year-old national age record. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 3,200, Agoura junior Deena Drossin finished a distant third 
behind Livermore's Becky Spies and Kimberly Orlando of Carson City, Nev., in 
10:42.39. Spies held off Orlando to win in 10:36.56. Orlando timed 10:36.67. 
</P>
<P>
In Novemeber, Drossin edged Spies for the state Division I cross-country 
championship and finished third (10:36.67 personal best) in the 3,200 at the 
state track meet in June. Spies was third in the 800 at 2:11.85.

HARPER OFF TO A FAST START AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Harper waited four years for a Sportsman division main-event victory 
before finally winning two -- and the track championship -- last season at 
Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Harper, along with the 4,631 fans in attendance, waited 50 
minutes for his first victory of the season in the division's season-opening 
40-lap main event. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who started sixth, steered his way into the lead on Lap 32 and held off 
Lance Hooper of Palmdale and Dave Phipps of Simi Valley to win. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, five yellow flags -- one which slowed action for 15 minutes -- 
and a red flag delayed proceedings considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley, sixth last season, started on the pole and led 
until Harper slid past after the race's fifth yellow flag. Rayburn, however, 
fell to fifth behind John Cran of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Beckers of Sepulveda won easily in the season-opening Street Stock 
division 25-lap oval main event. Beckers, who started in second position, 
vaulted into the lead on the second lap and survived three yellow flags and 
hard charges from Brian Kelley of Arleta and Thad Friday of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, last season's Hobby Stock division champion, made skilled passes on 
Laps 15 and 23 to finish second. Friday held off defending champion Steve 
Nickolai of Simi Valley to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley won the accident-free 15-lap 
Street Stock oval semi-main event. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12-lap Sportsman semi-main, Jerry Johnson of Rancho Palos Verdes led 
from the pole to win. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Sportsman heat-race winners included 1989 Rookie of the Year Larry 
Krieger of Reseda, Tom Eurton of Valencia and Rodney Peacher of Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Street Stock oval heat race winners included 1988 track champion Dave 
Blankenship of Reseda, Mike Branam of Lakeview Terrace, and Gerrit Cromsigt and 
Allen Thacker, both of Palmdale .

CRAWFORD'S TOWNSEND SUFFERS FIRST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While one was running out of gas, the other was running out of time. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening game of the AA division of the Lions baseball tournament against 
Crawford, USDHS pitcher Tom Shanner was pulled after the fifth inning with a 
two-hit, four-strikeout effort to his credit, and USDHS leading, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"For four innings he was OK," USDHS Coach Dick Serrano said, "then he ran out 
of gas." 
</P>
<P>
As Gavin Millay replaced Shanner, Crawford pitcher Chris Townsend, with an 
undefeated high school pitching record on the line, was hoping something would 
spark Crawford's offense. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing did. In fact, sixth-ranked USDHS scored again in the sixth and held on 
for a 3-1 victory Saturday morning at Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, whose consecutive victory record was snapped at 13, had to adjust to 
his first loss in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when pitch so well and end up losing," said Townsend (4-1), who had 
seven strikeouts and gave up seven hits and three runs (one unearned). "We just 
got beat, I don't really know what it was." 
</P>
<P>
What it was, quite simply, was USDHS scoring the winning run in much the same 
manner as Crawford had scored its only run at the top of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
After Shanner walked Sal Vidrios and Eric Brier with two outs, Vidrios scored 
from second on a throwing error to first base by the USDHS shortstop. Shanner 
got out of the inning on a force out at second. 
</P>
<P>
"We only had one bad defensive play, and it cost us a run," Serrano said. 
</P>
<P>
Two batters later -- Townsend struck out the first -- the Dons' Tom Tate 
doubled to left field. Gary Remiker filed out to center, and Tate scored from 
second to make it 2-1 when Crawford's shortstop overthrew first. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a few crucial errors," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
USDHS (11-3), which has lived, and won, by the one-, two- and three-run games 
this season, was relieved to gets some key hits against Crawford (10-3). 
</P>
<P>
"We got some timely hitting and some good defense," said Shanner (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Tate came out of a mild slump and went two for three, scored twice and had a 
stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
"I was seeing the ball pretty well today," Tate said. "(Townsend) pitched well, 
but I just tried to relax and wait for the right pitch." 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Tate drilled a shot to left field, stole second, stopped at third 
on a single by Remiker, then scored on a fielder's choice when the throw home 
was a fraction late. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Jeff Desjardins scored for USDHS on David Sanchez' RBI single.

WIND HELPS UC'S PRICE TO 25-8 1/2 IN LONG JUMP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early Saturday at the Titan Coca-Cola Track Festival at Poway, Jerome Price of 
University City had failed in his bid to regain the yearly county lead in the 
long jump. Price's 23-feet-10 was an inch short of the 23-11 by Roque Balina of 
Mt. Carmel last week. 
</P>
<P>
Price was more impressive later in the day, albeit with a little help. Price 
sailed 25-8 1/2 with an aiding wind to win the event at the Arcadia 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
The leap was more than a foot longer than Price's legal personal best of 24-7 
3/4 set in last year's state meet, when he finished second to the 26-4 3/4 
state record by Tulare's James Stallworth. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's Brent Noon won both weight events impressively, although he did not 
come close to personal bests in either. Noon threw 71-4 1/4 to win the shotput 
(well short of his nation-leading 73-5 3/4) and 192-11 for a victory in the 
discus. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Coca-Cola Track Festival -- Runners were talking about the cold, damp 
weather at Poway. 
</P>
<P>
That says something about the kind of marks they were turning in. 
</P>
<P>
Only two individual season section bests were established at the meet, usually 
one of the best as far as times and distances go. 
</P>
<P>
One 1990 county best was in the boys' invitational 400 meters, in which 
Montgomery's Art Hernandez ran 49.24 seconds. Hernandez, whose previous best 
this season was 51.0, is first in the county to run under 50.0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The other came in the girls' invitational 300-meter low hurdles, in which Erin 
Blunt of San Pasqual ran a personal best of 44.6. Blunt's 45.1 had also been 
fastest in the county this year. 
</P>
<P>
Blunt led from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"My coach (Paul Kinder) has a saying, 'Catch me if you can,' " Blunt said. "It 
means start out fast and hang on. He told me that a couple weeks ago. I kind of 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
Section season bests were also set in the 400- and 1,600-meter relays. Lincoln 
ran 43.31 for the 400, Morse 3:25.04 for the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
University City's Angela Kimmey was trying to better her section best in the 
100 meters, but after running a 12.1 in her first meet two weeks ago, she won 
at Poway in 12.29. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines' high jumper Karyn Armstrong, who on Thursday cleared 5-7 1/4, was 
also looking for a section best but also fell short. She jumped 5-2 before 
bowing out with a sore ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park's Eric Bell tried a new approach in the 110 high hurdles -- hitting 
them instead of clearing them. But despite tipping six of the 10 hurdles, Bell, 
the section leader in the event, placed first at 14.8 in the invitational race. 
</P>
<P>
Bell took down the first hurdle with his trail leg, opening a wound on his 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man, I didn't even see that," Bell said. "I must have hit that first one 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Because he hit it with his trail leg, he couldn't get any thrust for the second 
hurdle. His entire race was then thrown off. 
</P>
<P>
So too was that of Poway hurdler Kim Dill in the 100-meter lows, but for 
another reason. 
</P>
<P>
Dill got over the hurdles all right, but she was still trying to catch her 
breath after running the anchor leg of the 800-meter relay that Poway won at 
1:47.06. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bell, Dill won with a sub-par effort, 14.94, well off her county best of 
14.68. 
</P>
<P>
"During the (hurdles) race," Dill said, "All I could think of was, 'I'm tired 
-- where is the end.' I was debating whether I should stop or not." 
</P>
<P>
Dill was pressured the entire way by Esperanza's Nikki Jackson, who finished in 
15.03, but Dill failed to see her. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel anybody at all during the race until I finished," Dill said. "I 
never even noticed (Jackson). I was just trying so hard to finish." JOHN GEIS

CUBAN BASEBALL: IT'S BIG LEAGUE IN ITS OWN WAY

HAVANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tired of baseball lockouts and strikes? Wish the game were played more for fun 
than for money? 
</P>
<P>
Come to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, the play is very much big league: Fastballs that hum in at 90 
plus mph and double plays turned as smoothly as the swings of the guys with the 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Javier Mendez uncoil from his slight crouch and belt one over the sign 
advertising Fidel Castro's next big speech. Like Cuba's politics, Mendez swings 
from the left. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like he would feel at home in almost any big league lineup. Off the 
field, though, U.S. and Cuban baseball are as different as the two countries' 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as an "owner" in the George Steinbrenner sense. All 
enterprises in Cuba belong to the state, including baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are there "player demands" in Cuba. These fellows, some of them world class 
players, have to settle for their 100 pesos or so a month, no questions asked. 
Collective bargaining? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba-born Jose Canseco, who left the island as an infant, makes about as much 
playing for the Oakland A's in a single inning (over $1,000) as the average 
Cuban player makes in a year and that's no typo. 
</P>
<P>
There's no army of people needed here to handle finances. Admission is free and 
there are no advertising revenues. (Castro gets to put up his sign for free. He 
has other ballpark signs as well: "Socialism or Death" and "Ready to Conquer.") 
</P>
<P>
By U.S. standards, Cuban players endure extraordinary hardships. All travel is 
done by bus on this 800-mile wide island. Because of the U.S. embargo, 
American-made aluminum bats, the kind Cubans prefer, are in short supply. Some 
players are forced to use a bat size not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
Several teams, including Havana, live in barracks-like structures. Even during 
homestands, the players get to go home to their government-provided apartments 
only on the days always set aside for open dates, Mondays and Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
If a player is a student during the off-season, his salary could be as low as 
50 pesos a month. At the official exchange rate, that's only about $45. Kirby 
Puckett spills that much before breakfast. Can you imagine Orel Hershiser 
toiling away for $45 a month? 
</P>
<P>
If a player works as a 150-peso a-month laborer during the off season, he makes 
the same salary when he's playing ball. If he averages three homers and 10 
RBI's a game, it makes no difference: 150 pesos a month, end discussion. 
</P>
<P>
But with housing, food and transportation provided for, the players don't 
complain, at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rich but we have our needs resolved," says Juan Padilla, a whiz 
around second base for the Havana team. 
</P>
<P>
Ahh, Cuban baseball. Memories of Minnie Minoso, Pedro Ramos, Sandy Amoros, 
Camilo Pasqual, Tony Perez. The Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. 
In the last 22 world amateur baseball championships, Cuba has won 19 times, 
finished second once and third twice, according to Baseball Commissioner Manuel 
Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable baseball men figure 35 to 40 Cubans are of major league calibre. 
Cuban pitching appears to be mostly minor league level but it's not hard to 
envision Cubans at other positions, particularly infielders, dazzling crowds at 
Candlestick or Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his lavishly paid counterparts in the U.S. "ligas grandes," 
Mendez, 25, shrugs and says he sees no need for salaries in the million-plus 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when that kind of money corrupts," he says. Castro agrees, 
often lamenting that the U.S. is plagued by "irrational consumerism." Some 
people, he says, think they have to have "65 shirts." Wonder what he would say 
about major leaguers who buy Mercedes by the six-pack? 
</P>
<P>
Mendez is standing in the barracks where he and his mates from the Havana team 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The season is 23 games old and Mendez has been brutalizing opposing pitching, 
hitting a league-leading .392. He has six home runs and 19 RBI's. Injuries 
hampered his performance in previous seasons but no longer. It's about four 
hours before gametime, and most of the team is watching an afternoon soap opera 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
The trappings for the players evoke memories of boot camp: seven players to a 
room, no privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Servio Borges calls the place a "sporting motel." It is located in the 
heart of a sports complex south of the city. Much of the area is devoted to 
training athletic instructors. 
</P>
<P>
With a 17-6 record, Havana is leading the eight-team league in what is known as 
the "serie selectiva," the prestige tournament of the several Cuba holds each 
year. Many players compete virtually all 12 months. The "selectiva" is the 
competition Cuban fans wait for. The winner of the 63-game season gets to play 
abroad and earns bug-eyed adulation from their fans. With fewer players, the 
calibre of play is higher than the 18-team national competition held between 
November and January. 
</P>
<P>
Borges, 43, likes the idea of having his players live under one roof. Last 
year, they all lived at home and the team played poorly, so poorly that the 
local Communist Party chapter sat down with the team for a pep talk. (This 
happens to other teams as well.) 
</P>
<P>
Borges says discipline is better this year and the record shows it. Still, he's 
antsy. The pressures on him are no less than those faced by Tom Lasorda or Don 
Zimmer. There's not much to do in Cuba, so people watch baseball and root hard. 
Morales, the baseball commissioner, says 72% of Cuban televisions are regularly 
tuned in to a game. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a one-time pitching prospect before making a career switch, likes the 
Santiago team from Cuba's east end. He was raised nearby and, besides, that is 
the city where the revolution began. 
</P>
<P>
Borges feels he and his team are constantly under the microscope. The 
"Girardillos," as his team is called, finished in second place four years in a 
row and it's been 15 years since Havana has won the "selectiva." The fans are 
getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular evening, the team dines together on pork chops at the sports 
complex and then boards the bus for the half hour ride to Latin American 
Stadium. As usual, Borges is nervous. The bus takes off behind schedule and he 
won't have time for the pregame meeting. Borges insists his players are nervous 
as well but the horseplay on the bus leaves a different impression. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's opponent is Las Villas, a team from the central part of the country, 
and Havana is gunning for a three-game sweep. From the dressing room, the 
Havana team (known officially as Ciudad Habana) heads for the field, descending 
cement steps that have been chipped away by player spikes since 1946 when this 
relic, unsullied by artificial turf, was built. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium seats 60,000 (some other playing fields in the league hold only 
12,000) but there is a homey atmosphere, with many seats close to the action. 
It has a charm that some of the astroturfed U.S. ballfields lack. 
</P>
<P>
There are relatively few private cars in Cuba so most fans walk to the park or 
take the bus. Shortly before gametime, with about 25,000 people in the stadium, 
about a third of the parking lot -- there are only about 150 spaces -- is 
filled. For the fans, the nice part is walking in and sitting down free of 
charge. The choicest seats are reserved for families of the players and VIP's. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is relaxed. Here at least, the totalitarian police state 
ambience that American conservatives fret about is missing. Blacks predominate 
in the stands and on the playing field. Fans are expected to return foul balls 
hit into the stands. About 10 to 15 balls are used per game, well below the 
major league average. 
</P>
<P>
A strapping right-hander, Lazaro Valle, only 19, has been picked to start for 
the home team. Borges says he's one of the three best pitchers in the league. 
Control would be his biggest problem tonight. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Girardillos are having few problems solving the Las Villas 
starter, Roberto Almarales, a slim righty. The home team, clad in blue and 
white, gets to him early.

WAGES OF GOVERNING EXPLODE FOR OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTIVES: THOUSAND OAKS APPLIES 'GOLDEN HANDCUFF' -- LARGE SALARIES -- TO 
ADMINISTRATORS TO PREVENT THEM FROM LEAVING FOR OTHER JOBS.

<P>
In the world of city management, it is increasingly a seller's market. And 
cities in Ventura County are beginning to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
When William Little was hired as Camarillo city manager in late 1988, he left a 
much larger city -- and still got a $10,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, after a lengthy search for a new city attorney, Ventura lured Peter 
Bulens into the fold by agreeing to lend him $100,000 to help him buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
And in Thousand Oaks, where City Manager Grant Brimhall receives $109,488 a 
year, the highest municipal salary in the county, it is policy to pay top 
administrators so well that the city's "golden handcuff" will keep them from 
applying elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony of the situation is that I have people say, 'How in the world do you 
live on that?' and others who say, 'Boy, I wish I made your salary,' " said 
Brimhall, past president of the statewide city managers' association. 
</P>
<P>
The wages of many top city and county administrators have risen sharply 
throughout the state in recent years, partly in response to escalating pay 
packages offered by private industry, public management experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing in the last several years is that city managers are looked 
at more like chief executive officers in private industry," said Sheri 
Erlewine, spokeswoman for the League of California Cities. "The job is tougher, 
more complex today. The issues are local and regional. And councils know they 
have to pay their managers more." 
</P>
<P>
High housing prices in coastal urban areas such as Ventura County are forcing 
city councils to pay salaries they would not have considered just two or three 
years ago, professional recruiters say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very fast-changing market," said Norman Roberts of Los Angeles, who 
helped bring Bulens from the San Francisco Bay Area to Ventura and is directing 
the search for a new city manager in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"You are looking at city managers who are making 15% to 20% more than they were 
two years ago," he said. "And that's a lot when you're talking about $100,000 
salaries." 
</P>
<P>
Some government executives in the Bay Area, including Santa Clara County's 
chief administrative officer, make nearly $150,000 annually and receive housing 
subsidies, he said. Los Angeles County's chief administrator makes about 
$138,000, up from $98,000 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts figures that Oxnard will have to increase its city manager's pay 
perhaps $10,000 to hire a top applicant to replace David R. Mora, who receives 
$103,200 a year. There are about 50 candidates so far and recruiting continues, 
he said. Mora, who was fired, leaves June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts compares today's volatile market for city and county managers and 
attorneys to the free-agency system in major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes seem to happen when they hire somebody new," Roberts said. Or, 
less frequently, when cities want to keep a popular manager whose skill is 
undisputed and who is the target of recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wittenberg, Ventura County's chief administrative officer, has 
benefited from employers' new aggressiveness in retaining top managers. With a 
salary of $117,720, he earns the top dollar allowed by the county's pay scale 
and is the area's best paid government official. He also makes more than 
several of the chief administrators in the state's 10 largest counties. Ventura 
is the 11th largest. 
</P>
<P>
His worth apparently increased after he ranked first in a 1985 search for a new 
chief executive in Los Angeles County, the nation's largest. After a political 
stalemate, a compromise candidate was eventually hired. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Wittenberg, chief executive here since 1978, received the first 
long-term contract ever awarded for his position by the Board of Supervisors. 
That four-year deal was extended late last year, months before the contract 
expired, until mid-1994. 
</P>
<P>
Little typifies the free-agent manager whose talents fit the needs of a city. 
Camarillo needed a fiscal expert to reverse a $4.2-million budget deficit 
created by disastrous bond investments. Little, a 25-year city manager, knew 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
So Camarillo agreed to a salary of nearly $100,000 a year, well above the 
market and nearly $10,000 more than Little said he made in the city of Orange, 
which has twice the population. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, a city has to pay for what it gets. That goes for police chiefs or 
directors of finance," Little said. "Like any profession, you get what you pay 
for. And as far as I can tell, this has been a good match." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo now has a modest budget surplus, said Little, whose salary is 
$102,552. Some of the city's department heads are among the best paid in the 
county, especially considering that Camarillo has only about 50,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
If Little's situation shows the allure of a fix-it manager from outside, 
Thousand Oaks' treatment of Brimhall illustrates how a city can make a good 
manager want to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
Hired in 1978, the 52-year-old Brimhall said he stays in government partly 
because he is motivated by the job in Thousand Oaks, a city he views as 
progressive, sophisticated and in tune with local issues. A recent opinion 
survey of city residents brought an unusually high 37% response, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To stay in the public sector takes a certain amount of masochistic behavior. 
You must be willing to work 60-hour weeks and live in a fishbowl," Brimhall 
said. "But I enjoy the public life. And I was in the private sector before and 
made enough money so I can enjoy being a city manager." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been offered twice what I make now from several different types of 
companies -- all the way from the family-owned to a Fortune 500," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Brimhall's assistants join him as top earners among local municipal 
employees. For example, Assistant City Manager MaryJane Lazz makes $88,164 a 
year, nearly $8,000 more than John Tooker in Oxnard, the county's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
That is by design, said Greg Eckman, personnel director for Thousand Oaks. 
Maximum management salaries there are set by averaging peak wages in 10 
comparable cities, then adding 20%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it the 'golden handcuff,' " Eckman said. "We try to keep managers who 
are performing in an outstanding fashion. And we have the ability to pay, so we 
can make it difficult for them to leave. We don't want to be a training ground 
for other employers." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Thousand Oaks has become something of a municipal raider of employee 
talent. Wittenberg grumbled that he has lost good people to the city. "We're 
proud of that fact," Eckman said. "We've picked up professional planners, 
engineers and accountants from the county." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County, though an employer with more than 6,000 jobs -- compared to 410 
in Thousand Oaks -- has fallen behind in pay and benefits for many employees, 
Wittenberg said. It has not been able to fill about 10% of its jobs, including 
numerous mid- and high-level positions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The area's quality of life is attractive and wages are not bad, Wittenberg 
said, but housing prices kill deals with top job candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people can do as well elsewhere and buy a house for half the price," 
Wittenberg said. "In my own office, I've tried to recruit people, and they've 
said it's not worth it. They can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of shelter -- the median price of a house locally is second in 
the state to the Bay Area -- has effectively limited coastal cities and 
counties to recruiting among themselves. Or they can make their offers more 
attractive with housing subsidies, a common practice in private industry. 
Cities as small as Fillmore, which in 1985 lent a former city manager 85% of 
the price of a home, have made housing part of their offers. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, recruitment from Northern California is hardly a sure thing because 
of a bias against Southern California, recruiters said. Roberts said he had to 
talk a reluctant Bulens onto a plane to Ventura last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"He talked to me and he had to do a little convincing, because I thought this 
area was just more Los Angeles," Bulens said. "After I got down there, I said, 
'No, this isn't L.A., this is better.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet the former Mountain View city attorney said he would not have moved here 
for his $5,000 pay raise and a slightly larger staff without housing 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura City Council made him its first beneficiary of an "equity sharing" 
deal. The city paid $100,000 toward Bulens' purchase of a home and will get its 
money back when the house is sold. It will also get a share of the profit if 
the property's value increases. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a lot more difficult to move around in California than it used to be. 
Your field of search is narrowed," Bulens said. Even with the subsidy, Bulens 
said, he has sleepless nights because of payments on a still-unsold home in the 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys may be the hottest commodities in the new market for top 
administrators, hiring specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County, which is half the size of Ventura County, just hired a 
new counsel for $115,000 a year. Ventura County's chief attorney, James 
McBride, makes $101,520. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go out in that market for a county counsel, you really ought to grab 
your shorts, because it's really competitive out there," said Chuck Wagner, 
chief executive for Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiter Roberts said there is a shortage of local government attorneys 
because many have gone to work for private firms that specialize in municipal 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The legal work of six of 10 local cities is done through contract with private 
firms. Port Hueneme, for example, has $83,000 in its budget for legal services.

ROWING: PROTEST FORCES A RERUN OF PREMIER MEN'S COLLEGE EVENT IN THE SAN DIEGO 
CREW CLASSIC, DEPRIVING WASHINGTON OF AN APPARENT VICTORY.

<P>
The University of Washington dropped from first to last in its second attempt 
to win the Copley Cup Saturday in the premier race of the 17th San Diego Crew 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies thought they had won the first major regatta of the collegiate 
rowing season, but Wisconsin's protest that it didn't get a proper start forced 
a re-row, the first any official could remember in the event. 
</P>
<P>
Defending NCAA champion Harvard, which had made a strong dash in the first 
race, only to finish a quarter of a boat length behind Washington, won the 
second final, beating UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA won the main prize for college women, the Whittier Cup, beating Cal by 
nearly five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest race for us ever," UCLA Coach Kelly Salonites. "We've 
never won anything, and to come away winning the JV and the varsity is more 
than we could have ever hoped for; it's fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
That was a good description for the first running of the men's varsity 
heavyweight final. Harvard moved from fourth to second, but Washington held 
them off over the final 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But Wisconsin protested after finishing fourth. A stiff crosswind at the start 
had it pointed about 20 degrees off its mark, and coxswain Mark Sniderman said 
he was trying to get the starter's attention when she signaled the race's 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
After a delay of an hour and 15 minutes, the second final was run, and 
Washington went down the tubes. Harvard won the 2,000-meter race in 6 minutes 
11.31 seconds, ahead of UCLA (6:15.45), Navy (6:16.0), Syracuse (6:18.44), 
Wisconsin (6:20.77) and the Huskies (6:21.68). 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite clear (Washington) raced for all they were worth in the first 
race, but we did too," said Harvard Coach Harry Parker. "I was not at all 
confident that we were going to come up with such a strong row the second time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was very, very hard for (Washington) to get back in the water. I 
don't think anybody, even Wisconsin, likes to go through that routine. On the 
other hand, I do think they deserved a fair race, and it didn't seem like they 
got it the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Bob Ernst was upset afterward, and not just because it lost to 
rival Harvard, which beat Washington for the national championship last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the race, and the other guys got a second chance on life," he said. "I 
don't care who won it ultimately; we won it the first time and that's all that 
matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ernst said that official Julian Wolf, who upheld the protest, emphasized at a 
Thursday meeting for officials, coaches and coxswains, that boats that weren't 
ready should not start the race; they should simply sit and allow officials to 
call a restart. 
</P>
<P>
"(Wisconsin) should have stayed there. That specific question was discussed at 
the meeting," Ernst said. "He's the head official, and he's the one who changed 
it today." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not always supposed to stay; it's mostly a judgment call," Sniderman 
said. "Bob Ernst is right in some ways, and I can understand that he's got to 
be madder than hell right now, but when you're on the line, and they hear 'Etes 
vous prets? Partez!' ("Are you ready? Go!"), they go, and there's nothing you 
can do as a coxswain to stop them. And once everyone's going, you might as well 
keep going. 
</P>
<P>
"I toyed with the idea (of trying to stop the boat), but I didn't think the 
officials would award us a new start; I didn't think the damage was that bad, 
and once we got past 100 meters, they won't allow you to stop. It's definitely 
not an absolute law that you've got to sit on the line. It's the official's 
call, and I think they made the right call in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Sniderman and bowman Nick Donovan were trying to get the starter's attention 
when the race began. Sniderman said it takes about 20 seconds to go 100 meters, 
but in those decisive seconds, he opted to compete first and protest later. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. For Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Rowing Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego teams that won were Eosophobic, out of the Mission Bay Rowing Assn., 
in Women's Master 8 27-plus (years); ZLAC Rowing Club, Women's Master 8 
37-plus, and San Diego State men's lightweight, Cal-Visitor Challenge Petite 
(consolation). . . . The UCLA varsity women (7:13.62) beat Pacific 10 rivals 
Cal (7:18.53), Stanford (7:19.07) and Washington (7:24.89). Wisconsin and 
Pennsylvania followed. Senior Leslie Lewis said, "I think I knew that we were 
fast, but not quite how fast. A lot of teams taper for this race, but this is 
just our first race, and we used it as a part of training. We weren't saying 
that we were coming here to win, we just wanted to see how we stacked up 
against the competition." . . . More than 80 universities and clubs 
participated.

MUTUAL FUNDS: DO YOU KNOW WHO'S MANAGING YOUR PORTFOLIO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WERNER RENBERG, WERNER RENBERG is co-author of Making Money with Mutual 
Funds and author of a forthcoming book, The Bond Fund Advisor. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Lynch certainly shocked the world of mutual funds last month with an 
announcement that he would soon retire as the superstar portfolio manager of 
the Fidelity Magellan Fund, where a sizzling long-term track record has 
attracted 1 million shareholder accounts. 
</P>
<P>
His retirement at the age of 46 -- in essence, he said it was time to smell the 
roses -- highlights some lingering questions about mutual funds: 
</P>
<P>
How much does a fund's performance depend on who's managing it? Is a change in 
portfolio managers likely to make a significant difference? How critical is the 
role of one individual? 
</P>
<P>
Should mutual fund shareholders be advised when a change is made in portfolio 
managers? Should mutual funds identify their portfolio managers at all? How 
exactly should they do that? 
</P>
<P>
In many and perhaps most cases, management of a fund is handled by just one 
individual who makes day-to-day decisions on what securities to buy or sell and 
at what prices. In other cases, a fund's investments are handled by 
co-managers, teams or committees. Whatever the structure, managers operate 
within policy guidelines and under the supervision of boards of directors or 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Given the central role of managers, you would think that funds might be 
required to tell investors who they are and when they quit, retire, die or are 
fired. They don't. 
</P>
<P>
The Investment Company Act of 1940, the framework for mutual fund regulation, 
only requires that a fund report the name of the investment adviser -- 
generally a firm with responsibility for portfolio management under a contract 
with the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio managers are usually employees of the investment adviser. Sometimes, 
the portfolio manager and the investment adviser are one and the same. (For 
example, at Nicholas Co., where Albert O. Nicholas, portfolio manager of the 
Nicholas Fund and others, is the only stockholder.) At other firms, managers 
may be minority shareholders as well as employees. 
</P>
<P>
For many mutual fund investors, knowing the name of the investment adviser is 
not enough. A company name doesn't tell them much. They also want to know the 
individual actually making investment decisions. When comparing several funds' 
performance records -- a critical step in deciding which of them offer the best 
opportunities -- investors want to know whether the managers responsible for 
the funds' performance track records are still in charge. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff proposed 
twice in the past decade -- 1982 and 1984 -- that funds make public the names 
of portfolio managers. On both occasions, the proposals were withdrawn in the 
face of strong opposition by the mutual fund industry. A number contended that 
investors were really investing in the investment advisers who had contractual 
obligations with the mutual funds, not in individuals who could leave any day. 
</P>
<P>
At least since the mid-1980s, however, some fund management companies have 
tried to have it both ways. Apparently regarding their managers as 
personalities whose market comments could help to sell fund shares -- or whose 
reassuring words could help to discourage redemptions at the time of a 
"correction" -- funds began to give them higher visibility. Increasingly, 
portfolio managers' comments were published in mutual fund annual reports; 
profiles about them appeared in newsletters distributed to shareholders, and 
they were widely available for newspaper, magazine and television interviews. 
</P>
<P>
With the greatly increased investor interest in mutual funds and their 
portfolio managers, the SEC staff last January submitted a new proposal for 
public and industry comment. It would require that a fund's prospectus provide 
disclosure "about all the persons who significantly contribute to the 
investment advice relied on to manage the fund's portfolio." It also would 
require a fund to notify investors of a change by means of a sticker applied to 
the mutual fund's prospectus, which already includes detailed information about 
investment objectives, performance, fees and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Investment Company Institute, the industry's trade association, criticized 
these provisions for being too sweeping, requiring too much information about 
too many people and adding unnecessarily to the cost of preparing a prospectus. 
The institute prefers to limit disclosure to those portfolio managers who are 
promoted publicly and whose retention is critical to a fund's success. 
</P>
<P>
There were some who supported the SEC staff proposal, however. John C. Bogle, 
chairman of the Vanguard Group, supported it on grounds that investors had the 
right to know, and added that funds should spell out their management process. 
(Wellington Fund's recently released prospectus is the first in Vanguard Group, 
and perhaps the industry, to describe the credentials of a portfolio manager: 
Vincent Bajakian, who has run it since 1972.) 
</P>
<P>
Just as the SEC staff was going through the responses to its proposal, Fidelity 
Magellan's manager, Peter Lynch, decided to, as he put it, "turn in my 
Quotron." Fidelity acted quickly to disseminate the news, including the 
appointment of Morris Smith, portfolio manager of the Fidelity OTC Portfolio, 
as Lynch's successor. It pasted stickers on prospectuses, prepared a flier to 
be mailed with confirmation statements to those buying Magellan shares and 
announced that it would move up production of the annual report for the fiscal 
year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity let it be known, however, that this was an unusual case and not 
necessarily a pattern that will be followed when other managers leave. 
</P>
<P>
While the sticker may be an industry first, the mention in the annual report 
won't be. T. Rowe Price, for example, used the 1988 annual report of its 
Capital Appreciation Fund to announce that Richard P. Howard had succeeded 
Richard H. Fontaine as its manager. It's a rarity, though. Scudder, Stevens 
&amp; Clark, for instance, did not report on the resignation of Andrew Massie 
Jr. last year, even though he left only weeks after being identified as 
"manager of the top-ranked Scudder Capital Growth Fund" in the summer 1989 
edition of its shareholder newsletter. When Massie quit, the company took the 
position that he had been "one of several highly talented professionals" who 
manage the fund and that "the fund's management team remained substantially in 
place." 
</P>
<P>
When all is said and done, how much does a change really affect a fund's 
performance? Industry students such as A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper 
Analytical Services, and John Markese, research director of the American Assn. 
of Individual Investors, agree that it's very hard to calculate. 
</P>
<P>
To see just how hard, take a look at the accompanying table and see if you can 
rely on year-to-year performance figures to pick out which funds experienced a 
change in management. A fund's annual return can fluctuate sharply even without 
a managerial change. Fidelity Magellan, for one, has underperformed the overall 
market in some years while the same manager remained at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it's tough to correlate," Markese says, "people should have the 
information about a change as soon as the event is known. They want the 
information." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHICH OF THESE FUNDS CHANGED MANAGERS -- AND WHEN? 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: Five of these six mutual funds changed portfolio managers during the 
years tabulated. Can you figure out which five and when they changed? ("Peer 
group" refers to funds with similar investment objectives.)

CUBAN BASEBALL: IT'S BIG LEAGUE IN ITS OWN WAY

Tired of baseball lockouts and strikes? Wish the game were played more for fun 
than for money? 
</P>
<P>
Come to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, the play is very much big league: Fastballs that hum in at 90 
plus mph and double plays turned as smoothly as the swings of the guys with the 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Javier Mendez uncoil from his slight crouch and belt one over the sign 
advertising Fidel Castro's next big speech. Like Cuba's politics, Mendez swings 
from the left. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like he would feel at home in almost any big league lineup. Off the 
field, though, U.S. and Cuban baseball are as different as the two countries' 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as an "owner" in the George Steinbrenner sense. All 
enterprises in Cuba belong to the state, including baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are there "player demands" in Cuba. These fellows, some of them world class 
players, have to settle for their 100 pesos or so a month, no questions asked. 
Collective bargaining? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba-born Jose Canseco, who left the island as an infant, makes about as much 
playing for the Oakland A's in a single inning (over $1,000) as the average 
Cuban player makes in a year and that's no typo. 
</P>
<P>
There's no army of people needed here to handle finances. Admission is free and 
there are no advertising revenues. (Castro gets to put up his sign for free. He 
has other ballpark signs as well: "Socialism or Death" and "Ready to Conquer.") 
</P>
<P>
By U.S. standards, Cuban players endure extraordinary hardships. All travel is 
done by bus on this 800-mile wide island. Because of the U.S. embargo, 
American-made aluminum bats, the kind Cubans prefer, are in short supply. Some 
players are forced to use a bat size not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
Several teams, including Havana, live in barracks-like structures. Even during 
homestands, the players get to go home to their government-provided apartments 
only on the days always set aside for open dates, Mondays and Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
If a player is a student during the off-season, his salary could be as low as 
50 pesos a month. At the official exchange rate, that's only about $45. Kirby 
Puckett spills that much before breakfast. Can you imagine Orel Hershiser 
toiling away for $45 a month? 
</P>
<P>
If a player works as a 150-peso a-month laborer during the off season, he makes 
the same salary when he's playing ball. If he averages three homers and 10 
RBI's a game, it makes no difference: 150 pesos a month, end discussion. 
</P>
<P>
But with housing, food and transportation provided for, the players don't 
complain, at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rich but we have our needs resolved," says Juan Padilla, a whiz 
around second base for the Havana team. 
</P>
<P>
Ahh, Cuban baseball. Memories of Minnie Minoso, Pedro Ramos, Sandy Amoros, 
Camilo Pasqual, Tony Perez. The Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. 
In the last 22 world amateur baseball championships, Cuba has won 19 times, 
finished second once and third twice, according to Baseball Commissioner Manuel 
Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable baseball men figure 35 to 40 Cubans are of major league calibre. 
Cuban pitching appears to be mostly minor league level but it's not hard to 
envision Cubans at other positions, particularly infielders, dazzling crowds at 
Candlestick or Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his lavishly paid counterparts in the U.S. "ligas grandes," 
Mendez, 25, shrugs and says he sees no need for salaries in the million-plus 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when that kind of money corrupts," he says. Castro agrees, 
often lamenting that the U.S. is plagued by "irrational consumerism." Some 
people, he says, think they have to have "65 shirts." Wonder what he would say 
about major leaguers who buy Mercedes by the six-pack? 
</P>
<P>
Mendez is standing in the barracks where he and his mates from the Havana team 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The season is 23 games old and Mendez has been brutalizing opposing pitching, 
hitting a league-leading .392. He has six home runs and 19 RBI's. Injuries 
hampered his performance in previous seasons but no longer. It's about four 
hours before gametime, and most of the team is watching an afternoon soap opera 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
The trappings for the players evoke memories of boot camp: seven players to a 
room, no privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Servio Borges calls the place a "sporting motel." It is located in the 
heart of a sports complex south of the city. Much of the area is devoted to 
training athletic instructors. 
</P>
<P>
With a 17-6 record, Havana is leading the eight-team league in what is known as 
the "serie selectiva," the prestige tournament of the several Cuba holds each 
year. Many players compete virtually all 12 months. The "selectiva" is the 
competition Cuban fans wait for. The winner of the 63-game season gets to play 
abroad and earns bug-eyed adulation from their fans. With fewer players, the 
calibre of play is higher than the 18-team national competition held between 
November and January. 
</P>
<P>
Borges, 43, likes the idea of having his players live under one roof. Last 
year, they all lived at home and the team played poorly, so poorly that the 
local Communist Party chapter sat down with the team for a pep talk. (This 
happens to other teams as well.) 
</P>
<P>
Borges says discipline is better this year and the record shows it. Still, he's 
antsy. The pressures on him are no less than those faced by Tom Lasorda or Don 
Zimmer. There's not much to do in Cuba, so people watch baseball and root hard. 
Morales, the baseball commissioner, says 72% of Cuban televisions are regularly 
tuned in to a game. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a one-time pitching prospect before making a career switch, likes the 
Santiago team from Cuba's east end. He was raised nearby and, besides, that is 
the city where the revolution began. 
</P>
<P>
Borges feels he and his team are constantly under the microscope. The 
"Girardillos," as his team is called, finished in second place four years in a 
row and it's been 15 years since Havana has won the "selectiva." The fans are 
getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular evening, the team dines together on pork chops at the sports 
complex and then boards the bus for the half hour ride to Latin American 
Stadium. As usual, Borges is nervous. The bus takes off behind schedule and he 
won't have time for the pregame meeting. Borges insists his players are nervous 
as well but the horseplay on the bus leaves a different impression. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's opponent is Las Villas, a team from the central part of the country, 
and Havana is gunning for a three-game sweep. From the dressing room, the 
Havana team (known officially as Ciudad Habana) heads for the field, descending 
cement steps that have been chipped away by player spikes since 1946 when this 
relic, unsullied by artificial turf, was built. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium seats 60,000 (some other playing fields in the league hold only 
12,000) but there is a homey atmosphere, with many seats close to the action. 
It has a charm that some of the astroturfed U.S. ballfields lack. 
</P>
<P>
There are relatively few private cars in Cuba so most fans walk to the park or 
take the bus. Shortly before gametime, with about 25,000 people in the stadium, 
about a third of the parking lot -- there are only about 150 spaces -- is 
filled. For the fans, the nice part is walking in and sitting down free of 
charge. The choicest seats are reserved for families of the players and VIP's. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is relaxed. Here at least, the totalitarian police state 
ambience that American conservatives fret about is missing. Blacks predominate 
in the stands and on the playing field. Fans are expected to return foul balls 
hit into the stands. About 10 to 15 balls are used per game, well below the 
major league average. 
</P>
<P>
A strapping right-hander, Lazaro Valle, only 19, has been picked to start for 
the home team. Borges says he's one of the three best pitchers in the league. 
Control would be his biggest problem tonight. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Girardillos are having few problems solving the Las Villas 
starter, Roberto Almarales, a slim righty. The home team, clad in blue and 
white, gets to him early.

ALL'S CALM SO FAR AS STUDENTS HIT BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SPRING BREAK: NO ARRESTS OR TROUBLE FROM THOSE ON VACATION IS REPORTED. MANY 
ENJOYING THE AMBIENCE AND SURF ARE AVOIDING NOTORIOUSLY WILD PALM SPRINGS.

<P>
Spring break got under way in Orange County on Saturday with a mild start as 
collegians surfed, sunned, shopped and hit the bars in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests or trouble from rowdy students was reported, according to police and 
lifeguards, in contrast with the activity in the longtime spring break mecca, 
Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the spring break visitors said they came to Orange County 
beachside communities specifically to avoid the rowdiness that has forced Palm 
Springs officials to crack down on celebrators. By nightfall Saturday, law 
enforcement officers in Palm Springs had made 139 arrests and issued 700 
citations, most of them related to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Foster, 25, was one student who came to Orange County in search of a placid 
vacation. The senior from College of the Desert, a junior college 15 minutes 
outside Palm Springs, said he left town to escape the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"Palm Springs locals have to either get out of town or stay in their houses," 
Foster said. "While the beach people invade the desert, the desert people 
invade the beach. There are too many people, too many cops" in Palm Springs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors from as far away as Maine came to the coast. Many of them, veterans of 
spring breaks elsewhere, said they prefer the docile ambience of Laguna Beach, 
Newport Beach and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to Daytona and Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.," said Lisa St. Claire, a UC 
Berkeley sophomore. "It's a lot more mellow here. Down here you can rage, but 
in a responsible way. In Palm Springs, everyone is getting arrested and getting 
into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she added, in Orange County "the men are all locals, and they're all 
gorgeous. If you go to any of the famous spring break places, they're all from 
Idaho and Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
Mutt Lynch's, a popular bar and restaurant in Newport Beach, was packed to 
capacity as students mixed with Newport residents to play pool and sip out of 
goblets that hold 2 1/2 cans of beer. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Collins, a senior from the University of Maine and a native of Boston, she 
said she liked the easygoing California demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"Why am I in Newport Beach on spring break?" Collins asked. "Because it's fun. 
This is the place to be. People here are so casual, laid back and friendly. The 
weather's great, but the people are greater." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hronek, 21, a junior from the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay, came to 
Orange County for something different. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to Florida for three years, but this is a lot better," Hronek said. 
"It's more exciting here. There are more interesting people -- they're weirder. 
They just do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, students shopped at stores on the shady streets of Balboa 
and tested waves one to two feet high. 
</P>
<P>
But cloudy skies and chilly temperatures discouraged large numbers of students 
from flocking to the beaches. About 25,000 spring-break visitors were expected 
at Newport Beach alone. But crowd estimates from Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, 
Huntington State and Bolsa Chica State beaches totaled just 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like a regular weekend day," said Christina O'Rourk, a dispatcher 
for Huntington State Beach. "You can't even tell it's spring break. We don't 
have vehicles waiting to get in. I think everyone is in Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Heur, 19, a sophomore from San Diego State University, and his friends 
specifically avoided going to Palm Springs. "In Palm Springs, they're kicking 
everybody out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Heur was "soaking up rays" through the clouds at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
His friend Jason, a 17-year-old high school student from Victorville, quaffed a 
beer just after bodysurfing. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had brought a Boogie Board I would have had a lot more fun," Savage said, 
his black hair dripping and his chest reddening with sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Sgt. John Freeman said that drinking on the beach is a 
violation of city code punishable by a fine and that underage drinking also 
breaks state laws on minors possessing alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a complete no-no," Freeman said. "We write a lot of alcohol tickets. 
If you have good ID and are not much of a problem, then you get away with only 
a ticket," which includes a court appearance and a fine. 
</P>
<P>
But laws against public drinking did not stop students from bringing beer to 
the beach. Jason and his friends kept their beer cans covered with beach towels 
as police and lifeguards passed. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Balboa Pier, Mark Marinko, 21, a junior from Cal State Sacramento, and 
his friends poured Coors beer into cups and drank them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sleeping here tonight. This is our house," he said, pointing to a beach 
blanket strewn with clothes, paper bags and sunglasses. "It's only got one 
bedroom, but it's OK."

PRESSING A DREAM TO PUBLISH IN VIETNAMESE; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: AN IMMIGRANT FULFILLS A DREAM BY BUILDING A PUBLISHING COMPANY THAT 
INFORMS AND ENTERTAINS HIS COUNTRYMEN IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born in a refugee's basement, a desktop publishing operation here has become 
the largest purveyor of Vietnamese-language books outside Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Using two rickety presses and low-tech collating and book-binding machines, the 
Xuan Thu press has since 1976 been churning out everything from ancient 
Vietnamese classics to modern kung fu novels -- the memoirs of generals and 
postwar prisoners, epic romances and English textbooks, cookbooks, dictionaries 
and children's books. 
</P>
<P>
Xuan Thu hawks more than 1,000 titles through a catalogue mailed to 22,000 
Vietnamese readers scattered from Northern California to New Jersey and from 
Paris to Melbourne, Australia. Profits are puny, however. A first edition 
typically consists of 500 copies. Anything over 2,000 copies counts as a 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
But Xuan Thu, and more than a dozen even smaller Vietnamese publishers in 
Orange County, San Jose, Washington, Toronto, Paris and Sydney, Australia, are 
virtually the last literary resort for more than 1 million Vietnamese who have 
left their homeland since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese-language books are difficult to come by. Anti-communist refugees 
here allege that after 1975, many books were confiscated, banned or censored by 
the Hanoi regime. Restrictions on publishing have been relaxed under doi moi, 
the recent policy of liberalization that is Vietnam's answer to glasnost, but 
publishers here say many are still laced with propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the love stories, they get some communism in there, so it's not 
acceptable to the community here," said Xuan Thu's owner, Pham. "Over there, 
they cannot even kiss. They just hold hands in front of a billboard of some 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
Technically, books published in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam may not be 
imported to the United States. However, several pro-Hanoi bookstores in 
Montreal do carry them and will ship them to Vietnamese-American readers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is the writers who have left the country who are producing the most 
vibrant works, said Do Dinh Tuan, who owns a Westminster bookstore and has 
published 12 new works since 1984 under the Van Khoa label. 
</P>
<P>
"Literature ceased to exist when the communists took over," Tuan said. "They 
had so many rules and restrictions that nobody could continue to write. Only 
refugees can write the truth," he claims. 
</P>
<P>
Though these new works are anything but apolitical -- the horrors of war, 
communism, prison camps and Thai pirates are central themes -- Xuan Thu Pham 
says he tries hard to steer clear of politics. 
</P>
<P>
An exceedingly shy man, he calls himself a "printer," not a publisher. He keeps 
his name out of print, and uses a post office box for his business, which is 
registered under a different name. He agreed to be interviewed on condition 
that he be identified only by one of his three names, a common one in 
Vietnamese. He declined to be photographed. 
</P>
<P>
Such precautions are perhaps not unreasonable. In California since 1987, two 
Vietnamese-American newspaper publishers have been hit by arson, one of which 
was a fatal fire, and two internationally known authors were attacked and 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Pham published the novels of one of the victims. Long Vu, who lives in Paris, 
had written 20 books as well as columns critical of both the former South 
Vietnamese and the current communist governments. He was severely beaten during 
a trip to Westminster's Little Saigon last year. He was left partially 
paralyzed and brain-damaged, and will never write again, said Pham. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Vietnamese groups were suspected in Vu's beating and in several 
other attacks. "I don't have any problems with papers and machines and books," 
Pham said. "I enjoy having books around me. With people, you have problems." 
</P>
<P>
Pham said his mission is to preserve his country's literature and to remind 
fellow refugees of the pleasures and comforts of their native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
It is an unlikely calling for a man who began his career writing tax laws in 
the South Vietnamese Ministry of Finance, became a soldier, and, after fleeing 
South Vietnam aboard a U.S. helicopter in 1975, did stints as a dishwasher, an 
assistant cook and the manager of a McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
It was while he was working as a janitor in Lancaster, Pa., that he confided 
his publishing dreams to a friend, a banker from an Amish family. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no money, no credit, no collateral, nothing," Pham said. "He lent me 
$25,000. It was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Pham and his wife installed a simple press in their basement in 
Lancaster. The first book they published was a love story -- the only book they 
had brought with them when they fled Vietnam. It took them two months to print 
300 copies. 
</P>
<P>
They sold it in markets in Philadelphia and Washington, but it did not do well. 
Nor did their second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"After three years, I still couldn't sell enough books to get money to buy 
paper, so I wanted to quit," Pham said. "But I still owed about $18,000 to the 
bank so I couldn't quit. . . . I tried to sell the press but I couldn't sell 
it. So I had to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
Pham now believes that in the early years, Vietnamese refugees were too 
preoccupied with finding jobs, homes and lost relatives to have time to read, 
let alone to tackle the weighty works he was printing. And his customers were 
isolated in tiny communities throughout the United States, Europe and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
While Pham was having trouble finding readers, writers could not find him. 
</P>
<P>
Ngoc Ngan Nguyen, a Toronto-based novelist who wrote his first book in a 
Malaysian refugee camp, now writes for Xuan Thu and at least six other 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
But when he first arrived in 1979, Nguyen said, "I wanted to get in touch with 
a Vietnamese publishing company, and there weren't any. So I couldn't get my 
book published. And I was so depressed." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen decided to learn to write in English instead. His memoirs, "The Will of 
Heaven," were published by E.P. Dutton in 1982. He has since published 13 more 
books in Vietnamese, published by Xuan Thu, Van Khoa and a half-dozen other 
companies. And he has achieved star status by selling 5,000 copies apiece. 
</P>
<P>
For Xuan Thu, the big break came in 1981. By this time, a national Vietnamese 
magazine had started, and Pham placed an ad. Then a friend suggested that after 
long, hard days working two jobs, his immigrant clientele might appreciate some 
lighter reading. Pham printed a kung fu novel. It sold 500 copies -- a relative 
smash. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Pham learned that Houston was sprouting a large Vietnamese community, 
and moved his business there. When the economy soured, he decided that Orange 
County had become the real center of overseas Vietnamese culture. Besides, he 
liked the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Xuan Thu opened its doors in a vastly overcrowded warehouse in the middle of a 
strawberry field in 1985. It now has seven employees, including Pham, and 
annual sales of more than $150,000 to mail-order customers, about 100 
bookstores worldwide and libraries, Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of its titles are reprints of works published in old Saigon, many 
of them borrowed from the Asian Library at Cornell University. Pham 
painstakingly reproduces the original art and type from these tattered volumes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, we use the same covers, because our people, they live with their 
memories," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Xuan Thu's two presses were clacking out copies of what may be a 
Vietnamese "Papillion." It is the story of former South Vietnamese air force 
pilot Ly Tong, who claimed to have escaped from three communist prisons, then 
walked, swam, hitchhiked, bicycled and rode trains and buses a total of 1,560 
miles. He finally arrived at the door of the U.S. Embassy in Singapore in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
His exploits were chronicled in the Reader's Digest, but Xuan Thu has secured 
Tong's Vietnamese manuscript -- all 600 pages. 
</P>
<P>
"This one, we print 1,000 copies," said Pham. "I know it will sell. . . ." He 
plans an oversized paperback edition that will sell for $15 or $16. 
</P>
<P>
Such successes, however, finance editions of children's books. These invariably 
lose money, Pham said, but he hopes they will keep Vietnamese youngsters from 
forgetting their ancestral tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Later this spring, Xuan Thu plans to release the autobiography of former 
Vietnamese emperor Bao Dai, now 76 and living in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese never knew about his life," Pham explained. "They thought he was 
just a puppet. But in this book, we see that he fought a lot for the rights of 
the people. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why the French kicked him out."

Ready to exercise? OK, flex that left frontal lobe! Stretch that gray matter! 
C'mon, work that cerebellum! 
</P>
<P>
How else would you expect an academic decathlon team to work out for a 
championship? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it doesn't sound quite like that when the state champion Laguna Hills 
High School academic decathlon team meets to prepare for the upcoming national 
championships in Des Moines. But the team's preparations are something like 
brain calisthenics. 
</P>
<P>
From now until the start of the grueling three-day national competition on 
April 20, the nine-student Laguna Hills team -- which bested 46 other high 
schools March 10 to take the state championship -- will be studying almost 
nonstop in a bid to be crowned the smartest teens in America. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the team's preparation consists simply of cramming as much information 
as possible into their heads during marathon study sessions, which coach Kathy 
Lane said can last up to four hours a day before the event. Lane and the team's 
other coach, Roger Gunderson, will also get the team ready for the contest with 
a series of tests and drills, throwing out questions at random. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the theme of 'The Great Gatsby?' " Gunderson barked out at a recent 
team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
With little hesitation, senior student Mike Lee, 17, responded: "Gatsby's 
desire to recapture the past." 
</P>
<P>
At the study session, the students also quizzed each other in their specialty 
-- American Indian history, the subject that helped earn them the state title 
-- and in other subjects, using textbooks and loose-leaf notebooks so large 
that they could have held designs for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the enormous volume of information they memorize, the three juniors 
and six seniors on the team are no more intimidated by the championship than 
they would be about a pop quiz, if their attitude and demeanor is an 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends are more excited that I am, really," Jay Kim, 16, a junior, said at 
a recent team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our parents are ecstatic," added team captain Jeff McCombs, 18, a senior. "My 
parents are more excited than me." 
</P>
<P>
After all, it's not as if the team hasn't won before. The school has won the 
Orange County competition for four years running. In this year's contest, as 
McCombs proudly pointed out, at the junior-senior level, "we had the largest 
margin of victory ever -- 3,700 points." 
</P>
<P>
And at the state championship in Bakersfield, Laguna Hills scored 45,361 
points. The closest of the also-rans, El Camino High, fell 572 points short. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those performances, Laguna Hills -- the first team from Orange County 
to win the state championship in 11 years -- has been ranked second in the 
nation. "Texas is ranked No. 1 in the country," McCombs said. 
</P>
<P>
But Julian Kingston, 17, quickly chimed in: "They're not going to be ranked No. 
1 for long!" 
</P>
<P>
Jeff DeWit, a 17-year-old senior, added that the team does not feel at all 
intimidated by the team from Texas or any of the other participants. "In every 
competition, we've been a first-place team," he said. "I think we're the ones 
intimidating other people." 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson and Lane, who have put in hundreds of extracurricular hours to 
prepare the team for the championships, were also confident in their team. 
"They have the will, spirit and determination to win," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so everybody's confident. But doesn't the team fear the national exposure 
or the expectations of parents or the burden of upholding the school tradition 
of championship academic decathlon teams? 
</P>
<P>
"I think we thrive on pressure," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Kim should enjoy the national championship, because there will be 
no shortage of pressure. The first day of the brain-bending competition starts 
with an essay-writing contest, followed by personal interviews in which 
students are judged by their off-the-cuff answers. 
</P>
<P>
Kim predicted that he will do well in the interview segment, even though 
there's no way to prepare for it. The judges "ask questions about your 
activities, your future plans, your character, your personality," Kim said. 
"They can ask you anything." 
</P>
<P>
The interview segment is followed by a speech competition, in which contestants 
are judged on their oratory. 
</P>
<P>
The second day begins with morning-long testing in social science, science, 
mathematics, economics, language, literature and fine arts. The competition 
ends with a high-pressure "super quiz," a two-hour question session in which 
teams compete against each other. Day Three is devoted to awards presentations. 
</P>
<P>
The team is grouped into three levels, based on grade-point average. McCombs, 
Kim and junior Ryan Sakamoto, 16, are in the "A" group. The "B" group consists 
of Lee, junior Todd Faurot, 16, and senior Jack Dietz, 17. Kingston, DeWit and 
senior Bill Fischer, 17, are in the "C" group. No girls signed up for the team 
this year, though girls have competed on previous Laguna Hills teams. 
</P>
<P>
The team is confident because each member is skilled in different disciplines. 
For example, Faurot excels in fine arts -- "He's one of the best piano players 
I've ever seen," Kim said -- while Lee does best in the super quiz segment and 
essay writing, in which he was ranked first in the state. DeWit said he is best 
in the speech competition, while Dietz boasts medals from the state competition 
in math and science. 
</P>
<P>
Faurot said the whole team takes advantage of cumulative knowledge through 
question-and-answer drills and testing. 
</P>
<P>
"What one person knows, everybody should know," he said. "The biggest reason 
for our success is we put the team ahead of ourselves."

SHOOTING, STANDOFF FOLLOWS COSTA MESA WOMEN'S FISTFIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
What began as an early-morning fistfight between two roommates who met in 
prison took a bizarre twist Saturday when one woman accidentally shot herself 
in the leg and then, toting a semiautomatic rifle, climbed up to the chimney 
where she held police at bay for more than two hours before giving up. 
</P>
<P>
Both women were arrested, then taken to different area hospitals to be treated 
for injuries, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary Webster said. Police identified the 
women as Darlene M. Marks, 25, and Sandra Sue Bird, 29, both of whom had been 
living with Marks' elderly step-grandfather at his Costa Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were first called to the quiet neighborhood of well-kept, 
single-family homes just after 2 a.m. by a neighbor who reported seeing two 
women in a savage fistfight on their front lawn. When police arrived at the 
home in the 2300 block of Rutgers Drive, Marks told officers that Bird had shot 
herself in the leg during a "quick-draw" accident. Bird had left the premises, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
A bloodied Marks was taken to College Hospital Costa Mesa for medical 
attention, then arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of 
narcotics, police said. But the disturbance was far from over. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, police said, they received a phone call from someone in the 
house where the women lived. Bird had returned, the caller said, and was 
threating to kill the occupants of the house and any police officers who 
approached her. 
</P>
<P>
"They (police) asked me to leave and get out of the way because they thought 
there might be some shooting going on," said Jay Huffman, 89, Marks' 
step-grandfather. When police arrived, Webster said, Bird climbed up to the 
roof with a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, 30 rounds of ammunition and hid 
between the chimney and an overhanging tree, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight police cars surrounded the house, blocked off the street and 
alerted bleary-eyed neighbors. The SWAT team was alerted but was not dispatched 
to the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The police rapped on my door and said to stay on one side of the house," said 
one neighbor who did not want to be identified. "I was scared stiff." 
</P>
<P>
After 2 1/2 hours, police said, Bird left the gun on the roof and jumped into 
the back yard, where she was arrested on charges of confronting an officer with 
a weapon. She was taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach for treatment of the 
gunshot wound in her leg and for psychiatric observation. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, 89, blamed the incident on his step-granddaughter's involvement with 
drugs. "It's all behind those drugs," he said, standing in his driveway, which 
was still stained with drops of blood. "Whiskey is bad but drugs are worse." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said Marks had met Bird while the two were in prison, but he could not 
say what they served time for.

POLICE SEEKING WOULD-BE RAPIST LEFT BLOODIED AND BITTEN BY MAID

Police said Saturday that they are looking for a man who tried to rape a motel 
maid but was injured as the victim fought him off. 
</P>
<P>
The maid, described as small by acquaintances, bit the man's bottom lip and 
part of his goatee off, and also left bite marks over his upper body and 
scratches across his face. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital emergency rooms throughout Southern California have been alerted, but 
so far a suspect has not appeared, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's fine. She wasn't hurt at all," said a fellow employee at the motel on 
Manchester Avenue on Saturday. "She acted very bravely, and we're very proud of 
her." 
</P>
<P>
The maid, however, remains upset by the Monday morning attack and is no longer 
working alone, an employee said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the woman, 24, was working in a room at about 11 a.m. when 
a man entered. Police described him as a Latino, 30 to 35 years old, 5 feet, 6 
inches tall and weighing about 160 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
After the assailant attacked her, "he must have thought he'd gotten in a cave 
with a tiger," one officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Saturday that if found, the man will be arrested on suspicion of 
attempted rape.

GOP'S FRANK HILL RUNS IN SAFE TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been a little more than three months since Gov. George Deukmejian 
scheduled a special election to replace veteran state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights) and set off a vicious primary battle in which the 
campaigns of eight candidates combined to spend about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, voters in the 31st Senate District will go to the polls in a runoff 
to choose among the three survivors of the primary battle in February. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), the Republican nominee, is the favorite to 
win, largely because the seat is in the third most heavily Republican Senate 
district in California. Republicans hold a registration advantage of about 54% 
to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is opposed by Democrat Janice Graham and American Independent Party 
candidate Robert Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The district straddles the boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties and 
stretches from Whittier and West Covina in the north to Laguna Beach in the 
south. It also includes part of Brea and Placentia, as well as Yorba Linda, El 
Toro and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the campaign strategy for almost all of Hill's opponents has 
been to attack the Whittier assemblyman on two issues -- abortion and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who defeated two other Democrats in the Feb. 6 primary, recently 
produced her only mailer for the general election campaign -- an eight-page 
attack on Hill. The mailer focused on Hill's connection to a federal 
influence-peddling investigation in Sacramento that resulted in FBI agents 
raiding his office more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
But Graham's mailer is filled with headlines, such as, "The FBI has Frank Hill 
on tape selling his vote for $5,000" and "We have to stop Frank Hill now -- 
before he becomes State Senator Frank Hill." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, 53, a former schoolteacher from Laguna Hills and the 1988 challenger to 
Campbell, has also campaigned on her support of abortion rights, highlighting 
Hill's opposition to unrestricted abortion. 
</P>
<P>
She had hoped that the FBI investigation and the recent political attention 
given to abortion would cause state leaders and organizations to throw their 
support behind her campaign against Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Some California Democrats consider that race "unwinnable." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, meanwhile, has largely campaigned on his eight-year record in the 
Assembly and the support he has received from state Republican leaders, 
including campaign appearances from Deukmejian and Sen. Pete Wilson. Literature 
mailed to the district also highlights his local roots. 
</P>
<P>
One cover pictures the governor and senator with the headline: "Why are George 
Deukmejian and Pete Wilson working so hard to elect Frank Hill to the state 
Senate?" 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 36, grew up in Diamond Bar, graduated from Rowland High School, and 
attended Mount San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who narrowly defeated Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) in the 
February primary, said he plans to spend more than $1 million in the race. 
Graham, meanwhile, reported recently that she has raised a little more than 
$28,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who ran unsuccessfully for the 69th Assembly District seat in 1976, 
supports existing abortion laws, saying, "I don't want the government getting 
anywhere near my family's matters." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Washington, Lewis attended Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration officials said the polls throughout the district will be 
open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald 
Tanney predicted an 18% turnout for the race, about average for a special 
election.

WILSON LAUDS RESOLUTION OF BOLSA CHICA DEADLOCK 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describing efforts to preserve the Bolsa Chica wetlands as the "largest 
proposed restoration project of wetlands in the country," Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) heaped praise on a local coalition Saturday for plans to protect the 
environmentally sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
The senator, who is running for governor, made his remarks before about 60 
people gathered on a bluff overlooking the scenic marsh, across the street from 
a gated, oceanside development. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look back and this will serve as a source of pride for you," Wilson 
said. "Without your efforts, this would not have come about." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica became the focus of national attention in February, when a huge oil 
spill from the American Trader spewed black goo onto the shore at Huntington 
Beach and Newport Beach. The spill raised fears that the oil would reach Bolsa 
Chica, a prime nesting habitat for dozens of birds, including least terns and 
light-footed clapper rails, both endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and Signal Landmark, owner of the Bolsa Chica bog, have 
feuded for decades over the fate of the historic salt-and-freshwater marsh on 
the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway, between Warner Avenue and Golden West 
Street. A breakthrough finally came last year when Signal Landmark agreed to a 
compromise calling for keeping 1,100 of the 1,635 acres as undeveloped 
wetlands. This was a significant reduction from the firm's original proposal 
calling for a much denser development that would have included a 1,400-acre 
resort and marina and 5,700 homes on 412 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think that the conflict between environmentalists and 
developers is an unbridgeable" gap, Wilson told the audience of 
environmentalists, local officials and representatives from Signal Landmark. 
"But you have proved that wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Although the compromise was hammered out last year, Signal Landmark only 
recently announced plans to apply for federal permits needed to put the lengthy 
process in motion. Signal Landmark has also asked the City Council to annex the 
wetlands before preservation work begins. The council is scheduled to discuss 
that request April 16. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson won praise from local officials and environmentalists, who credited his 
efforts for helping to bring about the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson is a true amigo of Bolsa Chica," Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. 
Mays said. "With the oil spill that affected the city here and Newport Beach, 
it is very important for coastal cities to work to preserve their natural 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, also on hand for the ceremony, said the proposed 
compromise goes a long way toward achieving that goal.

KELLY CALLS SALVOS OF FOES 'CHEAP SLIME' AS CITY COUNCIL CONTEST HEATS UP

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the City Council election has cleared lengthy legal hurdles and will 
be held Tuesday, some campaign forces have come out swinging, and most of the 
last-minute round of mudslinging is aimed at incumbent John Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been campaigning in Tustin for a decade, and I've never seen the cheap 
slime that these desperate candidates are generating," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
He has been criticized in anonymous campaign flyers and posters that have 
recently appeared on trash cans and telephone poles in the Old Town area, where 
he runs a family-owned tuxedo shop. Because the flyers were posted rather than 
mailed, the Political Reform Act does not require that they carry 
identification, a state Fair Political Practices Commission spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Kelly forces have also cited, among other things, two-year-old internal 
police documents that accuse Kelly and Councilman Earl J. Prescott, his 
political ally, of harassing precinct workers on the night of an election in 
November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has said no impropriety occurred, pointing out that he and Prescott were 
never arrested or issued citations. But leaders of the Tustin Residents Action 
Committee insist that the documents, obtained through a public-records request, 
show an abuse of power and unprofessional conduct by the councilmen. 
</P>
<P>
TRAC, which is led by presidents of the city's powerful homeowners 
associations, has vowed to oust Kelly and endorsed three other candidates: 
Leslie Ann Pontious, Charles E. (Chuck) Puckett and Jim Potts. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Prescott said a city employee must have leaked the existence of the 
police accusations to TRAC. The group's chairman, Carl Kasalek, denied the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, TRAC began distributing a flyer entitled "Tustin Tomorrow," in 
which the group asks, "What happens if John Kelly wins?" The flyer criticizes 
past Kelly actions, including his opposition to a redevelopment project, his 
taping of a conversation with a city staff member and his run for Congress 
during his first council term. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five of the candidates -- Puckett, Pontious, Potts, Dennie E. 
Pederson and John Norman Butler -- have declared that returning respectability 
and order to the City Council is the No. 1 campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates all said they want to alleviate traffic, reduce crime and 
maintain the quality of life in Tustin. However, some issues split them into 
two camps. While Kelly, Carole Bryant and Berklee A. Maughan would opt to move 
City Council elections to November and reduce the power of city staff members, 
the other candidates disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, when a Superior Court decision cleared the way for Tuesday's 
election, the vote remained uncertain. Kelly and Prescott filed two 
unsuccessful lawsuits, alleging that the ordinance was invalid on the grounds 
that former Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey was not a resident of Tustin when he 
voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
There are five candidates vying for two four-year terms: 
</P>
<P>
* Kelly, 28, the only incumbent. In his first reelection bid, Kelly is 
advocating a change in council leadership and has pledged to fight taxes and 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Puckett, 47, district sales manager for Beatrice-Hunt/Wesson and former 
planning commissioner. Puckett, who ran unsuccessfully for the council in 1982 
and 1988, said he wants to fight traffic and expand the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
* Bryant, 41, an accountant and owner of a manufacturing company. She calls for 
strengthing police and solving traffic problems, which she links in great part 
with car-pool lanes on freeways. 
</P>
<P>
* Pederson, 42, construction manager for Northrop Electronics Systems Division. 
Pederson said he would try to keep the city's growth and expansion at a slow 
and steady pace. 
</P>
<P>
* Pontious, 44, co-owner of a Tustin travel agency and former planning 
commissioner. Pontious said she wants to encourage redevelopment projects to 
raise money for the city and help pay for important road projects. 
</P>
<P>
There are three candidates competing for a two-year term left vacant by 
Hoesterey's resignation: 
</P>
<P>
* Butler, 34, a real estate broker, wants to try to alleviate traffic 
congestion by routing traffic around the city rather than through it. 
</P>
<P>
* Maughan, 52, a retired financial executive, wants to see more everyday 
involvement by residents and less power for the city manager and city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
* Potts, 37, a business owner and sergeant with the Irvine Police Department, 
would work toward a moratorium on high-density building, start citywide 
recycling and build more bicycle and jogging trails.

21 RBIs in 98 games. 
</P>
<P>
Comments: Right-handed hitter who once was tabbed as the replacement for 
Philadelphia third baseman Mike Schmidt. Can play third base, outfield and has 
been working out as a catcher. Schu does not hit for power, but is considered a 
good contact hitter.

SCOTT BAILES 
</P>
<P>
Age: 27 
</P>
<P>
Position: Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
Major league experience: Four years 
</P>
<P>
How obtained: Acquired from Cleveland in exchange for infielder Jeff Manto and 
pitcher Colin Charland, Jan. 9, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Pertinent stats: Has a career 31-41 record and 4.70 earned-run average in four 
seasons at Cleveland, where he was a starter and reliever. 
</P>
<P>
Comments: If Bailes can pitch against other teams the way he pitched against 
the Angels last season, the left-hander will be a valuable addition. Bailes 
struggled against most opponents, but had little trouble with the Angels, 
allowing one earned run and striking out eight in 13 innings for a 2-0 record. 
General Manager Mike Port says Bailes, primarily a fastball-curveball pitcher, 
has shown flashes of brilliance this spring, but he needs to become more 
consistent. It appears his role will be middle to long relief.

MARK EICHHORN 
</P>
<P>
Age: 29 
</P>
<P>
Position: Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
Major league experience: Three years, 112 days 
</P>
<P>
How obtained: Signed as free agent, Dec. 19, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pertinent stats: Was successful at triple-A Richmond last season, going 1-0 
with a 1.32 ERA and 19 saves, but struggled at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Comments: Eichhorn has had a history of shoulder problems but when healthy, the 
right-hander who has a side arm, Kent Tekulve-like delivery, can be effective 
against right-handed hitters. He had two good seasons at Toronto in 1986 and 
'87 but has spent most of his 11-year professional career in the minor leagues. 
He will be used as a set-up man in late-inning situations.

MARK LANGSTON 
</P>
<P>
Age: 29 
</P>
<P>
Position: Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
Major league experience: Six years 
</P>
<P>
How obtained: Signed as free agent, Dec. 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pertinent stats: Went a combined 16-14 in 1989 with Seattle and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Led the American League in strikeouts in 1984, 1986 and 1987. Signed a 
five-year, $16-million contract with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Comments: Considered baseball's premier free agent last fall, Langston's 
presence has given the Angels a surplus of quality starters. The left-hander is 
best known for his fastball, which has helped him strike out at least 200 in 
five of the last six seasons, but he also can be effective with a variety of 
breaking and offspeed pitches. Langston has had a tendency to give up the long 
ball -- he allowed 30 or more home runs a season from 1986-88 -- but many came 
inside Seattle's cozy Kingdome. His earned-run average has improved in each of 
the last four seasons, from 5.47 to 4.85, 3.84, 3.34 and 2.74, and he has 
proven a durable commodity. He has been on the disabled list just once in six 
years.

I was deeply touched by the March 13 episode of "Who's the Boss?," especially 
the scene in which Mona is in the hospital and her deceased husband appears, 
telling her of his love and that "he is always with her." I recently lost my 
husband of 42 years and those were his last words to me before passing away. My 
compliments to the writers for such sensitivity and to Katherine Helmond for 
her warm portrayal.

<TEXT>
<P>
James Toback's 1983 Exposed (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a drenchingly 
romantic thriller lots stronger in style than credibility in which an ambiguous 
angel of death (Nastassja Kinski) captivates a concert violinist (Rudolf 
Nureyev) and also a Paris-based terrorist (Harvey Keitel). 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 Annie Hall (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is landmark Woody Allen, a 
declaration of maturity and a witty semi-autobiographical romance in which he 
stars with Diane Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
The new TV movie Crossing to Freedom (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a World War II 
drama starring Peter O'Toole as a reluctant hero intent on leading a band of 
French children to safety in England. 
</P>
<P>
Twin Peaks (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the new David Lynch TV movie, which 
launches the series of the same name and lays bare the dark underside of a 
small Pacific Northwestern town. 
</P>
<P>
King of the Gypsies (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) brought Peter Maas' 
engrossing 1978 multi-generational saga to the screen in synthetic, all-star 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Capital News (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie/series pilot set in a 
Washington newspaper and starring Lloyd Bridges and Helen Slater. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 That Was Then, This Is Now (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a sincere 
film about two delinquents starring Craig Sheffer and Emilio Estevez (the 
latter adapted the script from an S. E. Hinton novel). 
</P>
<P>
Forbidden Nights (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Melissa 
Gilbert and based on American teacher Judith Shapiro's experiences in China. 
</P>
<P>
Switching Channels (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), that frenetic, misfired 
1988 attempt to update "The Front Page" to the cable business, traps Kathleen 
Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve in an enervating, joyless endurance 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Julien Temple's Earth Girls Are Easy (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a 
jazzy, snazzy 1988 rock musical about a dumped-on Valley Girl (Geena Davis) who 
ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials (Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, Damon 
Wayans) around town after they crash-land in her swimming pool. Fluff, but fun. 
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner, 
traces the parallel lives of two very different British athletes who competed 
in the 1924 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Break of Dawn (Channel 28 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is an awkward yet moving 
biography of Pedro Gonzalez (Oscar Chavez), a Mexican singer who became an 
influential recording and radio star whose career ran afoul of corrupt, 
exploitative Anglo politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Stick (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) took a gem of an Elmore Leonard 
novel and turned it into a mediocre Burt Reynolds vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Like all anthology comedies, the 1987 Amazon Women on the Moon (Channel 5 
Friday at 8 p.m.) is a hit-and-miss affair, with the hits outweighing the 
misses to yield an amiable enough diversion. 
</P>
<P>
Reckless (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a shallow, irresponsible 1984 
feature teaming then newcomer Aidan Quinn as a small-town Brando-Dean type 
entangled with bored rich girl Daryl Hannah.

The simulated version of "The Terry Anderson Story" shown March 10 on "Saturday 
Night With Connie Chung" employed a technique that was entirely out of place 
for the theme -- the plight of the American hostages in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The theme is so strong and so heart-rending that any theatrics imposed on this 
story can only be in poor taste. It was a disservice to our hostages to treat 
their story in such melodramatic style. Moreover, the acting was a sham and the 
notion that news can be so manipulated is disgraceful.

Since I do not have children, I seldom watch the Charlie Brown TV specials. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, however, I read in the newspaper of the unique nature of the show 
aired on March 16, "Why, Charlie Brown, Why?" And special it was indeed! How 
thankful I am that I did not miss it. The sensitivity, compassion and 
tenderness conveyed through the story of little Janice, the leukemia patient, 
was almost overwhelming. I found myself falling in love with these characters 
and am not at all embarrassed to admit that they moved me to tears. 
</P>
<P>
This was a shining example of television at its finest and is one program that 
should be replayed many times.

EASY RIDER 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, it transcended the biker genre with the extraordinary perspective it 
brought to its depiction of a couple of hippie types (Peter Fonda and Dennis 
Hopper) on a collision course with reactionary America. Dominating is Jack 
Nicholson's alcoholic lawyer.

ANOTHER WOMAN 
</P>
<P>
One can regret a virtual total absence of humor in this 1988 Woody Allen film 
and still be beguiled by it. At its center is Gena Rowlands as a successful 
professional woman of 50, who is at last confronted with the truth that she has 
distanced herself from her emotions all her life. Sandy Dennis is especially 
memorable amid a huge, typically distinguished Allen cast. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. Showtime

<P>
SUNDAY, BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
Written by Penelope Gilliat, this 1971 film remains among director John 
Schlesinger's very best. It offers a witty, detached-yet-compassionate view of 
a successful middle-aged London physician (Peter Finch) and Glenda Jackson as 
his wry, younger, less affluent rival for the affections of handsome Murray 
Head, who professes to love them both.

THE EMIGRANTS 
</P>
<P>
One of the most profoundly touching celebrations of the American experience is, 
in fact, this 1971 Jan Troell film drawn from the first two of Vilhelm Moberg's 
quartet of novels about the massive migration of Swedish farm families to the 
United States in the middle of the 19th Century. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann 
star in this surpassingly fine film.

THE NEW LAND 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 sequel to "The Emigrants" has less impact than the original-it hasn't 
itstsimple, straight-line narrative thrust of family and friends deciding to 
leave Sweden to try to build a new life in America-but it is still toweringly 
impressive as Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann settle down to their northern 
Minnesota homestead.

A WORLD APART 
</P>
<P>
A haunting, deeply moving film of conscience and consequence, this 1988 release 
is really about two separated worlds, one huge, one intimately small: black 
Africa and anti-apartheid activiit Diana Roth's all-female household. Told with 
an empathy strengthened by director Chris Menges' refusal to sentimentalize his 
characters, it's an autobiographical story by screenwriter Shawn Slovo, whose 
mother became the first white woman to be jailed (in 1963) under South Africa's 
90-day detention act. As Roth, Barbara Hershey brings her own warmth to a 
sometimes difficult woman, who neglected her children in her intense political 
commitments.

COMPARING THE 43-INCH SONY AND 70-INCH MITSUBISHI

Forty thousand dollars for a TV set? Honest. And, no, it's not made of gold and 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Sony PV-4300, featuring a 43-inch tube-the largest and most expensive 
direct-view (tube) TV on the market. Before Sony recently made this one 
available to consumers, the largest picture tube available was 35 inches, 
selling for at least $2,500 in sets made by companies including Zenith, JVC and 
Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the big-screen Sony is so expensive, explained Jim Palumbo, 
president of Sony's Consumer Display Products Co., is that the few on the 
market are handmade. He said the company has no immediate plans to put it in 
mass production, which would significantly lower the price. But that price 
hasn't been a deterrent to at least three people. Palumbo said Sony has sold 
three of the PVM-4300s so far. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, for a mere $6,000, Mitsubishi offers the largest 
rear-projection TV on the market, the 70-inch VS-700 2R. Mitsubishi makes 
rear-projection TVs with 100-inch and 120-inch screens, but they don't have 
cabinets and require custom installation. 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it, Sony's PV-4300 and the Mitsubishi VS-700 2R are side by 
side at Rogersound Labs in Santa Monica. The Sony unit is available in Southern 
California only at that Rogersound Labs and at Circuit City in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This comparison setup was an opportunity to match the biggest direct-view TV 
versus the largest rear-projection TV. In terms of brightness, clarity and 
sharpness of color, the Sony, a digitally enhanced set known as improved 
definition TV (IDTV), is the easy winner. 
</P>
<P>
But this was no surprise, since direct-view sets, with their relatively small 
screens, always offer a better picture than do sprawling rear-projection sets, 
which sacrifice clarity for size. 
</P>
<P>
Though it can't quite match the quality of picture on the giant-tube Sony, the 
rear-projection Mitsubishi does offer a surprisingly good picture. If you sit 
in the viewing seat set about eight feet directly in front the screen, you can 
see the optimal picture the set delivers. Up closer or looking at the screen 
from different angles, though, you see the fuzziness surrounding the images. 
</P>
<P>
But getting close to the Sony didn't make the picture seem any less excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Still, compared to the common rear-projection picture of a year or two ago, the 
Mitsubishi shows there's been a marked improvement in this kind of TV set. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of sound, both are equipped with Dolby Surround sound. The Sony sound 
seemed sharper, particularly the highs, but the Mitsubishi's sound was still of 
high quality. 
</P>
<P>
In screen size, of course, the Mitsubishi was naturally superior. Companies 
manufacturing big rear-projection sets count on the fact that the upscale 
customers who can afford them prize size over picture clarity and color 
sharpness. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers have speculated that the marketing of this 43-inch set 
indicates that in the near future, Sony may introduce a mass-produced line of 
sets with screen-size somewhere between the big one and the 35-inchers. 
Palumbo, though, said right now Sony has no such plans.

AND NOW, ZSA ZSA THE VIDEO

<P>
Poor Zsa Zsa Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
She makes that dreadful error of slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after 
being charged with a variety of small crimes against society (operating a 
vehicle without a valid driver's license and having an open container of 
alcohol on the seat). 
</P>
<P>
The result was a media circus that turned Zsa Zsa into one long and obnoxious 
joke, laughed at during news broadcasts, daytime talk shows and late-night 
comedy programs. It was one of the low points of modern journalism. Watching 
local newscasters guffawing aloud about Gabor was degrading to all concerned. 
The Gabor jokes rank among the cheapest shots ever taken by such usually clever 
folks as Jay Leno, Johnny Carson, Bryant Gumbel and Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
If that wasn't enough, here comes "The People vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor," a 60-minute 
grab-bag home video that the producers swear was not "approved or endorsed by 
Zsa Zsa Gabor." This video hodgepodge of courtroom testimony, TV news footage, 
person-on-the-street comments and an unctuous voice-over narration is a hurried 
mess. Much of the video is dreadful, and the sound quality is often worse, 
especially during Gabor's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants a newsy look at what happened to Zsa Zsa will find it here. 
There are no perspectives or thoughtful commentaries. No analysis by Zsa 
Zsa-her sentence included a two-year gag order; she can't say anything about 
the case, even if she wanted to. If you saw much of the massive news coverage 
and snide asides, then the only piece of this video that might interest you is 
the blowup of Gabor's altered driver's license. The changes are so obvious that 
they are laughable; it is as if a child's scrawl had changed the birth date, 
height and weight on the card. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still interested, the tape is produced by IVP/Tri-Coast International 
at 1020 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, Calif. 90405. A standard-play VHS version 
costs $14.95. A long-play VHS version is available at $9.95 and is almost 
unviewable. 
</P>
<P>
VIDEO RESCUES MADE-FOR-TV MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Some of the finest motion pictures ever made used to play once on prime-time TV 
and then disappear, except for the occasional rerun and foreign theatrical 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
Home video has changed all of that. Many made-for-television movies now are 
being released on videocassette and disc. One of the best, the 1989 "Roe vs. 
Wade" is now available on Paramount tape (no list price). 
</P>
<P>
This 92-minute docudrama, based on the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision declaring a Texas anti-abortion law unconstitutional, is an 
intelligent piece of work dramatizing the major issues of a highly 
controversial subject. There are no villains, just flesh-and-blood characters 
played with dignity and affection. Allison Cross' script, Gregory Hoblit's 
direction and the lead actors (Holly Hunter as "Jane Roe" and Amy Madigan as 
pro-choice Portia) breathe life into various elements of a social issue now 
ripping the country. 
</P>
<P>
There are no caricatures or oversimplifications. This is the kind of rare 
film-making that makes it easier to understand the complexities involved in a 
very complicated subject. 
</P>
<P>
Made-for-TV movies and miniseries, such as "The Autobiography of Miss Jane 
Pittman," "Blind Ambition" and "War and Remembrance," deserve more viewing than 
one or two showings on prime-time television. They deserve the availability 
that home video can give them.

COVER STORY: THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE;

<P>
JOE GARAGIOLA'S TIPS FOR WATCHING BASEBALL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vin Scully, the Walt Whitman of the baseball broadcast booth, has been known to 
describe the afternoon sky above a ballpark as "azure blue with pewter gray 
clouds." Joe Garagiola, the former catcher for the Cardinals, Pirates, Cubs and 
New York Giants, will look at that same sky and say, "I'm glad the clouds are 
there today, because they will help in seeing the pop flies." 
</P>
<P>
Whether you see baseball through the eyes of a poet or a player, the sky, 
Garagiola says, is just one of many signs and signals connoisseurs of the game 
will want to observe-even when watching on television. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, TV viewers are prisoners of the pictures the director and producer 
decide to show. If you want to see how the Dodger outfield is positioned to 
play Darryl Strawberry in the late innings of a close game, but the screen is 
filled with the svelte figure of Tommy Lasorda scratching his head in the 
dugout, too bad. Yet even with the inherent restrictions of television, 
Garagiola, who on Tuesday will begin his first season as the color man for the 
35 Angels telecasts on SportsChannel, says that viewers can often experience 
treats of the game that they'd never notice from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I was once broadcasting a 'Game of the Week' when Stan Musial was playing, and 
I noticed the trainer working on him in the dugout," the former NBC commentator 
reminisced. "So I said, 'Stan Musial is being worked on by the trainer. And you 
won't believe what he's doing. He's actually trimming Musial's eyelashes so 
that they won't interfere with his vision when he gets up to bat.' And the 
camera zoomed in real close on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"You miss the ambience, the flavor of the game, sitting at home. I'm sure lots 
of people watching on television got real excited when Kirk Gibson hit that 
home run in the World Series, but being there was something else. But at the 
same time, watching on television you get the benefit of those closeups and 
replays that you just can't see from the bleachers." 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of this lockout-plagued season, Garagiola, 63, the 27-year veteran 
of NBC who left the network following the 1988 season, offered several tips to 
help baseball fans get the most out of watching their favorite game on TV. 
</P>
<P>
* Know the starting pitchers. "If Nolan Ryan is pitching, you'll want to listen 
for the grunts, which I find entertaining, but also you'll want to see if the 
hitters are fouling the ball off or pulling it. If they foul it straight back, 
that means Ryan has his good stuff, but if they are pulling it early in the 
game, that means they are starting their swings very early and his curve is 
going to make a lot of people look silly." 
</P>
<P>
* Check the flags. "If the wind is blowing out, you can say, 'Hey we might have 
some home runs,' but also if a knuckleballer like (Texas Ranger) Charlie Hough 
is scheduled, that wind will make his pitches even livelier, and you'll want to 
watch to see if the catcher is having trouble handling those things." 
</P>
<P>
* Note the dimensions of the park. "In Atlanta or Oakland, there is tons of 
foul territory, so balls that might go into the stands in other stadiums are 
easy outs there. And Fenway Park in Boston has that fence that juts out down 
the left field line, so a hard hit ball just inside the bag can turn into a 
play at first or an easy out at second if the shortstop is alert for the 
ricochet. That's a fun thing to watch for." 
</P>
<P>
* Observe how the ball moves through the grass. On the first hit ball, 
Garagiola recommends noticing whether the ball dies in the tall grass or skips 
with some juice right through it. "In Wrigley field, the grass sometimes gets 
so high that the ball has to eat its way through, and you can expect some 
runners to try to take the extra base." 
</P>
<P>
* Keep an eye on the catcher. "See where the target is, inside, outside and 
whether it's a true target or just a decoy. Sometimes the catcher will put the 
glove in the center of the plate as a decoy, and the pitcher will use his shin 
guard as a target for pitching low and away." 
</P>
<P>
* Watch the baserunners. "Mark how far the runner on first goes for his lead, 
and then check to see f he's in the same place or if his lead is shorter or 
longer after every pitch. That gives you a clue about whether he wants to 
steal." 
</P>
<P>
* Look for the bunt. "With a man on first, watch the catcher motion for the 
pitcher to throw to first, and when he does, don't watch the ball, watch the 
batter. Sometimes at the first bit of motion from the pitcher, the batter will 
start to slide his hand down the bat, giving away the bunt." 
</P>
<P>
* Zero in on the tags. "Television gives you closeups of plays on the bases, 
like around second on a double play. You can see if the shortstop actually 
touches the bag or if he is just in the neighborhood. It's interesting to be 
the umpire on things like that. Or on plays at the plate-Mike Scioscia, the 
human dead end, is great at blocking the plate. But sometimes he does it too 
soon, before he gets the ball. Sometimes he gets away with it and sometimes he 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
* Steal the signs. "With a runner on second, the obvious thing to check is how 
big a lead he's getting, but you can also watch to see if he's trying to steal 
the sign from the catcher and then relay it to the batter. It's tough to steal 
signs, but if he can, he might be bent over with his arms straight, and that 
might mean fastball, and if he bends his arms, that would mean a curve." 
</P>
<P>
* Notice where the batter positions himself in the box. "At the beginning of 
the game, he might be right back at the back line. When the sinkerballer relief 
pitcher comes in, he may move up a step." 
</P>
<P>
A good announcer, Garagiola says, can help point out some of these baseball 
intricacies, and with today's sophisticated fans, can't just get by with 
stating the obvious. If a hard throwing pitcher is breaking a number of bats 
off in the batters' hands, for example, the announcer should note that it 
doesn't mean the team is saddled with a bad bundle of lumber, but that the 
pitcher really has great stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's best for all announcers, even the most astute analysts of the 
game's subtleties, to know when to shut up and let the picture speak for 
itself. "When Nolan Ryan got his fifth no-hitter," Garagiola remembered, "I 
didn't say anything in the ninth inning. The crowd told everyone what was 
happening. The viewers didn't need the announcer to tell them the crowd was in 
a frenzy. Anyone watching could appreciate the moment all by themselves."

COVER STORY: A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME; 
</P>
<P>
CBS AND ESPN TAKE A SWING AT BROADCASTING AMERICA'S PASTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
When the cry of "Play Ball!' goes through the land Monday, it will open a 
season that will see the biggest changes in televising the sport since NBC's 
inaugural telecast in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which has not broadcast a game since 1964, begins at least a four-year run 
as the network of major league baseball Saturday, with a 10 a.m. game between 
the Dodgers and Houston Astros. The network wrestled the contract from NBC and 
from ABC, which started broadcasting the game in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Shaker, CBS Sports' executive producer, asks viewers to be patient with his 
network's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going in beating our chests saying we'll do baseball better than 
it's ever been done before," he said. "We go in with a deep bow to NBC and ABC 
and with a great reverence for the game. It'll take time and we'll make 
mistakes. Hopefully, we won't make them a couple of times. We'll make our own 
imprint on televising baseball, but not right out of the blocks." 
</P>
<P>
He said CBS plans no departures from the traditional approach to televising the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to re-invent the wheel," he said. "NBC for the last four decades 
and ABC since 1976 set the standards for network coverage of baseball on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
The change most noticeable to viewers will come in the booth, where Brent 
Musburger will inherit the play-by-play role held by Vin Scully at NBC since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger's partner will be ex-ABC analyst and catcher Tim McCarver. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the sports we cover, the analyst is the central figure," Shaker said. 
"Tim has a tremendous way of expressing himself, with great humor and 
spontaneity. He'll be able to express himself much more freely than he did at 
ABC, (which covered baseball with a three-man team since it resumed covering 
major league baseball in 1976) because there will be one less person in the 
booth." 
</P>
<P>
The Musburger-McCarver team won't be heard in Southern California until June. 
For the next two Saturdays, the duo of St. Louis Cardinals broadcaster Jack 
Buck and Jim Kaat will call the games aired here. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth member of CBSU announcing team is Greg Gumbel, who will host the 
studio wrap-around show. His brother Bryant once held the same position at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
One tradition that CBS won't be keeping is televising a game every week. After 
an April 21 game between the Angels and Minnesota Twins, baseball will 
disappear from CBS until June 16. Games will be televised each Saturday 
thereafter through Aug. 25, when there will be another hiatus until Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
But the void will be more than made up by cable. 
</P>
<P>
In its first season of major league baseball, ESPN will carry 161 games, with 
double-headers Tuesdays and Fridays and single games Sunday and Wednesdays. 
Coverage begins Monday with an 11:30 a.mm game between the Milwaukee Brewers 
and Chicago White Sox, followed at 5 p.m. by Chicago Cubs-Philadelphia 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Matthews, ESPN's senior vice president in charge of programming, said the 
key to his network's broadcasts will not come from the ballparks but from its 
Bristol, Conn., studios. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we'll be able to go to other games, predominantly on a 
quick turnaround tape basis, to show what's going on," Matthews said. "For 
extraordinary occurences, we will have even greater latitude of bringing live 
the significance of Nolan Ryan's 300th win or a long hitting streak being on 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
The cable all-sports network will also air "Baseball Tonight" a nightly scores, 
highlights, features and analysis show hosted by John Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to put the season into perspective, instead of just reporting it 
as a series of games," said coordinating producer Eric Schoenfeld. "If you 
watch the weekly baseball shows, it's tough for them to pick out the most 
pivotal moments. Because we'lllbe there every night, we'll have pivotal moments 
every night, spotting trends, anticipating upcoming trends and saying why each 
game is meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
MORE LINEUP CHANGES 
</P>
<P>
The changes in baseball's television coverage aren't just limited to the 
network level: 
</P>
<P>
Longtime NBC broadcaster Joe Garagiola joins SportsChannel's Angels crew, 
working with Joe Torre. Meanwhile, Torre will begin his first full season as 
the play-by-play announcer on KTLA's Angel forecasts. Reggie Jackson is 
rejoining the Angels organization, filling Torre' analyst job. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel also has a new Dodger announcing team, Joel Meyers, who announced 
Angels games for the pay service last season, it switching leagues. Former 
Dodger third baseman Ron Cey is the new analyst, replacing Don Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' KTTV crew of Vin Scully, Ross Porter and Don Drysdale remain 
intact. However, because Scully will no longer have NBC commitments to fulfill, 
he is expected for all 50 telecasts.

COVER STORY: CBS AND ESPN TAKE A SWING AT BROADCASTING BASEBALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the cry of "Play ball!" officially goes through the land this week, it 
will open a season that will see the biggest changes in who's covering baseball 
since NBC's inaugural telecast in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, whose pioneering radio and television coverage for seven decades won it 
the distinction as "The Baseball Network," found itself without the sport when 
it was outbid for the exclusive network rights in December, 1988. ABC, which 
also carried regular season games and alternated with NBC on All-Star and 
post-season telecasts since 1976, also was called out. 
</P>
<P>
In their place, CBS, which has not broadcast a game since 1964 -- and with a 
bid of just over $1 billion -- became the exclusive network home of Major 
League Baseball. CBS' coverage begins Saturday with a 10 a.m. game between the 
Dodgers and Houston Astros (on Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, baseball also has agreed to its most extensive cable network 
coverage, with ESPN winning the rights and scheduling 161 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Shaker, CBS Sports' executive producer, asks viewers to be patient with his 
network's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going in beating our chests saying we'll do baseball better than 
it's ever been done before," he said. "We go in with a deep bow to NBC and ABC 
and with a great reverence for the game. It'll take time and we'll make 
mistakes. Hopefully, we won't make them a couple of times. We'll make our own 
imprint on televising baseball, but not right out of the blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Shaker said his network plans no departures from the traditional approach to 
televising the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to re-invent the wheel," Shaker said. "NBC for the last four 
decades and ABC since 1976 set the standards for network coverage of baseball 
on television. They set a high standard, and we'll have to work really hard to 
reach that." 
</P>
<P>
The change most noticeable to viewers will come in the announcing booth. 
Instead of the play-by-play announcer holding the central role, the analyst 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Holding those roles will be longtime major league catcher and former ABC 
analyst Tim McCarver and Jim Kaat, who pitched a record 25 seasons in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim has a tremendous way of expressing himself, with great humor and 
spontaneity. He'll be able to express himself much more freely than he did at 
ABC, (which covered baseball with a three-man team) because there will be one 
less person in the booth." 
</P>
<P>
But McCarver won't be heard in Southern California until June. For the next two 
Saturdays, the duo of Kaat and St. Louis Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck will 
call the games beamed into the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to take the same approach to announcing that I did to pitching -- keep 
it simple, stupid," said Kaat, who has announced for NBC, ESPN and three major 
league teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to prepare and give the avid fan insight he can chew on, but not lose 
the casual fan by going too deep. I want to be honest, objective and 
lighthearted." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of CBS' announcing team is Greg Gumbel, who will host the studio 
wrap-around show. His brother Bryant of the "Today" show once held the same 
position at NBC.

<P>
One tradition CBS won't be keeping is televising a game every week. After an 
April 21 game between the California Angels and Minnesota Twins, baseball will 
disappear on CBS until June 16. Games will be televised each Saturday 
thereafter through Aug. 25, when there will be another hiatus until Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
But the void will be more than made up by cable. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will carry double-headers Tuesdays and Fridays and single games Sunday and 
Wednesday evenings. ESPN's coverage begins Monday with an opening-day game at 
11:30 a.m. between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox, followed by a 5 
p.m. Chicago Cubs-Philadelphia Phillies contest. 
</P>
<P>
According to Loren Matthews, ESPN's senior vice president in charge of 
programming, the key to his network's broadcasts will not come from the 
ballparks but from its Bristol, Conn., studios. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we'll be able to go to other games, predominantly on a 
quick turnaround tape basis to show what's going on," Matthews said. "For 
extraordinary occurrences, we will have even greater latitude of bringing live 
the significance of Nolan Ryan's 300th win or a long hitting streak being on 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
The all-sports cable network also will air "Baseball Tonight," a nightly 
scores, highlights, features and analysis show hosted by John Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to put the season into perspective, instead of just reporting it 
as a series of games," said "Baseball Tonight" coordinating producer Eric 
Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
"If you watch the weekly baseball shows, it's tough for them to pick out the 
three or four most pivotal moments. Because we'll be there every night, we'll 
have pivotal moments every night, spotting trends, anticipating upcoming trends 
and saying why each game is meaningful."

CUBAN BASEBALL: IT'S BIG LEAGUE IN ITS OWN WAY

<P>
Tired of baseball lockouts and strikes? Wish the game were played more for fun 
than for money? 
</P>
<P>
Come to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, the play is very much big league: Fastballs that hum in at 90 
plus mph and double plays turned as smoothly as the swings of the guys with the 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Javier Mendez uncoil from his slight crouch and belt one over the sign 
advertising Fidel Castro's next big speech. Like Cuba's politics, Mendez swings 
from the left. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like he would feel at home in almost any big league lineup. Off the 
field, though, U.S. and Cuban baseball are as different as the two countries' 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as an "owner" in the George Steinbrenner sense. All 
enterprises in Cuba belong to the state, including baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are there "player demands" in Cuba. These fellows, some of them world class 
players, have to settle for their 100 pesos or so a month, no questions asked. 
Collective bargaining? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba-born Jose Canseco, who left the island as an infant, makes about as much 
playing for the Oakland A's in a single inning (over $1,000) as the average 
Cuban player makes in a year and that's no typo. 
</P>
<P>
There's no army of people needed here to handle finances. Admission is free and 
there are no advertising revenues. (Castro gets to put up his sign for free. He 
has other ballpark signs as well: "Socialism or Death" and "Ready to Conquer.") 
</P>
<P>
By U.S. standards, Cuban players endure extraordinary hardships. All travel is 
done by bus on this 800-mile wide island. Because of the U.S. embargo, 
American-made aluminum bats, the kind Cubans prefer, are in short supply. Some 
players are forced to use a bat size not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
Several teams, including Havana, live in barracks-like structures. Even during 
homestands, the players get to go home to their government-provided apartments 
only on the days always set aside for open dates, Mondays and Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
If a player is a student during the off-season, his salary could be as low as 
50 pesos a month. At the official exchange rate, that's only about $45. Kirby 
Puckett spills that much before breakfast. Can you imagine Orel Hershiser 
toiling away for $45 a month? 
</P>
<P>
If a player works as a 150-peso a-month laborer during the off season, he makes 
the same salary when he's playing ball. If he averages three homers and 10 
RBI's a game, it makes no difference: 150 pesos a month, end discussion. 
</P>
<P>
But with housing, food and transportation provided for, the players don't 
complain, at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rich but we have our needs resolved," says Juan Padilla, a whiz 
around second base for the Havana team. 
</P>
<P>
Ahh, Cuban baseball. Memories of Minnie Minoso, Pedro Ramos, Sandy Amoros, 
Camilo Pasqual, Tony Perez. The Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. 
In the last 22 world amateur baseball championships, Cuba has won 19 times, 
finished second once and third twice, according to Baseball Commissioner Manuel 
Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable baseball men figure 35 to 40 Cubans are of major league calibre. 
Cuban pitching appears to be mostly minor league level but it's not hard to 
envision Cubans at other positions, particularly infielders, dazzling crowds at 
Candlestick or Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his lavishly paid counterparts in the U.S. "ligas grandes," 
Mendez, 25, shrugs and says he sees no need for salaries in the million-plus 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when that kind of money corrupts," he says. Castro agrees, 
often lamenting that the U.S. is plagued by "irrational consumerism." Some 
people, he says, think they have to have "65 shirts." Wonder what he would say 
about major leaguers who buy Mercedes by the six-pack? 
</P>
<P>
Mendez is standing in the barracks where he and his mates from the Havana team 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The season is 23 games old and Mendez has been brutalizing opposing pitching, 
hitting a league-leading .392. He has six home runs and 19 RBI's. Injuries 
hampered his performance in previous seasons but no longer. It's about four 
hours before gametime, and most of the team is watching an afternoon soap opera 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
The trappings for the players evoke memories of boot camp: seven players to a 
room, no privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Servio Borges calls the place a "sporting motel." It is located in the 
heart of a sports complex south of the city. Much of the area is devoted to 
training athletic instructors. 
</P>
<P>
With a 17-6 record, Havana is leading the eight-team league in what is known as 
the "serie selectiva," the prestige tournament of the several Cuba holds each 
year. Many players compete virtually all 12 months. The "selectiva" is the 
competition Cuban fans wait for. The winner of the 63-game season gets to play 
abroad and earns bug-eyed adulation from their fans. With fewer players, the 
calibre of play is higher than the 18-team national competition held between 
November and January. 
</P>
<P>
Borges, 43, likes the idea of having his players live under one roof. Last 
year, they all lived at home and the team played poorly, so poorly that the 
local Communist Party chapter sat down with the team for a pep talk. (This 
happens to other teams as well.) 
</P>
<P>
Borges says discipline is better this year and the record shows it. Still, he's 
antsy. The pressures on him are no less than those faced by Tom Lasorda or Don 
Zimmer. There's not much to do in Cuba, so people watch baseball and root hard. 
Morales, the baseball commissioner, says 72% of Cuban televisions are regularly 
tuned in to a game. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a one-time pitching prospect before making a career switch, likes the 
Santiago team from Cuba's east end. He was raised nearby and, besides, that is 
the city where the revolution began. 
</P>
<P>
Borges feels he and his team are constantly under the microscope. The 
"Girardillos," as his team is called, finished in second place four years in a 
row and it's been 15 years since Havana has won the "selectiva." The fans are 
getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular evening, the team dines together on pork chops at the sports 
complex and then boards the bus for the half hour ride to Latin American 
Stadium. As usual, Borges is nervous. The bus takes off behind schedule and he 
won't have time for the pregame meeting. Borges insists his players are nervous 
as well but the horseplay on the bus leaves a different impression. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's opponent is Las Villas, a team from the central part of the country, 
and Havana is gunning for a three-game sweep. From the dressing room, the 
Havana team (known officially as Ciudad Habana) heads for the field, descending 
cement steps that have been chipped away by player spikes since 1946 when this 
relic, unsullied by artificial turf, was built. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium seats 60,000 (some other playing fields in the league hold only 
12,000) but there is a homey atmosphere, with many seats close to the action. 
It has a charm that some of the astroturfed U.S. ballfields lack. 
</P>
<P>
There are relatively few private cars in Cuba so most fans walk to the park or 
take the bus. Shortly before gametime, with about 25,000 people in the stadium, 
about a third of the parking lot -- there are only about 150 spaces -- is 
filled. For the fans, the nice part is walking in and sitting down free of 
charge. The choicest seats are reserved for families of the players and VIP's. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is relaxed. Here at least, the totalitarian police state 
ambience that American conservatives fret about is missing. Blacks predominate 
in the stands and on the playing field. Fans are expected to return foul balls 
hit into the stands. About 10 to 15 balls are used per game, well below the 
major league average. 
</P>
<P>
A strapping right-hander, Lazaro Valle, only 19, has been picked to start for 
the home team. Borges says he's one of the three best pitchers in the league. 
Control would be his biggest problem tonight. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Girardillos are having few problems solving the Las Villas 
starter, Roberto Almarales, a slim righty. The home team, clad in blue and 
white, gets to him early. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the first, Mendez gets a big hand as he steps to the plate, 
the No. 3 hitter. The crowd leaps to its feet when Mendez drills one to deep 
right center. But a stiff wind robs him of a home run; the ball is caught just 
to the right of the 380-foot sign and to the left of the sign for Fidel's 
speech. Still, Havana jumps out to a 2-0 in the first. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the second, the crowd gasps as the Havana catcher, Armando 
Ferreiro, is struck on the side of the head by an Almarales pitch. He lies 
motionless at home plate. Soon he is carried off on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
The American ancestry of the game is very evident here despite efforts by the 
government to eradicate U.S. influence in other aspects of Cuban life. Instead 
of Spanish translations, the scoreboard shows "SS," "RF," "LF," and "CF" to 
designate positions. The borrowing from the English doesn't stop there: strike, 
inning, out, umpire, wild pitch and passed ball. A hit is a "jit." You can 
guess what a "jonron" is. A "Texas?." You guessed that one, too. 
</P>
<P>
Borges had offered to let Ferreira sit out the game because his wife was in the 
last stages of a difficult pregnancy. But Ferreira wouldn't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Money can't buy that kind of dedication," said Borges, implying that perhaps 
the U.S. should follow Cuba's example and go amateur. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after walking his second time up, Mendez rockets another shot into 
the wind toward right his next turn. Again a potential home run falls short but 
at least he gets a sacrifice fly ("fly de sacrificio" in the local lingo). 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth inning, with the home team ahead 6-0, a local gadfly dubbed 
"Armando el tintorero" (Armando the laundryman) leaps onto the top of the 
Havana dugout with a pail and a broom and goes to work, celebrating the 
anticipated clean sweep of Las Villas. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the eighth, Havana's lead swells to 11-3. Mendez, having been 
denied two homers by the wind, steps up with two on. He crushes yet another 
toward right. Even a gale couldn't stop this one. It sails into the bleachers 
and Mendez can finally circle the bases. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the score 14-3. Under league rules, if a team is ahead by 10 or more 
runs after seven innings, the game is over. So it's a kayo for the home team 
tonight, or in everyday jargon, a "nocaut." Guess where they got that word?

A BRAVE NEW WORLD FOR LUIS MONREAL; 
</P>
<P>
CHIEF OF THE HIGHLY RESPECTED GETTY CONSERVATION INSTITUTE WILL INHERIT A 
MOUNTAIN OF GLOBAL POLITICAL CHALLENGES AT UNESCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Luis Monreal leaves the Getty Conservation Institute on Tuesday, he will 
walk away from an efficient, highly regarded organization that he has built in 
five years flat. Acting as a catalytic force for international art 
conservation, GCI spearheads field projects around the world, offers expertise, 
runs training programs and conducts scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
On May 1, on the other hand, when Monreal becomes coordinator of Cultural 
Heritage Programs for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization in Paris, he will walk into a political rat's nest. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends have been calling and asking if I have thought this through, if I know 
what I am getting into. But when I take the plunge, I take the plunge," Monreal 
said in an interview in his Marina del Rey office. Having said goodby to 
California's ski slopes on a weekend trip to Mammoth, the 47-year-old 
archeologist was attempting to clear his desk of dozens of projects while 
looking ahead to a mountain of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
UNESCO was created in 1945, amid a rush of postwar idealism that stressed 
education's role in safeguarding peace and promoting international 
understanding. In its early years, the United Nations-affiliated agency focused 
on intellectual exchanges between Western Europe and the United States, but it 
steadily grew more political. In the late '50s, after the Soviet Union and its 
East European allies joined, UNESCO become a stage for ideological battles. 
Newly independent African and Asian countries joined in the '60s, pressing the 
organization to promote literacy in the Third World and to protect their 
nations' cultural treasures. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, from 1974 to 1987, 
UNESCO was criticized for becoming increasingly anti-Western and politically 
motivated. Conflict came to a head over a proposal to establish a "New World 
Information and Communication Order," aimed at censoring the Western press 
through a "code of conduct" for journalists that would have given governments a 
right to control information. The United States pulled out in 1984 and cut off 
its annual contribution of nearly $50 million, and was followed by the United 
Kingdom in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
UNESCO's current director general, Federico Mayor Zaragoza, a 54-year-old 
biochemist and former Spanish minister of education, was elected as a reform 
candidate in November, 1987. He immediately dropped the "New World Information 
and Communication Order" proposal -- stating that such a practice would violate 
human rights clauses in UNESCO's charter -- eliminated 826 positions and 
drafted a plan to return the agency to its original mandate to deal with 
educational, cultural and scientific issues. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor's proposed reforms have been favorably received in the American press, 
but his plan to restructure the agency's administration has set off a raging 
protest among UNESCO staff and member countries. About 800 staff members 
conducted a two-hour strike on March 20 to protest Mayor's plan and his 
appointment of 17 new senior officers, including Monreal, a fellow Spaniard. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't say no to a friend in need," said Monreal. "The challenges are too 
important not to be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
If the political obstacles are surmountable, Monreal appears to be supremely 
qualified for the job. His strength at the Getty, according to his colleagues, 
has been his ability to envision projects involving interdisciplinary, 
international cooperation and to set them up so that impoverished countries 
reap the long-term benefits of learning to care for their own national 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
"His vision as an archeologist has broadened my own perspective and made me 
aware of the issues and needs in developing countries," said Frank Preusser, 
chief scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute. "His most remarkable 
quality is his enthusiasm and everlasting energy that motivates people to go 
far beyond what's required of them as employees. He's full of new ideas. If 
anybody can revitalize the cultural heritage programs at UNESCO, it's Luis." 
Monreal said he will carry on "the same mission but with different means" at 
UNESCO, working with a governmental network of about 150 countries. "This is 
not a career move for me. It's a linear decision after 27 years of work in the 
field," Monreal said. "I started as a museum curator (at the Mares Museum in 
Barcelona), then became secretary general of the International Council of 
Museums (a UNESCO affiliate with a membership of 8,000 museum specialists from 
121 countries), then set up an international conservation program here. I will 
continue to work for the preservation and conservation of our cultural 
heritage." 
</P>
<P>
The highest priority, however, is re-enlisting the support of the United 
States, he said. "Without the U.S., UNESCO has lost credibility. The lack of 
U.S. support not only jeopardizes funding (the U.S. contribution amounted to 
25% of the agency's budget in 1984), it mutilates the international vitality of 
programs and severely handicaps expertise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"UNESCO was probably the best, most efficient U.N. agency in the '60s," Monreal 
said, recalling how it caught his imagination in the early '60s. As a young 
archeologist working in the Sudan, Monreal saw UNESCO rally public and private 
resources to save Nubian archeological treasures before they were flooded by 
the Aswan Dam in Egypt. "The Nubian monuments provided an example of what 
intergovernmental agencies could do. UNESCO pioneered the salvaging of cultural 
heritage on a great scale and mobilized a tremendous amount of resources," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Monreal's new job will consist of "contributing and developing programs that 
respond to real needs" and "increasing resources allocated to cultural heritage 
programs," he said. Monreal intends to seek support from the private sector, 
including corporations and foundations. "I always say that the conservation of 
cultural heritage is a great technological showcase," he said, citing 
Olivetti's funding of the restoration of Leonardo paintings and Japanese 
television's underwriting of the Sistine Chapel's cleaning. Potential donors 
might supply technology or raw material, as well as money, but first they need 
to increase their awareness of the need to preserve the world's cultural 
heritage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Mayor's new administrative structure, Monreal will be responsible for 
monuments, sites, artifacts and ethnographic material, as well as "non-material 
culture," described as performing arts and oral traditions that can be 
preserved through publications. At the Getty Conservation Institute, Monreal 
will leave an organization staffed by 70 people of 16 nationalities, housed in 
a sprawling office and laboratory complex in Marina del Rey. "Day by day, it 
has been the most fabulous years of my life, and I leave with great sadness," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
GCI has developed almost exactly according to the blueprint that he presented 
to Harold Williams, head of the J. Paul Getty Trust, before he was hired, 
Monreal said. He credits that to the Getty's resources, "a marvelous crew," the 
confidence of trustees and "a margin of freedom." There's also the matter of 
luck. When Williams pressed him for an example of the field projects he would 
undertake if hired by the Getty, Monreal boldly stated that they could save the 
paintings in the tomb of Nefertari in Upper Egypt, never dreaming that project 
would become GCI's most spectacular success. 
</P>
<P>
Working out complex negotiations with the Egyptian government, private 
companies and museum personnel around the world, and conducting laboratory 
research in Tokyo, Rome and Los Angeles, the institute developed a desperately 
needed treatment for decay caused by salt efflorescence. The salvaging of the 
tomb murals is a stunning example of what can be accomplished when conservators 
and scientists talk to each other and when resources are gathered to support 
their efforts, Monreal said. 
</P>
<P>
He is equally proud of less visible projects, noting that GCI is "the only 
conservation research program that works systematically to solve problems that 
no one understands." One of these problems concerns coatings that are used on 
most conservation projects -- without regard for how they age, discolor and 
possibly cause damage. The institute also has examined the effects of indoor 
environment on works of art and developed low-maintenance, nitrogen-filled 
showcases that arrest bio-deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
Training is also a major commitment at the institute. A September project will 
train conservators to treat painted wood sculpture and paintings from Australia 
and the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping a handle on all these in-house and field endeavors is a daunting task, 
which Monreal intends to leave to the discretion of his unnamed successor. He 
won't give gratuitous advice, but he passionately hopes that GCI will maintain 
its world view and that the Getty Trust will continue to fund an ambitious 
conservation program. "Conservation is not a luxury. It's necessary for 
education and for the identity of groups and nations. We need more than 
photographic documentation of important sites," he said. "Real objects are 
important because they help us understand who we are and where we go."

</P>
<P>
KATHLEEN TURNER RELISHES THE CHALLENGE AND CACHET OF PLAYING TENNESSEE 
WILLIAMS' STEAMIEST CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Decked out in a lace slip and little else, Kathleen Turner's beckoning form 
looms over the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on West 49th Street, easily seducing 
passers-by from the two other marquees in view. 
</P>
<P>
Without a glance at the title -- "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," that drama club 
perennial -- you might think Turner's competition was "Lovers in Heat" at the 
World Porn Spectacular down the block, not Somerset Maugham's "The Circle," 
another Broadway revival playing under demure signage across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Turner makes no apologies for stalking audiences with such impudence; this is 
her first sashay onto Broadway in more than a decade, and, with her role as 
Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams' fervid melodrama, the actress shrugs, "I 
couldn't imagine just creeping in unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Turner caused Boston Globe critic Kevin Kelly to loose an alliterative stream 
that would shame the most ardent publicist: she was "steamy, sultry, sexy, 
socko, sinuous, syncopated, scintillating," his review stammered, before 
closing with a veiled hope: "serenade-able . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Even the New York Times' Frank Rich, said Turner was "mesmerizing to watch," 
observing that "to see this actress put on her nylons, a ritual of exquisitely 
prolonged complexity, is a textbook lesson in what makes a star." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Turner hopes to show more than an ability to unroll her stockings. At 
age 35, she senses a crucial point in her career; seductress roles will grow 
scarcer as she ages, Turner notes, so the screen siren who made a name playing 
sexy, dangerous women wants to prove she can act as well. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Maggie, which Turner calls "kind of a Hamlet for women," met her 
objectives. She instigated the current production, which is directed by Howard 
Davies and features Charles Durning as Big Daddy, Polly Holliday as Big Mama 
and Daniel Hugh Kelly as their favorite son, Brick. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a good play, not just some vanity role that would get me on stage in 
the flesh, " she said. Not that the flesh part bothered her: "When I get 
older," she says, "there'll be plenty of time to do Lady Macbeth and all that." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, of course, isn't the only Hollywood figure who feels a need to prove 
something on a New York stage. This season, she joins actors ranging from 
Dustin Hoffman ("Merchant of Venice") to Justine Bateman ("Crucible"), who have 
found Cliff Notes-certified classics the perfect vehicle for their talents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't suppose there's any film or TV actress who isn't sometimes made to 
feel her medium is second-rate," Turner said. "This play can only enhance my 
reputation. It's got a cachet, it gives me what they call 'legit' acting 
credentials." 
</P>
<P>
The play, which Williams himself called "the American 'Lear,' " depicts the 
dying hours of a Mississippi patriarch, Big Daddy Pollitt, and the duplicitous 
maneuverings of his eager heirs. Act I is essentially a monologue by the 
frustrated, clawing Maggie, who seeks to excite her taciturn husband, Brick. 
She yearns for a child to consummate her membership in the Pollitt clan, but 
the drunken Brick spurns her affection, unable to shake the memory of his 
friend Skipper, a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences of the 1958 film version might have wondered why Brick, played by 
Paul Newman, scorned the ardors of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie. The present 
revival returns to Williams' original text, which confronts the homosexual 
nature of Brick and Skipper's friendship less obliquely. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly for Turner's purposes, it also shifts attention from Big Daddy 
to Maggie; unlike "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof's" two other Broadway productions -- 
the 1955 premiere and a 1974 revival -- where Big Daddy thundered his way 
through the third and final act, the original text calls for that potentially 
distracting character to be out of Turner's way by the end of Act II. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted to be a supporting actress," she explains. "I'm damn good on 
stage and I want to show it." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean she's unfazed by criticism, however. To Rich's complaint that 
"she lacks the vulnerability of a woman 'eaten up with longing' for the man who 
shuns her bed," Turner responds, "Vulnerable? I thought I was doing it. I mean, 
I get gulps from the audience." 
</P>
<P>
This vulnerability issue touches a nerve with Turner. "All my life I've been 
hearing that I'm not vulnerable enough. I don't know what the hell they mean," 
she said. "Does 'vulnerable' mean some essential inability to function? I 
guess, then, I've got a problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
Since her first screen role as "Body Heat's" murderess 10 years ago, the 
Missouri-born Turner has artfully constructed her persona as a femme fatale. 
Roles in such movies as "Prizzi's Honor," "Crimes of Passion" and even as the 
voice of voluptuous Jessica in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" created the image; an 
off-screen acerbity and impatience with the celebrity press added to it. In 
interviews, she's known to assume Spanish and British accents, drop into 
character unexpectedly, and dismiss the talents of the '40s icon she's often 
compared to, Lauren Bacall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an expert at presenting Kathleen Turner, capital K, capital T, whether 
it's finding the right sentence to say, or the right way to say it. I have a 
kind of carriage that projects the beautiful, powerful presence of a woman," 
she said. "That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Turner was quick to tell an interviewer that she had forgotten when the 
Academy Awards ceremony was scheduled this month. Not recognized for her role 
in "War of the Roses," not asked to present an award to anyone else, the 
once-nominated Turner (for "Peggy Sue Got Married") proclaimed: "Am I going to 
watch the Oscars? Hell no! They didn't remember me, so I can't be expected to 
remember them." 
</P>
<P>
When not engaged in the sultry affectations she sees as her job, however, 
Turner offered views on the state of theater, and the play she put together and 
previewed in Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburg and Wilmington, Del., before 
opening on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
She admires Williams' involved speeches, which "start off intensely 
naturalistic, but then switch to such tremendous poetry. It's amazing how he 
does it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner concedes, though, that the play's topical themes haven't held up as well 
as Williams' poetry: Homosexuality, infidelity and cancer are no longer taboo 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shock value any more in having a woman come on stage and take off 
her dress," Turner said. "But I think that change in attitude removes a 
distraction, it makes the play's real content much stronger. The real issues 
are about honesty, not homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
More recent works didn't have the same appeal. 
</P>
<P>
She admires David Mamet, but "would never in a million years do what Madonna 
did in 'Speed the Plow.' I didn't like 'Burn This.' 'The Heidi Chronicles?' How 
could I do it? I'm not New York-bred, and I'm not Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Turner, who lives in Greenwich Village with her husband, real 
estate developer Jay Weiss and her 2-year-old daughter, Rachel Ann, aims to 
appear in at least one play and one film each year. In the fall, she plans to 
begin shooting a detective movie, "Hard Boiled." After that -- and after a 
hoped for second child -- Turner said she'd like to perform in more vintage 
works, perhaps a Noel Coward play, or, coincidentally, to once again return a 
play made into an Elizabeth Taylor movie to the stage: Shakespeare's "The 
Taming of the Shrew." 
</P>
<P>
"I was having this fight with (actor) Ron Silver, and I thought, 'You know, we 
could really knock each other out on stage as Katherine and Petrucchio," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the credibility that major stage roles add to her movie career, 
Turner asserted an almost evangelical belief in theater's value to society. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this idea that outside church, theater is one of the few places you can 
be close to somebody and be part of a group experience at the same time. It's 
amazing the trust that occurs, just from being so physically close to so many 
other people. It's a way of lifting the isolation that people feel so much 
today. 
</P>
<P>
That feeling of trust has its limits, though, even for a star as assured as 
Turner. Pointing to a box overhanging the Eugene O'Neill's intimate stage, she 
recalled an audience member who seemed all too close. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the bed kicking up my legs, putting on my stockings, and I look up, and 
the guy sitting in the box is staring at me through binoculars. Even for me, 
that's a little too much."

<P>
ONCE, WE SAW someone get his nose bit off here." 
</P>
<P>
John Waters offers this memory as if it were an unimpeachable reason to love 
The Club Charles, where he is now sitting. 
</P>
<P>
The Charles is Waters' favorite bar in Baltimore, his hometown and the setting 
for his peculiar contributions to American film making. The place features a 
giant finger that hangs from the ceiling and points toward the entrance, as if 
to urge patrons back onto the street. It's a Tuesday night and the club is 
nearly deserted, though the weekend crowd, Waters claims, is the "most mixed 
ever -- blacks, whites, young, old, transvestites." Of course, the club was 
even better in its former incarnation as the Wigwam. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the scariest bar in the entire country, full of drunken hillbillies," 
recalls Patricia Moran in a complimentary tone. Moran, Waters' sidekick of 25 
years, is instinctively slumped against him. 
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of Wigwam wildness must still be floating through the air. For the 
past 20 minutes, a hulking man in a baseball cap has been dementedly glaring at 
Waters and Moran from his bar stool nearby. Waters strikes a pose of calculated 
disinterest that is worthy of Ronald Colman. Gracefully he tucks his palms into 
the pockets of his finely tailored black jacket, crosses one chartreuse 
corduroy trouser leg over the other and looks away. 
</P>
<P>
At 43, Waters still enjoys such minuscule brushes with danger. In fact, this 
fascination is what the John Waters celluloid world of cross-dressers, former 
B-girls and various hard cases is about. This, after all, is the man who 
transformed his corpulent childhood neighbor, Harris Glenn Milstead, into 
Divine, a 300-pound drag queen who in Waters' "Pink Flamingos" competed with 
baby sellers for the title of Filthiest Person Alive -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, Waters gravitated to "people who were everything my 
parents were against." Even in high school, he'd drag home only the most 
alarming reprobates, hoping to send his vehemently middle-class family into a 
tizzy. Take "the girl who had a beehive hairdo and no teeth," he says. "My 
mother wept." 
</P>
<P>
The baseball-capped man finally slides off his perch and appears poised to leap 
right on top of them. Abruptly he exits. "Once, we saw someone's nose get bit 
off," Waters says, his dark gray eyes following the would-be assailant. 
</P>
<P>
How horrible. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" shrugs Moran. "Wasn't our noses." 
</P>
<P>
"It got sewed right back on," Waters adds in a Baltimore drawl. He flashes an 
ambiguous smile, one that seems both wry and soothing. "Besides, he wasn't 
Montgomery Clift to start off with." 
</P>
<P>
THIS LIGHTER SIDE of far-fetched mayhem perhaps best defined the naughty thrill 
behind what Waters calls his "early atrocities." What midnight movie fans came 
to expect was all-around offensiveness: chicken decapitations and whiny 
soliloquies, unfolding with what was assumed to be spontaneity. But, actually, 
Waters was a by-the-book director -- every perversion was carefully detailed in 
his talky scripts, no ad-libbing allowed. These cheapie shock flicks had a 
style all their own -- the scratchy, garish cinematography was intentional 
(though, because of Waters' anorexic bank account, also unavoidable). For the 
uninitiated, the story line of the magnificently dented "Female Trouble" (1974) 
tells it all: Dawn Davenport, an explosively temperamental teen-ager (played by 
Divine), runs away from home, hitchhikes her way into the arms of a slobby 
no-account named Earl Peterson (also played by Divine) who impregnates and then 
abandons her to a life of prostitution. Playing out the sorry hand fate has 
dealt her, Dawn's rapidly loosening hold on reality leads her to commit mass 
homicide -- as the climax of her trampoline nightclub act, she blows away the 
audience. The grand finale? Our heroine jerking delightedly as she fries in the 
electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
In "Multiple Maniacs" (1970), "Pink Flamingos" (1972) and "Desperate Living" 
(1977), Waters continued to refine his comic flair for no-apologies filth. It 
wasn't until "Polyester" (1981), a romantic melodrama starring Divine and '50s 
teen idol Tab Hunter, that Waters made a film that "didn't try to scare 
anyone." But when 1988's "Hairspray," a teen-dance sendup, became a commercial 
hit, it signaled more than the fact that Waters' overactive imagination had 
begun spewing forth PG images. Financed for $2.6 million by New Line Cinema, 
the independent production company that distributed all of Waters' films, 
"Hairspray" took in $7 million in theatrical distribution and continues to make 
money on tape rentals. 
</P>
<P>
"John Waters is money in the bank," says Sara Risher, president of production 
at New Line. "But I'm still not convinced that a typical Hollywood mentality 
will ever understand a John Waters point of view or how to sell it." Executives 
at Universal Studios apparently disagree. The studio paid Waters a reported $1 
million for his current release, "Cry-Baby," an Elvis Presley-like musical 
about an adolescent tough and the pristine, upper-class girl he loves. With a 
$10-million budget, Waters bought himself this luxuriously strange dream cast: 
Johnny Depp, Patty Hearst, Polly Bergen, Troy Donahue, David Nelson and Traci 
Lords. 
</P>
<P>
Since the success of "Hairspray," Waters has received the adulation usually 
reserved for cultural icons. He has become a frequent guest on "Late Night With 
David Letterman." A collection of his original scripts has been placed in the 
cinema archives at Connecticut's Wesleyan University, alongside those of 
directors Elia Kazan and Frank Capra. "Maybe today he seems like an outsider, 
but 30 years from now, he'll seem like the only person who fit in," says 
Jeanine Basinger, a professor of American studies at Wesleyan. "He understands 
that the art of our times is our trash." 
</P>
<P>
AN EMPTY DUNKIN' Donuts coffee cup and a crumpled box of Juicy Fruit lay on the 
floor of Waters' midnight-blue Chrysler Le Baron. Always, this is how he 
drives: left foot wedged underneath right knee, radio dial anchored on an 
oldies station. When "Town Without Pity" comes on, he cranks it up. "That's the 
anthem of Baltimore," he says. Because all of Waters' 11 films have been shot 
in his revered home town, it seems that every building evokes some cinematic or 
personal recollection. 
</P>
<P>
On Lombard Street is the mustard-hued University of Maryland, where Waters 
mounted the "world premiere" of his most notorious film, "Pink Flamingos." "The 
poodle came on a jeweled leash," he excitedly recalls. "Love isn't exactly the 
word for how it was received. Let's just say I could tell it worked." 
</P>
<P>
Some landmarks need only the briefest description. Waters gestures toward a 
grim-looking complex surrounded by coils of razor-wire. "The Maryland 
Penitentiary," he says in an ominous voice. "The Big House. The Joint. The Big 
Bird Cage." 
</P>
<P>
Soon he aims his Chrysler down the narrow avenue called The Block, Baltimore's 
burlesque district. "When Divine and I were 15 or something we used to hook 
school to see Libby Jones, Irma the Body and Zorro." Waters gets out and tugs 
at the door of Blaze Starr's Two O'Clock club. Locked. 
</P>
<P>
"I love strippers," he says dreamily. This is an understatement. To hear Waters 
hold forth on exotic dancers is to gain insight into the genesis of an 
aesthetic principle. "I like the ones who love it, who don't think it's one bit 
weird. Like, 'Whaddya mean? I'm in show business!' " says Waters, in a Gypsy 
Rose Lee honk. "There's a tawdriness that's glamour in reverse. Like, as long 
as they believe it, it's true." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Waters is gulping down shellfish at the Lexington Market. "Oh, look it," 
he whispers admiringly. Waters is staring at a middle-aged woman in a white 
damask dress and bubble hairdo, her head tilting flirtatiously at a chubby 
businessman puffing a five-inch cigar. "Them, I could think up a whole story 
about," he says. "She's an ex-hooker and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
This habit of conjuring up scenarios about strangers is testimony to Waters' 
fascination with the human condition. "John's always been interested in the 
mechanics of peoples' lives, figuring out what makes them do stuff," says Mink 
Stole, one of his longtime starlets. And his curiosity displays itself in his 
infatuation with the most sensationalistic criminal cases. Not only does he see 
them as good bad theater, Waters loves all the personal minutiae that is 
revealed in the name of jurisprudence. He has sat in on some of the most 
notorious trials in recent memory, from those of the Manson family to that of 
serial killer Richard Ramirez. He reads -- voraciously -- every overripe 
true-crime book, devours every newspaper account. 
</P>
<P>
While attending the McMartin Preschool pre-trial in 1984, he spotted some of 
the defendants meekly eating their lunches in the cafeteria. "Nobody would get 
near their table," he says. Waters raises his two pointer fingers and makes the 
hex sign. "So, I just took my tray and sat down with them." He asked his 
luncheon companions: "If you're not guilty, why aren't you furious?" 
</P>
<P>
"The best defendant to watch," wrote Waters in his first book, "Shock Value," 
"is one who is guilty and unrepentant but who denies his guilt." Over the 
years, his tastes have changed: "What interests me now is what happens when 
someone is guilty and then they get better. How do they deal with what they 
have done?" 
</P>
<P>
This shift in focus owes much to Waters' explorations beyond the courtroom. (A 
hilarious chapter in his second book, "Crackpot," describes his stint teaching 
film at Patuxent Institution, a maximum-security facility outside Baltimore.) 
Perhaps the relationships he has built with a number of convicted murderers 
have blunted the exhilaration, their ghoulish deeds revealed, finally, as 
real-life tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the causes to which Waters lends his name is Friends of Leslie, a group 
that urges parole for Manson family member Leslie Van Houten. "This is one of 
the few subjects that I hope you don't use for its shock value," Waters 
requests. "Like, 'Hey! He knows a Manson girl!' I have visited Leslie for many 
years, and I think she should get out. The public still thinks of that 
bald-headed girl from 21 years ago. I know I was very different 21 years ago 
than I am now. Leslie is not a girl. She's a 40-year-old woman who looks back 
on what she did with," Waters pauses for the right word " . . . with horror. If 
you believe in rehabilitation, if you believe that there is such a thing as 
that, then Leslie is totally rehabilitated." 
</P>
<P>
OVER THE FIREPLACE at his parents' two-story red-brick house is a pastel 
portrait of John Waters at 6 years old, with round and wetly sad-looking eyes. 
"John doesn't like it; I do," smiles Patricia Waters, his mother. She clasps 
her hands, then unclasps them, and self-consciously pats her Barbara Bush-white 
hair. Reporters make her nervous; they want to rehash times she'd rather not 
remember. "John's a very good singer and dancer," she announces at one point. 
"He taught me how to do the cha-cha. But he says he's not a good dancer and he 
won't do anything in public that he doesn't shine at." Then, she adds 
hurriedly, "Um, you'd better get John to OK that." 
</P>
<P>
Her hesitation dissipates only when she speaks about her five grandchildren or 
shows off her collection of English coronation ware or points out the 
impressive estate in nearby Guilford where she grew up. She walks through her 
spotless home, revealing polished hardwood floors, well-appointed mahogany 
antiques and beautiful Oriental rugs. This is her chance to set the record 
straight: John Waters came from a good home. 
</P>
<P>
On the walls, there are several framed photographs of a china-blue Victorian, 
the house in Lutherville where John was reared. The way both mother and son 
tell the story, this was where Waters' film career was born: In 1964, after 
Waters' grandmother presented him with an 8-millimeter Brownie movie camera, he 
made "Hag in a Black Leather Jacket." The 17-minute short, filmed on the roof 
of the house, was about an interracial romance. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to shock the world," his mother sighs. "He was trying to shock 
me, too." She skips the dinner table rages over the length of her son's oily 
hair, the couple's conservative politics (as a frame of reference, consider 
that Waters' uncle was John Whitaker, former Undersecretary of the Interior in 
Nixon's Cabinet). She brushes aside his expulsion from his dormitory at New 
York University for smoking marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Says her son: "I can look back on those times and think, 'Ah, youth.' My 
parents can't. It's still painful to them." His mother says: "I never knew what 
he was so angry about. But at some point in his life he decided that he was 
against everything we stood for." 
</P>
<P>
When she can, she makes eye-rolling, jokey references to her confusion about 
her eldest son's peculiarities. Unlike his two younger sisters and brother, he 
adored villainous characters and the staging of hideous wrecks with his toy 
cars. "He also loved to exaggerate," she says. After the first week at public 
junior high school, he told his mother, "As long as you don't stab the teacher 
with a nail file or a knife, they pass you." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he was making a lot of it up. But it makes a mother and father like 
this" -- she stretches out her hands and makes them tremble. 
</P>
<P>
She was relieved to find "Hairspray" a "very kind, sweet movie." But neither 
she nor her husband, John Waters Sr., has seen "Pink Flamingos," and they don't 
intend to. "It would be upsetting," she says, stiffening. "We can't understand 
why anybody would want to put those gross ideas on the screen." Yet, she 
clearly savors the irony that for others, her son's fame has somehow sanitized 
those astonishing images. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people who used to ask, 'How's Kathy? How's Stephen? How's Trish?' 
And not even ask about John. Now they say, 'Oh, you must so be proud of him!' 
And I laugh. What was in that can 10 years ago hasn't changed," says Patricia, 
referring to her son's early films. 
</P>
<P>
Growing older has allowed her and Waters the delicately constructed friendship 
of mothers and adult sons. Theirs is a truce in which personal tastes are 
graciously indulged and mutual respect is expressed in exchanging advice. John 
and Patricia Waters are planning to fly to England together. "He asked me to 
show him a few things," she says, clapping her hands together. "I think he'd 
like the Tower of London. He'd like to know where everybody got beheaded." 
</P>
<P>
ON A QUIET,tree-lined street in north Baltimore, around the corner from the 
elementary school he once attended, is the four-story home that John Waters 
purchased a year and a half ago. Much has been made of his grotesque decorating 
touches -- the vintage submachine gun on the floor of an anteroom, the electric 
chair from "Female Trouble" in the hallway, the bad oil painting by mass 
murderer John Wayne Gacy in the guest room. 
</P>
<P>
But this is far more surprising: The Oriental rugs, the abundance of vases 
stuffed with fresh-cut daffodils and tulips, the tasteful antiques. It 
duplicates, if anything, the bright, comfortable elegance of his parents' 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of his "maturity" seems to rankle him, if only for the fact that there are 
few similarities between his own lifestyle and that of his characters. Waters, 
in fact, sticks to a rather wholesome schedule: He's up every morning by 7 and 
writes for at least four hours every day. No socializing on weeknights. 
"There's this conception that his films were really documentaries," says Mink 
Stole. "But I've never even seen him out of control." For years Waters smoked 
three and a half packs of cigarettes a day; his Kool Lights were as much his 
trademark as that skinny mustache he shamelessly highlights with eyebrow 
pencil. But six months ago, he decided to quit when his brother, Stephen, was 
hospitalized with a brain tumor. "He's fine now," says Waters. "But it scared 
the hell out of me. 
</P>
<P>
"I came the closest ever to a nervous breakdown trying to quit," he says. It 
doesn't show. His sharp angularity is gone; those 10 extra pounds he gained 
have given him an old-Hollywood elegance. Waters -- who once noted sourly that 
jogging was OK only if someone was chasing you -- now engages in a clandestine 
daily sit-up regimen. Some of his friends say he has never looked more dashing. 
"Plus," says Pat Moran, "his skin isn't green anymore." 
</P>
<P>
There are close friends whom he misses, ones who aren't around to share the 
good times. Edith Massey, a centerpiece of the Waters ensemble, died of cancer 
in 1984. Cookie Mueller, the fierce ingenue from his earli est films, succumbed 
recently to AIDS. Two years ago, Divine died in his sleep, just days after the 
bandwagon "Hairspray" reviews began pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
The events following Divine's death are blurred in Waters' memory. He just went 
through the motions: giving the press a statement, attending to the burial. It 
was, he says, like being in "an off-Broadway play, 'The Night Divine Died,' " 
the highlights of which included a funeral that was both extravagant and odd. 
The neighborhood Waters and Divine grew up in was brought to a standstill by 
the enormous procession of mourners. The makers of "Married With Children," the 
sitcom that Divine was to have taped a segment of the following day, sent 
flowers with a card that read: "Why didn't you just tell us you didn't want to 
do it?" 
</P>
<P>
But when silence replaced the uproar, Waters found himself angered over this 
saddest of endings. "It was like, God, how unfair," he says in a tight voice. 
"Divine really struggled all those years and never got much of a chance to 
enjoy it. He was too young to die. Divine would have been a great old man." 
</P>
<P>
WATERS IS CIRCLING Fell's Point, a dockside shopping district still pleasantly 
seamy enough to accommodate raggedy panhandlers and street-corner drunks, 
looking for someplace to park. "Over there is where Edie's shop used to be," he 
says. Now it's two doors down and is being run by her old partner. After her 
mewling performance in "Pink Flamingos," Massey put her savings into a 
knickknack store. When Waters was in a bad mood, he "would come down here and 
she'd always make me laugh, just by saying things that were so off the wall." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Waters has been accused of exploiting Massey's dizziness, Divine's 
desperate need for acceptance and Ricki Lake's plumpness. This year, he will 
undoubtedly be criticized for making fun of Kim McGuire, a goggle-eyed actress 
who plays Hatchet Face in "Cry-Baby." 
</P>
<P>
"All show biz is exploitation. What's the difference between exploiting Meryl 
Streep because she's a good actress and Edie because she's like no other 
actress? What I'm saying is that I genuinely believe that being 
alarming-looking or overweight makes you a star in my movies, and I hope that 
any time someone is a star in a movie of mine it makes their life better." 
</P>
<P>
As the size of Waters' cast of curiosities grows, so does respect for the 
auteur. The telephone rings constantly with speaking-engagement offers; editors 
are eager to print his tautly written essays, some of which elaborate on "why 
he loves" Christmas and The National Enquirer. If he wants, his next screenplay 
-- which isn't yet written -- already has a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
But if Waters' popularity has anything to do with a certain kindness at the 
heart of his work, it carries over into more conventional good deeds. The 
premier of "Cry-Baby," for example, was a benefit for AIDS Action Baltimore, 
attended by the whole cast and Waters' entire family. You have to give Waters 
credit for consistency, though. This indisputably benevolent gesture comes with 
its own tilted perspective. "You know what I always tell 'em?" Waters says. 
"Give the money to the worst junkies, to the ones that even gay groups hate. 
They're the ones who need it the most. Not only are they sick, they're mean. 
You know, it's hard enough to be sick without being bitter, mean and 
friendless." 
</P>
<P>
Waters is heading up another block, another long-ago film location. Then his 
lively monologue ("in 'Multiple Maniacs,' this was where the Infant of Prague 
appears to Divine . . . and over there is where Divine got raped in the alley") 
is interrupted. Up ahead, on the grimy sidewalk, are three boys who are 
startled to be confronted by two strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just what are you doing?" Waters asks in the voice of a stern uncle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're throwin' rocks on the roof," the bravest one pipes up.

THE GUNS BOOM THEIR salute in the morning haze, echoing from the hills. Down on 
the parade ground, the cadets stand stiffly in the stifling heat, 146 
ramrod-straight youths wearing heavy gray wool tunics and red-plumed hats 
copied from West Point. It is graduation weekend at the Philippine Military 
Academy, in the mountains five hours north of Manila, and President Corazon C. 
Aquino is coming to call. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a bomb exploded in the reviewing stand before Aquino arrived, 
killing four people. This year, the military is taking no chances. Soldiers 
search for car bombs, jeepswith .50-caliber machine guns guard the gates, and 
scowling sharpshooters in black commando garb peer from rooftops. But 
attendance is low. Several top officers and U.S. Embassy officials, among many 
others, have remained in Manila, nervously awaiting what the morning headlines 
predict will be yet another coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an unreasonable fear. In December, rightist rebel soldiers nearly 
toppled Aquino in the sixth and bloodiest coup attempt since she came to power 
in 1986. And the military academy is increasingly known as the institution that 
breeds coup plotters -- virtually all of the rebel leaders are graduates. 
Today, signs of dissent are everywhere. On the field, alumni line up by 
classes. None wear uniforms. Instead, members of the Class of '76 sport 
T-shirts emblazoned with "No Witchhunts," a protest of the post-coup-attempt 
arrest of a classmate. Members of the Class of '85, who are handing out 
leaflets demanding "National Discipline," wear semi-Fascist fashion: black 
shirts with khaki suits. That, too, seems appropriate. If they win, rebel 
leaders have said, their military junta will close all but one newspaper, one 
radio station and one TV station. The rebels also promise "a thorough cleansing 
of Philippine society." Most assume that means they will execute opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our class fought for the rebels, some for the government," Lt. Jun 
Kintanar, 26, president of the Class of '85, says of the December uprising. 
"Maybe we're just disillusioned. We see no purpose or direction. We see the 
need for reform. We need a strong leader. The question in our country is not do 
we want a democracy, but are we prepared for democracy? A lot of people abuse 
it. Or use it as a cloak for graft and corruption. The soldier must inculcate 
in his mind that the cause he's fighting for is worth dying for. The problem 
now is, the only cause is politics." 
</P>
<P>
Democracy is still new to the Philippines. It's only been four years since 
Aquino was swept into office by what has become known as the "people power 
revolution," a historic crusade that brought more than a million Filipinos into 
Manila's streets to end the despotic 20-year regime of President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos. Hailed as a secular Virgin Mary in this staunchly Roman Catholic 
country, she was the courageous widow and unassuming former housewife who won 
the world's heart as a symbol of nonviolence and democracy. In her words, the 
"dark night of tyranny" was over. 
</P>
<P>
Today, her successes are undeniable. Under Aquino, the Philippines has ratified 
a new constitution, restored a bicameral congress and elected thousands of 
provincial and local officials. Her administration has created an in dependent 
Supreme Court, rebuilt labor unions and unfettered what may be the world's most 
freewheeling press. Her military helped turn the tide on a 20-year communist 
insurgency. She began to privatize government-owned companies and repay a 
crushing $28-billion foreign debt. Until the last coup attempt, the 
</P>
<P>
economy was recovering steadily, if slowly. The country has a democracy, if a 
struggling one. 
</P>
<P>
But the profound social, economic and political problems that still plague the 
Philippines illustrate the squandered promise and growing predicament of Cory 
Aquino. She appears unable to appease or control a divided military and 
unwilling to crack down on government corruption. Inefficiency is so ingrained 
that tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid remain unspent while most rural 
areas lack even basic government services. And the president remains so devoted 
to her class and clan that she turns a blind eye to allegations of graft and 
nepotism within her own family. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most ominous, the devoutly Catholic president has refused to encourage 
any form of population control. An exploding birth rate already eats away at 
economic gains, and the population of 60 million is projected to double by the 
year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the nation already lives in what the World Bank has called 
"absolute poverty," with too little income to satisfy basic needs. In some 
rural areas, up to 80% of preschool children are malnourished. In Manila, 
millions live as squatters, crowded into dismal shanties without running water 
or sewerage. Thousands of others live on an infamous garbage dump called Smokey 
Mountain, picking trash for a living. And an estimated 75,000 street children 
struggle to survive as scavengers, vendors and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Aquino offers no answers and no excuses as she stands to address 
the cadets during graduation weekend in February. Another coup attempt is 
clearly foremost in her mind. "Let there be no doubt that when freedom is in 
danger, there are, and can be, no fence-sitters and opportunists among your 
ranks," she tells the men. "Never allow your idealism to be desecrated by those 
whose only desire is to grab power for selfish ends." 
</P>
<P>
Previous graduates, she says, gave their lives for democracy. They are "true 
heroes of the republic." She invokes the names of two men who were killed by 
communist rebels: Lt. Felix Brawner and Lt. Edgardo Dizon. It's a curious 
choice. Brawner's father, a retired general, has been charged in the latest 
coup attempt. And Dizon died in one of the most shameful episodes of Aquino's 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the Lupao massacre. 
</P>
<P>
LUPAO IS 90 MILES northeast of Manila, on the edge of the Caraballo Mountains 
in Nueva Ecija province. About 30,000 people live there, mostly tenant farmers 
eking out a living from dusty rice terraces in tiny villages. There is no 
irrigation, so most survive on one meager crop per year, giving a third of it 
to absentee landlords. Many eat but one meal a day. They collect wood from 
nearly denuded hillsides in the long, lean months. It is like countless other 
rural Philippine communities. 
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Dizon had just graduated from the Philippine Military Academy when he 
led 23 men, Alpha Company, of the 14th Infantry Battalion into one of Lupao's 
hamlets early on the morning of Feb. 10, 1987. Unknown to them, about two dozen 
communist commandos had taken over the cluster of bamboo-and-thatch huts the 
night before. Gunfire broke out as Dizon crossed a small bridge. He fell dead, 
shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
According to the President's Commission on Human Rights, which investigated the 
incident, Dizon's troops responded with a murderous two-hour frenzy. By the 
time the rampage was over, 17 villagers had been slaughtered, including a 
married couple in their 80s and six children younger than 12. A woman four 
months pregnant was shot four times in the back. The communist rebels escaped. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors' testimony is painful to read. Though Ernesto Carnate pleaded, 
"Stop shooting. We're all civilians," a soldier stabbed him in the chest. His 
daughter, Marilyn, watched in horror from a nearby hut. When a neighbor ran out 
with her 5-year-old brother, a soldier shot them both. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers then executed the elderly couple and a 4-year-old girl under a 
mango tree. Another group, including a 3-year-old boy, was found cowering in a 
rice paddy and was herded into a hut. They were shot from behind, most of them 
in the head. The soldiers then fired grenades into the huts, burning them so 
badly that the bodies inside were unidentifiable. Before leaving, the soldiers 
looted remaining huts of money, radios and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the investigation, the military claimed that 11 commandos were killed 
in a fire fight. Later, as the truth leaked out, soldiers said the dead and 
wounded civilians had been caught in the cross fire. Both the human rights 
commission and the military provost marshal general rejected that explanation. 
If Carnate was killed in cross fire, why did he suffer stab wounds? And why 
were seven charred bodies found huddled together, shot in the head and back? 
</P>
<P>
The provost called it a cover-up. After the initial killing, the soldiers 
"decided to kill everybody else so as to eliminate witnesses," his report said. 
"In order to hide this heinous crime, they further burned the houses . . . 
unknowing that there were survivors to tell the tale." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino flew to the village 10 days after the massacre to appeal to the grieving 
widows and orphans. "I want to talk to you personally and hear from your lips 
what really happened here," she said, her voice choked with emotion. "Help me. 
I hope you will trust me. Tell me what you know." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, 20 soldiers were charged with murder. In a 17-month 
court-martial, six survivors identified four members of Alpha Company as having 
led the massacre. But last May, after both prosecution and defense had rested 
their cases, three of the accused soldiers -- including two identified by 
witnesses -- suddenly asked to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
They testified that four other soldiers, who had come as reinforcements and had 
not been charged, had committed the atrocities. They gave no evidence, and 
their statements contradicted all previous testimony by the survivors and other 
soldiers. But on July 13, the six-member military tribunal met behind closed 
doors and unanimously acquitted the 20 soldiers of all charges. The witnesses' 
identification of the killers, the court said, was "inherently unprovable" and 
"against the natural course of things." The four other soldiers were never 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind the desk in his simple, second-floor office, Lupao's middle-aged 
mayor, George M. Castaneda, says the military paid families about $200 in 
restitution for each victim. His voice rises in anger. "It was a whitewash. The 
practice of the military -- they cover up all their mistakes. They tolerate 
wrongdoing. Once a soldier does something wrong, they just transfer him to 
somewhere else as punishment. Here, when there's a robber, one thing's for 
sure: He is a military man or an ex-military man." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin D. S. Limos, a lawyer who represented the victims, walks into Castaneda's 
office. He is 33, is soft-spoken and wears aviator glasses. A University of the 
Philippines graduate, he moved to Lupao from Manila to take the case and 
decided to stay. He says the verdict, which is not subject to appeal, haunts 
him. "I have total disbelief. I am totally frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Limos leads the way to the site of the slaughter, half a mile 
or so from the town hall. The killing field is abandoned now except for three 
caribou grazing amid tall weeds and broken concrete. A small wooden cross is 
planted near the tree where the elderly couple and young girl were shot. Why 
would soldiers kill civilians? "Maybe because their leader was killed," Limos 
says. "Or maybe because they came from the south, where it is very tough. 
Fighting, looting, killing and salvaging (torture) are normal there. They were 
used to doing anything they want." 
</P>
<P>
Limos heads across dusty brown fields to check on several survivors. He stops 
at a two-room hut with an earthen floor on the edge of a rice paddy. Marissa 
Gante lives here now with another family. She was 6 when her right hand was 
shot off and six members of her family were shot to death. She is 9 now but 
still in first grade. "The other children teased her," Limos explains. Marissa 
says nothing, hiding the stub of her arm in her lap. Another survivor, Rick 
Orentzia, 27, whose mother was killed, sits nearby but refuses to answer 
questions. "Witnesses were threatened," Limos says, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Marilyn Carnate, the girl who saw her father stabbed and 5-year-old 
brother shot, arrives. Now 17, she has one infant and is pregnant again beneath 
a torn cotton dress. "There was no justice," she says bitterly. "I testified at 
the trial. Those men should have been sent to jail." She says Aquino had 
promised justice when she visited Lupao. "What happened to her promise? She 
hasn't fulfilled her promise yet." 
</P>
<P>
THE PROMISE STARTED at EDSA, which is an acronym for the eight-lane Manila road 
where giant crowds massed for four days in February, 1986, to link arms, recite 
the rosary, block Marcos' tanks and throw the hated dictator out. A huge statue 
of the Virgin Mary now looms over the intersection where "people power" 
prevailed. It is Sunday, Feb. 25, and Aquino stands behind bulletproof glass at 
the shrine to address the fourth-anniversary celebration of what is always 
referred to in the Philippines simply as EDSA. The crowd of 30,000 is the 
smallest ever. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, she launched the celebration down the street by raising a flag 
outside Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame, the two military garrisons where the 
1986 revolt began. Before she arrived, an aide checked the honor guards' rifles 
to ensure that none was loaded. This afternoon, three Army helicopters clatter 
noisily back and forth over the crowd, dumping thousands of leaflets that extol 
the 1986 uprising. Since yellow has come to symbolize Aquino's quixotic 
campaign, many in the crowd wear yellow hats and T-shirts or wave yellow 
pennants and balloons bearing her picture. Brass bands blare and march about, 
while hundreds of nuns and priests quietly wait for a Mass to begin. A plane 
overhead trails a banner advertising "Peace, Justice and Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
People are cheerful, singing patriotic songs and munching boiled corn and 
peanuts. Many of them say they are government employees, encouraged by their 
department heads to attend. This is a middle-class crowd, still the core of 
Aquino's support despite daily battles with rising prices, chaotic public 
transit, water shortages and blackouts. The last coup attempt scared many back 
into Aquino's camp, primarily because they believe a military junta would be 
worse. "We have no alternative," explains Francisco Vegas, a 34-year-old 
railway worker. "It's been disappointing. But with Cory, we have hope. With 
Marcos, we were hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
A leftist group holds a much-used banner emblazoned with "No to U.S. Military 
Bases, No to U.S. Intervention." Carol Almeda, a 30-year-old government 
researcher, says she heads an anti-government group with 100,000 government 
employees as members. "We came to reach out to the Philippine masses," she 
explains. As people gather around her, she lists a long series of grievances 
and demands, ending with a call to nationalize "the oil and steel industry." 
What steel industry? "Actually, there is no steel industry," she concedes. 
"It's the principle that's important." 
</P>
<P>
Similar leftist groups have led an upsurge in anti-American feelings in the 
Philippines. Most of the anger is directed at upcoming talks to renegotiate 
leases for six U.S. military facilities. Six Americans associated with the 
military have been slain since 1987, presumably by communist guerrillas. As a 
result, U.S. troops are warned not to wear uniforms off base lest they become 
targets, while key embassy aides use new armor-plated cars. Still, I feel far 
safer than in New York. Last fall, when chanting student demonstrators burned a 
tattered U.S. flag at a Manila rally, two of the most strident rushed over to 
apologize when embers blew on my shirt. They were the politest protesters I had 
ever met. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner of the crowd, Andrew Casino, a 23-year-old law student, is trying 
to cash in on the attempted coup. He sells $4 T-shirts marked with a picture of 
a tank and the words, "I survived the 1989 coup d'etat in Manila." He says he 
has grossed $2,000 since December. He adds that he saved the silk screen in 
case he needs a 1990 version. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Paul Stephen R. Casino, 24, is assistant to the undersecretary of 
the Department of Trade and Industry. "After 20 years of Marcos, we didn't know 
what was going to happen when he left," says Paul, who is wearing one of 
Andrew's T-shirts. "Things have improved a little bit. Not as much as people 
expected in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That's why people are disappointed. They cannot gauge the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disappointed with Cory," he continues. "I'm disappointed with the 
government. They're like a bunch of clowns. It's not her fault. It's the 
problem with the Filipinos. You know what crabs are? When you put a bunch in a 
pail, and one climbs up, the others pull him down. Filipinos are like that. We 
pull each other down." 
</P>
<P>
Deeper in the crowd, George Guevara, 41, stands for the Mass with his wife, 
Marjorie. They have seven children, and he commutes two hours each way to his 
job as a telephone cable splicer. "It's tough," he says. "I have to stand in 
line and fight my way onto crowded jeepneys," the gaudily painted, elongated 
jeeps used for public transportation in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But Guevara hasn't lost faith in Aquino. "It's much better now," he says. 
Collective bargaining gave him a $75-a-month raise on top of his salary of 
about $500 a month, far more than he received under Marcos and 10 times the 
average Filipino's income. "I don't think it's fair to blame the president for 
the country's problems," he says. "And the coup leaders just want power. That's 
all. For me, I'm satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun sets, Aquino is on stage listing schools erected, houses built, 
wells dug, irrigation systems started. "Confidence is coming back," she tells 
the crowd. Then comes a blistering attack on her political nemesis, Sen. Juan 
Ponce Enrile. The two have feuded publicly ever since she fired him as defense 
chief in November, 1986, after his aides tried to launch a coup. Today, 
speaking in coarse Tagalog, Aquino mocks Enrile by name 17 times. "Be a man," 
she tells him, "or better yet, be a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she turns her contempt on her other chief critic, vice president and 
opposition leader Salvador (Doy) Laurel. "Do we have to talk about the fly 
anymore?" she says, dismissing him. The crowd laughs. 
</P>
<P>
A REAL FLY IS BUZZING at Aquino. It has invaded the heavily guarded Malacanang 
Palace Guest House, has flown upstairs and is divebombing the president of the 
Republic of the Philippines as she gives an interview. Sitting on a beige 
couch, she tries again and again to brush it away, then glares at half a dozen 
aides. One of them finally appears with a red fly swatter. He whacks the 
Philippine flag behind her, then smacks the wall near the presidential seal. 
Finally, he drops to his knees to extricate the dead insect from the deep, 
yellow-gold carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has had somewhat better luck swatting Enrile. Three days earlier, 
government agents had arrested him on charges of supporting the December coup 
attempt. The irony is delicious: As Marcos' martial law administrator in the 
1970s, Enrile jailed Aquino's late husband, Sen. Benigno (Ninoy) Aquino Jr., 
and thousands of others. Unlike Ninoy, who was held incommunicado for weeks 
after his arrest and served eight years in jail, Enrile conducted numerous 
press conferences during his incarceration (he was released on bail after a 
week). At one point, flanked by a mob of reporters and cameras, he complained, 
"I am cut off from the outside world." His "cell" was an air-conditioned 
two-room police office, complete with phones, an exercise bike, crates of fruit 
juice and his own bed and maid from home. 
</P>
<P>
"That is all right," the president says mildly, when asked about Enrile's 
gilded cage. "My goodness, this is a free country. And let him have access to 
the press." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino relaxes when asked if expectations were too high after 1986. Of course, 
she says, because the four-day "people power" revolt appeared so sudden and 
simple. But it wasn't. Opposition leaders worked hard for years. And, no, her 
own expectations were not too high. Before her husband was assassinated in 
1983, he had warned her. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that he felt sorry for whoever would come after Marcos because, given 
the many problems Marcos will leave behind, he would not be at all surprised if 
after six months in office, Marcos' successor will be booted out of office. So 
I knew what was in store for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have wanted it easier, of course," she continues. "My goodness, I am 
not a masochist. . . . And certainly I can look back to many accomplishments 
during my four years." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino ticks off the economic gains. Back in 1984-85, inflation rocketed to 
40%, factories closed, unemployment zoomed. "Before I took over, there was a 
feeling of hopelessness and helplessness," she adds. "Casting modesty aside, I 
was able to bring back hope." She has helped lower the percentage of the 
population living below the poverty line from 59% to 49%, she says, and is now 
aiming government programs at the bottom third of income earners. Another 
program will help small businesses and make credit more readily available to 
farmers' co-ops. "Hopefully, for the last two years of my term, we will be able 
not only to duplicate what we have done in the last four years but maybe do 
even more." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she says she's disillusioned. The last two coup attempts, the bloodiest 
and most disruptive, have "derailed" the gains. Her mistake, she says, was 
"trusting too much. Or being too patient insofar as my enemies are concerned." 
They took advantage of her. "I really set out on a program of reconciliation. 
And certainly I tried my best." There was the truce with communist rebels that 
collapsed in 1987 and the endless attempts to appease right-wing military 
officers who continue to try to overthrow her. 
</P>
<P>
"At a certain point, you realize there are some people who just don't want to 
be reconciled," she says emphatically. "But I really believe that I have bent 
over backward to enlist the support of as many of our people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The president wears a polka-dot beige dress (an aide says she now wears yellow 
only when she must; she prefers bright pink), simple pearl earrings and black 
pumps. She's 57 now, and her face is broader, framed by wide, silver-rim 
glasses and a new hairstyle, cropped close around the ears. She is warm and 
smiles easily. But she flashes in anger when asked if any members of her family 
have transgressed her own ethical standards. Five family members sit in 
Congress, and allegations of wrongdoing have dogged her wealthy and powerful 
younger brother, Rep. Jose (Peping) Cojuangco Jr. -- though none of the 
president's clan has been charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"My enemies will try everything and anything," she replies archly. "Even if 
they are not exactly honest in the matter of their criticisms." She cites her 
34-year-old daughter, Maria (Ballsy) Aquino Cruz, who is her personal 
secretary. Enrile has suggested that there was something improper about a 
Japanese businessman's letter, sent in care of the president's secretary, about 
a plan to sell Philippine-owned property in Tokyo. Aquino's answer is vehement; 
aides call it her "mother hen" response. "It's very clear," she says. "It is a 
very deliberate attempt to downgrade me and drag down as many innocent persons 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
I change the subject to Lupao. Why did she name Lt. Dizon in her military 
academy speech? "The first time that I went to the PMA, he was one of the 
graduates," she says, relaxing again. "And he was the first one who was killed 
after the graduation." 
</P>
<P>
Does she think justice was done in Lupao? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she replies. She recalls that she flew to Lupao "to find out directly 
from the residents what actually happened and what it was I could do for them." 
She says she helped them find land closer to town and later obtain title to the 
land. Medical aid and job training were provided. "And," she concludes, "the 
guilty were prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
But they were all acquitted, I say awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think so," she says. Then she pauses. "Let me check on that." She 
glances at her spokesman, Tomas (Buddy) Gomez III. "Buddy, could you check that 
for me?" 
</P>
<P>
I'm quite sure, I say, all the soldiers were acquitted last July. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll check on that," she says stiffly. (Gomez calls two days later to confirm 
the acquittals.) 
</P>
<P>
She disagrees strongly when told that many Filipinos say that only a strong, 
even an authoritarian, leader can solve the nation's problems. Marcos was 
strong, she points out, and he "sank us even faster." The problem has been the 
quick transition from dictatorship to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would like the benefits of an authoritarian government," she 
explains. "But at the same time, they would like to live under a democracy. I 
think it's really impossible for the two to go together." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Philippines should be seen as a "pilot country" for newly restored 
democracies. Don't "judge my leadership," Aquino says, until it can be compared 
to other fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe and to Nicaragua. "Certainly, 
I hope they would have it easier," she adds with a smile. "We do not want to 
wish the many problems that I've had on my counterparts." 
</P>
<P>
AQUINO'S "pilot country" is in serious trouble. A form of democratic anarchy 
prevails, and the ideals that brought her to power have faded. Sadly, her best 
hope of surviving may be the growing fear that what comes next may be much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
One need only visit the Malacanang Palace museum, where Marcos memorabilia is 
kept, to be reminded of what came before Aquino. Here are her predecessor's 
diapers and 4-inch platform shoes. And Imelda Marcos' 6,900 dresses and 1,220 
pairs of shoes (including a set of disco pumps with battery-powered flashing 
lights in the heels). There are two paintings of Imelda as Mona Lisa and one of 
an ethereal Imelda on the half-shell, grotesquely copied from Botticelli's 
"Birth of Venus." It is a testimonial to both bad government and bad taste.

It's unfair to blame Aquino for all her nation's woes, says Cardinal Jaime Sin, 
who sent nuns and priests to the streets to help oust Marcos in 1986. Marcos 
left behind an empty treasury, a bloated bureaucracy, a politicized military 
and institutional corruption. "We were able to expel Ali Baba," Sin says. "But 
the 40 thieves stayed. And now maybe there are only 20 thieves. So the 
situation has improved." 
</P>
<P>
But the improvements are often hard to see. Courts remain impossibly clogged, 
and judges are notoriously corrupt. Congress is more an obstacle than a 
catalyst for change. Alex Magno, a political scientist at the University of the 
Philippines, estimates that 30,000 bills now languish in Congress. "The 
legislative process is overloaded with meaningless legislation," he says. "A 
congressman wants to name a rural school after his father, and an opponent from 
a rival clan objects. So there are hearings and debates and testimony. And real 
change is put on endless delay." 
</P>
<P>
Blas Ople, a framer of the constitution and a member of the opposition 
Nacionalista Party, argues that the president must shoulder most of the 
responsibility. "She has a majority in both houses, but it's a meaningless 
majority," he says. "Every congressman and senator has his own agenda. And 
Aquino does not feel it necessary, well into her fourth year, to put together 
or submit any kind of legislative agenda. As a result, Congress is in a state 
of perpetual anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Jovita Salonga, the Senate president, insists that Congress only follows 
Aquino's lead. He blames "towering expectations" after 1986. "People thought, 
with freedom and democracy, graft and corruption would be rooted out, poverty 
would be eased, squatters would be housed. These were unreasonable 
expectations. But there were legitimate expectations that there would be 
greater efficiency in government, that graft and corruption would be 
substantially reduced and that there would be a higher moral tone in 
government. In these areas, where Cory should be strong, there is instead a 
sense of drift. There is a widespread perception that we have lost our 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find a vision or a sense of urgency in Aquino. As one of her 
former supporters in the military says, "She floats above all the problems." 
Most important, as in Lupao, she has little follow-through. In a hard-hitting 
speech in October, 1987, after the fifth failed coup attempt, Aquino complained 
that "it seems clear I must do nearly everything myself." She created a new 
"Action Committee, with a single member -- me." She sternly ordered officials 
to pick up Manila's garbage, fill in potholes, stop power shortages, improve 
telephone service and more. All in one week. Nothing happened. Manila's streets 
today are strewn with rotting garbage, axle-breaking potholes abound, the 
electricity fails regularly and telephone service takes months to install or 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's afraid of Cory," explains Tony Gatmaitan, a Manila businessman and 
economist. "That's her problem. Like most people, we Filipinos are like school 
kids. Since Cory came in, we've been on perpetual recess. She doesn't raise her 
voice, she doesn't slap our wrists, she doesn't stop us from running in and out 
and playing our games. She's powerless. We need an authoritarian figure." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the nation's plight is historical. More than 300 years as a Spanish 
colony left a feudal plantation economy, with an elite handful of landowners 
ruling impoverished rural peasants and governing by patronage and bribery. 
Another 50 years as a U.S. colony, until World War II, only reinforced the 
brutal land-tenure system and widened the gap between rich and poor. Marcos, 
first elected in 1965, merely replaced the old aristocracy with his own 
even-greedier friends. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Aquino promised that land reform, the key to solving rural poverty, would 
be the "centerpiece" of her administration. Instead, it has become an 
embarrassment. Rather than using her popularity to decree reform after she won 
office in 1986, she handed responsibility to the landlord-dominated Congress. 
The results were predictable: Barely 5% of available land has changed hands or 
title under the current loophole-riddled law. 
</P>
<P>
And the president's commitment stopped short at the heavily guarded borders of 
her family's 15,250-acre Hacienda Luisita sugar-cane plantation in central 
Luzon. The Cojuangco family used a loophole to give shares of stock, instead of 
land, to Hacienda Luisita's 7,000 workers. The family argued that breaking up 
the highly successful plantation -- which includes its own 18-hole golf course 
-- would only deprive workers of schools, clinics and other benefits. Polls 
showed that most of Hacienda Luisita's workers agreed. But critics called it a 
mockery of land reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Land reform was important precisely because she was landed," says Randy David, 
another political scientist at the University of the Philippines. "And I 
believe the Hacienda Luisita property would have made a difference, a great 
difference. It would have symbolized sincerity, compassion for the poor and a 
willingness to put national interests above traditional family ties. Instead, 
Hacienda Luisita became the best example of a callous and well-crafted evasion 
of the spirit of the law. So what do you expect other landlords to do? Instead 
of distributing land, they are distributing paper shares of stock in companies 
they (the workers) can never hope to control in any meaningful sense." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the 1986 "revolution" was actually a restoration of the powerful 
oligarchs, family dynasties and political bosses Marcos had dispossessed. 
Aquino's younger brother, Peping Cojuangco, is usually included on the list. A 
three-term congressman, he's known as a kind of political godfather, a man you 
see to get things done. At his home in Dasmarinas, one of Manila's richest 
suburbs, we sit in a den filled with a fortune in Asian antiquities. He's 55, 
quiet, intense and carefully groomed. He smokes and speaks slowly, particularly 
when asked about the endless allegations against his family. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all been insinuation," he says evenly. "They've actually tried to compare 
our family and the previous family (the Marcoses). There is a very big 
difference. Our family was in a strong position even before Cory became 
president." His brother was a bank president, another sister headed Manila's 
Far Eastern University. He himself was a mayor and two-term congressman in the 
1960s. "So we have had some form of success. We really don't need a president 
in the family to carry on." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he adds, feudalism is good for the Philippines. "They criticize us for 
a feudal system," he says. "Maybe someday we can eliminate it. But for the 
moment, the Philippine way of life is based on the family and feudal structure. 
I suppose it's because what every Filipino is looking for is security. And to 
band together behind a strong leader." 
</P>
<P>
ASSUMING NO further coup attempts -- and even Aquino's aides won't rule them 
out -- the Philippines will get its chance to choose a new leader in 1992, when 
democracy promises to run riot. Every elected position will be up for grabs. 
That includes president and vice president, 24 senators, 200 congressmen, 73 
governors and more than 50,000 provincial, local and village officials. 
</P>
<P>
Since Aquino said she won't run again, the early favorite is Defense Secretary 
Fidel V. Ramos, the terse, cigar-chomping West Point graduate who has stood by 
Aquino every time his military has mutinied against her. He is nationally 
respected, but many fear that he cannot control the divided military any better 
as president. House Speaker Ramon V. Mitra, better known for his white beard 
than his legislative leadership, also is angling for Aquino's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Laurel, the in-house critic who welcomed the December coup 
attempt as "democracy in its fullest and complete sense" and called for her 
resignation, wants to run. But his image as a buzzing gadfly draws little 
public support. Nor do many Filipinos back the ever-ambitious Sen. Enrile, who 
announced his candidacy during his short detention. 
</P>
<P>
Most intriguing is businessman Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco, Aquino's estranged 
cousin. He was the consummate Marcos crony, a stalwart of the deposed dictator 
who recently boasted -- probably accurately -- that his 200 or so companies 
once accounted for 25% of the Philippines' gross national product. He fled with 
Marcos to Hawaii in 1986 and then spent nearly four years in lonely exile in 
Long Beach, Calif. Suddenly, a week before the December uprising, he slipped 
back to Manila. He refuses to say how. 
</P>
<P>
Now, while his lawyers fight a slew of civil and criminal charges against him, 
the burly 54-year-old billionaire travels the country in his private plane, 
laying groundwork for a 1992 presidential bid. It is said that the world's 
richest Filipino is offering million-dollar fees and $50,000 race horses to key 
supporters. His campaign slogan is on pocket calendars: "BOSS: In bad times and 
in good." 
</P>
<P>
The bad times since the last coup attempt have already won Cojuangco converts, 
even among former Aquino loyalists. An Air Force general who remained faithful 
to her through every coup attempt says that he and many of his fellow officers 
have decided to back Cojuangco in 1992. The general says the country needs to 
fill its leadership void. 
</P>
<P>
"Power abhors a vacuum," he says. "She's not using her power, and that's the 
problem. . . . It's impossible to hate her. She's like a mother. But she's no 
president." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugs off Cojuangco's unsavory connections to Marcos. The euphoria of 
"people power" is long gone, he says. "Sometimes we Filipinos have very short 
memories," he explains patiently. "And the 1986 revolution is already fading 
into the mist of memory."
