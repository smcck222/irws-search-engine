<TEXT>
<P>
Hayley Mills reprises her dual roles as twins in Part 1 of Parent Trap III (NBC 
Sunday at 7 p.m.), a new romantic comedy airing in two parts on "The Magical 
World of Disney." (In the original 1961 "Parent Trap," Mills also played 
identical twins.) 
</P>
<P>
The lush, elegant Vincente Minnelli-Lerner &amp; Loewe musical Gigi airs on 
Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m. with Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice 
Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Remick, Marlee Matlin and Michael O'Keefe star in Bridge to Silence (CBS 
Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie about a hearing-impaired woman (Matlin, on 
the cover with Remick) who must rebuild her shattered life after a tragic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Reynolds and Jerry Orbach join Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale in Perry 
Mason: The Case of the Musical Murder (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV 
movie about a young stage manager (Jim Metzler) accused of murdering the 
director (Dwight Schultz) of a Broadway-bound musical in which Reynolds plays 
the leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
Romancing the Stone (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the delightful 1984 comedy in 
which a dowdy author of best-selling romances is plunged into adventures beyond 
her wildest imaginings -- with Michael Douglas as her breezy, rugged leading 
man. Director Robert Zemeckis and writer Diane Thomas have pulled off an 
amusing reworking of genre conventions. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodbye Girl (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is quintessential Neil Simon: 
slick, sentimental, well turned out and entertaining. In this diverting 1977 
comedy directed by Herbert Ross, Marsha Mason plays a Broadway dancer whose 
male friends have a chronic tendency to bid her farewell -- until her latest ex 
sublets his portion to struggling actor Richard Dreyfuss (who won an Oscar for 
his comic portrayal), with whom she immediately clashes. You can take it from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Resurrection (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a captivating, unjustly 
neglected 1980 film dealing with the possibility of healing by love, which is 
not precisely the same thing as healing by faith. Ellen Burstyn plays a woman 
who recovers from a near-fatal auto accident and is transformed by strange new 
powers, including the power to heal. Written by Lewis John Carlino and directed 
by Daniel Petrie, the film also features Sam Shepard and Eva Le Galliene, who 
are as impressive as Burstyn. 
</P>
<P>
Whoopi Goldberg stars as a pool-hustling mother in the romantic comedy Kiss 
Shot (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie that co-stars Dorian Harewood, 
Dennis Franz and Tasha Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Hardbodies (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), whose title refers to the "scores 
of sexy girls" who hang out at the local beaches, is a crass, hard-boiled, 
voyeuristic 1984 movie ostensibly geared to the teen market. Sorrells Pickard, 
Gary Wood and Michael Rapport star as three middle-aged men who rent a beach 
house to surf, sun and score; the result is a muddled and infantile male 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The Return of the Shaggy Dog, Part 1 (ABC Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 1987 TV 
movie sequel to the 1959 Disney hit. This time villains steal a magic ring 
which has the power to turn a young attorney into a big dog. The film concludes 
next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Alamo (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is the ponderous 1960 Western epic in 
which John Wayne directed as well as starred. The attack on the fortress is 
impressive but it takes a long while to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is a 
tragicomic meditation on the Baker Street duo, in which Billy Wilder shrewdly 
fills in the spots that Conan Doyle left blank: Holmes' failures, his sex life 
and the motives for his cocaine habit. Robert Stephens is Sherlock, Colin 
Blakely is Watson, and the movie is one of Wilder's least cynical and most 
romantic, a sadly elegant celebration of gaslit sleuthery. All this comes 
through even though the 1970 film, a prime candidate for restoration, was cut 
from its roadshow length prior to release. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Ulmer's 1945 film noir classic Detour (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) 
is a perfect late-night show, one of the most relentlessly intense 
psychological thrillers ever filmed. Tom Neal and Ann Savage star. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be missed: Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's "The Unknown Chaplin" 
(Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.), a three-hour study which allows us to see how 
the master painstakingly developed his gags. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzan in Manhattan (CBS Saturday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie in which the 
Edgar Rice Burroughs character searches New York for hunters who kidnaped 
Cheetah.

WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD MARKMAN MD and DOMINICK BOSCO, From Alone With the Devil: Famous 
Cases of a Courtroom Psychiatrist, to be published in May by Doubleday. Markman 
examined Manson Family members Tex Watson and Leslie Van Houten for their 
trials. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Though I wanted to see the Tate-LaBianca murderers punished, I had to advise 
the prosecution that in my opinion there was evidence of diminished capacity.' 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW makes fine distinctions between types of killings, and the mental 
states required for each type have sophisticated differences. From the mid 
1960s through the 1970s, the distinctions in California were even more refined 
than most. At the time of the Manson trial, in California, case law stated that 
first-degree murder required not only a state of mind capable of premeditation, 
deliberation and harboring malice but also one that was able to meaningfully 
and maturely reflect on the gravity of the act. 
</P>
<P>
Though, as a citizen, I wanted to see the Tate-LaBianca murderers punished, as 
much as anyone did, I had to advise the prosecution that in my opinion there 
was evidence of diminished capacity, at least according to California law at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
When Leslie Van Houten and Tex Watson and the others committed the crimes, 
their brains were literally pickled in drugs. They were taking all kinds -- 
LSD, amphetamines, pot, downers and others. A person taking the kinds of drugs 
the family did would almost automatically have lacked the mental capacity to 
meaningfully and maturely premeditate, deliberate and reflect upon the gravity 
of the act. Therefore, if this psychiatric information had been carried over 
into the legal decision, a first-degree murder conviction would not have been 
possible. In Leslie's case, I further believed that she was so spaced out that 
she might have also lacked the mental capacity to harbor malice. Without malice 
having been established, she could be found guilty of only manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the defense team had learned of my opinion. The law requires 
that the prosecution inform the defense of any and all evidence, pro or con, 
that it gathers. Failure to do so is a reversible error, which means that an 
appeals court could throw out the conviction and order a retrial. So I met with 
the defense team and told them what I thought, and they decided to put me on 
the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
I was troubled because I knew that my testimony could increase the likelihood 
that the killings would go insufficiently punished. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to carry through on the logic, what person who kills another person 
can meaningfully and maturely reflect upon the gravity of the act? The greatest 
thinkers of every age in human history have labored over "meaningfully" 
reflecting upon the gravity of death. Were we to demand the same level of 
philosophical and psychological maturity of every killer? 
</P>
<P>
The courts at that time were. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing my opinion, the prosecution naturally didn't want to use me in court. 
They were going for first-degree murder convictions and didn't want a 
psychiatrist on the witness stand who was going to say that the defendants were 
not mentally capable of committing first-degree murder. However, I suggested 
that they charge them with first-degree murder committed during the course of 
another felony, in this case robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie and her companions had stolen some food and household articles from the 
LaBianca home. The law said that a killing committed during the course of a 
robbery did not require malice or deliberation and premeditation to be 
first-degree murder. I advised the prosecution that the defendants most 
certainly did have the mental capacity for robbery; that is, to permanently 
deprive an owner of property. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution chose not to go that route at Leslie's second trial. They 
wanted to hit hard and win on pure first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they were encouraged by the result in Tex Watson's trial. In that case, 
I had examined him and told his attorney that in my opinion, despite his 
drug-induced haze, Tex had the mental capacity to harbor malice but lacked the 
ability to meaningfully and maturely reflect on the gravity of his crimes. This 
would have reduced his level of responsibility from first- to second-degree 
murder. I testified to that effect -- but the jury did not let my testimony 
sway them. Watson was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
But in Leslie's second trial it didn't work out that way. As a matter of fact, 
the jury almost set her free! Half the jury wanted to convict her of 
manslaughter. Since she had already served enough time in prison for 
manslaughter, she would have walked out of the courtroom a free woman. But the 
other half was just as adamant about convicting her of murder. So, lacking the 
unanimous verdict that is required, we got a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
For the third trial, the prosecutor decided to go for murder in the course of a 
robbery. The defense, of course, knew the prosecutor's plans. I advised the 
defense attorneys not to use me. I would continue to say that Leslie did not 
have the mental capacity to harbor malice or meaningfully or maturely reflect. 
But if asked whether she had the mental capacity for robbery, I would answer 
yes. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's attorneys decided to take the gamble anyway. They put me on the stand 
as a defense witness. When the prosecutor's chance to cross-examine me came up, 
sure enough, I was asked the question, "Did Leslie Van Houten have the mental 
capacity to commit robbery?" I answered yes. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was convicted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the "meaningful and mature" rule that allowed many murderers to go 
free with little or no punishment, and almost did the same for some of the 
Manson Family murderers, was rescinded by the "victim's bill of rights." 
Murderers no longer have to be philosophers. Today, the testimony I gave them 
would not have diminished their capacity or legal responsibility one bit.

KENNETH WALKER'S genuine Architectural Cookie Cutters bring closet architects 
into the kitchen. His Manhattan-based architectural firm, WalkerGroup/CNI, 
specializes in retail design projects such as Bloomingdale's in Boca Raton, 
Fla., and prototypes for Lucky supermarkets in California. His L.A. office is 
currently working on the design for the retail and food facilities for 
Universal Studios Florida, Entertainment Attraction, in Orlando. Such a serious 
career needs occasional comic relief: The chance came last year when Walker 
attended a meeting at the Museum of Modern Art. He happened to bring along some 
mockups of famous-building-inspired cookie cutters he'd created in 1983. A 
product developer for MOMA's sales department was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the six cookie cutters in the MOMA-produced series is modeled after a 
landmark building: the Sydney Opera House; the chapel of Notre-Dame du Haute in 
Ronchamp, France; Chicago's Sears Tower; and, in New York, the Chrysler 
Building, the TWA Terminal at Kennedy Airport and the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum. An Ohio craftsman makes the cookie cutters from tin. 
</P>
<P>
Walker is now preparing sets of cookie cutters based on the states. For 
California, he's chosen the gingerbread-Victorian Carson House in Eureka, the 
Transamerica Building in San Francisco and L.A.'s Tail 'o the Pup hot dog 
stand. Clearly, Walker's brainchild appeals to architecture's friends and foes 
alike. As Walker puts it, "If you don't like Frank Lloyd Wright, you can eat 
him."

<P>
While I do enjoy Modern Maturity and acknowledge the efforts of AARP in getting 
legislation passed to benefit senior citizens, I also feel that AARP exists 
primarily to promote their revenue-producing services. 
</P>
<P>
I am not eligible for Medicare and have no health insurance through employment. 
I wrote to AARP for clarification of their so-called health insurance, which, 
(I conclude) from reading the slick advertisements, covers only an 
insignificant amount while in the hospital and does not mention anything about 
actual medical and doctor expenses. I never had a reply.

EMPIRE OF THE OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your toadying article on the American Assn. of Retired Persons ("Empire of the 
Old," by David DeVoss, Feb. 12) was sickening. This is the group that supported 
the Catastrophic Coverage Act and was responsible in great part for its 
passing. This detrimental act is costing seniors millions of dollars in extra 
taxes each year at rates to increase annually. 
</P>
<P>
AARP is also the organization that was against equitable Social Security 
payments for "notch babies" (born 1917-1921), who can get $100 less monthly 
than those born before or after. 
</P>
<P>
Your cover picture and title, "Empire of the Old," should have been titled 
"Empire of the Gold." AARP leadership and officers are not helping members, 
merely themselves.

Fine and dandy that you gave AARP a tremendous amount of publicity. However, I 
do not feel that this organization is living up to its original intent. 
</P>
<P>
Buy their car insurance: It keeps going up and up, and we who are on a fixed 
income feel that AARP car insurance is in competition with other insurance 
companies. I called to complain and was told that if I was not satisfied, I 
should look elsewhere.

I hope I never reach the age when I look forward to reading AARP's mindless 
magazine, Modern Maturity. AARP claims to be interested in the economics of us 
old folks, but when I sent for an insurance quote from a company they endorsed, 
I found it to be $1,000 a year more than I now pay. 
</P>
<P>
If AARP is my salvation for old age, I'll just continue on my own, thanks.

Re Gene Simmons' April 2 letter: 
</P>
<P>
Though I've yet to be fully persuaded that rock critics are a necessity, 
Simmons' harsh attitude toward them is unsurprising and actually kind of funny. 
</P>
<P>
You see, in the broad scope of rock 'n' roll culture (which is a critic's main 
concern), Kiss doesn't matter, never did and never will. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons counted his coins and decided he does matter; but he should remember 
that Pat Boone also was a millionaire many times over and his artistic 
contributions haven't mattered a whit. 
</P>
<P>
The big reason Simmons and his ilk get dismissed by the critics is their 
embarrassing lack of originality. For example, he wrote in his letter that the 
reason critics love Elvis Costello "is that most critics look like Elvis 
Costello." It's the wittiest thing Gene Simmons has ever written, and it was 
coined years ago by David Lee Roth.

MARKOWITZ'S MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone at Calendar either has a peculiarly nasty sense of humor or has simply 
not been paying attention. Allowing Charles Markowitz to write about a 
playwright is like asking a skinhead to do a piece on the local rabbi ("When 
Reel and Real-Life Merge Into One Image," April 2). 
</P>
<P>
Markowitz has built a career by expressing his contempt for playwrights, 
assaulting script after script in exercises that resemble drive-by shootings 
more than productions. 
</P>
<P>
There may be legitimacy to this approach to theater, but it makes him a curious 
choice to do an article on any playwright, much less Tom Stoppard. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't ask The Times to protect playwrights (Lord knows that critic Dan 
Sullivan isn't much help), but when a writer's bias is so extreme as 
Markowitz's, you're only asking for incompetence; Markowitz delivers.

In early copies of the April 9 Calendar, David Link's letter contained an 
incorrect article reference, the result of an editing error. Link's letter was 
about Charles Marowitz, the author of an April 2 article on playwright Tom 
Stoppard, not about Robert Markowitz, who also had an article in the issue.

Carr had the media around the country, most especially the Los Angeles Times, 
eating out of the palm of his hand. He was seen and heard everywhere promoting 
an Oscar show that was supposed to be spectacular and full of surprises. There 
were none, and it was a typically boring awards show.

In 1939, my late father, Leo Shuken, won the Academy Award for scoring 
"Stagecoach." Since then, I have been proud that the motion picture academy was 
part of my family's history. 
</P>
<P>
I was not proud when I watched the awards ceremony, which was shown all over 
the world and for the first time in the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
I recognize that the friendly public chiding of our leaders and political 
satire in general are parts of our legacy of free speech. But to mock and 
denigrate the vice president of the United States in front of other (even 
hostile) nations and cultures is not an acceptable part of that legacy.

Carr deserves a "raspberry" despite all the misplaced accolades he has received

TV'S BLOOD MONEY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time I viewed murder on film as a morbid oddity at which you might 
sneak a look under a sideshow tent. That was until it took someone close to me. 
</P>
<P>
Let me assure anyone who's slightly curious that there's nothing remotely 
glamorous or fascinating about an experience that's so completely cold and 
devastating as homicide. 
</P>
<P>
It bothers me that the American public is so preoccupied with murder. But 
what's more unsettling are the producers who feign sympathy about "those 
dreadful days we all shared" as they take their blood money to the bank 
("Murder Most Glamorized," by Peter H. Brown, April 2). Thanks to Peter Brown 
for exposing this network of exploitative sensationalism.

A HEALTH-RISK PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WE KNOW. YOU are tired of using your computer to write fawning letters to your 
creditors or to print out the embarrassing totals of your own net worth. You 
want a program that tells you something about your own life. 
</P>
<P>
OK, here it is: a health-risk-analysis program, devised by a Kansas doctor and 
based on a questionnaire developed by the Centers for Disease Control, in 
Atlanta. You answer 51 health, hereditary and life-style questions posed by the 
program, and it in turn variously computes your physical age (as opposed to 
your chronological age) and the top 12 factors most likely to kill you. 
</P>
<P>
Using the program is like taking a multiple-choice test. It asks for your age, 
race, sex, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol count, marital status 
and occupation. It inquires how many miles you drive each year, whether you use 
a seat belt, pick up hitchhikers, carry a gun for self-protection, indulge in 
high-risk entertainment or argue with strangers. It asks smokers how many 
cigarettes they smoke each week and beer drinkers how many bottles of beer they 
drink. It asks if your parents had diabetes or died young from heart attacks or 
strokes. It asks whether you've lost your job during the last year, been in 
jail, divorced your spouse or suffered the death of someone dear. 
</P>
<P>
When it's done, it prints out a tidy little chart, listing in descending order 
of importance the 12 factors most likely to kill you (such as heart disease, 
lung cancer, cirrhosis, suicide, stroke and motor vehicle accidents). It tells 
you how many years you could knock off your current physical age if you take 
the program's advice: "You're 23% overweight. Your desirable weight is 158." 
Finally, the program tells you your chances of dying in the next 10 years -- 
5,916 out of 100,000, say. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the program, which was originally designed to be used by doctors 
at health fairs, is to get people to change their high-risk behavior. And if 
you don't like its predictions, you can experiment with changing your answers 
to see how it affects your chances of living through the next decade. (Warning: 
This program verges on the traumatic for people who smoke, drink or had parents 
who died young.)

FCC HAS TO REVISE ITS DEFINITION OF 'EFFECTIVE' COMPETITION AS THE CABLE 
INDUSTRY MATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the 1987 deregulation of the cable television industry hasn't been a 
benefit to consumers, as deregulation of many other industries has. The Times' 
balanced article ("Rising Rates Bring Cable Firms Static From Public," March 
19) cited the rising costs and stagnant services. But at least where the Los 
Angeles metropolitan area is concerned, I believe one major factor in consumer 
complaints was overlooked in the story: If reception quality is at all 
important, most people probably have little choice but to become cable 
subscribers -- and therefore particularly frustrated with the industry's 
vagaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communication Commission's standard for deregulating cable service 
in a community is the existence of at least three over-the-air television 
signals serving the same area. But in the many places I've lived in Los Angeles 
and Orange Counties, I've never had effective over-the-air reception. And for 
the large and ever-growing population of apartment dwellers, rooftop antennae 
are not an option. I doubt I am alone in subscribing to basic cable service 
simply for quality reception. The FCC should revise its definition of 
"effective" competition.

IN EUROPE, TIME TO GIVE PEACE A CHANCE, COMBINING NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Mueller, John Mueller, a professor of political science at the 
University of Rochester, is the author of Retreat From Doomsday: The 
Obsolescence of Major War (Basic Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROCHESTER, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The major countries of Europe have now been at peace with one another for the 
longest continuous stretch since the days of the Roman Empire. A truly 
substantial crisis has not been witnessed for more than a quarter-century. 
Therefore it may now be time to take this remarkable phenomenon -- peace -- 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
While major war in Europe is not impossible in the foreseeable future, it seems 
far from heroic to assume it to be wildly improbable. Since the consequences of 
even a non-nuclear major war would be horrendous, it is sensible to be 
concerned about it even if its likelihood is slight. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the probabilities get low enough, a relaxation of concern 
even about calamity begins to become justified. A nuclear war between Britain 
and France, or between either (or both) and the United States would be 
catastrophic but, because of its low probability, none of these once-hostile 
countries spends much time, effort, money or psychic energy guarding against 
the danger. 
</P>
<P>
The chances of a war between East and West may not be that low, but they are 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
Although unprecedented peace has prevailed in Europe since 1945, there remain 
serious unresolved problems on that once-warlike Continent. Chief among them 
are an unnatural division into two camps and the anachronistic empire the 
Soviet Union has forced upon unwilling peoples in Eastern Europe. These 
problems might best be resolved by confederating the alliances; the conditions 
may now be favorable for probing such an unorthodox solution. 
</P>
<P>
The division of Europe is built around two alliances arrayed in military 
opposition. If war is no longer a realistic possibility, the two alliances are 
essentially unnecessary. Equally unnecessary is the Soviet Union's empire. 
Today, Eastern Europe is probably an economic burden on the Soviet Union and 
its military usefulness in the days of long-range missiles and diminished 
threat of war is highly questionable. Ideological justifications for the empire 
can still be spun out, of course, but ideology is in pronounced decline in the 
Soviet Union, particularly when it runs up against unpleasant economic 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
The logical outcome of all this would be a gradual evisceration of the costly 
and useless alliances and empire -- a sort of continentwide Finlandization or 
Austrianization as each country wanders off to pursue its independent destiny. 
</P>
<P>
There are two major problems with such a development, however. One concerns 
Germany. Without the involvement of the United States and the Soviet Union, 
Germany would be the most formidable country in Central Europe. Given the 
history of the last century or two, it is too easy to visualize, on the one 
hand, eventual conflict or war between two independent Germanys, or, on the 
other, a reunification of the two entities leading eventually to hegemonic 
domination, militarization and war. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these dire possibilities may be very likely. With the experience of 
two world wars behind them, however, it is understandable that the Soviets (and 
many others) would want an arrangement keeping Germany permanently under wraps. 
The current arrangement in Europe may be absurd, inefficient and unjust, but at 
least seems to guarantee that Germany can be forever prevented from again 
perpetrating a major war on its own. Any resolution of the European situation 
should need to include a similar perpetual -- or at least seemingly perpetual 
-- guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with an abandonment of the alliances is that it would leave the 
Soviet Union, even if there were significant arms reductions, as the dominant 
military entity in the area. Clearly, an attractive plan for a lasting 
resolution of the European situation should guard against the possibility of 
Soviet domination. 
</P>
<P>
Since it would allow for the potential rise of German revanchism, the 
withdrawal of the United States and the Soviet Union from effective 
participation in the affairs of Central Europe should be an element within any 
effective resolution of the divisions and discontinuities of the Continent. 
Since it would allow for the potential Soviet domination of Europe, the 
withdrawal of the United States from the affairs of the area is additionally 
undesirable; a solution should keep the American counterweight in place. 
</P>
<P>
An economic blending of West and East could be part of a solution. But mutual 
economic dependency has been no guarantee against war in the past. Political 
and military dependency is also necessary; this could be accomplished with most 
direct dispatch by combining the two alliances. If Britain and France can be 
linked in an alliance, so perhaps can the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, of course, any confederation of the alliances would feel awkward and 
peculiar. It could begin with political consultations and lead to a rough 
coordination of military planning. (The Voice of America is far more likely to 
bring about a collapse of the Soviet regime than is the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. VOA will soon have an office in Moscow; why can't NATO?) The role 
of France within NATO might form something of a model -- French forces are not 
integrated under joint command but they are coordinated with those of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Bases or training camps might even be exchanged eventually, something that 
perhaps can now be contemplated after the sanctity of bases has been violated 
by inspectors from the enemy alliance under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces 
Treaty. The bases would be at once guarantors of cooperation and hostages to 
it. This might lead in time to joint command in places and then to judicious, 
balanced and overdue arms reduction in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, alliances have often been formed as much to control allies as to 
confront potential enemies. In a modern confederation, the goal would be to 
create a situation in which every country in the area feels it has some control 
over the military destiny of every other country and, specifically, one 
allowing both the United States and the Soviet Union to maintain control over 
the military potential of the two Germanys. Under that circumstance a 
relaxation of the Soviet Union's grip on its useless and costly empire in East 
Europe would be entirely feasible, as would an eventual German confederation. 
Without such a resolution to the German problem, Soviet colonies will be able 
to pry themselves free only by causing dangerous unease in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A plan that promises at once to solve the German problem and to remove their 
East European albatross is likely to have substantial appeal to the Soviets. 
And a plan that promises gradually to decolonize East Europe is likely to 
reduce Soviet problems in that area by relieving the frustration of Eastern 
Europeans and giving them a future to work for. To accept the plan, however, 
the Soviets would have to abandon any hegemonic notions they might still 
cherish about Europe. If they are still Stalinists at heart, they won't be able 
to buy the idea. If they've genuinely changed, they will. It would be a useful 
test.

WHEN CIVILIZATION RAN AGROUND ABOARD THE OIL TANKER IN ALASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Nelson, Richard Nelson is an Alaskan anthropologist and nature 
writer, whose book, The Island Within, will be published this fall by North 
Point Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JUNEAU, ALASKA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live on the Northwest Pacific coast. Although Prince William Sound is 
hundreds of miles away, its oil-covered waters now seem perilously close. 
Sister tankers to the Exxon Valdez have passed here daily for 12 years, hidden 
just beyond the horizon. Until last week I rarely gave them a thought. 
</P>
<P>
My surroundings are much like those near Cordova and the other Prince William 
Sound communities: forested mountains rising sheer above islands and bays; 
violent Pacific storms shrouding the coast in clouds and rain; the land and 
waters filled with a staggering abundance of life. 
</P>
<P>
At this time of year, herring mass to spawn along the shores and fingerling 
salmon pour out from rivers and hatchery pens. Drawn by the abundant feed are 
humpback whales, sea lions, spotted seals, killer whales, harbor porpoises and 
thousands of sea birds -- gulls, ducks, cormorants, kittiwakes, auklets, 
murres, murrelets, grebes, loons and bald eagles. There are few places on earth 
where nature remains so pristine and exuberant. 
</P>
<P>
This was true of Prince William Sound until this year. Like other Americans, my 
neighbors and I have watched the tragedy unfold on nightly newscasts: the oil 
slick covering 30 square miles, 100, 200, 500, then 1,000 square miles, sludge 
pluming into the open Pacific, heading toward Kenai Fjords National Park and 
the rich waters of Cook Inlet. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us living along this coast are fishermen of one sort or another -- 
commercial, sport or subsistence. What corn and wheat are to Midwestern 
farmers, salmon and halibut are to people here. Now, with brutal suddenness, 
the residents of Prince William Sound face the equivalent of a year in farm 
country without a drop of rain; and worse, the possibility that many more will 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
In a state often deeply divided over environmental issues, an uncommon unity of 
opinion has emerged. Alaskan editorial pages and radio talk shows are filled 
with grief and indignation. Blame is assigned first to an arrogant and 
unprepared oil industry, then to an ineffective and unresponsive government and 
then to a more tangible scapegoat -- the captain who tested legally drunk after 
his tanker struck Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, I was living in Santa Barbara when the first great American oil spill 
came ashore. Like thousands of others, I walked the blackened beaches and 
clambered across lathered rocks, an act of curiosity but also of conscience, as 
if simply being there and showing concern might help. 
</P>
<P>
And then I found a bird, hiding among kelp and boulders just above the tide. A 
western grebe, big as a mallard, long-necked, with a slender needle beak, 
half-submerged in a puddle of mixed oil and water. 
</P>
<P>
I have forgotten how much it cost to clean up the spill in Santa Barbara 
Channel, how those who suffered damages were compensated, how blame was 
decided, how punishment was administered, how many animals were calculated to 
have died and how many were saved. But one memory holds forever -- that dying 
bird, feathers matted and shining with oil, wings drooped, body quivering. 
</P>
<P>
She stared up at me, blinking bright red eyes, the one part that still seemed 
fully alive. Caught in the bird's unwavering gaze, I could not escape my own 
feelings of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Now it has happened again, and far worse this time, on a wilderness coast 
populated with incalculable numbers of fish, sea birds, mammals and a diverse 
array of other marine life. Each day I am haunted by images of birds setting 
their wings to land in the morass of crude. And I think of sea otters, those 
clever and energetic creatures who add such brightness to my days, crawling out 
to drape themselves on oil-soaked rocks and await a slow death. Prince William 
Sound has become a dying grounds, filled with thousands of animals, each one 
another story like the doomed grebe I found 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now, arguments over who is responsible shift from the courts of public opinion 
to the courts of law. By assigning blame we may find satisfaction. But will the 
legal process identify who is truly guilty? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for the Prince William Sound disaster rests not just on oil 
companies, not just on government, not just on an intoxicated ship captain. 
Ultimately, you and I must accept our share of blame -- as members of a society 
that understood the risks and judged them acceptable. A society that valued 
convenience and monetary gain above the security of its own environment. A 
society that placed nature outside the sphere of ethical concern and moral 
restraint. We belong to a society much like the tanker in Prince William Sound, 
laden with an enormous deadly cargo, making its way through treacherous waters 
with impaired judgment at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
And who will pay for the Prince William Sound disaster? You and I. We will 
cover the cost to government when we pay taxes. We will cover the cost to the 
oil industry when we buy fuel or anything made with petroleum products. The 
notion that someone else will pay is an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
There is yet another cost to us, one far greater and more consequential. The 
natural world of Prince William Sound is not just scenery; it is a vital part 
of our continent's living community, a community that supplies the air we 
breathe and the food we eat. Any wound to that community diminishes the 
environment we depend upon for every moment of our lives, takes away from its 
capacity to sustain us, whether we live near the disaster or far away. As we 
learn more about the connections among all things, we realize that damage in 
one place is damage to the environment everywhere. We are a part of what we 
have destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental officer for the Exxon Corp. asserted that the Alaskan oil 
spill is "the price of civilization." What we have lost may never be regained. 
As a society, we must agree that we will no longer accept this price. Never 
again. 
</P>
<P>
I choose those words deliberately. The enslavement and extermination of racial 
and ethnic groups in Europe and America is a deep stain on our collective 
memory. Behavior our society once condoned has now literally become 
unthinkable. Abraham Lincoln said, "If slavery is not wrong, then nothing is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's plea for a moral conscience that embraces all peoples eventually 
became the law and practice of our land. We must now recognize the need for a 
further growth of moral conscience, to encompass the whole community of life -- 
the environment that nurtures, uplifts senses and sustains our existence. 
</P>
<P>
Future generations will look back on our behavior toward the environment -- the 
enslavement and extermination of species who share the world with us -- and 
judge it unthinkable.

So the grandchildren aren't living as well as the grandparents -- what's wrong 
with that? 
</P>
<P>
Today's "children" want it all, now. Mom and dad did not start out with what 
they now have. They worked hard for it. 
</P>
<P>
Their children want $300,000-$400,000 homes with a BMW in the driveway, not 
what Ms. Goodman calls "affordable" housing. 
</P>
<P>
Great, let's get rid of Proposition 13 and tax old mom and dad right out of 
their home. After all, if the kids can't live in the manner in which they are 
accustomed why should the old folks?

"The family home sits on an unfair tax base" with widely varying assessments up 
and down the block, the result of a taxpayer revolt against being taxed on 
paper profits by tax-omnivorous public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed solution? 
</P>
<P>
Since the stay-putters (Stall's term) aren't willing to give up the benefits of 
Proposition 13, knowing that to do so would move much of the middle-class 
slowly but surely into the "homeless" category, why not sneak up on them by 
letting "stay-putters' homes to grow at a slightly faster rate than the present 
maximum 2%, but keep them capped at a reasonable rate. . . . The equity gap 
would be closed over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a progressive repeal of Proposition 13.

UNFAIR PROPERTY TAX BASE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John J. Curtis' column on Proposition 13 ("Equalize Property Taxes, and 
California Can Put Humpty Together Again," Op-Ed Page, March 22) really struck 
a chord. By taxing properties with the same market value at greatly disparate 
levels, Proposition 13 rewards those able to buy before property values 
skyrocketed and punishes latecomers. The young first-time buyer pays not only 
his share of taxes, but that of the properties that have not changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Proposition 13 has provided a strong disincentive to sell, since 
only those unlucky to be young and buying for the first time are willing to pay 
the current reassessed tax levels. Such a disincentive artificially shrinks the 
housing supply, thus driving prices even higher. 
</P>
<P>
This scheme has allowed current property owners to pull the ladder up on my 
generation. A young family today sees the staggering cost of owning a home 
coupled with Proposition 13's "reassessed" property tax as a truly 
insurmountable hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
Up to this point, the young have been quiet. Many are still in school or live 
at home; our interests in these matters have yet to be vested. But with each 
passing day it becomes clearer and clearer that our profligate elders have 
enjoyed 40 post-war years of good living and passed the bill to us. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, we're not going to take it anymore.

The true reason why "young people under 35 cannot afford to own their own homes 
these days unless they have double income or they could get financial aid from 
their parents" ("This Generation Gap Is Built on Real Estate" by Ellen Goodman, 
Op-Ed Page March 29) is: Because, "Over the past 15 years, income fell behind 
inflation and houses sped ahead" (as Ms. Goodman stated), but not because their 
hard-working parents built "their good fortune by investing their savings into 
real estate." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the average annual income was one-third of the average house 
price. Today, average annual income is only one-tenth of the average house 
price. Our government should face the fact of this "inflation" and raise the 
minimum wage to $15 per hour. Then, competitive business employers will raise 
their employees' average annual salary to the level of $100,000, or one-third 
of the average house price "these days." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to squeeze "parents' good fortune" to solve the problem, as Ms. Goodman 
suggests ("tax more of the capital gains that came to those who rode the 
real-estate boom"), would be an incorrect method to solve the fundamental 
economic problem, just as our government has tried and failed, without facing 
the true cause "over the past 15 years."

INTRUSIVE DRUG TESTS MAY MAKE CIVIL LIBERTIES POPULAR AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL H. PILLSBURY, Samuel H. Pillsbury is an associate professor of law at 
Loyola Law School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years the American public and the U.S. Supreme Court have held the 
Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures in low 
esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Neither body has cheered a doctrine that excludes important evidence from 
criminal trials because of how the police found it. Politicians have made 
careers attacking such "legal technicalities." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Supreme Court has issued a series of decisions cutting 
back Fourth Amendment restrictions on searching persons and their belongings 
for illegal drugs. Most significant of these may be the decision issued last 
month permitting broad-scale drug-testing of certain U.S. Customs Service 
employees. In the short run, this position marks another invasion of privacy 
legitimated by the "war on drugs." The long-term impact may prove surprising, 
however. It might make the Fourth Amendment popular again. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-18th Century, American merchants howled when English officials 
claimed the authority to search homes and businesses without showing a judge 
that they had good reason for the search. Their outrage became a rallying cry 
for the Revolution and later inspired the Fourth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Today, those who decry unreasonable searches and seizures are not prominent 
merchants. Usually, they are drug dealers. The Burger and Rehnquist courts have 
treated Fourth Amendment claims accordingly, finding ways to cut back the 
amendment's reach and enforcement. Despite the complaints of civil 
libertarians, no one seems to mind much. Most people are not drug dealers, 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, broad-scale drug-testing will affect many law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In late March the court issued two drug-testing opinions. In the most 
far-reaching and controversial of the two, the court held that the government 
could require all Customs employees who apply for promotion, either to a 
position involved in the "war on drugs" or one that involves carrying a 
firearm, to take a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that the government could require such employees to take a drug 
test even if the government has no suspicion that the employee used drugs. And 
the testing would not require a warrant or other judicial authorization. 
</P>
<P>
The main importance of this decision, like many by the court, will be symbolic. 
Although the Customs Service could show no direct link between drug usage and 
corruption or malfeasance by its employees, and although only five employees 
had tested positive out of 3,600 examined, both the government and the court 
majority thought the interests in favor of testing were "compelling." 
</P>
<P>
What was compelling was the symbolism. Those in government connected with the 
"war on drugs" would serve as drug-free examples to the rest of the nation. If 
these government employees could remain drug-free, so might the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling applies only to certain customs employees, but it has broader 
ramifications. Its precedent will legitimate broad-scale drug-testing in many 
governmental contexts. 
</P>
<P>
It also may have an indirect impact on legal challenges to the many 
drug-testing schemes set up by private employers and institutions. Although 
these challenges will not depend on the Constitution because they are not 
government-mandated, the court's treatment of the Fourth Amendment sets an 
example of legal leniency. If forced testing does not violate the fundamental 
law of the land, then perhaps lesser laws will not be violated either. 
</P>
<P>
If mandatory drug-testing becomes more common, it will also become a more 
public, and less judicial, issue. And here it is ordinary middle-class 
Americans who face a major privacy invasion. 
</P>
<P>
How would you feel if your employer required drug-testing? You would receive 
notice of the testing requirement and make an appointment. At the appointed 
time and place, after producing a photo ID, removing outer garments such as a 
coat or jacket, and handing over belongings, you would be given the sample 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Then, you would have the option of urinating behind a partition or in a 
bathroom stall. A monitor of the same sex would stand nearby to verify the 
"normal sounds of urination." After receiving the sample, the monitor would 
check it for normal color and temperature. Then it would go to a lab for 
analysis. This is the procedure followed in the Customs case. 
</P>
<P>
Whether drug-users or not, employees subject to such testing will feel the 
threat of public consequences for private, consensual conduct, as well as the 
threat of false positive test results. This is Big Brother in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse has had devastating consequences in modern America. Politicians urge 
us to declare war on drugs and to free government from legal restraints more 
appropriate to peacetime. In its decision on the Customs Service drug-testing 
program, the Supreme Court has enlisted in the war. 
</P>
<P>
The only virtue of the decision is that it may reawaken the public to the 
privacy protections of the Constitution. Americans may reconsider the nature of 
their war when they discover that its battle cry is the sound of forced 
urination.

WHY THE DOCTOR MAY FALL ASLEEP ON YOUR CASE

research for the division of chest, critical care and sleep medicine at Scripps

Catastrophic consequences can and will occur when we schedule work without heed 
to biological requirements for sleep. The list of human-error accidents 
continues to grow -- committed by people who can't stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board has ruled that the Conrail collision 
in Thompsontown, Pa., in January, 1988, which caused four deaths and $6 million 
in damages, was due to the "sleep-deprived condition of the engineer and other 
crew members." The nuclear disasters at Chernobyl at 1:23 a.m. and Three Mile 
Island at 4 a.m. are two of the most dire incidents occurring at times 
coinciding with the early morning hours when human-error accidents are most 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations of the last two stealth fighter crashes revealed that the pilots 
were overworked. In addition, the pilots did not attempt to eject or otherwise 
avoid a crash and the planes showed no signs of mechanical failure. These are 
the classic indications of fatigue-related accidents. Since the grounding of 
the Exxon Valdez tanker and subsequent oil spill into Prince William Sound took 
place at 12:04 a.m., crew fatigue may have played some role in that tragedy 
also. People fall asleep according to biological laws and have been doing so 
since prehistoric times -- often while at work. When people try to work without 
adequate sleep, dangerous impairment occurs. What is worrisome is that so many 
more people can be hurt when a train driver or a nuclear power engineer falls 
asleep in 1989, than when, say, a stagecoach driver fell asleep in 1889. The 
chances of someone sleeping on the job during round-the-clock operations have 
not changed. Rather, it is the costs in life, property and our global 
environment that have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The public is unaware that errors related to fatigue frequently occur in the 
practice of medicine. Residents work 36- to 60-hour continuous shifts and are 
on duty for 90 to 130 hours per week. Often, because they have not slept, they 
are in a dulled mental state. Yet they perform surgery and treat patients. 
Think of it -- an auto crash victim may undergo brain surgery by a resident who 
has not slept for the last 60 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Attention focused on these issues in 1984 when Libby Zion, a 19-year-old 
college freshman, died unnecessarily. A grand jury found that her death at a 
New York hospital was due to an undiagnosed but treatable infection missed 
because of inadequate medical supervision and resident fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Chances of physician error have greatly increased because technological 
advances now allow critically ill patients to survive longer. But they require 
more complex clinical judgments. One typical case, unfortunately, occurred two 
years ago when a middle-aged Nevada man was rendered unconscious by potassium 
given by rapid, rather than slow, injection. The proper drug and dose had been 
given, but at an incorrect rate. This happened because the on-call resident was 
awakened briefly from a sound sleep and gave an incorrect order that to this 
day he cannot recall. 
</P>
<P>
Surgical residents have literally fallen asleep onto their patients, a problem 
commonly discussed among residents. In a study conducted by the California 
Board of Medical Quality Assurance, fully 75% of residents queried reported 
knowledge of negative impacts on patient care due to long hours on duty. At 
best, tired physicians lack the energy for thorough and compassionate care; at 
worst, they commit serious errors while impaired by sleep deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
Present physician work hours reflect economic considerations: Residents are the 
cheapest source of physician labor. However, rational and biologically sound 
limits to residents' work hours have already been legislated in New York, as 
well as in Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Ireland. Last year, 
similar legislation was introduced in California but killed, in part by 
pressure from organized medicine. Reasonable limits would be a maximum shift 
length of 24 hours and a maximum overnight duty of once every third night. Work 
weeks should average no more than 72 hours in seven days, allowing sufficient 
daily flexibility for medically sound and compassionate transfers of care. 
</P>
<P>
Since organized medicine has not provided adequate regulations on residents' 
working hours, we must look for legislative solutions. The long list of 
catastrophes wrought by sleep-deprived workers in medicine, transportation and 
other industries demands that we find safe and economical solutions to the 
scheduling and risk management problems created by modern, round-the-clock 
operations. The scientific foundation and expertise are now available. But we 
must have active leadership from labor, management and government. Will it take 
another catastrophe to get going?

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: CAUGHT IN THE SPELL OF THE PREDATOR'S EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the underwater distance, I saw the shark's glistening tail fall toward the 
ocean floor. Then its silvery head. The 8-foot fish was being wildly devoured 
by orca whales. I had never seen orcas in clear water before, certainly never 
at the Equator, and certainly never in the frenzy of the hunt. But here were 
the so-called "killer whales" cruising just above me in the tropical seas of 
Wuvulu, New Guinea, a day after we had first spotted them. 
</P>
<P>
Orcas are the masters of the ocean. Weighing up to nine tons, they can swim 
faster than 30 m.p.h. With sharp teeth and clenching jaws, they are the ocean's 
greatest predator. Unlike larger whales, orcas band together like wolves to 
hunt. Thus, although they are not the largest marine mammals, orcas can prey on 
anything, including giant blue whales. 
</P>
<P>
To some, orcas epitomize savagery in the sea. But they are beautiful and 
graceful animals, sharply black and white, and excitement swept over us when we 
first saw the male and female the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, we had no diving gear with us. So we could only weave gently over 
the orcas in the Zodiac, our motorized inflatable boat. I intended to follow 
the male, but he made the first move, slipping under the small craft, slowing 
down as he approached, swimming on his side, fixing his left eye on my startled 
face. Then he took a fresh breath of air and quickly disappeared. I stood for 
several moments in the orange twilight, pondering the memory of his probing 
stare. 
</P>
<P>
I thought our encounter was over. But the next day, amazingly, we saw the orcas 
again. Exuberant with the luck of a second chance, we maneuvered into position 
and dove. The orcas, animals that could bite a diver in half, did not avoid us. 
Neither did they approach -- at least not then. They swam, always 
counterclockwise around the island, in and out from the reef, hunting. 
</P>
<P>
I saw the male ahead of me, crossing from my right to left. He seemed to have a 
torn, flapping upper lip, but he slipped away before I could get a good look. I 
waited. He returned, again swimming from my right to left, this time much 
closer. I could now see that he held a flailing 6-foot manta ray in his jaws, 
the little pilot fish still swimming with the ray. 
</P>
<P>
My frustration boiled. It was a drizzly morning, and the dismal weather was bad 
for filming this astonishing sight. But we had to keep trying. As far as I 
knew, no one ever before had swum with orcas as they chased their prey. 
</P>
<P>
Male and female tore at the ray, ripping it apart. Then the male dove down 
about 40 meters, turning on his side to grab the last sinking morsel, jostling 
it like a cat with a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
By then it was midday, but we stayed in the water. The orcas sailed slowly 
around us in a circle. They seemed in repose, as if taking siesta, yet 
perfectly aware of our presence. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, I swam under the male, a fluke of its tail right above my head. 
Many times I wanted to touch it, but never did. Every time I wanted to reach 
out, something told me not to. Was it reluctance to wake or rouse an animal I 
thought was resting? Was it fear? Respect? I do not know. 
</P>
<P>
The lull lasted about 1 1/2 hours, until the animals suddenly came to life 
again, very agitated. 
</P>
<P>
Like a bullet, the female disappeared, returning with a huge live shark clamped 
in her mouth. I was mesmerized -- the No. 1 predator feeding on No. 2. The 
female seemed to detour, still holding the shark, gliding right in front of us 
as if to flaunt her prize. 
</P>
<P>
By 5 in the afternoon, we had traveled with the orcas as they hunted for about 
24 miles -- more than 1 1/2 times around the island. I felt both exhilarated 
and humbled by the privilege the orcas had bestowed on us. 
</P>
<P>
They could have killed us at any time, yet they did not even try. Though we 
were the most accessible prey, they never turned their power against us. I 
don't know why. I know only that something inexplicable took place that day, as 
deep to me as the gaze of the orca's eye.

ZAN THOMPSON: SEASON BLOSSOMS IN THE HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring has tossed in her petals in the Linda Vista Hills like a no-tomorrow 
gambler. 
</P>
<P>
Even my crotchety hill has never looked so handsome. The roses are as big as 
lettuces, and even Mandy's cymbidiums are theatrically ruffled. We inherited 
the cymbidiums six years ago, along with Mrs. Goldfarb the cat, because Mandy, 
Patsy's daughter, and her husband were off to Japan on a tour of duty. Mandy 
didn't think either the plants or the old lady cat would live through the 
requisite quarantine, so they became our foster charges. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't wanted to tell you but with everything in exuberant bloom, I feel you 
are strong enough to hear that dear Mrs. Goldfarb with the green grape eyes, 
has nipped off quickly and painlessly with a heart attack. No one knew how old 
she was because she adopted Mandy 17 years before she died and she was a young 
lady cat then. Patsy and I were consoled because we had managed to give the old 
lady six years of pampering and quiet. When she lived with Mandy's family, she 
contended with four kids and three Samoyeds. At our house, all she had to put 
up with was an occasionally tidy kiss from Peaches. 
</P>
<P>
The cymbidiums were not as adjustable. They hunkered down in their pot and 
didn't do anything for four years. One day, our esteemed and treasured friend, 
Dr. Arvid Underman, was at the house and looked sadly at the pouting flowers. 
He kindly took them home to his greenhouse where he raises exotic blooms of 
great beauty and ministers to malcontents belonging to other people. He 
separated Mandy's cymbidiums, which were living in woefully overcrowded, 
substandard conditions, and placed them in three different pots. This year, for 
the first time in their lives, they are flinging forth great garlands of 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The irises I planted on the driveway hill are vying to see which one can 
produce the most ruffled blooms. I love them all but the lemon yellow with the 
bright orange center and the chocolate brown are probably my favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Even the azaleas are blooming. (I know other people have great mounds of 
azaleas every year but I never have.) And the kolenchoe, the breath of spring 
and the amaryllis are loaded with blossom. 
</P>
<P>
I know this isn't a patch on what other people have every year but for me, who 
has growing trouble with everything except one giant, aboriginal known to us as 
the geranium that ate Pasadena, it's a veritable fairyland of bloom. 
</P>
<P>
I carefully pulled up the tulip bulbs a week or so ago when they stopped 
blooming. Tulips are gorgeous but they are niggardly with their flowers. One 
flower to a stalk and that's it. I have always been told to refrigerate the 
bulbs so the dumb things will think they are slumbering in the dark cool of the 
forest and be ready to be put in the ground in the fall, where they will bloom 
in the early spring. I have never been able to make that work. 
</P>
<P>
Someone -- Doug, Tim, Patsy or maybe old Green Thumb herself -- has always 
thrown them out during the winter months, thinking they were long-tailed onions 
or just because of boredom with looking at them. Last winter, Patsy threw them 
in a stew by mistake, and although I am not suggesting this is a gourmet 
fillip, we didn't know the difference. Recently, I read an article by a tulip 
specialist who said to toss the bulbs out and start all over again in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
I am sorry to say that I have nothing for a garden encore. When these pretty 
things are finished, it's back to geraniums and roses for the rest of the year. 
Actually, that's not too bad. The rose bushes get to be big, hulking brutes 
with thorns like Malay daggers and have blooms until they are pruned in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Happy springtime, everybody, and I think I'll just go ahead and throw out the 
tulip bulbs right now.

AUTO CLUB MEMBERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only reason I cling to my Auto Club membership of 22 years is my heretofore 
held belief that my wife and daughter are safer if they call the club for 
assistance in the event of a breakdown in some remote threatening place. 
</P>
<P>
The one time they needed such help, roadside phone operators put my daughter on 
hold and rerouted her call several times for unexplained reasons. There had 
been stories in the press and on TV of women assaulted or worse when they left 
their cars to use the phone system so the hassle of getting the attention of 
the dispatchers caused her considerable concern. Then there was a wait of 40 
minutes in the car on a dark freeway before the tow truck arrived. Meanwhile 
cars occupied by men slowed or stopped alongside. 
</P>
<P>
Now we learn of one woman's more dreadful experience of kidnap and rape because 
the club dispatcher insisted she stay at the phone until the tow truck arrived 
("Angry Mother Leads Campaign Against Auto Club Rules" by Dianne Klein, March 
27). 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me, if the club is, as it claims, an organization of individuals 
joined in company for mutual protection and benefit, it would adopt a less 
cavalier attitude towards us, its members. Rather than relying on the premise 
that someone in danger and fearing for her safety should draw on some 
extraordinary reserve of calm and common sense to look after herself as the 
club apologists propose, let them now revise their operating procedure for such 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Better, get the so-called automobile members organizations out of the loop. The 
emergency phone system should be redesigned to give highest priority to 
alerting a law enforcement agency as to the plight of a helpless woman. Adopt 
the attitude assumed by amateur radio operators when they come upon a motorist, 
female or male, stranded on the freeways: Call the CHP. Let professionals sort 
out the situation.

MIRRORING A MALADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Pittas' comments are right on target, especially his criticism of 
architects designing primarily for recognition by colleagues, often at he 
expense of the community and the intended user ("American Dream House: New 
Reality," by Connie Koenenn, March 21). His revelation of the profession's 
non-existence in the arena of code development, though assuredly shocking to 
laymen, is true. 
</P>
<P>
We architects, individually and collectively, have castigated ourselves 
mercilessly for decades over this predicament. 
</P>
<P>
However, let's remember that all of the great architecture of the past was 
instigated by non-architects, primarily secular and ecclesiastical nobility 
that generously supported this delicate profession, so it always rose to 
excellence. These people were the driving force of the entire marvelous culture 
we in America inherited from the Old World of Europe and other civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, today, behind the steering wheel are uncultured opportunists at 
every level, whose obsessive on-a-roll-and-can't-be-stopped philaguria (Greek 
for "love of money") has created a self-destructive "ledger book" culture of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
Architects, by the very nature of their calling, can only mirror this malady. 
Their current mutual admiration society, cowering in the face of their greatest 
historical challenge, is a direct reaction to the absence of support by the 
people in power.

INTERCULTURAL ETIQUETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thoroughly enjoyed "Intercultural Etiquette." I especially wish to praise 
Jacquelyn Mitchell for creating the course for her Afro-American studies 
program at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I do object to the implication that cultural borrowing is 
essentially insensitive to the natives. For one thing, if I hadn't seen the 
movie "10," I would have not been aware of the unique African-style braids. It 
has never occurred to me that the producers or Bo Derek were being racist or 
poking fun at another culture.

Three marks for poor taste in the photographs selected to accompany Itabari 
Njeri's well-written article. Showing a modicum of sensibility with selection 
of a beautiful woman of Indian descent, the subsequent photographic panels were 
quite offensive, including the English dandy. 
</P>
<P>
You could not find one photograph in your archives of an African-American 
female with braided hair? Or must Bo Derek continue to represent the ASP (Anglo 
Saxon Protestant -- the W is redundant) view of the appropriate image of 
African hair styling. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-American females too must be wondering why they are caricatured in 1989 
with a photograph of a female wearing heavy pancake makeup with a Betty Boop 
coiffure, vintage 1940.

HOT PROPERTY: SITTING HIGH AND DRY ABOVE SUNSET BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've ever driven along Pacific Coast Highway through Seal Beach, you've 
probably seen one of the most unusual houses in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It's a landmark there, and as realtor Stephanie St. Pierre of Century 21 in 
Huntington Beach likes to say, "It's up for grabs, but it's quite a reach." 
</P>
<P>
The house is for sale at $3.5 million, but St. Pierre, who has the listing, was 
talking about its location: The house is perched 85 feet above the ground atop 
wooden stilts that once were part of the SUNSET BEACH WATER TOWER. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like a redwood water tank on the outside and a playboy's penthouse 
inside, and it's owned by Bob Odell, an anesthesiologist, and George Armstrong, 
a math professor. They are selling because Odell moved his practice, St. Pierre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men bought the abandoned 1940-era tower in 1980, then built the 
three-level house at ground level while the tower was restored. The house was 
lifted by crane to the top of the tower in 1984, they same year they moved in. 
</P>
<P>
Now it has such features as a marble-floored commercial elevator with piped-in 
music to the first floor, several wet bars, a spa, stained-glass cupola with 
fire-pit table that retracts to reveal a dance floor and two master bedroom 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
TAMARA BANE, of the Tamara Bane Gallery on Melrose Avenue, and her husband, 
Robert, not only "surround themselves with beautiful art," realtor Jana Jones 
says, "they also surround themselves with beautiful actresses." 
</P>
<P>
Jones just sold the couple a new house in the Hollywood Hills, not far from 
their gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Ladd, Vanna White and Cheryl Tiegs all live within a couple blocks of 
the house, which was purchased for close to its $2.9-million asking price, 
though the home hasn't been completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's worried because the Banes bought this half-done house, but it will 
be finished to the nth degree," said Jones, who had the listing with Alvarez, 
Hyland &amp; Young in Beverly Hills. "Mr. Bane plans to complete it with the 
help of (architect) Gus Duffy in an Italian-Mediterranean style so it looks 
like a walled estate." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy also did original plans for the 6,200-square-foot home, which has what 
Jones describes as "a city view all the way to the ocean" and views from every 
room, including the master bath. The Banes will move from a house they own in 
Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
TERRY MURPHY, former KCBS-TV Channel 2 anchor, and her Morocco-born husband, 
fashion designer David Timsit (president of Shanghai, a menswear firm), have 
purchased what Ruth Hoffman, of Mike Silverman &amp; Associates, says is "a 
large hacienda with a lot of character." 
</P>
<P>
It has about 12,000 square feet of interior space, with seven bedrooms and 10 
baths, and it's in the flats of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It was built in the 1950s but is in super shape though the couple plans to do 
some remodeling, said Hoffman, who represented them in the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy just had a baby boy and is not back yet to a news job. In a staff 
shake-up, she and John Schubeck, both longtime anchors, were fired from Channel 
2 last December. 
</P>
<P>
Producer TED FIELD, of the Marshall Field family, isn't the only Southern 
Californian who owns a second home in Aspen, Colo., said realtor Bob Ritchie of 
Coates Reid &amp; Waldron in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
But buyers now are finding that the average sales price is slightly more than 
$1 million. When Field bought there last year, the average was $930,000. 
</P>
<P>
The average sales price was jacked up by Field's purchase, Ritchie said. "I 
sold that house for (Hawaiian hotel developer) Chris Hemmeter at $16.3 
million." The least expensive lot in any Aspen neighborhood is now $500,000, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
And talk about a hot market: He listed a lot a few weeks ago at $2 million, and 
it sold seven days later for $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
As for other big-name Californians owning Aspen property, he said, "Jack 
Nicholson has two houses here -- an 11,000-square-foot guest house and a little 
home for himself. . . . He takes care of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"And Jim Stout has a very nice house here." James D. Stout, a one-time Irvine 
real estate developer acquitted of charges of kickbacks in deals involving 
Beverly Hills Savings &amp; Loan, was last reported living in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. publicist Lee Solters added, "People here are talking about the retailing 
tycoon Leslie Wexner and his fantabulous house in Aspen." 
</P>
<P>
It has a pool and hot tub in the master bedroom, Solters said, and a pigskin 
floor and leather drapes in another room. 
</P>
<P>
Wexner is chief executive officer and chairman of The Limited, a nationwide 
clothing chain and parent company of The Express, another clothing chain, and 
the small New York City specialty store Henri Bendel.

CABBAGE PATCH TO 'URBAN VILLAGE'; 
</P>
<P>
$700-MILLION MACARTHUR PLACE ON FORMER SANTA ANA FARM TO INCLUDE OFFICE, 
RETAIL, RESIDENTIAL USES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When developer Roger Torriero wanted to buy a 66-acre parcel in Santa Ana, he 
opened negotiations with Roy Sakioka, patriarch of the family that owned much 
of the land, with a fine piece of sashimi. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the story goes, Sakioka, a 90-year-old farmer who immigrated from 
Japan in 1913, agreed to sell his 53 acres of cabbage and cucumber fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, that didn't seal the deal," said George Sakioka, the patriarch's 
grandson, referring to the sashimi. "We appreciated the offering of the fine 
albacore . . . but the way we do business, a deal has to make economic sense." 
</P>
<P>
The Sakiokas, who own more than $200 million worth of undeveloped land and hold 
ground leases on high-rise office and housing projects, got $41 million in cash 
and a 27% interest in their Santa Ana fields plus a 27% interest in an adjacent 
13 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-acre site is now being developed into one of the largest mixed-use 
projects in Orange County. Grading and site work will begin this week, with 
completion estimated in 10 to 15 years at a cost of $700 million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Known as MacArthur Place, and located on the northeastern corner of MacArthur 
Boulevard and Main Street, the project was master-planned by M. Paul Friedberg 
&amp; Partners of New York to encompass 4.5 million square feet of office, 
hotel, retail, dining, entertainment and residential space. 
</P>
<P>
BGS Partners is owner/developer of the 66 acres. BCE Development Inc. (BCED), 
affiliated with Bell Canada Enterprises, is the managing general partner. 
</P>
<P>
BCED will develop the first office building -- an 11-story, $50-million 
structure, designed by Gensler &amp; Associates/Architects and built by the 
Austin Co. -- starting in August, simultaneously with the housing. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur Place also will have 400 condominium units to be rented as 
apartments. Torriero is a principal in Griffin/Related Properties, which plans 
to develop the housing. Griffin and the Sakiokas are limited partners in BGS. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the housing, Griffin executive Matthew Witte said, "This part of 
the project will be unique for Orange County, because the housing will be built 
on top of 150,000 square feet of retail space." 
</P>
<P>
The condos will be above ground-level stores in several mid-rise buildings on 
11 acres, with parks on one side and office buildings on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The developers are calling MacArthur Place "an urban village," but that 
primarily applies to the housing part, Witte said, "because it is the only 
place in the whole project where there will be housing and retail." 
</P>
<P>
The vice president of office centers for BCED, Murray Hay, said, "When we think 
about it as an urban village, we see a mix of uses, with people living and 
working in the area instead of feeding into traffic patterns." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was an issue that barred other developments, including a 20,500-seat 
sports arena called Westdome, from the site, but traffic remains an issue 
despite unanimous City Council approval of MacArthur Place. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Merritt, a resident who describes himself as "the ramrod behind the 
(1986) protests against Westdome," said, "Roger (Torriero) is a good 
psychologist. He won us over by having those meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Those meetings were held by Torriero on a regular basis after he became 
interested in the site and enlisted BCED's participation. Torriero formed what 
became known as the Stakeholders Council, composed of residents with a stake in 
the neighborhood. The meetings were held to keep the residents up to date on 
the development and answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Uehli, project manager with the city's Community Development Agency, said 
Torriero convinced the residents that his was a different type of development, 
"so he overrode any objections." The project sailed through the approval 
processes with no public dissent, Uehli noted. 
</P>
<P>
Merritt said he and other residents disapproved of earlier attempts by other 
developers to build a sports arena on the site. "But traffic was the big 
factor, and it will still be unbelievable," he said. "The city has given us a 
lot of ideas about how traffic will be improved, but I doubt that I will see 
any solutions in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is already congested in the area, he added, and it will only grow worse 
with the 15,000 jobs expected to be created with MacArthur Place. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic also concerns Helen Brown, executive director of Civic Center Barrio, a 
Santa Ana group born in the 1970s to develop housing for barrio residents 
displaced by redevelopment. MacArthur Place is in a redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticizes Project 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most ill-planned project I ever saw. The 55 Freeway dumps into 
MacArthur Boulevard. Hutton Place, with its office towers, dumps into 
MacArthur. So do the industrial buildings and condominiums already there. And 
now they have the nerve to go in there and put in 400 new housing units? We'll 
spend 45 minutes to go one mile." 
</P>
<P>
She is less critical of the traffic than the housing, however. She said none of 
it will be set aside for low- and moderate-income residents, though Santa Ana 
suffers from a severe shortage of low-income rental housing. The monthly 
rentals will range from about $600 to $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Sims of the Legal Aid Foundation in Santa Ana said, "There is concern 
with a lot of housing advocates that the city is not spending what it should on 
low-income housing." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, 20% of the housing in a redevelopment area is reserved for people 
with low incomes, but Uehli said: 
</P>
<P>
"As MacArthur Place develops, it will generate a tax increment, and 20% will be 
set aside for low-income housing. So they (the developers) are not bound to 
develop it on their site. The tax increment will benefit low-income housing 
citywide." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David N. Ream said, "First-time ownership is something we're 
trying to promote in various other projects in the city, but the (MacArthur 
Place) apartments will provide a much needed amenity in the southeastern part 
of the city."

Let's tell Paul Stewart of Long Beach (Letters, March 26) that the reason 
gardening is on the front page of the Real Estate Sections is that it is an 
integral part of a construction plan, real estate venture or for the homeowner 
prepping his property for beauty or for sale! It's all enhancement when one 
reads (Robert) Smaus.

I am so impressed with your newly revised Real Estate Section that I decided to 
write and say "thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Especially to be noted are sections on preservation, urban scene, architects, 
gardening and home improvements. Leon Whiteson's article on the Home Savings of 
America Tower (March 19) was well written and most interesting.

SPANISH COLONIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My parents were in Los Angeles recently and sent me a copy of Leon Whiteson's 
article (" '20s Spanish Style Needs No Revival," March 5). 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, we moved into a Spanish Colonial home in Omaha. Spanish 
Colonial exists, but is not a common style here. 
</P>
<P>
Our home was designed in 1925 by an Omaha architect and has all of the 
characteristics you mentioned except the white stucco. I think all of the 
Spanish Colonial homes we have seen in Omaha are of a dark beige stucco. 
However, we are interested in learning more about this style of architecture 
and, after reading your article, are considering re-stuccoing the house white.

POLICE ACADEMY II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department says it has no plans to take any more land 
from Elysian Park for its proposed Police Academy expansion. That may or may 
not be. The Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park has seen a breakdown of 
planned building square footage (224,000 square feet) but, to date, LAPD has 
failed to show us how the buildings will fit on the site it currently occupies. 
We have seen plans that include three parking structures of two and three 
stories, not underground as Capt. Gregory R. Berg states (Letters, April 2), to 
accommodate 1,000 cars. Nowhere in any of the plans is there any mention of 
enclosed firing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Berg's claim that the issue of moving the Academy out of the park was 
"extensively debated" in 1972 is misleading. In 1972, the city administrative 
officer submitted a report to the City Council that studied complete cost 
estimates of alternative sites for a new Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 29 sites considered, six were judged to have good potential. Two would 
have required no land acquisition cost. A third site of 60 acres (Ascot 
Reservoir) was both centrally located and would have cost only $600,000. The 
LAPD, however, did not wish to consider any of these alternatives. There was no 
debate. There were no public hearings. What ensued was a debate among City 
Council members whether or not to place Charter Amendment U on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Although a majority of then-council members had long sought to oust the police 
department from Elysian Park land, the council, under intense pressure from 
LAPD, agreed 8 to 7 to place the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. This 
proposed to transfer jurisdiction of 21.46 acres of Elysian Park from the 
Department of Recreation and Parks to the Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD stated that a "yes" vote would save taxpayers $15 million that it would 
cost to relocate the Academy. Where that figure came from, we don't know. The 
point to be made is that LAPD successfully used tax threats to gain a narrow 
margin for the passage of Proposition U, and in November, 1972, 21 acres of 
parkland was lost. Capt. Berg is obviously unaware of this history or he would 
not have "seriously doubted" that voters would allow any land to be taken away 
from the park in the future. 
</P>
<P>
A Police Academy does not belong in a park. The training exercises and pistol 
firing are not compatible with park enjoyment. The traffic the officers and 
recruits generate add air and noise pollution. To increase the training 
capacity threefold is what LAPD has in mind. To think that this would not 
negatively impact the surrounding park is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
We do not argue that LAPD needs better facilities to train our officers, but 
please, not in Elysian Park.

Beyond the speeches, the symposiums, the awards, the networking and the

As such, it is a time for interior and industrial designers, architects and

style-conscious industry. 
</P>

Eventually, much of what was unveiled in the "to-the-trade-only" showrooms of 
the Pacfic Design Center in West Hollywood during Westweek will find itself 
into the more tony stores everywhere over the next year.

LAURA SCUDDER WAS MORE THAN A NAME; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY PARK WILL HONOR 'PIONEER, INSTIGATOR, DOER' WHO HELPED CREATE 
SNACK-FOOD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When she died 30 years ago, the newspapers called her the Potato Chip Queen of 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the decades have passed, Laura Scudder has faded from public memory, to 
the point where there is little to suggest that she existed, beyond being a 
name on a potato chip bag or a peanut butter jar. 
</P>
<P>
So now, in a suburban city whose historical roots don't go much deeper than the 
trees planted in the first housing tracts developed there after World War I, 
Monterey Park is laying claim to its local hero. 
</P>
<P>
The life and times of Laura C. Scudder will be the focus of an afternoon 
celebration at the city's Garvey Ranch Park historical museum on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a woman in business, ahead of her time," said Louis Davis, Monterey 
Park's city treasurer and president of its historical society. "I can just 
imagine what she had to go through." 
</P>
<P>
Working from a dusty two-acre parcel that she and her husband bought in 1920, 
Scudder parlayed a home-grown potato chip business into a multimillion-dollar 
food empire that spanned California, Nevada, Arizona and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
She started the business in 1926, at the suggestion of a friend, in a brick 
building she and her husband had built next to their home and a gas station 
they ran. They had previously rented the building to a barber who, in those 
Prohibition days, turned out to be a bootlegger. 
</P>
<P>
Scudder, a Republican and an Episcopalian, kicked out the bootlegger. Without 
the rent income, she had another motivation to make and sell potato chips: to 
support her family. She had four children, and her husband's health had failed 
since a car fell on him at the station. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a pioneer, an instigator, a doer. . . ." says a pamphlet written by 
Joseph R. Blackstock, a former president of the Monterey Park Historical 
Society. "She also helped create the potato chip-snack food industry." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being strong-willed, Scudder was a big, good-looking woman whose 
trademark was wearing wide, flat-brimmed hats. Advertisements showed 
photographs of her in hat and gloves, a purse under her arm. Her signature 
followed ad copy that often included recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Blackstock, who is director of market research for Patrick Media in Los 
Angeles, once helped Scudder with billboard advertising. He says: "In 1926 
there were almost no women in America starting food businesses, although food 
is considered women's business. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today, if we went out to find a woman running her own food business -- I 
mean a big one, and as the chief executive officer -- where would (she) be?" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, several factors have prompted the Monterey Park Historical Society 
to honor Scudder. Eighteen months ago, John Scudder of Hermosa Beach decided to 
make a film about his grandmother. After extensive research funded by money he 
inherited from her, Scudder completed a 53-minute color video entitled "Laura." 
It will be featured in the April 23 celebration of Laura Scudder Day. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Scudder family last year gave $15,000 to the historical society to 
fund scholarships for graduates of Alhambra High School, which Laura Scudder's 
children attended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Preserve Story 
</P>
<P>
John Scudder, a studio photographer by trade, previously made a video about 
humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. He said he began the "Laura" project "to 
preserve the story before it blew away." Mostly, he wanted to make a film for 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
Scudder, who was 12 when his grandmother died, said: "I thought I knew her 
story pretty well. But I really didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The more he researched, the more Scudder realized that it was a story with much 
wider appeal. "It's a motivational story," he said, "about hard times, and 
inspiring to both men and women." 
</P>
<P>
He contacted Blackstock, who more than a decade earlier had conducted his own 
lengthy research. 
</P>
<P>
Blackstock, who got the idea in 1971, said: "A 350-page book had just come out 
about Sirhan Sirhan, the murderer of Robert Kennedy. I thought, 'Here you got a 
great big volume about a murderer and not a word about Mrs. Scudder.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visited Plant 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in the San Gabriel Valley, Blackstock went with school 
friends to visit the Scudder operation on the northeast corner of Garvey Avenue 
and Atlantic Boulevard. For decades, he said, it was the only large business in 
Monterey Park. The firm moved to Anaheim in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Scudder and her family sold the business in 1957. Since then, it has 
changed hands three other times. The latest transaction occurred in 1987, when 
the business -- which has expanded far beyond its original product line of 
potato chips, peanut butter, mayonnaise and toasted nuts -- was sold for $100 
million to Borden Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Both Blackstock and John Scudder discovered that Laura was much more than the 
founder of a potato chip company. Although she closely guarded her privacy, her 
grandson said, "she had a lot of heart and a lot of love, and she was real 
tough businesswoman, too. It was a great combination." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Philadelphia in 1881, she was the only child of parents of modest 
means. Her mother died when Laura was 2. Relations were strained between Laura 
and her father, a baker and butcher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Married Patient 
</P>
<P>
She went to nursing school because she couldn't afford to go to medical school. 
Eventually she married one of her patients, Charles Scudder, a farmer and 
inventor. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Blackstock said, they lived with Charles' relatives on the Scudder 
family farm, where earlier Scudders had welcomed George Washington and his 
troops the night they made their famous crossing of the Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
But Laura apparently grew tired of this setting. With her trunk packed, she 
told her husband one day in 1910: "I'm going West." He decided to go with her. 
</P>
<P>
First in Seattle and later in the Northern California community of Ukiah, they 
struggled to create a life that would take them beyond the days when they ate 
mush meal for Christmas and when, Laura once wrote, "We didn't have a nickel 
even to buy a little doll" as a Christmas gift for their children. 
</P>
<P>
In Ukiah, she and her husband ran the Little Davenport restaurant. Lawyers at 
the courthouse across the street hailed her as a great cook. She asked them how 
she could become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Reading from borrowed books, she learned enough to take the bar exam. She 
traveled by train to Sacramento while four months' pregnant and easily passed, 
becoming the first woman lawyer in Ukiah's history. Although she never 
practiced law, she used her legal skills in her business. 
</P>
<P>
"Laura could do anything," said Blackstock, who spent three years interviewing 
hundreds of people around the nation for his pamphlet. "She lacked what most 
humans have: those gremlins that say, 'I can't do it.' I just regret there are 
no statues, no streets named, no schools in her honor in Monterey Park." 
</P>
<P>
Both Blackstock and John Scudder had difficulty doing their research. "She was 
a private person," Blackstock said. "You could be working with her, but that 
doesn't mean you're going to know Laura Scudder." 
</P>
<P>
This privacy was not the result of anything mysterious, John Scudder said. 
"There wasn't anything I found that was embarrassing or any dirty laundry." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, they found people ready to praise Scudder for running a hometown 
family business that employed many of the poorer women of Monterey Park and 
gave work during the Depression to those no one else would help -- the 
housewives. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these women spoke of being grateful to work, even in their homes. They 
fashioned waxed-paper bags for the potato chips, ironing three sides of the 
bags before they were taken back to the plant to be filled and sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Scudder was among the first potato chip companies to use waxed bags to 
ensure freshness, Blackstock said. When chips were sold in markets in the early 
20th Century, they were dispensed from glass cases into paper bags. 
</P>
<P>
As a nurse, Scudder often treated her employees for injuries. Once she heard 
that a worker was crying on the job because her daughter had run away. "Mrs. 
Scudder picked up the phone, hired a private detective and, in a day or two, 
had the kid back," Blackstock said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough on Debtors 
</P>
<P>
Still, she was hard-nosed in business, known for paying her bills the day they 
arrived and being equally tough on those who owed her. In 1928, the year her 
husband, Charles, died, she went ahead with plans to build another plant in 
Oakland. By 1953, when she opened a plant in Fresno, the company had 1,000 
employees and about 50% of the California potato chip market. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure freshness for the dairy products in her mayonnaise, she bought a 
ranch on Workman Mill Road, near today's intersection of the San Gabriel River 
and Pomona freeways, where she raised her own chickens and cows. "It was a 
little unfair to say she did it all," Blackstock said, noting that her children 
and relatives also helped develop the company. "But it was her business, 
period." 
</P>
<P>
After her husband died, she was increasingly aided by his son from a previous 
marriage, also named Charles, who had come to live with the Scudders. After his 
father's death, he and Laura Scudder married when they both were middle-aged. 
"Monterey Park could never get over that," said Blackstock. "Yet they were in 
no way related, really, before they married." 
</P>
<P>
Scudder was strong enough to take any criticism. When she first went into 
business, Blackstock said, she couldn't get any insurance for the firm's one 
delivery truck. Insurance agents told her that she was a woman and couldn't be 
relied upon to stay in business long enough to pay the premium. 
</P>
<P>
So she found a woman insurance agent in Los Angeles who eventually got the 
business of insuring hundreds of Scudder delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
And when the men of Monterey Park wouldn't support a parks bond issue, she said 
at a public meeting that if the men had to stay home and take care of the 
children for a few days, they would see how important parks were. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Eli Isenberg, publisher of the Monterey Park Progress, 
Scudder once said: "I'm a working girl. We're planted on earth to work, and day 
by day I do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg noted: "The essence of this woman is not to be found in the money she 
made."

PIKE PROJECT BRINGS WORRY ABOUT FUTURE TRAFFIC WOES 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As officials eagerly embrace a massive proposal to turn the old Pike Amusement 
Park site into the biggest single development ever built in this city, 
questions are emerging about the dramatic traffic increases that will accompany 
Pike and other planned downtown projects. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about future traffic woes proved the major reservation when the 
Planning Commission recently gave an impressively credentialed development team 
one of several key approvals needed to erect a mini-city by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most heated criticism cast on a development that has attracted 
profuse praise, a member of a citywide citizens' group warned planning 
commissioners last month that they were propelling the city into a traffic 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Problems Unclear 
</P>
<P>
"As things currently stand, the foreseeable impact of traffic over the next 10 
years in the downtown area is gridlock," contended Marc Coleman of Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved. "I firmly believe that when the citizens of Long Beach 
understand the blank check that is being given to the Pike project through the 
lack of effective planning, a widespread outcry will develop." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic officials concede downtown developments are being built before 
the city fully knows what new traffic problems they will breed or how to solve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a good handle on the ultimate consequences of all the 
development that has been approved or is in the approval process," Richard 
Backus, the city traffic engineer, noted. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that their blueprints for turning Long Beach's sleepy 
downtown into a bustling urban center will bring thousands of additional cars 
to local streets, city officials say they are studying ways of coping with the 
traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a problem, there will be a crisis if we don't do something about 
it now," acknowledged Robert Paternoster, the city's planning and building 
director, who said the city is by no means ignoring the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of escalating traffic, the city has hired a consulting firm to 
design a computer model to predict traffic tie-ups associated with new 
development throughout the city and to indicate ways of averting them. City 
planners are also requiring the Pike developers to devise programs encouraging 
car-pooling and use of mass transit by the 8,000 employees eventually expected 
to work in the project's office buildings, shops and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Densest Development 
</P>
<P>
Designed as the densest development in Long Beach, the 13-acre Pike complex of 
mid- and high-rises is characterized by large dimensions. More than 3 million 
square feet of office, residential and commercial space would be constructed in 
11 buildings lining the shore on what is now a largely empty expanse of asphalt 
south of Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be built over a 13-year period, represents 22% of the total 
office space planned for downtown, 19% of the hotel space, 8% of the 
residential space and 16% of the retail space. A quarter of downtown's ultimate 
work force would be employed there. 
</P>
<P>
Three garages would contain nearly 6,000 parking spaces. Drivers traveling to 
and from the Pike complex could make as many as 36,000 car trips a day, 
according to the proposal's environmental impact report, which predicted 
significant increases in auto-related air pollution and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Planning Commission by a 6-1 vote on March 30 approved zoning 
and local coastal plan changes that more than double the site's allowable 
density and increase the maximum building height by nearly 200 feet, to 600 
feet. Only Commissioner Elbert Segelhorst voted against the proposal, 
explaining that he liked the project but could not approve it before traffic 
concerns were dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council and the state Coastal Commission must still review the 
proposal, a venture of the Ratkovich Co. of Los Angeles and Enterprise 
Development West, a subsidiary of a company established by James Rouse, who is 
known for developing Columbia, Md., and popular waterfront complexes in 
Baltimore and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hart, Pike's project manager, said the environmental report's estimate of 
36,000 car trips a day "is truly a worse case analysis . . . and it is a scary 
number." The estimate exaggerates the amount of traffic that will likely be 
generated by the new community, he said, adding that his planners are trying to 
come up with a more realistic figure. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hart said, such a naked statistic ignores the economic and social 
benefits of creating a new urban hub in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
City traffic engineers say a more probable traffic figure for the Pike 
development is 27,500 car trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Pike traffic count, it is only a part of downtown's long-term 
traffic picture. Another 11 developments have been approved or are under way in 
the downtown area, including the World Trade Center, Landmark Square and the 
McDonnell Douglas office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the city's Strategic Plan for the year 2000 predicted that if all the 
development plans for the port, downtown and the airport come to fruition, 
traffic leading to those areas would more than double. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what the solutions are," said Planning Commissioner Patricia 
Schauer, who prefaced her vote for the Pike project with complaints that the 
city should have had a transportation plan in place before moving ahead with 
such a massive development scheme. "I don't even know if there are solutions 
that are economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush-Hour Bottlenecks 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Coleman, of Citizens Involved, said, there are rush-hour bottlenecks 
leading to downtown, such as at the intersection of Ocean Boulevard and 
Alamitos Avenue, "where I can state from personal observation, that many 
mornings, traffic is backed up . . . for eight-tenths of a mile all the way to 
Cherry Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The city's 2000 plan noted several other congested areas in Long Beach, a 
number of them along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Paternoster, who said he has long advocated a traffic study but could not halt 
development until one is in place, said the computer traffic report should be 
completed in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city gets a clearer idea of Long Beach's emerging traffic scenario, 
Backus said, the door is being left open to require developers to adopt traffic 
control measures once the full impact of their projects is gauged. 
</P>
<P>
While the light-rail system under construction between Los Angeles and Long 
Beach will take autos off Long Beach streets, Backus said, it probably will not 
improve the overall traffic situation in the city because the street-level rail 
line will slow the flow of cars. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-congestion measures thus far asked of the Pike developers -- 
subsidized mass transit passes, ride-sharing programs and the like -- are 
"nothing real innovative," Backus acknowledged, but, he said, such practices 
are not yet in widespread use in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will also be required to install traffic signals and add turn 
lanes on some streets adjacent to the project, which will stretch from Pine 
Avenue to Queensway Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Hart mentioned other possibilities as well, such as establishing remote parking 
lots from which downtown employees could be shuttled, and starting some sort of 
a shuttle system along Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Hart dismissed complaints that the city has been too slow to plan for the 
anticipated jumps in traffic volume. But the Pike team several months ago 
joined other developers in launching their own study of how best to transport 
workers and visitors along Ocean Boulevard and across the bay to the Queen 
Mary, near which the Disney Co. is considering developing a major resort hotel. 
The developers have even talked of building a privately financed monorail.

'SPIRIT OF GROWTH' PROMISES A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE LONG BEACH MUSEUM OF ART, 
SAYS NEW DIRECTOR 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold B. Nelson had a smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
He was seated at the folding table temporarily serving as his desk in the bare 
sunlit office. On the table lay a pair of scissors and a catalogue of office 
products. Directly opposite him, a large picture window afforded a breezy view 
of the Pacific Ocean lined with palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this place," said Nelson, a crisp, neatly dressed, balding 41-year-old, 
gazing wistfully out the window. "It's a very diverse community and I find that 
diversity challenging and appealing." 
</P>
<P>
It was Nelson's first day as the new executive director of the Long Beach 
Museum of Art. But already he was framing a vision of the institution's future 
as bright as that of the ocean framed by the window. "There's a spirit of 
growth, newness and exploration," he said. "Back East, it's more the status 
quo. Here there's a feeling of positive energy, enthusiasm, support and a 
desire to grow." 
</P>
<P>
All of which has come not a moment too soon, other museum officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson takes the helm of the 34-year-old museum at a particularly critical 
time. Housed since the 1950s by the sea in a quaint brick building that was 
once the home of a wealthy philanthropist, the institution spent its first 30 
years as a municipal facility financed entirely by the city. In 1985 the museum 
declared its independence, coming under the management of the private, 
nonprofit Long Beach Museum of Art Foundation. At the time, the city agreed to 
continue its support of $357,000 annually at least until 1990, at which time 
the situation will be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Resigned 
</P>
<P>
But the transition has not been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, scores of patrons were angered when museum officials restructured 
the institution's bookstore to make it more profitable and terminated the 
store's popular long-time manager. Later, the museum council's six-member board 
of directors -- a group of volunteers responsible for membership and attendance 
-- resigned en masse to protest the institution's handling of a summer concert 
series. And a much-discussed plan to move the facility to more spacious 
quarters downtown collapsed after it became apparent that neither the city nor 
the museum was in a position to pay for the move. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the tumult was the sudden resignation last August of Nelson's 
predecessor, Stephen Garrett, after four years as director. The former head of 
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Garrett had been criticized, among other 
things, for lacking fortitude to manage by "overt control" rather than by 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Other results can be seen in statistics. From a peak of about 1,200 in early 
1988, museum membership is expected to drop to about 950 by the end of this 
month, in part, according to spokesman Jon Moynes, because of disillusionment 
with management and in part due to what he calls a "cleansing" of the 
membership roster to eliminate those who are no longer paying dues. While 
membership is still about 20% above what it was in 1985, Moynes said, most 
museum officials would like to see it grow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue at a Plateau 
</P>
<P>
And for the past several years, officials say, the museum's annual revenue -- 
including the portion contributed by the city -- has hovered at about $800,000, 
unable to fulfill early predictions that it would quickly break $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a plateau to get over," said Linda McCullough, president of the museum 
foundation's board of directors. "We need to go on to a new level." 
</P>
<P>
When Garrett was hired in 1984, she said, the museum was primarily concerned 
with improving its image, a task that was largely accomplished by the former 
director's association with the Getty museum. In the intervening years, she 
said, "we have established ourselves as a respectable place and I don't think 
we're worried about that anymore. What we need now is more community support." 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials hope that Nelson -- whose annual salary, according to 
McCullough, is about $50,000 -- will help generate that support. 
</P>
<P>
They say that Nelson, as the former chief administrator for exhibitions of the 
American Federation of Arts in New York and the San Francisco-based Art Museum 
Assn. of America, has considerable experience in putting together art shows 
that attract people and in writing grant requests that attract money. As a 
native Easterner, they say, he has a unique perspective on what makes the West 
Coast special. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's wonderful," Moynes said. "He's very personable, he's interested 
in what we do and he will make a serious attempt to play from our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
One of those strengths, according to Nelson, is the city's growing diversity of 
ethnic cultures. To make the museum more relevant to them, he said, he intends 
to mount a greater diversity of exhibitions reflective of those cultures and 
likely to be of interest to blacks, Latinos, Asians and others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committed to Outreach 
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that all museums break down their ivory tower orientation and 
reach out to these new communities," Nelson said. "I am committed to having the 
museum reach out to the sectors of the community it has never reached out to in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nelson said, he plans to increase the institution's visibility 
through greater community involvement, enhance membership through targeted 
mailings and an improved brochure, and build a stronger financial base through 
improved marketing techniques aimed at the local business community. 
</P>
<P>
While a move by the museum to a larger facility is still a possibility, Nelson 
said, he intends to put such plans on a back burner while systematically 
exploring other options such as expanding the present site. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful, wonderful spot we have here," he said. "There's an 
intimacy in the gallery spaces that's unusual in a museum. For the immediate 
future, we should build on what we have and think about the long term in a slow 
and deliberate way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concept of Leadership 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he is a strong team builder who believes in management through 
inspiration. "The staff needs true leadership," he said with characteristic 
self-confidence, "something they haven't had in the past. They need someone to 
promote teamwork, and my style of management is that of a team leader." 
</P>
<P>
During his first day on the job last week, however, the new executive director 
spent a lot of time just soaking up the sunny environment in his office. A 
native of Rhode Island, Nelson, who is single, spent four years in San 
Francisco before returning to New York in 1987. "I missed California 
immediately," said the museum director, who is an avid backpacker and 
bicyclist. 
</P>
<P>
It was from atop a bicycle during a 10-day pedaling trip from San Francisco to 
San Diego, in fact, that he first viewed Long Beach in 1987. "I thought it was 
a beautiful place," Nelson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
And the museum? "Didn't even notice it," the director now admits. "I went 
wheeling right on by."

$1.4-MILLION BUDGET CUT PROPOSED FOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 280 Whittier-area high school students would lose bus service and four 
high schools would go without librarians as part of a $1.4-million budget cut 
proposed by officials of the Whittier Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Lee Eastwood blamed the budget shortfall on a combination of 
circumstances, including declining enrollment and the high cost of medical 
benefits for district employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to keep the cuts directly away from the classroom, although the 
library comes rather close," Eastwood said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive year of major budget cuts for the district that 
serves 8,889 students at five high schools in Whittier and Santa Fe Springs. 
Last year, the district's board of trustees cut $1.9 million from its 
$40-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to discuss the proposed budget at Tuesday night's 
meeting, and is expected to vote in late April or early May. The proposal would 
cut about $627,000 at the school level and about $812,000 at the district 
level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cutoff for Bus Service 
</P>
<P>
The budget would eliminate bus service in September for students who live less 
than three miles from school. The current cutoff for bus service is 2 1/2 
miles. California High School students would be the most heavily affected, with 
161 losing the service. 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the supervision of school libraries would save the district 
another $166,000. The budget proposes combining the career center at two 
schools with the library, an arrangement already in place at Whittier and 
Frontier high schools. The career center coordinator would supervise both 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four librarians whose positions are being eliminated, one will retire, 
one will resign and two willbecome teachers. The district will retain one 
librarian to supervise overall library services. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood said the district faces hard financial times for at least another two 
years until enrollment figures are projected to bottom out. Because the state 
funds schools based on average daily attendance, the decline of about 300 
students this school year cost the district $350,000 to $400,000, Eastwood 
said. Average daily attendance in the Whittier district has declined by about 
1,000 students since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment is expected to drop by another 50 students in the 1989-90 school 
year, according to district projections, then begin climbing again the next 
year. But because the state uses last year's enrollment figures to fund schools 
for the current year, Eastwood said, it will be two years before the district 
receives an increase in money from the state. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpected 32% increase in the cost of medical benefits for district 
employees and a state-required $250,000 increase in the district's worker's 
compensation fund also is responsible for the budget cuts, Eastwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed cuts in next year's budget include: 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating six periods each of athletics and freshman English because of 
declining enrollment, saving $209,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting 1 1/2 teaching positions at Frontier High School, the district's adult 
continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing summer school from seven to six weeks, saving about $33,000. A summer 
counseling program budget would be cut from $69,000 to $39,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting $15,000 from a fund that pays for school band and athletic trips. 
Parents and students would be asked to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting $50,000 from a $240,000 program that helps teen-age mothers earn high 
school degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the district's $50,000 contribution to the cafeteria. Food service 
managers would be responsible for implementing the cut, which might result in 
higher prices or fewer offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing salaries by about $300,000 at the district level, including 
eliminating the public relations consultant, a switchboard operator, a 
custodian, a janitor, one of the superintendent's two secretaries and eight 
clerical positions. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the Stay Well health and exercise program for district employees, 
which costs $37,000.

PUSH FOR L. B. POLICE REVIEW PANEL RENEWED 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city should create an independent investigator's office and a citizen 
review board to air complaints about police misconduct, according to 
recommendations of a special subcommittee of the Public Safety Advisory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals come in the wake of the January incident in which Officer Mark 
Dickey was secretly videotaped as he appeared to shove the head of black 
activist Don Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on administrative leave, 
through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has previously called for a citizen review board, but the City 
Council rejected the proposal. Commissioners say the council now may have a 
change of heart in light of the Jackson incident, which was videotaped as part 
of a sting to expose purported police abuses in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Larry Davis said he believes the incident has softened 
opposition to reforming the complaint process. "The recommendations are 
solutions to a credibility problem," he said. "We feel we offer reasonable 
oversight. This is an important step in bringing our community together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting on Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are scheduled to be presented to the 13-member commission 
at 7 p.m. Wednesday at a public meeting in the auditorium of the main city 
library in the City Hall complex. If approved by the full commission, they will 
once again go before the City Council for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Shoag, who chaired the subcommittee on which Davis and two other 
commissioners served, said the recommendations are an attempt to instill public 
faith in the conduct of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major goal was to open up the process in order to re-establish public 
confidence in the Police Department," Shoag said. She added that "certain 
segments" of the committee feel that they are not respected by the police, a 
reference to minority organizations that have repeatedly complained about 
alleged police brutality and mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints could be filed either with the Police Department or the independent 
investigator, but each office would make copies for the other, according to the 
subcommittee's report. A monthly complaint tally would be sent to the City 
Council and commission. 
</P>
<P>
An independent investigator would be hired by the city manager and serve under 
his direction. The citizen complaint board would consist of seven residents 
with diverse ethnicity and background, appointed by the mayor, the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The independent investigator's office would check into all in-custody deaths, 
excessive force complaints, false arrest complaints or any complaints with 
racist or sexist overtones. It would also consider appeals of cases rejected by 
police internal affairs officers. 
</P>
<P>
On each case of alleged police misconduct, one or two members of the board 
would be appointed to act as liaisons with the independent investigator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Would Have Subpoena Powers 
</P>
<P>
The liaisons would review all the reports, interview the independent 
investigator and preside over a public hearing during which the review board 
would sustain or dismiss allegations. The board would have subpoena powers and 
conduct fact finding, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
Shoag said the system, is modeled after a similar program in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
She said the new system would not duplicate efforts of the Civil Service 
Commission, which only hears appeals of police officers who are disciplined, or 
the City Council, which usually refers complaints to the Police Department for 
review. 
</P>
<P>
She expressed confidence that the recommendations will be favorably received by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
When informed of the proposals, Councilman Ray Grabinski said he likes the idea 
of an independent investigator's office, but remains opposed to a citizen 
review board. "Sometimes they (police officers) are belligerent, sometimes they 
are ignorant, sometimes they break the law. But for me, I don't want civilians 
deciding police tactics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be Supportive' 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark said he believes there is enough public interest in a 
police review board to put the issue on the ballot. As for an investigator, he 
said, "I would be supportive and I would be surprised if the council is not." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley said he will need more information before 
taking a position on the subcommittee's proposals, but that he will support the 
wishes of the City Council. He questioned whether public hearings could be 
conducted into police officer conduct without violating confidentiality laws. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James C. Hankla said he, too, is considering the possibility of 
recommending an independent investigator. He pointed out that he has opposed a 
citizen review board in the past, but would take a fresh look if requested by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee also recommends extending the probationary period for rookie 
officers beyond the current one year. Binkley said he has no objection. 
</P>
<P>
The report also calls for extra pay for bilingual officers, which Binkley said 
he supports. Currently, civilian employees receive an extra $10 a week for 
bilingual skills, but police officers receive no extra pay.

DIAMOND BAR STUCK WITH BILL FOR ROAD WORK

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some members of the City Council-elect are upset with Los Angeles County after 
learning last week that $2.8 million in road repairs need to be done in their 
new city and that the county is planning to reallocate $400,000 that was to pay 
for a Diamond Bar park. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, who were elected March 7 and will take office when Diamond Bar 
incorporates April 18, received these revelations during meetings last week 
with county staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous," said Mayor Pro Tem-elect Paul Horcher. "They literally 
dropped a bomb on us." 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Bugh, the county's deputy director of public works, gave the council a 
list of public works projects that will need attention during the next few 
years. The largest single project is widening the Pathfinder Road overpass 
across the Orange Freeway, estimated to cost $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members angrily questioned why some of these projects had not been 
completed earlier by the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Developments 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these projects date back to some of the earlier developments in 
Diamond Bar," said City Councilman-elect Gary Werner. "There really is no 
excuse for that kind of public works deficiency to exist. . . . It reflects 
poorly on the handling of revenues for our community. As far as I'm concerned, 
this community has been getting the short end of the stick for years." 
</P>
<P>
Council members were also angered by a county Department of Parks and 
Recreation decision to reallocate $409,000 in grant money that had been 
earmarked for Sylvan Glen Park in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought they were going to finish (the park) up" this year, Horcher said. 
"But once the incorporation movement got cooking, they sat on their plans." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the money had been earmarked in state bond measures for 
development of the park. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jim Park, the county's head park planner, said the money was part of 
$2.8 million allocated by the state to develop parks in the county. With the 
incorporation of Diamond Bar, Park said his department decided the money could 
be better spent in an unincorporated area elsewhere in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly many unmet needs throughout the county and many unmet 
needs in the east San Gabriel Valley," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman-elect John Forbing said the information provided by the county staff 
is not set in stone. He said he hopes city officials and members of Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum's staff can work out agreements on public works and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the City Council to negotiate with the county and see what we can 
get," Forbing said. "Schabarum's the source of all funding." 
</P>
<P>
Werner said an agreement with the county on the park issue could be reached 
"when they agree to provide the funding" for Sylvan Glen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Discussions 
</P>
<P>
At this point, negotiations on Diamond Bar's contracting for county services 
have been limited to discussions among the county staff, the council and 
interim City Manager George Caswell. However, those on both sides hope that 
disagreements on the cost of services and related issues will be resolved in 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always room for negotiation until the contract is signed," Schabarum 
aide Ray Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>

MILLIONS AT STAKE IN SUIT CHALLENGING HOW PROP. 13 ALLOCATES PROPERTY TAXES

<P>
Several Southeast cities could gain millions of dollars more a year in tax 
revenues if a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the property tax 
allocation system under Proposition 13 is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood, for example, could get as much as $3 million more a year and Compton 
$1.4 million, depending on how the courts rule on the suit being pressed by 
Compton and four other small Los Angeles County cities. They are arguing that 
their residents pay more property taxes than their city governments get back 
under the tax distribution system created to implement Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"It violates the principle that the people that pay the tax ought to get the 
benefit from it," said John Sturgeon, attorney for the five cities. 
</P>
<P>
But Long Beach would lose about $7 million a year in property tax revenues if a 
court rules in favor of the small cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Join in Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Carson, El Segundo, Rancho Cucamonga and Temple City have joined Compton in 
challenging the allocation formula, which favors cities that had high tax rates 
before Proposition 13, the statewide tax revolt referendum approved by 
California voters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"This lawsuit is not about Proposition 13," said Rodney Smith, economic 
consultant for the petitioners. "It is (about) the way the legislation was 
written that allocated the property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Of 85 cities in Los Angeles County, Smith said, "there are only a few that are 
benefiting (under the allocation system). Most are losing and the reason is 
that (prior to) Proposition 13, the tax rates levied by the cities were very 
skewed. There were a handful of high tax rate cities (but) most were relatively 
low." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 limited taxes to 1% of assessed valuation and restricted 
increases in the assessments to 2% annually, meaning the tax rate is the same 
for taxpayers regardless of the city. On the distribution side, however, the 
revenues are given back to the cities according to what their tax rates were 
prior to Proposition 13, meaning cities that had high rates now receive get 
back the biggest share of the tax dollar. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Compton residents, who enjoyed a lower-than-average tax rate 
before Proposition 13, paid property taxes totaling $14.9 million in 1986-87 
but their city government got back only $1.58 million. 
</P>
<P>
That is about 14 cents on the tax dollar, according to data Smith supplied for 
the petitioners. By comparison, Smith says, the city of Los Angeles, which had 
a high tax rate before Proposition 13, got back about 36 cents on the tax 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Cities Harder Hit 
</P>
<P>
Some cities are even harder hit in terms of the property tax dollar. Temple 
City, for instance, does not get a single tax dollar back even though its 
residents paid $7.5 million in property taxes in 1986-87. The city did not have 
a property tax before Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"We were excluded forever" from receiving benefits, Temple City Manager Karl 
Koski said of his community, which has never levied a property tax. 
</P>
<P>
About 33 cities in the county did not have a property tax or were not yet 
incorporated when Proposition 13 was passed, says Sam Olivito, executive 
director of the California Contract Cities Assn., which is supporting the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in the state Supreme Court a month ago but the court 
declined without comment to hear the case. Last week, however, attorneys for 
the petitioners were filing suit in San Bernardino Superior Court. That county 
was chosen, he said, because Rancho Cucamonga is located there and is one of 
the biggest losers under the allocation system. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was originally filed with the state's highest court because the issue 
is constitutional and the decision could affect cities statewide, Sturgeon 
said. He had urged the court to act quickly because cities have to begin 
planning their 1989-90 budgets soon. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City Councilman Ken Gillanders, who initiated the research leading to 
the suit, was not perturbed by the action by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll just take a little longer to resolve, but the constitutional issues are 
the same," he said. "It will ultimately find its way to the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
270 Cities Would Benefit 
</P>
<P>
If the suit is successful and the allocation formula is changed, 270 cities 
statewide would benefit, said Olivito of the Contract Cities Assn. The group, 
which has written to the court in support of the action, represents 65 
California cities, 46 of them in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks the court to order Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to 
correct the alleged inequities. The counties were named as respondents in the 
suit because they collect residents' property taxes and distribute them to 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit suggests that a fairer distribution system would rely on the total 
value of properties in a city to determine what proportion of the tax-revenue 
pie it should receive. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City would have gained about $1.46 million in revenues in fiscal 1986-87 
under the proposed system. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner among the petitioners would be El Segundo, which would have 
received $7 million more that year. The city had a property tax of 0.15% in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
As with Long Beach, six cities in the San Gabriel Valley, including Pomona and 
Pasadena, would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars each year if the court 
orders the allocation formula changed. The city of Los Angeles would lose 
almost $117 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the current revenue allocation system violates a 
provision in the state Constitution requiring that taxpayers directly benefit 
from the taxes they are paying. 
</P>
<P>
Cities with high pre-Proposition 13 tax rates receive more than their fair 
share of revenues, violating another constitutional provision mandating uniform 
taxation, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which had the county's highest property tax, 2.76%, in 1978, is 
cited as profiting the most from the current system. The city received at least 
$117 million more in property tax revenues than its residents paid in the 
1986-87 fiscal year, said Smith, the consultant for the petitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would bear 95% of the losses under the proposal, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stressed that county tax revenues are in a separate pool from the cities' 
revenues and would not be affected by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Olivito said the petitioning cities have long felt that "something just wasn't 
right" and have repeatedly approached the state Legislature about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to find a solution for the last 10 years, and we haven't 
received a dollar," he said. "The issue just kept snowballing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALLOCATIONS OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed by five Southern California cities attacks- the way that property 
tax revenue is allocated to cities. Their suit challenges the constitutionality 
of the distribution system that was enacted to implement Proposition 13. If 
successful, the suit could shift millions of dollars among city coffers 
statewide. The following is a breakdown of the tax revenue received by cities 
in the Southeast/Long Beach area under the existing system and the distribution 
under the proposed reforms.

OFFICER IN BIAS CASE FIRED AFTER 1 YEAR ON LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The black police officer whose allegations of racial discrimination jolted the 
Santa Monica Police Department has lost his job after remaining on a leave of 
absence for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Henry McCray, a 12-year veteran on the force, will be asked to turn in 
his badge this week, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
McCray went on a stress-related leave without pay in January, 1988. He said at 
the time that certain white officers failed to give him adequate backup and 
that he suffered other racially motivated harassment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threatens to Sue 
</P>
<P>
City officials said McCray's dismissal was part of normal procedures and was 
not caused by his allegations. But McCray labeled the action "underhanded" and 
threatened to sue for wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
Officials cited the city's Municipal Code, which states that an employee may 
take a leave of absence for no longer than one year. 
</P>
<P>
"The code sets up very specific limitations (on leaves). We have no choice," 
said Personnel Director Karen Bancroft. "We cannot make an exception." 
</P>
<P>
A letter signed by Police Chief James Keane was sent to McCray last month, 
notifying him that if he did not return to work within two weeks, he would be 
terminated. 
</P>
<P>
The only response was a note from McCray's doctor, stating he was still unfit 
to work, Bancroft said. 
</P>
<P>
McCray, in an interview at his home in Hawthorne, said he would have liked to 
return to the Santa Monica police force but that he feared for his safety 
because officers he accused of bias resented him. 
</P>
<P>
Among his allegations, McCray, 37, claims that his radio calls for assistance 
were ignored on several occasions, that other officers tried to set him up by 
hiding guns in his patrol car to make it look as though he had failed to disarm 
suspects and that officers harassed him by jamming his locker. Further, he 
says, in 12 years on the force he was never given a special assignment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Surprised 
</P>
<P>
"The place was going to drive me crazy," he said, adding that losing his job 
now was almost anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
"Firing was not the worst they could do to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said they investigated McCray's claims that he was not receiving 
backup but could find no evidence to support them. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to McCray, Keane said that with commercial and hotel development 
in Santa Monica growing rapidly, demands on the police force are also growing. 
He is asking that additional officers be hired and said he could not afford to 
leave McCray's position unfilled any longer. 
</P>
<P>
In February, McCray joined five other current and former Santa Monica police 
officers in a lawsuit accusing the department and city of systematic racial 
bias in hiring and promotion. Although the suit was filed in Superior Court, it 
has yet to be served, and McCray said he and the other plaintiffs are now at 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sting' Alliance 
</P>
<P>
McCray also joined forces with activist Don Jackson, a Hawthorne police 
sergeant on leave from that department who has gained fame for staging "stings" 
to expose alleged police abuse of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Together, McCray and Jackson headed the Law Enforcement Officers for Justice, a 
small organization of black and Asian police and security officers that opposed 
discrimination in agencies throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
However, the two men had a falling out last year over how to conduct their 
crusade and they have not spoken since June, McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations of racial discrimination brought by McCray and other black 
officers sent shock waves through the Santa Monica police force. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the city hired a consultant to survey the problem, appointed 
Bancroft as ombudsman, established a committee to oversee department policies 
and instituted changes in its promotional procedures. 
</P>
<P>
McCray has praised some of the steps taken but likened them to "putting a 
Band-Aid on a deep wound."

STATE BOARD, NOT COURT, TO DECIDE WHAT IS OWED; 
</P>
<P>
EX-MASSAGE PARLOR OWNER REBUFFED ON TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Superior Court judge has ruled that it is up to the state Franchise Tax Board 
to determine how much money former college professor and massage parlor owner 
Hal Mintz owes in unpaid taxes stemming from his no contest plea to two counts 
of state income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David Perez, who last December sentenced Mintz to four years probation 
after Mintz pleaded no contest to the tax charges and to conspiracy to maintain 
a house of prostitution, had been expected to decide the matter. 
</P>
<P>
But last Wednesday the judge tossed the decision back to the Franchise Tax 
Board after an attorney for the state argued that the court had no authority to 
rule on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The state claims that Mintz owes more than $80,000 for 1985 and 1986. Mintz 
claims that the amount is less than $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Appeals Process 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Glassman, a lawyer for Mintz, asked that the judge set the amount, 
saying that to go through a long appeals process with the Franchise Tax Board 
would present a "financial burden" that his client is unable to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz resigned from his $45,000-a-year post at East Los Angeles College last 
August after widespread publicity about his massage parlor in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
He had taught at the college for 19 years and was chairman of its business 
department at the time of his resignation. Mintz has since gone to work as an 
assistant office manager for a commercial real estate and development company. 
</P>
<P>
His massage parlor, at 8574 Santa Monica Blvd., across from City Hall in West 
Hollywood, was closed in February, 1988, after authorities said it was being 
used as a house of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, at least 10 women had 
been arrested for sex-related offenses there since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failure to File 
</P>
<P>
The tax evasion charges stemmed from Mintz's failure to file a return with the 
Franchise Tax Board for 1985 and 1986. Prosecutors said that records seized at 
Mintz's home in San Marino showed that the he earned at least $200,000 each of 
those years. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain arrangement, prosecutors agreed not to charge the 
former professor with pimping and pandering, which carry mandatory state prison 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing four years of probation, the judge ordered that one year be spent 
under house arrest, and that Mintz pay $10,000 in fines and all taxes owed the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mintz has assumed all costs of his house arrest, which authorities 
say amounts to about $10 a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electronic Transmitter 
</P>
<P>
He was fitted with an electronic transmitter that allows law enforcement 
officials to ensure that he does not leave his home except for work, religious 
services or medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The beeper-like device, which Mintz wears strapped above his ankle, is about 
the size of a chalk board eraser, and sends signals every 72 seconds through a 
transmitter connected through his telephone to a surveillance office in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Glassman argued that the plea bargain arrangement with 
prosecutors stipulated that a judge would determine the amount of taxes Mintz 
owes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge agreed with Deputy Atty. Gen. Herbert Levin, who argued that 
the courts have jurisdiction over such matters only after the appeals process 
provided by the Franchise Tax Board has been exhausted.

OUTTAKES: THE BEAUTY INSIDE

When actress Wendy Gazelle showed up on the Auschwitz set of "Triumph of the 
Spirit," her thick curly dark hair cascaded past her shoulders ("I'd never had 
short hair in my life"). Her role as Allegra, a young Greek concentration camp 
prisoner, changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
Gazelle -- love interest of Willem Dafoe, a Greek boxing champ forced by the 
Nazis to fight -- and long-tressed Kelly Wolf, who plays her sister, were among 
the "prisoners" whose heads were shaved on camera. 
</P>
<P>
Director Robert M. Young helped Gazelle prepare for the humiliating shaving 
scene the night before by telling the actress, "After this happens, we'll look 
for you to be beautiful inside.' " 
</P>
<P>
The sequence, calling for the women to be naked, was filmed on a closed set, 
with "SS women" hacking away at the hair of the prisoners and then shaving 
them. Gazelle had no trouble summoning up tears. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, God, I couldn't stop crying," she said. "But I tried to think like my 
character -- who's a survivor. I tried to think, 'They're taking away a 
material thing -- but they can't take away me.' " 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Young approached Gazelle with tears in his eyes and said, "I 
feel like a monster." 
</P>
<P>
Dafoe, Edward James Olmos, Robert Loggia and dozens of male extras suffered 
similarly. 
</P>
<P>
In a show of solidarity, some non-actors associated with the movie also had 
their heads shaved -- including Dean Pollack, on location filming a "Making of 
'Triumph of the Spirit' " documentary, and Evan Kopelson, producer of that 
project and son of "Triumph" producer Arnold Kopelson. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: VERY, VERY UNOFFICIAL

Universal's "The Dream Team," an Imagine Entertainment comedy about four mental 
patients left on their own overnight in NYC, has gotten some favorable reviews. 
But while praising its laugh quotient, Daily Variety's Todd McCarthy also 
criticized it as "a hokey comedy that basically reduces mental illness to a 
grab bag of quirky shtick . . . the way in which the mentally handicapped 
characters are used (for yuks) is occasionally off-putting and unsettling." 
</P>
<P>
Co-writer/co-producer Jon Connolly assured us that he and partner David Loucka 
pored over case histories and "talked to seven, maybe eight, psychiatrists" for 
accuracy's sake and to make the film "as real as possible in a comedy context." 
He named Greenwich, Conn., psychiatrist John Tamerin and noted NYC psychologist 
Albert Ellis as "unofficial consultants." 
</P>
<P>
So we called them. 
</P>
<P>
"Jon is a good friend, and I don't want to hurt his movie," said Tamerin, "but 
clearly, to suggest that this movie is based on psychiatric information -- 
particularly from me -- would be utterly preposterous. He mentioned that he was 
writing this thing, and that was about it. I totally eschew any 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
An assistant of Ellis told us the psychologist didn't "have much of a 
recollection" of speaking to anyone from "Dream Team" -- "a lot of people from 
Hollywood call and talk for a minute or two." 
</P>
<P>
Tamerin called the movie "a farce, a burlesque, a caricature of some extreme 
kinds of mental illness. The fact that it deals with psychiatry instead of 
fraternity houses is almost irrelevant. . . . It's like it's from Mars in terms 
of psychiatric reality." Stacy Jenel Smith

Joanna Carson has inked a deal with Warner Books to write her autobiography. 
But the wealthy divorcee apparently won't use the book to get back at ex-hubby 
Johnny Carson for all those barbed divorce-and-alimony comments on "The Tonight 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
Producer/manager Michael Viner, who set the book deal, acknowledged that it 
will cover the 11 years -- 1972 to 1983 -- that Joanna was married to Carson, 
as well as their acrimonious divorce. But that won't be the focus, he told us. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a 'Mommie Dearest,' not in any way a 'tell-all' book," Viner said. 
"It's an autobiography covering her whole life . . . the story of a woman who 
scraped by all her life, who suddenly finds herself married to the king of 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
(Joanna is simultaneously working on a Warner Books novel, "Glass Houses," due 
out next year, and the untitled autobiography, which has no deadline.) 
</P>
<P>
Joanna "won't comment" on any of this, Viner added. "The last thing she wants 
to do is get involved in any controversy having to do with Johnny Carson." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Carson reportedly gets the tough treatment in Laurence Leamer's 
"King of the Night," due from William Morrow this summer. Stacy Jenel Smith

DANCEWATCHING: POWER OF THEIR PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Brown is standing still and breathing hard, his powerfully built torso 
soaked in sweat. Elisa Monte, a lean and intense-looking woman, emerges from 
darkness and grabs his thighs and then his arms. They tumble to the floor, 
intoxicated by their love making. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Monte are husband and wife, dancer and choreographer -- and this 
moment from a piece called "Treading" represents both an idealization of their 
intimacy and a vision of the blatantly visceral style of dance that Monte has 
come to represent in the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Her nine-member, New York-based company can be seen Tuesday at the UC Riverside 
University Theatre on its first West Coast tour. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Treading' did seem very raw to people when it was first done (in 1979)," 
recalls Monte, referring to a duet that is now part of the Alvin Ailey and San 
Francisco Ballet repertories. "But I really don't think of doing a sexy dance 
when choreographing. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to think there's a difference between sexuality and sensuality," she 
adds, "sensuality having to do with the body and its general response to the 
world, and sexuality being more specifically related to procreation and 
intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown thinks there's a more profound sexual underpinning to Monte's work. 
"I've always seen 'Treading' as the painful, joyous act of Elisa giving birth," 
he offers, "not necessarily to a human, or an idea, but to herself as an artist 
and choreographer in her own right." 
</P>
<P>
Monte was renowned as a principal dancer with the Lar Lubovitch, Pilobolus and 
Martha Graham dance companies before forming her own troupe in 1982. She firmly 
established herself as a creator during a concert at the 1984 Brooklyn Academy 
of Music season when she broke out of the mold of the politically conservative, 
balletic, AIDS-saturated '80s. Sexuality on the dance floor had clearly not 
died with the sexual revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that male and female . . . no, human sexuality . . . has a great 
deal to do with my sense of dance rhythm and drama," Monte says. "But I think 
that instinct comes less from the libido than from a very strong feeling that 
dance should not be decorative or just entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound somewhat corny," she says, "but I think artists have a 
responsibility to dispel the demons of society through the seriousness of our 
gestures -- through lessons about love and hate, and through our honesty in 
dealing with our bodies and the pleasures they do in fact offer." 
</P>
<P>
If she sounds like reconstituted Martha Graham, her message hits a generation 
facing AIDS, substance abuse and the need to conserve dwindling natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
"The body contains a lot of hidden messages," she says, emphasizing that "even 
if sex isn't always possible" there's a need "to demonstrate the deep 
connection between us" in order to "forestall self-destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, this drive to "make dances about the body and survival" has been 
partly fueled by Monte's growing love of Indonesia, cultivated during tours to 
Java and Bali in '86 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
But there may be another source of Monte's unabashed sensuality on stage: her 
refusal to deny the passion between her and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The two have shared her vision for more than 10 years; Brown is now associate 
director of her company. They also have a 5-year-old girl, Elia, who has 
accompanied them throughout their tours. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a soft-spoken Jamaican who has himself choreographed for the company, 
has long been a favorite of audiences who find him one of the more strikingly 
handsome men in any modern dance company. He's also applauded for his prowess 
and keen intelligence on stage. 
</P>
<P>
As Monte's partner and the company's most outspoken leader, he has plenty of 
opinions about how sexuality jump-starts the works he dances. 
</P>
<P>
"A good dancer dances for himself and is totally naked," like "a great stripper 
who can't see the grubby audience because of the glaring lights," and therefore 
only "plays" for himself, not the audience. 
</P>
<P>
For Monte's part, she believes that dancing with her husband has allowed her to 
approach "a more genuine and deeply felt sensuousness" than other companies 
"muster," allowing her to integrate passionately her life with her art. 
</P>
<P>
But the marriage of true minds, apparently hasn't evolved without its share of 
woe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brown, "sometimes I have screamed when yet another one of my 
(choreographic) ideas gets subsumed under the name 'Elisa Monte Dance Company.' 
" And, according to Monte, "it's been pretty rough going at times . . . We've 
had to talk out a lot about who is good at choreographing, who is good at 
teaching." 
</P>
<P>
And Monte suggests that she has tried to dissolve distinctions between her 
deepest inner life and her public persona with the help of Brown's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it what you will: sexual, sensual, dancing, being alive. To me it's just 
a way to fight the alienation that's in your blood if you live in this world . 
. . a way to connect with something greater than just yourself."

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: PIANIST BRYAN PEZZONE: BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now recovered from injuries sustained in a mugging that occurred in early 
February, pianist Bryan Pezzone says his hand is now "doing great," and he has 
begun playing the piano again. 
</P>
<P>
Pezzone's left hand suffered a deep cut during the incident, endangering his 
ring finger. A month later, the pianist underwent hand surgery. "The finger is 
numb, but feels great," he said last week. How does the rest of Pezzone feel? 
</P>
<P>
"Really well. Somehow, this whole experience has become positive. I guess 
that's a decision I made, early on -- not to let it get me down. I don't know 
if I would feel the same way if I hadn't been able to play again, though. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
The CalArts faculty artist will play in public soon too, first at a private 
birthday concert for Nicolas Slonimsky being cooked up by the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic and MOCA, on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
Then a week later, at a Green Umbrella series concert with the New CalArts 
Twentieth Century Players, at the Japan America Theatre, May 8. Brand-new works 
by Morton Subotnick and James Tenney will highlight that concert, as well as 
other pieces by Michael Jon Fink, and George Antheil's historic "Ballet 
mecanique"." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working harder, getting up earlier, and using my energy in new ways," the 
26-year-old pianist/composer explained, relating how his life is different 
since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming season, he said, he and his wife, flutist Susan Pezzone, will 
perform together in public more than they have been able to do, recently. 
Already, he is putting in more time on his own compositions. His entire career 
seems to be coming into focus, he commented. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all this, and of spending all those weeks at home, recovering, I think 
I've got a greater appreciation for life in general, and for a lot of small 
things I used to take for granted." Even the apparent necessity of acquiring 
two German shepherds has been a positive, Pezzone feels. "We love these dogs. 
But they need us, too, and that's a whole new set of responsibilities for us to 
arrange into our lives. It feels good." 
</P>
<P>
BRIEFLY: Robert Duerr, who joined the musical staff of the Metropolitan Opera 
at the beginning of this season, will make his conducting debut with the

Many write about the down-and-out, but few do so with the humanizing touch of 
Peter Case. On his second solo album, the singer-songwriter relates what he's 
seen while "standing on the corner of Walk and Don't Walk," with a feeling that 
goes well beyond compassion, and with a minimum of moralizing. 
</P>
<P>
On his 1986 solo debut, Case spun a series of vivid allegories involving 
American heroes, dreamers and losers, all set to a dynamic musical tapestry. In 
contrast, these songs play it straight, both musically and lyrically. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangements draw effectively, if sometimes predictably, from various 
American styles, from the acoustic country blues of the traditional "Charlie 
James" to the "Highway 61 Revisited"-like, freewheeling free-association of 
"This Town's a Riot." The album may not have the invention of the debut, but 
the loose, personal feel makes a fine substitute. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is always Case's skill as a storyteller. And though he presents 
a world that seems pretty bleak, Case underscores it all with a sense of hope, 
expressed in the closing testimony to faith that "someone sees the dreams we 
hide." STEVE HOCHMAN

Sometimes he sounds like his dad, which is natural enough. Sometimes he affects 
the deep-voiced theatricality of the post-punk legion ofDavid Bowie imitators. 
But, most of all, Julian Lennon sounds here as if he hasn't an original thought 
in his head, nor any expressive means that transcend cliche. Producer Patrick 
Leonard tries to keep it interesting with a host of studio tricks and a small 
army of supporting players, but all that isn't worth much if the key songwriter 
doesn't dare to imagine. In the course of three albums, Lennon has gone from 
winsome to forgettable to soporific. MIKE BOEHM

ART NEWS: AIDS PHOTOS DEPICT A WILL TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rosalind Solomon's photographs of people with AIDS confront the viewer with a 
greater verism than most media images have shown. 
</P>
<P>
Assembled in the exhibit "Portraits in the Time of AIDS," currently at UC San 
Diego's Grove Gallery through Saturday, Solomon's pictures show a young man 
raising his arms overhead to reveal the dark lesions covering his chest; 
another, lying in his hospital bed, breathing through an oxygen mask; a third, 
glaring at the camera with a mix of profound sadness and defiant anger. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that has always been of concern to me is the fact that we 
are unwilling to accept death as a part of life," Solomon said. "As a culture, 
we've been taught that death doesn't exist, that we're supposed to be youthful 
forever -- to live forever." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon's images definitely embrace mortality. Yet, the New York-based 
photographer, many of whose past subjects have been Third World peoples living 
in appalling poverty, always strives to portray her subjects with compassion 
and as survivors, not defeated souls. 
</P>
<P>
As she writes in the exhibit catalogue: "In this series of pictures, my goal 
was to reveal a special character, a relationship, an environment, aspects of 
the human struggle to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon, who came to know those depicted in the 52-piece exhibit at weekly 
dinners for people with AIDS at a church in New York, said their attitudes, 
most of the time, were positive. Though conversation at these dinners included 
talk of doctors, medication and treatment, the tone and the words, were about 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any contact with groups of people with terminal illness, but I 
think the kind of support that exists within the community of people who have 
AIDS is remarkable," she said. "And the kind of positive attitudes toward life 
were quite a revelation to me. Of course, not everybody had that kind of 
approach."

WHEN DRINKING WINE AT ORSO, DO AS THE ROMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is this someone's idea of a joke? Where did this idea come from? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way they do it in Italy," I have been told, on three occasions, when 
restaurants have tried to foist off tiny little water glasses with no stems as 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Baloney. Fine restaurants in Italy serve wine in real, honest-to-God stemware. 
</P>
<P>
So dining in Orso the other night was another setback to the truth. "It's the 
way they do it in Italy," we heard again as the glassware brought to our table 
revealed itself to be squat, open-mouth little bowls better suited for finger 
washing or for sipping Cognac "neat" after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
But not for wine. And certainly not for wine that needs to be swirled to get 
full enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
But the folks at Orso know better. Moreover, they know that in Italy, the wine 
bottles are uncorked and left for you to pour. So that's the way it works at 
Orso, too. Isn't that cute? Waiter approaches with wine, shows you label to 
approve, and after you've nodded, he pulls the cork, plops the bottle down and 
disappears. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if the wine is corked or so badly stored that you want to reject 
it? I suppose you wave at your waiter as he whizzes past to serve William 
Devane his pizzetta. (Fortunately, our wine was not spoiled.) 
</P>
<P>
The problem with this kind of non-service is its price. At the few Italian 
dining spots where I have experienced the water-glass/no-service regime, I have 
also paid next to nothing for my meal. These were quite literally roadside 
cafes where the wine is $2 a liter. 
</P>
<P>
At Orso, the price of the wine is roughly three times wholesale, or twice 
retail. That, I contend, is simply too high for a non-wine-glass, non-service 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The list itself, almost all Italian, isn't bad. Some of the better buys in 
white wines include 1985 Gavi Villa Scolca at $22; 1987 Antinori Galestro at 
$14, and a Frescobaldi Chianti (1985 Castello di Nipozzano) at $19. These are 
good wines for the money. 
</P>
<P>
Three red wines worth trying are 1985 Chianti Classico Castello di Cacchiano 
($20); 1986 Bruno Giacosa Barbera D'Alba ($21), and 1986 Luigi Einaudi Nebbiolo 
($20). 
</P>
<P>
But other wines are overpriced, such as the lovely 1987 Blange, an Arneis from 
Bruno Ceretto. This spicy and floral wine is $29 here, $15 on most store 
shelves. Also, to order the 1978 Lungarotti Rubesco Riserva ($45) and have it 
poured into a glass you can't swirl 
</P>
<P>
is a waste of a good aroma. 
</P>
<P>
To state that the prices here are too high for the glassware and service may 
seem unfair. Certainly I'm not comparing Orso to some roadside diner outside of 
Milan. The food is far better here, but it is annoying to be paying these 
prices for such "traditional" service. 
</P>
<P>
The way things are going, some day soon I expect to enter a restaurant, order a 
bottle of wine and have the waiter bring it with no glassware at all. He will 
tell me that I am supposed to slug it straight from the bottle because, "Hey, 
the Romans never used glassware."

ORSO, SO SO; 
</P>
<P>
20 REASONS TO LOVE AND HATE L.A.'S NEWEST CELEBRITY HANGOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orso, 8706 W. Third Street, Los Angeles. (213) 274-7144. Open for lunch and 
dinner daily. Full bar. Valet parking. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for 
two, food only, $45-$75. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten reasons to go to Orso: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Because the menu is one of the most appealing in town. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Because the kitchen is imaginative enough to change that menu every day. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- To see how Joe Allen, a beer and sawdust sort of place, has been 
transformed into a cool Italian trattoria with an open kitchen and the 
prettiest plates you've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Because it is the only upscale restaurant in Los Angeles gutsy enough to 
serve lamb's head, complete with the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Because Orso has become a remarkably low-key celebrity spot where you 
really do feel that everybody is treated equally. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- For the wonderful bread, which is served for free. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Because this is one of the few restaurants in Los Angeles that routinely 
offers cheese as part of the menu (Gorgonzola, mascarpone, Parmesan, goat 
cheese) -- and doesn't ask you to part with a fortune for it. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Because the patio -- walled-in so you can't see the traffic -- is one of 
the few nice places to eat outdoors in this part of town. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- For the side orders of vegetables -- roasted potatoes with garlic, sauteed 
spinach, broccoli with olive oil and lemon. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- For the truly delightful blood orange ice. 
</P>
<P>
Ten reasons not to go to Orso: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Because the food on the menu all sounds better than it tastes. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Because the quality of the food varies enormously, and the changing menu 
makes it impossible to find a dish that you like and order it every time you 
come. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Because the mismatched chairs in this trendy trattoria are incredibly 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Because if you are an adventurous eater, you will be tempted to order the 
lamb's head. And because if you do, you'll be sorry. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Because the service here, while snappy and efficient, is so low-key that 
you have the feeling that the management hasn't even noticed that the 
celebrities are present. And if they don't notice the rich and famous, how do 
you expect them to notice you? 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Because the inexplicably popular pizza bread costs $5.50 a basket and 
tastes like matzos topped with burnt garlic. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Because while the prices do not seem out of line, by the time you've spent 
$8 for an appetizer, $18 for an entree, had a few vegetables and a little 
cheese, the bill in this casual little restaurant is anything but casual. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Because the valet parking, in the lot next to the restaurant, is so tight 
that you wonder if you're going to get in -- or out -- alive. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Because those side orders of vegetables are tiny -- and cost $4. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Because the blood orange ice is the only wonderful dessert on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
When all is said and done, this is the real question about Orso: With all the 
wonderful trattorias in Los Angeles, why choose this one? 
</P>
<P>
You might choose it for the way that it looks and feels: it has the simplicity 
of a true Italian trattoria. And sitting outside on a warm evening, surrounded 
by beautiful people in casual clothes all talking with great animation, you can 
easily imagine yourself right into any cosmopolitan capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The menu fuels this fantasy. It is a wonderfully appealing piece of paper, with 
a sense of adventure missing in most other restaurants. While you might not 
want to go quite as far as the lamb's head (my main objection was not the eye, 
which was looking at the plate and not at me, but the fact that it offered very 
little to eat), most of the unusual dishes are not outrageous. On any given 
evening, you are likely to find stewed tripe as an appetizer (wonderful), or 
smoked eel served with white beans and roast shallots (delicious). Pasta dishes 
might include something simple such as fusilli with roast tomato and olives -- 
and something more complicated such as black taglierini topped with grilled 
squid, slices of fennel, tomato, garlic and olive oil (a good idea and a pretty 
presentation, but I would have liked a bit more squid). 
</P>
<P>
It's nice that nobody has warned the kitchen that we don't like innards, and 
that the entrees are likely to include sweetbreads sauteed with prosciutto and 
Madeira. Most nights there is pan fried calf's liver with onions. And the 
appetizers -- dishes like grilled spinach and sausage polenta with fontina, 
warm artichoke salads with prosciutto, mozzarella and black olives or a salad 
of dandelion greens, endive, tomato and shavings of Parmesan cheese -- are not 
exactly your ordinary offerings. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the appeal of the menu, many dishes simply don't work. The pizzas 
I've tasted have all been disappointingly lackluster. The classic pizza 
Margherita tasted like melted cheese and tomato sauce on crackers. Appetizers 
generally sound better on paper than they taste in the mouth. The ingredients 
in that warm artichoke salad turned out not to have a lot to say to each other. 
The polenta was just a tired fried square of stuff. A tuna and octopus salad 
with capers, red onion and tomato contained delightfully tender octopus -- and 
terribly tough tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Pastas have been hit or miss. Taglietelle with grilled vegetables was pure 
delight, but ravioli stuffed with ricotta and chard were mushy, and an inept 
sauce of tomatoes and black olives didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
And for every entree I have loved -- a wonderful plate of bronzino served on a 
bed of wilted lettuce, radicchio and watercress, for instance -- there has been 
one that I didn't -- very ordinary lamb chops. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I know I'll be back. For while this trattoria lacks the warmth of 
Locanda Veneta, the reliable hipness of Angeli or the elegant pizazz of Pazzia, 
it has an appeal all its own. You may not be interested in knowing that Joe 
Allen (who still owns the restaurant) has so successfully remodeled his place. 
Watching Terri Garr eat a plate of pasta at the next table may not be your sort 
of thrill. And you may never want to see a lamb's head sitting on your plate. 
But once you get done playing 20 questions, one main fact remains: There is a 
lovely new patio in town where you can count on getting a fine salad, a plate 
of pasta, a piece of cheese and a cool tart orange ice that leaves a very good 
taste in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: arugula, endive and tomato salad with Parmesan, $7; 
taglietelle with grilled vegetables, $12; veal scaloppine, $18; bronzino on 
wilted greens, $18; roasted potatoes with garlic, $4; cheese, $3.50; blood 
orange ice, $4.

117 ARRESTED IN S.D. ABORTION DEMONSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 anti-abortion protesters were arrested by police Saturday after 
they temporarily closed access to the office of a Hillcrest doctor who performs 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who had warning of the demonstration, sent more than 100 officers to 
surround the building that houses the Third Avenue offices of Dr. Donald G. 
Byrnes. By the end of the protest, 117 people associated with Project Rescue 
had been arrested -- 109 on misdemeanor charges and 8 on suspicion of felony 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Just after anti-abortionists blocked the three entrances of the complex shortly 
after 8 a.m., police arrested those they identified as the protest's leaders. 
Will Lehman -- founder of Project Rescue, San Diego's version of the national 
anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue -- was among the first arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two hours, protesters sang, prayed and read Scripture while 
police cordoned off the building around them. Around 10 a.m., several paddy 
wagons arrived and officers began to arrest the protesters -- many of whom went 
limp when police confronted them -- by either dragging or leading them to the 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roughness Claimed 
</P>
<P>
Three hours after the demonstration began, police had cleared the entrances to 
the building, but not before some protesters claimed they had been roughly 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, who was taken to San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, said 
from the hospital that he momentarily passed out after a chokehold and inhaled 
his vomit when he began to throw up in the police car. He said he also suffered 
from back and neck pain as a result of his arrest. A hospital spokeswoman said 
Saturday night that Lehman had been treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Mick McCoy, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in El Cajon, said 
Saturday night that "We were saddened over the use of excessive force in the 
arrests. Pain and personal injury were inflicted upon peaceful, nonviolent 
citizens who were not resisting arrest." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy argued that even some of those who complied with officers' orders were 
treated badly. "In fact, many that were walking as ordered continued to have 
pain-compliance holds used even after they were already injured," he said. 
McCoy said five demonstrators went to area hospitals with wrist and arm 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defended Tactics 
</P>
<P>
But police spokesman Dave Cohen defended the tactics, saying officers used 
"pain compliance" measures to get the blockade of anti-abortionists to move. 
</P>
<P>
"You get somebody to move by applying pressure at the right spot," he said. 
"It's extremely painful, and it's taught . . . as a pain-compliance point. 
There is no permanent damage but, yes, it's painful." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice advocates applauded the way police handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," said Betty Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil 
Liberties Union Foundation for San Diego and Imperial Counties. "Police 
response was very effective and very prompt. Some patients were in before 
(Project Rescue) arrived, the police were able to get the other patients in by 
10 o'clock, and that's what's important. They (Project Rescue) have to chalk 
this up as a complete failure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eve of March 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came on the eve of a march today in Washington billed as the 
largest demonstration ever in favor of abortion rights. Thousands of pro-choice 
activists, including Hollywood stars, have descended on the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's protest came after a series of larger ones in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties two weeks ago that climaxed March 25 with the arrests of more than 700 
anti-abortion activists blockading a Los Angeles clinic. Three weeks ago 
Project Rescue demonstrated in front of a doctor's office in Escondido, but 
police there made no arrests. 
</P>

Cohen said that the vast majority of the protesters Saturday will face 
misdemeanor trespassing and illegal assembly charges but that eight were 
arrested in connection with conspiracy. Felony charges can be brought for 
conspiracy against anyone who urges people to break the law, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in any way taking sides, but if they are keeping people from getting 
in, that is a violation of the law," he said, adding that Lehman will be 
charged in connection with felony conspiracy for his role in the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Go to Jail 
</P>
<P>
Project Rescue participants have expressed their willingness to go to jail in 
their crusade to "rescue" unborn children. Operation Rescue counts about 23,000 
sympathizers who have been arrested for similar actions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The number of demonstrators Saturday was significantly lower than the more than 
300 that shut down the office of Dr. Ying Chen on March 18 in Escondido. 
Nevertheless, the protesters said they were determined to block the office for 
as long as they could. 
</P>
<P>
"We always could use more, but we're thankful for the ones who are here," said 
Sylvia Sullivan, spokeswoman for Saturday's protest. "It only takes a few to 
block the door," she said shortly before her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
From inside his office, Donald Byrnes, who runs the O-B Medical Group at 3330 
Third Ave., said that to him, the protest was "incredible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Middle-Aged Men 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the pro-life people happen to be middle-aged men who should have 
nothing to do with a woman's choice," he said. "They don't want to take care of 
(the children). So what happens? The child becomes a millstone around society's 
neck." 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes said that his office is not usually open on Saturdays, but within the 
past year he has occasionally been open. "We're not going to be dissuaded; 
we're not doing anything here that we're ashamed of. . . . Nobody enjoys 
undergoing an abortion, but it's important that women be able to have that 
choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the protesters arrived at the office about 8 a.m., employees and 
seven patients had already entered the building, said Betty Dempsey, an 
administrator of the office and wife of Byrnes. 
</P>
<P>
"They got here by 7:30 a.m.," Dempsey said. "We were fully aware that this 
might happen." She added that some of the 24 patients scheduled for 
appointments Saturday called and said they would reschedule. Not all of the 
patients were scheduled for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready for Protest 
</P>
<P>
Laura Byrnes, 23, daughter of Donald Byrnes, said that her father was ready for 
the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew all about this. They were here obviously during the week. I noticed a 
man in a truck who looked like he was a building inspector or something and I 
didn't think anything of it, until he drove away and I saw a bumper sticker 
that said, 'Abortion is murder.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly they have a right to be here. They think they are protecting the 
rights of children, but the same rights that allow them to be here are the same 
rights that allow abortion. . . . If you limit a woman's rights to do what she 
wants with her body, where does it stop? Individuals are the only ones who know 
what's right for them," Laura Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortionists weren't the only ones demonstrating in front of the building 
Saturday. Across the street from where anti-abortionists were peacefully 
congregating, pro-choice advocates chanted slogans such as, "Hey, hey, ho, ho; 
Project Rescue has got to go," and "No more coat hangers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Screamed 
</P>
<P>
One by one, protesters were arrested, some screaming and complaining of pain. 
</P>
<P>
"You are proving nothing," one officer told a protester as he held a handful of 
his hair. Police repeatedly told protesters, many of whom went limp before 
being arrested, "Stand up and walk and it won't hurt. The pain goes away if you 
stand up." 
</P>
<P>
In Byrne's waiting room, two anti-abortionists, who had scheduled a phony 
abortion with Byrne, talked with patients about their decision until Dempsey 
ordered them out of the office. "You have no business talking to our patients," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Mullen, a Project Rescue participant, told the patients before she left, 
"This is a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life. These 
are real babies." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the office, Mullen, a single mother, said that the women weren't given 
options they need to be able to make a reasonable decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to be told what they're doing. Five to 10 years from now, they'll 
suffer from post-abortion depression," she said. "I've been on both sides. I've 
been told I couldn't have a child. 'How would I take care of him?' they said. 
But I have been able to. So it's postponed my life a little; I just don't 
believe there's such a thing as an unwanted child."

WEEKLY PAPERS: GETTING A READ ON STATE OF THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FEINSILBER, Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Texas teen-ager getting ready for the Junior Livestock Show had some thoughts 
about petulant porkers. 
</P>
<P>
"Raising a pig is good fun, but how much fun depends on the mood of the pig," 
Jenny Haley told the Anvil Herald in Hondo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
In West Virginia, a woman egged on by a granddaughter-in-law, finally got 
around to earning a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"I dreaded math the most," Dorothy Johns, 71, of Gay, W. Va., told her local 
paper, the Ravenswood News. 
</P>
<P>
When the 91-year-old founder of an egg and poultry company in Electra, Tex., 
died, his obituary in the San Saba (Texas) News matter-of-factly noted that he 
was born in Indian territory and as a child was brought across the Red River in 
a covered wagon. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bonners Ferry Herald, which has served Boundary County, Ida., since 
1891, columnist Grace Bauman offered this observation: "If you think you're 
getting too much government, just be thankful you're not getting as much as 
you're paying for." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Warning About Rabies 
</P>
<P>
A headline in the Meade County Messenger of Brandenburg, Ky.: "Rabies Cases 
Fewer, but Stay Alert." 
</P>
<P>
So it goes in the countryside. While Washington concerned itself with 
savings-and-loan insolvency and the social habits of John Tower, the topic of 
the Tri-State Cow-Calf Symposium at Haigler, Neb. was closer to home: 
"Producing the Cow of the Future Today." 
</P>
<P>
There are things to be learned about the state of the nation from America's 
7,500 weekly newspapers that cannot be found in the Congressional Record. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is also some bad news: 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers of Clinton County, Mo., may be stuck with the $20,000 medical 
bill of a jail escapee who suffered frostbite while at large and had to have 
both legs amputated, the Lawson Review reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Osawatomie (Kansas) Graphic worries that Osawatomie's reputation as a 
railroad town may be slipping; the Union Pacific is thinking about routing 
fewer trains through town. 
</P>
<P>
Drug problems are a worry in the country, as in the big cities. Schools get 
consolidated, young people leave town and factories close. The drought of 1988 
is not over yet. There is still not enough rain in many regions, not enough 
snow cover for winter wheat crops. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunters are finding fewer rabbits and quail than usual in Kentucky this 
season," the Bath County News-Outlook of Owingsville reported. Blame the 
drought, said Jeff Sole of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News From Back Home 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the weeklies report news that tells you that the heart of America 
is still ticking. It is important news, because, after all, doesn't everyone 
come from a small town -- or think one did, or wish one had? 
</P>
<P>
Here is some of the news from back home: 
</P>
<P>
Wallace Wyatt Jr. promised that if he were elected probate judge of St. Clair 
County, Ala., he would eat a super-hot barbecue sandwich at Smitty's Barb-B-Que 
in Odenville. He was, and he did. "He said he wouldn't do it again for $500, 
and it wasn't something he'd wish on anyone, even a Republican," the St. Clair 
News-Aegis reported. 
</P>
<P>
While working on a master's degree, Melanie Reid of Due West, S. C., looked 
into the history of the Opera House that opened in Abbeville in 1908 and put 
the lie to some local legends. There is no evidence at all, she told the 
Abbeville Press and Banner, that Jimmy Durante, Sarah Bernhardt or the 
Ziegfield Follies ever performed there. 
</P>
<P>
In Oconomowoc, Wis., high school football player Rich Andrus was recruited by 
the University of Wisconsin. Head coach Don Morton and an assistant called on 
him on the first day home visits were permitted. Exactly when did they arrive? 
"Twelve-oh-one a.m.," Andrus told the Oconomowoc Enterprise. He said their 
tenacity was "pretty impressive." 
</P>
<P>
The Enterprise also reported that people from the Oconomowoc area drove in four 
trucks for 4 1/2 hours to deliver food, clothes and paper products to northern 
Wisconsin farmers still suffering from the effects of last summer's drought. 
The farm families need work clothes, said Mrs. Gerhart Tetzlaff of Stone Bank, 
but they especially need food. "I think they are so hungry they don't care 
about clothes." 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Club of Stamford, Tex., celebrated the state's 100th Arbor Day by 
planting two pecan trees on the west side of Post Office Square as a memorial 
to Mrs. A. C. Denson, a longtime member of the club "who, had she lived another 
month, would also have been 100 years old," the Stamford American said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Deputy's Deposition 
</P>
<P>
Glenn R. and Anne Jane Eutsey of Scottdale, Pa., celebrated their 50th wedding 
anniversary with 46 relatives at a dinner given at their home by their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ernie Booth was assigned to parts of Millard, Juab and Beaver counties 
in Utah's western desert -- what Millard County Sheriff Ed Phillips called "the 
largest beat in the United States" an area of -- 3,000 square miles. Almost 
triple the size of Rhode Island, it has about 600 residents. Booth told the 
Millard County Chronicle Progress: "Basically, I'm pretty well qualified. I can 
ride a horse dang near anywhere. I rodeo a lot. I still ride bulls occasionally 
and I've team-roped. I know cattle." 
</P>
<P>
The Area Chamber of Commerce of Yale, Mich., decided to hold a festival in July 
to honor the town's most famous product, bologna. Among the activities will be 
a pet parade, a dog show and selection of a King and Queen of Bologna, the Yale 
Expositor reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Harrah, Okla., the Town Board discussed the number of animals that Casey 
Rychlec keeps on his property -- 48 by one count, including geese, ducks, 
chickens, guinea fowl, turkeys, pigeons and dogs. The Harrah News referred to 
the collection as a "menagerie" and said neighbors are disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Carl Rooks Day' 
</P>
<P>
From the Bowdon (Georgia) Bulletin: "At Bowdon Elementary School, teacher 
Sylvia Caldwell asked her seventh-graders why Friday was such an important day 
to all Americans. Though it was also Inauguration Day, and that was the answer 
she was looking for, student Andy Boatright quickly responded: "It's Carl Rooks 
Day." He was right. Carl Rooks had retired as police chief. In an interview 
with the Bulletin, Rooks said that in 24 years in law enforcement, he had never 
had to shoot anyone. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Bulletin of Fayetteville, N. Y., described one recent Friday this 
way: "That was the kind of day you could separate the feeble defrosters from 
the strong." 
</P>
<P>
The newsmaker in the resort town of Whitefish, Mont., was Police Chief Dave 
Dolson. He told the city council that Whitefish was becoming the "drug capital 
of northwest Montana." Out-of-town newspapers picked up the story and local 
business people were irked, the Whitefish Pilot said. Bar owners were 
especially angry because of Dolson's reference to "people inhaling lines of 
cocaine off the bars and card tables in our town." 
</P>
<P>
The Friend (Nebraska) Sentinel, reported on an opossum's night visit to Marie 
French's porch on Chestnut Street. She took some photographs to prove it, and 
the Sentinel published two of them. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinel also reported that Brian Wienke of Indicott, Neb., has been 
planting turnips for fall and winter forage for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The cows love the turnips once they discover them," Wienke said. "They will 
walk through milo stubble and winter wheat to get to the turnips." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Barnes defeated Stephanie Franks for the title of the best speller in 
Itawamba County, Miss. He did so, the Itawamba County Times said, by correctly 
spelling "khaki" and "separation" and won a prize of $84. Stephanie won $25. 
</P>
<P>
In his column in the Waupun (Wis.) Leaders News, public librarian Tom Green 
noted that 6,316 borrowers checked out 108,549 items in 1988, and that fines 
totaling $3,108.80 were turned over to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Postmaster Rhonda Wallace advised residents of Hominy, Okla., to keep their 
mailboxes in good shape. "An old dented box with sharp cutting edges or a box 
that is too small should be replaced or mail delivery may be withheld," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Litterbugs Exposed 
</P>
<P>
The Manchester-Coffee County Beautification Assn. of Tennessee established a 
Litter Hotline so that tipsters could report the license numbers of drivers 
seen tossing trash from their vehicles. People who are informed on get a 
warning letter and a litter bag in the mail, the Tullahoma (Tennessee) News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the editor of the Horton (Kansas) Headlight, Donna Hoffman 
protested a proposal, discussed by the commissioners, that stray cats be 
destroyed. She wrote that the cats help control mice and rats. "Imagine what it 
would be like with no cats to catch and kill these rodents! What's next? A rat 
ordinance?" 
</P>
<P>
The conditions of the restrooms at Duran Junior High School came up at a 
meeting of the board of education in Pell City, Ala. The problems -- 
overcrowding, a lack of privacy and urinals installed so high that boys 
couldn't use them. 
</P>
<P>
One angry father said he understood that if a boy was tardy because he had to 
wait to use the restroom he might get a paddling when he finally reached class. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Clair News-Aegis quoted the father as saying: "I'll tell you this, if 
my child comes home and says he got a paddling because he was held up in the 
bathroom, I'm going to come here and see some folks."

CHILD KILLER SITS BEHIND BARS -- AWAITING HER WEDDING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

CLINTON, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted child killer Elizabeth Diane Downs, who describes herself as the most 
hated woman in America, giggles nervously as she talks of her plans to marry a 
former police officer from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old former mail carrier, one of Oregon's most notorious criminals 
of modern times, also smiles a lot when she talks of a new book, due out this 
spring, about her trial. 
</P>
<P>
Downs was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years for killing her 7-year-old 
daughter and wounding her two other children on a rural road outside 
Springfield, Ore., on May 19, 1983. An appeal of the conviction was set aside 
without comment on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scaled Prison Fence 
</P>
<P>
She was transferred to the Correctional Institution for Women in New Jersey 
after she escaped in July, 1987, by scaling a fence at the Oregon Women's 
Correctional Center in Salem. She remained at large for 10 days until she was 
found with a group of men less than a mile from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prison authorities believe she has less chance of escaping in New Jersey 
because she doesn't know anybody here and would have no place to run. 
</P>
<P>
Prison guards at Clinton say Downs keeps to herself, but associates say she 
thrives on publicity. As one guard put it: "The last thing her ego needs is 
another interview." 
</P>
<P>
"She sees a camera and her whole world brightens," says Ann Rule, a 
Seattle-based author whose book, "Small Sacrifices," about the Downs case rode 
the best-seller list of the New York Times for 25 weeks last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe she has any emotion for her children beyond the fact that 
they're her possession and somebody took them away from her." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that the children were shot because Downs believed they 
interfered in her relationship with a boyfriend who did not want to be a 
father. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Stranger 
</P>
<P>
Downs contends that a stranger flagged down her car and shot her and the 
children. She was wounded by a single bullet in the left arm. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened the night of the shooting was so horrendous, so unexpected, so 
unbelievable," Downs said in a recent jailhouse interview. "I'm very 
self-disciplined and I need to have control of my own existence. I just reached 
a point of not knowing what was real and what wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Lynn Downs, 7, was killed. Fourteen year-old Christie Ann was left with 
speech impairment, and 9-year-old Danny is paralyzed from the waist down. The 
lead prosecutor in the case, Lane County Assistant Dist. Atty. Fred Hugi, 
adopted the children. 
</P>
<P>
Downs says she spends her time exchanging letters with her new fiance, whom she 
described as a former police officer who saw her on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" 
and wrote her because he felt sorry for her. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who would want to be involved with the most hated woman in America 
must be a nut," Downs says. "But he's not a wacko. He's genuine." 
</P>
<P>
She declines to identify the man except that he is a former Oregon police 
officer who has since moved to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucid. I've been married before and I said I never would do it again. But 
I'm in love," says Downs, who was married for eight years to Steve Downs, an 
electrician and farm laborer. 
</P>
<P>
Kim White, a state Corrections Department spokeswoman, confirmed that Downs has 
asked the department for permission to marry the man. White also would not 
identify him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Permission to Marry 
</P>
<P>
She said the couple are in the preliminary stages of applying for permission to 
marry. They still must meet with the prison chaplain and obtain the approval of 
the superintendent who submits the request to a committee for a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey does not permit conjugal visits, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Downs, who earned an associate's degree in general studies while imprisoned in 
Oregon, has also completed a book, "Best-Kept Secrets," scheduled for release 
this month by Danmark Publishing, of Springfield, Ore. About 75% of the 
350-page book will be direct quotes from the trial transcript, Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Danmark says that any profits from the book will go to the 
state of Oregon under a law passed in the wake of the Downs case. 
</P>
<P>
Its release surely will spark more discussion of the case, but Downs says she 
doesn't believe her children will suffer if people talk about her case. 
</P>
<P>
"How could the truth hurt the kids?" Downs says. "I get so frustrated when I 
hear things like that. . . . How can the truth hurt anybody unless they're a 
liar?" 
</P>
<P>
But Rule says the truth that she observed in the nine-month trial was a guilty 
Downs, who was pregnant at the time with a child who was subsequently put up 
for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Manipulative' 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anyone as manipulative as Diane," Rule says, describing her as 
"sociopathic, histrionic and narcissistic." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she knows what she did," Rule says. "The truth is buried so deep that 
she doesn't have to think about it. She's not crazy though." 
</P>
<P>
But Downs denies her guilt and says the bonds between her and her children 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
"They're part of my body that broke away," she says. "They love me, but at the 
same time they're uncomfortable with ever being with me again."

THAIS PLACE DREAMS, HOPES AT REVERED BANGKOK SHRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BANGKOK, Thailand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a noisy street corner in central Bangkok, Jarassri Jaideang kneels to place 
lotus buds before the image of a Hindu god she says found her a job. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, hundreds of Thais pray for money, love and health at the Erawan 
Shrine, one of the most revered sites of worship in this Buddhist nation. 
Hundreds more give thanks after having their prayers answered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shrine Saved My Life' 
</P>
<P>
"You can say the shrine saved my life," said Jarassri, 28, who came to Bangkok 
from the far northern town of Chiang Rai 10 months ago in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
Like many migrants to the capital, Jarassri found life in Bangkok harsher than 
she had expected. She spent six months looking for full-time work, worrying 
that she would have to return to her family's grocery in Chiang Rai. 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago she went to the shrine on a friend's recommendation. Several 
weeks later she found a job in a small sewing shop, earning $80 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The shrine was built in 1956 after a series of accidents during construction of 
the Erawan Hotel. "Spirit doctors" had a four-faced statue of the Hindu deity 
Brahma erected in a corner of the site and the hotel was completed without 
further delay. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has since been torn down and a modern one is being built on the spot. 
But the shrine will remain, hearing prayers for good school grades, bumper 
harvests, lucrative business deals, good health and lost possessions such as 
books and car keys. 
</P>
<P>
Worship takes concentration. Traditional Thai music and clouds of incense 
compete with the roar and fumes of traffic. As cars speed past the corner, 
drivers often let go of the steering wheel to raise their hands in a quick 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Married couples visit the shrine to ask for children. Love, in various forms, 
is a major topic. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to ask for a happy married life and all the good things it can bring," 
said nurse Noi Chinearap, 21, clutching the hand of the man she married a 
little less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I go every week before I start work to ask for generous men," said Nida 
Chaichum, 18, who said she worked in a bar in a red-light district. 
</P>
<P>
Nida, who came to Bangkok five months ago from a village 400 miles to the 
north, earns $100 a month dancing in a bikini and talking to foreign tourists 
at the club. If the men are generous, she said, she can earn an extra $20 for 
staying a night with them. 
</P>
<P>
Worshipers at the shrine offer flowers, fruit, incense, money and small wooden 
elephants. They also hire traditional dancers to perform before the Brahma and 
gradually cover elephant statues in gold leaf. 
</P>
<P>
Hindu beliefs filtered into Thailand from India before the advent of Buddhism 
more than 2,500 years ago. Erawan was a 33-headed elephant in Hindu mythology. 
</P>
<P>
The shrine's fame has spread through the Chinese societies of Asia, and many 
supplicants come from Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the worshipers are convinced of the shrine's power, however. 
</P>

<P>
'I'd Be Foolish' 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a 50-50 chance that this will do any good, but as long as 
there's a chance I'd be foolish not to take it," said Nopphadol Viwatkamolwat, 
a 19-year-old university student who asked for success in examinations. 
</P>
<P>
The shrine has failed some people. Thirayuth Charoenphaisal, 34, a machine 
operator, asked Brahma four years ago to help him buy a house, after which he 
would look for a wife. 
</P>
<P>
The house cost $20,000 and Thirayuth had scraped together only $8,000. He hoped 
to win the rest in the government lottery, and spent 10% of his monthly salary 
on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Thirayuth did not win and still has not married.

HE TAKES HEAT FOR PHILADELPHIA'S BIG PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR MAYOR GOODE, LITTLE BROTHERLY LOVE 
</P>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's birthplace has big problems, and its mayor, once mentioned as a 
potential vice president, is taking the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphians complain about too few police, dirty streets and reduced 
services. They blame Mayor W. Wilson Goode, whom they have forced to back off 
from a proposed $70-million tax increase. Even a political ally of the mayor 
says he has been "a disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale mentioned Goode as a 
possible running mate in 1984, but that was before the 1985 debacle that 
forever damaged the mayor's image. When police, with Goode's approval, 
confronted the radical MOVE group, 11 people were killed and scores of homes 
were destroyed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Halts Interview 
</P>
<P>
Although Goode has insisted that things in Philadelphia are not as bad as 
critics claim, last week, he abruptly cut off a telephone interview on the 
first question: Is the city in trouble? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about it," he said. "Just say the mayor doesn't want to 
comment." 
</P>
<P>
Challenges remain for Goode, the first black mayor of the nation's 
fifth-largest city, who is nearly halfway through his second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Since he reversed the city's commitment to building a new courthouse and jail 
after $30 million had been spent on it, Goode faces the wrath of the legal 
community and a federal court that has ordered the city to relieve prison 
crowding. Forced by public pressure to back off the tax increase, Goode is 
trying to put together a budget amid projections of a $100-million deficit and 
the clamor for more services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Rebuffs Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Even a special Tax Policy and Budget Review Committee appointed by Goode 
rebuffed the mayor's tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a whitewash and it wasn't. That in itself indicates the 
severity of the problem," said W. Thacher Longstreth, the senior Republican on 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Many say that Goode hasn't been a good manager, and even supporters such as 
Edward Mezvinsky, former Pennsylvania Democratic chairman and co-chairman of 
Goode's 1987 reelection campaign, acknowledge that the mayor is in a political 
bind. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to take unpopular positions because there is a lot less money 
available," Mezvinsky said. "The city has to make it on its own. It's got to 
pull in its belt and cut out unnecessary services. It has to be done if the 
city is going to survive." 
</P>
<P>
At recent town meetings, which Goode arranged this winter in a futile effort to 
sell his tax plan, tempers frequently flared as citizens confronted the 
frustrated, sometimes angry mayor to demand more police, cleaner streets and a 
crackdown on drug dealing in neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ex-Mayor Withholds Comment 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor William Green, under whom Goode was city managing director, would 
not comment on the managerial style of his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts speak for themselves," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Several top Democrats did not return phone calls or refused to comment publicly 
on the mayor's standing. The political ally who called Goode a disappointment 
would speak only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"He really isn't running the city well. He is not a dishonest person and is 
trying to do his best, but integrity isn't enough to manage, and his 
mismanagement has allowed his detractors to have a field day, which has 
undermined his effectiveness," the Goode ally said. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is more divided today than ever before. All the blame isn't Goode's 
alone. Others have to share it, like the council, like the business community, 
the judiciary. Everyone seems to have an ax to grind . . . and Goode has been 
unable to bring the diverse elements together so the city can be run well," the 
ally said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOP Smells Blood 
</P>
<P>
Republicans looking ahead to this fall's district attorney and city controller 
elections smell blood. It's been nearly four decades since Republicans last 
controlled the government of this city, which has a 3-to-1 Democratic 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
"If you listen, you can hear people saying Philadelphia is ready for a complete 
change in government and politics," state Sen. M. Joseph Rocks, the GOP choice 
for controller, said. 
</P>
<P>
Goode has shown he is listening. He said recently he would hire 400 more police 
this year, and then add 300 more in each of the next three years to a force 
that now numbers about 6,000 (down from the 7,800 when he took office in 1984).

DHARMSALA, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young Buddhist monk convulsing under a trance and waving a sword and bow in a 
ritual dance has a say in every important decision of the Tibetan exile 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed as an ancient warrior, he is the chief state oracle of the Tibetans, 
through whom they believe the spirit of the deity Nechung guides their leader, 
the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
Few important decisions are taken by the exiled Dalai Lama and his high 
officials without consulting the oracle, 31-year-old monk Thupten Ngodub. 
</P>
<P>
Until two years ago Ngodub was an ordinary monk living in Dharmsala's Nechung 
Monastery in north India. In March, 1987, he indicated that he had become 14th 
Nechung Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
During special prayers at the Nechung Monastery for the appearance of a 
successor to the 13th oracle, who died in 1984, Ngodub suddenly collapsed in a 
trance. 
</P>
<P>
Tibetans believe he was briefly possessed by the spirit of Nechung, one of two 
deities that are believed to protect Tibetan Buddhism and guard the Dalai Lama, 
who fled Tibet with thousands of his followers 30 years ago after a failed 
uprising against Chinese occupying troops and now leads a campaign for Tibetan 
independence from his exile in Dharmsala. 
</P>
<P>
At least 16 people were killed in February as pro-independence demonstrations 
broke out in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. China then imposed martial law. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not like seeing a person, a spirit in human form. It was more connected 
with a physical experience," Ngodub said during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"At that very moment I felt uneasy and fear originated in my mind and then I 
felt as if I had been shocked by electricity and I slowly lost my memory," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Ngodub could be confirmed as oracle, he was summoned by the Dalai Lama 
to undergo secret tests while in a trance. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his monastery, which has panoramic views across the Himalayan 
foothills to the north Indian plain, he was unable to describe the tests. He 
remembers nothing from his trances. 
</P>
<P>
But he obviously passed. A few months later he was formally enthroned as the 
chief of three state oracles. Ngodub is the only one said to have powers of 
prophesy. 
</P>
<P>
He automatically became abbot of the Nechung Monastery and No. 5 in the 
hierarchy of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
The oracle is consulted about once every two months by the Dalai Lama, the 
Kashag, or exile cabinet, or senior monks, but in most cases his advice remains 
a carefully guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
"His holiness (the Dalai Lama) will ask once or twice a year or sometimes five 
or six. It depends on the circumstances," said the shaven-headed monk with a 
ready smile and a gold watch strapped to his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Ngodub took delight in showing a video recording of one of his oracular 
performances at a recent consultation by lamas at a south Indian monastery. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of possession comes after about half an hour of meditation. His 
chest begins to heave convulsively and his lips draw back from his teeth in a 
grimace. 
</P>
<P>
Already dressed as an ancient warrior in elaborate silk robes of gold and 
green, his attendants swiftly strap a huge gold, silver and silk headdress on 
and help him to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the oracle does a ritual dance, a sword in one hand and a bow in the 
other, before the questions begin. Each is answered in a high pitched sing-song 
voice that one of his attendants helps interpret. 
</P>
<P>
After about five minutes, the trance suddenly ends and Ngodub collapses still 
convulsing. The headdress is ripped off and he is carried away exhausted from 
his performance to rest for at least an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting a shock from electricity," he said through an interpreter. 
"This shock does not go down immediately but after a while I regain my memory." 
</P>
<P>
Some Tibetans are skeptical about the idea of an oracle and believe he plays 
too important a role in Tibetan society, but Ngodub has no doubt that he is 
truly possessed by Nechung.

GAY 'WIDOWER' CHALLENGES DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBER IN N.Y. RENT CONTROL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Miguel Braschi and Leslie Blanchard were regarded by friends as a loving 
couple, their Manhattan apartment the home of "any happily married couple." But 
Braschi faces eviction because their landlord disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
When Blanchard died in Braschi's arms in 1986, Blanchard's name was on the 
lease to the rent-controlled apartment the two men had shared for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the rent control 
laws in New York City's tight and pricey real estate market. Braschi says that 
as a "family member" he should have succession rights even though his name 
wasn't on the lease. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord, Stahl Associates Co., maintains Braschi had no right to the 
desirable apartment because he was not a member of Blanchard's "traditional 
family unit . . . those related by blood, marriage or adoption." 
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense 
Fund, a gay rights group, "The case is about individuals who live in families 
that vary from the Ozzie and Harriet mold." 
</P>
<P>
State court Judge Harold Baer ruled that the men were a family under the 
rent-control law because of "the time, love and commitment given by Braschi to 
Blanchard." Baer halted the eviction, but was overturned on appeal. The Court 
of Appeals, New York's highest court, will hear arguments April 26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remains in Apartment 
</P>
<P>
Braschi is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a question for gay people," Stoddard said. "It's an issue about 
the right of each individual to enter into a non-traditional, non-orthodox 
relationship and be protected by the law." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court must decide whether people in nontraditional living 
arrangements -- homosexuals, unmarried heterosexuals, even elderly couples -- 
have the same protection as married couples and blood relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple couldn't adopt 
the other to keep from being evicted from an apartment that only allowed family 
members to live together. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important case in the country dealing with non-traditional 
family arrangements," Stoddard said. The court's decision could affect 
insurance, hospital visiting rights, inheritance and other areas in which the 
definition of "family" is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard had hired Braschi to manage his exclusive Manhattan beauty salon and 
made him sole beneficiary, leaving him $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exchanged Bracelets 
</P>
<P>
Braschi and Blanchard exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of their 
commitment. Braschi, 33, now wears both. 
</P>
<P>
He cared for Blanchard during the final months of his life and was holding 
Blanchard in his arms when he died in September, 1986. Braschi says he and 
Blanchard "regarded one another . . . as spouses." 
</P>
<P>
"Their friends regarded them as a 'married couple' and their apartment as 'the 
home of any happily married couple,' " according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Stahl Associates has argued that the Legislature never extended succession 
rights to "members of a non-traditional family unit," and has accused Braschi 
of trying to turn the case into a "referendum on homosexual rights." 
</P>
<P>
Braschi's lawyers say Stahl is trying to create that impression "to prejudice 
the atmosphere," and that the case is simply about family rights. 
</P>
<P>
"What this case is about is people's relationships, whether they will be 
protected, based on the strength of the relationship," said Nan Hunter, a 
lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Braschi. 
</P>
<P>
"It (speaks) in terms of family relationships. Family would be not just 
spouses. You're protected under this law if it's your uncle."

MANY SENT BY PARENTS TO SAFETY IN WEST;

YOUNG REFUGEES SEEK HAVEN IN GERMANY

<P>
Not long after Indian occupation troops hung him up by his thumbs in his native 
Sri Lanka, Sivanesweran, a Tamil teen-ager with haunted eyes, says he is 
grateful for refuge in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The youth is one of thousands of refugee children, mostly Sri Lankan and 
Iranian, who escaped war and misery to West Germany after their parents heard 
it requires no visas for travelers under 16, unique among Western nations. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in Sri Lanka and Iran have paid exorbitant sums to shadowy travel 
agents for passports and airline tickets to send their children to West Germany 
to stay until things get better back home, West German border police and social 
workers say. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 children, traveling alone or with others they met on flights, 
swamped Frankfurt international airport in 1988. Even more are expected this 
year -- 319 children arrived in January and 149 in the first week of February. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Persian Gulf war last August, most of the children have 
been Tamils, a religious and ethnic minority in Sri Lankan. But officials now 
anticipate a parade of children fleeing Afghanistan once Soviet troops have 
withdrawn from that war-torn country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right to Seek Asylum 
</P>
<P>
Adult refugees also continue to stream into West Germany, taking advantage of 
the law enshrining the right of foreigners to seek asylum when they show up at 
the border or an airport. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of a record 103,000 in 1988 and an unabated influx so far this year 
has spurred the governing Christian Democrats to propose legislation curbing 
asylum rights. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann vowed last month to seek a visa rule for 
foreigners under 16. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the Bonn government to amend the asylum law magnified after a 
rightist party hostile to foreigners took 7.5% of the vote in a state election 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposed crackdown is opposed by the Christian Democrats' junior 
coalition partner, the liberal Free Democrats. They and opposition parties 
argue that Bonn is bound to preserve the asylum right as atonement for the 
nation's xenophobic Nazi past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housed in Mansion 
</P>
<P>
Once the child refugees are processed through airport customs, they are shunted 
to the Villa Mumm, a former industrialist's 19th-Century mansion on a wooded 
hill in nearby Kronberg. 
</P>
<P>
The stucco, tile-roofed building served as a Nazi Gestapo school before being 
donated to Workers Welfare, a union-linked charity group, after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent visit by a reporter scores of mostly Tamil and Iranian children 
were playing pool in a game room, learning German with texts and notebooks, 
phoning home or just "hanging out" in chatting groups. 
</P>
<P>
But many suffer severe homesickness and nightmares of ordeals back home, even 
after being handed over to relatives or family friends who reside in West 
Germany, said Bernd Jacob, a staff social worker at the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only been here three days. I was held in Indian troop camps five times 
after being rounded up with other young people during hunts for Tamil Tigers 
(guerrillas)," Sivanesweran, the Tamil boy, said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time, they hung me up by my thumbs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bribes to Organizers 
</P>
<P>
After he was freed the fifth time, his parents decided that they could 
guarantee his life only by sending him to West Germany. They sold jewelry and 
other valuables to pay the $2,430, including bribes, demanded by travel 
organizers for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Other Tamil children interviewed had similar stories of brutality in Sri 
Lanka's civil war. Most were waiting to be retrieved by relatives, themselves 
asylum seekers or legal residents in West Germany. A review process by welfare 
workers lasts from several days to several months. 
</P>
<P>
The process was tightened after reports that some children had wound up in 
brothels or fallen into the hands of people trading in human beings, welfare 
staff say. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt Youth Affairs Office, with ultimate responsibility for resettling 
the children, complains of being overwhelmed by a national problem left to be 
handled by a local authority for national political reasons.

MONTANA, FEARFUL OF LOSING HOUSE SEAT, WANTS MORE PEOPLE TO MAKE STATE HOME 
</P>

HELENA, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montana wants YOU. This enormous state is bigger than the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina combined, bigger than all of New England, 
bigger than 60% of the sovereign countries in the United Nations. It has a 
problem of acute disproportion: too much land, too few people. 
</P>
<P>
Montana is facing what Gov. Stan Stephens, a Republican, calls "a terrible 
thought." The state is dangerously close to losing one of its two seats in the 
House of Representatives in the national reapportionment that will follow the 
1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, Montana will have just enough people to keep two House 
members, but Census Bureau projections say that, under the complicated 
congressional formula, the state will fall about 12,000 people short of 
qualifying for a second House seat even though it is believed to have about 
805,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
With America's 20th head count scheduled to begin one year from today, Montana 
has little time to fend off disaster. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. Marc Racicot said he already is contemplating legal action if 
the census numbers are disappointing. Some legislators have suggested in jest 
-- well, half in jest -- that this would be a perfect time for Montanans to 
have more children. More seriously, Montanans have been making public appeals, 
inviting people elsewhere to move here by next April and beef up the census 
count. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens is not entirely comfortable with these efforts. "I get letters from 
people in Texas, Alaska, who knows where," the amiable, plain-spoken governor 
said. "They say they hear Montana needs people, and they'll come here, you 
know, if I guarantee them a job. Well, of course I can't." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Stephens said, it would be wonderful if enough people would 
move in. In an interview, he asked that newspaper readers be advised that "they 
would fall in love with this place in a minute if they came out here." 
</P>
<P>
Montana is not the only state likely to lose a House seat. This kind of 
reshuffling happens after every census, when the House is reapportioned. Each 
state is guaranteed one House member. Seats 51 through 435 are allotted on the 
basis of state population, 435 seats being the maximum fixed by law. 
</P>
<P>
Six other states have only one representative in the House, but Montana would 
be the most populous single House district by far. After 1990, the average 
ratio of residents to House members will be about 540,000 to 1; Montana's would 
be 800,000 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The constituency is scattered here. Alaska, another single-seat state, is 
bigger than Montana but the vast majority of its 400,000 people live in the 
narrow Anchorage-Juneau corridor. Montanans are spread out fairly evenly over 
150,000 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Even more worrisome to Stephens and other local leaders is the thought of a 
lower political profile for a state that already feels nearly invisible. 
</P>
<P>
"South of Denver or east of Minneapolis," Stephens said, "you mention Montana, 
and you can see their eyes glaze over . . . . I go back to Washington, and 
they're not even sure where Montana is." 
</P>
<P>
Montana lies between the high plains of the upper Midwest farm belt and the 
timberlands of the mountainous Northwest. In an increasingly urban and suburban 
nation, Montana remains a bastion of small-town America. Billings, the largest 
urban center, has 66,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the immediate vicinity of a lead or copper smelter, the country is an 
environmentalist's heaven, largely unsullied by traffic or industry, noise or 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
At least two Montanans have a personal concern about reapportionment: Reps. Pat 
Williams, a Democrat from the traditionally liberal western end of the state, 
and Ron Marlenee, a Republican from the conservative farm country in the east.

Assistant Agriculture Secretary Ewen Wilson, one of the Agriculture 
Department's top economics officers for four years, said Friday he will leave 
government May 6 to seek private employment. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson joined the department in 1985 as deputy assistant secretary for 
economics and moved into his current post in 1987. In a letter to Agriculture 
Secretary Clayton Yeutter, he said Friday, "The time has come to move on." 
</P>
<P>
The decision means Yeutter will have few, if any, holdovers from the Reagan 
era. President Bush has named new people for deputy secretary, undersecretary 
for commodity programs and for four assistant posts. There are four other 
sub-Cabinet posts; Wilson holds one of them. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication of who will be chosen to replace Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, he said that after four years at the department and with a 
major transition occurring, "it seemed like the right time" to change jobs.

LOS ALAMOS, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jennifer Fleming died after a car crash early on New Year's Day, 1988, it 
changed the way Los Alamos looked at alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally just not cool to drink and drive anymore," said Los Alamos County 
youth coordinator Peggy Vigil. Students "see those who drink and drive as the 
enemy. They saw public outrage, perhaps you could say community anger." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer, 16, a Los Alamos High School junior, was fatally injured while 
driving around to help sober up a friend who'd been drinking. She had spent the 
evening at an alcohol-free dance she had helped organize. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struck by a Pickup 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go home at the time because I was afraid my parents would 
find out," said Laura Root, who was with Jennifer and two friends when a pickup 
swerved to avoid a stopped car and crushed Jennifer's car. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the accident, I was on a crash course," Laura said. "I was doing 
things. I was lying to my parents. I was totally out of control. I guess for me 
it took one of my best friends dying to realize I couldn't live that way any 
more. It wasn't worth it. It just wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
She lost 12 teeth, suffered a bruised spinal cord and a crushed knee that had 
metal from the wreckage embedded in it. "They're still reconstructing my mouth. 
Sometime this summer they should be done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suffers Multiple Injuries 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bussolini permanently lost all but peripheral vision in his left eye and 
suffered a broken hip, arm and more than 20 facial fractures. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Van Dyck had fractures of the foot, arm, ribs, hand and face and a 
punctured lung. She still feels pain more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
After they got out of the hospital, Jeff, Stephanie and Laura helped start a 
chapter of Students Against Driving Drunk. The 20 members sponsored an 
alcohol-free St. Patrick's Day dance this year. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Vigil said she has seen a change in "how the kids perceive and treat 
their peers who drink and drive." There has been a 42% decrease in driving 
while intoxicated (DWI) arrests since 1986, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Laws Passed 
</P>
<P>
The biggest decline came after the crash, said Police Chief Alan Kirk. "The 
last year in Los Alamos there's been a tremendous publicity campaign by various 
organizations in the community to bring attention to the drunk driving problem. 
The County Council passed several laws the past year which also deal with drunk 
driving violations." 
</P>
<P>
These include extending a ban on open containers to passengers, a mandatory 30 
days in jail for a third offense, 15 days for driving on a DWI-revoked license, 
and two days if breath alcohol is 0.15% or higher. (The legal limit for DWI 
remains 0.10.) 
</P>
<P>
Police also have added roadblocks and have been speaking at schools and civic 
organizations, Kirk said. Jennifer's death "definitely impacted the community. 
It was tremendous just as far as the publicity aspect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Need to Be Careful' 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to parties anymore, the discussion is: 'We need to be careful and 
not become intoxicated to drive home or there may be a roadblock,' and I think 
that has caused people to drink less." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, pickup driver Jack Kerns' views have changed. Kerns, 31, who admits 
he had been drinking but denies he was drunk, was accused of driving while 
intoxicated and without a license (revoked for a previous DWI). He is serving 7 
1/2 years in Los Lunas Correctional Facility for vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody regrets what happened more than I do," Kerns said, adding that when he 
gets out of prison he hopes to be an alcohol counseler. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer's mother, Marion Fleming, who is founding a chapter of Mothers Against 
Drunk Drivers in Los Alamos, issued a plea to people who think they are 
sufficiently in control to drink and drive. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had any idea what it's like to go through something like this, they 
would never take the risk," she said.

COMMUNISTS RUN SHADOW GOVERNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
REBELS ACTIVE IN TOWN NAMED MARCOS 
</P>

MARCOS, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communist rebels have established a shadow government and are collecting taxes 
in this northern town named for the family of Ferdinand E. Marcos -- a fierce 
anti-Communist during his 20-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
Local military and civilian officials say this town of 12,000 people that is 
230 miles north of Manila became a rebel stronghold after the former president 
fled to Hawaii in the 1986 military-civilian uprising that propelled Corazon 
Aquino to power. 
</P>
<P>
"In the time of Marcos, they were only in the mountains," Mayor Felicito Tamayo 
said of the rebel New People's Army. "Now they have been able to reverse that. 
It's as if the timing was great -- Communists entering and Marcos leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos town is about 10 miles south of Sarrat, where the former president was 
born 71 years ago. The town's 13 outlying hamlets, mostly named for members of 
Marcos' family, have become gateways for guerrillas to slip down from the 
mountains into populous areas of Ilocos Norte province. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebels 'Just Pass Through' 
</P>
<P>
"They just pass through," said Melecio Duldulao, 45, chief of the hamlet of 
Imelda, named for Marcos' wife. "Occasionally, when they come at lunchtime, we 
ask them to join us. But that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Tamayo said the rebels have killed civilians, seized private property for their 
"revolutionary agrarian reform" and have forced businesses to pay protection 
money, or what they call "revolutionary taxes." 
</P>
<P>
On March 1, army troops raided a 14-acre rebel training camp less than 2 miles 
from the town. The camp, which was abandoned, contained obstacle courses and a 
makeshift clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Tamayo said the rebel activity has created a climate of fear in the town that 
civilian and military officials appear powerless to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"By 6 p.m., you should have already eaten and gone home," Tamayo said. "Then 
make sure all the windows are closed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Try to Stay Neutral 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople say they try to remain neutral in the conflict but find themselves 
increasingly drawn into the cycle of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Cory arrived and the New People's Army arrived," said Helen Abrigado, wife of 
a town official. "We are really having a hard time. We are afraid. If we see 
the (rebels), we get scared. When we see the military we also get scared." 
</P>
<P>
Duldulao said the rebels began infiltrating his hamlet, about a mile east of 
the town center, in 1984. Four years later, they killed Artemio Manguma, leader 
of the village security volunteers and a suspected military informant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, rebels tied up Duldulao in front of his eight children 
but released him after his wife, Milagros, persuaded them that he had no links 
to the military. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collect Taxes 
</P>
<P>
"They have organized in the (village) level," said Brig. Gen. Bayani Fabic, 
northern Luzon commander. "They have organized economic committees and are 
already collecting taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The army's 45th Infantry Battalion operates in the area, and Fabic has stepped 
up intelligence-gathering operations against the shadow governments, which he 
considers the principal threat. 
</P>
<P>
"To us, the armed component is easy to control," Fabic said, referring to armed 
guerrillas. "But to uproot the political structure of the shadow government, 
that is a very tedious process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mediating Role for Church 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Rock Bonoan, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic archdiocese, said the 
church plays a leading role in mediating between the military and the rebels. 
He said priests often must defend parishioners accused by the military of 
sympathizing with the rebels, whose insurgency is 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are victims in this war," Bonoan said. "People are branded 
Communist rebels even before they become one." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, gunmen who Bonoan said were believed to be soldiers massacred a 
family of five in the nearby town of Vintar.

AFTER TWO YEARS OF HEADY GROWTH, COMPUTER FIRMS HAVE HIT HARD TIMES, WITH NO 
RELIEF IN SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first inkling of bad news came last August from W. Jerry Sanders, chairman 
of Advanced Micro Devices. In a pronouncement reminiscent of Chicken Little's 
"the sky is falling," the flamboyant high-tech entrepreneur said an abrupt 
slowdown in semiconductor orders from personal computer manufacturers signaled 
nothing less than a downturn for the entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' predictions were immediately dismissed as preposterous and hysterical. 
Few in the computer industry wanted to hear, let alone believe, that the future 
could be any less glorious than the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanders has proven to be remarkably prescient. Not since the severe slump 
of 1985-86 has the computer industry been hit with such a stream of plant 
closings, large-scale employee layoffs, evaporating profits and disappointing 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
And crystal ball gazers are finding few reasons to be any more hopeful about 
the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, we are looking at a slowdown," said Robert Charlton, an 
analyst with Dataquest, a high-tech market research firm. "All companies are 
going to feel some effects." 
</P>
<P>
In the last six months, chip makers National Semiconductor and Intel, computer 
manufacturers ranging from IBM and Apple Computer to low-end clone-maker 
Leading Edge and software publishers such as Microsoft all have reported 
financial setbacks. Unisys became the latest to chime in when it said late last 
month that it expects to post a loss of up to $80 million due to an 
"aberration" in its business operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although many industry executives still argue that these developments reflect 
problems at individual companies rather than an industrywide slump, a rising 
chorus of analysts is beginning to suggest otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Their assessment: The market for computers and related office automation 
systems, which enjoyed explosive growth for the last two years, is now 
expanding more slowly because of creeping inflation, worries about the economy 
among corporate purchasing managers and a natural pause in buying while 
software programmers and customers alike catch up with the latest technology 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Preston, a personal computer market analyst with Salomon Bros. in New 
York, sees some striking similarities between the current climate and that of 
1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
As in the previous slowdown, Preston noted, the industry is coming off a 
tremendous boom that lured scores of new companies and products into the 
market. Not surprisingly, she added, "We now have too many companies again and 
there is another shakeout under way. The plain fact is that there are some 
companies that aren't going to be around for much longer." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Leading Edge has filed for bankruptcy protection. And last week Wyse 
Technology revealed that its lenders agreed to waive some their loan 
requirements because the company's recent losses have eroded its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem for some companies are earlier-laid plans to launch new 
products into what they thought would be a red-hot market. Despite the cooling, 
the product introductions continue at a boggling rate, in large part, analysts 
say, because companies want to protect their market shares and technology 
know-how. In the last two months alone, virtually every major computer 
manufacturer has introduced new products, ranging from entirely new systems to 
relatively unexciting product upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market research 
firm, predicts that sales of all types of computers in the United States will 
grow by just 3% this year, compared to 7% last year. The Commerce Department 
also is predicting slower growth. Commerce, however, is predicting a 10% 
increase in U.S. computer industry shipments this year, to about $67 billion, 
compared to a 14% increase in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even though sales continue to rise, analysts say the slower growth rate means 
that companies can't get away with some of the missteps they could in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two years have been boom times," said Stewart Alsop, publisher of a 
personal computer newsletter in the Silicon Valley. "A lot of sins were hidden 
by that." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the slowdown, which has invaded most segments of the computer industry, 
has been most apparent in the personal computer market. Analysts say the 
industry's relative immaturity and heavy competition, as well as rapid advances 
that quickly make products obsolete, make PCs among the most vulnerable segment 
of the technology market when consumers' purse strings suddenly tighten. 
</P>
<P>
Another important influence is the growing supply of low-cost PCs imported from 
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. These systems are competing head-on with 
comparable machines produced by several U.S. companies, notably Wyse 
Technology, AST Research and Dell Computer. 
</P>
<P>
When the entire market was rapidly expanding, the additional competition wasn't 
so troublesome. But as buying slows, the fighting over market share 
intensifies. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dataquest, PC sales growth in the United States, which has 
averaged more than 25% for the last two years, should remain under 10% for at 
least the next three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
However, as disturbing as the trend might be to those in the industry, 
consumers should be pleased. Price competition, analysts say, has reached a new 
peak, making 1989 one of the best years in recent times to find a personal 
computer bargain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sadder, Wiser 
</P>
<P>
"I would think this would be a very good year to buy," said Dataquest's 
Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, booming demand and a shortage of all-important dynamic random access 
memory chips led several computer makers to raise prices substantially. But 
almost all of them have been forced in recent months to lower prices to pump 
sagging sales. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago we were enthusiastic about our sales prospects and we raised 
prices," said a sadder-but-wiser Thomas Yuen, co-founder and marketing vice 
president at AST Research, the Irvine personal computer maker. "We learned our 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing year, the company has twice cut the prices of its systems. 
Still, it was not enough to repair all the damage. The company laid off 120 
workers earlier this year and announced its first-ever quarterly loss. 
</P>
<P>
AST isn't alone is resorting to layoffs. Advanced Micro Devices recently has 
laid off more than 2,000 workers; National Semiconductor has dropped about 
2,000 employees, and Unisys is eliminating the jobs of 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Even where the price cuts have sparked some increased buying, analysts say they 
do nothing to solve two far more fundamental problems: the ongoing customer 
confusion over competing technologies and the growing gulf between the 
technological capabilities of a computer and the available software to operate 
on the machines. 
</P>
<P>
For example, industry pundits note that Intel's newest and fastest-ever 
microprocessor, the model 80486, will make its debut in personal computers 
later this year. Yet very little software exists today that takes full 
advantage of the technological innovations Intel built into its 80286 chip that 
was released a full five years and two generations of PCs ago. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it will take some exciting new software to draw customers, 
particularly corporate buyers looking to increase office productivity, back 
into the market. They note how the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program spurred 
early sales of the IBM personal computer. And it was the whole new field of 
desktop publishing and related graphics programs that fueled the eventual surge 
in sales of Apple's Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
"They need new software now to create the same kind of customer demand," said 
Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customers Confused 
</P>
<P>
Added Kenneth Flamm, a computer industry analyst for the Brookings Institute: 
"The growth in demand in this industry has always been lumpy, but I think the 
market is now waiting for new technologies. Once they come along, there will be 
a flood of demand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOT DEALS IN A COOL MARKET 
</P>
<P>
It can hardly be considered a fire sale, but prices of many personal computer 
models have dropped steadily in recent months as manufacturers have tried to 
spur sales. The price cuts also reflect the declining prices of dynamic random 
access memory chips, a key memory component that was in short supply last year.

Although declining prices of older model computers have been a regular feature 
of the industry over the years, analysts say the recent price cuts stem in 
large part from softening demand.

RICKENBACKER GUITARS ARE HIP -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1964, the movie theater was showing "A Hard Day's Night," and five young 
Los Angeles rockers strained to read the names on the guitars the Beatles were 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
"George Harrison had a Rickenbacker," recalled Roger McGuinn, who still 
remembers every guitar in the movie. A few days later, McGuinn traded in his 
folk guitar for a gleaming new Rickenbacker electric. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he played it the next year on the Byrds' first hit record. 
</P>
<P>
Long since out of fashion, Rickenbackers are suddenly the rage again. With a 
reputation for expensive quality -- a sort of guitar version of the BMW -- 
they're big with yuppies and with foreign buyers these days. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Beatles, Rickenbacker was just another guitar maker with an unlikely 
home in conservative Orange County. The company -- once an innovator -- became 
too conservative, even stodgy, some critics say. Rickenbacker, they contend, 
wasn't adroit enough to adapt to changes in taste and technology in the 1970s 
and the invasion of foreign-made instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Rickenbacker didn't really seem to care about selling a million guitars or 
becoming a giant like Fender or Gibson, so it has maintained its reputation for 
quality. And, unlike other U.S. guitar makers, it has refused to move its 
manufacturing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
After making guitars for nearly 60 years, Rickenbacker has yet to hit sales of 
$10 million a year, or about what three busy T.G.I. Friday-type restaurants 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
Now the nondescript factory in Santa Ana is swamped with orders for the first 
time since the 1960s, and Rickenbacker is wrestling with problems it hasn't had 
since then: How to make all those guitars without getting sloppy and tarnishing 
its reputation as a small, quality manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
The people who buy Rickenbackers may be dentists and lawyers now, but they were 
adolescents in the 1960s when the Beatles, the Byrds and the Who played 
Rickenbackers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the British rock groups in the '60s used them, and nostalgia's a big 
part of their appeal now," said Richard R. Smith, a guitar collector and author 
of Rickenbacker's official history. 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' sound is so distinct that guitar players can often instantly 
identify one on a record. And even non-experts know there's something different 
about the sharp, scratchy guitar on the first few seconds of the Beatles' 
"Ticket to Ride," or the 12-string guitar that sounds like chimes on the Byrds' 
first hit, "Mr. Tambourine Man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convinced Guitar Was a Fad 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' unusually high, clear, jangly tone also makes them popular now 
with younger bands evoking a 1960s sound. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph Rickenbacker was a Swiss immigrant who patented the first solid-body 
electric guitar in 1935, the forerunner of today's electric guitars. The 
company was named to capitalize on the fame of World War I flying ace Eddie 
Rickenbacker, said to be a distant relative. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Adolph Rickenbacker was ready to retire, he was convinced the 
electric guitar was a fad. He sold the company in 1953 to F. C. Hall, a 
distributor of radio parts who moved it from Los Angeles to be near his home in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, when an obscure young British rocker named John Lennon 
bought one, Rickenbacker was almost as well-known for its older Hawaiian 
guitars, which were played on the guitarist's lap. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Beatles came along, we went from selling thousands of guitars a year 
to tens of thousands," said John Hall, 38, son of F. C. Hall and now 
Rickenbacker's president. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beatles," said Hall, "put the company on the map." 
</P>
<P>
The guitars sold well even though they cost more than $300, by no means cheap 
then. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of the 1960s, the first Rickenbacker boom was over. The Beatles 
had broken up, and most rock had assumed a bluesier, grittier sound. Guitar 
players emerged from anonymity, and every kid wanted the same kind of guitar 
his idol played, or at least one that looked like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried 'Dirtier Sound' 
</P>
<P>
The new stars of the guitar -- such as Eric Clapton -- usually played a Gibson 
Les Paul, which could get the rougher sound. 
</P>
<P>
With Fender's Stratocaster -- played by another innovative musician, Jimi 
Hendrix -- Gibsons were guitars to have in the 1970s. Their sales soared; 
Rickenbacker sales went off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
The company tried to change the guitars, but it was never really able to. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to put in a dirtier sound," said Hall, who bought the company from 
his father four years ago. "It didn't really work." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, things weren't going too well for the rest of the U.S. guitar 
industry, either. Sales of electric and "folk" guitars and other fretted 
instruments had jumped from 400,000 in 1960 -- before folk music and rock hit 
it big -- to 2.5 million in 1972. But the manufacturers would never again sell 
that many. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Well, the baby boomers started to age, and there were fewer teen-agers to 
buy guitars. The late 1970s were rather directionless musically; sales of 
records also suffered. By the 1980s, video games and other distractions 
competed for kids' attention. By 1987, the latest available figures, sales of 
new guitars had dipped to 1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the boom over, but first the Japanese and then the Koreans had 
ridden it right into the U.S. guitar market. 
</P>
<P>
Now guitars manufactured abroad dominate what was once an industry as unique to 
the United States as rock 'n' roll. Of the 1.2 million fretted instruments sold 
last year in the United States, just 123,000 were made in America. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the bigger and more prestigious U.S. companies have moved much of 
their manufacturing offshore to cut costs. Fender, for instance, now makes 40% 
of its guitars abroad, and once quit manufacturing in the United States 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unknowledgeable Executives 
</P>
<P>
Some legendary names in the guitar business got hurt by imports, weak 
management and bad moves. Most had been bought by bigger companies dazzled by 
the glamour of the business. The cash that the new parent companies brought to 
the table sometimes helped soften the blow from imports. But, some critics say, 
the new owners often didn't know much about the business and hadn't the 
faintest idea how to compete with the imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them had a succession of executives who didn't know how to tune a 
guitar," said George Gruhn, a Nashville dealer in vintage guitars who has 
written extensively about the industry. "The Japanese often showed a better 
knowledge of the American market than the Americans did." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for instance, all guitar manufacturers foreign and domestic shipped 
only $328 million worth of guitars at retail in the United States. By contrast, 
computer makers shipped $3.9 billion worth of home computers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Looks 
</P>
<P>
Rickenbacker is small even by the standards of this matchbox-sized industry. 
What saved the company in the 1970s was its basses. As the guitars became 
unfashionable, the basses just as suddenly became hip. They were prized for 
their own bright, clear sound. It lifted the instrument out of the rhythm 
section in some groups -- such as the art rock combo Yes, whose bassist played 
a Rickenbacker -- and made the bass another solo instrument. 
</P>
<P>
When the guitars began to come back a few years ago, it wasn't terribly 
surprising that they still looked pretty much the same as they did 25 years 
ago, since a large part of their appeal is based on nostalgia. And they still 
make the same limited -- though distinct -- range of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia is not cheap: A new Rickenbacker starts at around $500 and goes up to 
$2,700. That's without an amplifier or a case, both essential to the complete 
rock 'n' roller. And it's by no means the most expensive guitar these days. 
</P>
<P>
A Jackson -- a rakish semi-custom guitar often painted in garish reds or blues 
-- starts at $1,500 and goes up to $3,000. It's the guitar of choice for heavy 
metal bands these days. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the heavy metal types, a Rickenbacker is quieter and often older 
professional rockers who tend to play Rickenbackers, such as Tom Petty and 
Jackson Browne. Some newer groups are playing them too, including REM and the 
Bangles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's on MTV? It's Hot 
</P>
<P>
But the guitar market is fickle. Doc Pittillo, a Costa Mesa guitar repairman, 
said, "What's really hot is usually what the kids saw on MTV last week. That's 
why I'm in business." 
</P>
<P>
What happens when the Rickenbacker fad wanes again, as some experts say it 
surely must? 
</P>
<P>
The younger Hall seems more willing to change with the times, to some extent. A 
guitar player, unlike his father, and a friend to some of his more renowned 
customers like McGuinn, Hall has mostly tinkered with a few changes in the 
company's marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Of new models, however, there are few, and critics say the company could get 
caught flat-footed when fashion and technology change again. The last new 
guitars came out four years ago and aren't selling particularly well compared 
to the more classic models because -- in a classic Catch 22 -- the new models 
"don't look like Rickenbackers," said Hall. The company is working on some new 
guitars it will unveil this year. 
</P>
<P>
In marketing its guitars, Rickenbacker has finally deigned to use one of the 
oldest ploys in the guitar industry: Get a famous guitar player to endorse your 
product. But Rickenbacker's pitch is still largely nostalgic: Its deals are 
with older rockers such as the Byrds' McGuinn and Pete Townshend of the Who. 
Rickenbacker is selling new models of the guitars McGuinn and Townshend played 
in the 1960s and making them only in limited editions so it can charge more. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also taken to sticking "Made in America" labels on its guitars. 
That's mostly for foreign buyers. It doesn't really make much difference to the 
U.S. mass market now that guitars from abroad are as good as most U.S. guitars. 
The international market is important to Rickenbacker: Almost half the 10,000 
guitars the company says it usually makes each year are sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a plan to manufacture better and more expensive amplifiers, which 
the company has been making for an indifferent public for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Rickenbacker still sticks stubbornly to a nondescript section of 
Santa Ana -- almost in the shadow of several sparkling new glass office towers 
-- where it employs 100 to make guitars largely by hand. 
</P>
<P>
There are no plans to make the guitars abroad, and Hall says little will change 
at its tiny plant, where blocks of dull, beige Eastern Rock Maple enter only to 
emerge six weeks later as burnished art objects. "My name's not Rickenbacker," 
said Hall, "but I act like it is."

JAMES FLANIGAN: IT TOOK TIME, BUT U.S. STEEL LEARNED LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Pittsburg, Calif., last Thursday, the U.S. Steel division of USX Corp. and 
its partner, Pohang Steel Co. of South Korea, dedicated a parable for our 
times. 
</P>
<P>
With speeches hailing the globalization of industry from USX Chairman David M. 
Roderick and Pohang managing director Young-soo Han, the joint venture known as 
USS-Posco Industries launched a refitted steel mill equipped with the very 
latest in industrial technology. 
</P>
<P>
And there was evident pride among the 1,100 U.S. employees who would work the 
new machines. "There is nothing like this anywhere in the world," said Harold 
Dominguez, who helps oversee a complex of five giant roller machines that press 
steel into thin sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez had been sent to Quangdong, South Korea, to train on the equipment. 
His co-worker Bill Medeiros had been sent to Japan and South Korea. All told, 
150 Pittsburg employees were sent to West Germany, France, Japan and South 
Korea to train on up-to-date equipment -- which told them something about the 
good old U.S.A. "We saw how far behind was the American machinery we were 
working on," says Medeiros. 
</P>
<P>
How, you may ask, did we get to the point where American employees of U.S. 
Steel -- the firm organized by J. P. Morgan himself in 1901 -- had to be sent 
abroad for training so they could work a mill half-owned by a steel company set 
up only 20 years ago by the Korean government? 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburg plant's history can tell you the answer, as well as much else 
about industrial competitiveness -- how things were done in the past and how, 
happily, they'll be done differently in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hurt by Imports 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburg was an old U.S. Steel facility that supplied the fruit and vegetable 
canners, office equipment makers and construction industries of growing 
California -- some of its steel built the Oakland Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1970s, it began to lose out to Japanese steel imports. Soon 
Pittsburg could only make the bottoms and backs of Steelcase desk drawers, 
explains E. A. Roskovensky, who runs the plant today. The mill couldn't supply 
visible parts of a desk because its equipment couldn't produce 
consistent-quality steel, and Steelcase didn't want customers thinking their 
desks were warped. By 1984, when imports had taken 52% of the market, the 
choice of close down or fight back had to be made. Roderick, to his credit, 
opted for battle, signing up Pohang as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies have invested $430 million to outfit the mill with the latest 
in steel-making equipment from Mannesmann of West Germany, Hitachi of Japan and 
others. The plant's computer-controllers are American, from General Electric 
and Honeywell, but the steel equipment is from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because such equipment is no longer made in the United States, the result 
of two decades when other countries kept building or modernizing steel plants, 
but nothing was built here. "In steel, the state of the art is advanced by 
building a new plant and we didn't have the money to build a new plant," says 
U.S. Steel President Thomas Graham. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fell Further Behind 
</P>
<P>
Other countries built steel mills to industrialize their economies, as in South 
Korea, or to provide employment for their citizens, as in Europe. And all 
nations counted on the U.S. market to absorb the resulting surplus, Graham 
explains. U.S. industry didn't make such uneconomic investments, he says, and 
therefore spared American taxpayers the burden of subsidized steel plants that 
foreign taxpayers are now complaining about. 
</P>
<P>
But a price was paid, nonetheless. The U.S. industry refrained from unwise 
expansion, to be sure. But it also neglected modernization of its old plants, 
relying instead on wringing production from outdated equipment and arguing for 
cutbacks in labor costs to become competitive. But such efforts were no match 
for the cost savings and quality improvements achieved by new equipment -- so 
the Americans fell further behind their foreign rivals. 
</P>
<P>
It was a curiously selective investment policy: In years when investment 
bankers and "junk bond" geniuses made millions of dollars from deal-making, 
there was no money to improve productive equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Sins of omission have consequences. The pride and education levels of America's 
work force suffered. If industry keeps working with outdated equipment, there 
is less need for the math and verbal skills that modern computerized machinery 
demands. And grunt labor turning out poor quality steel doesn't command the 
higher pay that goes with productive equipment, either. 
</P>
<P>
Something else has been lost, as well. An industrial base has disappeared, as 
equipment suppliers to heavy industry have gone out of business because there 
were no orders. 
</P>
<P>
Which is untimely because U.S. demand for steel equipment is now rising. 
Capacity has been cut to the point where American steel is profitable and 
imports -- affected by currency shifts -- are losing out. The Pittsburg plant, 
now the low-cost steel supplier in California, will demonstrate that there's a 
payoff to investments in making better steel more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Improvements 
</P>
<P>
And other steelmakers will follow up in years to come, says Chairman Roderick 
of USX. "The American steel industry will pour its profits into plant 
improvements," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Great news, but the curious prospect today is that progress will mean more 
orders for Mannesmann and Hitachi, and more study abroad for U.S. workers -- 
with the whole process, predictably, being hailed as a wondrous example of the 
globalization of industry. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the glass is half full, not half empty: Steel mills and jobs are 
being upgraded, and the pride of the American work force is being restored. But 
somehow there's a nagging question of whether quite so many Americans had to 
suffer before U.S. industry learned some simple lessons.

One of the great moments in my vegetable garden is repeated yearly in the late 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first harvest of green beans, and I eagerly count the days waiting 
for the plants to set sufficient pods for my first green bean feast of the 
season. Cooked until barely tender, with a little salt, butter and pepper, they 
are truly ambrosia; the taste of spring itself. 
</P>
<P>
Green beans, also called snap beans, are the home gardener's second favorite 
vegetable right behind tomatoes. And with good reason; there's simply no 
comparison between the limp product sold in the supermarket and its fresh 
counterpart from the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Give green beans the snap test. A truly fresh green bean will snap in two with 
aplomb and with a spurt of juice, while its supermarket cousin will bend 
considerably before breaking. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to green beans, the home gardener can grow an array of other beans, 
including fresh lima beans, which are almost impossible to find at the market. 
Here is a rundown of some of the beans that will produce well locally. 
</P>
<P>
GREEN BEANS: Being easy to grow and providing a bountiful harvest are just two 
of the reasons behind the popularity of green beans. 
</P>
<P>
Green beans used to be known as string beans. However, plant breeders have made 
the modern varieties stringless. Green beans are divided into two types, the 
bush varieties and the pole varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Bush-type green beans are the easiest and earliest to grow, but pole beans are 
more productive, and you might include both in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite variety among home gardeners is still the old-time Kentucky 
Wonder. I prefer the Blue Lake, as it is earlier, more productive and of higher 
quality. Pole green beans require about 65 days from planting to reach 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Bush green beans are earlier than pole beans, but require more space to get the 
same yield. Rows of bush beans should be planted at two-week intervals to 
assure continuous production. 
</P>
<P>
Good varieties of bush snap beans include Bush Blue Lake, Tenderpod, Venture 
and Tendercrop. 
</P>
<P>
Gourmet cooks may want to try their hand at growing French filet (haricot vert) 
beans, those ultra slender green beans utilized in classic French cooking. The 
seeds are becoming more available in this country. Burpee lists three French 
filet varieties in its 1989 catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
YELLOW WAX BEANS: Wax beans are often sold at a premium price in the market, 
yet they are as easy as green beans to grow. Many people feel that wax beans 
have a richer flavor than green beans. 
</P>
<P>
Like green beans, yellow wax beans come in both bush and pole varieties. The 
bush varieties grow rapidly and reach harvest stage about 50 days after 
planting. The pole wax beans take longer to mature, but they also produce over 
a longer period. 
</P>
<P>
Good bush wax bean varieties include Goldcrop, Pencil Pod, Burpee Brittle and 
Surcrop Stringless. Two good pole varieties are Burpee Golden and Kentucky 
Wonder Wax. 
</P>
<P>
LIMA BEANS: Fresh lima beans are almost impossible to obtain anymore unless you 
grow them yourself. Most commercially grown limas are sold to processing plants 
for freezing. Although many frozen limas are of good quality, there is still no 
comparison with the rich, nut-like flavor of limas fresh from the garden. 
</P>
<P>
There are quite a few bush lima varieties. My favorite bush lima is Burpee's 
Improved. It has very large flavorful beans, which are produced on 20-inch 
plants in profuse quantities. Fordhook No. 242 is a good variety in the warmer 
inland areas of Southern California as it is heat-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Lima beans also are available in climbing varieties and are called pole limas. 
Pole limas mature later than bush varieties and need the support of trellises 
or poles. However, they produce more beans per square foot of garden space. 
</P>
<P>
I grow my pole limas on a 6-foot-high trellis of chicken wire, stretched 
between two-by-four posts. They may also be trained along a fence that receives 
full sun. As for pole lima varieties, I feel the old favorite, King of the 
Garden, is still the best variety. 
</P>
<P>
GARBANZO BEANS: Botanically speaking, garbanzos are not really beans, but are 
closely related. Garbanzos, also called chickpeas, are best known in this 
country as interesting additions to bean salad. However, in some areas of the 
world, garbanzos are the most important source of protein, and in others they 
are indispensable ingredients in a variety of dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Garbanzos are attractive items in the home garden. The unusual plants have 
fern-like foliage. The leaves are composed of many hairy oval leaflets. The 
beans are produced inside small pods and are light brown in color with a rich 
nut-like flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Garbanzos have similar cultural requirements as beans, and the instructions 
that follow are fine for garbanzos. 
</P>
<P>
The usual method of harvesting garbanzos is to let the pods fully mature on the 
plants and then cut the plants and dry the beans. 
</P>
<P>
CULTURAL REQUIREMENTS: Beans are a warm-season vegetable and may be planted any 
time from early spring to midsummer in most areas of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Beans, as do other vegetables, respond to organic material in the soil. Add 
compost, peat moss, well-aged manures or other such amendments and a vegetable 
fertilizer. Water thoroughly and allow the soil to settle for a few days before 
sowing the seed. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the planting instructions on the seed packets, paying careful attention 
to spacing and thinning. If you have prepared your soil, you will not have to 
fertilize beans during their growing period. 
</P>
<P>
Keep beans watered on a regular basis -- at least once a week. Avoid overhead 
watering, as this promotes diseases. 
</P>
<P>
After planting beans, I cover the soil with a mulch of newspapers that I keep 
damp to prevent the soil from crusting over. This practice results in a higher 
germination rate. You must check under the newspapers daily and remove them 
immediately when the plants have emerged through the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Beans are best grown in rows. They are not a good container crop because many 
plants are necessary for a good harvest.

JAMES GARNER: A WEIGHT OFF HIS BROAD SHOULDERS; 
</P>
<P>
A WINNER AT LAST IN HIS BATTLE WITH UNIVERSAL, THE HOLLYWOOD VETERAN IS FREE TO 
WORK -- OR TAKE IT EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Garner is standing on the lawn in front of the Virginia Science Museum in 
Richmond, Va., ignoring for the moment the business at hand -- his film crew, 
the 1930s automobiles and the frenetic James Woods rehearsing a scene from the 
upcoming Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie, "My Name is Bill W." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a huge blue parka to shield him from the chill, Garner is surrounded by 
a clamoring group of fans, aged 5 to 75, who want nothing more than to get his 
attention and his autograph. As each scrap of paper is thrust in front of him, 
Garner signs with gusto. Middle-aged women thank him with enthusiastic hugs. 
Their 20-year-old daughters do the same. One old man watching Garner charm 
Virginia belles of all ages asks him what kind of after shave he uses. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved that show 'Maverick,' " another man tells Garner. "That was the best 
one you ever did." Garner chuckles, realizing that despite everything he has 
done since, more than 40 movies and several other TV series, he will never be 
anything but that wisecracking gambler to a whole generation of fans. 
</P>
<P>
Still, more than half the autograph hounds pressing him for a few kind words 
were not even born when "Maverick" went on the air some 32 years ago. For many 
of them, Garner will always be the conniving private detective Jim Rockford. 
Some of the youngest probably remember him only as one of TV's most prolific 
commercial pitchmen -- the lovable quipster who used to hawk Polaroid cameras 
with Mariette Hartley or the rugged man's man who used to push beef and Mazdas. 
Now 60 and the producer of "quality" TV movies, Garner projects the same solid, 
home-on-the-range-kind-of-guy image that has made him one of the most enduring 
television stars of all time. 
</P>
<P>
But his 35 years in show business haven't been as congenial as his congenial 
public demeanor suggests. When it comes to business -- and by his own admission 
he has always been in this business for the cash -- Garner is a maverick, 
noisily fighting the Hollywood establishment for the money he insists is 
rightly his. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been easy. He says the stress from his protracted legal battles with 
Hollywood has contributed in part to numerous health problems as well as 
heartache, bitterness and Angst. He has survived two heart surgeries within the 
last year, including a quintuple bypass last April. He has had to give up 
smoking. He has had to cut back on his consumption of thick, juicy steaks. And 
his reconstructed coronary arteries now require that he walk every day on a 
rented treadmill, even while on location in his spartan suite at the Richmond 
Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
But Garner never gives up. And eventually, as evidenced by his 
multimillion-dollar out-of-court settlement with MCA-Universal just two weeks 
ago, Garner always wins. 
</P>
<P>
On March 23, Garner finally settled his eight-year battle with Universal over 
his 37.5% share of the profits from his hit NBC-TV series "The Rockford Files." 
Garner had sued Universal for $16.5-million-plus punitive damages, claiming 
that the studio's "shady" accounting procedures had robbed him of millions. 
Before the settlement, Universal's accountants had determined that despite 
taking in more than $120 million in revenues from syndication, foreign and 
other sales, the show had earned less than $1 million in profits. Garner's 
share of those profits until two weeks ago had been a relatively paltry 
$249,313. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, Garner could not reveal the amount of the 
settlement -- he previously had turned down a $6-million offer -- but it was 
apparently enough to keep him smiling for at least the entire week after 
settling his case. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife keeps telling me to wipe the smirk off my face," Garner said from his 
home in Brentwood a few days after the settlement, proving once again that vast 
sums of money really do make people happy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is justice in the world if you stick around and fight (the studios) long 
enough. The problem is a lot of people don't have the money or the time or the 
stamina to fight it to the end. A lot of people can't risk their career the way 
I did. There was a lot of mental anguish and heartache. But it was definitely 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in Richmond last month just a few days before the case was supposed 
to go to trial, Garner said he was eager to tell his story to a jury. Banking 
on his enormous popularity, he was confident a jury would take his side in his 
arduous one-man battle against the studio giant. He also said he was determined 
to force Universal to reveal publicly its "bookkeeping tricks," and thereby put 
a stop to those practices common to all studios that, he said, continually 
deprive actors and producers of the money they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Those "bookkeeping tricks," according to Garner's suit and a story chronicling 
the financial odyssey of "The Rockford Files" in Barron's magazine, include: 
Universal paying huge sums to itself for distributing the show; Universal 
charging the show interest "on the theory that the company could have invested 
the money spent on production in, say, certificates of deposits and earned 
income"; underestimating revenues by not crediting discounts for various 
services such as duplication of episodes to the "Rockford" account; charging 
"Rockford" for the striking of sets that were never struck, for employee fringe 
benefits that were never paid and "playing fast and loose with the rules 
governing how much the show paid to rent props, costumes and other production 
paraphernalia from Universal." 
</P>
<P>
MCA-Universal has refused to comment on Garner's suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I made 'Rockford' not to have a job, but that was the one I was going to make 
money on. That's why you do a television series," said Garner, who quit 
"Rockford" in disgust half way through the 1980 season. "And that show damn 
near killed me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finished with 'Rockford,' I really didn't want to be in the business 
anymore. I remember making statements at the time that I didn't want to put any 
more paintings on (Universal boss) Lew Wasserman's walls. I was sick of working 
-- hard, physical work that literally damn near killed me, and nobody gets paid 
but them. That'll take the heart out of you after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Garner speculated that Universal chose to settle rather than risk a jury trial 
and a public accounting of its books. Nonetheless, Garner said that his long 
fight and hefty settlement had "put a nick in the studios' old ways, a small 
chink in their armor." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to change their basic attitude," said Garner, who also walked 
out on "Maverick" at the height of its popularity in 1960, demanding that 
Warner Bros. increase his share of the financial pie. The studio refused and 
tried to replace Garner with other actors. But the series was never the same 
and died shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"The (studios) are of the mentality that they're going to get what they can any 
way they can, and if you want what's yours you will have to come get it. But I 
think if more people had fought them or would fight them in the future, the 
practice of creative bookkeeping would be much less frequent. If they see they 
can't get away with it, they'll stop. My advice to other people is what's yours 
is yours so go fight for it." 
</P>
<P>
Already wealthy and now relatively healthy and free from his time-consuming 
legal wars, Garner is ready to resume the good life -- hitting the golf links 
again with a vengeance and prowling the sidelines at Raider football games. He 
still makes little effort to conceal his rancor for the studios whenever he 
muses on the subject of money. But his "comfortable" life style now assured for 
the rest of his days, Garner said he feels much more generous toward Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been really down on the business for the last 10 years," Garner said, 
"and maybe I do feel better toward the industry now that this fight is finally 
over. I'm willing to read scripts where I wasn't before. My agent had to force 
me to read anything. Now I will reevaluate a lot of things that I turned down. 
I read two scripts last night, and I'll tell you something funny. One of them 
came from Universal. That shows you. They don't care about any of this at all." 
</P>
<P>
Through all his TV incarnations and off-screen turmoil, Garner is still in 
great demand all over Hollywood. He is a skilled and respected actor who never 
really acts -- at least not in the way Dustin Hoffman or Robert De Niro act. 
Much like John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, Garner's image -- a real man's man, a 
debonair rogue with a quick wit and irresistible charm -- precedes him. He just 
is up there on the screen, and whatever he is on the screen, people seem to 
love it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never tried to analyze the secret to being popular," Garner said. "I'm 
just very fortunate. I guess I'm just one of those guys who walks in the door 
and is 6-foot-2 with this square jaw and dark hair who they all said just 
couldn't help but be a star." Garner says that part of his renewed enthusiasm 
for the business comes from his success in recent years in playing more 
emotional, human characters involved in genuine human struggles in TV movies 
such as "Heartsounds" and "Promise" and features such as "Murphy's Romance." 
</P>
<P>
But, his financial windfall aside, much of his renewed zeal stems from two 
Hallmark Hall of Fame movies, the 1986 drama "Promise" and "My Name is Bill 
W.," a biography of the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, airing April 30 on 
ABC-TV, which he starred in and produced under the banner of his own production 
company. "Promise," in which Garner played a small-town bachelor who is forced 
to care for his schizophrenic brother played by Woods, won five Emmys in 1986, 
including best drama of the year for producer Garner and best actor for Woods. 
</P>
<P>
"My Name is Bill W." again stars Woods as Bill Wilson, the fast-talking drunk 
who started an organization that has literally saved the lives of millions, and 
Garner, in a small role as Dr. Bob, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"As an actor, you always want to do good stuff, but I guess I just got to the 
point where I said, 'I can live comfortably. I don't have to do trash just for 
the money anymore.' I'm no crusader. I'm still in the entertainment business. 
But whenever we can find a story that says something about the condition of 
man, that's what we want to do," said Garner. 
</P>
<P>
Said his business partner, Peter Duchow: "In the last few years, since he 
decided to do television again, from 'Heartsounds' (a TV movie co-starring Mary 
Tyler Moore about the emotional trauma a family experiences when one member 
suffers a heart attack) to 'Promise' to this, it hasn't been bad television. Of 
course I'm leaving out one." Duchow omitted Garner's role in "Space," the 
ponderous, critically panned miniseries based on James Michener's novel. He 
also didn't mention Garner's starring performance in the forgettable 1984 
feature "Tank." 
</P>
<P>
But under the Garner-Duchow label, Garner is genuinely committed to producing 
one "not bad" TV film every few years. Something, he says, that makes people 
take notice, that moves them. His company currently is developing a story about 
the American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
It's a peculiar dichotomy, this late commitment to quality TV films and 
Garner's shameless admission that he got into this business and stayed in it 
primarily to make money. It's a curious contradiction for a man who is willing 
to battle the studios for every dollar he can get and peddle products for big 
bucks on the side. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, after a stint in the Korean War and after doing some 70 different 
unappealing jobs, including sailor, soldier, bathing suit model and carpet 
layer, Garner, then 25, was offered a role on stage in "The Caine Mutiny 
Court-Martial." The Oklahoma-born heartthrob was an introvert and acting scared 
"the hell out of" him, but three years later, he was a big-time TV star. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I didn't want any part of it, but I couldn't think of another way to 
make a good living," Garner said. "It certainly wasn't that I had some 
wonderful dream of being an actor. I gave myself five years to make it and 
before I knew it, I was in 'Maverick,' and the years kept going by, and 
suddenly I realized that I had been around for a long time. But all along I 
just thought I was some young guy trying to get along in the business." 
</P>
<P>
Garner likes to cultivate the idea that he is still a guy -- a little older, 
wiser but no worse for wear -- trying to get along in the business. It's just 
that now he is a guy with clout. He makes quality movies, it seems, because he 
can. And it seems he will do commercials for wheelbarrows full of cash because 
he can do that, too. 
</P>
<P>
He is a control freak. By his own admission, he sometimes meddles a bit too 
much as executive producer on the set of "Bill W." when he should just be 
acting. As the Richmond air gets colder and shadows from the sinking sun get 
longer, Garner scurries away from the autograph seekers to hurry his production 
crew along. 
</P>
<P>
"Garner's not too bad," said Daniel Petrie, the director of "My Name is Bill 
W." "Occasionally he'll have a little flair of the executive producer in him 
and worry out loud about the money or the schedule. But mostly he keeps his 
acting hat on around the set and lets us all do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Though Garner has always viewed work as a necessary evil and though his bank 
account is now reinforced to the point where he could spend the rest of his 
days lolling happily around on a bright-green fairway somewhere, it's still 
hard to imagine Garner not working, not mixing it up with the studios, not 
trading knowing looks with Woods in front of a camera, not cheerfully bantering 
with his admirers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I just love Jim because he's the real thing," said Woods during a break in the 
shooting of 'Bill W.' "The motor doesn't switch gears when he gets on the 
screen. The same solid, real, definite, direct human being that you deal with 
every day in real life is right there on the screen in front of you. There is 
no interface between the world of truth and the world of acting. It's one and 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Garner says he plans to move out of Los Angeles. "I've been here since the 
'40s," he said, "and I'm just getting sick of it. It's terrible to see what's 
happened to the city. I want to get away from the gridlock and all the filth 
and the crime." And Garner predicts that in the future it might be a bit more 
difficult to get him out of the wide-open spaces of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But he is a television star. And television stars who have endured for 35 years 
aren't about to fade quietly into the red-rock mountains of the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep acting and producing and we'll keep finding these films every once 
in a while," Garner said, a bit weary from a long day of acting, executive 
producing and reminiscing about his career. "The acting is still fun. I enjoy 
creating with other actors. There's nothing better than coming home and telling 
my wife, 'Boy, we had a good scene today.' And I do enjoy the producing. 
Getting the film made the way you want it made. That's fun for me. I'm sure 
I'll keep doing that. I mean, a guy's still got to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it means doing it with a rich guy's smile pasted eternally to his 
multimillion-dollar face.

TWENTY YEARS OF L.A. THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
A REPORT CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle celebrates "Twenty Years of Los 
Angeles Theater" at the Sheraton Grande Hotel. Times Theater Critic Dan 
Sullivan looks back over those two decades and reports on what went right, what 
went wrong and what didn't go at all. 
</P>
<P>
Lou, the guy at the next desk, didn't get it. "You're going to be reviewing the 
Broadway openings for the L.A. Times?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, Lou, I'm going to be reviewing the L.A. openings for the L.A. Times." 
</P>
<P>
"No fooling. They got theater out there?" 
</P>
<P>
And so I left 43rd Street and, yes, they had theater "out there." 
</P>
<P>
It was January, 1969, and a lot was happening. The Taper was in its second 
season and was about to send a show to Lincoln Center: "In the Matter of J. 
Robert Oppenheimer." The Ahmanson was hosting the Royal Shakespeare Company's 
"Doctor Faustus," featuring an eerie parade of Hieronymus Bosch mutants. The 
RSC wouldn't play New York until the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Beah Richards and Yaphet Kotto were doing "Macbeth" at the Inner City Cultural 
Center. "Hair" had just opened at the Aquarius, the show that proved that L.A. 
could sustain a long run (two years). "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" was 
doing nicely at the Ivar, featuring Gary Burghoff, soon to be of "M.A.S.H." 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Doolittle had a subscription series going at the Huntington Hartford, the 
nicest proscenium theater in town. The Theatre Guild was bringing road 
companies into the now-defunct Lindy Opera House. (Bad ones, but still). And 
down on Robertson Boulevard we had the Company Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the Company Theatre. Steve Kent and his colleagues had gone through USC 
together (playing Watts before the Watts riots) and they didn't see any reason 
to split after graduation. So they rented a shack on Robertson and set up as a 
theater collective. 
</P>
<P>
Very '60s, that impulse. So was the work. It was visionary, energetic, 
magnificently naive: As if you could imagine a new world into being if only you 
imagined hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
One night the Company brought its signature piece, "The Emergence" to Pomona 
College. It ended with a radiant light show, engineered by Russell Pyle. There 
was a moment of silence. Then, from the back, somebody said, "Faaaaaahr . . . 
out." It was a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Theater would see plenty of laser lights and smoke-effects over the next twenty 
years. The difference was that the Company believed in them. The group couldn't 
live on transcendence alone and broke up in the '70s, after a period when the 
faction that carried the dream (if not the name) became known as the 
ProVisional Theatre. But the radiance lingers. 
</P>
<P>
The Company won an award at the first LADCC awards dinner (actually a luncheon 
at the Press Club). Another winner was a Chicano group from Central California 
called El Teatro Campesino. They did ironic little sketches called actos, 
including one about a barrio kid who goes off to claim his manhood and his 
death in Vietnam -- "El Soldado Razo." The author and director was Luis Valdez. 
We would see plenty of him too. 
</P>
<P>
No, theater in L.A. in '69 wasn't chopped liver. It had an audience -- Los 
Angeles Civic Light Opera's subscription list was said to top 150,000 -- and it 
was starting to have a structure. The story since then is how the structure has 
evolved. 
</P>
<P>
The saddest story is the decline of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. LACLO's 
taste was stuck back in the 1940s, but it was a resident theater before the 
term was invented. 
</P>
<P>
Its ties with the community were superb. When a customer complained that 
"Cabaret" was off-color, he would get a letter from founder-director, Edwin 
Lester, commiserating with him and offering him extra tickets to the next show, 
if that would help. 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions were so coveted that a San Marino man, it was said, had passed 
his down to his son in his will. A list of local guarantors took up four pages 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
What could go wrong? It all went wrong, and today LACLO has a skimpy 
subscription list, totally controlled by the Nederlander Organization, which 
once appended this friendly note to a season's prospectus: "Canceled checks do 
not guarantee seating." If you believe in local control -- that a community's 
art institutions should be operated by people with a stake in the community -- 
the CLO's death was a major defeat. 
</P>
<P>
But the principle was vindicated almost everywhere else. The Taper didn't 
become a booking house. The Hartford (renamed for Jimmy Doolittle) didn't get 
torn down for a parking lot. Inner City and the East West Players, the Odyssey 
Theatre Ensemble and Theatre West, El Teatro Campesino and Theatre 40, are all 
still in business. (Company of Angels got burned out in '88 and has just 
reopened in Silver Lake.) 
</P>
<P>
And a small Costa Mesa theater called South Coast Repertory grew up to win a 
1988 Tony award for being a distinguished American resident theater. 
</P>
<P>
What's remarkable is how many of the key players of '69 are still making 
theater here, sometimes in a fine new plant. Even more remarkable is the 
reclaiming of a theater that was about to go down the tubes in '69, the 
Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Add our newer theaters -- L.A. Theatre Works, Theatre/Theater, the Back Alley, 
the Victory, the Cast, the Gnu, the Matrix and especially the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center on Spring Street, and the result is a real theater town -- a 
town that generates most of its own power, without relying on outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
We do import, of course. The key players here were the Shuberts. Impressed with 
CLO's box office figures, they opened their own theater in Century City in '72 
with "Follies." It only ran a few months, but it was as carefully produced as 
it had been on Broadway. And that applied to the musicals that did go on to 
have a long run at the Shubert, from "A Chorus Line" ('76) to "Les Miz," ('88). 
The Shuberts gave value, and when they didn't have a worthwhile product to 
offer, they kept the store dark. 
</P>
<P>
Road companies from New York became a rarity. They weren't needed. The Taper 
could mount its own production of "The Real Thing" ('86). The Pasadena 
Playhouse could do its own "Steel Magnolias" ('88). LATC and San Francisco's 
American Conservatory Theatre could collaborate on "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" 
('87). The production would have authority, while fitting the needs of this 
space and this audience. A great improvement over the silliness of "There's a 
Girl in My Soup" at the old Lindy Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. audience became increasingly knowledgeable. The Olympic Arts Festival 
of '84 and the Los Angeles Festival of '87 were key events here. Incredibly, 
some local theater people grumbled about each. It was as if they didn't want 
their work being compared with that of giants like Ariane Mnouchkine and Peter 
Brook. How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm, after they've seen "The 
Mahabharata"? 
</P>
<P>
Only -- it's not the farm. Something we were often in danger of forgetting over 
the 20 years, because theater in Los Angeles means theater in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
I have a horror story about this. I'm standing in the lobby of the Hartford in 
the spring of '74. I'm just back from seeing "The Front Page" in London and I'm 
eager to see it with American actors. Up comes the press agent. "Oh, Dan," he 
says, "Mr. X (naming the star) says he knows that his hair is too long for the 
part, but he's up for a Western at Universal." 
</P>
<P>
One saw the priorities. One kept seeing them. For instance, there was the night 
that Dinah Manoff had to miss her own opening in LATC's "Alfred and Victoria" 
('86). She was doing a "Murder She Wrote" episode at Universal. 
</P>
<P>
The hope back in '69 was that L.A. would become the new London, a town where an 
actor could pursue a film career and a stage career simultaneously. What we 
hadn't realized was that, whereas in London everyone would understand that the 
stage commitment must come first, in L.A. it would be the Industry commitment. 
</P>
<P>
This habit of mind strengthened the already existing attitude that doing 
theater in L.A. was an optional activity, like doing summer stock. ("The Best 
Man" at the Ahmanson in '87 was summer stock.) Consequently, when a serious 
film actor decides to do a play, he won't do it in L.A. He'll do it on Broadway 
or in the West End. That's where the challenge is. That's where theater is -- 
well -- theater. 
</P>
<P>
Theater's theater anywhere, if you respect it. The Industry has disrespected 
it. It's a short-sighted policy. If L.A. theater is a talent pool for the 
Industry, then the Industry should help with the maintenance. I first saw Ed 
Harris in a play at the Callboard Theatre; Nick Nolte at the Westwood 
Playhouse; Richard Dreyfuss at Theatre West. 
</P>
<P>
This brings us to Equity Waiver theater. Edward Weston of Actors' Equity 
devised it in '72 as a way to put more actors to work, even if the work was 
unpaid. The result was a boom in small-theater productions: more than 500 a 
year by the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Waiver kept a lot of actors happy. ("Give me a job and the rest of the crap 
will get solved" -- "A Chorus Line.") But it didn't put any food on the table. 
Last fall, Equity demanded that the theaters start forking over at least $5 a 
performance. After a long battle, they are now doing so, and most of the 
producers are still in business. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the evolution. What did the last 20 years of Los Angeles theater 
add up to artistically? What did the community create, as opposed to import? 
</P>
<P>
A report card might read: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare: D- 
</P>
<P>
Only one world-class performance in 20 years: Victor Buono's Falstaff in Gordon 
Davidson's staging of "Henry IV, Part One" at the Taper in '72. Shakespeare at 
the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego wasn't bad at all. But Shakespeare in L.A. 
meant Charlton Heston addressing the multitudes in "Macbeth" ('75) at the 
Ahmanson or Charles Marowitz cutting up "Hamlet" ('85) at the Los Angeles 
Actors' Theatre, the forerunner of LATC. Or worse. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, we had something called the L.A. Shakespeare Festival. Producer 
Peg Yorkin abandoned it because she didn't like Shakespeare. You get the same 
sense at many local productions: That the actors don't like Shakespeare's 
language, can't untangle it, can't behave in it. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Bring in a Brit who likes American actors, and will teach them how to 
speak Shakespeare in American. A candidate: Simon Callow. His staging of LATC's 
"Jacques and His Master" ('87) combined a classical attack with a multi-racial 
sound -- very clear, very us. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Classics: C+ 
</P>
<P>
Not a brilliant record here, either, but the language problem was less. Some 
highlights: Richard Chamberlain in "Cyrano de Bergerac" at the Ahmanson ('73); 
the Taper's "Major Barbara" ('71); LAAT's "Waiting for Godot" ('77); South 
Coast Repertory's "The Playboy of the Western World" ('83). 
</P>
<P>
Each cast had the patina of an established classical rep company, and for a 
moment one could pretend that such a thing finally had come to Southern 
California, courtesy of the Getty Museum, perhaps. Why don't we have a 
world-class rep theater? Because nobody wants it badly enough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Revivals: A 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood is full of good vernacular actors, and we rarely see an 
unsatisfactory performance of a vintage American play. (Or, for that matter, of 
a straightforward realistic new play.) This is our tradition, and we're good at 
it. If the script seems old-hat, we'll find a way to finesse it, as Charles 
Marowitz did when he staged "The Petrified Forest" ('85) at LATC. We can do the 
'30s, the '40s and the '50s in our sleep. Sometimes we do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Plays: B 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there's been an enormous effort to find them. Back in the '60s, the 
Taper's New Theatre for Now series was a novelty. Today it's almost too easy 
for a new L.A. playwright to get a hearing. He may even find that his script 
gets "developed" out from under him, as happened to Jon Robin Baitz and "Dutch 
Landscape" at the Taper this season. This was an example of the process running 
away with the product. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there has got to be a process. The location and development of new 
scripts is at the heart of a creative theater's mission. All three of our 
leading houses have a good all-over record here: the Taper, LATC and South 
Coast Rep. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper's many prizes included Derek Walcott's "Dream on Monkey Mountain" 
('70), Dan Berrigan and Saul Leavitt's "The Trial of the Catonsville Nine" 
('71), Michael Cristofer's "The Shadow Box" ('75), Luis Valdez's "Zoot Suit" 
('78) and Mark Medoff's "Children of a Lesser God" ('79). LATC gave us Baitz's 
"The Film Society," Jose Rivera's "The Promise" and two fine new scripts by 
Marlane Meyer -- "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish" (all in '88). South Coast Rep 
commissioned and produced work by Keith Reddin, Craig Lucas, Timothy Mason and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The Waiver houses did their bit for new playwrights too. Foremost among them 
was John Steppling, whose dark vision of the California Dream has obviously 
influenced Meyer. Steppling surfaced through the Padua Hills Festival, was 
taken up by Susan Loewenberg's L.A. Theatre Works (at the Night House), and 
Scott Kelman's Pipeline, ran his own season at Ted Schmitt's Cast Theatre and 
has also worked -- not always happily -- at the Taper and LATC. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the '80s, we could almost talk about an L.A. school of 
playwrights. It would include young Jamie Baker, who had two pungent family 
plays done in Waiver houses last season, "Don't Go Back to Rockville" and 
"South Central Rain." Good prospects here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting Ensembles: C 
</P>
<P>
We saw many fine ad-hoc ensembles -- the gang that did Steven Berkoff's "Greek" 
('82) for L.A. Theatre Works, for example. But not until the recent work of the 
Actors Gang -- "Violence" ('86) at the Wallenboyd and "Carnage" ('87) at MOCA 
-- did you feel that old Company Theatre flame. The only consistent theater 
ensemble is the Taper's ITP (Improvisational Theatre Project), which does plays 
for children and mostly works in the schools. ITP's production of Doris 
Baizley's "Guns" in '77 burns in the memory -- it needs a revival in the era of 
the Uzi and the AK 47. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Theater: C- 
</P>
<P>
A hot genre in the late '60s, and the Taper was thought to be at the forefront 
of it. But the urge waned. It was easy enough to dramatize the Vietnam War 
("Tracers" at the Odyssey -- '80) and the resistance to it (the Taper's "The 
Trial of the Catonsville Nine" -- '71, the Odyssey's "Chicago Conspiracy Trial" 
-- '79). But how do you put the oil crisis on stage? Or inflation? Or a local 
rent strike? 
</P>
<P>
Actually this is quite possible, as the San Francisco Mime Troupe has 
demonstrated on occasional trips south. But it means risking being an agitprop 
theater, and nobody wants to fall into that trap. 
</P>
<P>
So the Taper looked askance at racism in Brazil ("Savages" -- '74), in South 
Africa ("Sizwe Banzi is Dead" -- '75) and in 1942 Los Angeles ("Zoot Suit"), 
while confining its examination of contemporary Los Angeles to the feisty old 
people living at the Venice pier ("Number Our Days" -- '82) and the new 
immigrants of "Green Card" ('86). 
</P>
<P>
Prudence was the watchword, and almost all American theaters shared it. One can 
recall only a few local (or national) theater responses to the Reagan years, 
including a pleasant little revue called "Rap Master Ronnie" at the Odyssey 
('85) and the Actors Gang's "Violence," an angry response to the Libyan 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
We did have two tough examinations of the American prison system, LAAT's "Short 
Eyes" in '76 and Taper, Too's "In the Belly of the Beast" ('84) with a superbly 
feral performance from Andrew Robinson as convicted killer Jack Henry Abbott. 
LAAT also went behind the Nixon myth in Donald Freed's "Last Tape and Testament 
of Richard M. Nixon" ('83). Otherwise, a fairly wimpy period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minority Theater: C 
</P>
<P>
The Inner City Cultural Center couldn't keep up its strong early pace, but did 
teach us about the feasibility of color-blind casting, and is still, as they 
say, hanging in there. The East West Players raised our consciousness about 
Asian American theater and brought us Wakako Yamauchi's beautiful "And The Soul 
Shall Dance" ('76), but didn't address the city's new Korean and Vietnamese 
communities. Carmen Zapata's Bilingual Foundation of the Arts found its niche. 
It was a period when much "minority" art showed up on mainstream stages, a 
trend that will continue in the '90s. In L.A., we're all minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experimental: C 
</P>
<P>
The period didn't encourage it, and we didn't see a lot of it. We did get quite 
a lot of performance art, at LACE, at MOCA and especially -- thanks to Scott 
Kelman -- at the former Wallenboyd Theater. The best of it was hard to tell 
from traditional theater, even traditional stand-up comedy. The worst of it was 
hard to tell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design: A 
</P>
<P>
Standards were high, even in Waiver Theater. In Los Angeles, the script may not 
play well, but the designers will imagine an appropriate world for it. Notable 
names here: Robert Zentis, Russell Pyle, the late H. R. Poindexter, Paulie 
Jenkins, A. Clark Duncan, Gerry Hariton and Vicki Baral, Charles Berliner, Noel 
Taylor, Tharon Musser, Cliff Faulkner, Shigeru Yaji, D. Martyn Bookwalter, 
Timian Alsaker, Jon Gottlieb, Garland Riddle, Ralph Funicello, Paulie Jenkins 
and many more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism: C 
</P>
<P>
Too much boosterism, not enough analysis. That's just speaking personally, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
What about the next 20 years? 
</P>
<P>
The first task is to bolt down the structure, which is in place, but still a 
little shaky. Take the L.A. Theatre Center, our gutsiest major house. LATC is 
presenting at least as important work as are the theaters at the Music Center, 
and is doing about three times as much work. But the "Miracle on Spring Street" 
needs more financial backing in the community. LATC won't be able to rely on 
the Community Redevelopment Agency to cover its shortfalls forever. 
</P>
<P>
Money will continue to be a problem for everyone. The more serious the theater 
the more it needs a steady ongoing source of support. The new L.A. Arts 
Endowment will be able to help our theater somewhat, but the most logical 
guarantor of all would be the Industry, on the grounds mentioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
If a tiny percentage of the budget of each big-budget film and TV series went 
to a live-theater fund (just as a percentage of the costs of a musical 
recording session goes to a live-music fund), our theaters could concentrate 
more on the work, less on the financing. 
</P>
<P>
As for the work, who knows what the '90s will bring? The town needs a serious 
classical theater, but neither the Taper, LATC nor South Coast Rep has a real 
passion for the classics, so if this comes about it's likely to be under 
someone else's leadership. Perhaps the Getty Museum will open a research 
theater or the San Diego Old Globe will start a northern branch. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center faces a great opportunity at the moment. CTG/Ahmanson will be 
working at the Doolittle for the next couple of years, while "The Phantom of 
the Opera" reigns on the Hill. Gordon Davidson will run both CTG/Ahmanson and 
CTG/Taper, which is probably the way it should have been from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson's recent seasons at the Taper have been so "balanced," so careful to 
accommodate everybody's needs, that the theater has lost its excitement. Now 
Davidson has the chance to please the people at the Doolittle and to challenge 
them at the Taper. One doesn't know if that's the game plan, but it would be a 
good one. Challenge was what made the Taper's -- and Davidson's -- reputation. 
</P>
<P>
LATC will continue its brash ways as long as Bill Bushnell is leading it. This 
theater can be outrageously bad ("Barabbas" -- '86). But it loves to go to the 
edge, as somebody in the community has got to do. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory will continue, in its clever way, to deliver more than it 
promises. Who wanted, this season, to see "The Crucible" again? But at SCR, one 
really thought that John Proctor might go free. This theater -- again, without 
making noise -- also does a lot for playwrights who make it big five years 
later. And SCR also comes the closest of anyone to having a real rep company -- 
or at least a core company. May it forever be outside of the L.A. "loop." 
</P>
<P>
Financed or not, the people who learned how to be producers since the 1960s 
will probably keep at it -- the Cast's Ted Schmitt, the Odyssey's Ron Sossi, 
the Back Alley's Laura Zucker and Allan Miller, the Victory Theater's Tom 
Ormeny and Maria Gobetti, the Matrix's Joe Stern (he didn't do a lot, but what 
he did was choice), L.A. Theatre Works' Susan Loewenberg, the Pasadena 
Playhouse's Susan Dietz. 
</P>
<P>
What keeps the flame alive? 
</P>
<P>
Dietz had the best answer when asked by some smart New Yorker why she wanted to 
do theater in Los Angeles. Because, she said, she wanted to live in Los 
Angeles, and doing theater was her trade. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. Ready for Act Two?

ORLANDO, FLA. -- WILL IT BECOME HOLLYWOOD EAST?;

UNIVERSAL AND DISNEY HAVE COMMITTED A COMBINED $1 BILLION FOR PRODUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll blares and nearly a dozen Mouseketeers skip onto a Disney sound 
stage, past the neon diner counter, past a pink refrigerator labeled "Eisner." 
Twenty years ago, this would have been Circus Day at the Mickey Mouse Club. But 
times have changed, so: "It's Thursday, Party Day," exclaims 13-year-old Damon 
Pampolina, "and it's going to be a hot, hot, hot party!" No somber uniforms and 
Mickey Mouse ears for these hot partygoers; they're decked out in jeans and 
high-tops and colorful barrettes. 
</P>
<P>
Ten miles up the highway, at Universal Studios, times also have changed at June 
Cleaver's household. The Beaver is divorced, with two children, and lives at 
home with his widowed mom. On "The New Leave It to Beaver" June still wears 
pearls, but she uses a Cuisinart, dates men and attends classes at the local 
college. 
</P>
<P>
More than style and story line separate these two TV series from the classic 
originals they imitate: Both shows are in production a continent away from 
their Hollywood roots -- in a town known more for souvenir shops than sound 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Mayor Bill Frederick predicts that will change. He has told his 
constituents that someday their city will become the Hollywood of the East. (In 
one speech, he even joked -- or was it a joke? -- that in 50 years, people will 
be referring to Hollywood as Orlando West.) 
</P>
<P>
The local press has dutifully followed suit. Steve Martin's recent arrival on 
the set of Ron Howard's "Parenthood" prompted Orlando magazine to breathlessly 
boast that the city's "Hollywood East hopes have reached new heights. The 
future is upon us." Orlando's ambitions have also drawn attention from national 
news organizations such as NBC and Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't so sanguine about Orlando's show-biz prospects. But Frederick's 
remarks are more than flights of fancy: His vision for Orlando is based on the 
very real $1-billion combined commitments that Disney and Universal Studios 
have made to building production facilities and studio tours in Orlando. There 
are also persistent rumors that Paramount is shopping for land in the area, but 
a Paramount spokeswoman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside "The New Mickey Mouse Club," which will debut April 24 on the Disney 
Channel, the syndicated "Superboy" series is being produced at the Disney-MGM 
Studios (the company is leasing the rights to the MGM name) just a stone's 
throw from Disney World and Epcot Center. The feature film "Ernest Saves 
Christmas" and the TV movie "Splash, Too" were filmed at Disney's Orlando 
facilities, as well as TV shows such as "Win, Lose or Draw," "Siskel &amp; 
Ebert" and a Carol Burnett special. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the children's cable TV network Nickelodeon agreed to bring at 
least 450 hours of original programming annually to Universal's Orlando 
facility. Universal will begin production on the movie "Psycho IV" in Orlando 
this spring. And "Parenthood," an Imagine Ent. film to be released by 
Universal, is already shooting in town. "I probably will be back here," says 
"Parenthood" director Ron Howard, who chose Orlando as a stand-in for the 
story's setting, St. Louis, Mo. "The local talent pool will only improve." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
That's all great news for the locals, but can Orlando really ever rival 
Hollywood? "Not in my lifetime," is the common response from studio executives 
and public officials there. In his more serious moments, Frederick confesses, 
"I don't think anyone is expecting Hollywood to surrender its crown." 
Short-term, the mayor expects film and TV production to become one of his 
city's four largest industries, alongside agriculture, tourism and high 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
The level of production in Orlando at this point is so tiny that it probably 
equals the volume flowing through just four or five blocks of Sunset Boulevard. 
Cathy Savino, who coordinates film production in three counties for the 
privately funded Economic Development Commission, predicts that the Orlando 
area will play host to $30 million in TV and film production this year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Florida captured $224 million worth of productions, compared to 
California's $4.7 billion, the bulk of which landed in Southern California. Ben 
Harris, chief of Florida's Motion Picture and Television Bureau, says his state 
will be doing well if, within the next five years, its share of production 
rises to $1 billion annually -- that's still only one-quarter of California's 
current total. 
</P>
<P>
Here's another telling fact: Universal, home to "The New Leave It to Beaver," 
now has four state-of-the-art sound stages. Sometime in the 1990s, that will 
grow to 11 -- still only one-third the number that Universal now has on its 
Southern California property. Disney has built three sound stages on its 
property and has plans for more (how many, executives are not saying). 
</P>
<P>
Both studios lease their sound stages and backlots to outsiders. "The intent 
was to make them available to anyone," says Dan Slusser, general manager of 
Universal Studios. Disney offers producers in-house costumers, technicians and 
post-production facilities run by Hollywood's The Post Group. Universal has 
brought in outside production support, so companies such as Panavision, Lee 
Lighting and Polyeffects have set up shop on the property. 
</P>
<P>
But just as it would be an exaggeration to call Orlando the next Hollywood, it 
would be shortsighted to underestimate Orlando's threat to film and TV business 
in Hollywood and elsewhere. The reason is this: Both Disney and Universal are 
committed to ambitious studio tours in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's tour, which opens May 1, is built on 135 acres and features a backlot 
with recreations of Hollywood Boulevard in the '30s and '40s, New York City's 
brownstones and a residential neighborhood. The tour also includes "The Great 
Movie Ride" and "Star Tours," a copy of the Disneyland ride. Universal's 
444-acre attraction, opening next year, will make its L.A. tour look quaint by 
comparison. Like Disney, Universal has a backlot with Hollywood and New York 
landmarks. It also includes settings from San Francisco, Italy and a recreation 
of the town of Amity -- the fictional beach community made infamous in "Jaws" 
-- all set around a huge lagoon. The studio is building the two largest sound 
stages in the world to house its "King Kong" and "E.T." rides. There will also 
be a "Jaws" ride. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their huge investments in these tourist attractions, both studios 
have an interest in hyping Orlando as a next-generation Hollywood. It also 
means that they will be scrambling to attract production to Orlando in the 
future -- enough to give their tourists a behind-the-scenes peek at TV and the 
movies seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest money maker, no question, will be the tourist side," says Norman 
R. Rice, vice president and studio manager at Universal's Orlando facility. 
"The only way it makes sense to build more sound stages is because of the tour. 
But, then, the Universal Studios tour only works because there is actual 
production." 
</P>
<P>
Ditto for Disney. Drawing production to Orlando is so important that even 
Disney's most senior executives are soliciting business for the area. "One of 
the key people who makes calls is a guy by the name of Michael Eisner," says 
Disney's Ted Kaye, vice president for Orlando studio operations, referring to 
the company's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to leasing its sound stage and production facilities, Disney is 
promoting its 28,000 acres of land -- a parcel twice the size of Manhattan that 
includes a nature preserve and a network of roads, as well as Disney World and 
Epcot Center -- as a prime location for shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Both Disney and Universal courted Nickelodeon when it began looking south to 
consolidate its production. Universal wanted the business so badly that it 
agreed to build Nickelodeon two custom-designed sound stages at no charge. 
Nickelodeon doesn't even have to pay rent, just agree to film on the property 
seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, during all hours of the tour's operation -- 
not a bad deal. "It's a dream come true, " said Geoffrey Darby, the channel's 
senior vice president for production. 
</P>
<P>
Nickelodeon's move underscores the role that Orlando is most likely to assume 
over the next decade: What's good news for Orlando is bad news for Hollywood, 
New York and other cities that have hosted Nickelodeon shows. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than topple Hollywood, the more realistic scenario for Orlando is this: 
It will increase the threat of production running away from California, whose 
share of the feature film business has dropped from 80% to 70% in recent years; 
it will grab much of the burgeoning cable TV business that might have gone to 
L.A. or New York; it will lure away some of New York's lucrative TV commercial 
business; and it will become a warm-weather alternative to Canada, where 
producers have flocked in recent years to take advantage of cheaper labor costs 
and a weak Canadian dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the industry will stay in Hollywood because of inertia," says Rice. 
"But there will be a lot that don't want to put up with the traffic and the 
(location) permit situation there. I think you will see a new production center 
emerging in Orlando. There's a certain snobbishness among the people who say 
that the only place to make a film is Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Says Disney's Kaye: "For the foreseeable future, Orlando will develop into a 
regional production center. It's not Hollywood East, it's Toronto South." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Norm Rice looks out the window at the pouring rain, and then down at his watch. 
"It was supposed to stop raining by 11," he says, a little dejected. 
</P>
<P>
Locals like to think that weather is one of Orlando's biggest selling points. 
But, in fact, the area is hot and muggy in the summer and subject to torrential 
rains in the winter. (Disney even constructed its backlot to withstand 
hurricanes.) One recent week, in March, was not a good advertisement for the 
city -- wind, cold and ceaseless downpours repeatedly interrupted 
"Parenthood's" outdoor scenes (which are supposed to take place on hot summer 
days). 
</P>
<P>
Savino advertises Orlando to producers as a town that "can look like Anywhere 
USA." But, in fact, the terrain is relentlessly flat, without California's 
mountains and deserts and beaches. And the city itself has the pristine 
lifelessness of an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
A better advertisement for Orlando is hanging in the area's film commission 
office. A take-off of the famous Hollywood sign that instead reads "Florida." 
Underneath it says simply, "HOLLYWOOD WEATHER WITHOUT THE HOLLYWOOD OVERHEAD." 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood overhead to which the poster refers is the high cost of labor and 
the headaches of permitting in California. Florida is a right-to-work state, 
which means that unions cannot require individuals to join their ranks. For 
producers, that policy is an invitation to hire non-union crews. 
</P>
<P>
The downside, though, is that Florida crews generally are less experienced than 
crews in unionized New York or California. "There's not that large of a talent 
pool for crews -- it's just getting started, " says Doug Claybourne, who 
produced "Ernest Saves Christmas" in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's right-to-work status is a sensitive topic, and both public officials 
and studio executives downplay the savings of using Florida labor. "It's a 
factor," Savino says. "But I don't think it's one of the main factors" 
attracting production to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"There are differences in labor rates," says Disney's Kaye. But he attributes 
this to what he called staffing patterns. "In a union state there is this 
rigidity of function. When you're in the sort of environment we're in, there's 
this tremendous ability for interchange (among job assignments)." 
</P>
<P>
But pay scales clearly are lower in the state, even among union workers. Frank 
Ladeira, a union electrician working on the "Parenthood" set, said he makes 
about one-third the New York rate. "Let's say in New York you make $30 an hour, 
you come down here and it's $11 or $12," Ladeira said. Michael W. Proscia, 
international vice president for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage 
Employers and Moving Picture Machine Operators (IATSE), agrees that even union 
scales are "considerably lower" in Florida than in New York or California. In 
addition, he noted that the Florida IATSE local 477 in Miami is more willing to 
"make adjustments in working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe (the environment for unions) is vastly improved," Proscia added. 
"Employers realize that the unions are cooperative." Since the IATSE local in 
Miami was founded in 1986, he said, "we've attempted to bring (scales) in line 
with Hollywood agreements. " 
</P>
<P>
State and union officials say they do not have figures on what percentage of 
production in Florida uses non-union crews. But the Screen Actors Guild, which 
boasts 4,000 Florida members -- the third-largest contingent behind California 
and New York -- estimates that 90% of Florida productions work under a SAG 
contract. And SAG rates are standardized nationwide, a guild spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But for extras, the situation is bleaker. The Screen Extras Guild branch in 
Miami has not been successful in making inroads, according to labor sources in 
the state. "We have to pull teeth to get money for these people," says 
Cassandra Carrigan, who runs one of Orlando's most successful talent agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Florida's child labor laws are weak, leaving few protections for 
youngsters recruited as extras. During the recent filming of "Ernest Saves 
Christmas," children were forced to wait on the set 10 to 12 hours before being 
called for their parts, claims Carrigan, who represented many of the children 
on that film. (Claybourne, the film's producer, said he wasn't aware of any 
abuses and added that the film makers fully complied with local labor laws. 
"Any time you have kids on a set, you take extra measures (to protect them)," 
he added. ) 
</P>
<P>
Rather than focus on the labor climate, Orlando's boosters prefer to cite other 
advantages to filming there: the cheap price of land in the area; a one-stop 
permitting system for film producers; and the absence of a state income tax in 
Florida. Moreover, locations are cheaper to rent, and they are not as overused 
as they are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
There's another reason the film industry likes Orlando: Its politicians are 
nice, real nice. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his relationship to executives at the two Orlando studios, 
Mayor Frederick walks over to his desk and pulls out a photo of himself with 
Disney chief Michael Eisner. The two men recently marched in a parade together, 
and Frederick always makes a point of seeing Eisner and most of the company's 
senior management on his visits to L.A. (Disney is Florida's largest employer, 
though Martin Marietta boasts the largest payroll.) 
</P>
<P>
Frederick is also very friendly with top executives at Universal's parent 
company, MCA, including chairman Lew Wasserman and his family. It's a delicate 
matter, given the fiercely competitive atmosphere that has marred relations 
between top management at Disney and Universal. "I try to be very discreet," 
Frederick says. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, when Universal wanted to obtain a $3-million state grant for road 
improvement on its property, "we helped out," says the mayor. When the 
producers of "Leave It to Beaver" made a last-minute decision to shoot a scene 
on a local road, they needed signatures from three county commissioners -- but 
all of them were out of town. So a staffer in the commissioners' office drove 
the permit 90 miles to where the officials were attending a meeting and got 
their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Don't think for a minute that Universal isn't grateful for all this effort. 
When Steven Spielberg, creative consultant to the Universal tour in Orlando, 
was interviewed on national TV, he specifically mentioned Frederick. Not bad 
exposure for any local official with political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
The warm feelings toward Hollywood studios extend up into the ranks of the 
governor's office, where former Gov. Robert Graham eliminated sales tax for 
film producers in the state and current Gov. Bob Martinez has maintained a 
similarly friendly atmosphere. "The state of Florida, and the political leaders 
of Florida, have always been very, very aggressive about courting the film 
industry," says Universal's Slusser. 
</P>
<P>
Disney doesn't have to worry about trivial matters like obtaining filming 
permits. When Walt Disney decided to bring his amusement park east in the 
1960s, he convinced state officials to give his company its own fiefdom, called 
the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The district, which is exempted from 
local land-use regulations, runs its own fire and police departments. 
</P>
<P>
Disney uses that as a selling point with producers: When "Ernest Saves 
Christmas" needed a road for a chase scene, for example, Disney simply shut 
down its own roads. Didn't have to call a single bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando's residents generally have approved of the welcome mat thrown out for 
the studios. A anti-growth county commissioner who raised objections to favored 
treatment for the studios, as well as to introducing new construction in the 
area, was soundly defeated by the voters last fall. "Basically, it's hard to 
oppose the movie industry; it's a good, clean industry," says Jane Healy, 
associate editor of the Orlando Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
It is fitting that "Beaver" and "The New Mickey Mouse Club" are among the first 
regular productions on Orlando. Just as they are imitations of the real thing, 
Orlando is fast becoming a clean, safe -- and artificial -- reproduction of 
Hollywood, a town that invented itself, with all its elements of grunge and 
glamour taking nourishment from show biz. 
</P>
<P>
On their Orlando backlots, both Disney and Universal have painstakingly 
recreated Hollywood's Brown Derby (with an accurate re-creation of the famous 
restaurant's Cobb Salad, Disney boasts), Disney has built a Grauman's Chinese 
Theater, and instead of the famed Thalberg Building in Culver City, Universal 
is building a look-alike Spielberg Building in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Florida almost became a movie production center. In 1916, Jacksonville played 
host to more than 100 film companies, before they packed up and left for the 
West Coast -- in part because local voters overwhelmingly elected anti-show 
business candidates in the city's 1917 election. Later, in 1935, studio moguls 
Louis B. Mayer of MGM and Joseph M. Schenck of 20th Century Fox publicly 
threatened to move their studios to Florida after California's governor 
proposed new taxes on their industry. Mayer said at the time that Florida had 
agreed to exempt the movie industry from taxes for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of becoming home to the movie business, northern and central 
Florida grew up to play host to the space program, New York retirees and Walt 
Disney World. Despite its other industries, Orlando in central Florida is most 
obviously a tourist town, a place where highway exit signs list first and 
foremost the relevant amusement park -- an exit for Wet 'n Wild, for Disney 
World, for Sea World, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sort of place where the locals view Steve Martin -- on location for 
his starring role in "Parenthood" -- as one of the rides. "Because it's a 
tourist town, people are used to having access to everything," says Martin, 
whose every move seems to get reported in the local media. "It's not like New 
York or L.A. . . . There's no etiquette. And you're expected to be friendly all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
But tourism is why the studios are bringing production to Orlando in the first 
place. Not only do their tours help defray the costs of film production, they 
also provide ready audiences for game shows and live programming. By going to 
Orlando, Nickelodeon gets a ready supply of children from all over the country 
to fill in audiences or appear on its shows, as well as the opportunity to 
raise its profile with the millions of families flowing through the Universal 
tour each year. 
</P>
<P>
And tourism makes Orlando a forgiving town for an intrusive industry. True, one 
family living in the neighborhood where "Parenthood" was filming planted a sign 
of protest over Universal's presence -- a relic of the fundamentalist protests 
against the studio's "The Last Temptation of Christ." But most of those 
neighbors gladly suffered through the rerouting of traffic and mobile homes 
parked in their lawns and driveways. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is pretty excited about it," says Sally McArthur, who lives across 
the street from the house where "Parenthood" is filming. "Even people who were 
hesitant at first. I have to walk down the street to get to my car. But that's 
a small price to pay for a chance to rub elbows with major motion picture 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a level of genuineness here, contrasted with some of the 
cynicism you find in L.A.," says Disney's Kaye. "There is this enthusiasm and 
excitement about a growing industry here. I'm too young to have been in the 
golden age of television. But maybe something comparable is happening here." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Orlando's enthusiasm for show business will survive the inconveniences 
the industry inevitably brings remains to be seen. But for now the town is 
welcoming Hollywood with open arms. A new AMC theater complex is equipped with 
a circular driveway so limousines can arrive for movie premieres. And a local 
producer is even trying to syndicate a TV show, called "Movie Lot Magazine," to 
report on the stars who come to town. 
</P>
<P>
Ancillary businesses -- such as equipment renters, prop houses and animal 
trainers -- are springing up. Orlando is even experiencing the sleaze that 
show-business necessarily seems to attract: In this case, fly-by-night talent 
agencies that soak unsuspecting want-to-be's for several hundred dollars before 
disappearing. "They're always just this side of the law, so we can't catch 
them," says Savino. 
</P>
<P>
The flatlands outside Jay Stein's office in Universal City, Calif., are jammed 
with sound stages; to the right a steep hill flows up to the studio's tourist 
attractions. Stein, now president of MCA's recreation services, started his 
career in the company's mail room in 1959, when most of that land was 
undeveloped and the fire department would bring in sheep every year to keep the 
hillside brush from becoming a fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The similarities between the San Fernando Valley then and Orlando now "are 
frightening," Stein says, gazing into the distance. "I think Orlando will look 
exactly like this someday, without the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Orlando could very well grow up to look like parts of L.A., with film and TV 
production facilities rivaling those in New York or Hollywood. But it's less 
likely that Orlando will ever rob Hollywood of its glamour: In a business that 
is built on status, Orlando does not rank high on the lists of preferred 
locations. "We still have the significant volume here, and we have the 
infrastructure," says Lisa Rawlins, director of California's film commission. 
"It will take a long time to build that elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Is a producer or director or star going to want to go to Orlando to make a 
movie? I don't know. . . . There's a difference between putting 'The Mickey 
Mouse Club' or 'Leave It to Beaver' on a sound stage, and trying to get 
(director) Larry Kasdan to make a movie down there." 
</P>
<P>
But, for now at least, Orlando is going to try.

WHY CAN'T L.A. HAVE A MAJOR LEAGUE FILM FESTIVAL?; 
</P>
<P>
AFI / LA FILMFEST PREVIEW: PICKING OUT GOODIES; 
</P>
<P>
THE FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past five years, it has evolved from FILMEX into AFIFEST into its 
current tongue-thickening designation as the American Film Institute Los 
Angeles International Film Festival (AFI/LA FilmFest, for short). 
</P>
<P>
It's traveled from Westwood to Santa Monica to Los Feliz to its present home at 
the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas at Century City's ABC Entertainment 
Center. But, as always, it's a cornucopia of movies, a smorgasbord, a glut: a 
big, rambunctious, eclectic gathering of films (about 123 features and 70 
shorts) both old and mostly new (16 major premieres) from all over the country 
and all around the world (as of last count, from about 45 different nations). 
</P>
<P>
AFI/LA FilmFest officially commences Thursday with the invitation-only premiere 
night. For the public at large, it starts, in earnest, on Friday: eight movies 
at the Cineplex Odeon, running in three different theaters from 6:25 until 
midnight. (That's the usual schedule, except on weekends, when the programs 
begin at noon.) 
</P>
<P>
There are special programs: a six-film marathon devoted to the late, fiery 
innovative American film maker, John Cassavetes (April 22); a series of recent 
films, under the blanket title "Dangerous Loves," scripted by Nobel 
Prize-winning novelist-screen writer -- and one-time film critic -- Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the movies themselves, there are six in-person tributes: for 
director Franklin Schaffner (April 18), French novelist-film maker Alain 
Robbe-Grillet (Apr. 22), actor-director-poet-Vulcan Leonard Nimoy and Muppeteer 
and Kermitmeister Jim Henson (both Saturday) and dancing ladies Cyd Charisse 
(April 23) and Ruby Keeler (April 22). There are also seminars, a TV-movie 
retrospective and a seven-program 70th anniversary salute to cinematographers 
by the American Society of Cinematographers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Wading through all this, you may experience a dizziness, a temporary loss of 
balance. Impossible to see everything -- unless, like the amoeba, you can 
separate into several beings for every showing. So how can you pick or choose? 
</P>
<P>
Should you attend the Finnish documentary on Soviet rock music, "From Russia 
With Rock" (Friday, 10:40 p.m.) or dip and glide next door to the 
simultaneously shown Argentine "Tango, Our Dance" (10:45 p.m.)? Who gains your 
deepest loyalties at 2 p.m., Saturday: the tribute to Man Who Was Spock, the 
Latino Writer's Conference or the Canadian documentary on the Philippine 
revolution? At 6:15 p.m., next Sunday, you have a particularly puzzling and 
pungent selection: a Spanish version of "Frankenstein," the great 
Soviet-Armenian director Sergei Paradjanov's musical version of a Lermontov 
story and a Taiwanese film set in pre-revolutionary China. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes. Late night Thursday, April 20, offers the newest film by Polish 
master Andrzej Wajda (filmed in France from Dostoyevsky's "The Possessed"); a 
Nicaraguan movie, "The Spectre of War," described as a cross between "Platoon" 
and "Flashdance" and a British road comedy, "Vroom," set in working-class 
Lancashire. The 8:45 p.m. slot on Tuesday, April 25, pits Swiss master Alain 
Tanner's latest against a social drama from the Dominican Republic and a series 
of Oscar-winning shorts from the National Film Board of Canada. At 10:25-10:45 
p.m., on Friday, April 21, you have three pictures running against each other 
that almost make up a single title: "The Stupid Years: Two Idiots in Hollywood, 
Afraid to Dance." 
</P>
<P>
There's a method behind this seeming chaos or profusion. According to festival 
director Ken Wlaschin, AFI/LA FilmFest has two primary goals: (1) To give the 
Los Angeles public, and particularly local movie makers, a chance to see what's 
happening throughout the world, especially in film industries whose aims and 
intentions deviate markedly from Hollywood norms; (2) To provide a showcase for 
the new American independent cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Because the AFIFEST bookers go out of their way to select films which, despite 
their quality or intrinsic interest, have not yet found a distributor, L. A.'s 
Film Festival, is not, like New York's, a program of relatively sure things: 
primarily recent films by top American and international directors, many slated 
to open as soon as the festival closes. It's a cross between a more prodigal 
selection like the Chicago Film Festival (or London's, Wlaschin venue before 
coming to Los Angeles) and a distributor's showcase, like the American Film 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
Once you understand this, it becomes easier to tolerate what some critics damn 
-- wrongly, I think -- as AFIFEST's vagaries, excesses or dubious choices. The 
programming is deliberately adventurous, offbeat, chancy -- and purposely 
rather wide-open. 
</P>
<P>
Work by demanding art directors like Paradjanov, Wajda, and France's Alain 
Robbe-Grillet ("La Belle Captive" on Apr. 22) stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 
items like "Hellbent" -- a punk Faust melodrama by a rock video director who 
reveres Ed ("Plan 9 From Outer Space") Wood Jr. (Saturday); "Comic Book 
Confidential," which contains interviews with R. Crumb, Lynda Barry and Harvey 
Kurtzman; and "Ghosts of the Civil Dead" (April 27), a horrific look at prison 
society with script, acting and music by avant-garde rocker Nick Cave. 
</P>
<P>
What are the highlights of the festival? 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of four weeks of press screenings, Times Film Critic Sheila Benson 
recommends Theo Angelopoulos' "Landscapes in the Mist" (from Greece: April 26), 
an evocative journey-tale about the search for a mythical father, and Rafael 
Zelinski's low-rent maternity comedy, "Ginger Ale Afternoon" (U.S.: Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
Film reviewer Kevin Thomas suggests Fernando Solanas' lyrical tale of 
revolution and remembrance, "South" (Argentine: April 27), Juzo Itami's wry 
sequel, "A Taxing Woman's Return" (April 18) and Yojio Takita's satire on 
modern greed, "The Yen Family" (Friday), both from Japan; Andrew Grieve's 
sweeping Welsh family saga, "On the Black Hill" (British: April 19) and Huang 
Shuquin's haunting study of theatrical obsession, "Woman Demon Human" (Chinese: 
April 23). 
</P>
<P>
My own picks, are Paradjanov's exquisitely stylized "Ashik Kerib" (U.S.S.R.: 
April 16); Tanner's "A Flame in My Heart." (Switzerland, April 25), a cool look 
at obsessive passion; Francesca Archibugi's funny-sensitive look at young, 
unrequited love, "Mignon Has Come to Stay" (Italy: April 14); Stanley Kwan's 
perfumed ghost story "Rouge" (April 15) and Alex Law's heartfelt Peking Opera 
memoir, "Painted Faces" (April 16), both from Hong Kong; Merata Mita's 
pantheistic melodrama, "Mauri" (April 15), and Geoff Murphy's slam-bang chase 
thriller, "Never Say Die" (April 26), both from New Zealand; George Sluizer's 
terrifyingly logical nightmare, "The Vanishing" (Dutch: April 21); and two 
films from the Marquez series: Ruy Guerra's sensuous, cruel "Fable of the 
Beautiful Pigeon Fancier" (Brazil: April 16), and Tomas Guttierez Alea's 
lyrical, super-romantic "Letters From the Park" (Cuba: April 15). 
</P>
<P>
A festival insider who's seen most or all of them, suggests, in addition, Derek 
Jarman's "War Requiem," "Comic Book Confidential," "Ghosts of the Civil Dead," 
Henry Jaglom's "New Year's Day" (U.S.: April 22), Vera Chytilova's "The Jester 
and the Queen" (Czech: April 21) and Roger Spottiswoode's "Time Flies When 
You're Alive" (U.S.: April 17). 
</P>
<P>
All of us here urge you to the Cassavetes marathon on noon, Saturday, April 22: 
a long-overdue tribute to a great and all too often neglected or underrated 
American film maker. It includes "Shadows," "Faces," "A Woman Under the 
Influence," "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie" and "Opening Night," plus Michael 
Ventura's sympathetic documentary, "I'm Almost Not Crazy."

TOM SCOTT MAKES THE SAJAK CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time he reached the age of 20, Tom Scott was already a near-veteran of 
the studio and club scenes in Hollywood. He had two Impulse albums to his 
credit, had mastered a dozen instruments (saxes, clarinets, flutes), played 
with Roger Kellaway, Oliver Nelson and Don Ellis, and was a regular on such TV 
series as "Ironsides" and "Good Morning World." Like his father, the veteran 
studio composer Nathan Scott ("Dragnet," "Wagon Train," "Twilight Zone"), he 
had also embarked on a composing career. 
</P>
<P>
At age 40, with a 1,000 credits as a writer for films and TV shows, winner of 
seven Grammy nominations and one Grammy (for his arrangements on Joni 
Mitchell's "Court and Spark"), Scott had a busy and rewarding life in music. It 
seemed like the wrong time for an abrupt change; yet that is what happened late 
last year, when he was approached to lead the band on the new Pat Sajak Show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's odd," he said the other morning before leaving for a rehearsal at CBS, "a 
year ago my wife and I saw Pat Sajak hosting 'A.M. America,' and we noticed 
what a witty job he did; we thought he'd make the ideal host for an evening 
talk show." 
</P>
<P>
Approached late last year by the producer of the projected new series, Scott 
arranged to meet Sajak, "so that we could see if the chemistry would be right 
between us. Well, for a week I asked around about him, to get an idea of what 
he was like. On the basis of what I heard, I decided how to handle the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'It's nice to meet you. I must tell you I've been spending the last 
week, in anticipation of this meeting, trying to find someone who would tell me 
that Pat Sajak is an ass, but I couldn't find anyone to say that.' He laughed 
and said: 'Obviously you didn't speak to my ex-wife.' Anyhow, we hit it off 
right away and became buddies." 
</P>
<P>
Once assigned the job and told he could use seven sidemen, Scott had to decide 
on an instrumentation. "I could have had four horns, but so much contemporary 
music, like country and rock, doesn't use horns much; so along with Jerry 
Peters, who's a very versatile pianist, composer and producer, I got a second 
keyboard player, Barnaby Finch, who can cover various horn or string parts on 
the synthesizers. 
</P>
<P>
"My drummer, Art Rodriguez, and bassist, Tim Landers, both toured Europe last 
year with me and Dave Grusin and Lee Ritenour. They were happy to take a job 
that would keep them in town. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric Gale, a great guitarist, had just moved here from New York, so he was a 
natural choice; and to cover some kinds of contemporary and rock things I got 
Carlos Rios, who's played guitar with Chick Corea and was Lionel Richie's 
musical director." 
</P>
<P>
With one chair still open, Scott decided to use a second horn. "A friend at CBS 
told me about David Koz, a young fellow who plays saxes, flute and the EWI -- 
electronic wind instrument. I didn't know him, just called him out of the blue, 
and he's worked out great. Besides, he's about 26, and most of us in the band 
are around the 40 mark, so it's nice to have a young, good-looking guy in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Using quality as his only criterion, Scott was pleased that he wound up with "a 
sort of Noah's Ark -- a couple of black guys, a couple of Latinos, a couple of 
Jewish guys; I'm sorry we don't have a lady in the band, but I approached 
Patrice Rushen and she was too busy." 
</P>
<P>
The program is building up a fair track record for musical guests; sometimes 
Scott is consulted for ideas. It was he who was responsible for the appearance 
of Take 6, the phenomenal a cappella vocal group. "They were on the show, as it 
turned out, the night after their big Grammy sweep, so I became a hero for 
recommending them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had Chick Corea; George Duke has been booked. Milt Hinton was a 
wonderful guest, playing the bass with us and talking about his autobiography." 
</P>
<P>
The schedule, as for any five-days-a-week show involving musical guests, is 
sometimes hectic. "Depending on how many numbers I have to arrange or 
rearrange, I'll be busy from at least noon, then start rehearsal around two, 
and we tape the shows from 5 to 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Editing down some of the charts can be challenging and fun. When George Burns 
was on, they gave me a full orchestral chart that must have been decades old, 
with all kinds of pencil scratches; I had to adapt it to our small group," 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Among his chores is the assembling of "playon" music for guests associated with 
a particular theme. This is where Scott's state-of-the-art computer comes in 
handly. "I've compiled, via the computer, about 70 'playons' for specific 
people; like, if it's someone from 'Dynasty' or 'Dallas,' we'll use the thing 
they're best known for," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Like his sidemen, Scott is happy to be working steadily in town, the more so 
since (as Sajak's viewers learned from his bulletins over the preceding and 
subsequent days) Scott became the father of a daughter, Owen, born just two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of this milieu, he says, is the respect accorded him. "Unlike 
some areas, such as motion picture composing, you don't have people looking 
over your shoulder, scrutinizing and questioning every move you make. The 
people I'm working with now trust my instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, the time-consuming schedule has necessitated his turning down 
lucrative offers from what used to be his main sources of income. The other 
day, he said, his agent had called to report an offer for a TV pilot. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually he was just as happy I turned it down, even though he's getting no 
commission on the Sajak show. As he put it, 'Listen, this show is doing more 
for your image, your recognition factor, than anything you could possible do 
elsewhere. Later on, it will be even easier for us to get jobs for you, on the 
strength of the reputation you're building now." 
</P>
<P>
And when might "later on" be? 
</P>
<P>
Scott smiled. "Frankly, I think I'm going to stay with this show as long as it 
lasts. I'm having a great time."

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine looking out your living room window and seeing the words lust, sloth 
and gluttony spelled out in 5-foot-high neon letters on a building across the 
street. Some neighbors of UC San Diego considered that prospect in October of 
1984 and didn't like it one little bit. 
</P>
<P>
It was bad enough that residents of La Jolla Shores Planned District had to put 
up with university traffic and construction problems and that the new Mandell 
Weiss Center for the Performing Arts intruded into their formerly sylvan view 
of the campus. To crown the massive rectangular building with a Bruce Nauman 
neon sculpture called "Vices and Virtues" was more than some neighbors could 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
News of the proposal to add a spectacular example of Nauman's work to the 
Stuart Collection -- a privately financed group of artworks sprinkled around 
the campus -- was greeted as a threat. "People were terrified of the fact that 
the art is words and that it is neon," said Hugh Davies, director of the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Acting out of "an irrational fear that had nothing to do with neon or art," 
some people seemed to believe that "Vices and Virtues" would "incite infidelity 
in the community," said Mary Beebe, director of the Stuart Collection. 
Detractors charged that the flashing artwork would cause automobile accidents. 
One man said he would have to change the route of his daily walk to avoid 
looking at the nasty neon words, Beebe recalled during an interview in her UC 
San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the controversy, La Jolla City Councilman Bill Mitchell called 
a press conference at the site and urged that municipal zoning ordinances 
prohibiting flashing signs be applied to the art. Though the laws cover neither 
university property nor art, he asked, "Why should an exception be made -- 
whether it's for Picasso or this guy?" 
</P>
<P>
Nauman's proposal had vocal champions. Edith Kodmur, a neighbor who owns a 
piece of neon art, contended that the neon would improve the "ugly" building. 
Davies, who lives near the university but doesn't have a view of the campus, 
offered to exchange houses with anyone who had a view but objected to the art. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the project were not impressed. Davies' offer, issued during a 
community hearing, was answered with a hiss from the crowd. In the interest of 
community relations, university officials decided to seek another site for the 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Now -- almost six years after Nauman completed his first drawings for the 
project -- a larger version of the originally proposed "Vices and Virtues" has 
been installed on the Charles Lee Powell Structural Systems Laboratory in the 
center of the campus, safely removed from neighbors' sight. Stories of heated 
exchanges during the controversy have faded into local history and acquired the 
flavor of quaint anecdotes. Meanwhile, the neon art has found such easy 
acceptance on campus that some of its supporters have difficulty recalling 
details of the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
A television crew that came on campus to film the finished piece had to "look 
far and wide to find anyone who didn't like it," said Lea Rudee, the 
university's dean of engineering, who says he is delighted to have "a 
world-class artwork in the engineering complex." 
</P>
<P>
Rudee also has something of an aesthetic wonder on his hands. Containing a full 
mile of neon tubing, "Vice and Virtues" may be the biggest neon sign in the 
country. (Most of the glittering spectacles on Las Vegas casinos are now 
electronic.) Like all artists whose works are in the Stuart Collection, Nauman 
was paid $20,000 for his effort. Total cost of the piece was $240,000, of which 
the National Endowment for the Arts contributed $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
An art aficionado who serves on the board of the Museum of Photographic Arts in 
San Diego, Rudee said that "greed" was part of his motivation in snaring the 
artwork for his bailiwick when it became clear that the theater location was 
doomed. But he has two other reasons for enthusiastically adopting Nauman's 
troublesome art. 
</P>
<P>
One is conceptual: "It is simplistic to assume that only the theater department 
deals with vices and virtues. In a technological society we have to confront 
these issues on a daily basis," Rudee said. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason is physical: The laboratory, located at the future hub of the 
campus, is far more visible to students than the theater, on a hill at La Jolla 
Village Drive and Torrey Pines Road. 
</P>
<P>
Every night from dusk until 11 p.m., "Vices and Virtues" performs for 
passers-by, patrons of the university library and anyone who happens to spot it 
from windows of the Scripps Memorial Hospital or the Marriott Hotel in 
University City -- among the few off-campus places where the work can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-foot-tall neon words run around a bank of windows at the top of the 
60-foot tall laboratory. Seven virtues and vices -- faith/lust, hope/envy, 
charity/sloth, prudence/pride, justice/avarice, temperance/gluttony and 
fortitude/anger -- appear in superimposed pairs. The virtues are spelled out in 
upright block letters that flash in clockwise direction. The vices circle the 
building in slanted letters, with words running counterclockwise. The virtues 
flash sequentially for three seconds per word in a cycle that starts every 
seven seconds. The vices move a bit faster, flashing at two-and-a-half seconds 
per word on a 5.83-second cycle. At periodic intervals, all the virtues or all 
the vices flash simultaneously for 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The overlapping cycles of flashing light and the fact that each word is 
composed of two colors in a palette of 11 hues results in seemingly endless 
variations and a constantly changing rainbow of color. Sometimes two or three 
words stand out like beacons; at other moments, a ribbon of superimposed 
letters and fluctuating colors streaks around the building and disappears into 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on 10-foot-tall glass panels, the words also shine through to other 
sides of the building, giving the whole parade a three-dimensional appearance. 
During twilight hours -- when most observers think the piece is at its best -- 
the words are subtle apparitions. As night falls, the building seems to slip 
away, leaving the bright words to float in dark space. 
</P>
<P>
Some people liken the neon-adorned laboratory to a modern cathedral with 
stained-glass windows. Others find deep meaning in momentary visions, such as 
the fact that gluttony seems to devour avarice or the way that the superimposed 
lust and faith blend into a word that looks rather like Faust. 
</P>
<P>
Nauman has issued "a moral reminder without being didactic or confrontational, 
and he uses the medium for getting that across in a truly subversive way," said 
Marcia Tucker, director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
For Tucker, who has shown Nauman's work at the New Museum and at the Whitney 
Museum of American Art when she was curator there, "Vices and Virtues" provides 
a perfect illustration of the difference between propaganda and art. 
"Propaganda tells you what to think. Art tells you to think," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You are inclined to make up a story from the flashing words, but you don't 
have time," Beebe said, watching the art from a nearby hill. One glimmer of 
insight tends to be superseded by another as the art runs through its 
computerized paces. 
</P>
<P>
The speed and repetition of the flashing neon lends a sense of urgency to what 
is actually just a familiar list of words. Like many of Nauman's other works, 
"Vices and Virtues" leaves viewers to unpack their own psychological baggage 
when they confront his art. He often selects a few spare elements that seem 
quite neutral or benign but set off reactions ranging from claustrophobic 
discomfort to poetic release. His 1969 "Live Taped Video Corridor," re-created 
last year at the Long Beach Museum of Art, makes participants feel as though 
they are walking away from themselves and into a grim prison of surveillance. A 
neon piece at the Baltimore Museum of Art, on the other hand, plays with the 
appearances and meanings of the words violins, violence and silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially a conceptualist, Nauman always appears to be more interested in 
meanings than in form, and the location of his public art often adds another 
layer to the conceptual context. Seen from the outside, the Charles Lee Powell 
Structural Systems Laboratory at UC San Diego is a plain, dark, rectangular 
building -- little more than a sleek, upright box. But inside is an unusual, 
open structure used for an activity of enormous consequence: seismic tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We can build a five-story building inside the laboratory," Rudee said. The 
only larger facility for testing earthquake loads, repairing structural damage 
and testing the repairs is in Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any significance in locating the neon here? "We like to say that the 
art is testing the pillars of Western civilization while the laboratory is 
performing earthquake tests," said Beebe, who has made a career of explaining 
difficult art and likes nothing better than to watch people learn to love the 
art they thought they loathed. 
</P>
<P>
She has previously smoothed the way to an unorthodox assortment of outdoor 
installations at the university: Niki de Saint Phalle's colorful fiberglass 
"Sun God," Robert Irwin's fence-like structure that mingles elusively with a 
grove of trees, stone sculpture by Richard Fleischner and Ian Hamilton Finlay, 
Terry Allen's "talking trees" (equipped with recorded music, poetry and duck 
calls), Nam June Paik's TV sets in a pseudo-archeological site and William 
Wegman's "photo opportunity" observation point, overlooking an ongoing parade 
of real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
In process are proposals by Jackie Ferrara, George Tracas, Jenny Holzer, 
Michael Asher, Maria Nordman and Alexis Smith. 
</P>
<P>
While few of the projects undertaken by the Stuart Collection are conventional 
artworks, Nauman's neon is the most complex to date, Beebe said. But she has 
few regrets, especially now that the controversy has disappeared and critical 
acclaim has taken its place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the most extraordinary pieces of public sculpture ever installed 
anywhere," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a brilliant piece," Davies agreed. He regrets that the neon is not a 
prominently located "beacon of the university" as it would have been on the 
theater. But he's pleased that the present site allowed the piece to be bigger 
than planned and that its placement on windows added three-dimensional life to 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
And what does the architect think? "It's terrific," said Leonard Veitzer, who 
designed the laboratory without a thought of neon. "Anything that makes a 
building more worthwhile" is desirable, he said. In this case "the scale and 
glass banding at the top" of his building made a "perfect background" for the 
neon. "I wouldn't like graffiti written all over the building, but this is a 
splendid piece of work."

COMPUTER CHIPS -- HIGH-TECH LOOT FOR BANDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY FARAH, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hooded thieves strike at night, heavily armed with machine guns and other 
weapons as they threaten security guards and barge into storerooms. 
</P>
<P>
Their loot: computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
A string of five such robberies at Orange County high-tech firms during the 
last six months have authorities concerned about a new breed of bandit as bold 
and brazen as jewel thieves, yet interested only in the tiny components that 
give computers their smarts. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think about the size of the chip and the value, the loss can be 
pretty significant to a company," said Bruce Baker, manager of program security 
at the Stanford Research Institute, a think tank that keeps tabs on computer 
crimes nationwide. "A person can walk off with a bag of chips that can have 
more value than diamonds or other gems." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the attacks have been limited to the Orange County area south of Los 
Angeles. Authorities in other high-tech areas of the country such as Boston, 
Dallas, San Diego and San Francisco report no similar thefts, although all have 
had incidents of employees stealing chips. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some authorities fear that the Orange County heists are a harbinger of a 
new, high-tech crime wave that is bound to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the crime of the 1990s," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Tony Castaneda, who is prosecuting three Pasadena men for reprogramming $1 
electronic chips for use in cellular telephones and reselling them for $100 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"This is high-technology stuff. It's the type of crime that's going to be 
prevalent in the 1990s, more sophisticated, more technological," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While gems are locked in safes protected by armed guards, chips have been more 
vulnerable, often stored behind mesh doors of less-secure businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent Orange County incident on March 3, four dark-clothed men 
toting machine guns, an assault rifle and a .45-caliber pistol struck Advanced 
Logic Research in the dead of night. Sticking one of the weapons to the head of 
a security guard, the intruders demanded entry to the Irvine computer firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They had stocking masks on, and they pushed him back into the building and 
made him open a door," said David Kirkey, the company's vice president of sales 
and marketing. "Two cleaning women ran upstairs and locked themselves in a room 
and screamed. The gunmen ran out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Report on Firm 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was stolen in the robbery attack, which coincidentally occurred a few 
days after Advanced Logic Research was featured in news reports for its 
development of a new computer. 
</P>
<P>
But on Jan. 3, two armed bandits made off with $105,000 worth of DRAMS, a type 
of computer chip, at Western Digital Corp. in Irvine after they bound the 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Orange County heists are similar, authorities believe two or three 
groups of look-a-like bandits are responsible, said Lt. Michael White of the 
Irvine Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Rosenblatt, a Santa Clara County deputy district attorney specializing in 
high-tech crimes, said it is no surprise the thieves are getting bolder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the times. People now have better access to assault rifles," he 
said. "But it's a stupid way to steal them (chips). It's sloppy. I know of much 
better ways, but I'm not going to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
The crooks are targeting two kinds of computer chips -- the kind used for data 
processing and those employed for memory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
As the chips become more sophisticated with greater capacity in less space, 
they become more valuable, computer experts say. They also are easier to steal, 
being the approximate size of a dime. 
</P>
<P>
"A megabyte chip (which is capable of holding 25,000 characters) costs about 
$10. A shopping bag full of 1,500 is worth $15,000. That's a lot of money," 
said John King, chairman of the UC Irvine's computer science department. 
</P>
<P>
"A new chip with tremendous amount of capacity can be worth multithousands of 
dollars," added Stanford's Baker. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the crimes frustrating is that the chips are hard to trace. They all 
look about the same and do not have serial numbers, only a stamped date of 
manufacture. That makes it harder for authorities to track the thieves and 
leaves legitimate businesses open to buying the stolen chips back without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"If you pulled a person over who had a grocery bag of chips, you couldn't tell 
where they got them from," UCI's King said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement and computer experts have varying theories on who the thieves 
are. They could be bandits hired by smaller firms to cripple a competitor; they 
could be the average robber trying out a new market, or they could be 
electronics experts who will either steal an expensive chip's design and sell 
it for a lower price or reconstruct a cheap imitation to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
That was the alleged motive in the Pasadena case where police said the illegal 
chip-encoding was responsible for more than $44,000 in outstanding phone bills 
for 137 different cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
California's largest chip theft case to date came in 1985. Larry E. Lowery was 
sentenced to six years in prison in Santa Clara County Superior Court for 
stealing $3.2 million in components from Silicon Valley's Monolithic Memories 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Baker thinks the new crimes will continue because there is a market for 
high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you have a high-tech market, you have a big market, either legitimate 
or black market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King, however, thinks the thefts are a "flash in the pan" because once 
businesses hear of the thefts, they will make their chips harder to steal. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think it's a bizarre thing to steal. But it's easier to conceal 
than an automobile and worth the same. It doesn't have anything traceable on 
it. And the first couple of times you do it, no one is expecting it," King 
said.

As a retired United States Navy officer, I want to remind the parents and staff 
at La Jolla Country Day School that there's a price for freedom. And the 
prerequisites are courage, honor and a deep respect for the well-being of your 
fellow man.

Mr. Burns, these are not qualities which a public relations firm can provide 
you. However, you can admit you made a mistake and return Sharon Rogers to her 
fourth-grade class.

I can't think of a better way of teaching our kids that our freedom is worth 
preserving.

LEPER COLONY CHIEF WANTS WORK TO GO ON AT NEW SITE

<P>
Leprosy treatment has come a long way since the days when victims of the 
disfiguring disease were forcibly detained here. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's disease can be treated almost exclusively on an outpatient basis now, 
and the director of the only leper colony in the continental United States 
plans to phase out the antiquated facility set up when victims were outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. John C. Duffy does not intend for the work of the Gillis W. Long 
Hansen's Disease Research Center to be lost as its buildings age along with its 
140 permanent patients, whose average age is 65. One outgrowth of leprosy 
research has led to help for diabetics, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research is outstanding, but our physical plant is a disaster," said 
Duffy, citing an Office of Management and Budget study. He wants to move the 
center's acute care, research and education functions to Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
The colony was opened in 1894 on a plantation when the state ferried five men 
and two women up the Mississippi River under cover of night from a New Orleans 
"pest house." The federal government took control in 1921 and as many as 500 
permanent residents were housed there during the 1930s. Most of the 330-acre 
complex of white, plantation-style buildings connected by a maze of enclosed 
walkways was built during the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very different patient population," Duffy said. "They were young, 
non-immigrant and they were mainstream Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Leprosy victims were arrested and forcibly detained here until after World War 
II when drugs were found that stopped the contagiousness and progression of the 
disease. Over time, fewer patients took up permanent residence. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which has treated nearly 3,000 patients, survived when the Reagan 
Administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals operated by the U.S. Public 
Health Service. The late U.S. Rep. Gillis W. Long spearheaded a drive to save 
it, but federal officials suggested research be done by either the Centers for 
Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
Leprosy, a bacterial infection, attacks the skin, flesh and nerves and is 
characterized by scabs, deformities and eventual loss of sensation. There are 
an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 U.S. cases, but up to 20 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to receive men, women and children with this disease. It's 
not an excludable disease," Duffy said. "You can have it, and you can come into 
this country. Because the incubation period is sometimes six to eight years, 
somebody can come into this country with no idea they have the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Research needs to continue at the center, he said. For one thing, the work 
takes hundreds of armadillos, the only nonhuman animal that gets the disease, 
and "there is no room at either CDC or NIH for the armadillos." 
</P>
<P>
"All the experts are here. They are not in Bethesda or Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
The center could take rental space in Baton Rouge without increasing its 
$18-million annual budget, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All major advances in leprosy treatment -- drugs, armadillo-related discoveries 
and two generations of vaccines with limited effectiveness -- came from 
Carville's researchers, said Duffy, who fears that research would be downgraded 
if it was moved to another agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the paradoxes of the disease that as far as scientists are 
concerned, their interest is almost always elsewhere than on this disease," he 
said. "It's not the kind of research for which you will win a Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the scientific community has paid scant attention to this 
disease. There is this group that has almost, in a sense, religiously dedicated 
their lives to this disease that are centered here." 
</P>
<P>
But even the worst cases discovered today can be handled through one of 11 
regional treatment centers or by private doctors. For example, a victim whose 
disease progressed while he was confined in a Cambodian prison is undergoing 
outpatient treatment in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Thalidomide, notorious for causing congenital birth defects, is one drug that 
controls the disease. The drug of choice is diaminodiphenyl sulfone, first used 
in leprosy treatment in 1941 by Dr. Guy Faget at Carville. Two other drugs -- 
rifampin and clofazamins -- have been tested successfully in recent years, and 
research continues because the bacteria are becoming resistant to sulfone 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
New admissions to Carville are mostly patients with reactions to the drug 
treatment or have diagnostic problems. After a few weeks, they go home. 
</P>
<P>
Research into the loss of feeling in hands and feet is being put to work for 
diabetics, who often require amputations after foot injuries stemming from the 
lack of sensation in their extremities. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 diabetics have been treated here for foot problems like ulcers with 
special casts that allow healing and mobility, said Dr. Charles Patout, chief 
of rehabilitation. "The techniques we've developed here could reduce the number 
of amputations among diabetics, about 50,000 a year, by 90%." 
</P>
<P>
Of the diabetics treated at Carville, only two have undergone amputations. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy would like to see more diabetics take advantage of Carville, but he 
admits that the stigma of leprosy may keep many patients from coming to the 
center. That is another reason to move treatment facilities to Baton Rouge.

COPING WITH TRAGEDY AT ORANGE GLEN HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Glen High School has had more than its share of tragedy this year. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher's aide and two former students were charged with murder, two students 
committed suicide and then an arson fire severely damaged the Escondido school. 
</P>
<P>
That's been hard on many of the school's nearly 2,000 students and has put an 
extra demand on the counselors. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the counselor most affected was Darwin Bree, a history and 
psychology teacher who also runs the school's peer counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
The popular teacher has been a focal point for students trying to cope with the 
tragedies because he teaches the students who serve as peer counselors. 
Further, his classroom was destroyed in the fire, and he lost 22 years of books 
and notes he used for classes. 
</P>
<P>
But he remained upbeat in the aftermath of the March 18 fire. Despite his 
personal loss, he continued to give solace to those in need. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, however, Bree realized he needed to get away, and he asked for 
a few days off to deal with his own loss. 
</P>
<P>
That may not be noteworthy in and of itself, but what is noteworthy is that 
Bree was willing to share those feelings with Times reporter David Smollar, who 
happened to be at the school. 
</P>
<P>
By sharing a little of how the losses had affected him and what he was doing to 
cope with the stresses, he may have helped others in the community. People he 
will never meet. People who may think that seeking help is a sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Through that moment of openness, Bree reached beyond the young people he helps 
every day, giving us a glimpse of someone practicing what he preaches. It's 
easy to see why he is so well respected at Orange Glen High School.

A CASE FOR REFORM OF PROP. 13 LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether San Diego County officials "purposely circumvented" Proposition 13 by 
getting the Legislature to allow a simple majority vote on a sales tax increase 
for jails and courts -- as a Superior Court judge recently ruled -- is a 
question of legal definitions best decided by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
But the circuitous route the Board of Supervisors took to get to this point 
illustrates the deteriorating condition of state and local government planning 
and financing, and should concern all San Diego County residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 citizens initiative that slashed property taxes may have saved 
Californians more than $115 billion in taxes in the past 11 years. But 
Proposition 13, along with the restrictions it spawned, has bled vital 
government functions, such as the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County jails hold more than twice their state-rated capacity, and 
thousands of people who should be incarcerated each year aren't. Even the 
approximately 1,600 jail beds that will be added over the next two years will 
be insufficient to meet current needs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans for jails to accommodate growth are stymied. Without 
additional revenue from local or state taxes, county officials have few 
realistic sources to replace the $1.6 billion the sales tax would have provided 
for jails and courts for the next 20 years. That sort of money can't be 
squeezed from current budgets, even if whole programs such as libraries and 
parks are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the Board of Supervisors has direct control over only a 
fraction of the $1.2-billion current budget. The remainder goes for such 
mandated programs as health care and legal defenses for the poor, many of which 
are also under-funded. 
</P>
<P>
The money also is unlikely to come from the state without additional taxes or 
bond measures, because Sacramento is in the same Proposition 13 mire. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the sales tax is upheld, however, only the immediate crisis is 
addressed. Until there is meaningful statewide reform of the Proposition 13 and 
spending restrictions, there will be one crisis after another with piecemeal 
solutions rather than rational long-term planning. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever way the lawsuit is decided, we hope that a byproduct of the challenge 
is to focus attention on the need for such reform and to build much-needed 
political support for it. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, then the delay caused by the suit might ultimately be worth 
it.

HEAT PATTERN BREAKS, COOLER DAYS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three-day streak of record-high temperatures that brought sweltering days 
to San Diego County this week ended Saturday, but unseasonal April warmth 
continued to send waves of people to the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth, consecutive record temperature was missed Saturday when the mercury 
stopped climbing at 80 degrees -- 2 degrees shy of the record temperature for 
April 8, according to Harvey Hastrup, a forecaster with the National Weather 
Service. The record of 82 degrees was set in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
After four straight 90-degree-plus days, Saturday's slight temperature drop was 
a welcome relief, even though temperatures remained far above normal for April. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been above the average every day so far," Hastrup said. Average April 
temperatures range from a high of 68 degrees to a low of 54 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in temperatures that began Saturday is expected to continue for the 
next several days, with temperatures returning to seasonal standards by Tuesday 
or Wednesday, Hastrup added. 
</P>
<P>
The current heat wave began Tuesday, when a high pressure system developed off 
the coast, pushing a blast of warm air into the Southland and blocking cooler 
sea breezes. As that pressure system moves eastward, temperatures should drop, 
Hastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
But until then, throngs of people are likely to continue heading to the 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 people stretched out in the sand at south Pacific Beach, 
according to lifeguard Matt Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like a fairly typical holiday crowd," Rowland said. "With the Santa Ana 
breaking down, it's been a little bit milder. We've even had some pretty thick 
clouds out here." 
</P>
<P>
The cooling trend should be more noticeable today , with temperatures expected 
to range between a comfortable 70 and 75 degrees at the beaches, forecasters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast, temperatures today may reach the 80s, with lows expected 
between 58 and 63. 
</P>
<P>
In the inland areas, the mercury is expected to climb into the 90s, with 
nighttime lows between 50 and 58 degrees. In the desert, however, temperatures 
could soar as high as 110 degrees, with lows between 64 and 72.

REFLECTIONS: 'I'VE SEEN DEATH MANY TIMES NOW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Caroline Lemke, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the fifth grade, when he first saw the "Emergency" television series, 
Tabo Saito knew he wanted to be a doctor. Everything in the life of the 
21-year-old biochemistry major at UC San Diego has been geared toward that 
goal. In addition to his full load at school, Saito volunteers from 8 p.m. to 
midnight Saturdays in the emergency room at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La 
Jolla. Saito has been at Scripps two years, observing all forms of ER 
techniques and assisting the nurses. Scripps is the third hospital he has 
worked at since he was 15. Saito said he learned about how to set priorities 
when he became a Boy Scout at age 12. He credits the Scout principles with 
keeping him on the right track. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed 
Saito at Scripps, and Kenneth K. Lam photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
My main job is patient care. I want to be there to support the patient because 
it may be his or her first time at the hospital, and they're pretty frightened. 
So I want to make them as much at home as possible. I want to sit down and talk 
with them, find out a little bit about them and make them feel comfortable. 
Aside from that, I'm making beds and helping out the nurses as much as I can. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday nights are fortunate for me because they're so busy. But, then again, 
if you look at it from a different point, from my age, I'm 21 and I should be 
going out to the bars and having a lot of fun. But I did all that in high 
school. I felt like, I think, I did a little too much. So I sat down and asked 
myself, "Where is my life going to go? I have to get serious now or forget it." 
</P>
<P>
I was just like a normal teen-ager. I raced, too, and have been on motorcycles 
without helmets. But here at the hospital, seeing the actual family suffering 
or seeing such a young life being wasted because of something careless or 
because of a drunk-driving incident, it just doesn't go over well. 
</P>
<P>
I'd have to say the hospital has matured me a lot. You see a lot of kids racing 
around the city, running around on motorcycles with no helmets, no shoes. I see 
the outcome of this carelessness, and it makes me realize what's going on. I 
think in that respect the hospital matured me because I think about it every 
time I do something or every time I'm about to do something. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic experience was my first night here. I had never experienced a 
trauma before. I had never seen death before. We had a trauma victim who came 
in from I don't remember where, but it was a gunshot wound. Thoughts were 
running through my head: "How am I going to take this? Am I going to faint? How 
am I going to feel? Is this really what I want to do?" 
</P>
<P>
I sat there and watched the patient come by and go into the trauma room. They 
activated the trauma team, and this swarm of physicians and medical aides came 
in and they worked like clockwork, like a team. They were trying to stabilize 
the patient because he had been shot in the head and a few other places. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't take it so bad. I didn't get sick or anything, or feel like leaving. I 
stayed there. I wanted to learn. It was interesting. At that point, I felt that 
none of the gore to it really bothered me. I took it from the standpoint, 
"Something is seriously wrong here. Let's do something about it." When you 
think that way, regardless of how bad the injury is, it makes it go by a little 
bit better. 
</P>
<P>
Things that upset me the most are young kids who waste their life needlessly or 
get their life wasted needlessly, because I feel they have a whole future ahead 
of them, and it's being taken away right here at this spot. I've seen death 
many times now. When you're sitting there watching someone who still has life 
in him just turn over, pass on, it's different because you are sitting there 
and watching it happen. It's not like television.

YANKEES APPEAR CLOSER TO THE BOTTOM THAN TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY NOBLE, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laps, wind sprints, calisthenics and hours in the outfield with Frank Howard. 
Oh, how the New York Yankees worked this spring! Sweat they did. No time -- 
much less energy -- left for golf. If perspiration were a guarantee of success, 
the Yankees' magic number would be a single digit by Aug. 1. It has been a 
taxing spring. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day for the Yankees was Tuesday, and the team is no more ready to meet 
its challenge than most of us are ready for the demands of April 15. Even with 
all their conditioning, the Yankees are in dreadful shape. And it has nothing 
to do with physical fitness. Seldom since the CBS-ownership era has a Yankees 
team begun a season with less legitimate hope for success. Seldom in the 
Steinbrenner era has a Yankees team been so poorly equipped. With the starter's 
gun about to deliver its message, the Yankees are more apt to win a sprint 
medley than a division championship. And there is every reason to believe they 
will be far behind the field before the gun lap begins. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad for Dallas Green and his carefully administered program. It might have 
worked if the Yankees had remained whole. After all, this was to be the season 
in which a team could steal the American League East championship, and Green 
was primed for grand theft. The division is without an outstanding entry. But, 
far from outstanding, the Yankees barely are standing at all. At this juncture 
-- without Dave Winfield, solid infield defense and a pitching staff that can 
offset those deficiencies -- the Yankees appear closer to the bottom than the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth place could be the Yankees' final resting place for the second successive 
season. But the 1989 deficit is bound to be far greater than the 3 1/2 games 
that separated the '88 team from the playoffs. The Yankees' victory total has 
decreased -- 97 to 90 to 89 to 85 -- in each of the last three seasons. This is 
not the time to expect a reversal. 
</P>
<P>
Examine the Yankees closely and you discover their total is less than the sum 
of their parts. The opposite is essential if a team is to overachieve. The 
personnel is not at all complementary. A pitching staff without strikeout 
expertise needs more than a doubtful double-play tandem. A team so dependent on 
left-handed pitching requires better left-side defense. A team with 
weak-hitting shortstops needs quality pinch hitters. The Yankees have two of 
the former and none of the latter. A team destined to see an inordinate number 
of left-handed starting pitchers needs right-handed power in the middle of the 
batting order, Steve Balboni notwithstanding. But with Winfield absent, Rickey 
Henderson, the leadoff batter, is the primary source of everyday right-handed 
power. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps the most damaging element is the depth. The Yankees are as thin as 
Kent Tekulve on the major-league roster, and their Triple A roster is almost 
translucent. If injury strikes another of the prime-time players, the Yankees 
will be reduced to a shameful level. 
</P>
<P>
What the Yankees do have is Green, whose brief history as a manager indicates 
an ability to elicit effort and positive thinking from his players, and a 
starting rotation that -- even with John Candelaria's rebellious right knee -- 
seems more durable than its immediate predecessors. And there are Don Mattingly 
and Henderson. But, to use one of Green's favorite phrases, what exactly do 
they bring to the party? 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees' hopes must rest primarily on the rotation. Green, who oversaw the 
overhaul of the staff, said, "The pitching is what will hold us together." The 
manager's words may have been more wishful thinking than confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Just the fact that Tommy John is the opening night pitcher says something. It's 
an inspirational story line of achievement and overcoming the odds, but Green 
maintained John's winning a position on the staff was more a function of how 
the other pitchers in camp performed. And no one was able to outpitch John. 
</P>
<P>
With Al Leiter still trying to equal his potential, Candelaria is the closest 
thing the Yankees have to a No. 1 pitcher. Candelaria has the ability to 
dominate opponents in three of every five starts. No other Yankees pitchers 
have that. But Candelaria has pitched 190 or more innings but twice in this 
decade and never since 1983. With that history and knee that may require 
regular draining, Candelaria may become the new Dock Ellis -- five and fly. 
</P>
<P>
If he does and John shows, as he did last season, a tendency to be markedly 
less effective -- or gone -- after the sixth inning, relief will have to be 
summoned early in at least two of every five games. The other three starters 
should provide more innings. Or should they? Leiter never has pitched 130 
innings in a professional season. The Padres swear Andy Hawkins' shoulder will 
give out sometime this summer, and Dave LaPoint's need for a fourth day of rest 
is one of the reasons Green will use a five-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The best-case scenarios for the three are these: With his own ability and Billy 
Connors' guidance, Leiter will blossom into a young, healthy Candelaria; 
Hawkins -- 12-6 in April and 42-52 thereafter -- will benefit from opponents' 
unfamiliarity with him, and LaPoint will be more effective than he was last 
season -- 3.25 ERA and 14-13 record in the season of the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen, often the club's undoing last season, should be stronger with 
Lance McCullers available to reduce the late-inning workload that appears to 
have eroded Dave Righetti's effectiveness over the years. Problem is McCullers, 
consistently the hardest thrower on the staff, was not too effective this 
spring, and the nasty habit he developed last season -- giving up home runs -- 
has followed him to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, unused for most of spring training, is a bit of a question. Then 
again, this team might not provide him as many leads to protect as other 
Yankees teams have. Dale Mohorcic and Lee Guetterman appear to be able set-up 
men. Richard Dotson, a reluctant reliever, is a spot starter and long man. 
</P>
<P>
The undeniable problem this staff presents is that McCullers, Leiter and 
Candelaria are the only genuine strikeout pitchers and Hawkins is the only 
right-handed starter. Left-handed pitchers are preferable, particularly in 
Yankee Stadium, and non-strikeout pitchers are acceptable if the defense behind 
them is reliable. But consider these potential problems: 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees ranked 13th in defense last season and have lost their most 
reliable infielder, Willie Randolph. What Randolph did best -- turn the double 
play -- is the greatest deficiency of his successor, Steve Sax. Sax still is 
tentative on pivots. Only the Astros turned fewer double plays than Sax' 
Dodgers last year, and that wasn't only because the Dodgers had a strikeout 
staff. Beyond that, Sax doesn't go to his right nearly as well as he goes to 
his left and is known to be reluctant to make throws from the other side of 
second base. 
</P>
<P>
All that puts greater emphasis on the shortstop and the left side in general. 
With Rafael Santana gone and Wayne Tolleson hurting, the shortstop is a 
27-year-old journeyman who thought he would be history by the first cut this 
spring -- Alvaro Espinoza. His chances of making the team were such that he 
wasn't even given his own locker in Florida. He had to share. 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza probably will share his by-default assignment as well, with Randy 
Velarde. And how confident will Velarde be now that he knows he couldn't beat 
out a player with 102 major-league at-bats and a .235 career average? Neither 
one is apt to hit much, so Green will need some pinch hitting. But the 
broadcast booths -- with Bobby Murcer, Lou Piniella, Tommy Hutton and Jay 
Johnstone -- may make for a better bench than what Green has available to him. 
</P>
<P>
Green was uncertain about his double-play combination when Santana -- quite 
skilled at delivering the ball to second base -- still was playing. "We won't 
turn the great double play," he said last month. Now what? Even when Tolleson 
returns, what then? 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pagliarulo, while he has impressed Green with his work ethic, has not 
impressed the manager with his quickness, and he doesn't play so far off the 
line to allow the shortstop to compensate for Sax. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the defense should be adequate to good. Mattingly owns Gold Gloves, 
Roberto Kelly might someday. Neither Don Slaught nor Jamie Quirk is a 
particularly gifted catcher, but they'll do. Henderson, if he chooses to, can 
play left field as well as anyone this side of Kevin McReynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's glove and arm work will be missed in right. But, of course, his 
absence will be most noticeable in the batting order, even with Balboni serving 
as the right-handed designated hitter. In the last two seasons, Balboni has 
been more productive against right-handed pitching (.233 average and 35 homers 
in 532 at-bats) than against left-handers (.199 average and 12 HRs in 267 
at-bats). 
</P>
<P>
Slaught will do some damage. But Tom Brookens, Pagliarulo's right-handed relief 
at third, and Balboni together won't provide what Winfield would have provided. 
And Green has deep doubts about Gary Ward. Mel Hall and Ken Phelps provide 
left-handed punch, but with Green forced to platoon in right, at third and DH, 
and to a degree, behind the plate, opponents can defuse the Yankees' 
left-handed starting batting order by replacing a right-handed starter with a 
left-handed reliever for one turn through the order. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents may stockpile left-handed pitching for visits to Yankee Stadium more 
than ever. What the Yankees need is for one of their platoon players, 
preferably Pagliarulo, to emerge as an everyday force. Otherwise, the 
hit-and-run will replace the home run as a primary weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Green has preached execution and identified it as a way to overcome other 
shortcomings, but a team has to put a man on third base with less than two outs 
before it can worry about scoring him. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what, the offense is likely to be too dependent on the top of the 
order. Henderson, Sax and Mattingly can do as much damage as any three-batter 
sequence. But there never are assurances Henderson will perform. With no 
Winfield or Claudell Washington to push him, just how much can be expected? Sax 
should be benefit from batting between Henderson and Mattingly. But what will 
Mattingly provide this year with diminished protection -- 30 home runs and 115 
RBI as he did in 1987 or 18 home runs and 88 home runs as he did last year? The 
Yankees will need as much as he can provide and more.

BISONS BULLISH THEY'LL DRAW MILLION FANS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN F. BONFATTI, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUFFALO, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Buffalo Bisons are trying to become the first minor-league team to draw at 
least a million fans in back-to-back seasons. But owner Bob Rich Jr., said 
they're not getting any help from the schedule-makers or the weatherman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 16 (home) games in April. That's going to put us a little bit more 
behind the eight-ball," Rich said prior to Wednesday's season-opener. "I think 
we'll have a better shot after we get through April of knowing if the million 
is do-able." 
</P>
<P>
The Bisons' American Association opener against the Louisville Redbirds 
illustrated Rich's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Snow over the weekend turned to rain earlier in the week. But temperatures 
remained around 40 degrees and, combined with a healthy breeze, helped make for 
a number of no-shows at 19,500-seat Pilot Field. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have inclement weather throughout April and it shuts down a bunch of 
games, it's really going to be tough because last year, we were 85% occupancy," 
said Rich. 
</P>
<P>
Still, 18,614 seats were sold for the opener and a season-ticket base of 9,000 
assures the team will sell at least 640,000 tickets this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Bisons set a single-season minor-league attendance record with 
ticket sales of 1,186,561. 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive promotions and the novelty of a beautiful new downtown stadium 
helped bring the fans in. But that loyalty didn't translate into on-field 
success. 
</P>
<P>
The Bisons, the Pittsburgh Pirates' top farm team, finished two games above 
.500, but were third in the four-team American Association East, 17 games 
behind division-winning Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Rich was clearly disappointed with the team's performance and vowed, along with 
the Pirates, to have a more respectable club this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pirates have really worked hard," Rich said. "They have a new organization 
evaluating new talent and they've worked hard to get us a winner." 
</P>
<P>
But Rich's first move was to lure Albuquerque Dukes manager Terry Collins out 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers' system to replace Rocky Bridges, a career 
minor-league manager whose low-key approach to winning angered Bison fans and 
Rich. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 39, was Manager of the Year in each of the past two seasons in the 
Pacific Coast League and led the Dukes to the PCL title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The most significant improvement over last year is the addition of Terry 
Collins," Rich said. "He's our kind of guy. The people here want to see 
athletes in all sports hustling and giving it their all." 
</P>
<P>
Collins admitted he took a career gamble in leaving the Dodgers organization, 
where he had been for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"To come over here is a challenge, and that's what I'm accepting it as; a 
challenge to go out and accomplish here what we accomplished the last couple of 
years in Albuquerque," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Rich made it clear to the Pirates he wanted some veterans to supplement 
Pittsburgh's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
So the Pirates went out and signed several players with major league 
experience, including 34-year-old Tito Landrum, 36-year-old Steve Henderson, 
33-year-old Jim Pankovits, 31-year-old Bill Scherrer and 38-year-old Rennie 
Stennett, who hadn't played baseball in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Landrum, Scherrer and Stennett didn't make it past spring training, but 
Pankovits will be Buffalo's second baseman this season and Henderson will play 
behind -- and tutor -- Pirates outfield prospect Steve Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who's got 10 years in the big leagues, he's got nothing else to 
prove, and yet if you watch him play every day, he plays like he's 23," Collins 
said of Henderson. "He's going to be a big asset to us all year." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the desire to win and the essentially developmental nature 
of minor league ball has soured many a relationship between a parent team and 
its farm club. 
</P>
<P>
But Collins said those two goals aren't necessarily incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things Pittsburgh -- and all of baseball -- is looking for is a 
winning player, a player who knows what it takes to win," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
A competitive team will help the Bisons as they shoot for another million fans 
at Pilot Field this season, which will in turn help Rich's goal of a major 
league team in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're going to see teams move out of existing cities, 
especially with the anticipation of expansion, which is so much more prevalent 
this year," said Rich, noting new baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti 
has listed adding two National League teams as one of his priorities.

IT'S BACK TO NORMAL FOR THE DURHAM BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DURHAM, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nuke LaLoosh and Crash Davis have cleared their lockers and moved out of Durham 
Athletic Park, and that means the real Durham Bulls are back to normal in the 
Carolina League. 
</P>
<P>
Normal for the Bulls, however, means overflow crowds at 5,000-seat Durham 
Athletic Park, even if Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon aren't still doing 
their roles from the movie "Bull Durham." Nonetheless, team officials say 
they're still reaping the benefits of last year's box-office hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be surprised if we don't draw over 200,000 again," Bulls owner Miles 
Wolff said following a preseason luncheon Tuesday. "The franchise is just so 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff apparently won't be surprised, based on fan interest prior to Friday 
night's opener against Frederick, Md., which used to be the Hagerstown team 
before moving. Durham is also celebrating its 10th year, and Wolff is pressing 
city officials on construction of a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as attendance goes, we've sold more season tickets this year than we 
ever have," Durham general manager Rob Dlugozima said Tuesday. "The advance 
ticket sales for opening night are ahead of what they've been." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, "Bull Durham" not only meant success for its producers. It 
provided a great summer for the real Bulls and now, they look forward to a 
real-life sequel. 
</P>
<P>
"What the movie did was make us a tourist attraction," Wolff said. "So many 
people would come from out of state and they wanted to come to a Bulls game 
because they'd seen the movie. So we're almost becoming a tourist attraction. 
If you come to Durham or the Triangle, you have to go by the ball park." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Bulls' souvenirs -- caps, T-shirts and jackets -- went so well last 
season that the team opened a second store in a Durham mall. It was expected to 
be a seasonal store that would cater to the Christmas shopper, but Dlugozima 
said the store is still open and will remain in operation for another year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls also are advertising their goods in a national sports publication and 
are awaiting more requests now that the movie has been released on 
videocasette. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who has a relative living in Durham asks them to get a Durham Bulls 
cap," he said. "I think that will continue through this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be just as exciting this year as it was last year," 
Dlugozima added. 
</P>
<P>
More encouraging than the upcoming financial outlook are the team's prospects 
on the field. Although the Bulls finished the year at 82-58, they failed to 
make the Carolina League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Grady Little says because of the glut of talent in the Atlanta Braves 
organization, the Bulls consider themselves a threat to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got a shot at it, as good a shot as any team that's ever been in 
Durham," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for Little's optimism is the response of the players who are moving 
to Durham for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the kind of club we've got and the kind of people they're going to 
play in front of, they come in with a smile on their face," Little said. 
"That's nothing but good for me."

STARLING PONDERS CAREER WHILE SHOULDER HEALS

The phone at Marlon Starling's home rings and rings but there is no answer. 
</P>
<P>
Ring! 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to fight Simon Brown?" 
</P>
<P>
Ring! 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to fight Mark Breland in June?" 
</P>
<P>
Ring! 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to move up in weight class, Ray Leonard's weight class?" 
</P>
<P>
Ring! 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to fight in Japan? Europe? Anywhere?" 
</P>
<P>
Starling has been laid low because of a shoulder injury that forced 
cancellation of a third battle with Breland and resulted in termination of a 
lucrative contract with Home Box Office. 
</P>
<P>
Starling is in physical therapy and considering the next step of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is he will fight sometime later this year, the earliest being late 
July or August," Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Though the loss of the HBO deal, which could have been worth $1.6 million to 
Starling, was a setback, it may be only a temporary one. Offers of other fights 
are being fielded by Starling's representatives, including another with Breland 
for June, which Starling has turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Cedric Kushner said Starling was unable to accept a proposal to fight 
Breland June 24 in a pay-per-view deal without medical clearance, which he 
wouldn't receive for another couple weeks at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Duva, president of Main Events-Monitor Productions, said without 60-day 
notice the pay-per-view deal could not be made and Breland probably would 
schedule another fight in June or July. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in reviving Starling-Breland, Sharnik said, is indicative of the 
position Hartford's World Boxing Council welterweight champion is in now. 
</P>
<P>
"Plenty of people are interested in putting him on," Sharnik said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharnik and Starling huddled this week to discuss the available alternatives. 
Sharnik said Starling could fight in Europe or Asia (possibly in a rematch with 
Japan's Fujio Ozaki) and that he has had inquiries from the camp of IBF 
welterweight champion Simon Brown about a match. 
</P>
<P>
Sharnik said Starling has established a $1 million price tag for "exceptional 
fights," including Breland, Brown and Julio Cesar Chavez. Other fights, such as 
a WBC mandatory title defense against No. 1-ranked Yungkil Chung, Ozaki or 
another top 10 contender is a possibility for a lesser purse. 
</P>
<P>
Sharnik said a pay-per-view deal is a good possibility and that Starling 
ultimately might make out as well or better than he would have with the HBO 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"He could fight for $600,000 or $1 million," Sharnik said. "Or, instead of 
fighting once for $600,000, he could fight twice for $300,000. He's a hot 
subject for pay-per-view. There's the (Tomas) Molinares knockout, he was 
(burned) by the WBA and then he comes back and decimates the unquestioned king 
of the welterweights." 
</P>
<P>
Kushner said he is still going to try to honor his agreement with Starling for 
a fight for $600,000 and then one for a million. 
</P>
<P>
Sharnik and Kushner said one of the considerations is having a fight in 
Hartford.

WHERE WILL MICHEL BERGERON COACH NEXT SEASON? QUEBEC? UNIONDALE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SMITH, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michel Bergeron, fired and replaced Saturday by Phil Esposito, said of next 
season, "One thing is for sure: I'll be coaching somewhere" in the National 
Hockey League. The question is, where? 
</P>
<P>
Quebec writers are lobbying for the Nordiques to rehire Bergeron, who had a 
243-222-79 record with them from 1980-87 and twice took them to the Stanley Cup 
semifinals. This year's Nordiques had the league's worst record (27-46-7), 
setting a club record for losses. They were 10-20-2 when Coach Ron Lapointe 
resigned after being stricken with cancer of the kidneys, and 17-26-5 under his 
replacement, Jean Perron, who has two years left on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
After Bergeron's firing, Nordiques GM Martin Madden said there is "no way" 
Bergeron will return next season. Nordiques spokesman Jean Martineau quoted 
Madden as saying of Bergeron, "We have no place for him." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeron's problem, insiders say, is that the Nordiques expect to undergo an 
Islanders-style youth movement. Alain Cote is retiring. Peter Stastny, Michel 
Goulet, Mario Gosselin, Robert Picard and Gaetan Duchesne are said to be 
available for trades. Bergeron is known for impatience with young players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do," he said. "When I decided to come here last 
year, it was a big decision. My family was behind me. And now, poof! They just 
fire me. They don't think about that. It's the shock of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to go on a vacation with my wife," said Bergeron, who could 
relax next year and collect the final year's salary on his Rangers' contract. 
"I'm thinking of not answering the phone because I don't want to distract the 
Rangers. I want the boys to win." 
</P>
<P>
He would not comment on where he thinks his next job will be. 
</P>
<P>
Uniondale? 
</P>
<P>
Kings Were Sick Before Loss: The Kings were without goalie Kelly Hrudey and 
left wing John Tonelli (both had the flu) for their 4-3 loss to the Oilers in 
Game 1 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey sat in the Forum dressing room in his pads in case Glenn Healy was 
injured. Healy (25-19-2, 4.27) played well despite not having appeared in a 
game since March 18. Hrudey (10-4-2) played 16 of the Kings last 19 
regular-season games after arriving in a Feb. 22 trade from the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Healy, just recovering from the flu himself, suffered dehydration after the 
game and was hospitalized. He was expected to back up Hrudey in Game 2 Thursday 
night. The Kings were said to be trying to sign their fifth-round 1988 draft 
pick, University of Minnesota goalie Robb Stauber. They recalled goalie Bob 
Janecyk from New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli also missed Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Messier on the Money: Edmonton's Mark Messier had a mediocre season -- for him 
-- with 33 goals and 94 points, but he was the best player on the ice Wednesday 
during the Oilers' come-from-behind win. He bumped and checked former teammate 
Wayne Gretzky, who had one assist for the Kings, and started the play that led 
to Craig Simpson's game-winning goal with 2:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
In Edmonton's march to four Stanley Cups in the past five years, Messier got 43 
goals and 70 assists in 77 playoff games. It will be up to Gretzky to outplay 
Messier if the Kings are to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Winds in Philly: A hot rumor is that Flyers owner Ed Snider has been 
burning up the telephone lines to Winnipeg, trying to arrange an off-season 
deal in which goalie Ron Hextall, a Winnipeg native, would go to the Jets in a 
package for Dale Hawerchuk. Jets insiders say the Flyers also are offering 
Scott Mellanby, who is in disfavor with Coach Paul Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say Philadelphia GM Bob Clarke and Hextall do not get along. By 
obtaining goalie Ken Wregget from Toronto on March 6 for two first-round draft 
picks, Clark might have been laying groundwork for next year, when Wregget 
could be the Flyers' starter, backed up by Mark Laforest. 
</P>
<P>
Cold, Hard Shoulder: Hawerchuk welcomed Soviet winger Sergei Priakin to the NHL 
this past Friday with an open-ice body check in the first period of the Jets' 
game against Calgary. Hawerchuk said later he does not appreciate a Soviet 
taking a job away from a Canadian-born player, and Montreal's Claude Lemieux 
made a similar remark. Said the Rangers' Ron Greschner: "I think we should 
leave the Russians where they are." Priakin, the first Soviet released to an 
NHL team, has not shown much and is not likely to dress during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhart Gets Back at Flames: It was ironic Paul Reinhart got the overtime 
game-winner for Vancouver Wednesday in its 4-3 upset win in Calgary. Reinhart, 
29, is the Flames' career playoff scoring leader with 72 points, but was traded 
to Vancouver last September after a chronic back condition limited him to a 
total of 122 games over the past three seasons. Reinhart played 64 games for 
the Canucks this year and had 57 points. 
</P>
<P>
Green Goalie Sees Red: Peter Sidorkiewicz (22-18-4, 3.03) took over from Mike 
Liut (13-19-1, 4.25) as the Whalers' No. 1 goalie this year. But Coach Larry 
Pleau started Kay Whitmore, who will be 22 Monday, in Montreal Wednesday. 
Whitmore led the AHL in games played with 56 but had three games of NHL 
experience. He was bombed, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my decision a couple of days ago," said Pleau, who kept it to himself 
until game time. "We wanted to try something different." Liut, 33, has a 25-27 
career playoff record. Sidorkiewicz has not played in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Another Whalers' note: Rookie Scott Young has been on ice for 15 of Hartford's 
league-high 19 shorthanded goals against, including one by Montreal's Ryan 
Walter, which proved to be the game-winner Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Klima Enjoys Late Success: The Red Wings' top line during the last month of the 
regular season was Adam Oates between Petr Klima and Dave Barr. It combined for 
all three goals in Detroit's 3-2 win over Chicago Wednesday. Klima, who served 
a few days in jail in December after his second alcohol-related arrest in 17 
months, scored 21 of his 25 goals in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Wings' insiders say Klima's season turned around after he spent several days, 
at a judge's direction, visiting patients at Detroit's Children's Hospital. "I 
can say I learned a lot in the hospital," Klima said. "I don't want to talk 
about it. I just started working hard in practice, I'm getting more ice time 
and that helps." 
</P>
<P>
Ready Malarchuk Waits: Goalie Clint Malarchuk has recovered from the skate gash 
on his neck he suffered in a March 22 game, but Sabres Coach Ted Sator started 
29-year-old Jacques Cloutier in his first career playoff game Wednesday. 
Cloutier responded by making 29 saves in Buffalo's 6-0 shutout in Boston, only 
his second shutout in seven seasons with the Sabres. Malarchuk was to have 
started Game 2 last night. 
</P>
<P>
Big Night for Brooke: Bob Brooke, who got all Minnesota's goals in its 4-3 
overtime loss to St. Louis Wednesday, had not scored since March 7. He had 
seven goals this season and has 57 in 374 regular-season games. The last time 
he played in the playoffs, with the 1986 Rangers, he had six goals and nine 
assists in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Exclamation Point Canadiens rookie Steve Martinson said of his club: "There's a 
tradition from the bottom up with everybody in the organization. A winning 
tradition. It's first class. They treat you real well, every way you could 
imagine, even the little things. It's all done first class. Even in camp, when 
guys come that might not have a future here, they treat them the same way. They 
say, 'You never know, five years from now, who's going to score the winning 
goal on a Stanley Cup team."'

THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE CALL AGAINST THE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On the morning after Michigan won the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
basketball championship, Steve Fisher's job status and Glen Rice's 
records-breaking performance were overshadowed by The Call Against The Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in retrospect, the most lasting memory from Michigan's thrill-a-minute, 
80-79 overtime victory over Seton Hall Monday night at the Kingdome. Forget 
Rumeal Robinson's baseline two-handed reverse dunk or the second-half duel 
between Rice (31 points) and Pirates guard John Morton (35). 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it all came down to lead official John Clougherty's call with three 
seconds remaining in overtime. Seton Hall point guard Gerald Greene was called 
for bumping Robinson, as the Michigan point guard appeared to be passing off as 
he drove in the lane. The Pirates were leading, 79-78. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I thought it was kind of weak to make that call at that time," said 
Robinson, who after a Seton Hall timeout made both ends of the one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I think referees take over the game," Robinson said. "I honestly 
feel if I was the referee, I probably wouldn't have called that. I would have 
let the play go on because there's only three seconds left. When you have so 
much riding on the game, why call that?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Greene, "It was one of those calls that could have gone either way. The 
ref made the call on me, so it was the right call. I didn't spend much time 
thinking about it. There were three seconds remaining and a lot of things could 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that Seton Hall forward Daryll Walker took a long inbounds 
pass from center Ramon Ramos, wrestled the ball away from Greene, turned and 
fired from 24 feet away. The ball ricocheted high off the backboard and into 
the hands of Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (30-7) had its first NCAA basketball championship. But Seton Hall 
(31-7), which had trailed by 12 points five minutes into the second half and 
had led, 79-76, following a three-point shot by Morton with 2:50 left in 
overtime, had won more respect than any losing team in recent Final Four 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were going to come back, because they did against Duke," said 
Michigan center Terry Mills, alluding to the Pirates' early 18-point deficit 
that turned into a 17-point victory. "They have showed a lot of character and 
class." 
</P>
<P>
So did P.J. Carlesimo. Unlike many coaches, who might have ranted about how the 
call cost his team the national championship, the Seton Hall coach displayed 
the same cool and class afterward that he had shown during the game. He blamed 
his team's defeat on its inability to hit some key free throws and makable 
shots down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our opportunities," said Carlesimo, whose team could have wrapped 
things up earlier, when Greene missed a crucial one-and-one with 1:13 left in 
overtime, and later, when two shots by Morton fell short. "They made the shots 
at the end and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
As for the officiating, Carlesimo said, "I'm not trying to be smart, but I 
thought it was a well-officiated game. John Clougherty is one of the best, if 
not the best, officials in the country. We couldn't have asked for anyone else 
we'd rather have make the call when the game is on the line than John 
Clougherty." 
</P>
<P>
Of the call, one veteran official with extensive NCAA tournament experience 
said, "First of all, no matter what anybody thinks, it's in the eye of the 
beholder, and in this case, the official is the eye of the beholder. When that 
call was made, it looked as if Robinson was going to the basket and the bump 
caused him to pass off. 
</P>
<P>
"You could argue from now until doomsday. You get 10 people, and five will say 
it was a good call and five will say it wasn't. For a good official, it's not a 
tough call. You want to be consistent for 40 minutes. If you make that call in 
the opening seconds, you make it in the closing seconds."

CARLESIMO SHOWS HIS CLASS AFTER LOSING NCAA TITLE 
</P>

<P>
This is the kind of guy Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo is. Minutes after what 
had to be the most heartbreaking defeat of his career, an 80-79 overtime loss 
to Michigan in Monday night's National Collegiate Athletic Association 
championship game, P.J. was being escorted from the interview room by 
Connecticut Sports Information Director Tim Tolokan. 
</P>
<P>
As P.J. walked off the podium and down the blue curtained hallway behind the 
interview room, he and Tolokan passed the closed door to the Michigan dressing 
room. P.J. asked Tolokan when the Michigan players and interim coach Steve 
Fisher would be coming out to go to the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three minutes," Tolokan told him. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches who had just gone through what Carlesimo had wouldn't have even 
bothered to stop or ask. And of the few who would have, even fewer would have 
waited a split second when told that their conquerors wouldn't be coming out 
for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But P.J. Carlesimo hung around. And when the door finally opened, and three of 
the victorious Michigan stars emerged on their way to the interview room, 
Carlesimo congratulated each of them. He hugged Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
People like P.J. are winners no matter how many games they lose. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Michigan's Fisher may prove to be a loser even though he won, 
coaching Michigan to its first national championship in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he won, had a great six-game tournament run. But Michigan athletic 
director-football coach Bo Schembechler wonders, when all's said and done, if 
Fisher's tough enough. Isn't that just like a football coach? 
</P>
<P>
You probably know the story by now. Fisher, 44, a Michigan assistant coach for 
seven years, was named interim head coach by Schembechler on the eve of the 
NCAA Tournament, almost immediately after head coach Bill Frieder had told Bo 
he'd accepted a job at Arizona State next season. 
</P>
<P>
Bo is a no-nonsense guy, and besides, he never liked Frieder much, anyway, so 
he told him to hit the road immediately. 
</P>
<P>
With Michigan coachless and the tournament set to begin, Schembechler called 
the basketball team together and told them to go as far as they could in the 
tournament and not worry about the coaching situation. 
</P>
<P>
He told them he would not name a new head coach until the tournament was over 
and the players were back on campus, at which time Bo said he would meet with 
them individually to get their thoughts on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder, a basketball fanatic whose intensity and tunnel vision were legendary 
even in a profession where such behavior is the rule, was not particularly 
popular with his players. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, however, that would not necessarily be a bad rap. Players, 
19-year-olds, are rarely the best judges of what kind of coach is best for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it illogical that Michigan, in the short run, would play its best ball 
for Fisher. By the very nature of their positions, assistant coaches are often 
more buddy-buddy with their players than the head coach is. In an NCAA field 
with so many evenly matched top teams and none that was absolutely awesome, an 
emotional edge can catapult a team to a championship. 
</P>
<P>
But given that Michigan began playing its best basketball of the season when 
Fisher replaced Frieder, how can Bo deny Fisher the job? How do you fire an 
undefeated coach? 
</P>
<P>
It all depends who else Bo can get. That, more than anything else, may 
determine whether he removes "interim" from Fisher's title. 
</P>
<P>
One point can't be argued: Given the tournament result, it's a public relations 
disaster for Michigan if Bo, who has never won a national football championship 
in his 19 years at Michigan, doesn't give Fisher the job. But like most public 
relations disasters, it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
One of the toughest things for any boss, especially one in the public eye, is 
to make a decision that kicks public opinion in the face. We know that the 
players like Fisher, that they play hard for him. But how good a recruiter is 
he? In college basketball, 1989, there's a much greater correlation between a 
coach's record and his ability to recruit blue-chip players than his ability to 
actually coach them. 
</P>
<P>
Which may be a good thing for Fisher. Because if Monday night's championship 
game was any indication, he isn't much of a bench coach. 
</P>
<P>
When guard Rumeal Robinson made a rip-roaring reverse dunk to give the 
Wolverines the biggest lead of the game -- 51-39 with 14:17 left in regulation 
-- it behooved the Wolverines to use as much of the 45-second clock as they 
could on each possession. It wasn't as if this would have forced them to alter 
their style: They were already employing a half-court offense and dominating 
the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Wolverines hurried shots and passes, playing as if they were using 
the NBA's 24-second clock, as if they were the team trailing by 12. They helped 
Seton Hall get back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Their worst offender was sophomore Sean Higgins, who made only 2 of 7 
field-goal attempts in the second half, 3 of 10 for the game, many of them 
wild, ill-advised attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Fisher is a little more relaxed," Higgins said after Michigan beat 
Xavier in its first-round game. "He gave us more freedom. If we'd make a 
mistake, he'd say 'That's OK, do it right the next time.' Coach Frieder would 
have just pulled us out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Someone should have pulled Higgins out of this game. Someone should have gotten 
Michigan to run a more patient offense. Someone should have settled the 
Wolverines down as they set about blowing the game, a fate from which Glen Rice 
(31 points) and Robinson's clutch free throws with three seconds left in 
overtime saved them. 
</P>
<P>
That someone should have been Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say Bo shouldn't make Fisher Michigan's head coach. There are 
more than a few successful college basketball programs run by coaches who can't 
coach a lick. 
</P>
<P>
But very few run by coaches who can't recruit. Michigan is a big-time school 
with a big-time name. Is Steve Fisher good enough to keep its banner flying 
high? Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
He certainly seems to deserve the chance. 
</P>
<P>
What the heck. Bo can always fire him.

DOWNTOWN LANDMARK PURCHASED; 
</P>
<P>
IRA YELLIN, PARTNERS, TO SPEND $4 MILLION TO RESTORE VENERABLE BRADBURY 
BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Ira Yellin's dream to make Broadway the focal point of downtown took 
another step toward reality last week with his purchase of the historic 
Bradbury Building, owned by the McKelvey family since 1943. 
</P>
<P>
The 96-year-old city landmark at 304 S. Broadway, across the street from 
Yellin's recently purchased Grand Central Market and the Million Dollar 
Building, closed escrow last Monday for slightly more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Monument Forever' 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to keep the Bradbury a monument forever and will do major work, 
cleaning up the facade and the interior so it will be a polished gem when we're 
finished," Yellin said, estimating restoration cost at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Alexander, one of Yellin's partners in the deal and his roommate at 
Harvard Law School 25 years ago, said that although ground-floor retail space 
is leased, offices in the five-story building have been empty for 18 months 
while seismic work was being done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elevators to Remain 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we'll do the interior with remodeling to be consistent with the 
building's historic nature," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
The old caged elevators in the Romanesque-style building, designed by George 
Wyman, will remain, he said, "because they are like experiencing Europe in 
downtown L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The elevators, bathed in light filtered through a skylight, and the lace-like, 
wrought-iron railings in the building have attracted many film makers over the 
years. The 1982 movie "Blade Runner" was shot there. 
</P>
<P>
The charm of the Bradbury, named for Lewis Bradbury, the mining 
millionaire-turned-real estate developer who built it, made it difficult for 
the McKelvey family to sell the building, said family member Dale Dougherty of 
Western Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandfather started this company in 1934," he said, "and the Bradbury Building 
was his first major investment. Everybody in the family is getting up in years, 
and they agreed three years ago to liquidate all holdings, but some wanted to 
sell the Bradbury, and some didn't. Grandfather had the final say." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opportunity to Buy 
</P>
<P>
Yellin said, "I was fortunate they came to me once they decided to sell and 
asked if I wanted to buy the Bradbury, saying they would give us the 
opportunity before they went public to market it. I went into escrow with two 
friends." They were Alexander, a Century City attorney and member of the 
Beverly Hills City Council, and Jim Neal, an investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest obstacle was the timing," Neal observed. Escrow closed on the 
Million Dollar Building on Dec. 30, and escrow opened on the Bradbury in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"During the last month," Yellin said, "we met (local attorney) Sydney Irmas and 
his wife, Audrey, who love architecture and design. They became our financial 
partners." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Grand Central Square' 
</P>
<P>
Now Yellin and various partners control three of the city's most important 
landmarks, which they are refurbishing to be part of what he calls "Grand 
Central Square," with upscale restaurants and offices filled with lawyers, 
politicians and consultants spilling over from the Ronald Reagan State Office 
Building, being built at 3rd and Spring. 
</P>
<P>
Yellin, who helped form a nonprofit group of merchants and developers known as 
"Miracle on Broadway," admits that Grand Central Square is a lofty idea, since 
many offices on Broadway are empty, but said: 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Baltimore or other cities with a lot of urban renewal, you 
will see that it's the historic buildings that make a city a place where people 
want to walk around. We have that kind of potential in this part of town."

LEADER OF NAMIBIA REBELS ORDERS TROOP WITHDRAWAL 
</P>

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma, in a move that could salvage Namibia's imperiled 
independence process, called on his 1,900 soldiers in northern Namibia late 
Saturday to stop fighting, regroup at U.N. assembly points and withdraw across 
the border into Angola within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma's plea came on the eighth day of bloody battles between his South-West 
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) rebels and South African-backed police and 
soldiers. At least 289 SWAPO guerrillas and 27 police and soldiers have been 
killed in the fighting, which began with a SWAPO invasion only hours after the 
U.N.-sponsored peace plan for Namibia got under way on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come to this difficult decision because we are aware of the historic 
responsibility that we have to our people and to humanity as a whole," Nujoma 
said in a statement issued from SWAPO's exile headquarters in Luanda, Angola. 
</P>
<P>
"SWAPO and the Namibian people have nothing to gain by further loss of lives 
and the collapse of the U.N. independence plan for our country," Nujoma added. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, leader of the 24-year bush war against South African rule here, said 
the guerrillas should be escorted -- with their arms -- out of Namibia by the 
U.N. peacekeeping force here. He called on the force -- the U.N. Transitional 
Assistance Group -- to select assembly points in northern Namibia for the 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma made his appeal as senior diplomats from Angola, Cuba and South Africa 
began emergency talks under camouflage tents at a safari lodge north of 
Windhoek in an attempt to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO was not represented at the talks, and it was not clear what prompted 
Nujoma's announcement. But Chester A. Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of 
state for African affairs, and Anatoly Adamishin, the Soviet Union's deputy 
foreign minister for Africa, had met with SWAPO officials in Luanda on Friday. 
Both Crocker and Adamishin were observers at the meetings Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma's orders to his troops came amid increasing international criticism of 
SWAPO, which had for years enjoyed widespread support outside Namibia. In the 
past week, the United States and other countries have sharply criticized SWAPO 
for infiltrating Namibia in what the State Department called "a clear 
violation" of the agreements that SWAPO had signed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the United Nations' amended peace plan for Namibia, SWAPO guerrillas were 
to remain confined to bases north of the 16th Parallel, about 150 miles inside 
Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
A U.N. resolution, and later accords signed by South Africa, Cuba and Angola, 
call for SWAPO to remain restricted to those bases in Angola until mid-May, 
when unarmed guerrillas will be allowed to return to Namibia through entry 
points monitored by the U.N. peacekeeping troops to participate in the 
territory's elections. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa says about 1,900 insurgents, most of them in small groups, 
remained in northern Namibia on Saturday. Most of the rebels were in thick bush 
south of a 180-mile stretch of the border. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas were being pursued by 3,500 troops and counterinsurgency police 
officers. Police said that an additional several thousand SWAPO guerrillas were 
poised just across the border in Angola, and the infiltrations continued 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma had maintained that his fighters were in Namibia before the April 1 
cease-fire. But the United Nations, as well as the State Department and South 
Africa, has said SWAPO invaded the territory after the cease-fire began. 
</P>
<P>
Captured rebels have said they were ordered to enter Namibia, many of them in 
new uniforms and heavily armed, to establish bases. They also said they were 
told that they would meet no resistance because South African forces were 
confined to bases and, if they did meet resistance, the U.N. peacekeeping 
troops would protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats say the invasion appeared to have been an attempt by Nujoma 
to declare his fighters victors and show their supporters that SWAPO's 
guerrilla war against South Africa had not been in vain. Nujoma had agreed to 
the provisions of the U.N. plan earlier this year in a letter to the U.N. 
secretary general. But he was said to be unhappy with the small role SWAPO 
leaders played in the negotiations for Namibian liberation. 
</P>
<P>
The SWAPO invasion baffled U.N. officials and diplomats because SWAPO, with 
substantial support in the north, is considered the likely winner of the 
U.N.-monitored elections in November. Analysts doubt, though, that SWAPO will 
obtain the two-thirds majority necessary to write the new constitution by 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-mediated pact signed by Angola, Cuba and South Africa in 
December, Cuba agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from Angola, and South 
Africa agreed to allow the United Nations to implement its 11-year-old plan for 
Namibian independence. 
</P>
<P>
That plan, administered by South Africa "to the satisfaction of" the U.N. 
special representative, establishes a complex timetable for the return of 
exiles, the beginning of political campaigns and the departure of South African 
troops here. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. plan was threatened on the day it was to take effect when hundreds 
of SWAPO insurgents streamed into Namibia. U.N. peacekeeping troops based in 
Angola were to have monitored SWAPO's compliance, but they did not, for reasons 
that remain unclear. 
</P>
<P>
To stop the insurgents, the U.N. granted South Africa permission to release 
1,500 of its troops from bases to assist police. 
</P>
<P>
The original U.N. plan had called for peacekeeping troops to be stationed along 
the Angola-Namibia border to prevent infiltrations, but that provision was 
eliminated when the United Nations reduced its planned 7,500 troops to 4,650 to 
save money. Wrangling over the cost of the operation also caused a delay in 
deployment, and fewer than 1,000 of the troops had arrived by April 1.

VISIONS OF HOLINESS IN LUBBOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
From the mists above and a hunger within, Theresa Werner thought she saw God. 
He seemed so much like the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
His hair was white and his eyes were fire. The rumble of his voice was at once 
a comfort and a fright. "Convert your ways, for time shall erase all men's 
memories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that was just the once. Other days it was the Virgin Mary who spoke to her. 
Our Lady lamented the sinners and warned of chastisements. In her diary, 
Theresa wrote: Can this really be happening? I am so unsure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maybe They Were Delusion 
</P>
<P>
It seemed crazy to repeat. Why would God and Mary talk to a country girl like 
her, anyhow? Maybe the voices were just something that came naturally out of 
herself or her prayers -- or maybe they were a delusion. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they sounded so real. And, after all, why shouldn't the Lord reach out to 
her, smoothing away the doubt? People want more than Bible-story miracles from 
way back where and when. Why not here and why not now? 
</P>
<P>
For Theresa, as for so many others, religion too often seemed a long passageway 
without a door. She needed something to grip onto -- God actually beside her in 
this life as he would be in the next. 
</P>
<P>
And now she thought she might have been chosen for her very ordinariness. She 
wanted to be sure and so she asked for signs. Once, a voice circled the kitchen 
as she mopped the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that you, Mary?" she questioned. Then she lit candles and prayed for the 
poor souls in purgatory. The room rapidly filled with the fragrance of roses. 
Mary! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensing Mary's Presence 
</P>
<P>
The voices were nothing to keep to herself. Theresa told her priest, Msgr. Joe 
James, and he was not surprised. He and many others at St. John Neumann's 
Catholic Church in Lubbock thought they were sensing Our Lady's presence. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa, actually, was only one of three to receive messages. Mike Slate and 
Mary Constancio got them, too. They wrote down each word during Monday night 
rosary sessions in the chapel, like dictation from heaven. 
</P>
<P>
What if this is all in my head? Theresa continued to fret. Msgr. James tried to 
reassure her: Don't be so concerned about what's true and what's not. That will 
be understood soon enough. By their fruits ye shall know them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet during the last year the fruits have not been so easy to sort -- amid the 
passions of the zealous and the disapproval of the bishop and the scrutiny of a 
formal investigation by church experts. 
</P>
<P>
News of the messages, like so many reports of visions, weeping statues and 
heavenly images on someone's table top, became a spiritual magnet. 
</P>
<P>
Busloads came to see and hear for themselves -- upward of 15,000 pilgrims on 
one day last summer, for maybe the sky had finally opened with answers. 
</P>
<P>
To the regulars at St. John's this all seemed a great puzzle. What the heck was 
going on? Had Theresa and the others made some wondrous connection with the 
divine -- or merely inhaled the desperate breath of their own imaginations? 
</P>
<P>
It is those questions that have split a parish of 250 families. To this day the 
chasm waits to be closed, here in the cotton-daubed plains of the Texas 
Panhandle, all in the fullness of time. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Werner, a 34-year-old farmer's daughter, grew up in Nazareth, just up 
the road from Tulia and Plainview and Lubbock. The town is mostly Catholic, a 
rarity hereabouts where people are more inclined to be Baptists. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa was always the bashful girl. Her long, auburn hair seemed combed to 
hide her face. She liked to be alone, off in her room or up on her horse. 
</P>
<P>
God was a powerful presence in her young life. One overcast day, she was 
skinny-dipping in the swimming hole, even though she knew that wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, she sensed the Lord above, ready to zap her. The clouds seemed to 
drop down and start to churn. Theresa scooted off in a fright until at last 
reason took hold. Why run? Fast as you go, you can never get away. 
</P>
<P>
God was at school, too. The nuns invoked his name. Pay attention or they got 
out the paddles. They taught about virtue and sin, heaven and hell. It was 
beautiful and scary and mysterious, all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stories About Blessed Mother 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most wonderful stories were about the Blessed Mother. Mary remained 
a virgin even though she gave birth to Jesus. God spared her all sin, and in 
death she was taken up body and soul into heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the goodness! In her mercy, the Holy Virgin was really the mother of 
everyone who wanted the light of her son. Pray to her, and she answered. She 
was to be hailed: Mary, full of grace. ... 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she even appeared to people right before their eyes. Through the 
ages, hundreds have thought they have seen her, roses at her feet and a white 
glow above her head. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, who can say for sure? It is a good thing the Catholic Church uses 
its authority to judge the real from the unreal. Only a handful or so of the 
visions have been approved. Shrines go up where they took place. 
</P>
<P>
Millions each year visit Guadalupe in Mexico or Fatima in Portugal or Lourdes 
in France. Theresa herself tingled at the thought of them, though the 
fascination would pass. Religion can get to be a little confining. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Turn for the Wild 
</P>
<P>
As Theresa grew older, she took a turn for the wild. Catholicism went up on a 
shelf like a can of preserves, there for later if she had a craving. And that 
would come on and off. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, she got married. Mark Werner was in Alaska, working the pipeline. He 
put an ad in one of those weekly papers: "Man, 31, earns a good living. Loves a 
good family life." They became pen pals before they became lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, here in Lubbock, Mark is a baker at a cafeteria, a not-so-hot job 
with odd hours. There are strains. He and Theresa have a small son to care for 
and not enough money to do it the way they would like. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of it is, sometimes they seem headed for the Big D. Theresa heaved a 
jar of cold cream at Mark's head, and it was a lucky thing he got a hand up. 
</P>
<P>
Religion soothes some of that. In prayer, time seems to melt away. People so 
often are adrift within themselves, and the aimless motion never stops until 
they know God as their compass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Holding Jesus' Heart' 
</P>
<P>
One night, Theresa had a vision of the dove of the Lord descending in a shaft 
of light. "Just then, Mark and my hands are on fire," she wrote in her diary. 
"We are holding Jesus' heart now in our hands." 
</P>
<P>
They could sense a sacred and eternal flame, like the splendor of salvation 
reaching out from the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Lubbock is a sprawl of homes and shopping plazas, more new than old, grown now 
beyond the Loop Highway that once hemmed it in from the surrounding cotton 
fields. Little is spectacular but the big sky above. Sunsets are a real show. 
</P>
<P>
The population is 211,000. Although that number stays pretty much the same, the 
residents come and go, stationed for a time at Reese Air Force Base or enrolled 
at Texas Tech University. 
</P>
<P>
There are seven Catholic churches here, and people pick the one they want for 
proximity or just because they like it. Of these, St. John Neumann's is known 
for its odd-looking building and its eccentric goings-on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partially Underground 
</P>
<P>
The church is constructed partially underground, the contours of its lawn 
sloping up to become both an outside wall and a roof. Much of the design -- 
like the goings-on -- is owed to Joe James, 57, the founding pastor. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, is a small-town Texan, handy with machinery. That would be him making 
the repairs on the wind generators, those big white whirligigs that hover above 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
The monsignor lives at two speeds, neutral and fourth gear, one day sullen and 
morose and the next day all revved up. He won't be found with the other priests 
at the Tuesday golf game. 
</P>
<P>
Those others don't have much interesting to say, anyway. So many these days 
have intellectualized religion. God would have to write them a personal letter 
before they would even believe in the Resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the way of Joe James. He is anything but a career-man church 
bureaucrat. His whole life is a reach for the divine: the feel of it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charismatic Spirituality 
</P>
<P>
He embraces what is often called a charismatic spirituality, a more fervent 
prayer life that in recent years has found a place in nearly every Christian 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
God makes himself known to us in dreams and visions and passages of Scripture 
that come to life. He bestows gifts of the Holy Spirit, or charisms, among them 
the powers of prophecy and healing. 
</P>
<P>
To James, Catholicism has a spontaneous, hand-clapping, Pentecostal flavor. And 
at St. John's, a few of the flock lay their hands on the heads of the sick and 
even speak in tongues. 
</P>
<P>
This is not for every Catholic, and turnover is high. Some of that owes to 
Lubbock's transient nature. Then, too, plenty have quit after run-ins with the 
monsignor, who can be an angry and quarrelsome man. 
</P>
<P>
He is tired of all those smorgasbord Catholics, picking and choosing. You need 
to pray! And tithe! After all, religion demands as well as provides. And anyone 
who does not understand that can leave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went on Rome Sabbatical 
</P>
<P>
Oh, my, people have said often enough. If only there was a way to put out that 
fire and just keep the warmth. Then early last year that appeared to happen. 
Joe James went away on a sabbatical to Rome and came back changed. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, he made two pilgrimages to the mountain hamlet of Medjugorje 
in Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands have made the same difficult journey since 
1981, when six children there began seeing the Holy Virgin. 
</P>
<P>
The apparitions, as yet unapproved by the church, have been likened to miracles 
like Lourdes -- part of the seamless continuity of Mary's message of peace and 
faith and conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims sometimes describe the sky ablaze with shapes and colors: the sun in a 
dance of spinning and pulsation. Msgr. James saw none of that, but he did 
somehow come away with the certain knowledge that Mary is real. 
</P>
<P>
That gave fresh meaning to the rosary prayers that had become trivial to him 
with repetition. Here is truth, he told himself: The Holy Virgin delivers to 
the open of heart an oasis of understanding. 
</P>
<P>
And, not incidentally, he was cured of his hypoglycemia. 
</P>
<P>
Mary is more than a mere statue! Joe James proclaimed when he got back in 
February, 1988. She aches for us to give glory to her son. She wants us to fast 
twice a week and pray three hours a day. Take this seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows how many did? At the Sunday night prayer meeting, only five came. Joe 
James himself was tired and would have gone home but for an inner voice 
reminding him: Where two or three are gathered in my name I am there. 
</P>
<P>
His pride made him ashamed. He told the others of it, and they dropped to their 
knees. It was then that the monsignor felt the presence of the Virgin, walking 
in the room and placing her gentle hand on each person's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Agnes Klein lit with it, too. She could not see Mary's face, "as it was more of 
an outline." But she did sense Our Lady moving about -- a foot off the floor 
and wrapped in white. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smelled Roses in Chapel 
</P>
<P>
The following Sunday, several people smelled roses in the chapel where there 
were no flowers at all. Could it be perfume or air freshener? Everyone began to 
sniff around. 
</P>
<P>
"In my spirit I knew it was the presence of the Blessed Virgin," Richard Wood 
concluded. And Msgr. James agreed. It was the same scent he had smelled beside 
the Mountain of Apparitions in Medjugorje. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, at the regular Monday rosary session, an unusual serenity 
settled over Mary Constancio. In her mind's eye she saw the Virgin. Then she 
heard the kindest of voices, melodic as song. 
</P>
<P>
"Pray three rosaries a day and within six months you will see much conversion," 
Our Lady told her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awakened by Voice 
</P>
<P>
And the night after, as Mary Constancio slept beside her husband, Henry, the 
same tuneful voice awakened her: 
</P>
<P>
"Go and tell your priest and go and tell your bishop that Mary your mother has 
come to give a message: That they should spread her word . . . come and say the 
rosary with me on Monday nights . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Times before, Mary Constancio, 34, had felt the finger of God pointing the way 
-- with a premonition or an answered prayer. But this was so much more vivid 
and rapturous. She shook Henry. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blessed Mother is speaking to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, OK, that's good," he answered and rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
She got up and scribbled the Virgin's words in one of her son's composition 
books. Then she began phoning friends in her prayer group, right then, in the 
middle of the night. Yes, it is so. Our Lady is with us. 
</P>
<P>
Praise God, Joe James said. And praise God people did. After all, this was Mary 
Constancio, trustworthy mother and wife, a respiratory therapist at the 
hospital and nobody's idea of a kook. She was hearing from the Holy Virgin! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sparsely Attended 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Monday rosary session had been sparsely attended. Three couples 
had started it and they often were the only ones there -- the beads sliding 
through their fingers, their prayers a rapid mumble. 
</P>
<P>
But soon there were 30, then twice that, then more. They came to hear the 
Virgin speak through her messenger, and each Monday there were beautiful new 
words. "Blessed children of God . . . my heart is burning with love for you . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
It was as if all the barriers were dissolving between here and eternity. So 
much of what Our Lady asked of them were the same things Joe James had 
commended all along. Fast, pray, tithe. 
</P>
<P>
To the monsignor, this indeed seemed miraculous, though he advised caution, 
too. Prophecies can be a trick of the human mind, just another sharp rock in 
the winding cave of consciousness. This was a time for discernment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the necessary judgments became obvious to him rather soon. Things 
lined up perfectly, 
</P>
<P>
like the landing lights on a runway. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, all was provided for. When Mary Constancio had to leave one 
Monday, Our Lady told her the message would simply go to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
The Virgin chose that new woman in the parish, the reedy country girl who 
already was saying God appeared to her. And lo, during the Joyful Mysteries of 
the rosary, Theresa Werner's eyes grew huge and her hands quavered. 
</P>
<P>
She began to write words that seared into her mind: "My dear children, it moves 
me deeply to see the faithful gather . . . that I may bless them . . . " 
</P>
<P>
At the same moment, the usually taciturn Mike Slate, 39, a retired Air Force 
master sergeant and respected parishioner, began to tremble. He, too, was 
hearing the same message. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, instead of one messenger on Monday nights there were three. They 
were the chosen ones of St. John Neumann's, and the things happening to them 
startled and mystified the rest. What stories! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out-of-Body Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Did you hear? Mary and Mike were over at Theresa's apartment, praying at the 
kitchen table. Suddenly, they felt as if they were leaving their bodies and 
ascending straight up. 
</P>
<P>
They passed the planets and the stars and then they entered heaven through a 
lustrous gate, where the Lord Jesus was there to welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Monday rosary sessions were moved from the chapel into the church, 
better to accommodate the hundreds and more. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Constancio and Mike Slate went on receiving messages from Our Lady, the 
words always carrying a loving, if distressed, tone: "For my heart becomes 
sorrowful when I see . . . my children falling into the grips of Satan." 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Werner, on the other hand, heard mostly from God, and he was invariably 
angry and unamiable, his voice rising from the brimstone depths of reckoning to 
threaten with strikings dead and tearings asunder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Famine Shall Befall Thee' 
</P>
<P>
"Afflictions I shall give unto thee . . . Famine shall befall thee; disease for 
which there shall be no cure! Woe unto thee." 
</P>
<P>
The Lord's messages seemed to favor the archaic phrasing of the King James 
Bible, though the verses were sometimes a scramble, like free association. 
</P>
<P>
Please make it stop, Theresa cried from time to time. She plugged her ears with 
fingers, but the voice was more inside than out. 
</P>
<P>
Earlene Steiert, Theresa's mom, came down from Nazareth, and it all made her 
hair stand on end. She searched her daughter's eyes for something malign. But 
no, the girl was not possessed. Where were these words coming from, then? 
</P>
<P>
That question was the nub of it. St. John Neumann's is not a parish of the poor 
and uneducated. There are plenty of professional types, including many from 
Texas Tech. Opinions broke into thirds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praying as Never Before 
</P>
<P>
Some were out-and-out ecstatic: The church had been blessed. By the fruits ye 
shall know. And no one could deny that people were praying as never before, 
happy and reverent and infused with God. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. James was studying the messages and cataloguing their truths. He had a 
color-code: orange for the Father, yellow for the Son, red for the Holy Spirit, 
blue for the Virgin Mary, and green for the saints and angels. 
</P>
<P>
The mounting body of prose had more substance than anything he'd read by 
hot-shot theologians, he said. And he challenged: "If you think these are made 
up, try writing one yourself at the same speed that's half as good." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some people were unsure. Deacon Clark Cochrane, head of Texas Tech's 
political science department, reminded the parish not to depend on miracles for 
their faith. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Virgin Mary was appearing in Lubbock -- and maybe not. And to many 
who were uncertain the answer was not even essential. So what if the glitter is 
false as long as the light is true. Who can deny the messages were good? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seems Loony Tunes' 
</P>
<P>
Well, actually, plenty failed to find the merit. Have you people gone nuts? 
they wanted to know. Nancy Richard, wife of a church deacon, was threatening to 
quit. "This all just seems loony tunes to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Koch, an acolyte, remarked caustically to friends, "Too much is 
coincidence. Something gets said in a sermon on Sunday and it shows up in a 
message on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics, for the most part, thought the whole thing was something Joe James 
had imported from Medjugorje. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing deceitful, mind you. But the monsignor had the lyrical tongue of a 
revivalist. If he was on fire with Our Lady, others naturally would be drawn to 
the flame for its soul-comforting warmth. 
</P>
<P>
The rosary sessions seemed to them like a seance, the voices born and reborn in 
the messengers by the powers of suggestion -- from Joe James, from their own 
upbringing, from their longing to know God. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Constancio, after all, spoke of the monsignor as if he preached from some 
elevated pulpit at the right hand of God. Mike Slate, the burly Vietnam vet, 
was already a man prone to chatting with angels. 
</P>
<P>
And that batty Theresa. Who knew what went on in her head? She acted as if she 
had her own burning bush. 
</P>
<P>
Enough was enough. Jo Wilmoth, of the parish council, took Joe James aside. 
"Father, don't you think we ought to slow down a bit?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
But he just aimed an index finger at her heart and demanded to know: "Are you 
praying three 
</P>
<P>
rosaries a day?" 
</P>
<P>
By mid-summer, 2,000 and more crowded around St. John's every Monday night. 
They came from as far as Dallas and Albuquerque and Mexico City -- and every 
new face seemed further evidence of the ripening fruits of a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Several pilgrims claimed to be cured of aches and ailments. Those reports 
fetched all the Texas newspapers. The Ft. Worth Star Telegram asked: "It 
happened in Lourdes. Why not in Lubbock?" 
</P>
<P>
To some, the publicity was a vindication of sorts, though it left the doubters 
appalled. This thing had gotten so huge everything else was nudged aside. The 
parish council had quit meeting. The newsletter had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
And for what? For all people knew, the messages might be heresy. Yet dissent 
was unwelcome. "The mood from Father James was, if you don't like what's going 
on, get up and leave," said John Zak. 
</P>
<P>
The anxiety spread. Other local priests were perturbed, too. Why isn't the Holy 
Virgin appearing at our church? their parishioners wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Curtis Halfmann, over at St. Joseph's, explained to his flock that the 
Virgin Mary was appearing in fertile imaginations, not corporeal presence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lines for Confession 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he knew the rosary messages had supposedly brought many back to God. There 
were six lines at St. John's just for confession. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the good ends did not justify the means. "Think of a woman who 
came to repentance after having an abortion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some clergymen, increasingly upset, began calling the office of the Bishop of 
Lubbock, Michael J. Sheehan. Do something! they pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop stepped carefully amid the fissures. In a statement, he said he 
could neither encourage nor discourage participation in the rosary sessions. 
</P>
<P>
He did want to warn, however. The teaching is clear. Catholics are to imitate 
the virtues of the Virgin and venerate her as they would the saints, but 
worship is reserved for God. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, while private revelations from Mary have sometimes been approved 
by the church, "the tradition is never to presume supernatural causes." That 
comes only after a lengthy investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orders From Bishop 
</P>
<P>
OK, let's get Rome moving on it, Joe James said. But the bishop had another 
idea in mind and he delivered the news behind closed doors. Start playing this 
thing real low-key, he said. Hear me? Understand? 
</P>
<P>
This only confused the monsignor. Why put on the brakes now with the Blessed 
Mother in our midst? Instead he was planning a shrine, an information center 
and much more. He wouldn't -- he couldn't -- slow down. After all: 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Werner had revealed to him this vision. Come Aug. 15, on the Feast of 
the Assumption, some 20,000 people would come to Lubbock, and Our Lady would 
appear above and the sun would throb like a heart in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Such a prospect was fever to him. There was so much to do. He went to City Hall 
to alert officials. Twenty thousand people! they gasped. Where will we hold an 
event as big as that? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the monsignor answered, the Virgin Mary has been showing up at our place 
so we might as well have it there. 
</P>
<P>
The great numbers sprawled across the lawn, past the parking lot and into the 
empty field across the street. They faced an outdoor altar set up on the flat 
roof above the church office. State troopers managed the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Space in the concrete courtyard beside the fountain was reserved for the lame 
in their walkers and wheelchairs. The sun stared down 98-degrees mean, and in 
time the crowd bloomed with umbrellas for protection. 
</P>
<P>
People had come from everywhere. Who knows how they heard? Some read of it in 
the papers and said the event summoned a memory of a dream they'd had. They 
milled about in expectation -- Catholics, fundamentalists, gypsies, name it. 
</P>
<P>
When Theresa Werner arrived in late afternoon, there was a brief cascade of 
rain. Praise the Lord. This was just as prophesied -- that the Virgin would 
come through the clouds like an inconsolable storm yet also gentle as a dove. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa had endured a difficult week. She had quarreled with Joe James about 
whether to attend a retreat -- only later to remind herself that he was her 
earthly superior and she kissed his feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked to Give Blessing 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, as the pilgrims began arriving, she felt uneasy when so many 
wanted her blessings. She had never prayed over people before, but found she 
was able, through the glory of God and his Son Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Now was the feast day itself, and she met the other messengers to pray the 
rosary. Mass started just before sunset, and only moments into the liturgy an 
ancient power seemed to burst through the modern sky. 
</P>
<P>
Clouds glided in from the south and when they reached across the descending 
sun, people spied images out of the changing light. See her! some shouted. And 
there was Mary, as promised, the handmaid of the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Lovette of Whiteface, Tex., glimpsed the Virgin in a full Nativity 
scene, just like a Christmas card. Sunbeams shot out from the cradle of straw 
as if they were rods of neon. 
</P>
<P>
We have a God, Celeste whispered to herself. Then she watched the fluid 
gleaming reshape into a new portrait, the Virgin smiling, her hands out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Saw Serpent 
</P>
<P>
Different people beheld different images, some Jesus and some an eagle and some 
a serpent with a beady little eye. And some -- even a man devout as Joe James 
-- saw nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
As people peered longer into the brightness, the sun seemed to spin and flip 
and pulsate, lurching closer, then pulling back. All was spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Those with Polaroid cameras snapped away, and the photos rode the heat of the 
crowd, hand to hand. They showed the outline of what could be an entrance 
superimposed on the sun. It is the doorway to heaven, people declared. 
</P>
<P>
Rosaries dipped in the fountain turned the bright golden of wedding bands, or 
so dozens of witnesses claimed. Rose Marie Dama, of Waco, Tex., said hers 
changed colors even as she held it in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Benoist of Albuquerque swore the water gave life to the legs of her 
infant boy, struck by cerebral palsy. Josie Todd of Lubbock escaped the pain in 
her back that had kept her from work for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moon Had Bright Hues 
</P>
<P>
When the moon rose, it too throbbed in bright hues. The glow bathed the crowd 
as people responded to the beseeches of the Mass. Let us proclaim the mystery 
of our faith. 
</P>
<P>
In the darkness, a lady in white moved through the multitude. Her head was 
hidden under a hood, and she discreetly handed out gifts of $100 bills. No one 
knew who she was, and she seemed to vanish as suddenly as she came. 
</P>
<P>
"Please take this," she told polio victim Elena Ramos, of Abernathy, Tex., 
giving her a booklet of Bible verses with the money folded inside. 
</P>
<P>
Among the throng was at least one other mysterious woman. She emerged for just 
an instant and embraced Theresa Werner. "I have a message from the Lord," she 
said. "The work is finished." 
</P>
<P>
And that was how Theresa learned her time as an instrument for God's divine 
purposes on earth was over. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she could rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sought to assure the world Saturday that 
no Chernobyl-like disaster looms in Arctic waters as observers here said the 
fiery accident that sank an advanced nuclear-powered submarine Friday claimed 
many more lives than initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
After battling fire, explosion and the icy Norwegian Sea, more than 60 Soviet 
submariners are now feared dead as a result of the catastrophe that touched off 
international concerns of radioactive dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much to indicate that the number of dead was higher than first 
thought -- though we do not have an exact figure," Norway's Defense Ministry 
spokesman Erik Senstad said. Earlier reports placed the number of deaths at 12, 
with many missing and an unknown number rescued by Soviet ships responding to 
distress signals. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev relayed statements to the President Bush and other world leaders 
offering assurances that no nuclear disaster is in store in Arctic waters -- in 
part because the crew shut off the submarine's nuclear reactors before 
abandoning the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of a nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the 
environment is excluded, according to the opinion of experts," Gorbachev said 
in one such telegram to the Norwegian government. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Norway dispatched ships and helicopters to collect water and air 
samples to be tested in Oslo for possible radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian scientists reported early today that preliminary tests indicated 
little chance of radioactive contamination of the air. 
</P>
<P>
"The test shows that a radiation leak while the sub was on the surface is 
unlikely. It does not tell us if there was a leak after it sank," said Tor 
Strand of the Institute for Radiation Protection. 
</P>
<P>
The institute said initial tests of samples from a Norwegian reconnaissance 
plane that flew over the area immediately after the sinking did not show 
abnormal amounts of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities said the possibility of widespread contamination is slight. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev confirmed and expressed regret that "human lives were lost" but 
offered no casualty figures. He said a commission will investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the naval disaster. The cause of the fire is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the efforts made after the fire broke out," Gorbachev said in one 
telegram, "it was unfortunately not possible to save the ship." 
</P>
<P>
Senstad said Soviet officials confirmed that the vessel was a Mike-class 
submarine, the only one of its type and used to test advanced weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Nuclear Reactors 
</P>
<P>
Powered by two nuclear reactors, the submarine was believed to be an 
experimental model, capable of deep submergence and quiet, fast running. It 
carried six torpedo tubes from which it was equipped to fire conventional or 
nuclear torpedoes, along with short-range anti-ship missiles and the SS-N-21, a 
nuclear-tipped cruise missile with a range of more than 1,100 miles, designed 
to hit land targets. Soviet officials refused to say whether the vessel was 
carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Until full reports have been received from naval commanders and the Defense 
Ministry, Soviet spokesmen say they can provide few details -- not the cause of 
the fire or its extent, not the number of dead, injured or missing or the 
number rescued. 
</P>
<P>
If Norway's statements prove correct, about two-thirds of the submarine's 
95-member crew were killed in the drama that began when a fire broke out about 
11:41 a.m., local time, as the vessel traveled submerged in international 
waters, about 300 miles off the northern Norwegian coast. 
</P>
<P>
The submarine surfaced with its stern ablaze and exploded before sinking in 
more than 4,500 feet of water at about 5:15 p.m., about 120 miles southwest of 
Norway's Bear Island and 310 miles west of Tromsoe, on Norway's northern coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We know now that there was a powerful explosion on board after the fire spread 
and the vessel began to list," Senstad said. 
</P>
<P>
According to some unofficial reports in the Soviet Union, the crew may have 
scuttled the vessel themselves after battling the fire for more than five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Later, some crew members were spotted by Norwegian air force observers in 
overloaded life rafts. Some men were clinging to the sides, immersed in the icy 
waters. Norwegian television showed a photograph of a raft packed with crew 
members. 
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian Defense Ministry statement said it appeared that between 40 and 50 
people escaped before the submarine went down. 
</P>
<P>
"How many of those survived injuries and exposure to the cold water is 
uncertain," the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
Picked up by Soviet fishing trawlers and other vessels, survivors on Saturday 
were reportedly aboard a Soviet warship heading for the Soviet port of 
Murmansk. 
</P>
<P>
The submarine went down where the Norwegian Sea meets the Barents Sea -- a kind 
of underwater playground for U.S. and Soviet submarines seeking one another out 
in a sort of cat-and-mouse game. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rescue ships that arrived on the scene was a Kirov-class cruiser 
with extensive medical facilities aboard. 
</P>
<P>
While providing only minimal information about the sinking of the submarine and 
the fire that led to its loss, the Soviet government has sought to reassure the 
international community that there is no radiation danger. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, returning from a visit to London, went immediately to his Kremlin 
office late Friday night to review the situation, according to informed Soviet 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
He was briefed by ranking military and naval officers and nuclear propulsion 
and nuclear safety specialists, who reportedly assured the Soviet leadership 
that both nuclear reactors aboard the submarine had been shut down as soon as 
the fire broke out and that there was no danger of a radiation leak from the 
sunken vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev then sent brief messages to Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Bush; the 
Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact allies were also notified, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said the Soviets notified 
it of the sub accident early Saturday and that the Soviets said there was no 
danger of a nuclear explosion or radioactive contamination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism Over Chernobyl 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials were criticized for not providing accurate or timely 
information after the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant that sent a cloud of radiation into the atmosphere, 
contaminating crops and livestock in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Kremlin wanted to get the word out as quickly as the facts were 
clear, according to Moscow sources, but was hampered in that Gorbachev and 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the foreign minister, had not yet returned from London. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had been alerted to the disaster while en route to Moscow, these 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst also said he thought that the 
risk of radioactive contamination was slight. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that this type of vessel has two nuclear reactors and we assume that 
these nuclear reactors, because of very modern design, will be able to 
withstand the pressure involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the uncertainties, I think, have to do with the impact of the fire that 
preceded the submarine sinking." 
</P>
<P>
Johan Baarli of the government's Institute for Radiation Protection said his 
agency dispatched two boats to the area to check for radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Naval expert Damian Durrant of the international environmental group Greenpeace 
said the accident brought the number of nuclear-powered submarines lying on the 
seabed to six -- four Soviet and two American. 
</P>
<P>
"Over half the world's nuclear power reactors are at sea, which is the most 
dangerous place for them to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said that Soviet ships and planes are hovering close around 
the place where the craft went down, effectively maintaining their claim on the 
sunken vessel. Abandoned ships are considered fair game for any nation's 
salvage operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are on-site and they are unlikely to be off-site anytime soon," 
said a Pentagon official. 
</P>
<P>
The waters in which the sub sank reach depths of more than 4,500 feet -- beyond 
range of most salvage operations, experts said, but shallow enough to be within 
reach of submersible research vessels that could survey the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is right in their (the Soviets') back yard," said one U.S. official. He 
added that it is "highly unlikely" that U.S. military forces would make an 
attempt to retrieve anything from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Tuohy reported from Oslo and Parks reported from Moscow. Times staff writer 
Melissa Healy in Washington also contributed to the story.

Soviet Disaster At Sea 
</P>
<P>
An advanced Soviet nuclear-powered Mike-class submarine, apparently en route to 
the Soviet Arctic port of Murmansk, caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea 
on Friday. A chronology of the events follows: 
</P>
<P>
A: Fire breaks out about 11:41 a.m. local time while vessel is submerged. 
Distress signal sent about 45 minutes later. Crew members try to contain blaze. 
</P>
<P>
B: Sub surfaces and fire apparently spreads from one section of the 361-foot 
vessel to several others and sets off an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
C: Life rafts carrying an undetermined number of crew members are spotted in 
the ocean; survivors picked up by Soviet warships and taken to Murmansk. 
</P>
<P>
D: After five hours of unsuccessful attempts to extinguish the fire, Soviet 
officials order the nuclear reactors turned off. Sub sinks in more than 4,500 
feet of water. Norwegian reports indicate that about two-thirds of the crew 
members, estimated to number about 95, may have died.

The managing editor of a major Turkish newsmagazine went into hiding last month 
after being sentenced to nine years in jail for articles carried by the leftist 
publication, friends said. Fatma Yazici, 33, managing editor of the weekly 
Toward 2000, was charged with producing Communist and Kurdish propaganda, 
insulting Islam and being disrespectful to the president. The magazine has 
constantly been in trouble with authorities for tackling taboo subjects that 
often lead to prosecution under the country's restrictive press law.

Three nurses in one of Vienna's oldest hospitals have been arrested on 
suspicion of killing up to 35 patients with drug overdoses, Austrian 
authorities said. The newspaper Die Presse said it was "the biggest mass 
killing in Austria's criminal history." Vienna Police Chief Guenther Boegl said 
the three female nurses, ranging in age from 26 to 30, worked in the Lainz 
Hospital on the city's western outskirts and have admitted killing a number of 
patients with lethal injections that included insulin, normally used to treat 
diabetes. "It appears they acted out of a misguided sense of mercy, but we are 
also investigating other motives," Boegl said. "Not all the patients were 
terminally ill."

Return of billions of dollars in paid Medicare claims is being sought by the 
Health and Human Services and Justice departments. A spokesman for HHS 
Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow told the Washington Post that in many 
cases the law clearly makes private insurance companies liable for payment of 
patient claims for a number of employed persons over 65; but often the 
companies failed to pay bills, leaving them to Medicare. Louis B. Hays, acting 
administrator of Medicare, told the Post that underpayments over the last six 
years by private insurance companies may total several billion dollars.

The Utah Legislature overwhelmingly approved $5 million to finance a reported 
discovery of simple, safe and inexpensive nuclear fusion that University of 
Utah scientists say could revolutionize energy production. With only two 
dissenting votes, the 75-member House in Salt Lake City approved separate bills 
establishing an oversight committee and appropriating $5 million through fiscal 
1990 for fusion research and development. The state Senate approved the 
measures with only a single opposing vote cast. Fusion was the sole topic of a 
one-day special session of the Legislature, called by Gov. Norman H. Bangerter 
to support the discovery announced March 23 by researchers at the university.

The San Francisco Police Depatment promised to stop officers from impersonating 
television cameramen while videotaping demonstrations after two broadcast 
journalists discovered an impostor in their midst. Police Chief Frank Jordan, 
who made the promise when broadcast organizations attacked the practice, 
confirmed that a police officer had posed as a cameraman for KING-TV of Seattle 
while videotaping a protest in front of the El Salvador consul general's 
office. The incident came to light after two journalists from KGO-TV noticed 
someone they believed to be an impostor filming the peaceful protest.

Bottle-throwing demonstrators clashed with police at a rally of the right-wing 
Republican Party in central West Germany. A police spokesman said 17 people, 
including two police officers, were injured and seven demonstrators were 
arrested during the fighting in Grossostheim. About 1,400 people attended the 
demonstration, which was organized by an anti-rightist group that accuses the 
Republicans of being neo-fascist. The Republican Party, campaigning to stop a 
growing influx of political asylum-seekers into West Germany, won an unexpected 
7.5% of the vote in January's elections for the West Berlin city parliament.

Breaking with its Democratic allies, the Liberal Party in New York City 
endorsed Republican former U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani for mayor, calling 
him a "fresh" alternative to Mayor Edward I. Koch. The endorsement virtually 
assured Giuliani a place on the ballot in November even if he loses the 
Republican primary. It also improved his chances of becoming mayor in a city 
where Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1. The former prosecutor gained 
national attention by prosecuting major organized-crime figures, Wall Street 
inside traders and corrupt public officials. He resigned in January. Giuliani 
is expected to announce his candidacy officially next month.

The Rancho Seco nuclear power plant began producing electricity 11 days after a 
shutdown that prompted federal officials to summon the utility district's board 
members to Washington. The troubled plant 25 miles southeast of Sacramento was 
brought to 35% power and will be kept at that level for several days for tests. 
It will then be brought to 60% for more tests and finally to its normal 
operating level of 92%. Meantime, the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District 
invited the public to tour the plant over the weekend as part of a "spring open 
house" designed to improve the plant's public relations in advance of a June 
election to determine its fate. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission summoned 
district board members and staff to Washington to talk about the shutdown and a 
nuclear industry organization's critique of the plant and the district.

Pakistan warned Afghanistan's Marxist government that it risks "serious 
consequences" after a Soviet-made Scud B missile landed about 500 yards inside 
Pakistani territory. The Afghan government called it an accident, saying the 
missile missed its guerrilla target and went across the border near the village 
of Torkham. Kabul refused to apologize, again accusing Pakistan of aiding the 
U.S.-backed Muslim guerrillas fighting the Afghan government. There were 
conflicting reports on whether the missile caused any casualties. Pakistan's 
Foreign Ministry said the incident was a ploy to persuade the U.N. Security 
Council to debate the Afghan crisis.

Three white anti-apartheid parties merged in South Africa in hopes of boosting 
their collectively sagging fortunes with national elections looming. The 
formation of the new Democratic Party is an attempt to broaden the political 
base of white liberals, who have suffered repeated setbacks in recent years. 
The new party -- "which rejects race as its basis," according to a leading 
member -- is to have three leaders, those who served as heads of the merging 
parties. They are Zac de Beer of the Progressive Federal Party, Wynand Malan of 
the National Democratic Movement and Denis Worrall of the Independent Party. 
The first major test for the Democratic Party will come in this year's 
parliamentary elections, expected between late July and early September.

IMPORTED PRODUCE -- PESTICIDES ARE THE MAJOR CULPRIT

<P>
The border inspector made his way quickly through the stacked boxes, picking up 
a bunch of bananas, a carton of strawberries, a cucumber, a green bell pepper. 
Awaiting his attentions were crates of plantains, radishes, turnips, cilantro, 
asparagus, mustard greens and lettuce, all unloaded onto the cargo bays from 
waiting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful," the inspector said, working his way rapidly through the crates, on 
the lookout for signs of pests, disease or other abnormalities. "Muy bonito." 
</P>
<P>
So it goes each day at the Otay Mesa Cargo Processing Facility, the entry point 
for Mexican goods arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The bustling activity along the border is a part of the huge traffic of Mexican 
produce that moves north every day. 
</P>
<P>
While the sabotage of grapes recently focused attention on imports of Chilean 
products, it is Mexican fruit and vegetables that represent a much greater, and 
growing, chunk of the U.S. food consumption market. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mexico is by far the largest foreign supplier of fresh produce to the 
United States, sending north more than $600 million worth, mostly vegetables, 
last fiscal year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Chile, which 
ranked a distant second, exported somewhat less than $300 million worth of 
produce, mostly fruit, to the United States during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constant Concern 
</P>
<P>
While sabotage, such as occurred with Chilean grapes, is a constant concern, 
activists worry about a more common problem: pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, as in the United States and other agricultural nations, pesticides 
are used extensively to destroy or control weeds, insects, fungi and other 
pests. Their application is credited with great gains in farm production. But 
many pesticides remain on fruits and vegetables and are ultimately ingested 
along with the food. Some have been shown to cause cancer or birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
With pesticide applications subject to less monitoring in Mexico and many other 
nations than in the United States, congressional investigators and others have 
raised questions about inspection of Mexican and other foreign produce as it 
arrives at U.S. ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a completely inadequate monitoring system at the border," said Jay 
Feldman, national coordinator for the National Coalition Against the Misuse of 
Pesticides, a Washington-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators insist that the pesticide residues in both imported and 
domestically produced foods are small. "We've monitored this for years, and 
we've found that the intake of pesticide residue is well below the acceptable 
daily intake," said Emil Corwin, a spokesman in Washington for the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Of all imported foodstuffs sampled in 1987, the FDA says that 5.3% violated 
U.S. pesticide standards. However, that percentage is more than double the 2.6% 
of domestic food samples that were found to be in violation, according to FDA 
figures. (Ironically, Feldman notes that some pesticides banned in the United 
States but produced by U.S. manufacturers for foreign sales wind up back in the 
U.S. food chain through the food-import market.) 
</P>
<P>
With truckload after truckload of produce arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border 
daily -- about 1.5 million metric tons annually, more than 3 billion pounds -- 
finding pesticides on a given head of lettuce can be a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1986 Study 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 congressional study found that the FDA samples less than 1% of imported 
food shipments; that the agency was capable of detecting less than half of the 
estimated 600 pesticides available on the world market, and that many 
pesticide-tainted foods were ultimately sold to U.S. consumers because of 
delays in pulling the produce off the market. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials say they have worked hard to rectify some of the shortcomings 
identified by the inquiry, bolstering staff and improving inspection and lab 
techniques, among other things. "You can't absolutely guarantee safety in any 
case, said Gordon Scott, consumer affairs officer in the FDA's Los Angeles 
regional office, which covers Southern California and Arizona. "You try to do a 
statistical round of sampling." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, the growing produce trade is a much-needed source of 
foreign revenue for debt-wracked Mexico -- one that has been encouraged by 
Mexico City, with considerable success. The trend is upward. 
</P>
<P>
Vast irrigated production areas, such as the San Quintin region south of 
Ensenada in Baja California, have been carved out of parched desert and 
semi-desert largely to serve the U.S. market. Other key producing regions for 
the U.S. trade include the northern states of Sonora, Tamaulipas and Sinaloa. 
Modern highways lead directly from the farms and packing sheds to the border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Investors 
</P>
<P>
Spurring the industry is the investment of many U.S.-based growers and 
international agribusiness concerns, drawn to Mexico by its proximity to the 
U.S. market, its cheap land, abundant sunshine, inexpensive labor and relative 
lack of regulations. Harsh working conditions and low pay for field hands, many 
of them Indians from the Mexican interior, have led to sporadic work stoppages 
and labor confrontations, but Mexican labor activists say their reform efforts 
have been stymied by the government's alliance with big growers. 
</P>
<P>
Most Mexican foodstuffs arrive via refrigerated trailer trucks at a dozen or so 
entry points along the 1,952-mile border, from Brownsville, Tex., on the Gulf 
Coast to San Diego on the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the Mexican produce consists of winter vegetables destined for the 
supermarkets and grocery stores of the West. Tomatoes are king among the 
Mexican produce, accounting for more than 25% of total fruit and vegetable 
imports, followed by cucumbers, onions and peppers; more than 50 varieties of 
fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs arrive from Mexico. Shipments of Mexican 
strawberries passing through Otay Mesa have grown from zero in 1983 to 26 
million pounds last year. 
</P>
<P>
Because of pests that could be harmful to U.S. fruit crops, notably the Mexican 
and Mediterranean fruit flies, many Mexican fruits, such as citrus products, 
generally cannot be legally exported across the border unless accompanied by 
special certificates from U.S.-employed inspectors in Mexico attesting that the 
produce is pest free. Authorities concede that only a small percentage of 
produce and other goods can actually be looked at; they rely on sample spot 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
At the border, agricultural inspectors look for disease-bearing crops as FDA 
officials seek excessive pesticide residues. U.S. Customs Service personnel, 
sometimes employing drug-sniffing dogs amid the produce crates, attempt to 
ensure that duties are paid and no contraband is hidden amid the shipments.

UEBERROTH MAY REPLACE TOP EASTERN MANAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth said Saturday that members of 
his group of investors, including current officials at other airlines, may 
replace some of Eastern Airlines' top management if the planned $464-million 
purchase of the troubled carrier goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, speaking to reporters in Beverly Hills, said specific plans for 
management changes had not been drawn up yet. But Phil Bakes, Eastern's current 
president and chief executive, may be among those replaced if a new management 
team is brought in. Ueberroth said "I don't know" when asked if Bakes is likely 
to remain at the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth declined to identify any of the members of his investment group who 
would be brought in to Eastern's management. But he said it was "just a small 
group" of individuals, including several who now work for other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chapter 11 Protection 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's unions favor replacement of current management of the airline, which 
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
code five days after workers went out on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be airline chairman was in town briefly Saturday to appear before 
institutional investors at Drexel Burnham Lambert's annual junk bond conference 
at the Beverly Hilton. Drexel has committed itself to providing $300 million in 
financing for the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth told reporters that he may continue to receive advice on the 
transaction from Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond 
department. Milken on Friday pleaded not guilty to racketeering and securities 
fraud charges, and has taken a leave of absence from Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggestions From Milken 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Ueberroth had disclosed that he received suggestions from 
Milken in a telephone conversation on how to structure the deal. Ueberroth 
described Milken as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth on Saturday said: "He may call me. I may call him." But he said any 
contacts would be limited to receiving advice from Milken. He said Milken would 
not participate in any transactions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations With 3 Unions 
</P>
<P>
Speculation on management changes at Eastern may be moot if Ueberroth's group 
fails to come to terms with Eastern's unions. The investors reportedly are 
seeking $210 million a year in wage and work rule concessions from the three 
unions representing Eastern's machinists, pilots and flight attendants. In 
exchange, both union and non-union employees would get a 30% ownership share in 
the company. The Ueberroth group would own 30%, while other investors would get 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the unions were continuing through the weekend, with a 
deadline of midnight Tuesday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has been 
pressing for a quick resolution. Ueberroth said Saturday that he expects the 
deal to collapse if an agreement is not reached by then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fails to Appear 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Bakes might be replaced has grown since Thursday, when he 
failed to appear at the press conference in which the agreement to sell Eastern 
was announced. Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent 
firm, was present. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Bakes had played a prominent role March 9 in publicly announcing 
Eastern's decision to file bankruptcy proceedings. An Eastern spokesman said 
Saturday that Bakes would not have any comment on Ueberroth's statement.

AGENDA, TIMETABLE SET FOR TALKS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
</P>

<P>
Negotiators from 96 countries, including the United States, reached formal 
agreement Saturday in Geneva on a detailed agenda and timetable for the most 
sweeping set of global trade liberalization talks in history -- with plans to 
begin the talks as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, which sets the terms for 21 months of hard bargaining over key 
trade issues, paves the way for extending international trade rules to 15 new 
subject areas, from agriculture and services to investment and intellectual 
property, such as patents. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus on the negotiating mandate -- worked out under the aegis of the 
Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-country compact 
that sets and enforces global trading rules -- came after agreement was reached 
late Friday on parameters for talks on agricultural trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Into Morning 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators worked into Saturday morning to complete negotiating agendas 
covering talks in two other areas -- trade in textiles and limits on temporary 
protection to industries that are seriously injured by an unexpected surge of 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the negotiating outline clears the way for trade officials to 
begin serious bargaining on the substantive issues in the talks. The 
negotiations, known formally as the Uruguay Round, are scheduled to come to a 
close in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said Saturday in Washington that 
the negotiators will "go to work immediately" in Geneva this week to launch the 
discussions on key issues. Hills is expected to make several appearances before 
Congress this week to explain the process. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's agreement broke an impasse that has plagued the GATT talks for 
months. The negotiators were supposed to have finished the agenda at a 
ministerial meeting in Montreal in December, but they broke up in disarray then 
because of a stalemate over the farm trade issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Extend Rules 
</P>
<P>
The United States proposed the broad-scale trade talks in 1982 as a way of 
invigorating the world trading system and extending current global rules on 
trade practices to cover areas such as agriculture and services, which have not 
previously been included. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan on which participants agreed in 1986, when the Uruguay Round was 
launched, the first two years of talks were designed to hammer out the terms of 
the negotiations that would take place in 1989 and 1990. That is the phase the 
negotiators have completed now. 
</P>
<P>
Hills cautioned Saturday that eliminating more trade barriers, as the 
negotiators have pledged to do, would not in itself reduce the United States' 
huge trade deficit, but she said it would help bring about a "correction" by 
providing "a context of trade expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Hills reiterated that the negotiating countries have put all of their trade 
barriers "on the table" for the new trade talks. The United States "is 
dedicated to reducing . . . distortions across-the-board if our trading 
partners do the same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motive to Succeed 
</P>
<P>
She also dismissed suggestions that the trade talks might fail. "There is 
enough at stake to cause all parties in the world to want to succeed," she said 
at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Besides writing new rules for areas such as trade in services, the negotiators 
also hope to hammer out a new dispute-settlement procedure in the GATT to help 
resolve trade frictions between two or more members. Washington has complained 
recently that current rules are too weak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidies, Tariffs Included 
</P>
<P>
Along with trade in agriculture, services, investment and intellectual 
property, the talks also are expected to deal with excessive government 
subsidies, further reductions in tariffs, and trade in tropical products, which 
are grown mainly by developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
The language on talks over trade in agriculture calls for negotiating "a 
substantial, progressive reduction" in government farm subsidies over several 
years, and for an immediate freeze -- and some rollbacks, where possible -- of 
current farm trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the wording fell somewhat short of the total elimination of 
agricultural trade barriers that the United States had wanted to make U.S. farm 
products more competitive overseas, Hills said Washington was pleased with the 
outcome because it pointed the talks in the direction that the Administration 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that we have to stop short" of the U.S. goal in the talks, she 
said. "If you have a 'substantial, progressive reduction' of agricultural 
subsidies and trade barriers, as the agreement says, there's no way you can't 
get down to zero," she asserted.

About 200 police using helicopters and dogs searched Saturday for six inmates 
who fled a jail by sawing through the bars on a window and shimmying over a 
razor-sharp fence. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates escaped in a group of 13 Friday night from the Norfolk County House 
of Correction. Two were quickly captured, and five others were caught Saturday.

Overcrowding and racial tensions have fueled several outbreaks at the prison

Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least six Arabs on Saturday on the first 
day of a two-day general strike beginning the 17th month of the uprising 
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old boy shot in the West Bank town of Janin was in serious condition 
at an Israeli hospital, an army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Shops were closed in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab East Jerusalem, and 
most workers stayed home in observance of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
In Janin in the West Bank, Palestinian teen-agers threw stones when troops 
entered the town. The soldiers forced residents to paint over nationalistic 
graffiti and take down outlawed Palestinian flags. 
</P>
<P>
During the confrontations between the troops and stone-throwers, the 
12-year-old, Maher Shalbak, was shot twice in the neck, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was in Haifa's Rambam Hospital in serious condition, the army spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, at least five Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, 
Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Curfews were clamped on seven Gaza refugee camps, two villages and parts of 
Gaza City, residents said.

WOMAN, BRANDISHING TOY PISTOL IN HOLLYWOOD, FATALLY SHOT BY OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified woman who threatened several people in Hollywood with a toy 
pistol Saturday was fatally wounded when she was shot four times by a Los 
Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman died at 5:40 p.m. after surgery at St. Joseph Medical Center in 
Burbank. She was shot by police officer George Caulford an hour earlier on 
Cahuenga Avenue between Hollywood Boulevard and Selma Avenue, police spokesman 
Lt. William Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred a few minutes after Caulford was flagged down by a 
business person who reported that the woman had pointed a gun at a customer 
inside his store and then hurried away on foot southbound on Cahuenga, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later Caulford observed a woman talking to two men sitting in a car who 
had "fear in their eyes," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver dove out the window, and as soon as he did, she pulled a gun from 
her handbag and pointed at him," Hall said. "The officer yelled something . . . 
but she didn't respond. . . . He fired four times from his pistol." 
</P>
<P>
"When it was all said and done," Hall added, "she had a very realistic looking 
replica of a 9mm (handgun)."

CHINESE DISSIDENT ARRIVES IN U.S.; BEIJING STAND ON HIS RETURN UNCLEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
A Chinese dissident who had organized a petition calling for an amnesty of 
political prisoners has arrived in the United States after Chinese government 
officials put him on a plane out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of up in the air what my status is now. Now it depends on how I 
behave overseas, I guess," said Chen Jun, 31, who was greeted at San Francisco 
International Airport on Friday by about three dozen supporters and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived with $100 in his pocket. His ticket to the United States was 
bought by the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to characterize himself as having been expelled, saying only that 
"I was left no choice about whether to leave or stay." Whether he can return to 
China remains unresolved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials in Hong Kong had refused to let Chen enter the colony, 
according to the dissident's British wife, Jennifer Holdaway. Chen then boarded 
a Singapore Airlines jet for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Chen has a U.S. green card that gives him residency rights. He lived in the 
United States from 1984 to 1987, and was married during part of that time to an 
American woman. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is part owner of a Beijing bar, helped organize a petition calling 
for amnesty for political prisoners, sent to Communist authorities in February 
by leading intellectuals. Authorities rejected the plea, saying China has no 
political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Chen also briefly helped publish a pro-democracy magazine in Shanghai in 1978. 
While in the United States, he contributed articles to the New York-based 
magazine China Spring, which promotes democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government considers it reactionary and has jailed several other 
people connected with it. 
</P>
<P>
An official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office said Chen left the country 
voluntarily. However, Holdaway said it "amounted to" expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Holdaway said Chen and his father, He Weidu, were taken into police custody 
Wednesday when they arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. The father, a retired 
teacher, was released that night. 
</P>
<P>
Chen was kept in custody until he was put on the plane, and other family 
members in Shanghai were denied permission to see him, Holdaway said. He was 
allowed to call her just before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
She said Chen had hoped to leave for the United States in a few weeks for a 
prolonged stay and went to Shanghai to ask officials to return his passport, 
which was confiscated last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to leave the country, but he didn't intend to leave so suddenly or 
spend his last 36 hours here in police custody," she said.

SLAIN GIRL'S FAMILY OFFERS GIFT FUND TO TROUBLED YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of Sara Nan Hodges, a 7-year-old Newhall girl who was allegedly 
strangled by a teen-age neighbor, plans to donate to a program for children 
with behavioral problems the $30,000 received from sympathizers, rejecting 
friends' proposals that the money be used for family members. 
</P>
<P>
Family friends who set up a trust fund initially to cover the slain girl's 
funeral expenses said that when far more money came in than was needed, they 
tried to persuade the girl's family to use it to get their own home. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's mother, Linda Hodges, and sister, Tisha Gates, 16, have been living 
with a friend and her three children in a small house for about eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Hodges refused to use the money for her own welfare, said Barbara 
Giardiana, the fund's trustee. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda from Day 1 refused to take any of these dollars. She kept saying that 
she wanted the funds to go to help kids somewhere," Giardiana said. "She said, 
'How can I take dollars from the death of my daughter?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Children's Center 
</P>
<P>
The fund, which is increasing daily, will be given to the Santa Clarita Special 
Children's Center of Newhall, Giardiana said. The center treats children with 
physical or emotional disorders, many of whom have been abused or sexually 
molested. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hodges said she is comforted by the thought that Sara's death will enable 
her to donate a significant sum of money to what she considers a very worthy 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had an extra $200 to send to anyone," she said, adding that she has 
been overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers, some of whom have donated up 
to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"It has restored my faith in humanity," she said. "I keep thinking -- look how 
many more good people there are than bad." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Cooper, 14, is accused of strangling Sara Nan Hodges and stuffing her 
body behind a water bed, where it was discovered by his landlady. Cooper has 
pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to help a whole gamut of troubled kids because of the connection with 
this case," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
The center offers a preschool for children who had problems in regular schools, 
physical therapy for disabled infants, day-care programs, and counseling to 
help children and teen-agers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Services Offered 
</P>
<P>
All center services are offered to families regardless of their ability to pay. 
Los Angeles County cuts in funds for child-abuse treatment programs last year 
took $56,000 out of the agency's $600,000 budget. Rather than cut any programs, 
the center operated at a deficit, said Executive Director Liz Seipel. 
</P>
<P>
The Hodges' donation will be used to start an endowment, which Seipel hopes 
eventually will provide a reliable source of income for the center. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we can help these children before they become crazy," Hodges said. "We 
can turn the bad into the good." 
</P>
<P>
Seipel said the center's philosophy is preventive, and is aimed at detecting 
and treating emotional problems in young children. "We try to keep small 
problems from growing with the child and getting to be big problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a preschooler who is having tantrums or isn't liked or can't keep 
friends or is basically not nice to be around, that's not going to go away," 
Seipel said. "The problem is going to grow and, as the child becomes bigger, 
the problem is going to become bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges called the growth of the trust fund a miracle. Though she is not 
religious, she said she believes that "Sara must have had a hand in it." 
</P>
<P>
"She will be remembered by so many more people that she will be able to help," 
Hodges said.

SCHOOLS WILL GEAR AIDS LESSONS TO KINDERGARTEN

In addition to finger-painting and learning to write their names, children as 
young as 5 years old will be taught about AIDS in five Ventura County school 
districts this fall as part of a controversial effort to prevent the spread of 
the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters will join a small number of students in California elementary 
schools who receive lessons about AIDS, which begin in the lower grades with 
reassurances that children do not generally contract the disease and progress 
to explanations of how it is transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ventura County educators have strived to design age-appropriate lessons, 
the programs remain controversial. For example, the Santa Paula Elementary 
Board of Education in June rejected a program that teachers had spent months 
developing after 600 parents objected to its explicitness. The board has since 
established a parents committee that will help draw up a new curriculum by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Touchy Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"Parents are going to come out of the woodwork when these programs begin," said 
Dale Forgey, superintendent of the Somis Union School District. He has decided 
against instituting the program in the early elementary grades. "It's a very 
touchy thing." 
</P>
<P>
The subject is so sensitive that San Diego Unified officials said they will 
wait until fall, 1990, to introduce AIDS awareness programs to third-graders. 
The district now mentions the disease beginning in sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my way, we'd start in kindergarten," said Edward Fletcher, district 
director of health services in San Diego. "But I recognize parents would 
probably object, so we'll take it slow and avoid creating opposition." 
</P>
<P>
A state Department of Education survey found that only about 1% of kindergarten 
students statewide received instruction about AIDS during the 1987-88 school 
year. In kindergarten through sixth grade, less than 10% of students learned 
about AIDS, while more than half of students in grades seven to 12 received 
AIDS instruction, the same survey reported. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Bradley, an AIDS education consultant for the Department of Education, 
refused to list school districts with AIDS programs for kindergartners and 
other young students. The state promised the districts answering the survey 
anonymity because administrators have found that publicity brings a flood of 
negative mail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot Program 
</P>
<P>
Most children enrolled in public schools in the San Fernando Valley are not 
taught about AIDS until seventh grade, although a pilot program began recently 
for fifth- and sixth-graders in 60 of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
413 elementary schools, said Ruth Rich, a district health education specialist. 
Two of the Valley schools involved are Pomelo Drive School in West Hills and 
Cohasset Street School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig recommended in May that 
age-appropriate information about acquired immune deficiency syndrome be taught 
to all schoolchildren as a means of preventing the spread of the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
The five Ventura County school districts that plan to offer AIDS instruction 
for elementary school children in the fall -- Moorpark and Ventura Unified, and 
Oxnard, Ocean View and Santa Paula Elementary -- are in various stages of 
developing such programs. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark and Oxnard are beginning to train teachers, although officials 
stressed that their programs are still sketchy and will be expanded with 
teachers' help. Programs at Ocean View, Santa Paula and Ventura are still in 
the early stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
Although they will vary from district to district, the AIDS programs will be 
incorporated into health and sex-education programs that include lessons about 
other communicable diseases, hygiene and illness prevention, Ventura County 
school district officials said. Guidelines published by various agencies, such 
as the national Centers for Disease Control and the American Red Cross, have 
been helpful, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allay Fears 
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control recommends that AIDS education for students in 
early elementary grades be designed to allay fears of the epidemic. In 
Moorpark, for instance, in the course of learning about health and nutrition, 
kindergartners will be taught that AIDS is a serious disease that young 
children rarely get, said Esther Garnica, a science teacher who spent a year 
researching the subject before writing the curriculum at the request of the 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark kindergartners will also learn that they cannot get AIDS just by being 
near or touching someone who has it, Garnica said. Oxnard kindergartners will 
be introduced to similar concepts, said Ethel Hayman, a sixth-grade teacher who 
helped develop the district's program. 
</P>
<P>
In the first through third grades, the concept that AIDS is not transmitted 
through casual contact -- such as by holding hands -- will be reiterated, 
officials said. In addition, Oxnard students will be taught to avoid rituals 
such as becoming "blood relatives" by cutting their fingers and mingling their 
blood. They will also be told to avoid picking up trash that they might find on 
the street, such as discarded intravenous needles, Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth grade, Moorpark and Oxnard students will learn that AIDS is caused by 
a virus that affects the immune system and that no cure exists. By fifth grade, 
when students are introduced to the human reproductive system, they will learn 
that AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents' permission must be obtained whenever sexual issues are discussed, 
school officials said. If parents choose to exclude their children from the 
AIDS program, the students will visit the library during the lessons, officials 
said. Before the programs begin in the fall, the districts will hold 
informational sessions for parents or send literature home. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all California school districts will be bound by a state law that 
becomes effective July 1 and requires teachers to stress sexual abstinence 
until marriage as the only sure way to avoid teen-age pregnancy, AIDS and 
venereal diseases. The law, introduced by state Sen. Newton R. Russell 
(R-Glendale), was supported by anti-abortion groups and religious 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
One problem Santa Paula parents had last summer with the AIDS program devised 
by teachers was that it did not sufficiently stress abstinence, said Michelle 
Kolbeck, a parent appointed by the board to help draw up the new curriculum. 
Kolbeck said the Centers for Disease Control guidelines adopted by Moorpark and 
Oxnard seem tame enough in theory, but will be impossible to adhere to. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids will ask questions about how you get AIDS, and teachers will elaborate," 
said Kolbeck, who has five young children. "The district showed us one film 
that mentioned condoms." It was shown to fourth-graders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think elementary schoolchildren have any business learning about adult 
alternatives like that," Kolbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula district officials declined to comment other than to say that they 
welcomed parents' interest in the upcoming program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Covered by Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and administrators in other districts acknowledge that discussing AIDS 
with youngsters may lead to classroom conversations not covered by curriculum 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Garnica, the teacher who wrote the Moorpark curriculum, said, "The rules are 
very clear in Moorpark -- persistent students will be referred to their parents 
if they want to know how AIDS is actually transmitted." 
</P>
<P>
But in Pasadena -- where the school district last fall started teaching AIDS 
education beginning in the first grade -- teachers sometimes take inquisitive 
students aside to discuss sensitive subjects rather than automatically 
referring them to their parents, said Pat Lachelt. No parents have complained, 
she said. Since there is no cure for AIDS, "the only method of prevention we 
have is by educating people early and honestly -- we have no choice," Lachelt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As of March 1, Los Angeles County had 6,495 AIDS cases, or about 78 per 100,000 
people, according to the state Department of Health Services. In contrast, 
Ventura County had 81 AIDS cases, or about 13 cases per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively low number of cases puts Ventura County teachers "in an 
excellent position to educate our young people and tell them how to avoid 
becoming AIDS statistics" beginning in elementary school, said Martina Rippy, a 
nurse with Ventura County's Local AIDS Assistance Program, which helps provide 
schools with information about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we wait until the incidence of AIDS in Ventura County increases and 
then wring our hands?"

POINT / COUNTERPOINT: CLOSING THE LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
AGAINST; 
</P>

MIKE MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lopez Canyon Landfill, in a once-remote area of the northeast San Fernando 
Valley, has been criticized recently for odors, noise and its ever-expanding 
mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents sought to shut the dump three times in recent months by blocking its 
entrance. The city maintains that the landfill is safe and is essential for 
waste disposal. On March 8, an unexpected gas release hospitalized four 
workers. That incited a short-lived state order that the landfill be shut. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Miller, 47, has been with the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation for 24 
years and is now its assistant director. He holds a bachelor of science degree 
in civil engineering and a master's degree in environmental engineering from 
Loyola University. He lives with his wife, Dennie, and three children, Erin, 
Dan and Ryan, in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How important is the Lopez Canyon Landfill in managing Los Angeles' solid 
waste? 
</P>
<P>
A. Lopez Canyon is our last operating landfill. That means that Lopez Canyon 
receives just about half of the 6,000 tons of household refuse that we pick up 
daily. The remainder is going to private disposal sites and to the county's 
landfill. Another 1,000 tons a day goes into Lopez Canyon from street 
sweepings, recreation and parks, airports, the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
If the landfill were shut down, there is a strong potential that we would not 
be picking up all the waste the citizens of Los Angeles put at their curb 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The bureau wants to double the landfill's size. The California Waste 
Management Board has concerns about its operation. There are numerous 
investigations. What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
A. Right now, Lopez Canyon is under the spotlight by both the community and the 
regulatory agencies. The community's concerned, and I think rightly so. They 
don't want to see Lopez Canyon lasting into the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But our responsibility is to provide to the City Council a choice. We would be 
derelict in our duties if we did not try to obtain the most disposal capacity 
that we could. 
</P>
<P>
We have a draft environmental impact report out which addresses the maximum 
utilization of what we call Canyon C. The community is obviously not in favor 
of having that developed to its maximum capacity. The decision will rest with 
the council. And we anticipate that coming about in July or August. 
</P>
<P>
The state solid waste management board identified nine items they felt were in 
violation of our permit. One was that we did not have a sign. We had some more 
serious violations, but all of those have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill at Lopez Canyon is probably being run better than it's ever been 
run before. We've expanded the staff up there since 1985 from a meager 20 to 25 
people to over 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why wasn't a gas recovery system installed earlier? 
</P>
<P>
A. The requirement for a gas control system did not come into place until about 
three years ago. We've been through a long saga of events to get something 
installed up there. We have gone out to bid now on a $1-million facility for 
the gas flare station that will be installed in July. 
</P>
<P>
One of the concerns the community has is odors. I certainly would not deny that 
the landfill has odors. We're trying to control it as best we can until we can 
get a gas control system installed. 
</P>
<P>
We've faced a problem of finding out about an odor complaint three or four days 
after it's made. To eliminate that, we have two inspectors on-site full time 
just to be monitoring the potential landfill gas problems. We also now have a 
hot line between the South Coast Air Quality Management District and our 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Q. AQMD data shows methane measurements exceeding 10,000 parts per million near 
the dump. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't want to challenge that statement because I don't know exactly where 
that sample was taken. AQMD takes tests with probes in the ground. We are 
restricted by the AQMD as to the methane level. If we find an area exceeding 
500 p.p.m., we have 24 hours to remedy that situation. 
</P>
<P>
If you put a probe in the ground, it's very possible you will measure 10,000 or 
50,000 p.p.m. At the surface level, it should not be that high. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about other gases? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're concerned about other gases too. And we periodically take samples, and 
they are analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbons and benzenes and all of the 
things that could potentially be in landfill gas. And those are all within 
acceptable levels. When we had this last incident, when two employees were 
injured, a whole battery of tests were run. And the results indicated there was 
nothing atypical of landfill gas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can the March 8 incident, which was reported to have been a release of 
hydrogen sulfide gas, happen again? 
</P>
<P>
A. Hydrogen sulfide is not commonly found in landfills. We do not expect it to 
be released that way again. 
</P>
<P>
We have been conducting an extensive training program up there because we have 
to excavate some refuse to install the gas control system. In the event we do 
hit a pocket of hydrogen sulfide gas or whatever gas there may be, a whole 
series of safety precautions has been developed, including using self-contained 
breathing apparatus for those installing the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you ease the concern of folks in that neighborhood over the health 
risks? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is the county health department's responsibility to ensure that the 
health and safety of the public is maintained. They inspect us and monitor us. 
The AQMD also monitors our activity and monitors air within the community. 
</P>
<P>
They have not found anything that is any threat to anybody. There is no health 
risk. I can understand the people's concern. I've heard statements by people in 
the community that would scare the devil out of me if I knew nothing about what 
was going on. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's irresponsible to make statements like that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Assemblywoman Marian La Follette, the 38th District Republican, has said 
that, essentially, Los Angeles has no solid waste plan. How do you respond to 
that? 
</P>
<P>
A. She's absolutely right. Back in the early '70s, we had adequate landfill 
capacity, and there wasn't much concern about the disposal of waste. But we 
realized we were potentially going to run out of capacity by the late 1970s or 
early 1980s, so we began looking for additional sites. We brought a couple of 
potential sites to the City Council for approval, and both times they were 
turned down. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed us to start investigating waste-to-energy systems. We 
pursued that for almost seven years until we had the mayor terminate that 
project in June of 1986 because of environmental concerns raised by the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
That basically turned solid waste management upside-down in this city. The only 
way we are going to be able to get rid of our waste is through an integrated 
solid waste management picture that includes recycling, waste reduction and 
landfills. We have to follow all of those with equal vigor. 
</P>
<P>
On recycling, the city will be receiving a recommended recycling plan in the 
next couple weeks. We have teamed up with the county to possibly purchase the 
Towsley Canyon landfill out on Highway 5, and we're also pursuing Elsmere 
Canyon, both of which are near Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
We also have a draft report looking at the potential of rail haul to take waste 
to the eastern California desert. 
</P>
<P>
All of these sound good, but there's a lot of problems associated with each 
one. They're all going to be in somebody's back yard. The issue of community 
reaction is always going to be there. We have to be able to overcome this.

<P>
Lopez Canyon Landfill, in a once-remote area of the northeast San Fernando 
Valley, has been criticized recently for odors, noise and its ever-expanding 
mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents sought to shut the dump three times in recent months by blocking its 
entrance. The city maintains that the landfill is safe and is essential for 
waste disposal. On March 8, an unexpected gas release hospitalized four 
workers. That incited a short-lived state order that the landfill be shut. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Zapple, 36, is a carpenter and actor who has lived in Kagel Canyon, which 
abuts the so-called B face of the landfill, since 1982. He lives there with his 
wife, Michele, their daughter, Zoe, 18 months, and their son, Holden, 5. 
Although he says he is a reluctant activist, he has been one of the most 
outspoken critics of the landfill's operation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation has operated the Lopez Canyon Landfill 
since 1975. Why are residents upset about it now? 
</P>
<P>
A. The original permit called for 8,000 tons of trash per week. All of a 
sudden, in the past 24 months, this literal monster has just started to climb 
out of this canyon next to us. It's to the point now where it blocks our sun in 
the late afternoon. They tell us now that they are dumping at a rate of 5,700 
tons per day. 
</P>
<P>
There are 9 million tons of trash up there right now, and they want to almost 
double that. It was kind of like damn the torpedoes, let's keep dumping the 
trash. I simply wanted to be left alone to live a nice, peaceful life. But it 
became apparent that there was nobody looking out for what was going on over 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happens to the 7,000 tons of trash that Los Angeles generates each day 
if the dump is closed? 
</P>
<P>
A. What should happen with the trash is like a whole other issue. It's often a 
smoke screen that is thrown up to obfuscate the problems here. It's a huge 
debate. The issue for me is this specific landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But this specific landfill is part of the larger issue of solid waste 
management. What happens to the trash? 
</P>
<P>
A. The Bureau of Sanitation has a budget of $100 million a year. They've known 
about this problem for 15 or 20 years. Here we are in 1989, the fifth- or 
sixth-largest city in the world, and they're telling us that the linchpin of 
their entire waste management plan is a faulty landfill? One that is so 
mismanaged that it doesn't even have a gas recovery system? It doesn't even 
have the basic technology installed? 
</P>
<P>
Something's wrong with this picture! We should be leading the world in this 
field, as we do in so many areas. Instead, we're worse than a Third World 
country in dealing with this problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Sanitation tries to create panic in the public by saying that if 
we close Lopez, we'll have rotting trash in the streets. That is simply not 
true. There are four other landfills in the area that could handle Lopez's 
load. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are your complaints about the landfill? 
</P>
<P>
A. The operating hours of the dump are supposed to be 7 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. 
People start hearing the trucks here at 6 a.m., and on the other side of the 
dump, it's earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Any day there is a moderate breeze, there's dust. A violation of the state 
regulations. Vector and bird control. The swarms of birds that feed off the 
trash are uncontrolled. There are no subterranean drains to control the 
leaching of poisons into the San Fernando aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
Odor. The odors coming off the landfill have been increasingly intense. In 
Kagel Canyon, Lake View Terrace, even down as far as Pacoima, you can smell the 
dump. Methane is an odorless gas. What we are really smelling is organics. But 
every time you smell that, methane is included. 
</P>
<P>
Litter control. There is trash of all kinds throughout the entire community. 
Traffic. The state inspectors have found puddles of oil and fuel where they 
drain their crankcases. A review of their operating permit is required every 
five years. It hasn't been done since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
They've trespassed and filled seven acres of U.S. Forest Service land on the 
north side. They've also tried to take over 10 acres of private land to the 
south. They don't even know where their boundaries are. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the basis for your complaints about excess methane? 
</P>
<P>
A. In June of 1986, they had an inspector come by from the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District with a meter that measures methane and goes from 
zero to 10,000 parts per million. A violation occurs when the meter registers 
over 500 p.p.m. His meter peaked out at 10,000 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD issued a violation at that time and said methane was a serious 
problem. But the Bureau of Sanitation has done nothing. For three years, they 
have been operating with an increasing amount of methane coming out of that 
landfill. They are still in the bidding process for a gas recovery system that 
has been promised to be installed in July. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The AQMD and the Bureau of Sanitation have instituted more extensive 
air-quality testing following a March 8 incident in which several workers were 
overcome by a release of an unknown gas. Are you satisfied with those measures? 
</P>
<P>
A. Methane is the only thing they are testing for. What about the other gases 
that come off the landfill? What about hydrogen sulfide? Vinyl chloride? What 
about xylenes? They've said those gases are coming off, but they tell us 
they've never tested for specific amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of our complaint is the health hazard associated with this landfill 
and its mismanagement. Ten years down the line, it's going to be too darn late 
for me and for my 18-month-old daughter. What if she starts popping up with 
liver problems or a buildup of this stuff from breathing it 24 hours a day? The 
dump is the largest air polluter in the San Fernando Valley. It is out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't we end this silly debate? Close the landfill. Install your gas 
recovery system. Fire the thing up. If it works, great. We won't be extremely 
happy. But we will be relieved to know that we are no longer being inundated 
with methane and other gases. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who is responsible for the failings you cite? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you addressed this as you would in private industry, the first thing you 
would do is cut your losses. You review your policies. If you have people who 
cannot shift their viewpoint of that policy, you replace those people. Charles 
Coffee, head of the county Department of Health Services, which is the local 
enforcement agency, and Del Biagi, the head of the Bureau of Sanitation, have 
got to be held responsible for their policies of mismanagement. Then you 
replace them with people who have a little bit of vision, who understand the 
problem and can get the thing under control.

MEMORIES OF A GREAT, GREAT MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Cal State Northridge graduate, I have been breathlessly following the 
recent dispute regarding the selection of the Hollywood Bowl as the site for 
the 1989 graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
As the sordid story has unfolded, I must admit that my heart goes out to those 
poor students who, to participate in the solemn commencement rites of my 
beloved CSUN, must face the trauma of abandoning their safe suburban campus and 
venturing to the urban jungle that is today's Hollywood. And worst yet, these 
poor students must embark on this fateful trek knowing in their hearts that the 
Hollywood Bowl facilities lack the flexibility to provide for the traditional 
handshake with CSUN President James Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
Oh woe, woe and double woe. The very thought of this gross injustice brings to 
mind happy memories from my own graduation day at Northridge. It was a 
beautiful, bright, sunny May day, the kind you read about in romance novels. I 
was excited and nervous about the ceremony, especially anxious about how I 
would perform when the big moment came. 
</P>
<P>
Would my grip be too loose? Would it be too firm, thereby hurting the great 
man's hand? Would my hands get too warm and sweaty in anticipation? Or, 
conversely, cold and clammy? Butterflies fluttered in my stomach at the thought 
of failure, yet my spine tingled in anticipation of success, for what man can 
deny the thrill of shaking James Cleary's hand and shaking it well? 
</P>
<P>
The time for the ceremony came. The administration thoughtfully scheduled the 
big event for mid-afternoon so that the full glory of the sun could be seen. 
After all, as one university official pointed out in a recent Times article, 
the school's acronym is C-Sun (get it?). 
</P>
<P>
The folding chairs placed on the lawn in front of the fortress-like Oviatt 
library were a fine continuation of the school's distinctive look, exemplified 
by its consistent use of creative cinder-block architecture. The lack of 
adequate seating for my parents, their obstructed view of the entire 
proceedings and their fear that Grandma might collapse in the 95-degree heat 
symbolized the struggle they went through to get me to this point. 
</P>
<P>
I barely noticed the gay surroundings, however, as my heart was pounding 
furiously. I could barely think, so affected was I at the thought of the moment 
to come. The trip to the podium itself was fraught with peril. Would I trip on 
one of the discarded liquor bottles? Would the students smoking marijuana in 
front of me collapse and prevent me from reaching the dais? Would the tennis 
balls thrown by the recreation majors, punch cards thrown by the computer 
science majors, fake money thrown by the business majors all somehow pile up 
and block the whole procession? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it didn't matter. I got up there, grabbed his hand and felt the 
energy of education, of new horizons, of fortunes to be made, of all things 
relating to knowledge flowing down his powerful arm, through my veins, straight 
into my very soul. After making sure I still had my watch, in a daze, I somehow 
stumbled off the dais and back into my chair. 
</P>
<P>
That's my story. I'm sure you can understand why I so sympathize with those 
students dead set against having graduation at a facility like the Hollywood 
Bowl -- which features a unique setting, an unobstructed view of the stage and 
comfortable seating. And who dare suggest holding the ceremony in the morning, 
when the temperature might even be bearable? Don't you remember? C-Sun? (Get 
it?) 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget the handshake. As you can tell, I'll never forget that special 
moment with Dr. Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Dean Peckham?

QUALITY OF LIFE AND TUESDAY'S ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles is in crisis. Crime has reached the doorstep of 
virtually every resident. Drive-by shootings have become an everyday occurrence 
all over town. Trash has piled up in our canyons and soon we will be forced 
into a stringent recycling program. Our freeways and major streets are 
gridlocked. The sewage system is overloaded, and our air is the filthiest in 
the nation. Developers run the city. Warner Ridge and Porter Ranch are huge 
projects that threaten to overwhelm the Valley's infrastructure, and continued 
expansion of the harbor and LAX promise to do the same to the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Who is at fault for allowing this to happen? These problems did not creep up on 
us overnight. The danger signals have been evident since the early '70s, and 
the mayor did not take heed. In fact, he has systematically made things worse. 
He has attended every photo opportunity and ribbon-cutting in town, while 
failing to confront the real issues facing the city. The mayor has been dealing 
with symptoms rather than the cause of our problems -- overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The solution to our troubles lies in controlling growth and setting limits. We 
must preserve our neighborhoods and return control of them to the residents. 
Nate Holden and other challengers have been stumping the city from San Pedro to 
Lake View Terrace and have a good grasp of the problems as well as some 
solutions worth trying. There is plenty of talent ready, willing and able to 
make this city livable again. It is time for a housecleaning at City Hall.

YAROSLAVSKY APPEARS A SHOO-IN IN 5TH DISTRICT COUNCIL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the politically ambitious and 
controversial lawmaker who has reigned over the 5th District for nearly 14 
years, appears headed for another term as Tuesday's primary approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, 40, has the support of a broad coalition of neighborhood leaders, 
environmentalists and political activists. He has also raised more than 
$215,000 for districtwide mailings, telephone banks, yard signs and other 
get-out-the-vote efforts, the latest campaign finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman, who has stressed his experience, his support for more police 
officers and his co-authorship of the city's landmark slow-growth initiative, 
is happy with his campaign, said spokeswoman Karin Caves. 
</P>
<P>
"We think things are going very well," Caves said. "Zev's very popular and 
hard-working, and he has a good record of serving his constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Yaroslavsky's three foes have tried to weaken him by 
charging that the 5th District is collapsing under the weight of commercial 
development and traffic congestion. They also contend that the councilman 
ignored the district for 18 months while exploring a possible mayoral bid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Challenger 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activist Laura M. Lake, seen as his most serious challenger, 
contends that development interests have taken precedence in communities such 
as Rancho Park, site of the Westside Pavilion mall, and Beverly-La Cienega, 
where Ma Maison Sofitel and the Beverly Center mall are. She has pledged to 
devote herself to improving the quality of peoples' lives. 
</P>
<P>
Lake is spending the final week of the campaign touring the district -- which 
includes Westwood, Century City, the Beverly-Fairfax area, West Los Angeles and 
parts of Sherman Oaks, Studio City and North Hollywood -- with a billboard on 
wheels that cites all the problems facing the district. 
</P>
<P>
Lake and her supporters have also spent the past weeks canvassing and 
telephoning voters. Campaign manager Marcela Howell said Lake, a longtime 
activist who heads Friends of Westwood and Not Yet New York and who has been 
endorsed by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and such organizations as the 
Communications Workers of America and the Westside and Sherman Oaks Democratic 
clubs, is concentrating her attention on rallying her troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole focus this week is turning out voters," Howell said. "It's a 
volatile race, and what we're hearing is that it's not a shoo-in for Zev." 
</P>
<P>
Lake's latest campaign report shows that she has raised about $100,000, far 
less than she had hoped for. But, Howell said, the campaign is receiving strong 
volunteer support. Fifty people are walking door-to-door on Lake's behalf, and 
another 25 are making telephone calls during the final days of the campaign, 
Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targeted Mailings 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is also doing some targeted mailings. "We had absolutely no 
intention of trying to match Zev dollar-for-dollar in fund raising, mail or 
anything," Howell said. "But we are getting Laura's message out." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Snyder, a 34-year-old transportation consultant with almost no money who 
has been campaigning door-to-door since August, has narrowed his focus in 
recent weeks to issues involving tenants and San Fernando Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder favors stronger rent-control protections for senior citizens. He has 
called for an end to unlimited rent increases on vacated apartments and 
advocates the replacement of affordable rental units that are demolished. 
</P>
<P>
On the Valley side of the district, Snyder is telling voters that he is 
squarely opposed to the construction of any kind of rail system. Snyder 
contends that ride-sharing, upgraded bus service, upgraded taxi service and 
other public transportation improvements would be more cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder and about 15 volunteers are also walking door-to-door, passing out 
copies of his detailed position paper on issues facing the district. In recent 
forums, Snyder has impressed many observers with his detailed knowledge of 
transportation and his ideas for improving it. He says his support is strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gained a lot of name recognition, and a lot of people have respect for 
me," Snyder said. "I may not be considered the front-runner, but I am helping 
to set the agenda. People will be surprised at how well I do." 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrath, 43, the often irreverent write-in candidate who used to work as 
Yaroslavsky's campaign manager and chief deputy, has tried to present a more 
serious message during the final weeks of the council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, the only Valley resident in the race, has keyed his message to other 
Valley residents who may be worried about gridlock and commercial growth. 
McGrath says he would prevent the level of development that has occurred in 
communities such as Westwood and the Beverly-La Cienega area. McGrath has also 
promised to provide more parking in commercial zones. 
</P>
<P>
He is spending $4,000 on cable television commercials airing during the final 
week of the campaign and is distributing 5,000 pencils that say "Write In 
McGrath." He also has an active volunteer network, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Our campaign is a street operation, and now it's being reinforced visually 
through the commercials," McGrath said. "I'm also organizing students to work 
for me on Election Day."

HOW TO HANDLE HAZARDS POSED BY 'MAGIC MINERAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asbestos has not been banned. A few uses are outlawed and others have been 
discontinued. But some asbestos products are still on the market, and most 
homes and other buildings more than 10 years old contain some asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say there are a number of things that homeowners should keep in mind 
about asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The mere presence of asbestos is not a problem. As long as asbestos materials 
are intact and unable to release lung-damaging fibers, they are safe. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is dangerous only when it is worn or damaged, or is disturbed by 
remodeling or repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting, sanding or puncturing asbestos-containing materials should be avoided. 
And homeowners should check asbestos items from time to time to make sure that 
they're in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Dust 
</P>
<P>
If debris from broken asbestos has spilled to the floor, it should be carefully 
wet mopped to avoid raising dust. It should never be swept or vacuumed, as the 
microscopic fibers may pass through the vacuum and into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing what is and isn't asbestos is the hard part. It is often found in 
insulation around pipes and near heating sources, in certain ceiling tiles and 
plasters, and in some types of floor tile. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, it has been used in hundreds of products, and few asbestos 
products are labeled as such. The manufacturer or installer may know, and 
experienced plumbers, electricians or heating contractors may make reasonable 
guesses. But the only sure way to determine the presence of asbestos is to have 
a sample tested by an analytical laboratory. These are usually listed in the 
Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
However, do not break off a hunk of suspicious-looking material just to take a 
sample. This could create a hazard that did not exist before. If the material 
is already damaged, it may be possible to gently wet it and take a small 
sample. 
</P>
<P>
It is best to call a trained professional who knows how to sample asbestos 
without raising dust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Consultants 
</P>
<P>
There are consultants who inspect and sample homes for asbestos and give advice 
on how to handle remodeling and repairs. Some advertise in the Yellow Pages and 
others are known to real estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
But asbestos consultants aren't licensed in California and should be asked to 
show proof of training. 
</P>
<P>
Professional industrial hygienists may also perform asbestos inspections. The 
American Board of Industrial Hygiene will provide a free list of members. Write 
the board at 475 Wolf Ledges Parkway, Akron, Ohio, 44311, or call (216) 
762-7294. Members must be college graduates with degrees in industrial hygiene, 
engineering or a related field with at least five years experience in 
industrial hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
Some asbestos consultants work for or with an asbestos abatement contractor who 
removes or seals asbestos. Before hiring an asbestos consultant or hygienist, 
ask that he or she disclose any such ties. 
</P>
<P>
California licenses asbestos abatement contractors, who must have at least one 
key employee pass a certification exam. Abatement contractors must also 
register with Cal-OSHA, the job safety agency, giving proof of worker training 
and safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
A list of abatement contractors in good standing can be obtained by writing the 
Contractors State License Board, Asbestos Information, Box 26000, Sacramento 
95826. A list of Cal-OSHA-registered contractors can be obtained from the 
Carcinogen Unit, California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, Box 
603, San Francisco 94101, or by calling (415) 557-2037. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor license and Cal-OSHA registration aren't guarantees of quality 
work. The skill, care and training of asbestos abatement crews varies 
considerably. Before hiring an abatement contractor, check with prior 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA and U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission can answer questions and 
provide free brochures on asbestos in the home. Write the U.S. EPA Information 
Center, 215 Fremont St., San Francisco 94105, or call (415) 974-8076. Call the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission at (213) 251-7464. MYRON LEVIN

THE LUCK OF JOHN FANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CLARK, Clark has written biographies of several American authors, 
including Damon Runyon and Jack Kerouac. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1939, the year John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" came out, three other 
novels about the downside of the California dream were also published: Raymond 
Chandler's "The Big Sleep," Nathanael West's "The Day of the Locust," and John 
Fante's "Ask the Dust." Though all four are now justly held up as American 
classics, it is Fante's book (and literary reputation) that has had the most 
catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask the Dust" is a sweet, crazy, arresting lyric poem of a novel, chronicling 
the Depression years in Los Angeles from the highly subjective, largely 
autobiographical viewpoint of one Arturo Bandini, an impoverished young writer 
holed up in a fleabag hotel on Bunker Hill. The awkward but endearing Bandini's 
desperate hankering after literary fame and his love of a Mexican waitress make 
for a book of great charm, yet, almost as if in proof of the futility of 
Bandini's romantic dreams, "Dust" fared poorly back in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Its 29-year-old Colorado-born author was the son of an immigrant Italian 
bricklayer. As a boy, John Fante had dreamed of becoming a baseball star, but 
once having followed the great wave of '30s drifters to Southern California, he 
ended up swinging away at fame with a pen instead of a bat -- and striking out 
with his best effort. "Dust" received almost no attention, partly because its 
publisher, Stackpole, was caught up at the time with a lawsuit filed by Hitler 
over an unauthorized edition of "Mein Kampf." Unpromoted, Fante's novel slipped 
quietly into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
It took until the present decade for Word-of-Mouth, that kindly goddess of lost 
books and forgotten authors, to come to the rescue. Fate's unlikely agent was 
Charles Bukowski, Los Angeles' legendary rough beast slouching toward serious 
literature. Bukowski generously gave credit to Fante and "Ask the Dust" for 
making him a writer. Finding that book in the public library, he said, had been 
like discovering gold in the city dump: "Here at last was a man who was not 
afraid of emotion," Bukowski said. "The humor and the pain were intermixed with 
a superb simplicity. The beginning of that book was a wild and enormous miracle 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bukowski's support that led indirectly to a Fante revival that's been 
one of the more surprising stories of belated success in recent publishing. A 
reference to "Ask the Dust" and to two of Fante's other books, "Dago Red" and 
"Wait Until Spring, Bandini," in the manuscript of one of Bukowski's own novels 
caught the eye of his publisher, John Martin of Black Sparrow Press. "Bandini 
was the name of a well-known brand of fertilizer," says Martin. "I thought it 
was Bukowski's idea of a joke." That was in 1978. Not until a year later did 
the publisher get around to inquiring, and learn from his author that John 
Fante was no joke. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Martin reissued "Ask the Dust." This time it caught fire and was soon 
followed by an explosion of Fante from Black Sparrow, which now offers no fewer 
than nine of the late California writer's books. These include reprints of 
several novels -- "Wait Until Spring, Bandini," "The Brotherhood of the Grape," 
"Full of Life" -- and of the early short-story collection "Dago Red" (Black 
Sparrow's expanded edition was retitled "The Wine of Youth"), as well as 
offerings of much previously unseen material. In the latter category are 
Fante's first youthful work, "The Road to Los Angeles," originally contracted 
by Knopf in 1933 but unpublished until the 1985 Black Sparrow edition; and his 
very last one, "Dreams From Bunker Hill," dictated by the writer to his wife 
Joyce from a hospital bed and released within months of his death in 1983. And 
later this year Black Sparrow will be bringing out Fante's correspondence with 
culture critic and American Mercury editor H. L. Mencken, the aspiring writer's 
first important literary contact. 
</P>
<P>
Unknown beyond a tiny English-speaking audience before 1980, Fante's work now 
can be read in French, German, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, and 
Portuguese. Seven of his novels have been optioned for movies. Currently an 
international co-production of "Wait Until Spring, Bandini," starring Faye 
Dunaway, Joe Mantegna and Ornella Muti, is being shot in Utah, while "The 
Brotherhood of the Grape" is under way as a Robert Towne/Zoetrope project, and 
"Ask the Dust," originally also optioned to Towne, is now being developed by 
Mel Brooks as an Emilio Estevez vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that Fante is not around to taste a little of the gravy. His end 
came before his new fame, after a long and difficult battle with diabetes that 
cost him his sight and legs. "Bitterness is the one thing a writer must fight," 
he told an interviewer a few years before his death. "I fought it all my life." 
</P>
<P>
It was Fante's enormous self- belief that enabled him to persevere through 
years of neglect. Like Arturo Bandini, his fictional alter ego, Fante the man 
was equal parts bravado and sensitivity. He possessed, as one friend put it, "a 
whopping appetite . . . for whatever this poor-rich earth produces," yet as he 
once told his writer friend Carey McWilliams, underneath his passion and 
avidity for life he felt "softer than a babe's skull." 
</P>
<P>
The sensitive side of his nature came through in his big-hearted stories, their 
open sentimentality redeemed by a self-deflating honesty and sense of humor. 
Notwithstanding the resemblances to his comic-populist contemporary William 
Saroyan, Fante's work probably comes closest to that of his main writing idol, 
Sherwood Anderson, whose simplicity and innocence he consciously set out to 
emulate. 
</P>
<P>
That was back in the early Depression times, when he was one of those restless 
"poor young men, touched with magic, lucky in America" whom he would write 
about in his novel "1933 Was a Bad Year." By 1933, Fante had dropped out of the 
University of Colorado and hitchhiked to Los Angeles. He immediately fell in 
love with this city of broken dreams and forever vanishing muses, which he 
invoked longingly in "Ask the Dust": "You sad flower in the sand, you pretty 
town. . . ." But his own existence in Lotusland, as he later told McWilliams, 
added up to no more than "a driveling sort of life . . . whores, hostesses, 
Plymouths, Pontiacs, and then hamburgers." Pickup jobs on the docks and in the 
fish canneries paid for precious free hours, which he devoted to writing, 
spinning out stories about his Catholic childhood and the poor people among 
whom he lived and worked. 
</P>
<P>
The longed-for lucky break came in 1932, when Mencken accepted Fante's tale 
"Altar Boy" for the American Mercury, and adopted him as protege. Before long 
there came that ill-fated Knopf contract, arranged by Mencken. The 24-year-old 
Fante, then employed as a busboy in an L.A. barbecue joint, became a 15-second 
celebrity in his new hometown. His photo appeared in the Los Angeles Examiner 
for Aug. 7, 1933, captioned "Literary Dish Juggler." 
</P>
<P>
But his season in the limelight proved all too brief. After the debacle at 
Knopf and with his several Stackpole books not selling, Fante turned away from 
fiction to a career in screenwriting in the 1940s. He put in time at Warner 
Bros., where he became a drinking partner of fellow script hack William 
Faulkner. In the '50s and '60s, he moved from studio to studio as a contract 
writer, picking up credits on such pictures as "Jeanne Eagels," "A Walk on the 
Wild Side," "My Six Loves," and "The Reluctant Saint." 
</P>
<P>
Movie work paid the bills but brought great personal frustration for Fante the 
stifled artist. "That I worked as a screenwriter is treated as if I had had a 
bout with the clap," Fante complained to McWilliams in 1972. "If, on the other 
hand, I had pumped gas instead, or been a bricklayer, the ensuing glamor would 
have immortalized me." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have known it at the time, but the thing that will immortalize John 
Fante is the thing he cared most about, his "real" writing.

SECOND CHANCES Men, Women and Children a Decade After Divorce by Judith S. 
Wallerstein with Sandra Blakeslee (Ticknor &amp; Fields: $19.95; 329 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
When he first arrived at Judith Wallerstein's Marin County Center for the 
Family in ransition shortly after his parents' divorce, six-year-old John 
wouldn't say a word, preferring to gather baby dolls in the center's play-room. 
Setting the dolls firmly on their feet, he placed miniature tables, chairs and 
beds on their heads. On the steep roof of a nearby dollhouse, he then put 
mother and father dolls in precarious positions, gently catching each one as it 
began sliding off the roof. "Are the babies the strongest?" Wallerstein asked. 
"Yes," John shouted excitedly. "The babies are holding up the world." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to underestimate the burdens lying on children's slender shoulders 
after their parents' divorce, for years often pass before any sign of emotional 
trauma appears in the form of anger, promiscuity, depression or fears of 
abandonment and betrayal. Children have difficulty discussing divorce, 
Wallerstein suggests in this provocative book, based on a 15-year study of 60 
families, because it so deeply threatens their sense of identity. Children 5-8 
tend to feel personally rejected by divorce, Wallerstein contends, for they are 
unable to conceive of a larger social world in which decisions are made 
independently of them. Children between 9 and 12, on the other hand, are 
beginning to widen their social circle, envisioning the family not as a world 
of its own but as a stage on which they perform for the world. And so, while 
divorce tends to trigger feelings of inadequacy among younger children, older 
children are more likely to feel anger, for their parents have removed their 
stage, the foundation for their sense of self. 
</P>
<P>
In proposing solutions to these and related problems, Wallerstein avoids doling 
out the painfully obvious advice that makes so many self-help books seem 
condescending. While not faulting the institution of divorce, "a useful and 
necessary social remedy," she suggests that parents' understandable urge to 
spare the details from their children is misguided. "Children have a right to 
understand why the divorce is happening (for they) cannot mobilize their 
energies to cope with a crisis that they do not comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
Early reviews have criticized Wallerstein for failing to follow children from 
happily married families to see if they too suffer from the feelings of 
alienation, apathy and loneliness she attributes to divorce. This criticism is 
in part valid, for her subjects often are not as atypical as she makes them out 
to be; one-fourth of the children in her study, for example, become sexually 
active in junior high school, not an unusually high figure for the general 
population. Wallerstein's decision to limit her study to 60 families she could 
get to know well imbues this book with a level of intuitive sophistication, 
however, that would have been impossible to achieve had she taken on a more 
weighty and impersonal study based on telephone or mail surveys.

<P>
THE SOCIETY OF SIX by Nancy Boas (Bedford Arts: $39.95; 224 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
These six young, bold artists working in Oakland in the 1910s and '20s have 
often been called "landscape painters," but their work is considerably more 
sophisticated than that of mid-19th Century realists, for rather than 
faithfully and "objectively" depicting the environment, their art reflects a 
more modernist conflict between inner and outer landscapes. At their best, the 
"Oakland Six" use deep and dreamy hues of red, blue and gold not only to 
express their love of the land but to portray its pristine beauty as a form of 
spiritual purity that is often beyond human attaining. 
</P>
<P>
By showing how the society's paintings presaged modernism, Nancy Boas hopes to 
bring them out of the basements to which they were relegated after being 
dismissed as derivative. Isolated from European and New England culture, the 
Oakland Six didn't learn French Impressionist techniques until an exposition 
traversed mountains and deserts to reach the Bay Area in 1915. By then, 
however, mainstream artists already were moving on to newer forms of 
expression. Even so, the society innovated substantially beyond Impressionism, 
Boas argues, pioneering a rapid, raw, coarse and boldly subjective style that 
became our country's first distinctly original contribution to visual art. 
</P>
<P>
The work reproduced here in color ranges from intense evocations of the Old 
West -- Seldon Gile's "A Pueblo, Arizona" for instance, is a composite of 
bright orange masses that are on the verge, as Boas writes, "of exploding into 
pure light" -- to August Gay's more introspective studies of troubled psyches 
in tranquil environments. Gay's "Stevenson House," for instance, suggests a 
world that is outwardly beautiful, but inwardly threatening: a tranquil, pastel 
building lies in the background, while in the foreground, the spreading 
branches of a tree seem to shatter the composition like glass.

right. "The tranquil beauty of Monterey is here transformed to mirror a sense 
of Gay's personal turmoil," Boas writes. "Forms press and crowd each other, 
clouds mass behind dark trees, walls bulge, and painted shapes vibrate."

<P>
to the man who brought her here. 
</P>
<P>
He slams the truck's good door 
</P>
<P>
and lifts the hood. 
</P>
<P>
The men talk, 
</P>
<P>
looking at the ground

I was thrilled to read your article about Will James, "Endpapers: Come Back,

know about his sad fate in life having died so young by drinking himself to 
death.

I just happen to have in my possession "Smokey, the Cowhorse"! The book has to 
be about 44 to 45 years old. It is in pretty good condition considering how

Mr. Love, you have made me happy also to read about something that brought back 
so many memories of my dear, beloved dad who has now left me many years ago,

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA BY GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ; 
TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH BY EDITH GROSSMAN (PENGUIN BOOKS: $8.95) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This extraordinary novel, rivaled only by Gabriel Garcia Marquez's unparalleled 
"One Hundred Years of Solitude," won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for 
fiction in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Florentino Ariza's love for Fermina Daza has lasted, largely unrequited, for 51 
years, nine months and four days. As a teen-ager he falls in love with her from 
a distance, and they begin a passionate correspondence. But Fermina's father 
breaks off their epistolary courtship by sending Fermina to live with distant 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her return, Fermina falls in love instead with the more urbane and 
aristocratic Juvenal Urbino, the town's leading physician, who develops 
numerous cures for the cholera epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
Fermina marries Juvenal and their marriage is mostly happy. But it is 
Florentino's passion for Fermina, which endures 50 years of neglect and 
indifference, that is at the heart of this wonderful novel. Garcia Marquez's 
story of a love that flowers only in old age is achingly beautiful, comic and 
timeless.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: "SURELY YOU'RE JOKING, MR. FEYNMAN!" ADVENTURES OF A 
CURIOUS CHARACTER BY RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, AS TOLD TO RALPH LEIGHTON; EDITED BY 
EDWARD HUTCHINGS (BANTAM BOOKS: $8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Richard P. Feynman, the late, world-renowned physicist with a passion for 
puzzle-solving and for making mischief, received the call at 4 in the morning 
telling him that he had won the 1965 Nobel Prize for physics, his reaction was 
to say, "Yeah, but I'm sleeping !" By the fifth or sixth call he told the 
reporter from Time magazine, "I don't know how to get out of this thing. Maybe 
I won't accept the prize." But the combustible curmudgeon eventually relented. 
</P>
<P>
In "Surely You're Joking," Feynman tells stories of his childhood in Far 
Rockaway, of his studies at MIT and Princeton, of his experience on the 
Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, of his work as professor at Cornell and 
Caltech and of his research in theoretical physics. 
</P>
<P>
Feynman's indefatigable enthusiasm for solving puzzles, whether deciphering 
Mayan hieroglyphics, cracking high-security safes in Los Alamos or solving the 
mystery of liquid helium is consistently and utterly infectious.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WHY AMERICANS DON'T VOTE BY FRANCES FOX PIVEN AND RICHARD 
A. CLOWARD (PANTHEON BOOKS: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of the eligible voters participated in the presidential 
election of 1988, the second-lowest voter turnout in the 20th Century. As 
Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward argue in this illuminating examination, 
the cause was not a lack of real issues but that campaign advertising men, 
whose strategies are directed toward "the limited universe of 'probable 
voters,' " ignored the existing "interests . . . of the non-voting half of the 
electorate": the undereducated and unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the political party machines "refuse to mobilize potential black 
or Hispanic voters for fear of fueling racial challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Piven and Cloward advocate registration reform moving toward a system of 
comprehensive national registration along European lines. In 1982, the authors 
formed an organization (Human Service Employees' Registration and Voter 
Education Campaign, or Human SERVE) to enlist public and nonprofit groups to 
make registration forms universally available -- at motor vehicle bureaus, 
day-care centers, senior citizen centers, unemployment and welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
These efforts reached fruition in the states of Texas, Ohio, New York, Montana, 
New Mexico and West Virginia at the respective governors' orders. But the most 
chilling response to the project was a harsh reprimand from the Reagan 
Administration. The director of the Office of Personnel Management, Donald 
Devine, claimed that this work represented a misuse of state personnel and 
questioned the effect of increased voter registration on the election of 
November, 1984. The authors write: "Devine was subsequently denied 
reconfirmation by the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
An important and fascinating analysis.

THE CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
CITY ELECTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RACE THAT STARTED AS INTENSE CONTEST ENDS IN EASY WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles municipal election campaign that began with prospects of a 
citywide debate on growth, traffic, pollution, poverty and crime ends Tuesday 
in a series of one-sided races that seem to have stirred little enthusiasm 
among the voters. 
</P>
<P>
As the year began, chances for an intense discussion of the future of the city 
were bright. 
</P>
<P>
The agenda was laid out late in 1988 by the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, 
composed of business, political and community leaders and academics. In a 
report called LA 2000, the committee called for new structures of government to 
prevent the Los Angeles area from becoming "a balkanized landscape of political 
fortresses, each guarding its own resources in the midst of divisiveness, 
overcrowded freeways, antiquated sewers, ineffective schools, inadequate human 
services and a polluted environment." 
</P>
<P>
An ambitious Los Angeles city councilman, Zev Yaroslavsky, armed with more than 
$1 million in campaign funds, was promising a mayoral campaign run on just 
those issues. "Are you safer in your neighborhood than you were five years 
ago?" he asked at a fund-raising event for his anticipated mayoral campaign. 
"Are the streets and highways you drive on less congested . . . is the air you 
breathe (safer) and is the water off our coast safer to swim in?" 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Tom Bradley inherited an apparently easy ride to reelection in 
January, when Yaroslavsky dropped out after public opinion polls persuaded him 
the mayor was unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley remains heavily favored for a fifth term despite facing questions in 
the last two weeks over revelations that he earned up to $24,000 a year for 
serving as director of a savings and loan and $18,000 -- which he later 
returned -- as an adviser to a bank. Both financial institutions did business 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of Bradley's foes, City Councilman Nate Holden, has vigorously 
campaigned citywide -- and he is badly handicapped by lack of funds and a late 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the eight Los Angeles City Council members up for election -- Marvin 
Braude of Brentwood and the Pacific Palisades and Gloria Molina, a central city 
lawmaker -- have no opposition at all. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the eastern San 
Fernando Valley, is the only candidate that political analysts say may fall 
below the 50% margin election night and be forced into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, deciding to remain in his Westside City Council seat, has faced 
scrappy and loud opposition candidates, whose campaigns have cited the warnings 
of the LA 2000 report. But he is favored to win Tuesday. So is Councilman 
Michael Woo of the Hollywood-Hollywood Hills area, who also has contentious 
opponents who have raised the same issues. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Lindsay, representing South-Central neighborhoods containing some of 
the city's poorest residents, is considered safe, as is Joan Milke Flores, 
whose constituency includes South-Central's poor and harbor area homeowners who 
have expressed unhappiness with the quality of Los Angeles life. Complaints of 
traffic, unrestricted growth and congestion have been raised against 
Councilwoman Joy Picus in the West San Fernando Valley, but she, too, is 
expected by her supporters to win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Profile Races 
</P>
<P>
There are closer contests in elections for three of the seven seats on the 
board of the 646-school Los Angeles Unified School District. In these races, 
the teachers' union is trying to gain a board majority sympathetic to its 
demands for better pay and more say for teachers in education matters. But 
campaign consultants involved in those races say interest among voters seems 
generally low. 
</P>
<P>
The contests for three seats on the Los Angeles Community College Board are 
even more low profile. The only incumbent in the race, attorney Lindsay Conner, 
has no opposition, and candidates for the two open seats have not generated 
widespread attention for their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn faces no opposition and City Controller 
Rick Tuttle is expected to win easily. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot are four Los Angeles city bond issues and two amendments to 
the City Charter. Only two of these propositions -- bonds for libraries and for 
police facilities -- have active campaign organizations behind them. Others 
call for bonds to finance loans to improve old low-cost housing and to finance 
installation of sprinklers in city-owned high-rise buildings. The two City 
Charter amendments would change procedures for transferring money within a city 
department and for enacting employee pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
None of the six propositions has organized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Bradley spoke at a rally at his Crenshaw District headquarters and 
from a motorcade in a convertible that moved through the streets of 
South-Central Los Angeles. But the streets were empty in the noon-day heat. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank issue continued to follow Bradley, with reporters 
questioning him about it while he campaigned. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley criticized news coverage of the issue when he was asked about a story 
in The Times that Far East National Bank held about $500,000 in Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency funds last year, when Bradley was a paid special 
adviser to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was clear from the article that the bank had been receiving 
investments from the city since 1962," he said. "I know nothing about that. 
That's a matter of the treasurer or the agency making the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the important question, which somehow the reporters refuse to 
raise, is did I exert influence or even ask the treasurer to deposit a dime, 
any money, in any of the banks of the city and the answer is 'No, no, no.' I 
wish somehow you would get that message across rather than picking on some 
contradiction or some speculation that the reporters seem to raise." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bradley has admitted he did telephone City Treasurer Leonard 
Rittenberg last month to inquire about city investment policies after the mayor 
received a phone call from Harold Hwang, president of Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang called, Bradley said, to inquire about rumors that the city was planning 
to drop its policy of depositing its funds in local banks. 
</P>
<P>
After that conversation, the city doubled its deposit in Far East to $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has consistently denied that there was any relationship between the 
telephone conversation and the doubling of the Far East deposit. However, in an 
interview with The Times on Tuesday, he admitted that he had asked Rittenberg 
if "had they (Far East) in the past" held city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
That, Bradley said, was merely, "for the purpose of confirming the statement 
that had been made to me that they did have deposits." Bradley said he then 
returned to the bank all the consulting fees he received in 1988 along with a 
letter saying his relationship with the bank had ended in December. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's aides have objected to an account of Tuesday's interview in The 
Times, which indicated that Bradley did not sever his relations with Far East 
until after last month's conversation with Rittenberg. Press secretary Dee Dee 
Myers said Bradley had quit the bank last December. But she said the action was 
done verbally and not documented. 
</P>
<P>
Holden also made campaign appearances. Earlier in the week, his campaign mailed 
out pamphlets to about 500,000 homes. Republicans got a pamphlet showing him 
with GOP Gov. George Deukmejian. Democrats on the Westside received a pamphlet 
with a picture of him and popular area legislators. And in black areas, the 
pamphlets had a picture of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, too, campaigned through the mails. But there was no indication that 
this last-minute flurry would result in a big increase in voter interest. The 
only polling in the race has been done privately for some of the candidates. As 
a result, there is no firm estimate of voter interest -- or reliable estimate 
of turnout. 
</P>
<P>
But primary election turnouts in Los Angeles have been dropping over the years. 
In 1973, when Bradley and then-Mayor Sam Yorty were locked in an intense 
contest, 60% of the registered voters went to the polls. In 1977, when Bradley 
faced state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) in what was expected to be a close 
race, it was 42%. But it dropped to 37% when Bradley was favored in a rematch 
with Yorty in 1981 and to 35% in his strong 1985 election victory over City 
Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
And reporters who have been covering the campaign have seen small turnouts -- 
20, 30, 35 people -- at candidates' forums all over the city. In addition, the 
discussions at these meetings have been locally oriented: the proposed trolley 
line through the Valley, planned destruction of homes to make way for new 
South-Central Los Angeles schools, dangerous intersections, overdevelopment in 
the Westwood area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Turnouts 
</P>
<P>
While of vital importance to the neighborhoods involved, these meetings have 
not produced much broad debate or even an examination of the regional concerns 
raised by the LA 2000 report. 
</P>
<P>
In March, about 35 people gathered at a community center in Van Nuys to hear 
the mayoral candidates. The audience was small at the Saturday afternoon forum, 
even though it was sponsored by every major homeowner organization in the area. 
Bradley skipped it, as he has done with other forums. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, two dozen people attending a candidates' forum in Pacoima 
barely outnumbered the candidates and their families. Pacoima, a poor, black 
and Latino section of the San Fernando Valley, is hard hit by crime and 
poverty. Reporters covering the area have found deep community concern about 
these issues. But those attending the session heard few specific solutions. 
Again, Bradley did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomenon has been observed in Hollywood, the harbor area and in 
other parts of the city.

Political analysts offered a number of reasons, ranging from the reluctance of 
political office holders to gamble on losing their present jobs by running for 
higher office, to a feeling on the part of voters that present governmental 
structures cannot solve the complex problems of the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"There is low turnout because there is little competition," said Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe, senior associate at the Center For Politics and Policy of the Claremont 
Graduate School. As an example she cited Yaroslavsky, who would have had to 
give up his council seat to run against Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"What Zev typifies is the new breed of full-time politician, professional 
politicians, whose only career is the office they hold," she said. "This 
professionalism has come down to the local level. We see people whose first 
goal, whose only priority, is to maintain the job they have. They are loath to 
risk that job, so they are more inclined to stay in place. 
</P>
<P>
"If Zev's seat were not up, he would be in the race, and at this point in time 
he would have had a decent opportunity to make a dent." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Weinstein, dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban 
Planning, and a member of the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, said one reason for 
low participation is the fragmented nature of the region's system of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the political landscape is so complicated and so overlapping and 
divided into so many smaller pieces that I think it is hard for the electorate 
to think that any election is so consequential because they know the 
accountability is too complex and diffused," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The aggregate experience of the average citizen is that he can't figure out 
who the hell to blame or who the hell to reward," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, he said, that interest in elections, particularly statewide 
balloting, often centers on initiative races. "Nobody is going to pass the 
buck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Political science Prof. Bruce Cain of Caltech said he shares that view. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responsibility Unclear 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic, pollution, toxic cleanups, the bay, a lot of these issues are not the 
single responsibility of any one single level of government or any individual," 
he said. "As a result, there is enough ambiguity of responsibility so that 
those who are responsible can be deft enough to make sure they do not shoulder 
the blame." 
</P>
<P>
Cain also said low interest can be blamed on the change in local politics, from 
low-budget campaigns run by friends and conducted door to door to expensive 
operations dependent on mass mailings that require computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a political system that depends on mass communications and money 
rather than the localization of politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of politics depends on money, and big contributors give to those in 
power -- the incumbents, he said. "There has been a movement away from precinct 
organization, get-out-the vote kind of things. These were labor intensive, done 
by activists. Campaigns are now run by consultants, not amateur activists." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason was offered by Alan Heslop, who heads the Rose Institute of 
Claremont-McKenna College, a political think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said that City Council districts, like legislative districts, are drawn 
so awkwardly -- to preserve the advantage of incumbents -- that voters have 
little sense of their elected representatives. 
</P>
<P>
These districts, with boundaries carefully drawn to preserve incumbents' 
strength, ignore communities, and make communications within them difficult, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop, however, said there could be a rise in interest after the 1990 Census, 
which he, and others, predict will show a sharp increase in Latinos and Asians 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Those Census findings, he said, will require a major reapportionment of the 
City Council and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seats. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, incumbents will be threatened, elections will tighten up and 
voter participation will increase, he said.

Nine people, including a woman pushing a baby stroller and a family leaving a 
convenience store, were among the wounded in a spate of shootings that also 
left a 13-year-old boy who was playing with a shotgun dead, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Angelina Rojas, 31, and her daughters Maria, 6, and Bertha, 7, were wounded 
Friday at a 7-Eleven store in Long Beach when the store's clerk fired at a 
customer who had allegedly threatened him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk, Aoina Uiagalelei, surrendered to police hours later and was booked 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Lt. Melvin Galwas said. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas and her children and the customer targeted by Uiagalelei, Robin Byrd, 32, 
were treated at a local hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Guerrero, 27, was wounded in the arm Friday as she pushed a stroller 
carrying her 1-year-old baby and her 3-year-old child on Van Nuys Boulevard in 
Pacoima, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness said the suspects were shooting at a passing vehicle allegedly 
carrying rival street gang members when they hit Guerrero, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero was treated at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley and 
released. The children were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested Herman Robinson, 19, of Pacoima on suspicion of assault with 
a deadly weapon. A second suspect remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
In other incidents: 
</P>
<P>
* Jonathan Baron, 36, of Redondo Beach was shot and critically wounded as he 
walked to his car inside a parking structure on Hawthorne Boulevard in 
Torrance, Lt. Mike Tamble said. Baron was listed in critical condition at 
UCLA-Harbor General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
* A 17-year-old boy was in critical condition Saturday after being wounded in 
the head in a gang-related drive-by shooting in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was standing with five to eight fellow gang members in front of a 
party at a home in the 200 block of North Chicago Street when members of a 
rival gang drove by and gang slogans were shouted from the car, Los Angeles 
Police Detective Larry Martinez said. No arrests had been made Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
* A 13-year-old boy died after being accidentally shot in the back while he and 
three friends were playing with a loaded shotgun in a house in Watts, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Antoine Pierce, who lived in the Nickerson Gardens housing project, died at 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. While one boy was holding the gun, 
it discharged and Pierce was fatally wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
* A 21-year-old man was shot in the buttocks as he tried to run from gang 
members at Gladstone's for Fish, a popular seafood restaurant in Pacific 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
* On Saturday afternoon, an unidentified ice cream man was shot in the abdomen 
and drove his truck to a South-Central Los Angeles police station for help, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old driver was shot by two men at 104th Street and Broadway, Sgt. 
Lon Salzman said. He was scheduled to undergo surgery at King Hospital.

HEAT EASES -- BUT IT'S STILL NOT LIKE APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's record-shattering heat wave loosened its grip Saturday, 
but even relatively cooler weather meant highs in the 90s in inland areas, 
another all-time high for the date at the Los Angeles Civic Center and a "smog 
attack" at the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the worst is over," said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "It looks like the 
high-pressure system over the Great Basin is breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
The weather system moved eastward, lessening its ability to bedevil Southern 
Californians with a flood of air that heats by compression on its way to the 
coast. That Santa Ana condition produced four days of temperatures in the 100s 
in Los Angeles and made El Toro in Orange County the hottest spot in the nation 
with 112 degrees on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures Saturday were still about 20 degrees above normal for this time of 
year. At the Civic Center, the high of 91 was 2 degrees warmer than the 
previous record high of 89 set in 1899 and tied in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann predicted that today would be more comfortable, with highs in the 60s 
and 70s near the coast, in the low to mid-90s in the warmest inland valley and 
in the mid-80s at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast through Monday calls for sunny days and fair nights, with a few 
morning coastal low clouds. 
</P>
<P>
At White Memorial Medical Center on the Eastside, a Boyle Heights woman, who 
was hospitalized with an elevated temperature and fast pulse Friday evening, 
died of apparent cardiac arrest, a hospital spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing Supervisor Mary Latner said that while the heat "certainly didn't help" 
Barbara Zavaleta, 50, it was not possible to determine whether it contributed 
to her death. An autopsy is pending, Latner said. 
</P>
<P>
While Saturday's skies were generally sunny and blue, smog stained metropolitan 
Los Angeles, the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, the Riverside-San Bernardino 
areas and -- in a reversal of the usual pattern -- the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a smog attack," said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Don 
Rohrer, who commands a beach area running from Marina del Rey to Topanga. "All 
that smog that's blown off the city is hovering over the beach here. It's a 
condition that we don't face often. Visibility is down to about a mile and a 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the smog, however, Rohrer said more than 100,000 beach-goers had 
thronged into his area to enjoy 80-degree temperatures and water temperatures 
in the low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, Lt. Roger Smith estimated that 100,000 more people had crowded 
beaches from Topanga to the Ventura County line. To the south, Capt. Steve 
Voorhees expected 200,000 to jam the oceanfront from Playa del Rey to Cabrillo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Patients were cooler at the UCLA Medical Center, where a fire Thursday night 
knocked out air conditioning for the hospital. Spokesman Rick Elbaum said the 
patient areas were "almost back to normal" on Saturday.

THE CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN;

SCHOOL BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS UNION CALLS OUT TROOPS FOR 2 CANDIDATES

More than 100 campaign volunteers, most of them classroom teachers, fanned out 
along the western flank of the city Saturday as part of a final door-to-door 
push to change the political balance of the Los Angeles Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to secure a majority of trustees more supportive of its contract demands 
and classroom concerns, the 22,000-member United Teachers-Los Angeles helped 
turn out the small brigade of troops for two candidates, incumbent Julie 
Korenstein in the West San Fernando Valley and challenger Mark Slavkin on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Critics warn that the aggressive teachers union and its spitfire president, 
Wayne Johnson, want control over the governing board of the nation's 
second-largest school system at a time when teachers are embroiled in a bitter 
contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a power play," said state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig. Honig 
has endorsed Westside incumbent Alan Gershman, who has been targeted for defeat 
by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson insists that the union only wants a board more attentive to teachers' 
needs, both economic and professional. That theme was echoed Saturday by many 
of the rank-and-file instructors who showed up to help their candidates despite 
a record-setting heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to have some changes," said Lois Biscoe, who joined about 75 other 
district teachers at Slavkin's Sawtelle-area headquarters. "I want some help 
for teachers. Some practical help." 
</P>
<P>
About 45 volunteers, many of them teachers, also set out Saturday morning from 
a Northridge home to walk door to door for Korenstein. The day's effort brought 
to several hundred the volunteers Slavkin and Korenstein have been able to put 
in the field and on phones in recent weeks with the union's help. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Rosen-Kaplan, a Korenstein volunteer and Birmingham High School English 
teacher, said Saturday that she is helping the campaign because "there is a 
tremendous amount at stake" in the election. "The contract must be settled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Seats 
</P>
<P>
Three board seats are at stake in a campaign whose big issues have been the 
ongoing teacher contract fight, campus crime, the efficiency of the district's 
$3.5-billion-a-year budget and how best to increase the say of parents and 
teachers in running neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
While making endorsements in two of the races, the teachers union has remained 
neutral in the third, where longtime incumbent Roberta Weintraub is seeking 
reelection in an East San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershman-Slavkin race is largely a two-way contest, while Korenstein, a 
liberal Democrat, is facing formidable challenges from two conservatives, 
Principal Gerald Horowitz and parent activist Barbara Romey. 
</P>
<P>
If both Slavkin and Korenstein win, four of the seven board members will be 
close allies. 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute volunteer efforts like Saturday's may prove important in this 
low-interest, relatively low-budget election because of new state limits on 
political fund raising. The voter-approved reforms greatly restrict the ability 
of UTLA or other large contributors to pump last-minute funds into the 
campaigns to pay for large mailings. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasted with the general emphasis on grass-roots politics, incumbent 
Gershman, who has run a low-profile campaign despite raising more money than 
his opponent, has had no organized phoning or precinct walking campaign and 
apparently made no major public appearances on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The only candidate who appeared to come close to the union-backed volunteer 
effort on the final weekend was Horowitz, a popular Sun Valley junior high 
school principal who had about 40 volunteers signed up Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with campaign literature, pre-written pitches and computer printouts 
directing them to the homes of the most likely voters, the Slavkin workers set 
out Saturday ringing doorbells from Venice to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
However, what they often ran into were barking dogs, empty homes or people who 
knew little or nothing about the school board election. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to vote without knowing a lot about it," one elderly Wellworth Avenue 
resident told teacher Geri Thigpen, who was working a Westwood neighborhood for 
Slavkin. The woman expressed a vague concern that Gershman had not been doing 
enough, but she also seemed troubled by not knowing much about his challenger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Light Conversation 
</P>
<P>
Following instructions she received at campaign headquarters, Thigpen kept the 
conversation light, with no talk of labor-management beefs or school spending 
priorities. "He's a very nice young man," Thigpen said of Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the hesitant woman said she would "probably" be voting for Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein's volunteers have for more than a month been phoning every day, 
whittling down huge stacks of computerized phone lists targeting Democrats, 
senior citizens, parents and voters who have a record of casting ballots in 
off-year elections, said Jo Seidita, coordinator of Korenstein's volunteer 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Fisher, a studio prop master by trade and the regional vice chairman of 
the Los Angeles Democratic Party in charge of the San Fernando Valley, said 
that for Korenstein "it's the phone bank that is going to win it." 
</P>
<P>
Gershman, a former teacher and education consultant, has run on his record, 
generally defended the district's instructional and management efforts and 
charged that his opponent is a political opportunist with no qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrats 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin, a political aide for county Supervisor Ed Edelman, charges that 
Gershman is too close to the district's "fat-cat" administrators. Gershman and 
Slavkin are liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, a single mother with two grown children and a 13-year-old son, had 
hoped to portray herself as the board member who is "shaking things up" at the 
district headquarters downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But in appearances at several candidate forums, Korenstein has been forced to 
defend district programs considered generally unpopular with conservative West 
Valley voters, such as bilingual education and a counseling program for gay and 
lesbian students. Her five challengers have also sought to blame growing campus 
violence and declining academic performance on Korenstein.

TAX EXECUTIVE SHOT TWICE AT TORRANCE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A vice president of a major Torrance tax preparation company was in very 
critical but stable condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center on Saturday night 
after undergoing surgery for gunshot wounds he suffered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Baron was shot by a lone gunman in the parking garage at the company's 
new high-rise headquarters at Torrance and Hawthorne boulevards shortly after 6 
p.m. Friday, Torrance police said. 
</P>
<P>
They said they had no motive in the attack on Baron, 36, of Redondo Beach. He 
is an executive of CCH Computax Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Police Lt. Mike Dersham said, "Robbery was definitely not a motive" 
because Baron "had all of his property." Police said Baron was returning to his 
car when he was confronted by the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
They said they were looking for an Asian male, 18 to 25 years old, with black 
hair and glasses, who was believed to be driving a 1978 to 1982 white four-door 
General Motors auto. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Rolfe, president of CCH Computax, said he had been told that three 
shots were fired at Baron while he stood on the first floor of the parking 
structure and that he was hit once in the chest and once in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely no idea" why Baron was shot, Rolfe said. "We have no 
understanding of why. There doesn't appear to be any motive on the surface. The 
reaction of most of our people is that it was some kind of a drive-by." 
</P>
<P>
Rolfe said Baron is vice president in charge of product development at 
Computax, a computerized income tax processing company. Baron has worked for 
the firm for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a first-class individual all the way around," Rolfe said.

BEVERLY INTRODUCES BILL TO AID CARD-CLUB CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Southland city managers seeking an overhaul of the state's 
century-old gambling law has persuaded a state lawmaker to take up their cause. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Robert A. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) said he has introduced a bill 
that was drafted over the past four months by the city managers of Gardena, 
Bell, Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, and Commerce -- where the Southland's 
seven card clubs are located. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, city officials said last week, could settle a dispute over three 
high-stakes Asian betting games. For the past four years, since pai-gow, Asian 
poker and super pan 9 were introduced in the card clubs, the games have 
generated up to 50% of the clubs' yearly revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversy Generated 
</P>
<P>
But they also have brought repeated disputes between card club owners and law 
enforcement officials, who contend that the games violate the 1891 gambling 
law. Sheriff's deputies closed down the games for several days early this year. 
The controversy also has generated lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly said last week that he was willing to sponsor the city managers' bill 
because of the continued debates over the wording of the law, which sheriff's, 
city and card club officials call archaic. 
</P>
<P>
But, he conceded, it is not his most pressing issue since none of the cities he 
represents allow gambling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Priority Item 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a priority item," Beverly said. "(But), there's been a constant 
struggle over what games can be played (in card clubs)." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly said his office, which is juggling more than 30 bills, has made no 
effort to lobby for the gambling-law revision. Beverly was contacted about the 
issue last month by Joseph A. Gonsalves, a lobbyist for the cities of Commerce, 
Bell Gardens and Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, said Bell Gardens City Manager Claude Booker, coalition members 
are confident that Beverly, a 20-year veteran of state government and former 
city official, could be influential in transforming the bill into law. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a friend of city government," Booker said, who with Commerce City Manager 
Louis Shepard has been lobbying for passage of the bill. Shepard went to 
Sacramento recently to seek the support of the League of California Cities, 
which has yet to respond, Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
In Gardena, Assistant City Manager Mitchell Lansdell said he is less certain 
about the bill's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, legislation has gotten as far as being introduced, but something 
always fell through," Lansdell said. "We certainly favor some kind of 
legislation, but whether this is the right piece or not we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The bill is under review by the Senate Governmental Organizational Committee 
and will be ready for hearings by May 9, said Joshua Pane, a spokesman for 
Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, it would replace the existing gambling law, which consists of one 
paragraph with a detailed description of seven games that are allowed in the 
state. It also would define disputed terms, such as banking, percentage and 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant aspect of the 11-page, compromise bill, supporters say, is 
that it would outlaw pai-gow, played with tiles instead of playing cards. The 
game, played at all seven of the casinos, has been the greatest source of 
controversy between law enforcement officials and card club operators. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, however, would allow super pan 9 and Asian poker, which are 
derivatives of pai-gow, but are played with cards instead of tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The other games listed in the proposed bill are: draw poker, panguingue 
(similar to super pan 9), seven-card stud poker and hold-em poker. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the California Police Officers 
Assn. have opposed pai-gow because it is played with a rotating dealer. The 
dealer, who also serves as a banker by controlling the betting, has an unfair 
advantage over other players, sheriff's spokesmen contend. 
</P>
<P>
But card club owners and city officials support the game, saying that since 
every player has a chance to become the "rotating dealer," or banker, the 
advantage is neutralized. The current law outlaws banking games but does not 
define what they are. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of the five cities began drafting proposed changes in the 
gambling law after sheriff's deputies raided six of the card clubs during the 
New Year's weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department closed down tables where the Asian games were being 
played until casino and Bell Gardens attorneys persuaded Superior Court Judge 
Kurt Lewin to issue a temporary restraining order barring deputies from further 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The games are being played under an extension of that order until a lawsuit 
against the Sheriff's Department can be heard later this year.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: 'IF YOU DON'T TEACH KIDS HOW TO BE AN AUDIENCE NOW, THERE 
WON'T BE ANY IN 20 YEARS.'

When is music like baseball? 
</P>
<P>
When it's Maurice Ravel's "Bolero," and it's being used to introduce elementary 
school children to the instruments of the symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Ravel heard a Spanish dance tune that he liked a lot and thought he'd give all 
the instruments a chance to get up to bat, to be a soloist," Frances Steiner 
said Friday morning from the stage of the Carson Community Center, looking out 
at a sea of fourth- and fifth-graders seated in the enormous room. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these soloists are like players in the dugout," the conductor of the 
Carson-Dominguez Hills Symphony Orchestra went on to say. "They all play 
eventually, but some have to wait a long time." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Bolero," the first batter is the snare drum, which sets the 
rhythmic piece in motion. One by one, the flutes, clarinets, bassoons, 
saxophones and other instruments take up the melody. 
</P>
<P>
This is one way to get the attention of a young audience, and Steiner has been 
doing it for 14 years in an annual youth concert -- actually, three programs in 
a single morning that draw up to 3,000 children from the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's 14 elementary schools in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"They have so little exposure to fine arts and music and this is one small 
thing I can do about it," said Steiner, who also is a music professor at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. The university and the city of Carson jointly sponsor 
the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner said she aims the hourlong programs at fourth- and fifth-graders 
because they are at the age when they have opportunities to begin learning to 
play instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of the kids, these concerts are a positive, happy experience," she 
said. "For one or two, they might inspire an interest in music." 
</P>
<P>
She told of a student who plays string bass at the university who discovered 
the instrument at a Carson youth concert. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important part of the cultural program in our schools," said 
Georgia Otto, music adviser to the school district's Region A, which includes 
Carson. She said the youngsters prepare for the concert by learning in their 
classrooms about the music that will be played. 
</P>
<P>
From Steiner's perspective as a symphony conductor, the program has a practical 
as well as aesthetic purpose. "If you don't teach kids to be an audience now," 
she said, "there won't be any in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
She said she deliberately chooses music that will appeal to young people, show 
off the orchestra or provide opportunities for narrated stories -- such as 
"Peter and the Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are a pretty good audience, but there are a few noisy ones," said 
Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
Story tellers, mimes or dancers are apt to turn up in a concert to give 
children something other than the orchestra to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Friday, it was the lively college Dance Ensemble performing a set of 
dances from Aaron Copland's "Rodeo" that brought the most comments. 
</P>
<P>
The men in cowboy hats and kerchiefs and the women in full, swirling skirts 
danced out into the audience, thrust their arms toward the children and all but 
stepped on the toes of the kids in the front row as they worked in a small 
space between the musicians and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters laughed, clapped and whistled at the rousing finale, as the men 
raised one of the women on their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it when they picked up that girl," said Candice Davenport, 9, who goes 
to Ambler Avenue School. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Redmon, 10, another Ambler student, said he liked the sound of the 
clarinet best of all the instruments. "The orchestra played very good music," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The same music, together with some other selections, will be played by the 
orchestra in a free concert today at 3 p.m. at the community center. 
</P>
<P>
"If you liked this," Steiner told the departing children, "come back Sunday and 
bring your family." Gerald Faris

CLARK, TERRELL HAVE TROUBLE AGAINST ASTROS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The curveballs that dive in the dirt, the sliders that tail toward the dugout, 
the junk, it's all starting to get to Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth consecutive game Saturday -- every game this season -- the Padre 
first baseman was given nothing honest to hit. So he didn't. He stood by almost 
helplessly as the Astros, with the fine National League debut of pitcher Jim 
Clancy complementing the bad Padre debut of Walt Terrell, defeated the Padres, 
6-2, in front of a paid crowd of 19,427 at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Clark wasn't the reason the Padres lost -- Terrell allowed nine shots 
(officially scored as hits) in just 4 1/3 innings and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark continued what has become a theme in this first week, one in which 
the Padres have won just two of five games. He didn't get a hit. Not only 
didn't he get a hit, he never made contact. He walked twice and struck out 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far in 12 at-bats, he has one hit, seven strikeouts and five walks. That's 
an .083 average. The man who is supposed to be the Padres' most feared hitter 
is a man without a bat. And a man who has lost his patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Two walks and two strikeouts just don't get it," Clark said. "They just aren't 
pitching to me. They aren't giving me anything. Tonight, they get the big lead, 
and there is two out and they are still giving me nothing. I'm thinking, 'I'm 
not that good of a hitter, am I?' I guess they figure they don't want to give 
me anything to get me started. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got make adjustments. Maybe get all over the plate or something. That 
will be a big step, because it goes against what I've forced myself to do to 
accomplish what I've accomplished. But if I got to do it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Clark's voice hardened to a tone one only hears these days in late-night 
Western movies. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these days, sooner or later, somebody is going to pay," Clark said. 
"And when they do, they will pay in a big way." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, agreed everyone from Tony Gwynn to Manager Jack McKeon, is that 
everybody remembers Clark from his days with the St. Louis Cardinals a couple 
of years ago, and everybody is still afraid of him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of obvious, he's been pitched really nasty," Gwynn said. "He's been 
getting a steady diet of curveballs and fastballs that are three inches off the 
plate. They are trying to get him to chase them. He's been around too long to 
chase them. So he walks -- he'll walk 140 times this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what they are thinking, because when we faced Clark we always thought 
the same thing. Do not let him beat you." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I won't alibi for him . . . they've made some pretty good pitches 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
At least one alibi exists, but Clark refuses it. 
</P>
<P>
He has been battling a groin pull suffered in Palm Springs in the last week of 
spring training. But he said Saturday that his groin has nearly healed and 
presents no problems hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is in its tail end; I don't notice it hitting, I just have to be 
careful when I run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the pitching is heightened when one considers that the batter 
hitting behind Clark, Carmelo Martinez, has been even more disappointing that 
Clark. Coming off a six-homer spring, Martinez is one for 15, that one being a 
single. 
</P>
<P>
"But Jack is going to get pitched like that if Carmelo was behind him or not," 
McKeon said. "That's just how teams view him." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning Saturday, when former Toronto veteran Clancy began a good 
run that lasted 8 1/3 innings with just two allowed runs on six hits, Clark 
came up with Gwynn on first and two outs. He struck out looking. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth and sixth innings he walked and never got past second base. He 
came up in the eight with Gwynn again on first base after a single. Again, he 
struck out, this time with a too-hard checked swing. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize I'm going to strike out -- I would rather strike out than go for 
some of those pitches and hit into double plays," said Clark, who didn't help 
himself with a fourth-inning fielding error that led to an Astro run. "They 
fall behind in the count to me but still give me their second- and third-best 
pitches. They know how bad I want to hit it. So I go for it and ending up 
checking my swing and . . . if they force my hand, I'll have to change the way 
I approach things up there, that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
Terrell's struggles didn't make things any better. His outing means that after 
one outing each, the five Padre starters have lasted just 30 2/3 innings -- 
just over six innings per start -- allowing 42 hits and 21 runs for a 6.18 
earned-run average. The two new guys -- Bruce Hurst and Terrell -- have allowed 
19 hits and 11 runs in 9 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell struggled in allowing a run in both the second and fourth innings; then 
the Astros finished him in the fifth with four straight shots: a single by 
Rafael Ramirez, a single by Billy Hatcher, a double by Glenn Davis and an 
two-run double by Bill Doran. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the ball up; I don't know what I was doing, but I just got it up," 
Terrell said. "It was just bad pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I think a couple of the new guys have been maybe trying to 
overachieve, trying too hard. They'll settle down." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst was greeted in the clubhouse before Saturday's game with his own 
special rap song written and recorded on cassette tape by relievers Mark Grant 
and Greg Booker, who call themselves "The Bully Boys" because of their time 
spent in the bullpen. The song joked about, among other things, Hurst's 
abstinence from caffeine and alcohol. It included lines such as "His very first 
outing was the worst of the year . . . he went into the clubhouse and almost 
had a beer." Or "60,000 dollars is one day's pay . . . that's why he lives in 
Rancho Santa Fe." Or "After a game he's happy as can be . . . he reaches for a 
Coke, caffeine free." Booker and Grant recorded the song near the hotel here at 
one of those shopping mall instant-recording studios that have popped up around 
the country. They have been writing the song since the club's trip to Las Vegas 
last week. The Bully Boys' manager, Mark Davis, sprung for the cost of the 
three-minute tape, $18. "We wouldn't have done it if we didn't like Hurst so 
much," Booker said. "How sweet," replied Hurst, who laughed throughout the the 
playing of the song. "I guess I really owe them one." 
</P>
<P>
John Kruk was benched for the third consecutive game Saturday, this time 
because of a sore right shin, one of many small injuries that have been nagging 
him. Manager Jack McKeon had a meeting with Kruk and discussed the possibility 
that the injuries are being caused by his weight (about 210). Kruk agreed and 
said he will try to lose a few pounds. "If I don't, my shin will explode," Kruk 
said. "The thing is to maintain my weight. Not starve myself, Jack said not to 
starve. Just don't eat the bad foods. Like hot dogs. And pizza. And beer." Kruk 
is the only hitless regular, in eight at-bats. . . . Both Luis Salazar and Walt 
Terrell showed up in the Astrodome this weekend in suits. Coincidence? Hardly. 
When both were with Detroit last season, they were required to wear suit 
jackets in public on the road except in Anaheim and Arlington, Tex., in both 
cases because of the heat. "I don't think it's a bad rule, actually," Terrell 
said. "I don't think it's too much to ask that we look professional." . . . 
Mark Grant has a soft spot in his heart -- and wallet -- for the Astrodome. 
More specifically, the visitors' dugout toilet. You see, he owns it. Two 
seasons ago, in a fit of rage after a tough start, Grant took a bat to the 
toilet and demolished it. He said that last year he received a bill for the 
toilet and soap dish and other items that amounted to around $300. "What the 
heck, I thought it would be a lot more than that," he said Friday. "Do you know 
how much porcelain costs these days?" . . . One of the big stories of the 
Astros' spring was the extra work in the batting cage taken by their pitchers. 
Houston Manager Art Howe figured it couldn't hurt. And so it hasn't hurt. Last 
season, with two out and runners in scoring position, Astro pitchers were zero 
for 80. That's right, hitless. This year, in the season opener, with runners on 
second and third and two out, pitcher Mike Scott came up and promptly singled.

BROWN LEADS BY TWO SHOTS AT STONERIDGE

You could read the look of anticipation on Nancy Brown's face. 
</P>
<P>
You could tell she wished that 24 hours had suddenly passed and that she was 
accepting congratulations instead of looking ahead to today's final round of 
the LPGA Tour's Red Robin Kyocera Inamori tournament at StoneRidge. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it is when a pro golfer is this close to a first victory. Brown 
has been on the tour since 1985 without winning, and now she is only 18 holes 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Despite slipping to a one-under-par 70 Saturday, after shooting 69 and 67 in 
the first two rounds, Brown broke away from a tie with Laura Davies and took a 
two-stroke lead with a 54-hole score of 206, seven under par. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll sleep OK tonight," Brown said. "I sure hope so. My biggest 
problem is that I get too worried about making mistakes. I've got to forget 
them and do what's gotten me here." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Rizzo -- who was in a 10th-place tie at the halfway point, four strokes 
behind Brown and Davies -- shot a 68 and climbed into second at 208. Martha 
Nause retained third place but slid from one shot back to three with a 72 for 
209. 
</P>
<P>
Juli Inkster, winner of the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament in Rancho Mirage 
last week, moved into a fourth-place tie along with Penny Hammel and Jane 
Crafter at 210. A shot behind them were Cindy Rarick, Amy Alcott and Amy Benz. 
</P>
<P>
Davies met disaster on the par-five sixth hole in the form of two out-of-bounds 
drives that cost her four strokes in penalties. She wound up with a nine on the 
hole and struggled to a 76 that left her in a 10-way tie for 10th at 212. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit two terrible shots and paid the maximum penalty," Davies said. "I sliced 
the first one and hooked the second. I had three-putted the two holes before 
that, and that probably led up to it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has finished as high as a tie for third, in the 1988 du Maurier 
tournament in Coquitiam, Canada, but so far the big one has eluded her. 
</P>
<P>
"I led once before going into the final round," Brown said. "That was six weeks 
ago in the Kemper Open (in Kauai, Hawaii). It rained most of the week, and they 
cut the tournament to three rounds. I shot a 77 the last day and fell way out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
She fell so far that she wound up in a tie for 14th. Her best finish this year 
has been a tie for eighth in the Oldsmobile in Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I'll profit from what happened in Hawaii," she said. "I certainly 
hope it's going to be different tomorrow. I'm happy with my attitude, and I'm 
putting much better. I'm more aggressive now." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that the slow greens at StoneRidge have worked to her advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"For three weeks in a row, I hadn't made any putts," she said. "I'd been too 
tentative on the greens. On these greens, I've been a lot more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Brown putted so well Saturday that she drew praise from Davies, who played in 
the last threesome with her and Nause. 
</P>
<P>
"Every putt she hit, she had a chance," Davies said. "She was outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "It's nice to hear that from as good a player as Laura is. Her 
attitude is unbelievable. She didn't even let that trouble she had get her 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I could learn so much from her attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had four birdies and three bogeys, averting a fourth with a superb shot 
out of a bunker behind the 18th green. It landed just a foot from the hole, and 
she finished with a par. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of my best shots of the day," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown expressed surprise that no golfer made a run at her on a day the 
temperature finally fell short of 100. Still, Rizzo, an eighth-year tour 
veteran from Miami, picked up enough ground to put herself into contention. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got a little more experience tomorrow (than Brown)," said Rizzo, 
who has won three tournaments and $605,596 in her career. "I'm going to have to 
shoot a couple under par tomorrow and pray. Nancy is a good player, a long 
hitter, but I'm playing well now, and I'm playing with confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzo's 68 included four birdies and a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"I bogeyed No. 13," she said. "I hit my tee shot into a tree and had to punch 
it out." 
</P>
<P>
Nause, from Sheboygan, Wis., has won once in 11-plus seasons on the tour. She 
was even with Brown after four holes, but after shooting 11 consecutive pars -- 
she had 12 in a row Friday -- she bogeyed two of the last four holes. She 
missed a two-foot putt on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind made it a guessing game out there," Nause said. "Some holes played a 
lot different from other days. My iron shots weren't good at all, so I'm happy 
to be where I am." 
</P>
<P>
The ever-positive Davies, who is from West Byfleet, England, said her 
horrendous experience of Saturday hadn't destroyed her hopes of winning the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only six shots behind, so I'm still in the hunt," she said. "Maybe I have 
to shoot 64 to win, maybe I don't." 
</P>
<P>
LPGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Rittenhouse shot the second hole-in-one of the tournament Saturday, 
sinking her drive with a six-iron on the 153-yard seventh hole. She went to 
shoot a 29, the best nine-hole round of the tournament, but followed with a 39. 
Sue Thomas had shot a hole-in-one Friday before missing the cut. . . . Cindy 
Mackey's 66 was the tournament's best 18-hole round and moved her within six 
strokes of the lead at 212. . . . Cindy Rarick, Dale Eggeling and Sue Tonkin, 
who had been only two shots back after 36 holes, slipped back into the pack 
with rounds of 73, 74 and 76. Rarick was so upset with herself at the halfway 
point that she slammed her ball into the water off the ninth green. . . . The 
three surviving San Diego County golfers also had tough days. Kathryn Young of 
Coronado shot a 74 (219), Deedee Lasker of Rancho Santa Fe a 75 (217) and Meg 
Mallon of Ramona a 76 (223).

Erik Rasmussen scored the game-winner 8:04 into overtime Saturday as the 
Wichita Wings defeated the Sockers, 6-5, in a Major Indoor Soccer League game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, coupled with the Dallas Sidekicks' 6-2 victory over the MISL-leading 
Baltimore Blast, left the Sockers stuck in two ways. It prevented them from 
clinching second place in the regular-season race and also from making up 
ground on the Blast. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore leads the league with a 27-18 record with three games to play. The 
Sockers, who are assured one of five playoff berths, are 25-20, also with three 
games remaining, while Dallas is 22-22 with four games left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Wichita in the playoff hunt with a 21-24 record, good for 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers lost a game of streaks before 9,037. Both teams had runs of three 
consecutive goals to take short-lived leads. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers rallied from a 4-2 halftime deficit on second-half goals by Allen 
Willey, Paul Wright and Waad Hirmez to go in front, 5-4, with 8:30 remaining. 
But Dale Ervine then scored his second goal of the game for Wichita with 4:18 
left to force overtime, and Rasmussen followed with a blast from 30 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
With newly acquired Otto Orf II starting in goal, the Sockers took first-half 
leads of 1-0 (on a goal by Steve Zungul) and 2-1 (Kevin Crow with 12:33 left in 
the half). The Wings then rallied for a 4-2 lead on goals by Chico Borja, 
Ervine and Mike Stankovic, his second of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Orf finished with 14 saves starting in relief of Victor Nogueira. Cris Vacarro 
had 15 for Wichita.

BURNHAM FINALLY OVERTAKES MILLER, WINS 200 AT ARCADIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After suffering her second defeat of the season to Inger Miller of Muir High in 
the 100 meters earlier, Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa was hardly brimming with 
confidence as she crouched in the starting blocks for the 200 at the Arcadia 
Invitational track meet at Arcadia High on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that the 200 would be my bad race if I ran one," said Burnham, the 
defending state champion in the 100 and 200. "I wasn't really sure how well I'd 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Any doubts Burnham harbored evaporated quickly as the Spartan senior -- 
trailing Miller entering the homestretch -- gunned down her rival in the final 
40 meters to win in 23.63 seconds, the second-fastest high school time in the 
nation this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told myself to relax and go after her coming off the turn," Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham had run the second-fastest time in the nation in the 100 (11.64), but 
Miller had run the fastest (11.59) by pulling away in the last 20 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Now a winner of three consecutive Arcadia 200s, Burnham also turned in superb 
performances in the relays, anchoring the Spartans to third in the invitational 
400 relay (47.77) and second in the seeded 1,600 relay (3 minutes, 56.62 
seconds) with a 55.9 anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lewis of Burbank and Bryan Dameworth of Agoura also ran strong last laps 
to win the boys' 1,600 and 3,200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis timed 61.5 over the final 400 to win the 1,500 in 4:11.20 and Dameworth 
ran a 64.3 last lap to win the 3,200 in 9:03.62. 
</P>
<P>
The times were personal bests for each runner, and coincidentally, both Lewis 
and Dameworth set their previous bests at last year's Arcadia meet, when Lewis 
placed fourth in the 1,600 in 4:14.5 and Dameworth finished seventh in the 
3,200 in 9:06.46. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' victory came against a stellar field that included Coley Candaele of 
Carpinteria and Francis O'Neill of San Pasqual St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to win this race and run a good time," said Lewis, who will 
attend Stanford. "But I knew there were a lot of really good guys in the race." 
</P>
<P>
Content to run in the middle of the pack for the first 800 (2:06.7), Lewis 
moved into second at 1,200 meters (3:09.4) and surged past leader Mike 
Williamson of Thousand Oaks with 350 meters remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided to make my move right then," Lewis said. "I figured there was 
no reason to wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis caught the field by surprise as he opened a seven-meter lead with 200 to 
go and then repelled the homestretch charges of Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle 
(4:11.94) and Arroyo Grande's Luis Quintana (4:12.24). 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill finished fourth in 4:12.89 and Candaele placed seventh in 4:15.07. 
Williamson faded to eighth, but still ran a personal best of 4:15.65. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dameworth's time was short of his pre-meet goal of 8:57, the Agoura 
junior could take pride in that it was a national outdoor leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone just pulled in behind me at the start," Dameworth said. "So I knew 
right then that if I wanted to run fast, I was going to have to lead." 
</P>
<P>
After running the opening 1,600 in 4:31.4, Dameworth and Wilson sophomore 
Martin Morales broke away from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Morales hung at Dameworth's shoulder until the bell lap, when the two-time 
defending state Division I cross-country champion surged away. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Crissy Mills of Campbell Hall won the girls' high jump at 5 
feet, 8 inches, and Tony Borquez of Alemany placed third in the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Borquez ran a personal best of 47.96 as Albert Ransom of Denver Montbello won 
with a nation-leading 46.57. Borquez also won the seeded 200 in 22.03.

TEAM STRUGGLES AS AILING COACH MONITORS SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A victory by the Cleveland baseball team would serve as a spoonful of sugar for 
Coach Ray Todd. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland skipper, meanwhile, has had a tough time swallowing his medicine 
in the intensive care unit of Westlake Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Todd, who has been unavailable for comment, was hospitalized March 22 after 
experiencing heart palpitations moments after Cleveland's North Valley League 
game against San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
According to his wife, Janet, the 55-year-old Todd, who battled back from 
bypass surgery three years ago, will be released sometime next week. Last week, 
doctors implanted an automatic defibrillator to help maintain a consistent 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's all uphill now," Janet Todd said. "It's just a matter of getting 
his strength back. He's had problems in the past, but he's always come 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Todd anxiously awaits postgame reports, which have not been too 
favorable. Cleveland, which had two wins and a tie in its first three games, is 
1-5 under interim coaches Marty Siegel and Tom Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty usually will call him and tell him how the game went," Janet Todd said. 
"One time he said, 'They didn't call me, so they must have lost.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, Todd's illness has united the Cavaliers, Smith said. "They 
tend to coach each other," he said. "They all want to see him back. I just try 
to teach what Coach Todd wants -- hustle, hustle, hustle." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's only victory in Todd's absence is an 8-2 win over Canoga Park that 
earned a split of last week's two-game series. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were a little bit lost at first," Siegel said. "They had no idea this 
was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said senior third baseman Tony Holiday: "It was harder for me than for some of 
the other guys because I'm so close to Coach Todd. I didn't expect to make 
varsity as a 10th-grader, but he made the decision flat out: I was going to 
play my 10th-grade year." 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made on whether Todd will return as coach this year, Janet 
Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he would like to," she said. "But I really don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
Said Holiday: "Everybody hopes he'll come back and re-take the team. But the 
thing right now is, we want him to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Double pump: Jim Brink considered it a big win. How big? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching here 11 years," Brink said, "and that's gotta be one of the 
biggest wins of our program." 
</P>
<P>
Brink was referring to Harvard's dramatic, 5-4, victory in eight innings over 
Arcadia, a Pacific League power and owner of a 12-3 record entering Friday's 
nonleague game at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Jacobsen, who pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the first 
inning, and Guy Starkman teamed to stop the Apaches on five hits. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, with two out and the bases loaded, Jay Borenstein fouled off 
several full-count pitches before stroking a single down the right-field line 
to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
"After that," Brink said, "there was a big flesh pile in the infield." 
</P>
<P>
What made Harvard's feat in the heat even more impressive, however, was that 
earlier in the day, Harvard hammered Buckley, 15-2. 
</P>
<P>
That's a combined 20 runs on 27 hits in 100-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
No time out for Holly: What would a Harvard fall -- or winter -- or spring be 
without the play of senior Marty Holly? 
</P>
<P>
Holly, the Saracens' All-San Fernando Valley League tailback, all-league 
midfielder for the soccer team, tenacious leader of the school's rugby squad 
and all-around sweaty guy, goes by another title in the spring -- all-league 
center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Holly, a first-team selection each of the past two years, is batting .300 this 
season and was a combined four for six including a home run Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to skip around from season to season," said Holly, who will play 
football at California in the fall. "I think if I didn't have something to 
occupy my time with, I'd probably be a bum. I'd probably fall apart. It's like 
I need sports to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Holly, by golly, even puts in ice time for the school's hockey team. "It's not 
really a team, though," Holly said. "It's a club. But I make the scheduled 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Simi switches: Rich Langford, Simi Valley's undefeated right-hander, is 
day-to-day after hyper-extending his right shoulder March 29 in a 3-2 victory 
over Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Langford, 5-0 with a 0.45 earned-run average, has not pitched since but is 
tentatively scheduled to start Friday against Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
If Langford is unable to pitch, junior Kenny Hood will replace Mike Jenkins on 
Wednesday against Channel Islands and Jenkins will fill in against Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Glad to be here: "Right now we feel like we can beat anybody," Thousand Oaks 
Coach Jim Hansen said. "That is not to be so bold as to say we're going to win 
the league title." 
</P>
<P>
And that's not to say the Lancers could beat the Lancer alumni, which clobbered 
Hansen's team, "about 22-3," this season, according to Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
That is to say that Hansen and Co. (3-1) are happy to be locked in a three-way 
tie for second with Camarillo and Simi Valley in the Marmonte League, 
considering "no real solid team leadership or no one taking that role on the 
team," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
And considering this season's misadventures. 
</P>
<P>
A nonleague game with Culver City was canceled when Culver City's bus driver 
became sick two hours before game time. Then a nonleague game with Long Beach 
Poly during Easter week was canceled when several Poly players left for 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Short on opponents and long on idle time, Hansen scheduled the alumni game. Bad 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty low," he said. "The kids were down, but they were more 
awe-struck by the alumni's talent. 
</P>
<P>
"But the main thing is, we've become a team."

KENNEDY STREAK ENDS AT 8 AS HENSON PITCHES MONROE TO 3-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior left-hander Sean Henson pitched an eight-hitter, allowed one earned run 
and struck out six as Monroe High defeated Kennedy, 3-2, in a second-round game 
in the championship bracket of the Holt-Goodman baseball tournament Saturday at 
Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Henson (2-2) walked one batter and escaped a jam in the ninth with a little 
luck. With Monroe leading, 3-1, Kennedy's Garret Anderson led off the seventh 
with a double. Kennedy's Gino Tagliaferri then drilled a line drive to center 
for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
"He smoked one," Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell said. "He crushed it, but right at 
the center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Henson then retired Travis Bourne on a ground ball before Pat DeBoer singled 
home Anderson. Danny Gugler, who earlier had doubled, flied out to left to end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The win snapped an eight-game winning streak by Kennedy (12-3). 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the fifth and men on second and third, Monroe's Tim Costic -- 
the 1988 City Section Player of the Year -- singled in the eventual 
game-winning runs. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Lawrence had two hits for Monroe (8-2), which will play Chatsworth in a

CANYONS' WOES CONTINUE IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even when College of the Canyons was firmly entrenched atop the Western State 
Conference baseball standings, Coach Len Mohney did not have an abundance of 
confidence in his pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
And now that the Cougars are struggling to keep pace with Ventura, Valley and 
Moorpark, Mohney is downright fearful. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a scary situation every time we send a pitcher out there," Mohney 
said. "We don't have a stopper on this team. Maybe that's why we can't win any 
of the big games." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching is not Mohney's only concern, however. Fielding is also a problem for 
the Cougars, who committed seven errors in a 9-3 WSC loss to host Ventura on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not put one game together all year where we have pitched, played 
defense and hit," Mohney said. 
</P>
<P>
To compound the Cougars' problems, their last two losses have come against two 
of the top teams in the WSC -- Valley and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not won a big game all year," Mohney said. "The only reason we are 
close is because we haven't lost to the bottom teams in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (15-13, 8-4 in WSC play) has lost twice to Ventura to fall a game off 
the league lead and will face another contender when it travels to Moorpark on 
Thursday. Ventura (21-8, 9-3) has won two games in a row and five of its last 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Mental mistakes and throwing errors cost Canyons on Saturday. The Cougars also 
made a costly baserunning error in the seventh inning when Adam Grant was 
picked off second base by Ventura catcher Tom Couture with two men on and none 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Espitia, pitching in relief of Dean McMillin, then walked Randy Cooper 
and Gary Morgan to load the bases. After Chris Joy struck out, the Cougars 
scored a run on a passed ball before Ernie Perez grounded out to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big mental breakdown for us to get picked off and a real killer to 
only get one run in that inning," Mohney said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, leading 4-3 after thwarting the Cougars in the seventh, rallied for 
three runs on two hits and two Cougar errors in the home half of the inning and 
added two more runs in the eighth to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons touched McMillin for two runs in the first on Cooper's home run over 
the left-field fence. McMillin, a freshman left-hander, allowed nine hits in 
six innings. But Canyons repeatedly failed to get a clutch hit with runners in 
scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura tied the score, 2-2, in the bottom of the first, turning a hit and 
three Cougar throwing errors into a pair of runs. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura added two in the fourth to take a 4-2 lead. Chris Ames singled to score 
Brent Cookson, who had walked and advanced to second on Joel Gaxiola's 
sacrifice. Darrel McMillin walked, advanced to third on Ames' single and scored 
on David Eggert's ground out. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Teich (1-1) took the loss and McMillin (7-3) was the winner.

ANALYZING PSYCHIATRISTS' KIDS; 
</P>
<P>
IN A NEW BOOK, SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ANALYSTS SOUND OFF ON THE PERILS OF LIFE 
WITH FREUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JAPENGA, Japenga is a free-lance writer living in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Maeder's childhood was ruled by the minute hand. Between 10 minutes of 
the hour and the hour, he could not leave his room to go downstairs because 
that was when his parents' patients came and went. 
</P>
<P>
Children of psychiatrists, like Maeder, often live in terror of violating 
taboos surrounding their parents' in-home offices. One child has described her 
analyst mother's office as "very much a sacred place, like a chapel." 
</P>
<P>
But now, in Maeder's new book, "Children of Psychiatrists and Other 
Psychotherapists" (Harper and Row), psychiatrists' kids finally get the chance 
to symbolically storm these formerly off-limits sanctuaries. 
</P>
<P>
Maeder invited 200 children of mental-health professionals to make themselves 
at home on Dad's analytic couch, to flip through the pages of Mom's books by 
that guy named "Frood," and -- ultimately -- to tell the world what was going 
on up in the children's wing while the folks were sequestered in a sound-proof 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Maeder's subjects claim they suffered an assortment of childhood miseries 
related to their parents' profession. Many report feeling over-analyzed, 
emotionally invaded and intimidated by their parents' perceived omniscience. 
They are confused by their parents' patients, the strangers who seem to want to 
possess the mother or father that children think belong only to them. 
</P>
<P>
High on their list of grievances also is the pressure these children felt to 
appear emotionally healthy at all times. "Psychiatrists' kids are not supposed 
to be a mess," said one woman who was interviewed for the book. "I was 
constantly being told I was a very happy child." 
</P>
<P>
Although the book has angered some in the psychiatric community, at least some 
of the adults Maeder interviewed are grateful to him for giving them a chance 
to compare notes with other children of psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think it was just the nature of childhood that parents had this 
certain kind of authority in defining reality," said a Bay Area artist who 
asked not to be named out of deference to her psychiatrist parents who are 
still practicing. "I'm glad he (Maeder) brought this up. I think it's a service 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Little of Mill Valley, Calif., said: "It was very helpful to me to see 
there were other people in the world who had experienced problems of a similar 
nature." His father, now dead, was a Hollywood psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Myth About Psychiatrists' Kids 
</P>
<P>
According to Maeder, there has been little written until now on the particular 
problems of psychiatrists' children, although Maeder found that nearly everyone 
he interviewed could cite the folk belief that psychiatrists' kids are crazy. 
(When asked why this myth exists, 47% of Maeder's subjects said it was because 
there was some factual basis to the assumption.) 
</P>
<P>
Maeder, who lives with his wife and three children in Narberth, Penn., is the 
son of a psychiatric social worker and a psychoanalyst. He started work on his 
book, he said, because he thought it ironic that a segment of society that many 
would consider best-equipped for child-rearing might actually be making a mess 
of the job. 
</P>
<P>
Maeder, 37, set out to find subjects for his study by contacting presidents of 
regional psychiatric associations. Many of his subjects came to him by more 
informal means; a friend, for example, scanned wedding announcements in the New 
York Times for brides and bridegrooms who claimed a psychiatrist parent. 
</P>
<P>
Other than a brief reference to his own parents in the introduction, Maeder 
leaves himself out of book. "I didn't really feel like talking about myself 
that much," he said in a telephone interview. That his parents are deceased 
probably made it easier for him to write the book without feeling he was 
betraying them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That response was shared by many of his subjects, who were willing to bare 
their own psyches but were protective of their parents' privacy. Most of the 
anecdotes in the book are anonymous, Maeder said, for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
A believer in the "wounded healer" concept, Maeder says the shortcomings of 
psychiatrist parents have much to do with the kind of people who take up the 
profession in the first place. Thus, he writes: "The bad effects of therapist 
parents are predominantly the result of flaws that afflict them as people 
rather than by-products of their training." 
</P>
<P>
One critic of Maeder's views, Dr. Harvey Ruben, public affairs chairman of the 
American Psychiatric Assn. in Washington, finds the "wounded healer" stereotype 
offensive and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"At best, Maeder's book is irrelevant and at worst it's damaging," said Ruben, 
an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University and the father 
of three children. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from a small, self-selected sample, Ruben said, Maeder makes 
generalizations about 220,000 or more mental-health professionals nationwide, 
condemning them in their roles as professionals and as parents. 
</P>
<P>
"He's saying, 'If your parents are helpers, they're probably scarred,' " Ruben 
said, adding that Maeder's conclusions are "skewed and lopsided." 
</P>
<P>
Maeder himself uses the word lopsided to describe his book because, he said, he 
was most interested in looking at the negative influences of psychiatrist 
parents on their children. As he puts it in the book's introduction, "By 
observing how things can go wrong, we are better equipped to perceive how they 
might go right." 
</P>
<P>
"I do not claim that most therapists harm their children more than other people 
do, nor that therapists mostly do harm to their children," he writes. "Most 
therapists, most of the time, act like anyone else, for better or worse." 
</P>
<P>
But Ruben worries that, in reinforcing the commonly held belief that 
psychiatrists are emotionally unbalanced, Maeder's book could dissuade troubled 
people from seeking treatment. 
</P>
<P>
It does seem that an anti-psychiatry bias exists in many of Maeder's subjects. 
For instance, one son of a psychiatrist concludes, "Psychiatry is probably 
nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Author Is Surprised 
</P>
<P>
The author appears hurt and surprised by the critical reaction to his book. "I 
didn't set out to trash psychotherapists, despite what many of them seem to 
think now," said Maeder, who has written three previous nonfiction books, 
including a history of the insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
Maeder said the first question everyone wants to ask of a psychiatrist's child 
is: Did your parents analyze you? 
</P>
<P>
Many of Maeder's subjects answer "Yes." They noted that the very language that 
shaped daily interaction in their households tended to be analytical; one 
subject remarked on the number of times the word hostile crept into ordinary 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area artist said, "If I dropped my fork at dinner, my parents said: 
'What's going on? What are you angry at?' when I may have just dropped my 
fork." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the parents of his subjects often analyze their children, Maeder 
found, but they fairly routinely subjected them to the analysis of others at an 
early age. So entrenched is the expectation that all children go to therapy 
that one psychiatrist's daughter said when she got married one of her first 
thoughts was: "Now I have to start saving for my kids' analysis." 
</P>
<P>
But Maeder said, "I got a lot of complaints from people who thought they had 
been made much worse by being sent to therapy as children." 
</P>
<P>
Being rushed to therapy prematurely can "magnify small problems," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Little, for example, said that his parents, when he was a child, chose to send 
him to a a psychiatrist; what he says he really needed, in retrospect, was help 
with his homework. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the complaints mentioned in the book are by no means exclusive to 
therapists' children, Maeder said. Psychiatrists are not the only parents who 
want to give people the impression their kids are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychiatrists are just a little more invested in that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Maeder's subjects describe a power imbalance that exists to a degree 
in almost any parent-child relationship. But the situation is exacerbated, 
Maeder said, when the parent belongs to an "implied priest class" believed to 
possess rare and mysterious powers. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists come to parenting with an arsenal of intellectual theories and 
jargon that can be used to silence children who are just beginning to trust 
their own instincts. One man told Maeder that when he or his siblings rebelled, 
"We got hit with a Freudian whip." 
</P>
<P>
Children of psychiatrists reported that the infliction of psychoanalytic 
punishment made them feel stripped of any privacy. "I was very scared by the 
idea that (my mother) could know me better than I know myself," said a 
psychoanalyst's daughter, who added that she is now "determined that nobody 
know me better than myself." 
</P>
<P>
Maeder's book does not advise young psychiatrists on ways to avoid making 
mistakes common to psychiatrist parents. Yet the subjects of the book hope his 
work will be the first step in improving the lot of "PsyKs" as Maeder calls 
psychiatrists' children, a variation of the abbreviation for preachers' kids, 
sometimes referred to as PKs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the bleak picture painted by his book, Maeder said psychiatrists' 
children are really not so bad off when the full range of childhood trauma is 
considered. "They're not sick. They just have certain problems," he said. "But 
they're actually pretty privileged. Their problems are sort of ethereal 
compared to some." 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to being a psychiatrist's child is that they almost uniformly 
feel they have been raised in a more enlightened, stimulating environment than 
that of their peers. Maeder's subjects suffered no shortage of museum visits, 
piano lessons or fascinating tales of strangers' troubles at the dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of those Maeder interviewed went into the arts; another third 
into mental health professions. The artist from the Bay Area said in a 
telephone interview that she vacillated between both professions, but settled 
on art. She said it allows her the "spontaneity of expression" she was denied 
as a child.

<P>
THE BUDGET CHRONICLES AMISH LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SUGARCREEK, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Budget, a nationally circulated weekly newspaper published for 99 years in 
this tiny Ohio hamlet, has more than 500 reporters -- more contributing writers 
than most, if not all, of the nation's largest dailies. 
</P>
<P>
The Budget is not your run-of-the-mill country weekly. Its scribes, as the 
newspaper's reporters are called, and its 18,000 subscribers are throwbacks to 
the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
They live in the past. They are farmers. They use horses to plow their fields, 
a horse and buggy for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
They're self-sufficient, erecting their own homes and barns, growing their own 
livestock and crops. They get along without automobiles, electricity, 
telephones, radios and television. They still use wood cook stoves, iceboxes 
and outhouses. Kerosene lanterns are their source of light. 
</P>
<P>
Readers of the Budget, which doesn't have headlines or photographs, wear 
old-fashioned clothing made in their homes. Their shirts, trousers and 
granny-style, ankle-length dresses have no zippers or buttons. Hooks and eyes 
are used instead. Women and girls wear bonnets. 
</P>
<P>
The Budget subscribers are Amish, an estimated 100,000 closely knit, religious 
people whose simple way of life is a living museum of the past. The Amish are 
scattered across the United States in tiny settlements from Montana to Florida, 
from Texas to Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1890, the Budget has been the sole communication link among Amish 
settlements throughout the country. Each Amish community has a scribe who files 
weekly or biweekly reports to the paper on the weather, births, weddings, 
deaths, accidents, illnesses, buggy wrecks, sightings of the first robin in 
spring, funny and odd happenings. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from different communities -- at least 325 are published each issue -- 
are like letters from home. It's the way the Amish keep in touch with relatives 
and friends all over America and find out what's happening in the far-flung 
settlements of the plain people. 
</P>
<P>
Scribes file their copy in longhand on sheets of lined paper or any scrap paper 
such as backs of calendar pages or backs of children's homework. They mail the 
latest news from their community to the Budget's office here in east-central 
Ohio, 100 miles south of Cleveland, in the heart of Ohio's Amish country. 
Sugarcreek has the largest concentration of Amish in the United States, with 
nearly 20,000 living in Holmes, Wayne, Coshoctan and Tuscarawas counties -- 
more Amish than in Pennsylvania's Lancaster County. 
</P>
<P>
The Budget doesn't print news about local, state, national or international 
events or issues. The Amish aren't interested in what happens outside their own 
communities; they have turned their back on the outside world. They don't read 
daily newspapers, listen to the radio or watch television. 
</P>
<P>
Crime stories are virtually non-existent because crime seldom occurs in Amish 
settlements. Stories about politicians never appear in this newspaper. Amish 
don't vote. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent samples of the coverage found throughout this quaint 20- to 24-page 
newspaper of the plain people: 
</P>
<P>
Scribe Ida Kinsinger reports from Meyersdale, Pa.: "Katie Yoder's cough seems 
to be letting up. They put a rag in hot vinegar and applying that on the chest, 
then a flannel over it and then a plastic on top of that to hold in the heat. 
The first night they had that on she rested better." 
</P>
<P>
At the Farmerstown, Ohio, Meathouse: "The stuffer we used to stuff the bologna 
broke. The lid popped up and we had 90 pounds of bologna mix all over the 
ceiling and all over the walls. One worker had meat in the face and ears and up 
the nose." 
</P>
<P>
The big news from Cynthiana, Ky.: The Mullets "butchered a huge sow. She 
weighed over 700 pounds. The lard was 3 inches thick on her back. She was fed 
day-old baked goods." 
</P>
<P>
In Swanton, Md., Lydia Mae Kauffman had a bad case of pinkeye. At Withee, Wis., 
"The chicken pox is visiting the children of the different homes." At 
Limpytown, Ohio, "An albino red-tailed hawk was spotted." At Altamont, Tenn., 
"We feel extra busy the last three weeks since the flu found us. Seems like 
there's always a nose to wipe or a dose of one thing or another to give to 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
And, at Fredericksburg, Ohio, "The church was well attended yesterday but 
minister Loyd A. Yoder was not present due to a sore thumb. A knife hit him on 
the thumb while working at home in the shop skinning it to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
The scribes are volunteers. They receive no compensation other than a free 
subscription to the paper and stamped envelopes to send in their reports. A 
subscription to the Budget costs $21 a year. It is a distinctive honor for an 
Amish to be a scribe for the Budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We print the reports from our correspondents pretty much the way they write 
them -- which often is in fractured English, but that's the charm of it," said 
82-year-old George R. Smith, associate editor of the weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the Amish speak Pennsylvania Dutch in their homes and at church. 
English is a second language with them. Their education ends at eighth grade 
because they don't want to learn too much about the world. They live the simple 
life on the farm." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has worked for the Budget 69 years, since he was 13, when his father, 
Samuel Allan Smith, bought the paper in 1920. S. A. Smith was owner-publisher 
until 1936 when he quit to become postmaster of Sugarcreek. George Smith 
succeeded his father as publisher until he sold the paper in 1974 but he has 
stayed on to supervise the scribes, to edit and lay out the paper. 
</P>
<P>
There are different groups of Amish such as the Old Order, the New Order, 
Swartzentruber Amish, Beachy Amish, Nebraska Amish. The Budget covers all 
groups as America's Amish paper. 
</P>
<P>
The Budget's plant is not in keeping with the traditional Amish ways. It is a 
modern print shop. George Smith, a Lutheran, and the 11 others who put the 
paper out are not Amish. That has been the case since the newspaper was first 
published in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
Smith probably knows more Amish than any other living person. He and his wife 
of 54 years, Julia, each year make trips to Amish communities throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years I've seen some gradual changes in the people," Smith notes. 
"They would never ride in a car, for example. Today, there are a number of 
non-Amish men and women who make a living hauling Amish in cars and vans to 
visit relatives, to attend weddings and funerals in other states. 
</P>
<P>
"Another development is the creation of new communities in states where there 
had not been Amish in the past, in places like Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, Texas. The Amish population doubles every 20 years and there is 
always a need for young people to find new land so they move out from the 
traditional settlements." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the Amish, almost to the person, are totally honest, passive, not 
aggressive. "Scoundrels among them are extremely rare. I have tremendous 
respect and admiration for them and for their life style." 
</P>
<P>
As it has for nearly a century, the Budget continues to this day to bind the 
plain people together.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: 300ZX: THE SHAPE OF THINGS NISSAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Followers of interpretive form believe this car could stand alone beneath any 
design center spotlight with its best mood set by the cry of a shakuhachi 
flute. They speak a beholder's beauty of French curves, a shape that is part 
mako shark with a glimpse of Bugatti's flair for increasing the radii of window 
arches . . . and the whole sculpted to the dictates of onrushing wind. 
</P>
<P>
Those heavier of foot than thought have considered performance before poise and 
yearned for long-ago weekends at airfield race tracks. They see the 1990 Nissan 
300ZX as a street sports car that would have sucked the tape off the headlights 
of production Corvettes and Cobras. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the ultraists. 
</P>
<P>
Between their extremes, the 300ZX should appeal only to motorists interested in 
the most eye-catching, hair-straightening, curve-loving, systems-balanced 
sports car since the first Porsche 911 and the next Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
It also is the car that will silence snores for those earlier, porkier 300ZXs 
that inherited only the numerology of the line, never the nimble flair set by 
the Datsun (as Nissan then was) 240Z. 
</P>
<P>
That was 20 years and 1 million Zs ago. The 240Z was both breakthrough and an 
anomaly: a sports car that was not a drafty, noisy, lumbar paralyzer. The 260Z 
was its 1974 refinement into headier horsepower and it too became a star of 
road, track and Kelley Blue Book. 
</P>
<P>
Then the 280ZX arrived four years later -- and with it a gradual descent into 
2x2 configurations, luxury car digitals, a suspension by Winchell Donut and 
shriveling of the performance-handling gene into the 1984 300ZX. It was a 
sports car only to those who consider mud wrestlers to be athletes. It was a 
two-place Lincoln Continental. As Phil Berg noted in AutoWeek: "It is the car 
you get stuck with after you lose the Porsche in a divorce settlement." 
</P>
<P>
At Nissan, fortunately, the bowdlerizing of the Z did not escape notice. A 
better attention-grabber was a 65% slump in 1984-88 Z sales. So a decision was 
made, an edict came down and a three-year ideal formed among company engineers: 
To recraft the 300ZX into the world's best sports car. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to upscale Porsches and any level of Ferrari, that end has not been 
attained. But the 300ZX is going to kill Lotus, Alfa-Romeo, Mazda and the 
Chevrolet Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to any other Formula Freeway vehicle costing $27,500, Nissan is indeed 
the world's best two-seater and an exemplar that could stand until Rolls-Royce 
starts offering cash rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Visually, the 300ZX clearly is a creature of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
If, this way, it looks like a shadow of something else, and, that way, it shows 
a piece of another, it's because there's a limit to the optimums obtained from 
wind tunnels and supercomputers these days. Or how many times can you design 
the egg? 
</P>
<P>
Yet remarkable, even for today, is that the car has been whelped with no 
stick-ons to break the slippery silhouette. No rear deck airfoil. No fender 
flares. No scoops to suck air nor spoilers to rearrange it because some stylist 
argued with an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
And may St. Bertone bless the man who gave the 300ZX flush headlights instead 
of pop-ups best suited to gargoyles and bullfrogs. 
</P>
<P>
Here, simply, are the flawless lines of a tight, single unit; a perfect shell 
built by a team in absolute agreement that the shape must enhance and maximize 
the workings beneath. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expressed Admiration 
</P>
<P>
The penultimate appreciation: On the northbound Harbor Freeway, a Mercedes 
500SEL with two white-shirted CEO-types inside waddled alongside our review 
300ZX of rich Dubonnet maroon. They expressed their admiration for the car by 
acting like office boys -- mouthing awrights and pumping thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate accolade: Downtown, at a stoplight at 6th and Hill streets, a trio 
of Japanese tourists fell over the curb, JAL tote bags and their own feet. They 
wanted to fly home with snapshots of this car, their car that has yet to go on 
sale in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But once this adulation is done, once exposure has softened the radical to 
normal and there are 17,000 300ZXs on the streets of Los Angeles, what then for 
buyers of this car? 
</P>
<P>
They will continue to impress and be impressed by a sports car that is 
engineered to go fast and to behave impeccably while doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Credit at least a little of this to whatever Nissan traditionalist (probably 
the same individual who doesn't like Barney Google headlights) who remembered 
what many manufacturers would have us forget -- that an old-fashioned, 
longitudinally mounted engine up front, with prehistoric rear wheel drive is a 
motoring basic. Put another way: If God had wanted us to have front-wheel 
drive, he would have put our feet on backward. 
</P>
<P>
The engine in the 300ZX is what has become a given of today's performance 
machine, a 24-valve V6 producing 222 spunky horsepower. Disc brakes, of course. 
An anti-lock brake system, naturally. And some industrial strength wheels and 
tires; low profile, speed-rated Michelins on 16-inch wheels that look like they 
were liberated from the Porsche 959 super car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
String of Innovations 
</P>
<P>
The soul of this machine, however, is its chassis and a string of innovations 
that, once proven by time and thrashings of the customers, could be bolted on 
everything but Greyhound buses by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The 300ZX -- shorter than its predecessor, but with a longer wheelbase for less 
overhang -- sits on a four-wheel, independent, multilink suspension system. 
Translation: it disciplines the wheels; taming those braking, steering and 
acceleration forces that cause wheels to change their geometry, thus reducing 
optimum adhesion and control. 
</P>
<P>
It has speed-sensitive power steering. Translation: The slower the speed, the 
lighter the steering, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Power (through a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual) is managed 
through a viscous, limited slip differential. Translation: The system "reads" 
the surface of the road, automatically apportioning power to the rear wheel 
with the better bite. 
</P>
<P>
Magazine praise for the 300ZX -- from London-based Car to Newport Beach-based 
Road &amp; Track -- has been gushing. 
</P>
<P>
But some serious gaffes have been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the 300ZX is an out-and-out, gird-your-gears, no-daughter-of-mine-type 
sports car. But its wizened trunk space won't handle much more than a tennis 
bag, a two-suiter and a pre-shrunk Chihuahua. 
</P>
<P>
Don't plan on removing the T-top unless you live in a humorless neighborhood. 
It ruptures the design line. It makes the 300ZX look like a Boeing 737 with a 
decompression hole in its roof. It also explains why Nissan's publicity stills 
do not show the car topless. 
</P>
<P>
Dedication to the purity of design -- and the creation of an internal pillar to 
handle mounting of shoulder straps -- has created another problem: enormous 
port and starboard blind spots. 
</P>
<P>
And, incredibly, there is no catch to break the seat-backs forward for those of 
us who like to store our videotapes in the seat well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quite Acceptable 
</P>
<P>
Yet the best of this car is so rich that the worst of it is quite acceptable. 
One look at the car's interior -- twin pods to snuggle driver and rider, 
controls clustered beneath all fingertips, everything else easy to reach -- 
should do it. One ride will make the 300ZX essential to your psyche. 
</P>
<P>
The car starts with a grumble and a growl proving its four exhaust pipes are 
far from cosmetic. It doesn't simply pull away from the curb. It goes hunting. 
</P>
<P>
It is quick from 0 to 60 -- about two seconds quicker, in fact, than the 
Porsche 944. 
</P>
<P>
It has a top speed requiring a fuel cutoff should any owner get a bad case of 
the hastes -- faster, in fact, than a Ferrari 328GTS that costs about $50,000 
more. 
</P>
<P>
But to dwell on speed for more than a glimpse is to take away from the 
handling, control, balance and honest rapport of this car. In each category, 
the 300ZX simply is the finest car on the road today. 
</P>
<P>
And there, of course, is the gravy from that multilink suspension, viscous 
limited-slip differential and speed-sensitive steering that seemed so 
complicated a dozen paragraphs ago. 
</P>
<P>
Roll across ruts or lumps and this car sops them up with neither skip or kick 
through the steering. Turning in at 30 m.p.h. takes the same pressure as a 
quick lane change at 70 m.p.h. because the steering mechanicals are more 
sensitive than us. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is that dreadful, front-end lightness under load of so many of today's 
sportier vehicles. Back is a comfortable tendency to gentle oversteer and that 
gives you a fortnight's warning. 
</P>
<P>
The car is taut and solid and devoid of body roll. It seems to wear a tire 
patch (the area of tire contacting the road surface) as big as a bath towel. 
The net result is a 1990 muscle car that turns in, drives through and powers 
out of corners like it is riding on Garfield's suction cup paws. 
</P>
<P>
The 300ZX goes on sale this month. A 2+2 version will be offered this summer. A 
Turbo 300ZX will be along in October. 
</P>
<P>
The car will be a success. 
</P>
<P>
We could also become victims of that success. 
</P>
<P>
For when everyone has a 300ZX, when all novelty is diluted, how does one remain 
different? 
</P>
<P>
Said a Nissan spokesman: "You go out and buy the turbo version."

LETTER'S EFFECT ON OLD ACQUAINTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the letter by Dr. William Moss (April 2): 
</P>
<P>
We came to Santa Ana 33 years ago, the same year as Moss. We knew him then as a 
fine general surgeon who practiced high quality life-saving medicine. He later 
chose to limit his practice to life-preventing medicine (performing tubal 
ligations and vasectomies), and now he is specializing in life-destroying 
procedures. It saddens us to know that he is the face and name behind the 
Tustin abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
His letter of thanks to the Tustin police and the pro-choice advocates who were 
at his clinic to "protect" him and his patients has made us even more aware 
that those of us who are advocates of the pro-life cause -- which holds that 
all human life is sacred and has dignity and value -- must become more vocal 
and visible. 
</P>
<P>
It seems abortionists have protectors, animals have protectors, even car owners 
are told by an American manufacturer that "protection is your right." Only 
human babies not yet born are unprotected.

BEACHES BELONG TO ALL -- EVEN IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Tuesday, when temperatures soared over the 100-degree mark, the Huntington 
Beach City Council took an action that will make beachgoing more prohibitive 
for many residents: It slapped a $2 surcharge on the parking fee at city 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
That means that starting May 1, anyone using the municipal parking lots at the 
beach will have to pay a single-day parking fee of $6. The fee was levied to 
raise money to help rebuild the Huntington Beach pier that was badly damaged in 
last year's storms. 
</P>
<P>
At the same session, the City Council reduced the cost of annual parking passes 
for residents from $40 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of things wrong with those seemingly contradictory actions. 
If the city is so intent on raising money for the pier's reconstruction by 
increasing beach parking fees, why didn't it raise the rate for the residents' 
annual parking passes too? Or at least leave the residents' fee at the same 
level? 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Huntington Beach city officials noted that about 85% of people 
using city beaches last year were non-residents indicates their obvious intent 
to give local inhabitants a break and sock it to the out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, however, the city is also socking it to a lot of people who 
cannot afford costly entertainment and look forward to an outing at the beach 
as an inexpensive form of recreation. The $6 parking fee is high enough to lift 
more than occasional beachgoing out of their price range and make frequent 
attendance prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
We recognize that the influx of thousands of non-residents puts a strain on 
coastal communities, clogging local streets with traffic and requiring more 
money to be spent for certain city services, like police and road maintenance. 
But that is balanced out by the economic advantages of tourism that a coastal 
location provides, as well as the convenience and pleasure seaside residents 
enjoy living close to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
At times some residents and officials forget that the public beaches belong to 
everyone and that people from Costa Mesa and Corona have as much right to use 
them as they do. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal communities cannot put up fences to keep non-residents out. Charging 
exorbitant parking fees that limit public access to the beach amounts to the 
same thing.

IRVINE SEEN AS CITY MODEL FOR CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The need for quality, affordable child care in our communities is becoming more 
and more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
As you noted in a recent editorial, Irvine is at the forefront in the area of 
child care. On Dec. 15, 1987, the Irvine City Council, led by Mayor Larry 
Agran, unanimously passed a resolution stating the child care policy of the 
city: "That safe, affordable, quality child care facilities and services shall 
be available to those who reside and/or work in the city of Irvine and are in 
need of those facilities and services." (City Council Resolution No. 87-151). 
</P>
<P>
The objectives towards accomplishing this goal include providing licensed child 
care spaces for 60% of the children of employed parents living in Irvine by 
1992; providing affordable child care services in the city, and promoting the 
development of child care facilities in Irvine that are of the highest quality. 
Progress toward that goal is reviewed annually by the City Council and 
masterfully implemented by the city's child care coordinator and staff, in 
cooperation with many groups from both the public and private sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Child care is a top priority of Mayor Agran and the City Council. As a member 
of the Irvine Community Services Commission, I hope that our city can serve as 
a model for other cities in this area.

COMCAST CABLE RESPONDS TO LETTER ON REGULATING TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Mitchell Davis' letter regarding cable in Santa Ana ("Regulation 
of Cable TV at Issue in Santa Ana" (March 12), it should be noted that he holds 
an inaccurate perception of the facts concerning Comcast Cablevision's 
settlement with Santa Ana. Specifically: 
</P>
<P>
* Davis said, "Through aggressive lobbying and political campaign 
contributions, Comcast successfully breached its contract with Santa Ana." 
Comcast did not make any campaign contributions nor does it have a Political 
Action Committee that makes contributions. 
</P>
<P>
* Davis said Santa Ana gave up "control of local origination programming and 
interconnects with other cities." Santa Ana did give up control of local 
origination programming, but Comcast is guaranteeing more hours of programming 
than was being done by the city. 
</P>
<P>
* Davis said, "Santa Ana received nothing except items that Comcast was already 
contractually obligated to provide." To the contrary, Comcast will give the 
city $602,000 and will provide free use of a $2.5-million Institutional Network 
(I-Net). Use of the I-Net will save the city several hundred thousand dollars. 
The citizens of Santa Ana will receive credits totaling more than $1 million. 
Comcast was not under contractual obligation for any of these items. 
</P>
<P>
If the recommendations of Santa Ana's Cable TV Advisory Board were followed, 
the cable company rates would need to be $4.45 per month above those in other 
cities. Comcast has one of the lowest rates for basic cable service in Orange 
County. Furthermore, Comcast continues to charge the lowest rate in the area 
for premium service. These rates are achieved without sacrificing quality.

MEDICAL DIRECTOR PROTESTS ARTICLE ON BREA'S CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As medical director at Brea Hospital Neuropsychiatric Center since October, 
1986, and as the physician charged with responsibility for overseeing quality 
of care, I feel a professional and a personal obligation to respond to your 
article, "Poor Care of Patients Alleged at Brea Center (March 26)." 
</P>
<P>
A most unfortunate aspect of the entire article is that it is presented as 
"news," with the same immediacy as an event such as a plane crash yesterday. 
But there was no such event yesterday, last week, or even last year to occasion 
this "news report." 
</P>
<P>
Only two specific allegations relate to practices during my tenure. With 
limitations of space to offer a detailed reply, I will simply state that 
neither is true. Other allegations relate to matters of years ago, with none 
accepted today as truth, and yet when reported today as "news" by you, they 
carry that sense. Unchallenged, these are a disservice to the professional and 
employee staff of Brea, as well as to the patients and community we serve. 
</P>
<P>
I am even more dismayed with the allegations put forth by my colleague and 
fellow member, Irwin Rosenfeld of the Orange County Psychiatric Society. I 
resent him raising issues against my hospital in the press, when not one has 
ever been communicated to myself or to the hospital. Either his concerns are 
serious and should be referred for investigation and response -- or they 
aren't. 
</P>
<P>
I came to Brea Hospital as medical director to bring my values of respectful 
treatment in psychiatry to a larger forum than I had in dealing with individual 
patients. I am proud of the hospital and angry that its value does not show 
through your alleged "news" article. 
</P>
<P>
I protest.

DEFINING WETLANDS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Huntington Beach wetlands: 
</P>
<P>
Being an attorney for an involved landowner in the Huntington Beach Wetlands, 
Roy B. Woolsey should have used a more scientific definition of wetlands in his 
letter ('Dry Land and Wetland,' March 19). Courts generally defer to scientists 
or expert agencies on technical matters such as the definition of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Wetlands are not defined just on the basis of past survey maps but also, more 
importantly, on existing soil and vegetation characteristics peculiar to 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Assembly issued a report entitled "Status and Trends of California 
Wetlands." This report listed current methods of defining wetlands. For 
example, the various agencies define wetlands using criteria such as "saturated 
or seasonally saturated soil conditions" and "a prevalence of vegetation 
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions." 
</P>
<P>
If we are to comply with President Bush's campaign position that all existing 
wetlands, no matter how small, should be preserved, and if we are to observe 
the Environmental Protection Agency's policy stipulating no net loss of 
wetlands, then the wetlands along Coast Highway should be described in 
scientific documents and preserved, not lost to urban development.

TEACHER IS PRAISED, AND FINALLY NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my many years as a teacher I have encountered several fine and dedicated 
teachers, but there is one individual who is such a cut above and so 
exceptional that he is in a class by himself. You covered his class project in 
December when it launched the Mesa shuttle. Your coverage was excellent in 
every respect -- except you did not mention the teacher's name. 
</P>
<P>
Now Scott Stark's class has been chosen to represent the state of California in 
the national NASA "name the Challenger replacement shuttle." His name should be 
in lights for the year-in and year-out teaching he does. He inspires, motivates 
and excites all students to truly achieve their best. He does not forget 
students when they leave his classroom. He follows their high school and 
college careers with involved interest and guidance of class selection and 
career opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, he makes those people believe they can achieve the impossible. Now 
the state knows of him, and I'm convinced the country will as well when the 
winner is announced in May. For now your paper needs to recognize him by name: 
Scott Stark, Mesa View sixth-grade teacher.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Agassi waved the American flag first. Robert Seguso gave him a hug and 
took the flag. John McEnroe got it next and waved it vigorously, as though he 
were signaling a ship. Finally, it was Ken Flach's turn with the flag. 
</P>
<P>
It was sort of a relay race, a tag team of nationalism and a celebration of 
victory. That flag should have been whipping, because the United States won in 
a breeze Saturday evening at the San Diego Sports Arena in its Davis Cup 
quarterfinal showdown with France. 
</P>
<P>
Once Flach and Seguso had put away the French team of Yannick Noah and Guy 
Forget in 2 hours 55 minutes, four sets and two tiebreakers, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 
4-6, 7-6 (7-3), the U.S. team began celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? 
</P>
<P>
Said Seguso: "It was a very satisfying win." 
</P>
<P>
The doubles victory, coupled with Friday night's singles triumphs by McEnroe 
and Agassi, gave the United States an insurmountable 3-0 lead in the 
best-of-five competition, with today's two singles matches reduced to 
best-of-three sets. 
</P>
<P>
For the disappointed French, the postmatch analysis was not pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
"They played great when they had to and we played like little boys," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Davis Cup semifinal round, the United States will play in Europe against 
the winner of the West Germany-Czechoslovakia quarterfinal, which 
Czechoslovakia leads, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the U.S. team is thinking very positively. Flach said he thinks 
the United States can win it all. Seguso said he's only thinking about the next 
round. 
</P>
<P>
But until they subdued the stubborn French, what must Flach and Seguso have 
been thinking about their own game? It couldn't have been too positive. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso had won no more than one match in five Grand Prix tournaments 
this year. Only two weeks ago in Key Biscayne, Fla., they played one match and 
lost to Forget and his French teammate Eric Winogradsky. 
</P>
<P>
The explanation of what turned the U.S. doubles team around sounded simple to 
Flach: "We just needed a Davis Cup to get us started." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. players got started quickly against Noah, who seemed perfectly fit, 
and Forget, who may not have been fit because of his sore knees. 
</P>
<P>
With France playing to stay alive in the competition and the United States 
trying to clinch, the Americans could not get a single service break after the 
fifth game of the first set, but that was not the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely played two great tiebreakers," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
Steering toward the second one in the fourth set, the French got there when 
Forget held his serve at love. Then, with the tiebreaker on serve at 3-2, the 
match turned on a single, crucial service return. 
</P>
<P>
Forget jammed Flach with his serve, but Flach managed to send a forehand with 
something on it to Forget, who seemed unprepared. He sent the ball to Seguso, 
whose forehand volley winner eventually meant the match. 
</P>
<P>
Flach said he wanted to hit the ball aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been tentative, I would have popped it up," he said. "It went to the 
right place." 
</P>
<P>
Forget thought Flach guessed right on the serve, and that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say lucky, but it landed close to the line," Forget said. "All I could 
do was just put it back in Seguso's racket." 
</P>
<P>
On the first match point, Seguso placed a volley winner that Noah couldn't get. 
That brought out the flag. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier, chances appeared remote that the match would be decided in a 
fourth-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso took the first set with service breaks of Forget in the third 
game and Noah in the fourth. As 12,584 looked on, many waving tiny American 
flags, the service breaks disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
In the first-set tiebreaker, the United States went up, 3-2, when Seguso hit a 
big backhand service return crosscourt for a winner and closed it out in a 
hurry, 7-4, on Seguso's ace. 
</P>
<P>
Down two sets to none, Noah and Forget made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seguso was broken in the fourth game, which was all France needed, although the 
United States wasted two break points against Noah in the eighth game. Flach 
said the third set swirled with a momentum change and the United States only 
witnessed it. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't let up," he said. "There was a little momentum switch. They 
just picked up their level." 
</P>
<P>
After the 10-minute break between the third and fourth sets, Seguso nearly left 
his serve in the locker room. He fell behind, 15-40, but wriggled back to 
deuce, and on the first game point, Flach put away a backhand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
It was Flach's turn to struggle with his serve at 3-3. He faced a break point, 
but saved it with a withering service winner to Forget's backhand, which always 
seemed to be a good place to hit it. 
</P>
<P>
There were to be no more break points. And for France, there will be no more 
competition for this year's Davis Cup championship. After so much promise and 
high hopes, the proportions of the French defeat perplexed Noah. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about winning and when you lose that bad, it's embarrassing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, as confident as the U.S. team may have been, they did not expect to 
win in just three matches, although Flach said he was certainly grateful that's 
how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of the matches seemed like a tossup," he said. "For us to dominate, 
I guess it was kind of a surprise."

JIM MURRAY: SOMETIMES, THE FAVORITE ISN'T THE BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Jim Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
Houston was supposed to be a wonder horse. A combination of Man o' War, 
Pegasus, Black Beauty, Trigger, the Pony Express and a unicorn. He could do 
everything but arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to win Saturday's Santa Anita Derby by an eighth of a mile. He 
had Lafitt Pincay on him, he was trained by Wayne Lukas and he cost $2.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if I paid $2.9 million for a horse, I'd at least want him to talk. Or 
rescue a cowboy from a burning building, untie damsels from a railroad track, 
or go tug on the hero and drag him to save a schoolmarm from a fate worse than 
death. 
</P>
<P>
It was a foregone conclusion he would win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
He scared everybody out of the Santa Anita Derby. Owners and trainers ducked 
the race in droves when Houston passed the entry box. 
</P>
<P>
The betting public was awed. Here was a horse that had run only three races in 
his life, had never run a mile, had never beaten much of anything -- and they 
stormed the windows to get down on him -- to bet $277,336 on him to win alone, 
and knock him down to 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
He only beat one horse, a 46-1 sprinter who packed it in after six of the nine 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a wonder horse in the Santa Anita field Saturday, it was the horse 
trained by the canny old conditioner, Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects Sunday Silence to save the fort, untie the star, carry the mail 
or leave a note for the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
But he did what Santa Anita Derby winners have to do to have a chance in 
Kentucky next month -- beat his field by so much daylight it looked like two 
different races. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Winning Colors did last year. That's what Affirmed did, in his 
year, and Lucky Debonair, Majestic Prince and most winners of the Santa Anita 
Derby who went on to double in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions. Gato Del Sol finished fourth at Santa Anita the year he 
was first in Kentucky; Ferdinand finished third. 
</P>
<P>
But usually, you have to beat inferiors by a lot to have a chance when the big 
boys show up at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
When you pay almost $3 million for an athlete, you want him to put you in the 
World Series, the Super Bowl, hit .400 or beat the Celtics. If he's a horse, 
the least he should do is win a prep race for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Houston didn't. He was beaten by a horse who not only didn't cost nearly $3 
million, he didn't even cost quite $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his owner, Arthur Hancock III, kept trying to get rid of him. He did 
everything but leave him on a doorstep with a note on him. He kept vanning him 
to auctions, hoping somebody would buy him, hoping they wouldn't notice he was 
knock-kneed, kind of fiddle-headed and apt to wobble when he walked, like a 
teen-ager at a prom in her first pair of high heels. 
</P>
<P>
Horse people were too smart for that. They passed on Sunday Silence. They 
figured if they needed something to pull a plow, they could get one a whole lot 
cheaper than the $50,000 minimum Hancock wanted for the horse. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of David Harums in the horse business, but Arthur Hancock 
wasn't one of them in this instance. He was offering a colt who was by the sire 
Halo, who already had fathered a Kentucky Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't as if Sunday Silence were a runty little derelict with a cropped tail 
who looked like a large mouse or something you'd find starving on the range in 
the snow. He's a big, strapping, black 3-year-old, over 16 hands high, 1,100 
pounds of glowing coat. If he was human, he'd be a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
He won his race Saturday by 11 widening lengths. That's the horse race 
equivalent of a one-round knockout. The time, 1:47 3/5 was impressive for a 
horse winning by 11 lengths. He wasn't even breathing hard. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what happened to Houston, beaten by 16 3/4 lengths, but sobering 
news came to the whole field just before the start of the race. In New York, 
the East's big hope for Kentucky, Easy Goer, indicated he may not only be the 
horse everyone thought Houston was, but better. He not only won his race by 13 
lengths, he came within a fifth of a second of the world record (held by Dr. 
Fager) in doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Can a horse whose owners kept putting him in a window and saying, in effect, 
"Owner Desperate -- Make Offer" keep up in Kentucky with a world record 
challenger? 
</P>
<P>
Horsemen don't like confrontations. More to their liking is for each to go 
looking for something they can whip, like a pugilist fighting his chauffeur in 
tank towns. 
</P>
<P>
But, maybe they owe it to Sunday Silence to give him his shot at immortality. 
After having shopped him around like a fake diamond by a guy in a checked suit 
on a street corner, it might be time they showed a little faith in their colt. 
After all, he's already licked one wonder horse. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, maybe Easy Goer really can talk. Or, maybe, he's a 
vaudeville horse, two guys on wheels in a horse suit. 
</P>
<P>
If not, they might have the first match race in Kentucky Derby history. Anyone 
who would pay $20,000 to challenge these two would probably look up Mike Tyson 
at 4 o'clock in the morning and ask him what he hears from Robin.

GOALIE ROY GETS SOLID SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRICE, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some athletes have found success by pumping iron. Patrick Roy has done it by 
talking to iron. 
</P>
<P>
It all started one night in Hartford in 1986 when the Montreal Canadiens 
goaltender cast a steely gaze at the goal posts during the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Something about the posts looked different to Roy. They were smaller, maybe, 
skinnier. Anyway, ever since, Roy has looked at National Hockey League goal 
posts as conversation pieces. 
</P>
<P>
It might start with a pregame pep talk: 
</P>
<P>
Roy: OK. Be ready. Watch for Babych's slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
Goal post: (Silence). 
</P>
<P>
Later, after a shot has rung the goal post's bell: 
</P>
<P>
Roy: Nice save. 
</P>
<P>
Goal post: (Silence). 
</P>
<P>
The first time Roy actually spoke to a goal post was in Boston, right after his 
Hartford experience. The Canadiens went on to gain a tie after Ray Bourque's 
slap shot clanked off the post behind Roy. The tie broke a six-game losing 
streak, and a superstition was born. 
</P>
<P>
"Goalies are always alone in the game," Roy said. "He needs superstitious 
things." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens won the Stanley Cup after the pipeline of communication was 
opened, and Roy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player in the 
playoffs. This year, if goal posts could have anything to say about it, Roy 
will win the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
Roy is a big reason the Canadiens won the Adams Division this season and are 
leading the Hartford Whalers in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 23, led the league this season with a 2.47 goals-against average, and he 
was in net for the first two games of the playoff series in Montreal. His home 
record this season is 27-0-4. 
</P>
<P>
Roy's style created some skepticism about his ability his first couple years in 
Montreal. Whalers center Ray Ferraro has described him as "Jell-O without the 
mold," and TV analyst Gerry Cheevers has said Roy is "no oil painting." 
</P>
<P>
But he gets the job done. In Game 2 Thursday night with the Whalers carrying 
the attack, Roy flagged down a blast by Dave Babych. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a three-save sequence with the score 1-0 Montreal, Roy was brilliant, 
especially in flailing out an arm to knock down a backhand rebound bid by 
Babych. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy definitely made some big saves at the times in the game when a goal would 
have looked pretty good to us," Whalers Coach Larry Pleau said. 
</P>
<P>
Roy attributes his fine year to his teammates, experience and better 
concentration and maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I was more consistent than my first few years," Roy said. "If I 
compared season by season this was by far my best season. My concentration was 
at a good level all year. I cut maybe a bad goal a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Three, four years in the NHL you're going to mature a little bit. I think I 
stopped thinking too much. Now when I lose a game, I know I did my best and I 
can take the positives." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal Coach Pat Burns has used Roy almost exclusively at home and gone with 
Brian Hayward more on the road. The 218 goals allowed by the Canadiens this 
season was the lowest in the NHL in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Both our goalies have been more consistent this season," Canadiens defenseman 
Craig Ludwig said. "As a team we've been more consistent. Games we've had 
problems, the goalies have seemed to pull us through, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat has been super. He's made big saves all year, key saves. That's what you 
need in the playoffs. What's going to win it is goaltending and making the big 
saves." 
</P>
<P>
Roy dismisses the theory that it is easier playing goal for the Canadiens 
because of their defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The best statistic is save percentage," Roy said. "It doesn't matter which 
team you play for, you have to stop the puck." 
</P>
<P>
Roy led the NHL with a .908 save percentage this season. 
</P>
<P>
The only competition Roy will get for the Vezina is Mike Vernon of Calgary, who 
had a 37-6-5 record, a 2.65 goals-against-average and an .897 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my chances," Roy said, "but I'm not thinking about it. Right now, 
what's important is to help my teammates and go as far as we can in the 
playoffs."

ANGELS' 7-0 DEFEAT PINNED ON ABBOTT, NOT ALL THE BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Angels didn't precisely soar, trumpets did indeed blare -- there was a 
pregame battle of the bands -- on the night of Jim Abbott's major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
There were also ticket lines longer than those down the street at the 
Matterhorn, four Japanese television crews on location and enough curiosity to 
fill 46,847 seats at Anaheim Stadium Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the clamor and great expectation of the occasion, Angel Manager Doug Rader 
stopped squinting into the camera lights long enough to make a simple request 
concerning Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope he enjoys it," Rader said. "A player's first day in the big 
leagues should be enjoyable, something to savor and remember. But it seems with 
Jim, all this attention might take that away from him, and that would be too 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
As Abbott discovered in his career-opening 7-0 loss to the Seattle Mariners, 
such simple things in life are not always that simple. 
</P>
<P>
Standing alone on the mound that served as his private eye in the hurricane, 
Abbott surrendered hits to the first two batters he faced as a professional and 
allowed two runs in his first professional inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the second inning: Side retired, 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
And the third: Error, single and walk to load the bases; double play to emerge 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
And the fourth: Side down again, 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, very finally, the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Betrayed by his nerves, his teammates' defense and a twist of luck, Abbott 
yielded four runs in the fifth, leaving the game, trailing, 6-0, with one more 
out needed to end the inning. All of the runs scored after Angel second baseman 
Mark McLemore botched a potential double-play grounder, with the first two 
coming home on a broken-bat flare to right by Seattle's Alvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the runs were unearned, but that statistic was of little consequence 
or consolation to Abbott afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disappointed," Abbott said from behind the podium during a 
postgame press conference. "I don't think I threw too well. I felt sometimes I 
battled OK and I made some pitches I'm proud of, but overall, I didn't do as 
much as I'm capable of." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers supported such an assessment. In 4 2/3 innings, Abbott allowed six 
runs (three earned) on six hits, three walks and one wild pitch. Of the 83 
pitches he threw, Mariner batters swung and missed only twice. Abbott did not 
strike out a batter, had as many as two strikes in the count only five times 
and surrendered Davis' crushing bloop single on an 0-and-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was a little unnerved by all the attention," Abbott said. "Today, 
maybe my mind wasn't as clearly focused as I'd have liked it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Rader certainly saw it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this poor guy's been going through this," Rader said as his 
took his turn behind the microphone in the crowded interview room. "Under the 
conditions, I thought he pitched outstanding. Had it not been for a misplayed 
ball and a bloop hit, it would've been a different ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I thought he handled himself very well." 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were unprecedented. Abbott, 21, is the 15th player to make 
the jump from high school or college to the major leagues since the inception 
of baseball's amateur draft in 1965 -- but the first to do it with one hand. 
</P>
<P>
Such distinguishing traits made Abbott the major story of the Angels' training 
camp, as well as a focus of controversy when the Angels announced that they 
would begin the 1989 regular season with Abbott not only on the roster, but in 
the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
There were immediate charges of publicity-mongering, of using Abbott to sell 
tickets in the short term at the long-term expense of his baseball career. The 
Angels, and Rader in particular, were second-guessed for rushing Abbott to the 
major leagues without the benefit of minor league development. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott could have gotten a little more help from his teammates Saturday night. 
The Angels managed just six hits against Seattle starter Mark Langston (1-1), 
who struck out seven and didn't walk a batter, and committed a pair of errors 
-- shortstop Dick Schofield's in the third inning and McLemore's 
floodgate-opener in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
With one out and a runner on first base, Harold Reynolds hit a grounder 
McLemore should have fielded but didn't, and instead of an inning-ending double 
play, Seattle had runners at second and third, prompting Abbott to walk Henry 
Cotto intentionally to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott got two strikes on Davis and broke his bat on the third pitch, only to 
have the baseball land on the grass in shallow right field, bringing home two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Two more runs would score on Darnell Coles' infield out and Jeff Leonard's 
single. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could do it over again," Abbott said afterward. "But maybe it's for 
the best that the first one's out of the way. I think I was a bit unnerved by 
the attention and it's nice to have that out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can build on this and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
If only the rest of the world will let him. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott and Co.: The Angel rookie became the 15th player to make his 
professional debut in the majors since 1965 and the inception of baseball's 
amateur draft. Abbott is the first since 1985, when outfielder Pete Incaviglia 
went straight from Oklahoma State to the Texas Rangers. The rest of the list: 
pitcher Mike Adamson (Baltimore, 1967); pitcher Steve Dunning (Cleveland, 
1969); pitcher Pete Broberg (Washington, 1971); pitcher Burt Hooton (Chicago 
Cubs, 1971); third baseman Dave Roberts (San Diego, 1972); pitcher Dick Ruthven 
(Philadelphia, 1973); outfielder Dave Winfield (San Diego, 1973); pitcher David 
Clyde (Texas, 1973); pitcher Eddie Bane (Minnesota, 1973); third baseman Bob 
Horner (Atlanta, 1978); catcher Brian Milner (Toronto, 1978); pitcher Mike 
Morgan (Oakland, 1978); and pitcher Tim Conroy (Oakland, 1978). . . . Add List: 
Of the pitchers, only Hooton had a winning record (2-0) in his first season. 
The combined first-year record of the other eight pitchers: 19-44. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader started a lineup featuring Tony Armas in right field (and 
batting cleanup), Dante Bichette in center field, Bill Schroeder at catcher and 
Glenn Hoffman at third base. "We wanted to give Devon (White) and Lance 
(Parrish) the day off," Rader explained. "Also, Jack Howell hasn't had much 
success against Mark Langston and Claudell (Washington) has never faced him 
before." Howell has a .188 career batting average against Langston, but he's 
not the only Angel who doesn't hit the Seattle left-hander. Through 1988, 
Parrish was .143 (2 for 14) against him, White .095 (2 for 21), Wally Joyner 
.158 (3 for 19) and Dick Schofield .138 (4 for 29). Joyner and Schofield 
remained in the starting lineup, however, because somebody had to play.

<P>
Czechoslovakia took a 2-1 lead over defending champion West Germany in their 
Davis Cup World Group quarterfinal by winning the doubles match in five sets 
Saturday at Prague, Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Milan Srejber and Petr Korda beat Boris Becker and Eric Jelen, 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 
3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3, in 3 hours 47 minutes to put Czechoslovakia one victory 
away from the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In today's deciding singles, Srejber takes on Becker while Carl-Uwe Steeb plays 
Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans need to take both singles to win. The winner of the Prague 
match will meet the United States in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth-set tiebreaker, a linesman nearly handed the match to West 
Germany when he called Srejber for a foot fault. Srejber then double-faulted, 
and Jelen had the chance to close out the match. But he netted a simple volley 
and then double-faulted. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who served 22 aces in beating Novacek in straight sets in the opening 
singles Friday, dropped his serve for the third time to give the Czechs a 2-0 
lead in the final set. Becker had only six aces Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Srejber, who defeated Steeb in straight sets Friday, served out the match on 
his first match point when Jelen netted a return. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg and Anders Jarryd beat Horst Skoff and Alexander Antonitsch, 6-3, 
6-1, 6-3, to give Sweden a 2-1 lead over Austria in their quarterfinal at 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Skoff upset Mats Wilander in a six-hour marathon match, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 
(9-7), 1-6, 6-4, 9-7, after Edberg overpowered Antonitsch, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Two Yugoslav 6-footers fired a total of 27 aces to give Yugoslavia an 
unbeatable 3-0 lead over Spain in their quarterfinal at Split, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Slobodan Zivojinovic and Goran Ivanisevic defeated Emilio Sanchez and Sergio 
Casal, 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 13-11, in a four-hour battle. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will next play the Sweden-Austria winner.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EXPOS LIMIT METS TO FOUR HITS IN 3-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets, apparently convinced they are the best team in baseball, are 
not about to be deterred by a little thing like an early-season batting slump. 
</P>
<P>
Four Expo hurlers held them to four hits Saturday at Montreal and the Mets 
lost, 3-2, their third defeat in a row after a victory in the opener over St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In their mild skid, the Mets have scored six runs and accumulated only 16 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry was the spokesman for the Mets, who have been favored by many 
to win everything for the last three seasons, but have done it only once. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason to panic," he said. "We were 2-3 last season after five 
games, so it isn't that much different. We really haven't got out of the box, 
and we haven't put anything together since the opener. Maybe Doc (Dwight 
Gooden) can change things tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
While the Mets are playing down their shortcomings, it was an exciting day for 
rookie relief pitcher Gene Harris of the Expos, who are 4-1. He gave up a hit 
and a run in two innings, but was the pitcher of record when Spike Owen hit a 
seventh-inning sacrifice fly to snap a 1-1 tie and put the Expos ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting, even if I did give up the run to get the victory," said Harris, 
a 24-year-old right-hander. "After all, the first one was against the best team 
in baseball. Maybe, I can start a trophy case with this ball." 
</P>
<P>
Bryn Smith pitched two-hit ball for the first five innings and Tim Burke got 
the last three outs to save it. David Cone (20-3 last year) lost his first 
start, giving up two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- Domingo Ramos has been in and out of the majors 
since he played one game with the New York Yankees in 1978. Much of the time 
was spent as a little-known utility infielder for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
He is becoming better known in Chicago. When Shawon Dunston suffered a 
hamstring injury Thursday, Ramos, 31, took over at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos had two hits and scored a run in the Cubs' 6-5 victory Friday and came 
right back in this game to hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to put 
the Cubs in front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third loss in a row for the Pirates after a win in the opener. A 
former Pirate, Mike Bielecki, got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, St. Louis 4 -- Mike Schmidt continues to provide the spark to 
the Phillies' offense. He doubled in the 11th inning at Philadelphia and scored 
on Ricky Jordan 's double. 
</P>
<P>
After Tom Brunansky's two-run home run in the fifth off Don Carman gave the 
Cardinals a 4-2 lead, the Phillies battled back. 
</P>
<P>
Dickie Thon doubled in the eighth inning to chase Scott Terry. With Von Hayes 
up, the Cardinals brought in left-hander Ken Dayley. Against left-handers last 
year, Hayes batted .129. 
</P>
<P>
However, he tagged Dayley for a game-tying home run. It was the first home run 
off Dayley since Darryl Strawberry of the Mets hit one Oct. 1, 1985, at Busch 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 6, San Diego 2 -- Jim Clancy gave up six hits and struck out eight in 8 
1/3 innings at Houston and breezed to his first National League victory. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy, signed as a free agent to a three-year contract for $3.45 million, 
outpitched another former American Leaguer, Walt Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy gave up doubles to Garry Templeton and Terrell for a run in the fifth, 
then departed after Marvell Wynne homered in the ninth. DAN HAFNER

INJURY PROBLEMS WILL PUT BREWERS' DEPTH TO EARLY-SEASON TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new math disturbs Tom Trebelhorn, the Milwaukee Brewer manager who used to 
be a substitute teacher in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, despite injuries that forced Brewer players to lose 750 games to the 
disabled list, Trebelhorn's team finished only two games behind the Boston Red 
Sox in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only a few days into a race many believe the Brewers can win, the club's 
15-, 21- and 30-day disabled lists are already at their limits. 
</P>
<P>
Employing the calculator of his mind, Trebelhorn said: 
</P>
<P>
"We're missing only 25% of the team, but it's actually more than that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a 20-game winner (Ted Higuera), an All-Star infielder 
(Paul Molitor), a switch-hitting shortstop with power (Dale Sveum), a talented 
left-handed pitcher (Juan Nieves) and a guy who has hit cleanup for us (Greg 
Brock). 
</P>
<P>
"It's 25% for us statistically, but it's probably 40% of our effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, recovering from back surgery, and Molitor, who dislocated a finger in 
some late-spring horseplay, are on the 15-day list and expected to rejoin the 
team within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers Nieves and Tom Filer and first baseman Brock are on the 21-day list 
with no timetable for their return. Brock, the former Dodger who escaped Steve 
Garvey's shadow and found a home in Milwaukee in 1987, missed two months of 
last season with a rib injury and had arthroscopic shoulder surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sveum, still recovering from a broken leg suffered last September, is on the 
30-day list and facing more than 30 days before he will be ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
Another injury would force the Brewers to move one of the aforementioned 
players to the 60-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a limit on the number of players who can be on the 60-day list? 
</P>
<P>
"No, but we may exceed that," General Manager Harry Dalton said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Terry Francona, who has never hit more than three home runs or 
driven in more than 31 runs in a season, is replacing Brock as the cleanup 
hitter, and former Angel Gus Polidor, with a .227 lifetime average, is 
replacing third baseman Molitor, a .299 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"In spring training, we thought we had our best depth in years," Dalton said. 
"Now we'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Howard Johnson of the New York Mets made two throwing errors in 
Wednesday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, giving him 10 in the 20 games 
he had played since the start of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Said first baseman Keith Hernandez: "He can throw sidearm, underarm or 
whatever, if he just throws in the vicinity of first base. I'll cover him. I'm 
on a 24-hour watch over there." 
</P>
<P>
A Thursday rainout cost Sid Fernandez his first start of the season, and he was 
then informed by Met pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre that he won't be starting 
for 10 to 12 days as the club goes with a four-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez suggested that he wished one of the many trade rumors in which he has 
been involved would come true, that he has wearied of the Mets' routine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to feel good about yourself and get yourself in a good frame of mind 
when they treat you like a piece of . . . ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is it always me? I'm sick of it. I've been in this league five years and 
I'm treated like a nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stottlemyre: "I hate to do it to anyone, but I have to do it to someone 
because of the off-days. It's not any easier doing it with him than with anyone 
else. I expect him to be upset. But I'd rather have one guy upset than five 
guys fouled up and pitching on a seven-day rotation." 
</P>
<P>
Frustration already seems to be eating at the New York Yankees, who have lost 
shortstop Rafael Santana for the season, right fielder Dave Winfield for at 
least half the season, and were also without first baseman Don Mattingly, 
sidelined by back spasms, for the three-game opening series at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, free agents Andy Hawkins, making $3.6 million for three years, and 
Dave LaPoint, at $2.575 million for three years, were pounded in games two and 
three, the Yankees being outscored by the Twins, 19-3, and outhit, 27-11. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration seemed to show when Hawkins, in game two, and Dave Righetti, in 
game three, threw fastballs close to Kent Hrbek's head, sending Hrbek to the 
mound for a brief talk with Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
It was in evidence again later, when Righetti and LaPoint both said they 
thought the Twins were stealing their catcher's signs from a center-field 
camera. That claim was first made by Dick Williams while he was managing the 
Seattle Mariners and was supported, LaPoint said, by St. Louis Cardinal Manager 
Whitey Herzog during the 1987 World Series because the Twins "couldn't touch 
(John) Tudor in St. Louis, but lit him up here." 
</P>
<P>
Said Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly, pointing out that LaPoint pitched a perfect 
four innings and still had a shutout through five: 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can figure is the sign-stealer slept late or couldn't get out 
of work to get here on time. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he thought it was a night game." 
</P>
<P>
What does Manager Jimy Williams of the Toronto Blue Jays like best about his 
team's new uniforms? 
</P>
<P>
"I've got one," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Moreland, sensing he is the 24th player among the 24 Detroit Tigers, 
hopes to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know what the 24th player does," Moreland said. "I guess he warms 
up pitchers between innings. I wish they'd put me out of my misery." 
</P>
<P>
How much do the Tigers miss Kirk Gibson? 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 through 1987, Gibson's prime years in Detroit, there were only six 
complete-game shutouts pitched against the Tigers by right handers. 
</P>
<P>
But just since the start of the 1988 season, coinciding with Gibson's 
departure, there have been seven, the latest by the Texas Rangers' Charlie 
Hough on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Phillies opened the season by winning two of three from the 
Chicago Cubs, but how long can it last? The Phillies' first three starters -- 
Floyd Youmans, Ken Howell and Steve Ontiveros -- pitched a total of 151 1/3 
innings last year and were a combined 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs? 
</P>
<P>
"That team has the potential to be very, very bad," said Jody Davis, the former 
Cub catcher now with the very, very bad Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
And another former Cub, Rafael Palmeiro, now with the Rangers, said: "Do I care 
how the Cubs do? Why should I? They don't care about me." 
</P>
<P>
As will Frank Viola and Jeff Reardon of the Minnesota Twins, Mark Gubicza of 
the Kansas City Royals said he plans to pursue free agency when the season 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
Gubicza, 20-8 last year, hoped to sign a multiyear contract before the season 
started. He reportedly wanted a three-year deal for $5.3 million, but the 
Royals wouldn't go higher than $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are wondering if I can do it again," he said. "I think my 
teammates believe in me, but I'm not sure anyone else does." 
</P>
<P>
Gubicza lives in Northridge, within driving distance of Dodger and Anaheim 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
Royal owner Avron Fogelman disputes the contention of former commissioner Peter 
Ueberroth that all 26 clubs made money last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fogelman, the Royals have lost money in each of the last two 
years, primarily because they pay the city an annual stadium maintenance fee of 
$5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Kansas City does not have the geographical makeup to have a major league 
baseball team," Fogelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just do not have the inherent demographics that put us in a competitive 
position and we may as well face facts and not kid ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining rhetoric? What else? 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Indians played Milwaukee five times in spring training but never 
pitched Greg Swindell, who beat the Brewers on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Indians intentionally hiding Swindell, with opening day in mind? 
</P>
<P>
"It's more important to get your pitchers in shape than play those CIA games," 
Manager Doc Edwards said. "That stuff went out with high-button shoes."

Ex Marks the Spot: Eight former Dodger pitchers registered victories the first 
two days of the 1989 season: Rick Sutcliffe, Jerry Reuss, Tommy John, Charlie 
Hough, Brian Holton, Dave Stewart, Ken Howell and Bob Welch. A ninth, John 
Franco, saved the Cincinnati Reds' first two wins. 
</P>
<P>
Add Ex: The current major league rosters include 28 products of the New York 
Yankees' farm system, more than any American League team. Only five are with 
the Yankees, however: Don Mattingly, Mike Pagliarulo, Roberto Kelly, Al Leiter 
and Steve Balboni, whom the team recently re-acquired. 
</P>
<P>
Striking Start: Rob Deer of the Milwaukee Brewers and Pete Incaviglia of the 
Texas Rangers each have struck out 150 times or more in three consecutive 
seasons. Reggie Jackson is the only player ever to have struck out that many 
times in that many seasons -- consecutive or otherwise. Deer got off to a 
strong start in his bid to make it four in a row, striking out three times on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsupport: The New York Mets averaged only 2.97 runs in Bob Ojeda's 29 starts 
last year and were right back to old habits Wednesday when Ojeda lost to the 
St. Louis Cardinals, 3-1. Said Ojeda, who nearly lost the tip of a finger in a 
gardening accident last September and didn't know if he would ever pitch again: 
"I'm not happy about losing, but I'm happy to be able to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Hitless Wonders: The Kansas City Royals opened the season by winning two of 
three from the Toronto Blue Jays despite a combined one for 29 by Willie 
Wilson, Kevin Seitzer and George Brett, who constitute the top third of the 
batting order. Brett went hitless in the first three games for the first time 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Southpaws: Kirk Gibson's opening-day homer matched the number of home runs the 
Cincinnati Reds' Danny Jackson yielded to left-handed hitters in 134 at-bats 
last year. And the San Diego Padres' Bruce Hurst, who allowed only two homers 
to left-handers in 147 at-bats as a member of the Boston Red Sox last year, 
allowed one to Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants in his first start with 
the Padres. Of his opening-day stuff, Hurst said: "I could have hit it and I'm 
the world's worst hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Brave Start: By winning two of the three games in their opening series against 
the Houston Astros, the Atlanta Braves moved over .500 for the first time since 
June 20, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Game Winner: While batting .307 with the Chicago Cubs last season, Rafael 
Palmeiro became the first player to hit .300 and not have one game-winning run 
batted in. Thursday night, Palmeiro singled in the winning run in the Texas 
Rangers' 5-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers. This year, however, baseball has 
eliminated the game-winning RBI from its official statistics. ROSS NEWHAN

Jim Booros and Mike Donald shot four-under-par 66s Saturday to continue sharing 
the lead in the $200,000 Deposit Guaranty golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The two players, close friends off the course, were at 199 after 54 holes on 
the Hattiesburg Country Club's 6,280-yard course. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather play with a friend like this," Booros said. "Mike said a few 
things that relaxed me." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Thompson, David Peoples and Fred Funk shot 65s, and Lance Ten Broeck, 
who was in third place by himself going into the round, had a 67. All were at 
201. 
</P>
<P>
P.H. Horgan III, whose 64 was the day's best round was at 202 with Steve Lowery 
and Bob Wolcott. Lowery shot a 65 and Wolcott a 66. 
</P>
<P>
Donald, third at the Woodlands last week after leading for three rounds, 
started fast Saturday with three straight birdies. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped back with bogeys on the sixth and ninth holes but made three more 
birdies on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
Booros, who has held or shared the lead in all three rounds here, had an 
eagle-3 on the 482-yard third hole and a fine save for par at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
He birdied Nos. 11 and 13, had a bogey at the 15th and finished with a birdie 
on the 18th. The bogey was only his second of the tournament.

games remaining.

LPGA NEEDS SELLING JOB, AND NEW COMMISSIONER SAYS HE'S MAN TO DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a public address announcer at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion in the 1960s, Bill Blue 
was accustomed to introducing athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he was the freshman game announcer while getting his master's 
degree in business at the school. 
</P>
<P>
He had some marquee names to introduce, Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), 
Lynn Shackelford and Lucius Allen, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's trying to put the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. into the spotlight as 
its new commissioner. Blue, 48, succeeded John Laupenheimer, who resigned last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of popularity, exposure and prize money, the LPGA tour lags behind the 
PGA Tour. Moreover, now that the Senior PGA Tour is flourishing, the LPGA has a 
bit of an indentity problem. 
</P>
<P>
Blue, a former director of international marketing, only talks about the 
positive aspects of the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
A salesman with a plan, he is visible at all tournaments, such as the recent 
Nabisco Dinah Shore in Rancho Mirage. And he'll be bustling around the press 
room and golf course this week at the AI Star/Centinela Hospital tournament at 
Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't find any negatives," Blue said of the LPGA. "What I found was an 
organization going through growing pains, that didn't have any of the marketing 
acuity that the other two tours had. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so simple. The focus is that we concentrate on being the premier women's 
professional sports organization in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We're competing against women. We aren't competing against anyone else. And we 
have to go out and let enough sponsors know that our targets are women. I think 
it will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the men's tour is on television every week, either cable or network, 
the women's sometimes operates in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"The only competitive area (with the other tours) is for available television 
time," Blue said. "And with the explosion of cable network, we don't see that 
as a problem. We have plenty of opportunities and we're going to exercise those 
by next year." 
</P>
<P>
Blue estimates that the LPGA will have 19 cable or network exposures this year, 
having lost a few televised events from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't been terribly active in this area," he said. "Next year, when 
it's all said and done, we should have a total of 27 to 30 events. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that if I had been here two years earlier, we would be 
significantly ahead of where we are right now, simply because of common-sense 
marketing and working to get windows (of publicity) ahead of the fact, rather 
than relying on each individual tournament to sell itself." 
</P>
<P>
As a marketing man, Blue said, he is contacting advertising agencies and 
specific corporations who already have women as a target market. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making presentations to them on the benefits of looking at the LPGA as 
an adjunct to their marketing program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just the tour. We have a fast-growing teaching division, which is our 
equivalent to the PGA of America. We are also working with communities in terms 
of building a junior golf program and programs for women only." 
</P>
<P>
Although Nancy Lopez and Amy Alcott are women golfers who are generally known 
to the public, the women's tour lacks the name attraction that goes with the 
PGA and senior tours. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we can (promote the players) is to get ourselves on television and be 
more involved with the press," Blue said. "If we could have had the exposure 
that the PGA Tour and seniors had on a normal basis, the names of Betsy King, 
Sherri Turner and Juli Inkster would be much better known than they are. They 
are every bit as good as, and in some instances, better players than the women 
stars we once knew." 
</P>
<P>
So for Blue, an avid golfer who plays to an eight handicap, it's blue skies 
ahead for the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't have designed a better position for me," he said. "Nobody could 
be happier than I am to get a chance to exercise business, leadership and 
public relations skills and love of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez will defend her title in the AI Star/Centinela event, beginning with 
first-round play Friday over the 6,191-yard Rancho Park course. 
</P>
<P>
She shot a six-under-par 210 in 1988 and was tied with Marta Figueras-Dotti at 
the end of 54-hole regulation play. Lopez won the tournament on the second 
playoff hole 
</P>
<P>
A field of 144 will begin teeing off at 7:30 a.m. Friday. First prize in the 
$450,000 event is $67,500. 
</P>
<P>
Separate pro-ams Wednesday and Thursday at Rancho will precede tournament play. 
There also will be a free junior clinic Tuesday, starting at 4:30 p.m. on the 
Rancho Park practice range. About 300 juniors, 8 through 17, are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Hord Hardin, chairman of the Masters tournament, is concerned that escalating 
purses at other tournaments may lure the pros away from the Masters in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange, who became the first player to earn $1 million in a tour season 
in 1988, said that Hardin's concern is unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. Hardin is exaggerating if he actually believes that," Strange 
said. "He doesn't know what the Masters means to the players. I've been 
thinking about this tournament for a long, long time. The purse means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Apprised of Strange's comments, Hardin said: "I like to hear that, but I don't 
know if the younger players have the same feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The Champions Locker Room at the Augusta National course is reserved for past 
winners of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the former winners are uneasy about their exclusive quarters. Others 
favor it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice, but in a way it's not nice that they separate the guys," Bernhard 
Langer said. "You've won and you can come in here and the people who haven't 
won can't. We don't don't like to think that way." 
</P>
<P>
Said Craig Stadler: "I don't believe it is any advantage at all. I don't eat up 
there very often. I eat at the other locker room, with some of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "However, it's kind of nice, a special thing for the champions, 
and I think they should keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tom Watson: "There are so many media people here that you can't go 
anywhere to get away from the questions. When you're contending for the 
Masters, you need some time to think and get ready. When we were down in the 
other locker room, we didn't have that time." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Lanny Wadkins and Blaine McCallister were playing the 
par-three course at Augusta in preparation for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
They had a $100 bet if either made a hole-in-one. 
</P>
<P>
On the eighth hole, Wadkins hit his tee shot down the slope on the back of the 
green. He figured that his ball had gone into the water behind the green. 
</P>
<P>
So he teed up another ball and aced the hole with a pitching wedge. Did he win 
the bet? 
</P>
<P>
No way. McCallister told Wadkins the bet was off, saying, "I don't count 
mulligans." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Pride of the Foothills invitational tournament is scheduled May 5-7 at the 
Glendora Country Club. . . . The $2.5-million Nabisco Championships, richest 
event on the PGA Tour, will be played at Houston's Champions Golf Club in 1990.

EDWIN POPE WINS RED SMITH AWARD

<P>
Sports editor Edwin Pope of the Miami Herald has been named the winner of the 
Red Smith Award, presented by the Associated Press Sports Editors for "major 
contributions to sports journalism." 
</P>
<P>
Pope, 60, is the ninth and youngest winner of the annual award, which honors 
lifetime achievement. The award was created in 1981 by the APSE and is named 
for the late New York Times sports columnist. 
</P>
<P>
"For anyone to get any sort of award with Red Smith's name on it is a 
once-in-a-lifetime thing," Pope said. "You talk with athletes at the Super 
Bowl, World Series, Final Four and Kentucky Derby about that being their dream 
come true. But this is the type of thing you don't even dream about because it 
would be presumptuous." 
</P>
<P>
Pope has been writing about sports for 49 years. During that time, he has been 
one of the country's most-honored sports columnists. 
</P>
<P>
He is the only three-time recipient of the National Headliners Club award for 
"consistently outstanding columns." He also won an Eclipse Award in 1987 for 
coverage of thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Pope was a perfect choice," said Dave Smith, executive sports editor of the 
Dallas Morning News and chairman of the award selection committee, which 
consists of 13 past presidents of APSE. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, Pope became the youngest sports editor of any daily newspaper with the 
Athens, Ga., Banner-Herald. He worked for United Press International and the 
Atlanta Constitution before being named executive sports editor of the Atlanta 
Journal at 26. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Miami Herald in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
He has covered almost every major sports events, including all 23 Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Red Smith, who died in 1982, was the first winner of the award. Since then, 
winners have been: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Murray of The Los Angeles Times; Shirley Povich of the Washington Post; 
Fred Russell of the Nashville Banner; Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas Morning 
News; Si Burick of the Dayton Daily News; Will Grimsley of the Associated 
Press, and Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.

ARCADIA INVITATIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
GIRL SPRINTERS STEAL SHOW WITH A SPLIT OF RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle between two of the top girl prep sprinters in the nation ended in a 
draw at the 22nd Arcadia Invitational track and field meet Saturday night, as 
Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir and Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa shared 
sprint victories. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a junior and the daughter of former USC sprinter and Olympic medalist 
Dr. Lennox Miller, won their first race, defeating Burnham in the 100 meters, 
11.59 seconds to 11.64. 
</P>
<P>
It was Miller's second consecutive victory over Burnham this season after 
constantly losing to the Rio Mesa senior last season. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham held a slight lead coming out of the blocks before Miller pulled even 
at 50 meters. Miller then pulled away for a three-meter win. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, who was the national female prep track athlete of the year last 
season, took the defeat in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran the race I thought I would run," said Burnham. "I have been working on 
the mental state of my running. I knew that this was going to be my most 
difficult season ever." 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long for Burnham to even the score when she and Miller squared 
off in the 200 an hour and a half later. 
</P>
<P>
In a replay of their earlier race, Miller started out quickly and moved to an 
early lead off the turn. Burnham answered the challenge, catching Miller with 
50 meters remaining. However, unlike the 100, Burnham proved to be the 
strongest, running 23.63 to Miller's 23.91. It was the second fastest girls 200 
in the nation this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely did not expect to run this fast this early in the season," 
Burnham said. "I had been training for the 400 all year and did not even expect 
to break 24." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said she expected Miller to be ahead early because of their previous 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a complete reversal from last season," said Burnham. "Last year, I would 
catch her all of the time at the finish but she has gotten stronger. I 
anticipated this to be tough because it is not written down that I have to win 
every race." 
</P>
<P>
After the 200, Miller, who has a history of leg tightness, limped noticeably 
across the infield. 
</P>
<P>
"My right leg is really tight," she said. "I tightened up at the end." 
</P>
<P>
The Burnham-Miller battle was just one of the highlights of an evening of fine 
performances that saw five meet records broken and 17 national bests. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne boys' relay teams ran away with two victories in the 400 and 
1,600. Senior Curtis Conway, who is headed to USC on a football scholarship, 
anchored both teams. The times were 40.71 and 3:17.14, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Ransom of Denver Montebello set a meet record with a time of 46.57, the 
fastest in the nation this season. Steve Lewis, the 1988 Olympic 400-meter gold 
medalist, previously held the record of 46.70 set while running for American 
Fremont in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom, running in lane five, started quickly, making up the staggered start 
off of the first turn, then drawing out to a five-meter lead. With 100 meters 
left, he stretched his lead to 15 meters before tightening, finishing seven 
meters ahead of Beno Bryant of L.A. Dorsey, who ran 47.35. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out fast like I usually do," Ransom said. "I knew I had a big lead 
when I came off the last turn, but I started to tighten up as I heard the crowd 
cheering. I thought that someone was catching me." 
</P>
<P>
Ransom, who also finished second in the 100 with a time of 10.66, said that he 
expected more competition in his specialty race. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win the 100, but things did not work out," said Ransom, who is 
being recruited by USC, Texas A&amp;M and Tennessee. "I used it as a warmup for 
the 400, because I thought that there would be a lot of competition in that 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Other meet highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jeff Laynes of Oakland ran the fastest 100 meters in the nation this 
season, winning in a time of 10.56. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barry Smith of San Francisco Mission ran the nation's quickest 200 meters, 
defeating Erik Mitchell of Mayfair Lakewood and Laynes with a time of 21.34. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jayson Lavender of Wichita Falls, Tex., set a meet record in the pole vault 
with 17 feet 3 1/4 inches, the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dion Bently of Pittsburgh Penn Hills, the national indoor long jump 
record-holder, set a meet record with a leap of 25-3.

The hiring of an equine medical director to coordinate drug use and drug 
testing for race horses in California was unanimously approved by a 12-member 
commission of racing industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be presented to the medical commission of the California 
Horse Racing Board meeting Monday at Arcadia City Hall, site of Saturday's 2 
1/2 hour session. 
</P>
<P>
Racing board Chairman Leslie Liscom appointed the 12 racing leaders on March 
23. The purpose of Saturday's meeting was to address what Liscom called "a 
problem of integrity" in California horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
Six trainers have been linked to cocaine-positive tests in horses and more than 
100 urine samples have been reported as possibly containing one or more illegal 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
Several potential candidates for the equine medical director's position will be 
announced at Monday's meeting.

UNDER THE MICROSCOPE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO SCOUTS' EYES ARE ON LEUZINGER HURLER TYRONE SCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tyrone Scott was about to walk under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with radar guns and stopwatches, an eager gathering of major league 
scouts waited behind the Leuzinger High backstop for the 17-year-old pitcher to 
take the mound Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They were there to see if Scott, a hard-throwing left-hander who leads the 
South Bay in strikeouts, has what it takes to play professional baseball. With 
the free-agent draft in June, every prospect is getting a long, hard look. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the scouts, Paul Fryer of the Baltimore Orioles, has seen Scott 
pitch before. He liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"He has everything you look for in a pitcher," Fryer said. "He's fluid, he's 
got a live arm and he's an athlete. I think somebody will draft him." 
</P>
<P>
Scott would like to impress the scouts on this unseasonably hot afternoon. His 
dream is to play in the major leagues, despite the fact he also seems to have 
potential as a football player. He was an All-Southern Section defensive back 
for Leuzinger last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Football was just something to stall time until baseball," he said. "I want to 
make my living playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's performance against visiting Rolling Hills ranges from exceptional to 
abysmal. He impresses by pitching a one-hitter with 12 strikeouts. But his 
seven walks and two wild pitches open the door for a 2-1 Rolling Hills win. 
</P>
<P>
For Scott, it isn't the first time he has been his own worst enemy. 
</P>
<P>
His prep baseball career almost didn't get off the ground because of grade 
problems. He was ruled academically ineligible as a freshman and sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hanging out with the wrong people," he said. "I wasn't doing my 
homework. I wasn't going to class. Then I realized that this is my sport and 
this is what I want to play, so I had to do a job in the classroom. I got my 
grades up, and I've been playing ever since." 
</P>
<P>
That was good news for Derrel Thomas, the ex-Dodger who became Leuzinger's 
coach last season. He says Scott is the glue that holds together an Olympian 
team that has struggled offensively in recent games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told the team that when Tyrone is pitching, just get him one run," he 
said. "If he's on, that's all we need." 
</P>
<P>
While that might be an exaggeration, it's not far from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (4-2) has allowed only four earned runs in 38 innings pitched this 
season, good for a stellar 0.74 ERA. His 66 strikeouts put him in a class by 
himself among South Bay pitchers. In his last three games against Capistrano 
Valley, Inglewood and Rolling Hills, he has 42 strikeouts in 21 innings. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, Scott has been wild. His 37 walks lead the area. 
</P>
<P>
That statistic makes the 6-2, 170-pound senior one of the most generous 
pitchers in Southern California, especially when one considers that he has 
allowed nearly four times as many base runners on walks than he has on hits 
(10). 
</P>
<P>
Why is he such an enigma? 
</P>
<P>
Those close to Scott give two reasons: He lacks the proper pitching 
instruction, and he doesn't utilize all of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who played every position but pitcher during his 15-year major league 
career, says Scott is blessed with so much natural talent that the senior fails 
to work as hard as he should. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't exert a lot of effort," Thomas said. "He does things so naturally. 
That can be good, but it also can be bad. Some guys do things so nonchalant 
that they miss out on a lot of their own talent. 
</P>
<P>
"If Tyrone was a Pete Rose, a Charlie Hustle type of player, there's no telling 
what he could do. There's no telling how fast he is because he just glides. He 
doesn't put all out." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Scott: "I have to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas wishes his ace was more like Tom Gordon, Leuzinger's stubby third 
baseman. An overachiever, Gordon earned a starting spot on the varsity team and 
became the No. 3 hitter in the lineup through perseverance, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Gordon is an inspiration for Tyrone," the coach said. "He's the type of 
player who's always fired up and always looking to improve. I wish Tyrone could 
get as fired up as Tommy. Then he would be very impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Tyrone realizes his potential. If he did, he would apply himself 
a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who is black, and Gordon, who is white, are closer than most high school 
teammates. They are also roommates. 
</P>
<P>
Scott had been living with an aunt in the Windsor Hills area of South Los 
Angeles before moving in with the Gordon family in their Lawndale apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's friendship, that's all it is," Gordon said. "We offered and he came to 
live with us." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon says Scott provides a source of confidence for Leuzinger, which is tied 
for third place in the eight-team Bay League with a 2-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
"When Tyrone is on the mound, we know he's not going to give up more than two 
runs," he said. "We don't even have to worry about playing defense. It's either 
a strikeout or a pop fly. We just worry about working with the bats." 
</P>
<P>
Serra baseball Coach Darren Fleming, a scout for the Kansas City Royals, said 
it's almost a certainty that Scott will be drafted in one of the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll go very high," Fleming said. "There is a shortage of quality (high 
school) pitchers right now, especially left-handers who throw hard. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an outstanding arm and good physical ability. He just lacks the proper 
coaching in pitching. That's what's holding him back. Right now he's just 
playing on what he knows." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's strengths are an 80-mph-plus fastball and an outstanding curve ball. 
With improved mechanics, those pitches would be even more devastating, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a pitching coach," he said, "I'm sure he would be a much better 
pitcher than he is right now. But I have to concentrate on 16 other kids, too." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's talents aren't limited to pitching. He bats cleanup and plays center 
field in between starts. Thursday he raised his average to .474 (9 for 19) by 
going 3 for 3 with a bases-loaded triple in Leuzinger's 7-3 win over Rolling 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But his future in baseball depends on his left arm. Thomas noticed it the first 
time he saw Scott practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him throw from the outfield and I couldn't believe it," he said. "He had 
such an excellent arm. Once you've been involved in baseball for a number of 
years, you tend to notice things about players. You're able to recognize 
talent. . . . Tyrone has a certain amount of ability that no one can touch." 
</P>
<P>
Scott used his ability last season to emerge as one of the South Bay's top 
pitchers. Because he had been ineligible his first two years, he was virtually 
unknown when he began his junior year. But that quickly changed with a series 
of impressive outings. 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the powerful Redondo and El Segundo teams in the Pioneer 
League, Leuzinger managed to hold its own when Scott pitched. He struck out 10 
in a 2-0 loss to Redondo and fanned nine in a 3-2 defeat to El Segundo. Another 
fine effort was squandered by the Olympians in a 1-0 playoff loss to Fullerton 
as Scott finished the year with a misleading 3-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
Although he lost, Scott says those performances fueled his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I surprised myself," he said. "I didn't know if I could hold down teams like 
Redondo and El Segundo. But I did." 
</P>
<P>
Scott has a higher set of goals this season. In order, he wants to win the 
league title, capture the Southern Section 5-A Division championship and sign a 
professional contract this summer. The pinnacle would be to eventually play for 
a major league club. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is a crap shoot. But Thomas says Scott is capable of going far 
in baseball with the right attitude. Twenty years ago, Thomas was the No. 1 
draft pick of the Houston Astros out of Dorsey High in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyrone reminds me a lot of myself when I was in school," he said. "I wanted to 
play major league baseball, but I was aware of what needed to be done for that 
to happen. If Tyrone would apply himself the same way I did, there's no telling 
what he could accomplish. He still has the idea that it only takes so much to 
do what is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, when informed of his coach's assessment, silently reacted to the 
criticism by shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody said life under a microscope would be easy.

DIFFERENT LEAGUE, SAME STORY: EL SEGUNDO FEASTS ON IMBALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last season the Pioneer League included two of the Southland's best prep 
baseball teams (Redondo and El Segundo) and two of the worst (Morningside and 
Centennial). The imbalance of power made for some terribly lopsided scores. 
</P>
<P>
Because of realignment, the Pioneer League was scrapped and the schools were 
placed in various leagues. But the situation hasn't changed for El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, now grouped with Catholic schools in the Camino Real League, are 
playing an even more inequitable schedule than last year, based on their scores 
of the past week. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo set a school record Wednesday for most runs scored in a game with a 
27-2 rout over Verbum Dei, and followed it Friday night with a 24-0 shutout 
over Pius X. The two-game total: Eagles 51, opponents 2. 
</P>
<P>
The imbalance of power could be seen in the Camino Real League standings 
entering Saturday's games. The top five teams -- St. Bernard, Serra, El 
Segundo, St. Anthony and Bosco Tech -- had a combined record of 12-3. The 
bottom three teams -- Verbum Dei, St. Monica and Pius X -- were a collective 
0-9. 
</P>
<P>
And the bottom three aren't just losing. They're losing big. Serra routed St. 
Monica, 18-5, Wednesday and earlier this season blanked Pius X, 11-0, behind a 
no-hitter from Jeff Hazelitt, not known as an overpowering pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the bottom three teams has been a boon for other players as well. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Melendez, St. Bernard's star pitcher and hitter, had a field day in an 8-1 
win over Pius X on Wednesday. The left-hander pitched five innings for the 
victory and helped himself at the plate with two home runs and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, El Segundo sophomore pitcher Brett Newell looked as good as any 
player in the league. The son of El Segundo football Coach Steve Newell threw a 
four-hit shutout and went 4 for 5 with four RBIs against Pius X. 
</P>
<P>
Things continued to go bad for North Torrance's baseball team. The Saxons, who 
had hoped to turn their season around in the Ocean League, paid the price for 
shoddy defense this week in error-plagued losses to Redondo, 8-5, and Mira 
Costa, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the favorites for the Ocean title before the season, North 
dropped to 1-3 in league play and 3-8-1 overall as its losing streak reached 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, on the other hand, has to be considered the surprise of the year. 
The Mustangs, rated fifth in a pre-season coaches' poll, are tied for first 
place with Culver City at 4-0 (8-3 overall) under first-year Coach Jim 
Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
All four of Mira Costa's league wins have come in its last at-bat. Jason Garner 
delivered the game-winning hit Friday against North with a two-out double to 
score Andy Owens. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs hope to be playing for the league lead when they travel to Culver 
City for a 3 p.m. game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As for North, the Saxons have an uphill battle to make the Southern Section 5-A 
playoffs. There are five teams ahead of them in the Ocean standings. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo (3-1) fell from the ranks of the unbeaten in the Ocean League with a 
surprising 13-0 loss to West Torrance. The Warriors (2-2), winning for only the 
third time in 12 games, roughed up Redondo pitchers for 12 hits, including a 
grand slam by John Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont says one his first projects at Mira Costa is to improve the school's 
baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
"The facility needs to be upgraded," he said. "It's not an easy thing to do 
financially and time-wise, but we're trying to fix up the field to be a 
first-rate place to play." 
</P>
<P>
The batting cages have been upgraded and Beaumont said he is working on getting 
a permanent fence built in the outfield and smoothing the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont said his efforts have been supported by Athletic Director Herb 
Hinsche, who is also working with first-year football Coach Dave Brown and 
first-year basketball Coach Glenn Marx in helping revamp facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills basketball star John Hardy, the two-time Bay League MVP, is still 
waiting to see if a four-year college will offer him a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to get calls, but you can't tell if they're serious until they 
offer you a trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, a 6-4 senior who figures to play either small forward or off guard in 
college, scored 13 points Friday night as his team of Southern Section 
all-stars lost to a team of L.A. City standouts at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is the first day of the spring signing period. The area's top 
recruits -- Ed Stokes of St. Bernard (Arizona), Zan Mason of Westchester (UCLA) 
and Harold Miner of Inglewood (USC) -- signed early in November. 
</P>
<P>
While the Camino Real League is wracked with disparity, the Bay League boasts 
the South Bay's most balanced baseball race. 
</P>
<P>
One game separates the top six teams. Rolling Hills and Hawthorne are tied for 
first place with 3-1 records and four teams -- Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, 
Leuzinger and Santa Monica -- are deadlocked in third with 2-2 marks. 
</P>
<P>
In pivotal games this week, Hawthorne visits Santa Monica and Leuzinger travels 
to Beverly Hills on Tuesday. The teams switch sites for Thursday's rematches.

COUNTY'S CHOICE OF MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surprised, amazed, dumbfounded, shocked and annoyed are just a few of my 
reactions to the county board's "unanimous" selection of McDonald's as the 
fast-food concessionaire for the new airport facility ("Ronald McDonald Beats 
Out Carl's Jr. for Airport Space," March 29). I thought that we deserved 
better, much better! The best that can be said about McDonald's is that they 
are consistent: consistently bland and unimaginative with a limited menu that 
hasn't changed appreciably in years. McDonald's has continually promoted their 
limited menu with heavy advertising and hype aimed at the very young. All hype 
and nothing new just about sums up McDonald's marketing approach. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of a large group of "full-fare" business travelers already paying a 
premium to fly in and out of John Wayne Airport, I was expecting a much better 
fast-food restaurant such as Carl's Jr. Certainly an Orange County-based 
concessionaire with a much more diverse menu, offering higher quality 
selections would have been a better choice. 
</P>
<P>
I certainly hope that the Orange County Board of Supervisors reconsiders its 
decision on this matter. At the very least, please offer us a choice by 
splitting the fast-food concession between McDonald's and Carl's Jr.

HOW TO TRAVEL WITH CHILDREN AND ENJOY THE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM UPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As any parent knows, traveling on airplanes with children can be a humbling 
experience. But it's also not without its rewards. Travel can help expand your 
child's mind and enhance his or her life. 
</P>
<P>
But first you have to get there. Here is some advice on enhancing your travel 
experience with children. 
</P>
<P>
When accompanied by an adult, children under 2 years fly free on most domestic 
airlines. But they must be placed in your lap unless empty seats are available. 
From ages 2 through 11, children accompanied by an adult are entitled to a 
discount. Check fares with individual airlines. 
</P>
<P>
When making reservations, request bulkhead seating for the extra space it 
provides. Your own government-certified child-safety seat may be used aboard an 
aircraft, but you'll have to buy a full-fare seat to use it. 
</P>
<P>
If notified at least 24 hours in advance, most airlines offer children special 
meals such as peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, hot dogs and spaghetti. 
Airlines don't stock baby food, so take along your own, as well as emergency 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
Pack the child's favorite toy, plus a surprise pack that includes such things 
as books and crayons. Don't pack games with lots of pieces that can get lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pamphlet Offers Tips 
</P>
<P>
A free pamphlet, "When Kids Fly," published by Massport -- the agency that 
manages Boston's Logan Airport -- details parental responsibility as well as 
the obligations of an airline carrying an unaccompanied child. 
</P>
<P>
The guide cautions parents to anticipate problems such as missed connections, 
canceled flights and late departures, which might cause a child to miss the 
adult picking him up at his or her destination. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet warns parents not to think of teen-agers traveling alone as 
adults. Although they may look mature they may not be able to handle all 
emergencies. And they may avoid asking questions because appearing "cool" is 
important to them. 
</P>
<P>
Many airlines will not allow children under 5 to fly by themselves. Five- to 
7-year-old children can fly solo on most airlines if no change of plane is 
required. But a responsible adult must remain with the child until he or she is 
boarded, and the child must be met by an adult with adequate identification, 
such as a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Children 8 through 11 generally will be allowed to travel by themselves, even 
if a change of plane is required. Most airlines will assist the child in making 
the plane change, although some charge a fee for the service. 
</P>
<P>
A few airlines, including Continental, have children's club rooms in some major 
airports. The club rooms are places where the children can be entertained with 
games while waiting for the next flight. There may be a fee for use. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines may require that you check in your child at the departure gate at 
least 30 minutes before a flight. They also may require that you fill out a 
form waiving them of responsibility for everything except transporting your 
child. Check airline policy when booking the flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Precautions 
</P>
<P>
Other advice: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stay where you can be reached until your child safely reaches his or her 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give your child a piece of paper listing your name, his home address, the 
address of his destination, the name of the adult meeting him at the airport 
and several phone numbers to call in an emergency. Make sure people will be at 
those numbers to take a call during travel time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the child is old enough, instruct him or her on how to call home 
collect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In case of emergency or confusion, tell your child to seek help from a 
uniformed attendant or desk agent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Impress upon the child that he or she should not leave the airport with a 
stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tell teen-agers making flight changes to pay attention to schedules. They 
may have a tendency to become distracted. 
</P>

Parents planning vacations with children may benefit from some of the 
activities scheduled specifically with children in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Family travel authority Carole Terwillinger Meyers and her husband Gene operate 
a mail-order business that sends out a catalogue, "Family Travel Guides," to 
help parents plan family vacations. Their new catalogue offers more than 200 
family-oriented travel guides, game books and related articles. "They're the 
best of the lot," says Carole Meyers, who reviewed and selected them. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-page catalogue of recommended guidebooks is available by sending $1 for 
postage and handling to Carousel Press, Family Travel Guides, P.O. Box 6061, 
Albany, Calif. 94706. Well worth a buck. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"Rascals in Paradise" organizes group tours for three to six families with a 
heavy emphasis on learning opportunities for children. Escorts are certified 
teachers, when possible. There's a heavy emphasis on beach vacations (Caribbean 
and South Pacific), but tours also cover Africa, Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This program stresses separate children's activities, allowing the adult 
participants plenty of time to pursue their own interests. For more 
information, contact Adventure Express, 185 Berry St., Suite 5503, San 
Francisco 94107, toll-free (800) 443-0799.

OUTDOOR MUSEUM RELIVES THE SETTLING OF INDIANA

Rated "one of the 10 best places to relive America's past" by Good Housekeeping 
magazine, along with such landmarks as Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts 
and Michigan's Greenfield Village, Conner Prairie recreates the primitive 
atmosphere of 1836 Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Just six miles northeast of Indianapolis, Conner Prairie, an outdoor history 
museum, depicts the common endeavors of the first generation of Indiana 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
Costumed guides reflect the mannerisms, attitudes and values of the day in 
first-person interpretations, portraying former villagers. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by bolts of calico, buttons and thread, nails and implements, a 
youthful James Whitaker, the storekeeper's son, says, "I can't help the high 
price of coffee -- 20 cents a pound." 
</P>
<P>
He tells a customer: "This tea service, imported from England, is of fine bone 
china. It'll run you $6.50. That's expensive. Don't reckon I'll sell much of 
them. When I purchased the dishes at a Cincinnati jobber's, my father warned me 
not to waste money on frivolities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practical Pottery 
</P>
<P>
At the edge of town, Isaac Baker and his bride run the pottery store that 
supplies the village with practical items such as pitchers and covered jars. He 
considers his cabin "a real fine house. It has a wood floor. Lucinda here is 
used to a dirt floor." 
</P>
<P>
Stationed before an open hearth, a housewife dressed in typical 1830s attire 
brushes away flies as she prepares dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much you can do about all these flies," she says. "They do fine by 
themselves. Indeed it's hot, but if I don't have a fire, I don't get to cook. 
You gotta cook if you want to eat, and my boys work hard and sure do get 
hungry." 
</P>
<P>
At the Golden Eagle Inn, a bed is 12 1/2 cents a night, meals are 25 cents, 
room and board $2 a week. There, travelers exchange news about faraway places, 
while the aroma of freshly baked gingerbread and mincemeat pies wafts through 
the kitchen doorway. 
</P>
<P>
A guest, glad to rest a spell, shakes his head in dismay, complaining: "There's 
no more state land nearby and privately owned land is going for $5 an acre." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pegs and Timbers 
</P>
<P>
The bar, which smells like a barn, originally was erected in Clifton County, 
Ind., in 1832. It was dismantled, brought to Conner Prairie and reconstructed 
with wooden pegs to fasten the huge timbers. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, Doc Campbell, who compounds his own medicine, allows that for 
occasional surgery he uses whiskey for the men and opium tea for the women. 
"Then I just hold them down till it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
For the decorating of Campbell's residence -- there's a grand piano in the 
parlor -- research preceded what might appear to be an arbitrary decision. 
Paint for the rooms was based on colors advertised in Indianapolis newspapers 
during the 1830s. Wallpaper also reflects the period. 
</P>
<P>
Encompassing 288 acres -- including a wooded area, the White River, a prairie, 
a natural amphitheater and a nature trail -- Conner Prairie was founded in 1964 
by the late Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical heir who donated the William Conner 
home and surrounding farmland to Earlham, a liberal-arts college in Richmond, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Authentic Furnishings 
</P>
<P>
Prairietown, Conner Prairie's 19th-Century village, consists of 39 structures 
moved from former Indiana sites. The mansion of William Conner, a prominent 
frontiersman, land owner, trader and member of the Indiana Legislature who came 
from Ohio in the early 1800s, also was moved to Conner Prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Built on its present foundation in 1823, the home -- listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places -- is furnished authentically, including Conner's 
game table, his horsehair sofa and his chairs. 
</P>
<P>
On the stairway landing stands an imposing grandfather clock, circa 1830. 
According to the guide: "It keeps good time, is set once a week, on Monday." A 
delicate sampler, cross-stitched by Martha E. Rust in 1822, hangs in the 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 100 years old, the bright applique quilt in the master bedroom looks as 
if it had just been completed. The trundle bed, too, is spread with an 
outstanding quilt, a bold floral design on a gleaming white background, made in 
1850. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wool From the Herd 
</P>
<P>
On the Conner estate are three buildings brought here to show what may have 
existed on Conner property. The Loom House displays textile arts. Woven bed 
ticking, woolen rugs and fancy coverlets are fashioned there for the entire 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors watching the fabric being woven can look out the window at the plant 
that colored the yarn and see the sheep that produced the wool. 
</P>
<P>
Down a path, the Spring House, a stone reservoir with walls, is perfect for 
storing perishables and stays cool even during hot summer days. 
</P>
<P>
At the Still, several yards beyond, spectators can see the process by which 
early settlers distilled corn into whiskey. One bushel of corn could be 
converted into three gallons of corn liquor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gallery for Exhibits 
</P>
<P>
The newly opened $9-million Museum Center, with an exterior of Indiana 
rubblestone and a bright copper roof, offers exhibits in a 3,000-square-foot 
gallery. The current exhibit, a series of sketches called "Drawn to Indiana," 
will run through July 17. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a central gallery for permanent exhibitions, the center includes 
a 100-seat theater, 3,000-volume research library, sky-lit atrium, classrooms 
and studios for blacksmiths, potters, woodworkers and restorers. 
</P>
<P>
On the calendar are year-round special programs: Conner Prairie by candlelight 
(during Christmas season), winter hearthside suppers in front of the dining 
room fireplace at the Conner home (January through March), a Mother's Day 
fashion show featuring traditional 19th-Century costumes, and a hot-air balloon 
festival (May 27). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old-Fashioned Sport 
</P>
<P>
Festivities for the Fourth of July, as celebrated in 1836 when the only 
national holiday was Independence Day, are full of old-fashioned sport: 
political orations, pie-eating and seed-spitting contests, checkers 
championships, sack races, brass band, barbershop quartet and a fireworks 
display. 
</P>
<P>
On selected weekends, demonstrations of folk art and needlework, plus an 
old-time spelling bee with words taken from Noah Webster's 1831 speller 
highlight aspects of pioneer days. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, the Indianapolis Symphony performs concerts on Wednesday and 
Saturday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Conner Prairie, six miles north of Interstate 465 at the Allisonville Road 
exit, is open April through November, Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m.; noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday, closed Tuesdays in April and November.

ANN ARBOR WARMS UP AFTER BIG CHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

in Ann Arbor.

<P>
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When film director Lawrence Kasdan chose the title "The Big Chill" for his 1983 
movie about the reunion of old pals from the 1960s, he must have been thinking 
about the frigid winters he spent here, as a student on the University of 
Michigan campus. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Big Chill does not last forever . . . except on the silver 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
Once the summer weather arrives, Ann Arbor emerges from its winter doldrums and 
blossoms into a warm, wonderful, walkable city with lively outdoor cafes, 
pleasant tree-shaded parks and a pseudo-Ivy League atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is only 45 miles west of Detroit along I-94, Ann Arbor prides 
itself on maintaining a totally separate identity. 
</P>
<P>
The 165-year-old city is an intellectual never-never land, where the pizza 
delivery drivers have Ph.D.s and even the residential street corners, notably 
Nixon-Bluett, have political overtones. 
</P>
<P>
But politics, along with everything else, took a back seat last week as the 
city and campus community celebrated en masse Michigan's first-ever NCAA 
basketball championship, an 80-79 overtime victory over Seton Hall Monday night 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
True, the action on central campus slows down considerably once the 
university's nearly 36,000 students pack up their PCs, LPs and CDs and head for 
home. 
</P>
<P>
But year-round residents (called "townies") view the break from the Go Blue! 
hoopla of the students (called "gownies") as a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
For visitors, the pause provides a perfect opportunity to enjoy Ann Arbor at 
its very best, the one time in the whole year when it is possible to find a 
vacant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who is visiting Ann Arbor for the first time should plan to spend at 
least a morning, if not an entire day, strolling around central campus. Maps 
are available at the information desk in the Michigan Union at the corner of 
State and South University, and at bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's easy to find your way around if you keep in mind that the core of 
central campus is a block-square area called the Diagonal (or Diag, for short), 
which is bounded by State, North University, East University and South 
University. Everything else more or less revolves around it. 
</P>
<P>
In the halcyon days of student protests, the Diag was often the stage for 
Vietnam protests and Black Action Movement rallies. But nowadays during summer 
break, students are more likely to be hurling Frisbees than diatribes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colorful Figures 
</P>
<P>
If you time it right you may even catch Dr. Diag, one of the many colorful 
figures on campus, delivering an impromptu soliloquy on some obscure subject 
from his stone bench podium. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with its reputation as the "Harvard of the Midwest," the university 
has several interesting museums that are open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Alexander G. Ruthven Exhibit Museums complex is guaranteed to be a hit with 
kids, who will enjoy seeing the 15-foot allosaurus (dinosaur) skeleton on the 
second floor and the twinkling constellation show in the planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
The Kelsey Museum is best remembered for its display of Egyptian mummies, and 
the Museum of Art is notable for its compact but fairly eclectic collection of 
paintings and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Several landmarks may be of interest to visitors. A bronze plaque on the 
Michigan Union denotes the historic moment in 1960 when then-President John F. 
Kennedy stood on the front steps and announced the formation of the Peace 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection of South and East University is also noteworthy. It is known 
as McDivitt-White corner, honoring two American astronauts, James A. McDivitt 
and Edward White, who were Michigan graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to walk through the Engine Arch of the old Engineering College building 
on the northwest corner of the intersection. In bygone days when the university 
enforced a 10 p.m. curfew, it was said to be the goal of every co-ed to kiss 
her sweetheart under the Engine Arch at the stroke of midnight . . . without 
getting caught sneaking back into her dorm. 
</P>
<P>
If your feet get hot you can always stop for a pizza and beer, served out of a 
Kerr jar, at Dominick's, a popular outdoor cafe across the street from the Law 
Quadrangle. 
</P>
<P>
The Law Quad, built between 1923 and 1933, lends an Ivy League atmosphere to 
the campus, with its Gothic spires and leaded-glass windows. Its shaded inner 
courtyard is straight out of "Love Story." 
</P>
<P>
Drake's Sandwich Shop, with its familiar red-and-white-striped awning, is 
another throwback to the 1920s. Inside you'll find an old-fashioned soda 
fountain that serves Boston coolers, along with rows and rows of glass candy 
jars. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Ann Arbor's newest and fastest-growing attraction, Domino's Farms, 
has no connection with the university. 
</P>
<P>
The $250-million complex, northeast of the city on a 300-acre site off Plymouth 
Road, serves as the world headquarters for Domino's Pizza Inc., and as a 
showcase for millionaire owner Thomas S. Monaghan's treasured collections. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan, an avid admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright, has selected Wright's early 
Prairie style architecture for his corporate buildings, and has established a 
Frank Lloyd Wright Museum to house the world's largest collection of Wright's 
works, valued at more than $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the exhibition building is the Domino's Pizza Classic Car Museum, where 
visitors can stroll among 100 of the classiest antique cars assembled under one 
roof. The prize in the collection is the Bugatti Royale, which is only one of 
six made and was the personal car of Ettore Bugatti. Monaghan shelled out $8.1 
million for it -- the highest price ever paid for an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the summer Domino's hosts a series of arts and crafts festivals, 
kite-flying competitions and other family-oriented events. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing can compare, however, with the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, which has 
been a traditional rite of summer for several decades. 
</P>
<P>
What started in 1960 as a few artists displaying their wares between roped-off 
parking meters on South University, has grown into a four-day extravaganza that 
literally engulfs the entire city. This year the fair will be held July 19-22. 
</P>
<P>
It is really three art fairs wrapped up in one; the unending expanse of 
hand-thrown pots, abstract oil paintings, blown-glass vases and woven wall 
hangings extends from central campus all the way downtown to Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Ann Arbor Summer Festival, scheduled for June 24 to July 16 this year, 
features performances by theater groups, musicians and vocalists. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about Ann Arbor, however, is that when you get tired of it you 
can simply pack up a picnic and head for a nearby lake or river. Gallup Park 
offers paddle boat, canoe and bike rentals for an enjoyable afternoon on the 
Huron River. The city sponsors a Huron River Day (July 9), with lots of family 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Arboretum (known as "the Arb"), which grows more than 50 species of plants, 
is a favorite place for hiking and communing with nature. 
</P>
<P>
When the sun sets, Ann Arbor once again becomes the center of action. During 
the summer months, restaurants such as the Full Moon Cafe, Gratzi and the Real 
Seafood Company serve food and spirits at outdoor tables on Main Street, a la 
Rome's Via Veneto. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny day you may even see the legendary Shakey Jake, Ann Arbor's prince 
of street people, passing by decked out in his Panama hat, white suit and 
two-toned shoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bygone Era 
</P>
<P>
One of Ann Arbor's most famous restaurants is the Gandy Dancer, which occupies 
the city's historic old railroad station. Lanterns, photos of old steam engines 
and an antique wrought-iron sign recreate the nostalgia of a bygone era when 
trains were king of the road. 
</P>
<P>
If you want something funky in food, stop in at the Fleetwood Diner, which is 
housed in an old trailer, or the Del Rio, which has a long oak bar and 
stained-window accents. 
</P>
<P>
For a few more lire you can enjoy an Italian dinner at the Bella Ciao, a cozy 
trattoria, or a French meal at Escoffier, which has a more formal Parisian air. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner you'll find cool jazz at the Bird of Paradise Jazz Club, down-home 
country and bluegrass music at the Ark, classical strains at the Kerrytown 
Concert House, vintage movies at the Michigan Theater and live comedy at the 
Mainstreet Comedy Showcase. 
</P>
<P>
Watering holes such as the Old Town Bar have also been an integral part of the 
city since 1872, when it was duly noted that Ann Arbor had eight hotels, five 
druggists, five billiards halls . . . and 49 saloons.

Since Yellowstone National Park opened in 1872, the national park system has 
grown to a collection of scenic and historic areas that includes about 50 
national parks and 156 national forests.

The parks and forests peppered across the nation make excellent vacation 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the parks have accommodations as varied as the parks themselves, from 
modest campsites to handsome hotels and lodges. Contact the individual parks 
for more information on peak times to visit, the need for reservations, and 
costs.

The Utah Arts Festival, an outdoor celebration in Salt Lake City from June 21 
to 25, enables visitors to see and buy some handcrafts from across the country. 
Held downtown in the Triad Center, the event is a showcase for about 70 top 
artisans and crafts people. 
</P>
<P>
The Triad Center is about a block from the Doubletree Hotel, where many of the 
artists stay. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most interesting offerings are works by the following: 
</P>
<P>
Rick and Brigid Anderson (from Arizona) produce tiny hand-tied, hand-dyed 
macrame earrings ($12 and up), some of which contain shining crystals or gold 
and silver strands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wind Instruments 
</P>
<P>
Michael Graham Allen (from Oklahoma) makes four types of wind instruments ($60 
to $125), including sweet-sounding flutes and easy-to-play pan pipes ($40) with 
two-octave G-minor pentatonic scales, modeled after instruments played by 
Andean Indians in South America. Under the Coyote Oldman Music label, he also 
produces cassette tapes ($10) of flute music. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Mehan (from Salt Lake City) is a sculptor whose ceramic coyotes (around 
$150) are dressed as people and perform human activities. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Patricia Goodspeed (from Arkansas) are leather workers who create 
handsome suede shirts patterned with varicolored earth-tone stripes and lines 
with lamb suede (about $300), as well as suede scarfs ($45) and small pouches 
($25) that attach to ranger belts ($30). 
</P>
<P>
Kolene Kumpfer (from Salt Lake City) weaves delicate baskets out of straw and 
twigs, fills them with subtly colored dried flowers and wires them so they may 
be used as wall decorations ($35 to $40). 
</P>
<P>
Californian Michael Kelly's contemporary furniture handcrafted of hardwood has 
a sculptural look. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces include rockerlike bentwood chairs and coordinating work tables, as well 
as roll-top desks ($2,500) that have numerous drawers and hidden cubbyholes and 
are painted a brilliant yellow and other bright colors. Also file boxes with 
sliding tops ($50), tape dispensers ($22), compact-disc holders ($42) and 
cassette holders ($20). 
</P>
<P>
Michael Thiele (from Arizona) sculpts musical instruments out of hardwoods, 
including rosewood, walnut and teak. He has adapted Aztec designs to create 
drums ($60 to $325) with harmonic tunings. 
</P>
<P>
Jeweler Stuart Porteous (from Washington) uses pieces of agate and jasper and 
stones yielded from small, independent digs in the Northwest, set in silver 
($40 to $100) and gold ($300 and up) to create pins and pendants. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Kirkpatrick (from Arizona) is a jeweler, etcher and sculptor who works 
with copper, bronze, silver and gold. He calls his work South American Lizzard 
Research and uses lizards as a source for many decorative objects, including 
belt buckles ($150 to $175). Kirkpatrick also makes silver and bronze earrings 
shaped like lotus flowers ($50) and pins that look like futuristic bugs from 
outer space ($25). 
</P>
<P>
Briant Matheson (from Salt Lake City) is a mixed-media man who uses ceramics, 
metals, paper and other materials to create decorative home and personal 
accessories shaped like fish -- fish as bolo ties (about $45), fish as toys and 
mobiles ($20 and up) and large collectible papier-mache fish ($100 and up) that 
have no function other than to be beautiful and amusing. 
</P>
<P>
June Rettig (from Arizona) makes custom-designed leather shoes (from about $250 
and up), many of which are shaped like native American moccasins and 
hand-colored with geometric patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Richards (from Utah) is the creator of wooden toys, including parrots and 
clowns ($25 and up), and pull cars and trains ($30 and up) hand-painted with 
original cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Ellison and William Fickinger (from Arizona) hand-paint one-of-a-kind 
T-shirts ($20). 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Henrie (from Salt Lake City) produces colored clothing, including 
stylish pedal pushers ($36), flowing full circle skirts ($32) and tank-top 
T-shirts ($19) out of tie-dyed cotton cloth. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the show and sell stalls the festival organizes fine art 
exhibitions in other venues, large environmental art projects and a Children's 
Art Yard in which youths can enjoy face painting, labyrinth construction, 
storytelling, dance workshops and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
This year's demonstrations and workshops include Michael Lortsher's instruction 
in brush and ink Sumie painting, Coy Mooso's class in Ukrainian Egg Decorating, 
Jim Tuttle's hand-painted clothing techniques, Cami DeRosa's hand-built 
pottery, Kolene Kumpfer's basketry and others. 
</P>
<P>
The festival also presents performances in open-air venues on the festival 
grounds. This year's list of well-known international artists includes American 
avant-garde musician Morton Subotnick (June 21), the Texas-based musical 
funsters known as Brave Combo (June 23), Brazilian jazz pianist and singer 
Elaine Elias (June 24) and Danceafrica (June 24), a celebration of African and 
Afro-American dance. Local musical and dance ensembles are also featured. 
</P>
<P>
The festival charges $3 admission ($1 for children 12 or younger or seniors 62 
and older), which guarantees entry for the entire day of purchase. Family 
passes ($7) admit two parents and up to four children (12 years and under). The 
grounds are open daily from noon to midnight (until 6 p.m. on Sunday).

FOOTLOOSE IN KENNEBUNKPORT: PRESIDENT'S FRIENDLY HOMETOWN OFFERS A FEW SIMPLE 
PLEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until George Bush began strolling through his hometown as a presidential 
candidate, about the last thing of note that had happened here was the 
Historical Society's recovery of the old fog bell from Goat Island lighthouse a 
few miles offshore in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
If you include being totally wiped out by Indians in 1689, Kennebunkport has 
been home to a few historic events since its founding in 1653. Yet during its 
300-plus years it has hardly been a Lexington or Concord. 
</P>
<P>
Farming, fishing and sawmills along inland streams and the Kennebunk River were 
the first economic activities. But by the beginning of the 19th Century the 
shipbuilding industry was turning out 100 vessels a year. 
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the 19th Century, those affluent shipbuilders began 
putting up impressive homes in Greek Revival, Federal, Colonial and, later, 
Victorian styles. So in addition to being a lively summer resort, the little 
village has that old-fashioned, lived-in look of a New England seaside town. 
</P>
<P>
But good times or bad, one thing Kennebunkport has had going for it is natural 
beauty, sited as it is at the mouth of the Kennebunk River near the Atlantic's 
Cape Porpoise Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Any way you look at it, President Bush's forebears were pretty smart folks to 
have settled here. 
</P>
<P>
To get here: Fly Delta, TWA or Continental to Portland, Me., with changes. From 
there it's 30 minutes by car or bus on to Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? You can do the town's sights in a day, but with water 
sports, antique shopping and perhaps a bit of fishing, give it several days. 
Accommodations are moderately priced, up a notch for the summer season. Dining 
well is also moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The busy season is from mid-June until mid-October. And a 
trolley makes the rounds of many hotels and the mid-village shopping area for a 
50-cent ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Nonantum-Portside Resort (Ocean Avenue; $80 to $125 double) 
has a main hotel that is more than a century old, plus the new Portside also in 
traditional style but with water views from every room. There's a private 
marina, heated pool, tennis and golf nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms in the newly restored main hotel are comfortably old-fashioned and 
freshly painted with wicker furniture, TVs and pretty flowered walls. Most of 
the Portside rooms have their own balcony with trim white banisters. The dining 
room has a good selection of seafood, pretty straightforward thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The Welby Inn (Ocean Avenue; $60-$80 B&amp;B double) was built in 1900 by a 
prosperous sea captain. Seven rooms have handmade bedspreads, hooked-rag rugs, 
samplers on walls and flowers all over. Your breakfasts might consist of fresh 
fruit, eggs to order, apple-walnut bread, blueberry muffins and lots of tea or 
coffee. This charmer is owned and operated by the Knox family and is very 
popular, so write ahead for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at Goose Rocks (Dyke Road; $75-$105 double) is just outside town in a 
wooded setting overlooking saltwater marshes and near Goose Rocks Beach. The 
inn's 32 guest rooms are spread out in a traditional building, many of the 
rooms with four-posters. There's a pub lounge, deck area, pleasant library with 
plenty of books and a fireplace. The dining room has a blue-nautical motif, 
attractive stenciling on walls and good food and service. 
</P>
<P>
Shawmut Inn (Turbot's Creek Road; $90-$150 double) is right by the ocean, a 
huge complex built in 1913 with a main building, several other large ones and a 
clutch of separate cottages. A recreational director sees after things around 
the Olympic-size saltwater pool, volleyball, shuffleboard, jazz concerts on 
Sunday. All meals served, and a van takes you to and from the port area in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You haven't really lived until you've dug into a fresh 
Maine lobster, the world's best, with a side of "steamers" (soft clams), corn 
on the cob and a bowl of slaw. These are the basics of a beachside clambake, 
but many restaurants also serve them. In addition to the steamers you may find 
quahogs, a mud-loving clam that makes great chowder. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the lobster-clam headliners, look for sweet shrimp and scallops, 
baked, broiled or deep-fried. You might also scan menus for fresh ocean perch, 
pollack, cod, halibut, haddock, sole and shad roe in the spring. Nowhere will 
you find a greater variety of fresh seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Fruits show up in such favorites as apple crisps and apple pandowdy, blueberry 
and strawberry tarts and cobblers. Injun pudding is sure to destroy your daily 
calorie count, a heavy affair made of molasses, cornmeal, milk, sugar, butter 
and whatever seasonings the cook has on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Cafe Topher (Lower Harbor Village) couldn't be prettier, a 
downstairs pub with piano music, upstairs a lovely room with crisp pink linens, 
pink flowers, etched-glass dividers and a grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
Lobster fettuccini heads the list of numerous seafood dishes, several steaks 
and chicken entrees for landlubbers. The dessert menu promises homemade fruit 
pies "often," cherries jubilee "never." 
</P>
<P>
The Lobster Pot (Mills Road, Cape Porpoise) always has a steady crowd of locals 
willing to take the three-mile ride out there for simple decor, paper napkins, 
ceiling fans and unadorned fresh seafood. Choose your live lobster from the 
tank: $10.95 for a one-pounder, $16.95 for two. Most folks also go for the 
steamers at $5.85. You may start with clam or fish chowder, rich lobster stew. 
</P>
<P>
Seascapes (Cape Porpoise Pier) is a really lovely restaurant right over the 
water, with pastel pottery and lots of flowers highlighting the attractive 
decor. It has a small bar and marvelous views of the water in one of Maine's 
prettiest fishing villages. 
</P>
<P>
The menu reaches out with the likes of shrimp a la turkolimani, sauteed with 
fresh tomatoes and feta cheese; scallops sauteed with arugula and lime pesto; 
lobster braised in Drambuie cream; Maine crab cakes with tomato-rosemary sauce. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Eighteenth- and 19th-Century architecture buffs will have a field 
day here, with the Greek-Revival Nott House, White Columns, being the town 
showpiece. Built in 1853, it still has original wallpapers, carpets and 
furnishings. A tour of this one is a must. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Street has a line of beautiful homes of the last two centuries, and the 
1826 Wedding Cake House, built by a sea captain, is extraordinary in the true 
sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen antique shops in a small town are enough to set any antiquarian 
atwitter, so comb them for pewter, pine furniture, duck decoys, silver, 
scrimshaw, country cupboards and whatever else you absolutely need. 
</P>
<P>
Feisty striped bass draw fishermen to the mouth of the Kennebunk and Mousam 
rivers, while the deep-sea types head out on party boats for cod, mackerel, 
tuna and anything else biting in the Atlantic that day. 
</P>
<P>
And in this friendliest of all small towns, almost every hotel or inn has free 
bicycles to loan you, so strike out down the road and start meeting 
Kennebunkporters. You might even run into you-know-who taking a stroll.

MOBIL GUIDES FOR BUDGET TRAVELERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1989 Mobil Travel Guide "Lodgings for Less" steers budget-minded travelers 
to clean, comfortable and highly rated accommodations throughout the United 
States and Canada. Average price per night for two is about $50. (As rooms for 
less than $50 are scarce in some areas, the guide also lists more costly 
lodgings when necessary.) 
</P>
<P>
Information is contained in three compact regional volumes covering major 
cities and resort areas in the South, Northeast/Midwest (plus Canada) and West 
(plus Canada). Published by Prentice Hall, each volume retails at bookstores 
and other outlets for $5.95.

SOME TIPS FOR THE TRAVELING FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some family traveling tips from the Automobile Assn. of America: 
</P>
<P>
Suggested budget for a family of four -- two adults and two children -- is $168 
a day for lodging and meals, plus $8 per 100 miles for gas, oil, tires and 
maintenance (with a car averaging 23 miles a gallon). 
</P>
<P>
The average cost for lodging is $78 a night, based on the rates charged by 
approved accommodations listed in AAA TourBooks. This rate includes $5 nightly 
per child. However, if children are within an age limit set by the management, 
usually up to 14, there may not be an extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
Families traveling in Southern California probably will spend a little more 
than the national average, according to AAA figures. The average cost of 
lodging will be $10 to $15 more and gas prices probably will be about $5 more. 
This adds up to an average daily cost of $188 for a family of four traveling in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Vacation spending depends on a family's preferences and means, but costs vary 
by area. Higher rates can be expected in large metropolitan areas and at 
resorts in season.

SUMMER VACATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE, Times Travel Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer, that sweetest of seasons, soon will cast its spell upon the land . . . 
while the nagging we know as wanderlust takes its annual toll. Rivers will rush 
through gorges and glacial valleys, and breezes will scatter summer's fragrance 
. . . apple blossoms and honeysuckle and new-mown hay. 
</P>
<P>
Vacationers will motor to the seashore and mountains and to ranches from 
Washington to Wyoming and Maine to Minnesota, where darkness will bring out the 
spectacle of a near-for-gotten Milky Way. Others will stroll along towpaths 
beside the Delaware and raft down rivers boiling with white water. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is a time for rediscovering rural America with its white-steepled 
churches, endless plains and rolling hills. Vacationers will cast for trout and 
explore miles of forested land while eagles wheel overhead and the chorus of 
crickets rises like the echo from a childhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
Those arriving from the city will find solace in country inns, their prize 
being an elusive peace and a turn-of-the-century hospitality reflecting a 
former America. 
</P>
<P>
Small-town America. New England villages will come into focus as motorists 
cross covered bridges and pass mile after mile of weathered barns scattered 
across hills as verdant as rain-fresh Ireland. Summer in America means salmon 
rivers rushing headlong into the Pacific . . . concerts on the green . . . 
apple orchards and wind-blown grass. 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast the sea will turn white with sails and youngsters will sculpt 
sandcastles while sandpipers run with the tide. 
</P>
<P>
Others will be lured to destinations far from these shores: Restless souls will 
jet off to fashionable Portofino for an espresso at La Stella and to the 
sidewalk cafes of St. Tropez . . . the bazaars of Hong Kong . . . the temples 
of Thailand . . . the open reaches of Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
It is to the summer traveler that we dedicate our section today. JERRY HULSE, 
Times Travel Editor

THE BARGAIN CORNER: FREQUENT GUEST CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego-based TraveLodge and Viscount Hotels, subsidiaries of Trusthouse 
Forte Hotels, are offering free membership in a new frequent guest club. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to stay at any of the 500 participating properties in North 
America to join. Though the TraveLodge Business Break Club is geared to attract 
business travelers, it is open to pleasure travelers as well. 
</P>
<P>
The club has set a target of 50,000 members, which it expects to reach by the 
end of May. At that point the program may be changed and a membership fee 
assessed. However, existing members will get any new benefits that may be added 
to the program after May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10% Discount 
</P>
<P>
The major benefit of membership is a guaranteed 10% discount at all TraveLodge 
and Viscount hotels, when rooms are available. No charge is levied for a second 
person staying in the room, and free room upgrades are provided on a 
space-available basis. Indicate that you are a club member when making a 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, you get a coupon booklet with five vouchers worth $5 each at 
Viscount properties and $3 each at TraveLodge properties, which can be combined 
with the 10% discount. 
</P>
<P>
Applications can be picked up at any TraveLodge or Viscount Hotel. You can also 
get an application, as well as more information, by calling the chain toll free 
at (800) 526-CLUB. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Inns is continuing its Winter Great Rates weekend program through April 
30. More than 1,000 of the chain's properties, including Holiday Inn Crowne 
Plazas, are participating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Rate Cuts 
</P>
<P>
The promotion covers Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, with rates either $35, 
$45, $55, or $59 per room a night, depending on the hotel and type of room. 
Contact travel agents or Holiday Inns at (800) 228-3000. 
</P>
<P>
These discount programs are generally run on a capacity-controlled, 
space-available basis. Consequently, the amount of rooms available at lower 
rates can vary from hotel to hotel and weekend to weekend. The earlier you make 
a reservation, the better your chances of getting a lower rate. JACK ADLER

MOST ARE NO LONGER RATTLED BY EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS and JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 24 hours since the earthquake at Newport Beach, the worst jolt in the 
area since the big one in 1933, and how nervous was Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people went to the earthquake preparedness exposition in Irvine, 
where safety products and lectures on earthquake survival were offered. 
</P>
<P>
And about 105,000 went to the epicenter of the quake, to Newport Beach, where 
aftershocks were possible but where the sand was warm and the air a cool 70 
degrees and the water only 5 degrees cooler. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Malner, 18, of Fontana was lying on the sand when the quake hit Friday at 
1:07 p.m. "It felt like they were blowing up the pier," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Worried 
</P>
<P>
Worried? "No," she said. Saturday, she was back on the sand, soaking up sun. 
</P>
<P>
Such Southern California cool was something new to Michael Greene, 26, recently 
transplanted from Sun Valley, Ida., and now doorman at Mutt Lynch's bar facing 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's was his first earthquake. "The strangest thing was that when the 
earthquake stopped, the crowd gave a big round of applause," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," he said, joining in the spirit, "if it happens, it happens." 
</P>
<P>
If the beach crowd needed justification for its blase attitude, it could have 
found it Saturday at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Martinez, a seismic analyst, said that underground activity in Newport 
Beach "is back to normal." There had been no major aftershocks and only one or 
two "very small" aftershocks that probably were not even felt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Chance of Action 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing," Martinez said. "If something was going to happen, it 
probably would have happened by now. There's a 95% chance nothing's going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone had returned to normal, however. At the "Ready or Not Emergency 
Expo" at the Irvine Civic Center, the parking lot, courtyard and Police 
Department auditorium had been turned over to merchants, service organizations 
and UC Irvine Extension lecturers, all beating the drum about being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
At one end, a puppet show attracted a handful of young children. 
</P>
<P>
"That earthquake was sure scary," the teddy bear said. "I was so scared I ran 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
"That was a bad idea," Officer Ollie said. "Don't you know earthquake rules?" 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't, there were stacks of comic books to instruct you, along with 
books and pamphlets and flyers for your parents. 
</P>
<P>
There were also lines of vendors hawking wrenches for turning off gas and water 
mains; radio that run by cranking them; reserve batteries that are supposed to 
hold their charge for 20 years, and emergency water in bottles, boxes and bags. 
</P>
<P>
There were T-shirts stamped "Whose Fault Is It?" and candles, waterproof 
matches, potty bags, folding knives, first-aid kits, dried food, canned food, a 
sort of sedan chair for carrying the disabled up and down stairs, and the 
electronic Quakeawake, which is supposed to sense the earliest tremors and give 
20 to 30 seconds of warning. 
</P>
<P>
Frannie Winslow, Irvine's emergency management coordinator, said the planning 
for the expo began last October with no idea that Saturday would be the best 
possible date for the event -- the day after a particularly sharp, frightening 
but low-level quake. No major injury or damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping people now will be motivated to protect themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It worked on Ed and Jeanne McWhirter of Irvine. They were at the fair to finish 
the earthquake survival kit they had begun months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We got everything in it -- dog food, cat food, Kitty Litter, extra glasses -- 
but no food!" Ed McWhirter said. 
</P>
<P>
About $70 later, the McWhirters had enough freeze-dried food for two people for 
2 days, a wrench for shutting off the gas main and three plastic-lined boxes 
designed to store water for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, you don't have to sell. They're buying," said Crystal Snedaker, who 
brought her merchandise from her store in Hacienda Heights. "This area is 
really active on preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing an estimated 1,500 to the 6-hour exposition set a record in the event's 
3-year history, Winslow said.

An agreement to gradually transfer ownership of a 5,360-acre preserve of oak 
groves and canyon lands to the county will be discussed Tuesday by the Board of 
Supervisors. The area, known as Limestone Canyon, is currently owned by the 
Irvine Co. and is east of Irvine and north of the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
The deal hinges on the completion of the eastern toll road and two Irvine Co. 
developments -- Northwood Village in Irvine and East Orange in Orange. As 
certain phases of those projects are reached, the Irvine Co. will dedicate 
sections of the park to the county.

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WILD GOOSE CHASE: It's called Quail Hill, but its most famous residents are 
geese. The Irvine slope, located along the San Diego Freeway and bounded by 
Jeffrey Road and Sand Canyon Avenue, is where thousands of migratory Canada 
geese congregate for 3 months each winter to rest and feed among the grazing 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The birds also use nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir, and move to and from the 
fields each morning and evening, providing a spectacle for freeway commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations to make the Quail Hill area a reserve for the geese continue, 
according to John Simon, who is helping to coordinate the project as an aide to 
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. A 360-acre preserve at Quail Hill is part of an 
open-space agreement between the city and the Irvine Co., reached last year and 
approved by the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still the Irvine Co.'s at the moment," Simon said. The property will 
eventually be turned over to the city in exchange for development rights in 
other parts of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
This year, only about 1,200 geese wintered at the site, down from as many as 
4,000 last year. The last of the geese headed north in March, and the city has 
taken the opportunity to attack a problem of invading artichoke thistles on the 
property. The non-native plants spread a poison that kills native grasses, and 
their leaves also inhibit other growth by blocking sunlight to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
If left unchecked, Simon said, the intruders could seriously affect the amount 
of plant material available for foraging by the geese. 
</P>
<P>
Another priority is deciding how to develop the area between Quail Hill and the 
reservoir without inhibiting the movement of the geese between the areas, Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The geese are shy of humans, which makes any plans to provide visitor 
facilities for viewing the birds tricky. A roadside pullout with informational 
signs is one possibility, Simon said. Another is an observation area at the 
reservoir, which is not currently open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said he has visited the reservoir to view the geese on early winter 
mornings. "When they take off and start honking, it's quite a sight," he said. 
"It would be nice to involve the public in something like that."

In 1973, two young ministers thought they had hit on just the right formula to

innovative, upbeat Christian programming, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

<P>
But after only 6 months it became clear to Paul F. Crouch and Jim Bakker that 
the Orange County television station they chose as their laboratory -- and the 
flagship for Trinity Broadcasting Network -- was just too small for the 
ambitions of the two strong-willed men and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from who won, the precise details of the struggle that followed are still 
in dispute, except that the tactics used by both sides might be considered of 
the hard-knuckled variety more common to the corporate world than to the 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bakkers, who lost, the maneuvering for the station left a permanent 
fear of sharing power with anyone. According to a new book, "Don't Call Me 
Brother," by former evangelist Austin Miles, they felt "betrayed" by the 
struggle with the Crouches. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim and Tammy were sensitive to the point of being fragile," Miles writes. 
"They had built the Trinity Broadcasting Network up from nothing. Then their 
employers, Paul and Jan Crouch, dumped them. That betrayal hurt Jim and Tammy 
deeply. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"We put our very souls into (the station). Then it was literally stolen out 
from under us," Jim Bakker is quoted as saying. "I'm going to do things 
differently this time. Nobody will ever take a television ministry away from us 
again." 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost that station in California, that really did it. We thought the 
world had ended," Tammy Bakker told Miles. 
</P>
<P>
For Crouch, the outcome reinforced the belief that his victory was evidence of 
a Divine plan. He later wrote in a brochure that after some "confusion and 
dissension . . . it was apparent that God was leading Jim and Tammy into 
another ministry."

3 TEEN-AGERS HURT AS GUNFIRE SPRAYS CROWD IN PLACENTIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three teen-agers were wounded early Saturday in Placentia when gunfire from a 
passing car sprayed a crowd of youths standing on a street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the shooting at 12:30 a.m. in the 900 block of Easton Street 
followed the car, which the occupants eventually abandoned on a dead-end 
street. The witnesses directed police to the car. 
</P>
<P>
Officers, however, only found Louis Richard Morales, 21, of Anaheim, who was 
booked at Orange County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder. The others 
remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
Wounded by bullet fragments in the 12:30 a.m. shooting was Regina Kris Torres, 
18, Anaheim; a 15-year-old girl from Orange who received a minor gunshot wound 
to a buttock; a 16-year-old boy from Buena Park with a minor gunshot wound to 
the forearm, and a 16-year-old from Buena Park who injured her elbow while 
diving for cover. 
</P>
<P>
All were treated a Placentia Linda Community Hospital and released, police 
said.

ANGELS' 7-0 DEFEAT PINNED ON ABBOTT, NOT ALL THE BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Angels didn't precisely soar, trumpets did indeed blare -- there was a 
pregame battle of the bands -- on the night of Jim Abbott's major-league debut. 
</P>
<P>
There were also ticket lines longer than those down the street at the 
Matterhorn, four Japanese television crews on location and enough curiosity to 
fill 46,847 seats at Anaheim Stadium Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the clamor and great expectation of the occasion, Angel Manager Doug Rader 
stopped squinting into the camera lights long enough to make a simple request 
of Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope he enjoys it," Rader said. "A player's first day in the big 
leagues should be enjoyable, something to savor and remember. But it seems with 
Jim, all this attention might take that away him, and that would be too bad." 
</P>
<P>
As Abbott discovered in his career-opening 7-0 loss to the Seattle Mariners, 
such simple things in life are not always that simple. 
</P>
<P>
Standing alone on the mound that served as his private eye in the hurricane, 
Abbott surrendered hits to the first two batters he faced as a professional and 
allowed two runs in his first professional inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the second inning: Side retired, 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
And the third: Error, single and walk to load the bases; double play to emerge 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
And the fourth: Side down again, 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, very finally, the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Betrayed by his nerves, his teammates' defense and a twist of luck, Abbott 
yielded four runs in the fifth, leaving the game, trailing, 6-0, with one more 
out needed to end the inning. All of the runs scored after Angel second baseman 
Mark McLemore botched a potential double play grounder, with the first two 
coming home on a broken-bat flare to right by Seattle's Alvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the runs were unearned, but that statistic was of little consequence 
or consolation to Abbott afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disappointed," Abbott said from behind the podium during a 
postgame press conference. "I don't think I threw too well. I felt sometimes I 
battled OK and I made some pitches I'm proud of, but overall, I didn't do as 
much as I'm capable of." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers supported such an assessment. In 4 2/3 innings, Abbott allowed six 
runs (three earned) on six hits, three walks and one wild pitch. Of the 83 
pitches he threw, Mariner batters swung and missed only twice. Abbott did not 
strike out a batter, had as many as two strikes in the count only five times 
and surrendered Davis' crushing bloop single on an 0-and-2 delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was a little unnerved by all the attention," Abbott said. "Today, 
maybe my mind wasn't as clearly focused as I'd have liked it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Rader certainly saw it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this poor guy's been going through this," Rader said as his 
took his turn behind the microphone in the crowded interview room. "Under the 
conditions, I thought he pitched outstanding. Had it not been for a misplayed 
ball and a bloop hit, it would've been a different ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I thought he handled himself very well." 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were unprecedented. Abbott, 21, is the 15th player to make 
the jump from high school or college to the major leagues since the inception 
of baseball's amateur draft in 1965 -- but the first to do it with one hand. 
</P>
<P>
Such distinguishing traits made Abbott the major story of the Angels' training 
camp, as well as a focus of controversy when the Angels announced they would 
begin the 1989 regular season with Abbott not only on the roster, but in the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
There were immediate charges publicity-mongering, of using Abbott to sell 
tickets in the short-term at the long-term expense of his baseball career. The 
Angels, and Rader in particular, were second-guessed for rushing Abbott to the 
major leagues without the benefit of minor league development. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one story written saying I was using Abbott just to protect my butt, 
because I only have a one-year contract," Rader said. "Then there's the talk of 
this being a publicity stunt. To me, all that is so incredibly distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
"When we announced Jim had made the team, I didn't anticipate anything like 
this. I thought people would figure, 'Well, they say he's emotionally and 
physically ready and he's one of their 10 best arms. Sounds OK to me.' What a 
jerk I am. Johnny Naive. 
</P>
<P>
"To insinuate the things that have been insinuated, to think there is any 
selfish motivation for pitching Jim except for the very reason we're trying to 
win a . . . game is plainly irresponsible and unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott and Co.: The Angel rookie became the 15th player to make his 
professional debut in the majors since 1965 and the inception of baseball's 
amateur draft. Abbott is the first since 1985, when outfielder Pete Incaviglia 
went straight from Oklahoma State to the Texas Rangers. The rest of the list: 
pitcher Mike Adamson (Baltimore, 1967); pitcher Steve Dunning (Cleveland, 
1969); pitcher Pete Broberg (Washington, 1971); pitcher Burt Hooton (Chicago 
Cubs, 1971); third baseman Dave Roberts (San Diego, 1972); pitcher Dick Ruthven 
(Philadelphia, 1973); outfielder Dave Winfield (San Diego, 1973); pitcher David 
Clyde (Texas, 1973); pitcher Eddie Bane (Minnesota, 1973); third baseman Bob 
Horner (Atlanta, 1978); catcher Brian Milner (Toronto, 1978); pitcher Mike 
Morgan (Oakland, 1978); and pitcher Tim Conroy (Oakland, 1978). . . . Add List: 
Of the pitchers, only Hooton had a winning record (2-0) in his first season. 
The combined first-year record of the other eight pitchers: 19-44. 
</P>
<P>
The school-to-majors jump may be a rare one, but Angel batting coach Deron 
Johnson now been in uniform for three such debuts. Johnson played for the 
Kansas City Athletics in 1961, when pitcher Lew Krausse went from high school 
to the A's, and played against Texas on the day Clyde broke in with the Rangers 
in 1973. . . . Abbott wasn't the only reason the Angels looked different 
Saturday night. Manager Doug Rader also started a lineup featuring Tony Armas 
in right field (and batting cleanup), Dante Bichette in center field, Bill 
Schroeder at catcher and Glenn Hoffman at third base. "We wanted to give Devon 
(White) and Lance (Parrish) the day off," Rader explained. "Also, Jack Howell 
hasn't had much success against Mark Langston and Claudell (Washington) has 
never faced him before." Howell has a .188 career batting average against 
Langston, but he's not the only Angel who doesn't hit the Seattle left-hander. 
Through 1988, Parrish was .143 (2 for 14) against him, White .095 (2 for 21), 
Wally Joyner .158 (3 for 19) and Dick Schofield .138 (4 for 29). Joyner and 
Schofield remained in the starting lineup, however, because somebody had to 
play.

ORANGE COUNTY BOYS' TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
MAGNOLIA'S SINGBANDITH SETS MEET RECORD IN LONG JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Phouphot Singbandith of Magnolia High School broke the meet record in the long 
jump with a leap of 22 feet 10 inches Saturday in the Orange County Boys' Track 
and Field Championships at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was maybe a 48 (in the triple jump)," said Singbandith, who was 
given the field athlete of the meet award for his performances. "My previous 
best was 47." 
</P>
<P>
So he was off by a couple of feet. The next best triple jump mark of 46-10 1/2 
was recorded by Esperanza's Clayton Tharrington. 
</P>
<P>
He also came within a half-inch of tying the county record in the triple jump 
with a leap of 50-3. Ken Williams of Troy set the record in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The meet team championship was decided by just one point as Capistrano Valley 
staved off a late charge by Woodbridge, 63-62. Edison finished third with 40 
points and Esperanza was fourth with 35. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley led by as much as 20 points early in the meet as it won the 
400-meter relay with a time of 42.4 seconds and the 1600 with Neal Stevenson's 
4 minutes, 23.07 second effort. 
</P>
<P>
But Woodbridge pulled to 47-45 after Chad McHenry won the 300-meter hurdles 
with a time of 39.16. Capistrano Valley expected to gain a better advantage in 
the 200-meters, where the Eagles' Joe White was favored to win, but Canyon's 
Jerrard Bryant won it with a time of 21.98. White finished second in 22.30. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant also defeated White in the 400-meters by one-one hundredth of a second 
-- 49.52 to White's 49.53. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge won the 3,200 relay (3:24.18) and Capistrano Valley finished second 
(3:27.81) to put the Eagles in front, 63-56, with the triple jump and pole 
vault left. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Capulong finished fifth (two points) in the triple jump to pull 
Woodbridge to 63-58. 
</P>
<P>
That meant a third by Woodbridge in the pole vault would give it the 
championship if Capistrano Valley didn't place. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles didn't place, but Graham Heppensdall finished fourth (13-6), 
allowing Capistrano Valley to win by the one-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it was certainly interesting," said Capistrano Valley coach Tom White. 
"But a championship is a championship and we'll be proud to to take this one." 
</P>
<P>
"We have some team depth and we were pleased with the whole team's 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge did have the track athlete of the meet in Louie Muniz. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz won the 110 hurdles with a time of 15.09 and the 300 hurdles with a time 
of 39.16.

ARCADIA INVITATIONAL TRACK MEET; 
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR BOYS SET DISTANCE MEDLEY RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Although Orange County athletes managed just two victories at the Arcadia 
Invitational track and field meet Saturday night, most found what they came 
looking for: 
</P>
<P>
Fast times. 
</P>
<P>
Especially Corona del Mar's boys distance medley team of Greg Shryock, Mark 
Barnum, Jay Lightburn and Eddie Lavelle. 
</P>
<P>
As happens since the inception of the meet 22 years ago, Arcadia provided the 
quality competition, the all-weather track and the cool night air that helps to 
provide for personal, school, and in the Sea Kings' case, county records. 
</P>
<P>
With Shryock (3:07.7 for 1,200 meters); Barnum (49.83 for 400), Lightburn 
(1:57.3 for 800) and Lavelle (4:13 for 1,600), the Corona del Mar foursome sped 
to victory in 10 minutes 9.71 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
That time not only broke the school record of 10:17 set here two years ago, and 
the meet record of 10:13.6 set by Crescenta Valley 13 years ago, but it also 
broke the Orange County record of 10:15.06 set by El Modena in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is the fastest time in the nation this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle anchored the victorious relay by holding off Walnut's Scott Hempel, a 
longtime rival, who finished six seconds back at 10:15.5. The performance was 
particularly impressive since less than two hours earlier, Lavelle placed 
second in the open 1,600 in 4:11.94, the fourth-fastest time in the nation this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran great, especially with Eddie coming back off that 4:11," said Sea 
King Coach Bill Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
The other victory won by a county team was that of Mission Viejo's girls 1,600 
relay, which, with the anchoring of freshman Andrea Dean, won the seeded event 
in 3:56.07. Dean had about a 20-yard lead with 200 meters to go, but had to 
hold off Oxnard Rio Hondo senior Angela Burham, the fastest returning 200-meter 
runner in the nation and Track &amp; Field News' female athlete of the year in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Right near the end I didn't think I could stay strong so I just tried to hold 
on," Dean said. "I heard the crowd, too, so I knew she was real close. It was 
real exciting." 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 3,200, University freshman Tanja Brix ran the 16th fastest time 
in county history with a 10:54 clocking for fourth place. Brix finished 13 
seconds behind winner Lisa Dressel of Spokane, Wash. Dressel's time of 10:41.23 
is the best in the nation this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' 3,200, Dana Hills' Mike Tansley was fourth in 9:10.11, a school 
record by six seconds and the fastest county time this year. And in the girls' 
1,600, Edison freshman Shelley Taylor was sixth in 5:09.53, a personal best by 
10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente sophomore Tim Martin found his first experience at Arcadia fun, 
but somewhat trying. Martin finished seventh in both the 100 meters (10.91) and 
the 200 (22.22), as he was outclassed, outsized and overpowered. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys are big and those guys are fast," Martin said of the 200-meter 
field, whose top three finishers -- San Francisco's Barry Smith (21.34), 
Mayfair's Erik Mitchell (21.35) and Oakland's Jeff Laynes (21.38) -- recorded 
the top three times in the nation this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other top county performances included Edison's Doug Nichols, who placed fourth 
in the 800 in 1:53.93; El Dorado's Lori Svoboda, second in the high jump at 
5-8; Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer, fifth in the 400 (57.75) and Mission Viejo's 
Tammy Graham, seventh in the 300 hurdles (47.62). 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's girls 400 relay was seventh in 49.67. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning's open portion of the meet, Mater Dei's Melissa McDonald set an 
open meet record by winning the high jump at 5-7. Other county winners in the 
morning meet were Irvine's Bev Oden in the discus (131-4) and Westminster's 
Shellie Tochluk in the 400 meters (56.96).

MATER DEI'S CORLISS CONTINUES TO IMPRESS, STRIKES OUT 10 IN 9-4 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tony Pena, generally regarded as the best pitcher in Orange County, might have 
some competition from a member of his own team at Mater Dei High School before 
the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Corliss continued an impressive senior season Saturday at Anaheim, 
striking out 10 and allowing only four hits in five innings in a 9-4 victory 
over Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Corliss (4-1) was the team's fifth starter last season when Pena (5-0 this 
season) fashioned a 10-1 record in leading Mater Dei to the Angelus League 
title. This year, Corliss has emerged as a college prospect with a lively 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott throws as well as Tony, he just doesn't have the game experience," said 
Bob Ickes, Mater Dei coach. "He's getting better and better with each outing." 
</P>
<P>
Corliss was in trouble only once, yielding three hits in the third inning. He 
escaped without giving up a run, however, when Servite's Ed Crippen was ruled 
out at the plate for aggressive contact with catcher Rob Ickes while attempting 
to score on a single by Rob Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Corliss struck out five consecutive batters in the fourth and fifth innings 
before retiring at the end of the fifth after throwing 90 pitches in 90-degree 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (12-3, 3-1) scored three runs in the third inning and added four more 
in the fifth in coasting to its seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs used two hits with two walks to score three times in the third, 
and Jason Kirrer's two-run double was the big blow in the fifth. Every starter 
had at least one hit except for Ickes and left fielder Juan Zarate. 
</P>
<P>
Losing pitcher Chad Troxel (3-3) struggled with his control, walking seven 
before leaving in the fifth inning. Servite (9-6-1, 2-2) played without 
starters Tom Jacobs and Mark Tacconelli, who were suspended for two games for 
breaking a team rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom is our best hitter and leads the team in RBIs and home runs, but I don't 
know if the suspensions really affected us that much today," said Mike McNary, 
Servite coach. "Corliss took the wind out of our sails. We were pretty laid 
back but finally came alive a little in the last inning." 
</P>
<P>
Walker, Servite's designated hitter, drove a three-run homer over the 
center-field fence off reliever Brian Franklin in the seventh inning, giving 
him two hits for the day. Greg Carl, Mater Dei's leadoff hitter, had two hits, 
a walk, stole a base and scored a run. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can stop Greg, you can stop our offense," Ickes said. "He came into the 
game hitting .559 and has now stolen successfully on 15 of 16 attempts. He's 
played a big part in our success." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei lost its league opener to Bishop Montgomery for the second 
consecutive season, but the Monarchs have now established themselves as the 
favorite in the Angelus League, at least according to McNary. 
</P>
<P>
"They were tough with Pena throwing, but now that Corliss has come on, they're 
twice as tough," McNary said. "Whoever wins the league, is going to have to 
beat Mater Dei to claim the title." 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunset League: 
</P>
<P>
Edison 6, Westminster 2 -- Jason Serafin drove in four runs with a home run and 
a single and Jim Futami held Westminster to four hits to lift the Chargers (3-2 
in the league). Center fielder Serafin hit a three-run home run in the top of 
the first, added a run-scoring single in the seventh inning, and also threw a 
runner out at the plate in the second inning. Futami (2-0) struck out eight 
batters and walked one. Westminster is 1-4 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 2, Marina 1 -- Brent Woken went five innings, giving up four hits 
and striking out four to earn the victory. Mike Karpel picked up the save with 
two scoreless innings. Mike Burns, who was two for three, drove in both runs 
for Ocean View (12-4, 4-1) with a single in the third inning. Marina is 9-6 
overall and 2-3 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 4, Huntington Beach 0 -- Jeff Hale pitched his second 
consecutive shutout, allowing six hits, striking out one and walking one. John 
Orcher provided the offensive punch for Fountain Valley (9-4, 4-1) with a

Western High School got a lot of mileage out of three hits, but not enough to 
take the team to an extra-inning victory against the Southern Section 3-A's 
top-ranked team, La Mirada, in the 4-A final of the Canyon High School 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
La Mirada displayed outstanding pitching, superior quickness and near-flawless 
defense to capture the tournament title with a 2-1, 10-inning decision 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 1-1, third baseman Amy Allingham hit a single up the 
middle to score catcher Rose Garces from second. It was the 10th hit of the 
game for La Mirada (14-1). 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we stayed with them all the way," said Western Coach Debbie 
Harless. "We just didn't have the hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for that was La Mirada pitcher Dena Mullin, who gave up 
three hits and struck out 12. She didn't walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Pinkerton sisters, senior shortstop Ivy, and junior third baseman 
Misty, managed any offense for the Pioneers (14-3), the second-ranked team in 
the Southern Section 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Ivy, who went two for three, ripped a single past second with two outs in the 
top of the seventh. She then stole second. On a two-and-one count, Misty 
singled over the second baseman's head. Ivy slid home safely when catcher Rose 
Garces dropped the throw from center field, tying the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadores had scored in the third inning. Designated hitter Kim Kirkley 
beat out a bunt. Shortstop Jenny Hambly bunted and Western catcher Lisa 
Sciarrino fielded the ball cleanly, but threw it in the dirt past first base. 
Kirkley scored on the error, the first of three for Western. 
</P>
<P>
"They were nervous going in," Harless said of her players. "They had too many 
errors because of that nervousness, and they didn't hit like they could." But 
Harless said she and her team had no excuses. "I think La Mirada is the fastest 
team we've seen and they put the ball in play and run," she said. "You get a 
lot done that way." 
</P>
<P>
Ivy Pinkerton, who had nine assists and three putouts, was named the 
tournament's most valuable defensive player. Misty also was named to the 
all-tournament team. Mullin (14-1) was the most valuable pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
In other 4-A games:

Sunny Hills 2, Diamond Bar 1 -- Senior pitcher Amy Huett (3-2) struck out nine 
and allowed only three hits to lead Sunny Hills (11-4) to a third-place finish.

Kelly Ward and catcher Erin McKenney, and a two-out single by left fielder 
Shannon Brown.

their runs in the seventh inning as Cheryl Longeway (8-2) struck out eight and 
walked none. 
</P>

Valencia 2, Garden Grove 0 -- Junior right-hander Natasha Dumoski had six 
strikeouts in a complete-game performance to give Valencia (5-9) ninth place.
