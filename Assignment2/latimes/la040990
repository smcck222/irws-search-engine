A child named Desire screams from her crib in limbo. She was brought into a 
children's shelter after being battered at home by a blow that knocked one 
hemisphere of her brain against the interior of her skull. She is nearly blind, 
seeing only shadows her brain cannot comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
"She cries incessantly," so she can't go home, "because she invites more 
abuse," says her caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
Desire lives in the limbo maintained by the County of Los Angeles for children 
who are waiting, often in vain, for permanent placement in foster homes. The 
county foster-care system is, with New York City's, one of the two largest in 
America. It is also considered one of the worst in California by state 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Every month, responding to reports of abandonment and abuse, the county takes 
custody of 1,000 children. Removing them from their homes, it assumes 
responsibility for those children and for trying to reunite families. 
</P>
<P>
The county treats this awesome responsibility with awful indifference. It is 
such a neglectful stepparent that the state Department of Social Services 
threatens to take over some of the county Department of Children's Services 
functions because of poor monitoring of children in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
The children's agency was spun off from the county Department of Public Social 
Services in 1984 to focus on the needs of abused, abandoned and neglected 
children. It administers state and federal assistance programs and has the 
legal responsibility for protecting and providing for children without parents. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. (County) isn't doing any of that," says public-interest lawyer Carole 
Shauffer. "They're making things worse." 
</P>
<P>
Jesus is one of the children under the county's custody. In 1985, both of his 
parents, PCP users, committed suicide. Jesus became a ward of the court, which 
placed him in his grandparents' custody, even though a social worker reportedly 
had been warned that they had a mean streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Children's Services had responsibility for checking on Jesus, 
who at age 9 weighed only 28 1/2 pounds and could not express himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not visited or monitored by that department for a period of four 
months," says a subsequent trial summary. "During this time, (Jesus) was 
sodomized, burned with cigarettes and beaten. On June 30, 1986, he almost 
drowned. As a result, Jesus is now a spastic quadriplegic and totally 
dependent." 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to believe that the state would be a more protective guardian 
than the county. But the pattern of child neglect goes straight to the office 
of Gov. George Deukmejian, who has consistently taken away funding for 
desperately needed child health programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy doesn't seem to work for children," says Helen Kleinberg, watchdog 
and foster-care advocate. "They don't vote, they don't organize, and they don't 
give money. Any time there's a battle for money between adult and children's 
services, the adults win." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most branches of government, the department operates largely beyond 
public scrutiny, yet its power over young lives is vast. It has the authority 
to directly intervene in parent-child disputes, to remove children from their 
parents, and to assign them to foster homes. The department advises the 
Juvenile Dependency Court on the needs of each child in the system, and then it 
executes -- and sometimes fails to execute -- the court's orders. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to imagine a more powerful and potentially invasive role for a 
government agency. In the 1990s, when the breakdown of the family is 
catastrophic, when violent child abuse is epidemic, and when more and more 
babies are taken away from drug-addicted parents at birth, adequate foster care 
is more crucial than ever. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be hard to find a more neglected agency than the Department of 
Children's Services, or a more overburdened institution than the Dependency 
Court. Public interest is strangely missing; the county Board of Supervisors 
gets more attention for meetings on animal rights than for children's programs, 
says Kleinberg, their untiring advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Like the children whom it frequently fails, the foster-care system is the poor 
stepchild of the county. 
</P>
<P>
At any one time, 50,000 children are under the supervision of Children's 
Services. About 33,000 of them are the direct wards of the county, living in 
foster homes or other settings apart from their parents. These figures are 
disputed by the state, which claims that the county may be carrying inactive 
cases in its files. This may be true. But over an 18-year cycle, hundreds of 
thousands of children pass through the system, however briefly, and they are at 
risk of becoming a generation marked by deep antipathy to the state and 
society. Although foster children make up less than 1% of the population under 
18, they constititute 25% of the delinquents in the custody of the California 
Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like building an underclass," says Carole Shauffer, one of the 
public-interest attorneys who filed the class-action suit that drew the state's 
attention and its wrath. 
</P>
<P>
Building an underclass is hard work. It costs a lot of money to make sure that 
children don't get the care they need. It costs money in administration of 
neglect, in ordering care that won't be given (because the state doesn't pay 
for services it requires), and in punishing child-abusers for continuing the 
cycle of abuse that they inherited. 
</P>
<P>
Building an underclass needs, and gets, help from a lot of sources that will 
benefit. Industry, technology, the drug trade and the professions all do their 
part. For its part, society turns its back. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of negligence are the focus of a state inquiry into the management 
of the Department of Children's Services and of a class-action suit against the 
county. The county has retaliated by threatening to make the state take over 
its licensing burden unless Sacramento provides enough funds to fulfill its 
mandates. 
</P>
<P>
One state official scoffs that the county can't even figure out what its myriad 
problems are, much less how to fix them. If there's one word that comes up when 
judges, social workers and parents discuss the county, it's overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not overwhelmed," says Robert Chaffee, director of the Department of 
Children's Services. "The department's not in chaos, (not) paralyzed or 
inactive." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of children in foster care have been raped, sodomized, beaten. A few 
have been murdered. One-hundred and eighteen children have died in the system, 
"all but 11 by natural causes," says Chaffee. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus, like many victims of child abuse, was not able to testify in criminal 
court. The district attorney never filed charges against Jesus' grandfather. 
His grandmother was given 300 days in jail. Nothing happened to the social 
worker assigned to Jesus' case. 
</P>
<P>
A few face-to-face visits with Jesus by an observant social worker back in 1985 
could have prevented him from being tortured -- and saved the county millions 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus' attorney sued the county. The county argued that it was not required to 
have face-to-face contact with Jesus, and that the granting of guardianship (to 
the grandparents) relieved it of any responsibility. But state law mandates 
monthly face-to-face contact. A Superior Court jury ordered the county to pay 
$5,466,248 in damages. That sum would cover the annual wages of 168 additional 
social workers to visit thousands of children like Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
Big Brother may be a fictional fantasy to most of us, but to thousands of 
children, Big Stepparent is a real torment. Foster care in the richest 
metropolis of the richest state of the richest nation in the world resembles a 
Third World nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
People in the system try hard, often at great personal sacrifice, to do a good 
job. They do succeed in protecting many children from harm. Devoted foster 
families give at least a semblance of stability to countless children's lives. 
Underpaid and overworked, care-givers deserve not only thanks; they also should 
have a part in rethinking and reforming the system. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no comprehensive plan at any level, federal, state or local," says 
Judy Nelson, director of the nonprofit Children's Bureau. "There is no 
comprehensive objective assessment for when children are removed from home. 
There's no emphasis on prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee chafes at such criticism: "Because society hasn't got a solution, 
they're irritated as hell because I don't. We're expected to be a 
perfectionistic android. This department could go through nine directors. If 
you don't get a better system, it still won't run." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee shouldn't be a scapegoat. He's only carrying out the orders of 
political leaders who hypocritically kiss babies while neglecting children, and 
of taxpayers who scream at abuse but won't pay money to prevent it. But new 
vision and leadership are needed for the department to face the multiple 
challenges of the 1990s, especially the drug-babies crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus' ravaged body is now atrophying; he will end up curled in a little ball. 
He opens his mouth and leans his head back to cry, but no sounds come out. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles will always have children like Jesus and Desire who need 24-hour 
institutionalized care. But it has far too many who are rescued from one kind 
of abuse only to suffer another -- the abuse of neglect by society and its 
government. Taking responsibility for the lives of 120,000 children in 
California's child-welfare system should be the highest calling for public 
officials and private individuals who serve society's stepparent role. 
</P>
<P>
If our county supervisors, our legislators and our governor will not take to 
heart their responsibility for children entrusted to their care, who will?

'PINK RIGHT DOWN TO HER UNDERWEAR'; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE 1950 SENATE CAMPAIGN OF RICHARD NIXON AGAINST HELEN DOUGLAS 
REACHED AN UNEQUALED LOW. COMPARISON IS UNFAIR TO JOHN VAN DE KAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLLEEN M. O'CONNOR, Colleen M. O'Connor is a San Diego historian who has 
written on the Nixon-Douglas race. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California campaign for governor has dredged from political memory the 
infamous Senate race of 1950 between Richard M. Nixon and Helen Gahagan 
Douglas. Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein has compared a television 
ad aired on behalf of her opponent in the Democratic primary, Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, to the smears against Douglas. But what was it like back then? 
</P>
<P>
That 1950 race still ranks as one of the most hate-filled in California -- and 
U.S. -- political history. Nixon's charges against Douglas purposely strayed 
toward character assassination. He questioned her loyalty, her "communist 
sympathies," her Jewish husband's loyalty and her votes in Congress, which were 
printed in the famous "pink sheet" that matched Douglas' "yes" votes with those 
of radical New York Rep. Vito Marcantonio. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's campaign strategist, Murray Chotiner, explained his campaign philosophy 
this way: "The purpose of an election is not to defeat your opponent, but to 
destroy him." 
</P>
<P>
In those frigid days of the Cold War, Nixon not only impugned Douglas' loyalty, 
but called her the Pink Lady, "Pink right down to her underwear." Press 
editorials dubbed Douglas "the darling of the Hollywood Parlour Pinks and 
Reds." 
</P>
<P>
Early versions of Nixon's "dirty tricks" habits were sprinkled throughout the 
campaign. When Douglas appeared on the USC campus, a hay wagon full of 
initiates in the Skull and Dagger fraternity sprayed her with seltzer water and 
doused her with hay. Members of this fraternity turned up later as prominent 
Watergate characters -- Donald Segretti, Gordon C. Strachan, Dwight Chapin and 
Herbert W. Kalmbach. 
</P>
<P>
The infant dirty-tricks campaign against Douglas escalated, with Nixon 
surrogates doing most of the work. Anti-Semite and Nazi sympathizer Gerald L.K. 
Smith toured Los Angeles radio stations exhorting voters to reject this woman 
"who sleeps with a Jew." 
</P>
<P>
A telephone campaign followed. When a voter answered the phone an unidentified 
voice would say, "Did you know that Helen Gahagan Douglas is married to a man 
whose real name is Hesselberg?" Douglas' husband, actor Melvyn Douglas, was the 
Hesselberg in question, having taken a new last name for his career. 
</P>
<P>
In the final weeks of the campaign an estimated 500,000 calls were placed. 
Promises to those who answered included "PRIZES GALORE!!!! Electric Clocks, 
Silex coffeemakers . . . General Electric automatic toastes . . . etc." All 
voters had to do was pick up the phone at the right time. However, when the 
phones did ring, there were no prizes, just anonymous callers who would say, 
"Did you know Helen Gahagan Douglas was a Communist?" and hang up. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon denied asking for any such help and refused responsibility for the 
tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Reeling from the attacks, Douglas said that she felt she "was standing in the 
path of tanks." She remembered the final days of the race: "The worst moment, a 
sight I couldn't shake, was when children picked up rocks and threw them at my 
car, at me." 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the present, Feinstein's charge stems from a Van de Kamp 
commercial holding the San Francisco mayor accountable for shortfalls in the 
city budget and in police and fire protection. Van de Kamp acknowledges tacit 
authorship of, and accepts responsibility for, these ads and airs them in 
public, open for debate. 
</P>
<P>
So for Feinstein to suggest that Van de Kamp's TV commercials are reminiscent 
of Nixon's campaign against Douglas is at best an error in judgment. A darker 
interpretation would be that she is attempting to tar her opponent with "guilt 
by association," a favored Nixon tactic. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Gahagan Douglas, New Deal liberal and the only woman to ever win a 
major-party nomination for the U.S. Senate from California, would cringe if she 
heard Feinstein's accusations, because they are proof that Nixon's campaign 
tactics have become mainstream.

"Consolidate California Sprawl by Regional, Responsible Government" (by Ray 
Remy and Dan Garcia, Opinion, March 25) not only assumes regional and 
responsible are synonymous, but is a rewrite of the SCAG (Southern California 
Assn. of Governments) elitist theology that the people's preference for "a 
detached single family home . . . a private automobile . . . and strong local 
governments" is to be dismissed by bigger-is-better regionalists as "an 
anachronistic collective image of the ideal metropolitan area." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, however, the truth of the matter is that anyone who believes SCAG-like 
governance is preferable to this county's 86 cities, with elective bodies 
responsible to their neighbor-constituents, is indulging in "an anachronistic 
collective image of the ideal" governing mechanism.

1990 CENSUS QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thoroughly enjoyed Frank Clifford's overview of the 1990 census (front page, 
March 24) but was struck by the article's conclusion. Clifford writes: "One 
question on the census long form speaks volumes about old habits at the Census 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
In an age of spas and Jacuzzis and basement lap pools, the census form still 
wants to know if you have indoor plumbing." 
</P>
<P>
The need to include that particular question actually speaks more about the 
growing disparity between the rich and the poor during the 1980s than it does 
about the bureau's old habits. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census will generate a wealth of data, including information on the 
state of the impoverished in our society (despite the inevitable undercount of 
this population). The lack of indoor plumbing is common in areas such as rural 
Texas. Hopefully, this same information will encourage policy-makers to correct 
this situation, making the question obsolete by the time census 2000 rolls 
around.

<P>
I'm mad as hell, but don't know who or where to write to express my complaint 
about the census. This marks the third time in the last three censuses that I 
have not been sent a form to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
I feel I haven't been counted. The first time was in 1970 in San Francisco, the 
second time was in 1980 in Los Angeles and now the same thing in 1990. I also 
never had anyone knock on my door to ask me census questions either. 
</P>
<P>
I've always lived in Skid Row hotels, as I do now. I've had a private mailbox 
address in Hollywood since 1975. I also had one in San Francisco. None of my 
friends who live in downtown Ski Row hotels got census forms either. We feel 
the census is discriminating against us because we're poor and live in Skid Row 
hotels. We want to know why we weren't sent census forms and why we weren't 
counted or contacted!

1990 CENSUS QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had a peculiar experience in attempting to fill out the census questionnaire. 
I came to the question concerning the race of my children and frankly did not 
know how to answer it. 
</P>
<P>
Since the instructions state that one bubble only should be filled in according 
to the race a person considers themselves to be, I finally resorted to asking 
them point blank. The absurdity of the question was immediately apparent to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
I am half Swedish, one-quarter English, one-eighth French, and one-eighth 
German. When I fill out the census questionnaire about myself, I have no 
problem. I am easily able to fill in the bubble labeled "white," because 
Europeans, Scandinavians, Slavics, or any other light-skinned persons have been 
allowed to "melt" into the American culture. 
</P>
<P>
My husband is a pure-blooded Asian Indian. He has no problem filling out the 
census form because he is an immigrant from India. Theoretically, my children 
are the next generation to "melt" into the American culture. What race are 
they? When I asked my two daughters about their race, why cannot they answer 
"American!" with pride? Why must a bureaucratic government insist on breaking 
down what could be a united country into artificial categories called race? 
</P>
<P>
Although the brochure enclosed with the questionnaire lists several reasons for 
the census, I fail to see how race can have a bearing on funding for programs, 
services, schools, etc.

DODGERS RUN, ANGELS STUMBLE INTO OPENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The important thing, as any baseball fan will tell you, is that today both 
teams are 0-0. 
</P>
<P>
Their exhibition records have been rendered meaningless. Spring training is 
officially finished, if not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
But cliches are one thing and appearances are another. And it was hard not to 
notice Sunday at Dodger Stadium that the Dodgers and Angels are entering 1990s 
opening day at vastly different gaits. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who defeated the Angels, 4-2, to sweep the three-game Freeway 
Series for the fourth time in 21 years, are sprinting. They won six of their 
last seven exhibition games. Their rebuilt offense scored fewer than four runs 
just twice in the 12-game spring season, during which they finished 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
And for a bunch of old guys, they are fairly healthy. With the exception of 
Kirk Gibson, their opening day lineup against the San Diego Padres at Dodger 
Stadium at 1:35 p.m. today is just as they envisioned it last January. 
</P>
<P>
This includes Kal Daniels playing left field, and starter Orel Hershiser 
showing scant effects of the shortened spring training. Hershiser threw 80 
pitches in his last workout Thursday and could translate that into as many as 
eight innings today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are already having fun again," said catcher Rick Dempsey, whose bloop 
double and two RBIs Sunday led the Dodgers. "We feel like we're jelling just in 
time. We're getting all that old enthusiasm back." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are stumbling, having lost their last seven exhibition games. On 
Sunday it was announced they had lost their starting third baseman for at least 
a couple of days. Jack Howell's sprained left ankle will not be ready for 
tonight's 6 game in Anaheim against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
With shortstop Dick Schofield already on the disabled list, the left side of 
the infield likely will feature backups Mark McLemore and Donnie Hill. And 
Chili Davis' groin soreness could keep him out of the starting lineup. None of 
this would be so bad if the Angel pitchers hadn't accumulated a spring earned 
run average of 6.28. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Manager Doug Rader is the least bit worried. 
</P>
<P>
"What have we lost?" Rader responded when asked about the spring losing streak. 
"We've lost seven exhibition games. The games start tomorrow . . . I don't see 
anything wrong with the effort or competitiveness of our ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels competed well Sunday until three Dodger doubles in a four-batter 
stretch in the fourth inning against starter and loser Jim Abbott broke a 1-1 
tie. Jeff Hamilton doubled to left field, Mike Scioscia doubled to right to 
score him and -- one out later -- Dempsey blooped a double down the left field 
line, dropping it between Wally Joyner, Kent Anderson and Claudell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It was more than enough runs for Dodger starter Ramon Martinez, who was let off 
the hook by an Angel offense that couldn't capitalize on five walks in four 
innings. Kirk McCaskill was given three innings of work, and, of the Angels' 
six hits against five Dodger pitchers, one was by him. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm going to say is that competing against the pitching staffs of the 
Padres and Dodgers, I can understand our lack of offense," Rader said, 
referring to earlier spring losses to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest Dodger worry appears to be the health of reliever Jay Howell, who 
this weekend reported shoulder stiffness after throwing four scoreless innings 
with four strikeouts in Florida. Howell threw on the side Sunday, and the 
Dodgers will know more about his availability this morning. 
</P>
<P>
If Howell cannot go for a couple of days, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda will have 
extra right-handed relievers Don Aase and Mike Hartley at his disposal, due to 
the 27-man expanded rosters. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda is already at midseason form, setting a pair of Angel pitcher Bert 
Blyleven's shoes on fire in front of the dugout after the sixth inning Sunday. 
It was revenge for the pie Blyleven shoved in Lasorda's face Friday while the 
Dodger manager was doing a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, our enthusiasm and teamwork seems great, even better than going 
into last season," Mickey Hatcher observed about the Dodgers. "Of course, you 
never know. But we can't wait." 
</P>
<P>
Angel-Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Mike Morgan will begin the season in the starting rotation. Dodger 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski confirmed Sunday that Morgan would start Friday 
in Houston, and John Wetteland would begin the season in the bullpen. That, of 
course, could change in a couple of weeks. "Both guys are capable, but Mike is 
a little more experienced. He had the great first half last year, and we felt 
we would go with that," Perranoski said. "But John is an important member of 
the staff, and you never know what happens down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hartley became the final Dodger to learn he made the team Sunday, but in a 
most unusual way. After spending a sleepless Saturday night worrying about his 
status, he walked up to pitching coach Perranoski and volunteered to pitch in 
the Freeway Series finale. "He told me I wouldn't be pitching today, because 
they needed me ready for Monday," Hartley said. "I said, 'Does this mean I made 
the team?' He said, 'You don't know?' Then they called me in and talked to me 
about it." Hartley is one of four players filling expanded roster spots -- 
three spots due to the spring-training lockout and one vacated by disabled 
pitcher Jim Gott. The three other fill-ins are pitchers Don Aase and Mike Munoz 
and outfielder John Shelby. Munoz and Aase were two of the Dodgers with former 
big-league experience who have had a full six weeks of spring training during 
the lockout because the Dodgers, unlike other big league teams, allowed their 
non-roster former big leaguers to work with the minor leaguers at the annual 
mini-camp. "As it turns out, that was a blessing for me," Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger opening day batting order against San Diego's left-handed starter 
Bruce Hurst: Juan Samuel, Willie Randolph, Hubie Brooks, Eddie Murray, Kal 
Daniels, Jeff Hamilton, Mike Scioscia, Alfredo Griffin, Orel Hershiser. Look 
for the left-handed hitting Daniels to bat third against right-handers, with 
Brooks moving behind Murray . . . Angel pitcher Bob McClure, suffering from an 
inflamed left elbow, has shown some improvement but might be placed on the 
disabled list pending an examination today . . . Catcher Bill Schroeder, who 
was placed on the 15-day disabled Saturday, has an inflamed right elbow, the 
same elbow which was surgically repaired last September. Rookie John Orton will 
take his place on the opening day roster.

GREEN IS RED HOT FOR LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times, Laker forward A.C. Green drove the lane as fast and reckless as a New 
York cab driver. He was drawn to missed shots like a heat-seeking missile. 
Defensively, he did not let his man free. 
</P>
<P>
On top of all that, his outside shooting simply left Denver Nugget players 
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Green was everywhere, and was the biggest of several reasons why the Lakers 
pulled out a 116-109 victory Sunday evening over the Nuggets to further 
distance themselves from the Detroit Pistons in the race for the NBA's best 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at center because of Mychal Thompson's hyper-extended right knee, 
Green responded with 26 points, a career-high 18 rebounds and had a hand in 
repelling Nugget comeback attempts in the final minutes. Green's turnaround 
17-foot jump shot with 57 seconds to play, heaved just to avoid a 24-second 
clock violation, put Nugget hopes to rest for good. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' sixth straight victory might have ended the Pistons' hope of 
finishing with the league's best record and home-court advantage throughout the 
playoffs. The Lakers (57-17), who have eight games to left, lead the Pistons 
(54-21) by four games in the loss column. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for Green, as well as strong bench play, the Lakers might not 
be in quite so good a position entering the regular season's final two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That Green was a force against the Nuggets is not surprising. Denver's 
philosophy is to trap and double team Magic Johnson and James Worthy and, well, 
everybody except Green. And, just as he did in Denver two months ago, Green had 
a big night. 
</P>
<P>
Left free to roam the perimeter, wander the key and crash the boards, Green 
scored four baskets inside of five feet, made three perimeter jump shots, and 
even sank a baseline hook and had an above-the-rim tip-in. 
</P>
<P>
Green was not alone in turning back the Nuggets, now only a half game ahead of 
Seattle for the eighth and final playoff spot. Worthy scored 21 of his 29 
points in the first half and finished with nine assists. Johnson had 19 points 
and 11 rebounds. Vlade Divac, playing 26 minutes because of Thompson's absence, 
had 14 points and six rebounds. And Michael Cooper, starting at forward, 
limited Alex English to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Nuggets had to select a Laker to ignore, it was Green. And, they 
paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still people in this league who think A.C. can't shoot outside," 
Riley said. "A.C. is an effort player, and you have to have effort players when 
you play Denver. Their passing game and their trapping defense leaves a lot of 
open seams and lanes for A.C. to go. No one blocks him out and A.C. always 
makes the effort to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Green says he does not play any differently against the Nuggets than any other 
team. He insisted he does not especially look forward to playing against the 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just the way they defend us," Green said. "We're a team blessed 
with such talent that they can't play everyone one-on-one. They got to leave 
somebody open." 
</P>
<P>
Green said he did not feel particularly potent offensively. He said his jump 
shot felt a little awkward and said he was affected early by the high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept trying to get a hand on the ball," Green said. "I tried to give 
the best effort I could." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said for Green's teammates. While the Pistons are slumping 
without guard Joe Dumars, the Lakers overcame the loss of Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real great game for us," Riley said. "We went dead in the water for 
about three or four minutes in the third quarter. But we played 44 minutes of 
great basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Against the Nuggets, that proved enough. But Riley admitted to being a tad 
concerned during the Lakers' lone lull, which hit in the final 3:40 of the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets hit stride with a 16-4 run, as the Laker offense unaccountably 
segued into disarray. The Lakers had four turnovers, missed two easy shots and 
Byron Scott did not even draw iron on a three-point attempt. Their lone basket 
came on a Worthy jumper with 1:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
So, an 83-74 lead turned into a 90-85 deficit entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Green and Johnson, who sat out most of the third-quarter drought, returned at 
the start of the fourth quarter. So, too, did the Lakers' composure. It took 
then slightly less than four minutes to regain the lead and, every time the 
Nuggets threatened, the Lakers responded with big baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Green scored eight of the Lakers' last 12 points and, consequently, Denver 
could get no closer than seven points. 
</P>
<P>
One of Green's most impressive efforts came with 3:40 to play. Orlando 
Woolridge missed a shot, then Magic Johnson missed a three-point shot, then 
Woolridge missed another follow attempt. Green found position underneath and 
tipped in Woolridge's second miss. Green later sank four free throws, leading 
to his turnaround jumper that put the Nuggets to rest.

GRETZKY RETURNS; KINGS EDGE FLAMES IN OVERTIME; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: GRANATO SCORES SHORT-HANDED GOAL AT 8:37 TO GIVE L.A. A 
TWO-GAMES-TO-ONE PLAYOFF LEAD OVER CALGARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky's back is back. 
</P>
<P>
And so are the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally buoyed by Wayne Gretzky's return to the lineup, the Kings edged the 
Calgary Flames at the Forum, 2-1, on Tony Granato's short-handed overtime goal 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings lead the best-of-seven series, two games to one. 
</P>
<P>
Granato's goal came 8:37 into the extra period after he intercepted a pass from 
Gary Suter at mid-ice. 
</P>
<P>
"The puck was bouncing in the neutral zone," Granato said. "I knew it was going 
to be a tough angle." 
</P>
<P>
Granato cut the angle down, skating to within a few feet of goalie Mike Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Then he fired a rising shot, the puck sailing over Vernon's glove into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to shoot it between his legs," Granato said, "but it just wasn't 
there. Fortunately, I found room on the short side." 
</P>
<P>
Granato's heroics shifted the spotlight from Gretzky's return before a sellout 
crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen days after leaving the ice because of a hyper-extended back, and only 
two days after resuming practice, Gretzky skated back into the Forum to a 
reception fit for a king. 
</P>
<P>
There had been erroneous reports of Gretzky sightings for a week in Canada, but 
the Flames finally spotted him in the last place they wanted to see him, on the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to play this morning," Gretzky said. "There had been so 
much talk about my playing. I told the team I was going to play yesterday 
(Saturday) and today. So I felt if I didn't play, it was going to be a little 
bit of a downer. I was determined to play a little." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky quickly made it clear that that he was out there to be more than a 
cheerleader on skates. 
</P>
<P>
Barely into his first shift, Gretzky stole the puck from Brian MacLellan in the 
Calgary zone and passed to Tomas Sandstrom coming in from the left side. 
Sandstrom was unable to convert, but the message was delivered: The greatest 
point-producer in NHL history was back in business. 
</P>
<P>
He still looked tentative at times in the first period, his full range of 
motion appearing limited. 
</P>
<P>
But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
By the second period, he looked like, well, Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
He set up his team's goal after coming down the right side and faking a shot. 
Instead, Gretzky slipped the puck to Rob Blake, whose shot was blocked by 
Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
The puck came back to Gretzky in the right corner. He centered it for 
Sandstrom, who directed it past Vernon's stick into the left corner of the net 
23 seconds into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
It was Sandstrom's first goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before Gretzky was injured, Coach Tom Webster was finally able to 
put together the line he had envisioned when Bernie Nicholls was traded to the 
New York Rangers for Granato and Sandstrom. 
</P>
<P>
But immediately after the trade, first Granato, then Sandstrom were injured. 
</P>
<P>
But for three games in March, Granato and Sandstrom played on either side of 
Gretzky. The result: eight goals, 14 assists and three victories, all on the 
road, against the New York Rangers, Buffalo and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was Gretzky's turn to disappear, first because of a strained groin 
muscle, then the back problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the playoffs, the line, with Chris Kontos subbing for Gretzky, had produced 
only one point before Sunday, on a power-play goal by Granato. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames tied the score with 5:55 remaining in regulation. Theoren Fleury's 
shot from the slot was blocked by goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
The puck bounced back to MacLellan, who spun around and passed it to Joe Mullen 
behind him, coming down the slot. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the puck sailed past Hrudey to set up the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams squandered numerous opportunities, the Flames failing on all nine of 
their power plays, the Kings on all seven. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Gretzky was asked how the back felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little sore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But not as sore as the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Al MacInnis left after the second period because of a sore knee and 
didn't return. His NHL playoff scoring streak ended at 19 games, tying him with 
Wayne Gretzky for the second longest such streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings escaped Calgary with a split, but they didn't escape the wrath of the 
Calgary Sun. The paper had some fun with the team with several biting cartoons. 
One showed a glacier behind the net moving faster than the Kings' defensemen. 
Another depicted Marty McSorley filling his head with cement in preparation for 
the playoffs. A third had a figure holding up a Bernie Nicholls' jersey, 
suggesting him to General Manager Rogie Vachon as a possible replacement for 
the injured Wayne Gretzky.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE SHOWED UP LATE BECAUSE HE HAD PRESSING PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever a player from the Dominican Republic is late for spring training, the 
patented excuse is that he had visa problems. Baltimore's Jay Bell, brother of 
Toronto's George Bell, has come up with a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer when Bell finally reported a week ago Thursday: 
"He told the Orioles he couldn't leave before then because his wife had sent 
all of his clothes to the cleaners." 
</P>
<P>
Gearing up: From ESPN's Chris Berman, who will step out of the studio to call 
today's Dodger-Padre game (blacked out in L.A.): "It'll be like driving a 
stick-shift car. I haven't driven one in 10 years, but I'll be able to find the 
clutch." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What college has had three 70-foot shotputters? 
</P>
<P>
What a kid: At the Loyola Marymount basketball banquet, Paul Westhead said of 
Paul Westhead Jr., who served as a third assistant coach this season: "He came 
up to me after our success this year and said, 'Dad, last year you had the same 
players, the same staff and ran the same system. So I guess the only real 
difference was me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Westhead: Of departing seniors Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, he said, "They 
took more shots than most teams. Correction, Jeff took more shots than most 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
More Westhead: As for next season, he said, "Well, for starters, we lose 87 
points a game from three players, but then, as you might imagine, we've got 
lots of players with lots of shots they are just waiting to get up." 
</P>
<P>
From the baseball bible: From Moss Klein's 1990 forecast in the Sporting News: 
"California's Mark Langston will have a decent year, probably in the 17-9 range 
with a lot of strikeouts, but Chuck Finley will be the best left-hander in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
No sweat: From Philadelphia's Charles Barkley, shrugging off Friday night's 
114-104 loss to New York: "We don't have to worry about facing them again, 
because if you know anything about sports, they won't get by Boston in the 
first round." 
</P>
<P>
No tears: From Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun, noting that the Indianapolis 
Colts are getting little sympathy as they wrestle with the Eric Dickerson 
problem: "When General Manager Jim Irsay said Dickerson's complaints were a 
slap in the face to the fans, Bob Ley of ESPN said, 'Jim Irsay talking about 
fans. Just thought you fans in Baltimore would like to hear that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Texas A&amp;M. Mike Stulce threw 70-6 1/4 indoors to join Randy 
Matson (71-5 1/2) and Randy Barnes (71-9 1/2) as Aggie 70-footers. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: San Francisco Manager Roger Craig, asked if the pot belly that 
shortstop Jose Uribe added over the winter has affected his range: "No, but it 
takes him a little longer to tie his shoes." HARLEY TINKHAM

JET STREAM CATCHES UP WITH OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After taking one playoff beating after another over the years from the Edmonton 
Oilers, the Winnipeg Jets are finally fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to make any difference whether it was a best-of-five series or 
best-of-seven, the Oilers always won. They won five series with the loss of 
only one game, while winning 18. Some of the games weren't even contests. 
</P>
<P>
Center Dale Hawerchuk suffered through the humiliating string of defeats. 
</P>
<P>
There was a little extra satisfaction for Hawerchuk Sunday night at Winnipeg 
when he scored with 4:30 left in regulation to give the Jets a 2-1 victory and 
a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-year veteran intercepted a clearing pass in the Oilers' zone and fired 
a quick 20-foot wrist shot, from which goaltender Bill Ranford was screened, 
for his third goal of the series. 
</P>
<P>
With Grant Fuhr still unavailable, Ranford was back in the nets for Edmonton. 
He stopped 28 shots, but was under heavy pressure much more than the Jets' 
netminder Bob Essena, who faced only two shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We were determined to make a better showing this time," Hawerchuk said. "If 
Ranford had not played extremely well, we would have won easily. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, we are playing so well because we remember the alternative. Last year 
we had a terrible season and watched it on television. I didn't enjoy it at 
all. I would rather lose to the Oilers than not be in the playoffs at all." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who did not make it past the first round last year, their first 
season without Wayne Gretzky, scored first. Reijo Routsalainen scored on a 
power play at 16:35 of the first period. The Oilers had only nine more shots on 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Toronto 5 -- Of all the teams going into the playoffs, the Blues 
were playing the worst. They lost seven of their last eight games to fall out 
of first place in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Sergio Momesso took a pass from Brett Hull at 6:04 of overtime at 
Toronto and scored on a slapshot from the blue line, the Blues became the first 
team to take a 3-0 series lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues appeared to have the game won in regulation when Momesso's first goal 
of the series made it 5-3 midway through the last period. But Rob Ramage scored 
with 2:52 remaining and Tom Fergus tied it with 70 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs, who outshot the Blues, 46-40, had three shots in the overtime 
before Alan Bester stopped a breakaway by Hull. The Leafs never got the puck 
out of their zone before Momesso won it. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues, who lost seven of their eight games against the Maple Leafs during 
the regular season, can wrap up the opening round with a victory Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Minnesota 1 -- Steve Larmer scored halfway through the third period 
at Bloomington, Minn., and the Blackhawks took a 2-1 series lead. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars thought they tied it 90 seconds after Larmer scored, but 
referee Bill McCreary ruled the puck never crossed the goal line on Dave 
Gagner's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Millen, yanked by Coach Mike Keenan when he gave up three goals in the 
first period in the second game, was back in the nets for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped 31 shots in a near flawless performance. He lost his shutout after 
Wayne Presley's backhander gave him a 2-0 lead with 4:33 left. There were only 
36 seconds remaining when Mike Modano knocked in a rebound.

As Nancy Brown started play Sunday, she led the Red Robin Kyocera Inamori golf 
tournament after three rounds for the second consecutive year. She finished 
play still looking for her first LPGA victory after shooting a five-over-par 76 
and opening the way for Kris Monaghan to win her first LPGA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan, 29, shot an eight-under 276 to win $45,000. She had five birdies and 
shot 31 on the front nine, then added two birdies on the back nine to finish 
with a four-under 67. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Gerring -- who also has never won an LPGA tournament -- was two strokes 
back at 278 and earned $27,750. Rosie Jones and Ayako Okamoto were three back 
and won $18,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Brown finished in a tie for seventh at three-under 281. Last year, she had a 
two-stroke lead after three rounds and shot a seven-over 78 to fall into a tie 
for 17th. 
</P>
<P>
She started Sunday eight under but was taken off the leader board after a front 
nine score of 42 that included three bogeys and double-bogeys on the eighth and 
ninth holes. 
</P>
<P>
She said she tried to steer the ball with a nine-iron on her drive to the 
eighth hole and got a bad lie. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared on nine," she said. "I thought, 'Great, what am I going to do 
today?' " 
</P>
<P>
What she was going to do was get two birdies on the back side but it was too 
late. At that point, what mattered was what Monaghan was going to do. She 
started the day tied with Gerring at four-under, but birdied the fifth, sixth, 
eighth, ninth and 11th holes to get to nine-under. She was interrupted briefly 
with a bogey on 13, but birdied 15 to put her back at nine-under. She bogeyed 
18, but, by that time, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
The two strokes she will remember came on the 11th and 15th holes. 
</P>
<P>
On 11, she made a 25-foot putt that snaked up the crest for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"When that went in, I was feeling a little unconscious," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was nothing compared to her birdie on 15, which came when she made a 
30-foot shot by chipping out of the right front bunker. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of shot that you dream about to win a tourney," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She shot a one-over 72 Thursday but came back with a 67 Friday. She said she 
figured her most difficult task would be following Friday's round. She overcame 
that challenge with a 70 Saturday, setting the stage for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to stay patient and consistent today," she said. "Two big words that 
are almost new to my vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan, in her sixth year on the tour, had missed the cut in four of five 
tournaments this year and tied for 39th in the Desert Inn LPGA Invitational 
March 11 in Las Vegas. Her career best finish was fourth in the Safeco 
tournament in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
She made more money Sunday than she ever has in a year. Previously, her 
career-best year was 1987, when she earned $21,937. 
</P>
<P>
She had earned just $2,052 this year on the tour. The $45,000 winner's check 
will help. 
</P>
<P>
"You have no idea how important that is," she said. "I've struggled with money 
ever since I've been out here. This makes my whole career. Winning is what it 
is all about, but the money is nice, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Money has always been a problem -- I've never had very much of it. It's been a 
concern, but I've tried not to dwell on it. I'm not going to tell you how small 
my bank account is." 
</P>
<P>
She stays in private housing so she can save money when she is on tour. She 
doesn't insist on high-priced, professional caddies. This weekend, her caddie 
was Robert Delgado, a senior on the San Diego State golf team. She walked into 
the caddie shack one day earlier this week, said she didn't want a tour caddie, 
and Delgado happened to be standing there. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that amazed me about her every day," Delgado said, "was that nothing 
mattered to her -- who she was playing with, what she was wearing, what balls 
she was using. There were no superstitions." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado wasn't the only one impressed with Monaghan. Okamoto, who played in 
Monaghan's threesome, hugged her when they finished. Jones hung around the 18th 
green long enough to congratulate Monaghan as well. Jones and Monaghan are both 
from Albuquerque, N.M., and played junior golf against each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really proud of Kris," Jones said. "What I know of Kris and what she has 
inside of her, I think this is just the beginning.

HORSEWOMAN CONNIE RING, 91, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connie Ring, who bred and raced top horses in California for more than 40 
years, died Friday at Good Samaritan Hospital, where she was a patient for two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Ring, 91, bought her first horse in 1947, paying $3,500 for a sore-legged 
animal who never won a race and earned only $130. But that was the start of a 
long love affair with racing that peaked in 1977, when Crystal Water, a horse 
she bred, became the first horse to sweep the Santa Anita Handicap, the 
Californian and the Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Water, who ran with suspect ankles, later won the Oak Tree Invitational 
at Santa Anita, beating Ancient Title and Vigors, and he was retired with 
earnings of $845,072 -- one of the highest totals ever registered by a 
California-bred. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Water's forte was grass. 
</P>
<P>
"If he ran in a different era, he would have earned $2 million as a grass 
horse," Ring once said. "He would have taken horses like John Henry and made 
them look sick. I had a lot of respect for John Henry, but Crystal Water was 
just fabulous on grass." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Ring's standouts was Olympiad King, whom she bought for $16,500. In 
1963, Olympiad King won four stakes, including a division of the Del Mar Derby, 
and earned more than $100,000. He went on to a successful career as a stallion, 
standing at Ring's 200-acre Three Rings Farm in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Windy Sands, who was Crystal Water's sire, was California's leading stallion in 
1976, 1977, 1981, 1982 and 1983. Ring bred 36 stakes winners. 
</P>
<P>
Ring employed only six trainers, including Jack Phillips, who trained Olympiad 
King, and Roger Clapp, who was Crystal Water's conditioner. For many years, she 
had a custom of buying her trainers a drink before her horse ran, and to also 
join the trainer for a drink afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Ring was born in Memphis, Tenn., and after she moved to California with 
her mother she became a secretary for George Ring, whom she later married. 
Ring, who died in 1957, owned the Ring Oil Co. After his death, estate costs 
forced Ring to choose between the oil company and the racing stable, and she 
kept the horses. 
</P>
<P>
George Ring didn't approve when his wife bought her first horse, especially 
when he saw the condition of the animal. When Ring told her husband that their 
stable name would be Three Rings -- one ring for each of them and a ring 
representing the horse -- George Ring said: "Just make it two rings. I don't 
want to have anything to do with the business." 
</P>
<P>
But the same year she bought that first horse, George Ring bought her two more 
horses for her birthday, including a yearling filly that cost $46,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no children or relatives," Ring said in an interview in 1982. "But I 
have my horses and all my friends that I've made as the result of those 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
Ring sold her horses and her farm at the end of 1988. In her will, she 
requested that there be no funeral service. She asked that her body be cremated 
and the ashes be scattered over the mountains.

STEINLEN WINS EL RINCON HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the three races Wayne Lukas won Sunday at Santa Anita, it was the least 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Still, 1989 Eclipse Award winner Steinlen did what he was supposed to in his 
second start as a 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
The 125-pound highweight and even-money favorite in the $108,900 El Rincon 
Handicap, Steinlen beat Bruho by a head while covering the mile in 1:33 2/5. 
While the time was a stakes record, it should be noted that Miami Dan, who was 
one for 17 before Sunday, had gone 1:34 in winning the fifth race. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven victories ahead of Brian Mayberry and Richard Mandella in the Santa 
Anita trainer standings after earlier victories by On A Roll and Profit Key, 
Lukas was satisfied with his champion's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't too artistic, but he got the job done," he said after the Habitat 
horse's 18th victory in 37 lifetime starts boosted his earnings to more than 
$2.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes him a couple of races to get his act together. If you remember, he 
ran a couple of sub-par races, then took off. 
</P>
<P>
"He bled just a little last time. We scoped to find it and we found a few 
flakes, so we put him on Lasix as a precautionary thing, but I don't think he's 
going to be a horse that needs it. I like to run them on it for a couple of 
races, then get them off it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather give the credit (for the improvement) to the horse coming into 
form. That's a good second effort for him -- 1:33 2/5. That wasn't an easy 
race, but I'll bet he improves off this one." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos, who was aboard for Steinlen's victories in the Arlington Million 
and Breeders' Cup Mile and two other '89 successes, also feels the horse will 
move forward. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt a lot better today, but I don't think he's 100% yet," said Santos, who 
arrived from Florida Saturday night and left for New York Sunday evening. "When 
I rode him last time (when he finished seventh in the Arcadia Handicap March 
4), he felt heavy and was kind of lazy. He broke from there, ran a half-mile 
and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
"The race set up perfect for him today. He had a little trouble at the 
five-sixteenths pole, but when I got clear, it looked like he was going to win 
by two. He started getting a little tired in the last sixteenth of a mile, but 
I got after him and he won." 
</P>
<P>
Nine days after he went wire-to-wire against allowance rivals, Bruho hopped in 
the air at the start and was away last, then tried to come back on after 
Steinlen pulled ahead. The poor start had trainer Julio Canani seething and the 
object of his rage was starter Tucker Slender. 
</P>
<P>
"That . . . cost me the race," he said. "(Bruho) wasn't even set yet and the 
gates were opened. There's only six horses in the race, so what's the hurry?" 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens wasn't willing to single out the start for the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't set when the gate opened," he said. "He was stepping back to set 
himself when the gate opened. But I don't blame the loss on that. I was 
satisfied with his position. 
</P>
<P>
"But, down the backside, Wonder Dancer (the longest shot in the field at 35-1) 
kept coming out and bumping me. Bruho ran a powerful race. He was trying to 
come back again and that's an Eclipse Award winner who beat me. He dug in when 
Steinlen came up to him." 
</P>
<P>
Wonder Dancer was third, five lengths behind Bruho, then came Santangelo, Music 
Merci, and Shining Steel. 
</P>
<P>
Victorious for the first time in this country when he was taken off the pace 
and allowed to run late, Shining Steel ran off early Sunday and paid for it in 
the final furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get him under any cover on the first turn and he tried to take 
off," said jockey Robbie Davis of the 4-year-old Kris S. colt, who is owned by 
Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky. "In the other races, I was able to tuck him in 
and he relaxed fine. He'll settle on the bit once he relaxes behind horses." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa worked a mile in 1:37 2/5 Sunday morning preparing for her rematch with 
Gorgeous in the Apple Blossom Handicap April 18. There's a possibility the race 
will be simulcast at Santa Anita. . . . Silver Ending, who will run in the 
Arkansas Derby April 21, worked the same distance in 1:39 for trainer Ron 
McAnally. . . . Perfect in two starts as a 3-year-old after finishing second in 
both of his appearances at Del Mar, Profit Key will race next in the Debonair 
Stakes, the opening day feature at Hollywood Park April 25. This would pit him 
against Thirty Slews, the unbeaten son of Slewpy. "I've never seen Gary 
(Stevens) as high on a horse as he is on that one," said trainer Wayne Lukas 
after Profit Key beat a troubled Jacodra by 2 1/2 lengths in 1:10. Profit Key 
is a son of Desert Wine and is a half-brother to Vinnie The Viper.

GOP Support: Former First Lady Betty Ford joined several other Republicans 
recently in Washington, D.C., to announce the creation of Pro-Choice America, a 
group that will support GOP candidates who oppose President George Bush's 
anti-abortion stance. The committee spokesperson said the group's only purpose 
was to support "pro-choice Republicans who face anti-choice opponents."

Trump Label: Ivana Trump, whose estranged husband, Donald, said he paid her $1 
a year and all the dresses she wanted for running New York's Plaza Hotel, plans 
to launch her own collections of ready-to-wear clothing and accessories in 
1992, Women's Wear Daily reported. Trump said she was negotiating with "a major 
licensing company," which she wouldn't name, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor's Move: At the National Black Mayors Conference in New Orleans last week, 
Washington Mayor Marion Barry walked in during a speech by Jesse Jackson, who 
said: "Come on up here, Mr. Mayor." Barry approached the dais and the crowd 
stood and applauded. Then Jackson returned to excoriating President Bush's war 
on drugs as a colossal failure. Barry, arrested in January on drug charges, did 
not speak.

Wait Training: Florence Griffith Joyner, the heroine of the 1988 Olympics, is 
expecting her first child in November, her business agent said Thursday. "She 
was delighted to hear the news," Gordon Baskin said in New York. Griffith 
Joyner won three gold medals and a silver medal in track events at the Seoul 
Games. Her husband is Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple 
jump.

JACK SMITH: PLANT A TREE, FOR DOOMSDAY WILL SOON BE UPON US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other day I answered the doorbell to find two women members of Jehovah's 
Witnesses on my porch. They were elderly kindly and seemed concerned only for 
my soul. 
</P>
<P>
I assured them that I was beyond redemption and that if the world did indeed 
come to an end, I could not hope to be among the chosen few who would ascend to 
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
More in pity than in anger, they walked backward down the steps, shaking their 
heads at my intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
But their visit had its effect. It reminded me that it had been some time since 
I had checked my Doomsday file. This is a file of clippings I keep on the 
subject of the end of the world and how it will probably come about, whether by 
fire or by ice. 
</P>
<P>
In going through it, I found that even in very recent years, the scenario has 
kept changing. As scientists make new discoveries about the cosmos and the 
history of our tiny planet, they keep rewriting the last act. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the idea that the world would end in nuclear fusion, or in the 
nuclear winter to follow, has lost probability with the end of the Cold War and 
the easing of tension between democracy and communism. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years it seemed probable that we would blow ourselves up, thus denying 
the inevitable natural forces their part in the game. Though diminished, that 
threat has not gone. As long as there are stockpiles of nuclear bombs, the 
danger remains. Any nut might get hold of one. One 2-megaton nuclear warhead 
has the explosive equivalence of all the bombs exploded in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
At least one religious group in Montana is not reassured. That is the Church 
Universal and Triumphant, whose leader has predicted a nuclear war sometime 
this month and decreed that the church's people should go underground. This 
prospect does not appeal to its teen-agers, several of whom have rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
Cockeyed as this defensive strategy may seem to us more sensible folk, let us 
remember that not long ago our own political leaders were advocating it with a 
straight face. T.K. Jones, President Reagan's deputy undersecretary of defense, 
told us: "Dig a hole, cover it with a couple of doors and then throw three feet 
of dirt on top. . . . If there are enough shovels to go around, everybody's 
going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Just recently, scientists concluded that periodically through the Earth's 
history, almost all life has been destroyed by the effects of an asteroid 
striking Earth. A large asteroid falling into the sea would generate enough 
steam to boil everyone on Earth alive, like so many lobsters. That may be what 
happened to the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
In Charles Panati's "Extraordinary Endings of Practically Everything and 
Everybody" (Harper &amp; Row), he says that at least 99% of all species that 
ever lived on Earth are extinct. He observes that mass catastrophes have 
occurred about every 30 million years. The last big one was the Cretaceous 
Extinction of 65 million years ago, which exterminated the dinosaurs (which did 
not coexist with man). 
</P>
<P>
In the Pleistocene Extinction, only 10,000 years ago, about 50% of animal 
species disappeared worldwide; in the Americas, about 67%. Keeping in mind that 
these catastrophes occur about every 30 million years, it seems to me we ought 
to keep an asteroid watch, rather than worry about the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
We have been hearing for years that the greenhouse effect, in which the cloud 
of carbon dioxide produced by humans is causing the climate to warm, will 
inevitably melt the icecaps and flood coastal cities, causing all sorts of 
havoc otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest findings of meteorologists is that the climate is not warming; 
they warn, however, that we must still suppress our output of carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
All these dangers may seem far in the future (although that periodic 
catastrophe may be imminent), but the environmentalists are right. We must take 
steps now to save our planet. Any day now it may be too late. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later we'll have to give up our automobiles, quit chopping down our 
rain forests, practice birth control, quit burning fossil fuels and quit using 
up our resources for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, why don't we concentrate our technological skills on how to divert 
an asteroid that's headed toward us, instead of spending ourselves into 
bankruptcy on Star Wars? 
</P>
<P>
And why doesn't everybody plant a tree?

'ILLUSION' WEAVES A SPELL AT LATC;

<P>
STAGE: TONY KUSHNER DEFTLY ADAPTS A YOUTHFUL CORNEILLE'S SATIRE AT L.A. THEATRE 
CENTER.

<P>
What are the real powers of sorcery? To alter? To define? To transport? Tony 
Kushner and Pierre Corneille before him go for all three, which is only part of 
the magic in Kushner's fanciful adaptation of Corneille's "The Illusion" 
("L'Illusion Comique") that opened Saturday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Freely adapted it is, in the best sense. For Corneille, whose later, loftier 
verse plays earned him the stodgy title of Father of French Tragedy, "The 
Illusion" was a mildly satirical precursor to all that -- a glitch, written 
when he was only 29. Yet, even then, it was burdened by a ponderous 
17th-Century neo-classical style that kept the word comique out of 20th-Century 
range. Kushner's achievement is digging under all the circumlocution to salvage 
an ageless and universal idea, stripping the nugget of its ornamentation and 
serving it up to us lingually lucid and lean. 
</P>
<P>
There is some colloquial indulgence in the rewritten language, but it's mostly 
judicious. We're in on the joke, which never goes too far. Simply put, this is 
the tale of a rigid father, Pridamant (Alan Mandell), who, stricken with 
remorse for having provoked his son to flee the family home, searches out the 
magician Alcandre (an androgynous Mary Woronov) in the hope that he will help 
him find out what happened to the wayward boy. 
</P>
<P>
Alcandre does, and the ironic twist of the piece is that after several false 
starts, passionate re-enactments, comic delusions and confusions, the truth is 
revealed and Papa finds he doesn't like it. The lighthearted ending is a 
cynical but honest lesson in selective affection. 
</P>
<P>
All the fun, however, is in getting there. "The Illusion" takes us into 
territory on which theater thrives: fantasy, witchcraft, transcended place and 
time, aided and abetted here by David Schweizer's astutely playful direction, 
Douglas D. Smith's bewitching sets and lights (crucial to the consummation of 
this piece) and costumer Marianna Elliott's whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
The entire play happens in Alcandre's cave, a forbidding place, watched over by 
Alcandre's sinister amanuensis (Tom Cayler, garbed in a black outfit that seems 
lifted from some Gustave Dore illustration) and where Pridamant watches on the 
sidelines while Alcandre leads him through reconstituted events in his son's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
We watch the son (Jonathan Silverman) fall in love with a woman above his 
station (Lea Thompson), kill one dandified suitor (Mitchell Lichtenstein), 
fight a duel with another (the inimitable John Fleck as her ostentatious 
fiance), marry the girl over her father's objections and the thwartings of her 
jealous maid (Karole Lynn Foreman). Truth or apparitions? We'll let you savor 
the surprises of the Corneille/Kushner ending. They're worth waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
This "Illusion" is a fascinating hybrid of fantasy and humor, with the magic 
remembering that it has feet of clay. It's not "The Wizard of Oz" exactly, but 
. . . Mandell is sheer pleasure as the befuddled father who has never tasted 
tears but who, after we discover that he has a heart, proves to be a man of 
straw after all. Woronov's Alcandre looks like some Assyrian prince, with 
skullcap and gold "beard," but this is a fundamentally benevolent wizard who 
just likes to keep everybody guessing. 
</P>
<P>
It's sometimes hard to believe that Silverman as the swashbuckling son isn't 
playing Eugene Jerome (the role that launched him) playing Errol Flynn. But the 
contemporaneous feel of the production ultimately makes this nice Jewish 
all-American quality not only acceptable but positively endearing. Thompson is 
everything a spunky Juliet ought to be and Foreman everything a sassy, 
double-dealing and resourceful servant ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
Cayler's Igor-ish amanuensis is a scene-stealer. But he and the other 
scene-stealer, Fleck, can't help it. Attention is mother's milk to the richly 
gifted Fleck, a bilious cross between Miles Gloriosus and the Cowardly Lion in 
his golden Roman breastplate, flaming red locks and clunky golden boots. 
</P>
<P>
His dazzle rivals Smith's setting, which is dominated by an ornamental gilt 
frame whose ever-changing canvases (here's to the magic of rear projection) 
range from dreamy classical landscapes to modern images -- none more poetic or 
impressive than the last, which points to our quest for new worlds in space. It 
is an inspired signature for a wise piece of work that never forgets to play as 
it instructs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 514 S. Spring St. Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays 
and Sundays at 2, until May 27; $22-$26; (213) 627-5599.

KNSD-TV REPLACES HUNT AS HOST OF 'SPORTS WRAP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When KNSD-TV (Channel 39) Sports Director Jim Laslavic decided two weeks ago to 
continue doing the San Diego Chargers radio broadcasts, it sealed the fate of 
No. 2 sports guy Kevin Hunt, who was given his walking papers last week, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 hoped Laslavic would drop the radio broadcasts and take over as host 
of the Sunday afternoon "Sports Wrap" show, which debuted during football 
season last year, with Hunt as host. News Director Don Shafer had been unhappy 
with Hunt for months, and only the support of Laslavic and station general 
manager Neil Derrough saved his job. They felt Hunt had earned a chance with 
his hard work of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt was hired a year and a half ago by the station's previous news director. 
</P>
<P>
"It all started when (former news director) Nancy Bauer left and Don came in," 
Hunt said, referring to last summer. "It was real apparent he wanted to bring 
in his sportscaster from Tucson to replace me." 
</P>
<P>
The deal to bring in Shafer's friend from Arizona fell through, but the station 
didn't renew Hunt's contract last September and it was clear his job was on 
thin ice. 
</P>
<P>
According to station sources, Shafer didn't want Hunt to host "Sports Wrap." 
Thought perky and prone to silly errors, Hunt was generally respected at the 
station for his light feature packages. But, several months ago, he was told to 
improve his anchoring skills. 
</P>
<P>
The powers-that-be were also not thrilled with his "on-air look," particularly 
the weight he had added since joining the station, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
Laslavic said his decision to stick with the Chargers broadcast was a "tip-off" 
to Hunt's future. When he committed to the radio broadcasts, the station was 
faced with another season of Hunt on "Sports Wrap," and Shafer got his way. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was in (Laslavic's) shoes I would have gone with the radio job," Hunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt knew he was in trouble but, believing he had weathered the storm, was 
nevertheless "surprised" by his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's replacement will be Jim Stone, sports director of WGAL-TV in Lancaster, 
Pa., an NBC affiliate. Shafer and Stone reportedly worked together in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Both Derrough and Shafer were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Stone is a "hard worker with good contacts," said Bill Fisher, sports editor of 
the Sunday News of Lancaster, adding that Stone is prone to expressions such as 
"boom time" to describe a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Snyder, assistant sports editor of the Harrisburg Patriot News, described 
Stone as a "low-key, workmanlike" sportscaster who "doesn't go for a lot of 
glitz" and is "definitely not an entertainer." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt expects to stay on the air until the end of the month, when Stone is 
scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-TV (Channel 8) has given Larry Mendte the go-ahead to produce a pilot for 
a half-hour comedy show featuring an ensemble of local comedians. The show, 
"Channel Z," will spotlight skits and parodies, in the SCTV mode, by local 
comedians Russ T. Nailz and Mark Brazil, comedy writer Mark McNeil, and Mendte. 
KGB-FM's (101.5) Cookie "Chainsaw" Randolph and comedian Steve Kelley are also 
scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
The first show, now in production, will include bits such as "Billy the Circus 
Boy," about a boy who runs off to join a middle-class family, and "Dueling 
Leitners," spotlighting Randolph's impression of Channel 8 sports guy Ted 
Leitner. 
</P>
<P>
The show is tentatively scheduled to air on Saturdays at 7 p.m., but no date 
has been set for the first show. 
</P>
<P>
Local Morning News Wars will officially begin next Monday, when Channel 8 
begins a half-hour 6:30 a.m. news program, directly competing with Channel 10's 
established newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 veteran Lorraine Kimel will co-anchor the show, with a yet unnamed 
male. The station will probably hire someone for the slot, using existing 
staffers in the interim, according to Jim Holtzman, stations news director. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the move, Channel 8 will move "CBS This Morning" to 7 a.m., its 
regular time slot, and "Sun Up San Diego" will move from 8 to 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A new agreement with CBS may have provided some "impetus" for the move, 
Holtzman acknowledged, but it is something the station has wanted to do for a 
while. Channel 8, like all CBS affiliates, hopes that "This Morning," with 
former Channel 8 reporter Paula Zahn as hostess, may finally find an audience. 
The move probably won't hurt "Sun Up," which posts steady mediocre ratings. 
"House Party," a syndicated talk show now airing at 9 a.m., will be dropped. It 
won't be mourned. 
</P>
<P>
"It all seems to to fit together nicely," Holtzman said. 
</P>
<P>
New XHRM-FM (92.5) General Manager Lee Mirabal says the station will be going 
"back to its urban roots," playing more urban dance music and less "European 
rock." The change, she acknowledges, was made, in part, to address the black 
audience the station supposedly abandoned when its Mexican owners kicked out 
operator Willie Morrow a few months ago for failing to pay his bills. "It's 
always been my dream to program this station for a black audience," Mirabal 
said. She worked at the station in 1978 and '79. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of Channel 10's first updates during "Headline News" last Monday was 
immediately followed by an ad for Channel 8's news team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-AM (760) news director Cliff Albert told Tribune gossip columnist Allison 
DaRosa that shootings are so frequent in Southeast San Diego that the station 
seldom covers what they call "environmental homicides." Cute. But, if quoted 
accurately, Albert has added fuel to criticism from minorities that the media 
treat a murder in Chula Vista differently than a murder in, say, Encinitas. 
(Albert was unavailable for comment Friday.) . . . 
</P>
<P>
After a recent Channel 10 editorial denouncing the tuna industry, station 
employees decided to take a stand. They voted to eliminate tuna from the 
cafeteria menu. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Channel 39 reporter John Britton, who was dumped last year after 16 
years with the station, is general manager of the News Monitoring Service, a 
local video clipping service. . . . 
</P>
<P>
According to his agent's office, former Channel 39 sports guy Bobby Estill is 
still in San Diego looking for work in television. He is now "in negotiations" 
for a job, presumably in another market. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former XTRA AM and FM promotions director Rob Tonkin has been hired as 
promotions director of KQLZ-FM (Pirate Radio) in Los Angeles.

Anita Baker to Wreck Home: Preservationists in Detroit are upset with singer 
Anita Baker because of her plans to demolish the historic Chene mansion on the 
city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
The building was built in 1850 by Alexander Chene, whose family had owned the 
land since 1707 under a grant from the king of France. Baker hasn't revealed 
what she intends to build on the site after razing it. Baker and her husband, 
Walter Bridgeforth Jr., bought the mansion after the February closure of Little 
Harry's restaurant, which had been housed there since 1958. Preservationists 
said they can't understand why Baker would want to tear down the only surviving 
example of that type of house in the city. GREG BRAXTON

The winter art drought is letting up here and there, with shows of work by 
strong younger artists from Southern California and a group of golden (and 
not-so-golden) oldies from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Guggenheim Gallery at Chapman College is awash in an outpouring of paintings 
and mixed-media constructions by a young Philippine artist, Manuel Ocampo, who 
now lives in Los Angeles. His bizarrely apropos art background consists of 
drawing cartoons for an underground newspaper and copying religious paintings 
for the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Although reminiscent at times of the folkloric simplicity and outspoken 
personal anguish associated with Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, his art is really 
a different kind of animal. Brash and nervy, it mingles the outer shell of 
passion with a cool, self-conscious inventiveness that shamelessly borrows from 
the history of Western political, religious and avant-garde art. Ocampo's 
central theme is the Philippines' pervasive lack of self-definition, as the 
only country in Southeast Asia that became subject to Western colonialism 
before it had developed its own centralized government or advanced culture. 
</P>
<P>
His images are paintings of imaginary bloody martyrs and violent events, mock 
posters invoking a call to action or an outpouring of despair, still lifes 
suffused with religious imagery and three-dimensional constructions that 
suggest the sorry residue of fantasized scenes of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
These pieces, produced in a bewildering variety of styles, offer a grab bag of 
cathartic ways of coming to terms with the bottled up emotions of a people who 
experienced 333 years of Spanish rule, 48 years of U.S. government, more than 
two decades of dictatorship under Ferdinand Marcos and an ongoing American 
military presence. Many of the works are spuriously dated -- 1917, 1948, 1981 
-- to reinforce the fictive sense of a shared history of personal involvement 
in the country's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Ocampo's pieces include swastikas, which -- along with the gruesomeness 
of some of the imagery -- reportedly have upset some gallery visitors. But the 
swastikas clearly are meant as emblems of oppression, and the bloody scenes 
reflect Catholic folk tradition, political struggle and -- seemingly -- 
self-inflicted psychological wounds. 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Coast College Art Gallery in Costa Mesa, meticulously painted images 
on coolly well-proportioned ceramic sculptures of female figures by Barbara 
Dorris are meditations on the mysteries of internal physical experience -- most 
vividly, the process of conception and the ravaging of the body by disease. 
</P>
<P>
On the cross-section of a woman's torso, a pair of hands perform legerdemain 
with an egg and a towel enclosing a small flame. Deer run down the side of one 
hip. These delicately allusive metaphoric images conjure up both physical event 
and bodily sensation: the initial creation of life and the movements of a fetus 
in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Visitation," the figure is a bust-length woman's figure, sheared off at 
one shoulder. Painted in luminous, matter-of-fact detail on the surface of this 
cross-section are two large green and orange bugs crawling over a lump of earth 
on clean red flagstones just beyond a closed white door. The juxtaposition of 
the well-manicured threshold of a house -- a bastion of security and 
orderliness -- with the quietly persistent rhythms of insect life offers a 
vivid image for the doggedly invasive force of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A rain of fire falling on an umbrella blown inside-out and ringed with burning 
tapers ("Dermis") is a metaphor for the resilient -- but thin and infinitely 
sensitive -- layers of human skin. The vertically amputated torso figure on 
which this image is painted lists slightly to one side, as if mirroring the 
vulnerability of the human body. For Dorris -- long in possession of an 
effortless technique but in search of meaningful subject matter -- this series 
marks a personal breakthrough in its exquisitely empathic treatment of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of low-key meditations on ecological themes by Cynthia Kastan and Mary 
Linn Hughes sit comfortably under the umbrella, "The Nature of Things," at BC 
Space in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kastan takes black-and-white aerial photographs of sprawling landscapes in 
various U.S. locations and turns them into photo-silk screens, printed 
off-register (to create a sense of depth) and overlaid with brightly colored 
lines and squiggles. 
</P>
<P>
In the manner of ancient South American earthworks, these patterns turn the 
contours of rivers, valleys and plains into the outlines of grandly scaled 
images and vignettes: a fish, a face, a fanciful creature chasing an antelope. 
The suggestion is that the distance of long-range contemplation reveals a 
spiritual presence that still inhabits our much-beleaguered natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The margins of some of these pieces also include images of a broad range of 
human and animal life. In "Facets: Stretch," photographs of film actors, a 
bare-chested masked performer, acrobatic monkeys, a creeping lizard and a 
forward-lurching dinosaur skeleton seem to be engaged in a global demonstration 
of the word stretch, as if to indicate the ties that bind the kingdom of the 
animals. It's a worthy idea, and yet one wants the piece to reveal a more 
intricate and sophisticated visual syntax that goes beyond a simple system of 
equivalences. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' untitled installation soothes the senses immediately, with sounds of 
running water and an atmospheric scattering of sharply scented eucalyptus 
leaves on the floor. Crunching through them, the viewer passes an invitingly 
touchable plot of grass, circles a heaped cord of wood in the center of the 
gallery, spots a hanging stuffed bird and a motto framed in chicken bones, and 
finally reads a message chalked across a wall. The message -- which invokes a 
list of famous dead people whose molecules are still circulating in the 
universe -- asks the viewer to consider that "no life is isolated from other 
life." 
</P>
<P>
There are some problems here. Moralizing or lecturing to the viewer is usually 
a sure way for a work of art to commit hara-kiri. The stuffed bird adds an 
unwanted reminder of cliched wildlife art and the bone-framed sentiment ("There 
is no way around the fact that we are involved with each other") is 
embarrassingly over-earnest and redundant. And yet, Hughes has softened and 
seduced the viewer with her tactile, aromatic evocation of the natural world. 
This piece has an undeniable charm, and its simple but grandly significant 
message lingers compellingly in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
LJB Gallery in Newport Beach is walking down memory lane with a bunch of 
paintings and other pieces by some fondly remembered figures from California 
art of the swinging '60s, courtesy of Jackie Stuart, the widow of Los Angeles 
gallery owner David Stuart. Although much of the work seems to have been chosen 
with the flighty tastes of Orange County in mind, and some notable names are 
represented by so-so work, there are a few treats here. 
</P>
<P>
Most generously served is Robert Dowd, whose loopy, wildly oversize paintings 
of American folding money linger lovingly on the ornate seals, the patterned 
intricacies of steel engraving and numismatists' dreams of finding valuable 
printing errors. Not to mention Dowd's fantasies -- to contemporary eyes, 
all-too-prescient -- of a conflation of greenbacks and art, as in "Picasso 
Dollar," in which a Picassoid woman's head replaces George Washington's. 
</P>
<P>
Llyn Foulkes -- like Dowd, an artist whose work was included in Newport Harbor 
Art Museum's "L.A. Pop in the '60s" exhibition last year -- also comes on 
strong. One of his oddly anthropomorphic landscapes, "Ercha's Rock," a large 
image of a craggy outcropping, is paired with a handwritten fragment of prose 
("The rock hung without the man"). The painted frame reinforces the sense that 
this work is a self-conscious artifact of the imagination -- a grand, 
semi-serious parody of the tradition of the Western novel. 
</P>
<P>
John Altoon's untitled watercolor of three figures offers his inimitable 
serendipitous way with jabs, scribbles and rushes of color. Lumbering and 
delicate forms nudge each other in teasing ways, and the color has a joyous, 
springtime feel. William Copley's all-over patterns of tiny figures and jokey 
tete-a-tete ("Now No") still retain a happy-go-lucky appeal. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing else really sings any more. James Strombotne's paintings look glum 
and awkward. The Peter Voulkos pieces are small and tame, compared to the wild, 
galumphing works that set the hitherto tame world of ceramics on its ear. 
Hassel Smith has done many more striking abstract paintings. Could we ever have 
found any substance in Mel Ramos' airbrushed cuties? Did anyone ever take 
Laurence Dreiband's male fantasies of teenie-boppers seriously? What a long 
time ago it was. 
</P>
<P>

MAREK JANOWSKI MAKES A PROMISING PHILHARMONIC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marek Janowski, who made an auspicious debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
on Friday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, isn't the sort of conductor who 
makes the collective heart beat faster. 
</P>
<P>
But he is, in the best sense, a fine Kapellmeister. As such, he belongs to a 
valuable, rapidly vanishing species. 
</P>
<P>
Born 51 years ago in Warsaw (not West Germany, as the program biography 
claimed), he attended the conservatory in Cologne, studied violin and piano as 
well as conducting, trained subsequently as an operatic coach, and perfected 
his baton technique under Wolfgang Sawallisch, among others. Methodically, he 
worked his way from engagements with minor opera houses and orchestras to key 
posts at leading international institutions. 
</P>
<P>
He learned his craft, and its ramifications, the old-fashioned way. He paid his 
dues. 
</P>
<P>
Janowski obviously understands the challenges at hand. He avoids any temptation 
to distort or exaggerate, and he invariably gives clear signals. 
</P>
<P>
He is not a flamboyant podium personality. He is not the sort of interpreter 
who illuminates old pieces with new ideas. He tends to get out of the way and 
let the music do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
He opened this concert with a tasteful, majestic yet adequately sensuous 
performance of Wagner's 'Tannhauser" overture. After intermission, he 
concentrated on a taut yet fluid, essentially lyrical account of Schumann's 
"Rhenish" Symphony. The Philharmonic played alertly for him, with spirit and 
with generous contrasts of dynamic and color. 
</P>
<P>
It would probably take a few more rehearsals for the strings to unscramble the 
climactic convolutions of Wagner's Venusberg. Greater familiarity with the 
conductor would no doubt breed greater contentment in matters of unison attack 
and subtle nuance. A stranger, no matter how competent, can achieve only so 
much in a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Janowski's authority and professionalism were always reassuring. 
With him at the helm, the listener could sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
One hopes he will come back soon. One hopes he will stay a little longer next 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The soloist of the evening was Horacio Gutierrez, who mustered a performance of 
Chopin's E-minor Concerto that vacillated between sublime poetry and clumsy 
prose. 
</P>
<P>
The popular Cuban-born pianist played the introspective passages, for the most 
part, with affecting delicacy, with insinuating rubato and rare bel-canto 
allure. He sometimes impaired the rhapsodic flights, however, with misgauged 
bombast. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, the essential bridge between the heroic gesture and the 
intimate impulse seemed to elude Gutierrez. One assumes it was just an off 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Chopin asked relatively little of the orchestra. Janowski and the Philharmonic 
set the moods briskly, sustained them efficiently, accompanied the pianist 
sensitively. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was surprisingly sparse though predictably enthusiastic. The 
Philharmonic management announced, incidentally, that this concert "honored the 
artistry" of Sarah Vaughan. It didn't seem to be a particularly fitting 
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, if all goes as planned: The return of Andre Previn.

"I Love Lucy" Pilot Discovered: The original pilot for "I Love Lucy," which has 
been missing for 40 years, has been found under a bed where it had been 
forgotten for 39 years. Joanne Perez, the widow of vaudeville performer Pepito 
the Spanish clown, discovered a copy of the pilot -- a gift to her husband from 
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
Pepito had coached Ball in some of her stage routines, and guest-starred on the 
pilot. Although Perez knew she had one of the show's episodes in her 
possession, she didn't realize which one or the value of it until a recent 
conversation with B. Donald (Bud) Grant, who will coordinate an hour-long 
special to air in May on CBS which will include the 34-minute pilot as well as 
tributes to the show and cast. The 34-minute print is apparently the only one 
in existence.GREG BRAXTON

POP CAPSULES : RAPPERS ABOVE THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Now I got a murder rap" is the boastful refrain of the hit song by rap 
newcomers Above the Law, but this outlaw-ethos exploitation crew from 
South-Central L.A. couldn't get arrested on Saturday at Anaheim's Celebrity 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a big, interactive crowd for a rap concert to reach critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
The Celebrity's all-rookie bill of Above the Law, fellow Angelenos Low Profile 
and New York's Gang Starr played to a 2,500-seat house that was four-fifths 
empty and far from rocking. 
</P>
<P>
Above the Law's main man, 187um (in police code, a 187 is a killing), was 
energetic enough, but this short, stocky figure didn't come close to achieving 
the menace or swagger of the hip-hop Stagger Lee he purports to be. Above the 
Law may claim to be the voice of underclass experience, but its artless raps 
failed to evoke lived experience of any sort. ATL's 25-minute set (which 
included a chaotic but lively guest tag-team rhyme workout with 
better-established cronies N.W.A) was skimpy for a headliner, even by rap's 
wham-bam-outta-here standards. MIKE BOEHM

POP CAPSULES : COOPER: FREAKY SIDESHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Cooper was wearing dresses before David Bowie became an androgynous 
rebel, and he did stupid pet tricks with reptiles before Ozzy Osbourne went 
batty. Still, Cooper is generally considered a freaky sideshow rather than a 
rock pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
His concert at the Pantages Theatre on Saturday was a forceful reminder that 
the endearingly tacky ghoul-rocker's anthems like "Eighteen" have influenced 
everything from punk to metal. History doesn't mean much, though, when you're 
only as valid as last week's sales report, so Cooper (who also plays San 
Diego's California Theatre on Thursday) alternated his familiar shock-rockers 
with material from his latest album, "Trash." These songs, as faceless as most 
Republican-era rock, fit the Bon Jovi hit formula: predictable sing-alongs 
blasted with a technical efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Cooper will headline Lee Atwater's next function. Washington 
wives might be chagrined by the show's re-staging of the rumble from "West Side 
Story," with Cooper slashing a girl's throat before singing "Only Women Bleed." 
But these contrived, comic-book theatrics are really as inoffensive as a 
spook-house ride. In fact, the most frightening part of the evening was 
probably the drum solo. CRAIG LEE

ROVA QUARTET CAPABLE ON SAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cutting-edge group known as the ROVA Saxophone Quartet (its acronym uses 
the initials of the founding members) was in town Saturday for a concert at the 
Southern California Institute of Architecture in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old unit resembles the World Saxophone Quartet only in the absence 
of a rhythm section. 
</P>
<P>
ROVA is well rehearsed, it plays in tune, and it aims at a pan-musical 
avant-garde experience. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the evening there was a continual interchange between unison 
and harmony, tonality and atonality, counterpoint and polyphony, rhythmic 
pulses and timelessness. It also deals with strict composition and total 
freedom, which could be easily distinguished in Steve Lacy's brilliantly 
structured "Precipitation Suite," but in Henry Threadgill's "Background" the 
dividing line was hard to detect. ROVA tells you everything you wanted to know 
about the sax but were afraid to ask. 
</P>
<P>
Original works within the group were composed by baritone saxophonist John 
Raskin, tenor sax soloist Larry Ochs (who doubled on soprano sax) and the 
newest member, altoist Steve Adams. Bruce Ackley on soprano sax contributed 
some of the most emotionally moving solos. 
</P>
<P>
At times energy tended to replace form, and intensity took precedence over 
content. At one point a table was brought on stage bearing gadgets: a toy 
trumpet, balls and flags, used as hand signals during a hysterical piece. This 
exercise in pretension tipped over the border between the sublime to the 
ridiculous; such gimmicks are unfunny and uncalled for. 
</P>
<P>
A strange interlude had the men playing one staccato chord every five seconds. 
During the intervening silences a dog outside the hall barked in what seemed 
like perfect time. This was truly an outstanding example of aleatory music.

POP CAPSULES : DAVE EDMUNDS' REVUE A SMOKING COMBINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever the questionable ethics of a rock show taking place under the glaring 
banners of a tobacco company, "Dave Edmunds' Rock &amp; Roll Revue" was 
certainly smoking at the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday. The unlikely 
grouping of Edmunds, Graham Parker, Dion and the Fabulous Thunderbirds' Kim 
Wilson was a salute to the multi-act bills common in the '50s, and by show's 
end the combination seemed nothing less than inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Pumped by a nine-piece band -- with Stax guitar legend Steve Cropper playing 
with a marvelous incandescence throughout -- the singers worked at their peaks. 
Wilson sank his powerful, emotive voice deep into the soul ballad "Wasted 
Tears." Parker and Dion each worked the far ends of their catalogues, with an 
upbeat Parker reaching back to '76 for "Heat Treatment." Dion drew from his 
recent "Yo, Frankie" album and his '50s classics and teamed with Parker and 
Edmunds for a disarmingly moving reinterpretation of "Abraham, Martin and 
John." 
</P>
<P>
Edmunds more than made up for his moribund shows of recent years with his 
charged vocals and snarling guitar work on the hook-crammed "King of Love" and 
"Paralyzed."JIM WASHBURN

Violent crime in the United States rose 5% last year, and so-called serious 
property crime, such as burglary, rose 2%, according to a preliminary report 
released by the FBI. Overall, the average increase in serious crimes was about 
the same as the previous year and compared with a 2% rise in 1987, a 6% jump in 
1986 and a 5% rise in 1985, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities with populations of more than 50,000 -- in which about 80.9 million 
people live -- reported serious crimes up 3% last year. Suburbs and rural areas 
-- home to some 132.2 million people -- saw a 2% increase. The figures were 
compiled from police reports of murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated 
assault, burglary, larceny-theft, auto theft and arson.

A replacement driver for Greyhound Bus Lines was charged with carrying a

AMERICAN INDIAN POWWOW UNITES PRESENT WITH PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tepee appeared on the neatly manicured lawn outside Sacred Heart School in 
Ventura Sunday as more than 300 people celebrated American Indian culture in an 
intertribal powwow. 
</P>
<P>
The powwow, once a symbolic ritual to mark success in tribal warfare, united 
representatives from 47 tribes in Ventura County for feasting and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of things to being an Indian besides a state of mind," said Bob 
Peterson, chairman of the board of the directors for the Native American Indian 
Inter-Tribal Assn. of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope to hold the powwow and other fund-raising events at least twice 
a year, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit association was formed just last year to give Indians a social 
outlet, but leaders said they also want to fill a void in the educational 
system. Although the nearest reservation is in Santa Barbara County, up to 
6,000 people in Ventura County identify with Indian culture but have no 
communal land to call home, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who is part Ogalala Sioux, said he came to Ventura County from 
Burbank and recently began researching his heritage so that he could pass it on 
to his children. 
</P>
<P>
The intertribal association he leads sponsored the event to raise money for 
programs for free tutoring, counseling and information about Indian culture 
through the California Indian Education Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Female dancers drew bright fringed shawls around themselves and swayed to a 
steady drumbeat as men chanted and shook percussion instruments made of 
feathers and gourds. 
</P>
<P>
Like Peterson, many who gathered were trying to regain part of their culture. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy McCullen, 36, of Camarillo pulled a red shawl around her 4-year-old 
daughter Amber before they rose to do a traditional shawl dance. As McCullen 
rocked silently to the drums, she imparted to her daughter movements that have 
been performed for generations but that she only recently had learned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to regain an important part of our heritage that skipped my 
generation," said McCullen, a Choctaw. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know what your roots are," said Ken Yackytooahnipah, a Comanche 
from Oklahoma and one of the organizers of the powwow.

TIME IS BRINGING NEW COUNCIL'S AIMS INTO FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four months ago, the city of Ventura braced itself for a major transformation. 
After one of the most expensive and hotly debated City Council elections in 
Ventura history, a landslide vote swept three environmental candidates into 
office. 
</P>
<P>
County planner Todd Collart, League of Women Voters leader Cathy Bean and 
former world-class distance runner Gary Tuttle were elected with a strong 
mandate to slow down development and preserve the city's natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
They joined two incumbents elected in 1987 on similar platforms -- the mayor, 
attorney Richard Francis and the vice mayor, anatomy professor Don Villeneuve 
to give slow-growth forces a clear majority in the city's governing body for 
the first time since the mid 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Holdovers Jim Monahan, who came in a distant fourth in the November elections 
-- and John McWherter found themselves in a minority for the first time in 
their long City Council careers. 
</P>
<P>
As the new council enters its fifth month in office, this much is clear: 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the grass-roots movement that helped the new council members get 
elected are delighted with the new directions the city government appears to be 
taking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the average Venturan is finally being represented," said John 
Middlebrook, a cabdriver and key member of the Alliance for Ventura's Future, 
the group that was instrumental in the November election victories. "They are 
trusted servants who are carrying out their mandates." 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders, on the other hand, are as concerned as they were on election 
day that the new council's anti-growth tendencies may ruin the city forever. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any living organism, the city needs to develop and grow," said Ventura 
Chamber of Commerce President Bob Gregorchuck. "Every city needs a tax base. 
But with this no-growth council, a couple of auto dealerships -- our main 
source of sales tax -- are leaving town already. And there are no more 
developer fees because of the building moratorium. Where is the money going to 
come from? Like they say, there's no free lunch." 
</P>
<P>
But although some changes in the city have indeed taken place, both sides agree 
it is too early to make any final judgments. In fact, by all accounts the new 
council has not had the opportunity to develop an agenda or establish much of a 
track record because of two major policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
First, the council had to deal with a water shortage emergency that hit the 
city just two weeks after the new members were sworn in. Last month the council 
adopted an unpopular, stringent water-rationing plan that includes a moratorium 
on new water hookups, thereby bringing all new development in the city to a 
standstill. 
</P>
<P>
The most strident critics of the emergency measures were the Chamber of 
Commerce and the developers, who argued that the city was overreacting to the 
shortage and using it as an excuse to cut off development. 
</P>
<P>
The other issue that keeps the council busy these days is the question of 
whether Ventura should allow the development of a Cal State University campus 
at Taylor Ranch, on the outskirts of the city. The debate is nearing a climax 
as the university moves forward with an environmental impact report on the 
site, the final step before construction begins. 
</P>
<P>
Although a majority of the previous council supported the Taylor Ranch site, 
the new council is divided on whether the university should be built there and 
if so, under what conditions. 
</P>
<P>
These issues have forced inexperienced council members into difficult decisions 
without the benefit of much time to learn their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest change in City Hall so far is the way the new council 
conducts business. Council meetings are longer and at times more confusing than 
in the past, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also spend more time in City Hall overseeing staff members and 
reviewing their decisions, key staff officials say. They add that council 
subcommittees are more active than in the past, and the city staff's workload 
has increased significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know the details, the actual mechanics of what goes into our 
decision-making process, especially on growth-related issues," said City 
Planner Everett Millais. "Wanting to be educated is typical of all new 
councils. What's different is the depth of detail these people want." 
</P>
<P>
Parks and Recreation Director Barbara Harrison agreed. "They are asking more 
questions, they really want the background," she said. The council's interest 
in the arts and the environment, Harrison said, has brought her department more 
publicity and more work than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
She cites a new cultural arts program and a bike path study as examples. "This 
council really wants to make Ventura a better place to live in," she said, "and 
we can help them do that." 
</P>
<P>
But there are some critics of the increased council supervision of staff 
members who view it as a sign of heavy-handedness, distrust and an inability on 
the part of new council members to delegate authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure there are people who get frustrated," City Manager John Baker said. 
"They've spent so much time operating in a certain way that they became 
comfortable, and now they have to change." 
</P>
<P>
The city's Planning Commission, for one, has made it clear that it does not 
welcome what it perceives as interference from the council. At a recent 
commission meeting, its members blasted the council for telling them to turn 
down every single proposed new housing project because of the water shortage. 
The commission was not even consulted when the council adopted the moratorium 
on water hookups, commissioners complained. 
</P>
<P>
"By telling us to simply deny all new development, we are left without the 
possibility of making any relevant input," said Commissioner Gary Nasalroad, a 
candidate for council who lost in the past election. "We're being left out of 
the loop." 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, say the three new council members. They say they had to neglect the 
Planning Commission to deal with the recent water emergency, and promise to 
iron out differences as soon as they have time. 
</P>
<P>
And most city officials have nothing to worry about, council members say -- 
they have complete confidence in their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one exception, Bean, Tuttle and Collart said. It is the Department 
of Public Works, which is responsible for providing an adequate water supply to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think that individually they are all top professionals," Collart 
said. "But I can't understand how they let the water problem fall through the 
cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, at Tuttle's request, the city commissioned an independent 
consultant -- not staff members -- to study short-term alternatives to deal 
with the water crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a credibility problem when it comes to water, and I think 
justifiably so," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the fire, Baker recently banned all of the city's water 
officials from commenting on the water crisis, on grounds that these officials 
were making contradictory statements and that they were being distracted by the 
flood of interview requests from the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the new policy just fine," said Public Works Director Shelley Jones, 
who was allowed to comment for this story. "There have been some changes and we 
have to adjust." He said it was a lack of rain last November, not his staff, 
that caused the water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, their inordinate interest in city affairs should be viewed as a 
plus, council members say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all over the place," said Tuttle, "and maybe that's just what the city 
needed -- some goals, some plans, some real analysis. We don't just 
rubber-stamp decisions from staff." 
</P>
<P>
That may be an understatement, if council meetings are any indication. Before 
the new council took office, meetings were quicker, more predictable and staff 
recommendations went unquestioned more often than not, Francis, Villeneuve and 
Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
The current council's meetings sometimes turn into long, rambling discussions 
that last for hours and do not arrive at any specific conclusion. Public 
hearings are open, closed and reopened again. Motions are made, then amended, 
then the amendment is amended, and so on. In almost every meeting, after long 
debates, items are sent back to subcommittees for further review. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, several meetings have ended past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve sees nothing wrong with the way council meetings are now carried 
out. "The old council operated an old boys' network. They all met in the 
downtown Lions Club, they traveled the same circles and no one questioned the 
subcommittees. It was an unstated rule that issues were resolved before the 
night of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This council is raising a lot of questions, there are honest efforts to 
convince each other, minds are made up during the meetings and decisions are 
taken in front of the public." 
</P>
<P>
Francis, on the other hand, said he believes that the council's reflective 
approach to issues is sometimes its biggest weakness. "I'm afraid we are 
falling into an analytical paralysis. Sometimes I wish we'd just go ahead and 
vote and get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, a veteran of 15 years in the council, is even more blunt: "In the 
past, councils acted like professional bodies." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the long meetings, which are televised on the local cable 
channel, have helped viewers identify the different council personalities that 
are beginning to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle has increasingly focused on problems of individual citizens. More often 
than not, he is singled out by residents for his accessibility and the efforts 
he puts into solving their problems, regardless of how small they may be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've found my niche in council -- it is dealing with individuals and 
their problems," he said recently in his sportswear store, where he mixes sales 
pitches with city business. Blushing, he admits: "I kind of like it when they 
mention me in meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Francis, the lawyer, is well-versed in the art of building alliances. When 
faced with a proposal he dislikes and the prospect of a losing vote, he often 
proposes a compromise amendment that would make it worthwhile for him to be on 
the winning side. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a sophisticated understanding of the political process," he said, 
grinning, during an interview in his downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the rest of the first-term council members, he has moved away from the 
slow-growth camp to expand his support base by siding with Monahan and 
McWherter in favoring the Taylor Ranch site and a plan to import state water. 
</P>
<P>
Bean's obvious strength is her candor. When the council debate gets so 
confusing that no one can keep track of what's being proposed, Bean invariably 
asks, "Could someone tell me what's going on?" as her six colleagues breathe a 
collective sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Collart, the top vote-getter in the 1989 election, is the most respected 
member of the council, according to several of his colleagues. His motions 
carry several votes -- if not an outright majority -- and his questions seem to 
capture his colleagues' undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter is the least predictable of all the council members, fluctuating from 
slow-growth to pro-growth positions depending on the issues. Villeneuve, 
soft-spoken and understated, likes to keep a low profile, but has become a sort 
of elder statesman for the slow-growth faction. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Ventura's most recent former mayor, who last year presided 
over a council that was accused of being too friendly toward developers. Today, 
now in the minority, Monahan sees himself as the conscience of the council. 
</P>
<P>
Often the lone dissenter in council votes, he said he thrives on making motions 
that are bound to fail, but which expose the council's bias against growth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind being alone on the opposition," he said. "I think it's fun."

BUSY OXNARD CONSULATE IS A HELP DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not embassy row, but the Oxnard transportation center is the home of one 
of the busiest Mexican consulates in California. 
</P>
<P>
Up well-worn stairs from the Greyhound bus station, above the Amtrak 
concession, Consul Zoila Arroyo de Rodriguez and a staff of six tend to the 
needs of many of the tens of thousands of Mexicans who live in Ventura, Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 400 people will file through the small consulate each day during 
peak summer and Christmas seasons, seeking help of many kinds. About 150 will 
come even on the slow days. 
</P>
<P>
A few are farm workers abused by employers. Others, legal residents of the 
United States, want documents so they can visit relatives in their native land. 
</P>
<P>
Many are newcomers, streaming in on buses and at a loss for how to cope in a 
strange world that offers not only promise but also the deception of con 
artists and the prospect of arrest by the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"Our most important job is to protect our people when they have a problem, a 
labor problem or any kind of problem," said Arroyo, a veteran diplomat who for 
21 years was in charge of cultural and student exchange programs at a large 
consulate in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Under her control since July, the Oxnard consulate today is known as much for 
the consul's aggressiveness and visibility as for its central location at the 
downtown bus station on 4th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a pretty dynamic character," said Marco Antonio Abarca, attorney for the 
nearby California Rural Legal Assistance office. "In Montreal, she mainly 
worked with diplomats and upper-class Mexicans. She says she likes it here 
because she deals with the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has repeatedly brought farm workers with legal problems to Abarca's 
Oxnard office for assistance, Abarca said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's visible, very accessible. Her office covers everything," he said. "If 
somebody dies and the family wants the body shipped back, they'll take care of 
it. If a Mexican citizen is jailed, she'll go over to help him. She has even 
taken us out to the fields sometimes, to different farm worker camps. She wants 
to see how people are living." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo, thin, bespectacled and soft-spoken, has made a name for herself locally 
among prosecutors, politicians, arts groups and the wide range of agencies that 
deal with immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury said his office is working with her to gain 
financial support for children of Mexican nationals both here and in Mexico and 
to crack down on businesses that defraud immigrants by selling shoddy products. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the consul's presence is being clearly recognized here," 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Garcia, an immigration specialist at El Concilio de Condado de Ventura, 
said his nonprofit agency fields about 30 telephone calls a week from the 
consulate and receives about one referral a day from it. Problems range from 
youth violence, to preparation of legal documents to family and mental health 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation from the consulate is new, Garcia said. Not long before Arroyo 
arrived last year, El Concilio offered its services to the former consul. "He 
wrote back and said they only do passports," Garcia said. "But Zoila takes 
seriously her job as a true representative of Mexico. It is a drastic change." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo is a regular on a Spanish-language talk show broadcast here and in Santa 
Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
She supported a recent Spanish-language play at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium and 
arranged for the renowned Ballet Folklorico of Mexico City to perform there in 
the group's first Southland visit in 11 years, said Andres Herrera, aide to 
county Supervisor John K. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said he could not even remember the name of Arroyo's predecessor, but 
has heard from Arroyo at least two dozen times. "I see her everywhere," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxnard is a very active city, very important," Arroyo said. "All consuls 
should have this experience." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government opened its ninth California consulate in Oxnard in 1987 
because of the local influx of Mexican nationals in recent years. The increased 
demand for consular assistance helped create the only real controversy of 
Arroyo's brief tenure. 
</P>
<P>
One late-November day, the line into the consulate was so long that it wound 
down the stairs and out the front door of the transportation center. Shop 
entrances were obstructed and the Border Patrol was apparently called. Agents 
arrested three Mexican nationals waiting to get into her office, Arroyo said. 
</P>
<P>
Top patrol administrators assured her that no more arrests would be made at the 
consulate, Arroyo said. And none have been.

LIFE AFTER LOTTO? SAME AS BEFORE; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY: WINNING THE BIG SPIN FOR SOME HAS MEANT A FEW EXTRA LUXURIES, BUT NO 
GUARANTEE OF GOOD HEALTH OR HAPPINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If he follows his usual Monday-morning schedule, Warrick (Woody) Woodard will 
get up today at 5:30 a.m., report for work at the Port Hueneme naval station 
and settle in at his desk to order supplies for U.S. Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
Not such an unusual way to begin the week -- except that Woodard is a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Woodard, 49, had an amazing streak of luck when he went to the 
state lottery's Big Spin three times in just seven months, winning $1,050,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the Camarillo resident still puts in his 40 hours a week as a Navy 
boatswain's mate. He has to keep working, he said, because he is paying so much 
in taxes on his winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid more money in taxes than I made last year," Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
And Woodard isn't alone among Ventura County residents who have won $1 million 
or more in the lottery. For him and others, being a millionaire is surprisingly 
similar to not being one. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard and his wife, Darlene, enthusiastically agree that the money is 
wonderful financial security. It allowed her to follow him out to California 
from Virginia and consolidate their bi-coastal marriage. But aside from buying 
a couple of new cars and a $250,000 house in Camarillo, they have shied away 
from spending the money. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard, casually attired in blue jeans and a flannel shirt, said he plans to 
continue working until his Navy stint is up in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Then he plans to use the money to travel to Australia and start his own 
construction company. 
</P>
<P>
He is pleased by the idea of owning a business and not having to check in at 
the office every single day, a luxury he can afford only because of the lottery 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really the greatest thing," Woodard said. "It's something that you've 
always dreamed about but can never happen -- -unless you fall into a pot of 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Woodard and his wife said that the pot, divided into equal payments 
over 20 years, would not go that far without careful planning. 
</P>
<P>
They are quick to correct people who assume that winning the lottery is the key 
to material paradise and a profound change of lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Some Ventura County winners seem eager to show that their lives are still 
simple, either because they have chosen to invest rather than spend the new 
riches or because, they note somewhat wryly, that $1 million is not that much 
money these days. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, 18 people have won more than $68 million in the state's 
gambling game. 
</P>
<P>
Many winners refuse to discuss the lottery, fearful that revealing the prize 
will prompt the envy of friends or attract opportunists eager to cut themselves 
in on a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, winners shy away from publicity because so many people from the 
public approach them for business propositions," said Norma Minas, a lottery 
spokeswoman. "Many would just prefer a quiet lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
In Woodard's case, a destitute family he didn't know contacted him and asked 
for money after he won his $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Envious co-workers stopped talking to him. Tensions also rose when friends 
asked again and again to borrow money, Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, 'You don't see 'bank' written on my forehead. It's down the 
street,' " Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Smallwood, 65, of Ventura, was besieged by calls and visits from 
investment companies and real estate agents after he won $1 million in the Big 
Spin about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Smallwood said that other people are more impressed by the money than he 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I meet, we talk about it," Smallwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Other than retiring one year early from his job as a school custodian and 
moving to a bigger house, Smallwood said his life is no different than before. 
</P>
<P>
He still drives the same car. He still spends his spare time sanding and 
painting small pieces of furniture. And he still buys a lottery ticket every 
now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't planned anything big," said Smallwood, lounging in gray sweat pants 
and a white T-shirt while watching a game show one weekday morning. "I just 
prefer a quiet life." 
</P>
<P>
Other winners never got the chance to enjoy the advantages lottery money can 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Romines of Port Hueneme won $9.74 million on a Lotto ticket that her 
husband William bought her for Valentine's Day in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He made the gesture after she complained that he always forgot the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
She was elated by the win and made plans to travel, said Linda Romines, a niece 
by marriage. 
</P>
<P>
But Kathleen Romines, 62, only lived to see one of the $487,000 checks from the 
winnings that would be paid in 20 annual installments. 
</P>
<P>
She died of cancer in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
William Romines, 64, didn't have much time to enjoy the money either. He died 
of a massive heart attack four months later -- two weeks after the second check 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Now the money will go to the couple's 10 heirs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it really made too much of a difference in their lives at 
all," said their nephew, John Romines Jr. 
</P>
<P>
For Shirley and Milton (Zeke) Zeitzmann, also of Port Hueneme, her 
million-dollar trip to the Big Spin meant a chance to buy gifts for their 
children, set up trust funds for their grandchildren and take a couple of extra 
trips to Las Vegas each year. 
</P>
<P>
The Zeitzmanns, who grew up during the Depression, said they handle their new 
money conservatively, investing almost all of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living on what we did before I won the lottery," said Shirley Zeitzmann, 
68. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout their almost 44 years of marriage, the Zeitzmanns have never owned a 
credit card, and paid cash for all their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Zeke Zeitzmann, 69, still sells homemade clocks at swap meets and comparison 
shops before buying anything. 
</P>
<P>
He recently refused to pay $2 for a light socket at a hardware store, searching 
until he found the mechanism on sale for under $1. 
</P>
<P>
The two said they have no inclination to move out of the modest, one-story, 
light green house they have called home for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the couple, who moved 17 times during Zeke Zeitzmann's career in the 
Navy, wish to jet off to exotic lands. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Zeitzmann wears her gold lottery pin every day and said she feels sorry 
for people who only manage to win $20,000 or so. 
</P>
<P>
"When people ask me what I intend to do, I say, 'Live long enough to cash my 
last check,' " Shirley Zeitzmann said.

POLICE OFFICER FATALLY SHOOTS ARMED SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer fatally shot a man who pulled a knife as the officer 
attempted to detain him early Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Derek Diaz and Timothy Zetterlund responded to a report of an auto 
theft in progress in the 4600 block of Hawley Boulevard at 12:30 a.m. They 
encountered three men, one of whom was "obviously armed with a large knife," 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the men were walking on the sidewalk, and Zetterlund told them to lie 
down, which they did. The third man, Gregory J. Markley, ran into the street in 
front of the police car. Diaz ordered him to stop and put his hands on the 
patrol car, said Dave Cohen, a San Diego Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was acting very nervous and suspicious, and the officer, who had his 
gun drawn, told him, 'I think you're armed, don't move your hands from the car, 
don't do anything sudden,' " Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Markley) then took his hands from the car and turned away from the officer 
and moved his hands toward his waist area," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, standing about 5 feet away, then fired once, hitting Markley in the 
chest. Markley, 27, was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
"This individual knew that this was a police officer and had his gun out and 
told him not to move, and he did what he did and it cost him his life," Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A knife, with a blade of "at least six inches," was found at the scene, along 
with a set of bolt-cutters, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The other men were questioned, but neither has been arrested, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Markley, a transient, had apparently broken into a car parked in the driveway 
of a nearby house, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Police Department policy, Diaz, who has been on the police 
force since May, 1987, has been assigned to administrative duty until the 
district attorney determines if the shooting was justifiable.

Jerry Harmon looks like a typical middle-management type in his proper blue 
suits, white shirts and conservative ties. But, beneath that button-down 
exterior, he's a revolutionary who is about to turn Escondido around and march 
it back to its youth. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido city councilman has a plan to convert the city's sewage into a 
cash crop that will give Escondido $1 million to $2 million a year to spend on 
acquiring land on the city's fringes and elsewhere, land where orchards and 
citrus groves again can thrive as they did a century ago. Only this time on 
reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon concedes that it may appear that his plan is too good to be true. His 
critics say it is. 
</P>
<P>
His plan is to convert waste into dollars by purifying the city's sewage water 
and treating it to a point that it can be used for everything but drinking. 
This commodity, which Escondido now discharges down a pipeline and into the 
ocean off Cardiff, could bring in millions of dollars if sold to farmers at 
cut-rate prices, Harmon contends. 
</P>
<P>
Those dollars would be used to acquire more land -- both inside and outside the 
city -- to create a greenbelt similar to those around European cities. But, 
more important, it could halt the urban development which is slowly spreading 
from the valley floor up into the foothills that surround the inland North 
County community. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at a satellite photograph of the Los Angeles basin and saw 
'suburbia.' If you could see that map, you would know what suburbia means," 
Harmon said. "From 450 miles up, there is not a speck of green. It is 
completely urbanized. You can't tell where one city ends and the next begins. 
Even the Los Angeles River is a concrete ditch." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County, on the other hand, still has undeveloped land, especially 
inland. Harmon has set out to save what's left from the developer's earthmovers 
because Harmon is an environmentalist and a slow-growth advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use the income stream from sale of reclaimed water to buy up as much 
vacant land as we possibly can, we keep it out of the free marketplace and 
prevent developers from speculating on it," he explained. Otherwise, without 
public land acquisition, water reclamation would be growth-inducing by 
providing additional supplies of that finite commodity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For every gallon of reclaimed water produced for irrigation or flushing 
toilets, a gallon of potable water is saved, he explained. "I looked at this 
carefully and concluded that it would hurt me (by providing water for 
additional development), unless we follow through and take a vital commodity 
for development -- land -- out of the marketplace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to plow new ground here," Harmon said. "We are trying to 
catch up with what has started elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Monterey has been reclaiming sewage water for years, as have other Northern 
California communities, Harmon said. A series of water reclamation plants at 
Whittier, Pomona, Long Beach, Cerritos and Whitter Narrows cleanses huge 
quantities of sewage water for use by industry, he points out. 
</P>
<P>
For 14 years, Harmon sat on the five-member Escondido City Council as the lone 
vote against annexations and development while the city doubled in population. 
Then, two years ago, two like-minded council members were elected and, as 
Harmon put it, "now I'm leading the parade." And he is leading it back to a 
slower-paced, environmentally sensitive lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is convinced he has found a way to make his environmentalist ideas pay. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan not only makes good environmental sense, it makes good business 
sense, too," Harmon explained. "The Chamber of Commerce (not one of Harmon's 
backers) is always saying that government should be run in a more businesslike 
way. And, that is what I am proposing: to preserve a precious commodity -- 
water -- and make money in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon has a report from an independent engineering firm that found that 
Escondido can use all of its reclaimed water within the city boundaries. The 
Engineering Sciences report also found that the cost of creating new reservoirs 
and miles of dual piping to distribute the reclaimed water is economically 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"Business people, including my loyal opposition all these years, Jim Rady, are 
going to see the good sense of this plan," Harmon said. "But when Rady first 
hears of this, he is going to hit the ceiling. If, in two, three, four years 
down the road, he has a plurality elected to the council like I did, he will 
have a tough time overturning what I am going to put in place for him to 
enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
To Rady, the former Escondido mayor who did not run for reelection in the 1988 
when Harmon's star rose, the plan to turn the city's sewage into an income 
stream is "anything but realistic." If it were such a good deal, Rady said, 
"then everyone would have done it by now." 
</P>
<P>
Rady views Harmon's plan as a ruse to prevent the much-needed expansion of the 
city's ocean outfall off Cardiff, a needed expansion to handle increased sewage 
flow expected from Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can convince people that he is going to reduce the city's sewage flow 
down to the outfall to a trickle so that the expansion isn't needed, he will 
have an effective weapon to stop growth and development in this city," Rady 
said. "I think that's his primary goal." 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman Doug Best, who is running against Harmon in the first 
direct election for mayor in June, also questions Harmon's motives. He contends 
that Harmon is advancing the water reclamation plan to curry favor with "the 
coastal voters" in preparation for a bid for a state Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Rady concedes that reclamation is a good idea. When he ran the city before the 
slow-growth troika headed by Harmon took over, the council was looking at a 
deal to sell millions of gallons of its sewage water to a neighboring sewage 
district, which would treat it and use it on golf courses and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
It was that deal and the immediate need to expand the ocean outfall that got 
Harmon moving on his water reclamation plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If others were willing to pay us for something we are just throwing away down 
a pipeline to the ocean, then it only makes sense that we do the same thing 
here," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said he has talked to environmental groups along the coast about his 
idea to reduce Escondido sewage flows off their ocean beaches rather than to 
enlarge the outfall and has found them very receptive. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is to quit alienating the people on the coast. We can do that by 
reducing the amount of effluent we dump into the ocean," Harmon said. "I am 
saying to them, 'Don't sue us,' which I think they have the right to do, for 
one reason because we dump our waste without removing the viruses and bacteria. 
It's bound to have an effect on tourism, which is their lifeblood on the 
coast." 
</P>
<P>
Escondido had planned to expand its ocean outfall capacity -- a $7 million 
project -- but coastal residents are demanding that the city extend its outfall 
to the edge of the Continental Shelf -- a $24 million task -- to prevent 
contamination of the recreational waters offshore and the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, although lauding Harmon's water reclamation plan, believe 
it is too little and too late. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido's sewage flows are increasing dangerously to near capacity of its 
land pipeline and ocean outfall, said David Winkler of the San Elijo Lagoon 
Conservancy, producing sewage spills that have contaminated ocean shellfish and 
degraded the quality of the lagoon environment. 
</P>
<P>
To continue to cause major environmental damage to the lagoon and ocean while 
implementing an untested water reclamation project is not an acceptable 
alternative to Winkler because it leaves the short-term possibility of 
land-line failures, which would pollute San Elijo Lagoon, and more ocean 
pollution from increased sewage flows through the ocean outfall. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler and Richard McManus, an attorney and spokesman for People for a Clean 
Ocean, say the problem has not yet reached the lawsuit stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think he (Harmon) is a very earnest man, and I support his plan 
wholeheartedly," McManus said. But he is not sure that the reclamation project 
will resolve the problems that Escondido sewage is causing the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Escondido city leaders are intent on reclaiming the city's sewage 
instead of dumping it in the ocean, there are other levels of bureaucracy to be 
hurdled, including the Regional Water Quality Control Board, and other state 
and federal water and environmental watchdog groups, McManus noted. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Blick, a friend of Harmon and attorney for a number of developers, 
acknowledges that the far-reaching reclamation plan is "a wonderful concept," 
but echoes the reactions of others that it seems too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have enough information about it to determine if it will work or not, 
but it is a fantastic concept," Blick said. "However, I have no evidence that 
it would be profitable." 
</P>
<P>
However, San Diego County is entitled legally to only a small portion of its 
current supply of imported water, Blick pointed out, and the guarantee of an 
uninterrupted water supply for land might boost the value of that land to a 
level that would make such an ambitious reclamation effort economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Frauenfelder, deputy San Diego city manager who is handling that city's 
plans to recycle at least half its sewage flows by the year 2010, has a problem 
with Harmon's financial analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Even with federal grants and other subsidies, purifying sewage water to federal 
standards is expensive, far more costly than importing water, Frauenfelder 
said. He estimated that treatment and distribution costs for recycled water 
would be about $630 an acre-foot. That contrasts with a $250 to $300 an 
acre-foot cost for imported potable water in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dudek, a principal in the engineering firm of Dudek &amp; Associates, who 
specializes in water reclamation, raises an eyebrow at the prospect of profits 
from Escondido's sewage recycling project, but wholeheartedly supports Harmon's 
efforts to initiate it. 
</P>
<P>
He has done water plans for Poway, Carlsbad and other North County communities 
and finds that "some look good and some look bad" in water-reclamation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The trend is for increasing constraints on imported water, higher costs for 
importing water and more restrictive regulations by state and federal agencies 
on the quality of water discharges, Dudek explained. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted a time, not too distant, when Escondido and other inland cities 
will be required to treat their sewage to tertiary levels -- the levels Harmon 
is now proposing -- before it can be dumped into the ocean, or anywhere else 
for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are going to have to treat it to that extent anyway, then why pour it 
down the drain?," Dudek asked. "Escondido is just a step ahead in the process 
and, because of its location and surrounding (undeveloped) lands, I think it 
has a better shot at water reclamation than some more urbanized areas." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said he is looking for feedback, for criticism that might reveal any 
chinks in his plan. He is also confident that he can amend the reclamation 
program to meet any criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
The first complaint he expected to hear was that he planned to acquire large 
tracts of property as public land, taking them off the tax rolls and causing 
budgetary crises in affected cities, school districts and other governmental 
agencies. Harmon has an answer for that one: 
</P>
<P>
"We would lease out a certain amount of these public lands for agricultural or 
recreational uses. Then we would use a portion of the lease revenues to keep 
(property) tax revenues up to at least present levels." 
</P>
<P>
Leasing of the property he plans to acquire would have a double benefit by 
providing subsidies to replace lost tax revenues and by assuring customers for 
Escondido's reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
"We would require lessees to buy a certain amount of reclaimed water as a 
condition of their leases," Harmon said. "And, in return, we would provide them 
with a guaranteed supply of water during the term of their long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
"In Southern California, where water is like 'liquid gold,' a guaranteed supply 
of water is a very valuable asset," Harmon said.

DISTRICT RUNS 1ST COUNTY PRESCHOOL FOR MIGRANTS 
</P>

<P>
For many migrant families working in Ventura County, the end of the harvest 
season brings not only an end to jobs but an end to the education of their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Children of migrant workers who return to Mexico until work is available in the 
United States may be out of the classroom for as much as a year at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"These students are having great difficulty when they move and come back," said 
Lenna Reyes, coordinator for migrant education for the Moorpark Unified School 
District. "Over half have to be retained in kindergarten." 
</P>
<P>
To help, the district runs Ventura County's first fully funded preschool solely 
for children of migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if help is given early enough, it will make a difference in a 
child's ability to be successful in kindergarten and the first grade," Reyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The initial $25,000 funding for the preschool, Reyes said, came from a special 
project fund for migrant education, consisting of federal money disbursed by 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
One teacher and an aide teach 26 children from ages 3 to 5, who are enrolled 
free of charge in weekday classes from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. The room, 
transportation and other services are donated by the Moorpark Unified School 
District, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Migrant Education Program receive tailor-made instruction that 
can help their transition into kindergarten, in addition to learning math, art, 
writing skills and how to follow directions, said Sylvia Bravo, the migrant 
preschool's teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is total Spanish," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that it's important "for them to feel comfortable with their own 
language. What these kids will find is a bilingual kindergarten. So they will 
be picking up English within the class." 
</P>
<P>
There is now a waiting list, and a second class is planned next year, Reyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Justina Orajeda volunteers once a week in the classroom where her 4-year-old 
daughter, Roseo, is enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it because when" the students "go to kindergarten, they understand it 
much better," said Orajeda, a 14-year Moorpark resident who works in Fresno 
each summer picking peaches. 
</P>
<P>
Orajeda said that Roseo is her only child out of six to go to preschool, and 
that the program is good because she is "learning how to count in English and 
Spanish . . . how to get along with others." 
</P>
<P>
"I love being in school," Roseo said. "I paint art . . . rainbows. And then I 
draw flowers and then I eat." JEFF SCHNAUFER

CARTOGRAPHERS PURSUE THE IDEAL EARTH MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sculptor Tom Van Sant didn't like the look of a satellite photo map of the 
lower 48 states that hung in his Santa Monica studio. "Raw beefsteak," he 
called it. 
</P>
<P>
The map seemed rich in detail -- the Mississippi River looked like an artery 
winding through the country -- but the colors were askew. In the farm belt, 
where the vegetation should be lush with greens and browns, the dominant color 
was red because the infrared system common to satellite photography is 
sensitive to temperature rather than light. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant also objected to what wasn't in the map. "Look at how Mexico and 
Canada are cut off as though they don't exist," he said. "Nobody's dealing with 
the whole problem." 
</P>
<P>
The whole problem, as he puts it, is the Earth. The National Geographic Society 
figures that 200 world maps have been developed in the past couple of 
centuries, but they are essentially scientific drawings, with dots for cities, 
and countries or continents painted in different pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been plenty of satellite photo maps of cities and 
countries, no one has taken on the complex project of assembling from satellite 
pictures a mosaic image that shows a single, clear, composite photo for a flat 
map of the Earth. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
It is a complicated process because a single satellite photo, for all its 
detail, shows only a portion of the Earth. To get a complete image of the Earth 
it is necessary to piece together, like a jigsaw puzzle, many pictures. Finding 
the right pieces is all the more exhausting because two-thirds of the Earth is 
usually covered by clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant, a map fanatic, was surprised no one had taken on the challenge. With 
the help of Lloyd Van Warren, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory computer graphics 
technician, Van Sant has spent the past year sorting through thousands of 
satellite pictures to find enough clear views of land to assemble a clear 
satellite photo of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Their final world satellite map was completed in March and will be unveiled at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., on April 17. "We've 
pursued this project with a vision of allowing people to have a beautiful and 
straightforward image of the world," Van Sant says. 
</P>
<P>
He is not the first map maker to devise a new window to the world. The Greeks 
were drawing maps of the world, such as they knew it, in 550 BC. Now, with 
satellite photographs and vast computerized data bases, there are no secrets 
about shorelines, the true shapes of continents or what the Earth actually 
looks like. 
</P>
<P>
But map makers keep designing new world maps because of the challenge of 
converting an image of a sphere onto a flat piece of paper, what cartographers 
call a projection map. "People like to come up with new projection maps now and 
again to try and forge their immortality," says Robin Orr, cartography director 
for John Bartholomew &amp; Son, a 150-year-old publishing house in Edinburgh, 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the effort, the design is necessarily imperfect. "You can't take a 
round Earth and put it on a flat piece of paper without some distortions," said 
John Garver Jr., the National Geographic Society's chief cartographer. 
</P>
<P>
So map makers, like tailors, customize their work -- taking in a tuck here, 
letting out a bulge there. World maps come in rectangles, ovals, butterflies, 
hearts, ellipses, stars, triangles, even stretched out like an accordion. 
</P>
<P>
The most celebrated design is a rectangular world map conceived by Flemish 
cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. The map's signature is an exaggeration 
of northern land masses which are so swollen that Greenland, for instance, 
appears roughly the same size as North America when it is actually less than 
one-fourth the continent's size. 
</P>
<P>
A different view of the world is found in the north polar azimuthal equidistant 
projection, first devised by Frenchman Louis des Mayerne Turquet in 1648. In 
this map it appears as if the viewer is hovering over the North Pole with the 
rest of the Earth falling away in a circle, with North America on one side, 
Asia on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant finds his project grabbing attention within the map-making community. 
The National Geographic Society wants to publish his satellite map in its atlas 
or perhaps in one of its magazines. 
</P>
<P>
His satellite map is part of a far more elaborate project to create a globe 21 
feet in diameter with a satellite photo glued to its surface. In his studio 
sits a prototype that he hopes to finish by May. Each globe will have interior 
lighting to picture city lights as the regions shift from day to night, while 
the globe spins on a motorized base to simulate the Earth's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
To recreate the image of the Earth as it appears from space, Van Sant will 
mount a second sphere five-eighths of an inch above the globe on which the 
world's weather patterns will be projected. Weather satellites, he says, will 
feed data to four projectors so weather patterns can be constantly updated, 
accurate within 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In typical satellite pictures, the colors are translated according to 
temperature: Pale blue, for example, is not the color for the sea, it's the 
color for asphalt, parking lots, industrial sprawl. But Van Sant repainted his 
satellite photo to capture the Earth's subtle shades, from the light green 
algae in oceans to the rich golds, browns and tans of arid areas. 
</P>
<P>
He imagines his globe as the centerpiece of a studio, with schools, museums and 
television networks as customers. Money has been a problem. NASA and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have advanced some modest 
contributions, but most of the project's cash, Van Sant says, has come from his 
$200,000 savings. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures he used were taken by satellites operated by the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration. The satellites follow a polar route -- north to 
south -- and with the Earth spinning below them, after enough orbits the 
satellites have blanketed the globe while transmitting pictures in digital 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant hunted though thousands of photo negatives at a government library 
before buying about $10,000 worth of satellite computer tapes. The tapes were 
filled with seven days of photos taken over two years and picked because on 
those days the cloud cover was thin. 
</P>
<P>
He assembled one cloud-free composite photograph by laying photos of the same 
spot of the Earth on top of each other in a graphics computer. Piece by piece, 
bits of land were revealed. The final picture will be printed on 36 strips of 
ultra-thin film paper, then stretched onto his globes. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing the flat map, however, requires another step. Van Sant has been 
working on two pictures. One is a three-dimensional photograph of the Earth 
that will be printed in 36 strips and then glued onto his globe. That picture 
will give the truest image of what the Earth looks like. But to have a picture 
that fits onto a flat piece of paper for his world map, Van Sant's computer had 
to convert the three-dimensional image into a rectangular shape, much like the 
old Mercator design. 
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of geography teachers, the Mercator remains the most common world 
map sold in American bookstores. When the spokeswoman at the State Department 
in Washington takes the podium, the Mercator map is her backdrop. "The Mercator 
is something people have burned inside their minds. For them it's the way the 
world is supposed to look," says Garver of the National Geographic. "But the 
Mercator map was never intended to be used as a world political map." 
</P>
<P>
Mercator's remarkable invention solved the problem of long distance travel. 
Navigators can draw a straight line in any direction on his map and it will 
represent a constant compass heading. But to manage that, the farther a point 
is from the Equator the more Mercator stretched and exaggerated the land 
masses. In the 1700s, as European nations expanded their empires by sea power, 
the Mercator was such an essential navigational tool that it slowly became 
accepted as the view of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The National Geographic Society, which distributes 11 million world maps each 
year, does its best to make people forget the Mercator by endorsing other 
designs. In 1922 the Society picked a pumpkin-shaped map by a Chicago engineer, 
Alphons van der Grinten, who lessened some of Mercator's distortions. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the Society settled on "a more realistic" world map developed by 
Arthur Robinson, a retired cartographer from the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, now 75, developed his map in 1963. "I decided there ought to be 
another way of balancing out the various distortions without doing it 
mathematically," he said. So Robinson tinkered with a map to design "the best 
portrait that I could," then worked out the mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
His map is elliptic, "to give the impression it's a round Earth we live on," 
Robinson says. He drastically shrank the Soviet Union, which appears more than 
twice its relative size on Van der Grinten's map; on Robinson's map the country 
is a mere 18% bigger than its proportional size. But he was democratic in his 
tailoring: he shrank the United States so it appears 3% smaller than its "true" 
size. 
</P>
<P>
The National Geographic Society hailed the Robinson map as a great step 
forward, and the Pentagon keeps a Robinson map in its briefing room. But 
despite the Society's imprimatur, the map has not caught on everywhere. In 
Scotland, John Bartholomew &amp; Sons decided to stick with its 35-year-old 
world map, saying the Robinson makes no great improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Even some Americans objected to the Robinson map. Garver was flooded with 
letters by admirers of the late R. Buckminster Fuller, the engineer and 
inventor with a fondness for geodesic domes, who developed his own, predictably 
distinctive, map in 1943 called the Dymaxion AirOcean World Map. 
</P>
<P>
The Fuller map is centered on the North Pole with the rest of the land areas 
spilling out in several directions, resembling a skinned animal. He laid out 
his map in 22 triangles so that if it were cut it would more or less fold into 
a globe. "It's the only flat map without distortion in size or shape of any 
land areas," says Fuller admirer Kiyoshi Kuromiya. But the printing on Fuller's 
map runs in dozens of directions, requiring the reader to constantly rotate the 
map. Robinson says: "As a world map it's a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
For Americans, perhaps the most startling design is a series of upside-down 
world maps. Stuart McArthur, a cartographer in Melbourne, Australia, had been 
frustrated that most maps place the Northern Hemisphere on top. In 1979 
McArthur got his revenge, completing a map in which Down Under is up yonder. 
</P>
<P>
In the world according to McArthur, Australia is smack in the top center, with 
South America off to the left, shaped like a turkey drumstick that points up 
toward Antarctica. McArthur has sold 190,000 maps -- to Japanese tourists, the 
Soviet Union, Great Britain, New Zealand. Robinson says upside-down maps "seem 
funny simply because we're so used to another orientation. But there isn't any 
up or down in space." 
</P>
<P>
Of all recent world maps, none matched the impact of one unveiled by West 
German Arno Peters in 1973. Map makers accused him of lies, distortions, even 
plagiarism. Still, 17 million copies of the Peters map have been sold in six 
languages and it is especially popular in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Peters got the idea when writing a history book and was dismayed that other 
volumes emphasized major countries while overlooking many smaller nations. He 
wanted to include an atlas but, Peters said, "I found they all lie. I wanted to 
have a map of equality and I had to put it together myself." 
</P>
<P>
He set out to overcome what he says is the European bias of map makers, dating 
back to Mercator, which exaggerates the Northern Hemisphere's prominence. If 
nothing else, Peters' map looks radical, the continents slim and elongated as 
if Amedeo Modigliani painted them. Africa and South America seem especially 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' is an equal-area map, so-called because the land masses are correct in 
their total size relative to each other. Every map maker must choose a true 
point of reference -- in Peters' map this is a line running parallel to the 
Equator halfway between the Equator and the North Pole -- and the farther from 
that line, the more distorted are the land shapes. Peters picked this reference 
point in an attempt to balance out the polar distortions on his map, but Africa 
and South America ended up being so distorted that many cartographers despise 
his map. Scholars, including Robinson, have pointed out that Peters' map is 
virtually identical to one devised 135 years ago by a clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson doubts there are any innovations left in projection maps. "We've got 
enough," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant, of course, sees his satellite map as a major breakthrough. "It's the 
first new map of the world in a few hundred years," he says. "There will be no 
reason for anyone else to do one."

HERPES DRUG TREATS CHICKENPOX

<P>
A drug used to treat genital herpes has been found to speed up children's 
recovery from chickenpox, a University of Minnesota study says. Acyclovir 
reduced the number of itchy blisters and shortened by a day the normal five-day 
course of chickenpox in 50 Twin Cities children who received the drug, 
according to a report in this month's Journal of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
Acyclovir is "a safe and effective treatment" for the illness, which almost 
every American gets sometime during childhood, said Dr. Henry Balfour, the 
pediatrician who headed the study. 
</P>
<P>
Balfour said the finding is important because most complications develop near 
the end of a typical five-day infection. 
</P>
<P>
He said some doctors may delay prescribing acyclovir until results of a larger, 
10-city study are released, probably later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other doctors may limit the use of acyclovir to youngsters 11 and older, who 
tend to have the most severe cases of chickenpox, Balfour said. But he 
predicted that its use eventually will be widespread.

SEARCH NARROWS FOR GENE CAUSING MUSCLE ATROPHY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists reported last week that they have tracked down a genetic defect 
underlying an inherited muscle disease that strikes thousands of children 
worldwide. After a three-year search, a research team from Boston and New York 
said it has located the approximate site of the gene responsible for chronic 
spinal muscular atrophy. 
</P>
<P>
The finding paves the way for therapies for the now untreatable disease, which 
causes progressive weakness and wasting of muscles. 
</P>
<P>
The disorder and similar childhood spinal muscular atrophies are the leading 
cause of infant death from an inherited defect, and rank second only to cystic 
fibrosis as the most common type of inherited disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The chronic form of the disease, which usually appears between the ages of 6 
months and 17, has symptoms ranging from mild muscle weakness to inability to 
walk to premature death. It affects about 1 in 24,000 children worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
A more severe type of the disorder, which is about as common as the chronic 
form, is usually fatal before age 2. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the journal Nature, researchers from Tufts University 
medical school in Boston, New England Medical Center and Columbia University in 
New York said the genetic defect that causes chronic spinal muscular atrophy is 
apparently located on the "long arm" of Chromosome 5.

CUL-DE-SACS HELP TURN AROUND HIGH CRIME AREAS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY STREETS: DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ARE REDUCED WHEN BARRIERS 
ARE INSTALLED, POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles authorities may be in the process of disproving the political maxim 
of Philadelphia's controversial former mayor, Frank Rizzo, who once noted that 
the streets in his city were safe; it was people who made them unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
In recent experiments, police officials have built concrete barricades in 
crime-ridden Los Angeles neighborhoods, turning streets into cul-de-sacs. 
Changing the streets, it turns out, appears to reduce random crimes, drug 
transactions and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Police in the San Fernando Valley began closing off streets in neighborhoods 
several years ago. But now, police are trying to expand the concept through 
Operation Cul De Sac, which started on Feb. 1 in the Newton area downtown, 
considered a crime "hot spot." 
</P>
<P>
A top police official is impressed enough with the initial results that he 
envisions possibly restricting access to entire communities, thereby 
discouraging crime and making it easier for police to trap criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The city has an architect drawing up plans to redesign what are now 
unattractive concrete barriers into more aesthetically pleasing, landscaped 
barricades that could be left in place permanently. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to know how successful the use of cul-de-sacs would be 
on a large scale, the results of experiments are promising, according to Robert 
Vernon, assistant chief and director of the Office of Operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have accidentally stumbled on something," he said. "We may need to 
re-engineer the city streets." 
</P>
<P>
The first experiment took place three years ago at Park Parthenia in the 
Devonshire District of the Valley, a drug-dealing center that came to be 
nicknamed "blood alley." 
</P>
<P>
Then last year, another barricade was placed at Willis Avenue and Blythe Street 
in Van Nuys, which meant anyone committing a crime on Blythe in the three-block 
stretch between Van Nuys Boulevard and Willis would have to turn around and go 
out the way they came in. 
</P>
<P>
Sawhorse barricades have been erected temporarily in many areas around Los 
Angeles to cut down on narcotics traffic, but the street in the Van Nuys 
neighborhood has been completely sealed off by the blockades, which remain 
after a year. 
</P>
<P>
Cars can drive around a sawhorse, but the barricade turns them back. 
</P>
<P>
"The barricade has been more than 60% effective in cutting down narcotics 
traffic," said Sgt. Harry Mauk. 
</P>
<P>
Foot patrols were added after the barrier went up. But Mauk said the barricade 
has been successful even without the patrols. Drive-by shootings in the area 
have declined dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying we've stopped drive-by shootings, but we've stopped them 
there," Mauk said. "You can't do an effective drive-by shooting if you have to 
turn around and come back." 
</P>
<P>
Following that experience, according to Vernon, police have created two 
cul-de-sacs in a 30-square-block section of the Newton area near Jefferson High 
School as part of the six-month Operation Cul De Sac experiment, which includes 
foot patrols and small barriers on other streets in an ambitious attempt to 
expand the street-closing concept. 
</P>
<P>
Newton is an ideal place to test the idea. In the 30-square-block area, there 
were 37 drive-by shootings and 112 violent assaults, and 100 murders in the 
overall area in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon said the results in the Newton area have been promising. Two weeks into 
the program, drug czar William J. Bennett toured the area and praised the 
ambitious anti-crime effort. Since the program started, aggravated assaults 
have dropped 45% in the area. But because the program in the Newton district 
only started in February, the true reduction is probably even steeper, he said. 
There have been no drive-by shootings since the cul-de-sacs were built and the 
foot patrols began. There were five shootings in the same area during the same 
time period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 125 students have returned to Jefferson High School since the 
enforcement effort began because they feel safer, said Principal Philip 
Saldivar. 
</P>
<P>
"Sgt. George Gascon, who coordinates the project, reports that two students, 
who out of fear had not gone to school for six months, returned to school," 
according to a report on the operation released by Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more spectators at athletic events" because people feel more 
comfortable, Saldivar said. 
</P>
<P>
Saldivar said some of this is due to the presence of foot patrols. But he said 
the cul-de-sacs are also having an impact. Vernon said he is impressed enough 
with the cul-de-sac concept that he thinks the city ought to consider "making 
the whole neighborhood cul-de-sacs." 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any decision would have to be made by the City Council and the 
community. But already, he said, other residents in the area and around the 
city have begun asking that their streets be blocked off. 
</P>
<P>
If this method of crime control is practiced on a large scale, inner-city 
neighborhoods could some day look like suburban tracts, with winding, interior 
streets that go nowhere. It might be more frustrating for motorists, but it 
could be a boon to law enforcement, according to Vernon, because police would 
have an easier time trapping criminals. 
</P>
<P>
There are budgetary considerations, however. The foot patrols in Newton used up 
$250,000 in overtime funds in the first two weeks. Erecting one permanent 
barricade in the Valley is costing about $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gay, an assistant to Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, whose district includes 
the Newton area, said the cul-de-sac operation has been successful and has 
added to the sense of community in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get the support in the community to block off more streets, we would 
do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some residents have criticized the sawhorses that were erected to 
discourage drug trafficking, complaining that they looked too militaristic. In 
an effort to make the concept more palatable, Lindsay has asked an architect to 
design an attractive, landscaped barricade that could be permanently located in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department expects to receive the drawings next week, and will send 
them to Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we can beautify and enhance the area the better," Gay said.

DROUGHT DRAINS POPPY PRESERVE OF ITS BLOOM

<P>
If you are thinking about packing a picnic lunch and spending the day amid a 
brilliant display of orange poppies in the Antelope Valley -- think again. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the poppy season has been a disappointment, said 
Bob McAdams, the ranger at the state's Antelope Valley California Poppy 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of rain once again kept most of the orange poppies from blooming on the 
parched hills of the 1,740-acre preserve 13 miles west of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We can cry and groan and moan and it won't change the situation," McAdams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the poppies carpeted the hills in a blaze of color was in 1988 
when the desert received almost 12 inches of rain. By comparison, only 4.2 
inches fell this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Preserve workers are telling the hundreds of people who call from around the 
state that this year's flower harvest is "poor to light." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to entice people to drive hundreds of miles to something they 
will be disappointed in seeing," McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster Chamber of Commerce is giving callers the same bleak message. 
</P>
<P>
Although many will stay away, that probably won't harm the area's economy 
because most visitors bring picnic lunches and leave by dark anyway, said 
Connie Wilson, a chamber spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, on April 1 -- the first big Sunday of the season -- more than 
3,000 people arrived, many with cameras, to look at the poppies. 
</P>
<P>
Some complained, but the visitors are in a good mood compared to those who came 
two years ago after reading a newspaper article. The Los Angeles Times reported 
that the hills were covered with gorgeous blossoms, but the story wasn't 
published until most of the flowers had disappeared, McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
The best poppy viewing this year is along Lancaster Road between Munz Ranch 
Road and the reserve, McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
The ranger was philosophical about the flowers' poor showing this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If the drought doesn't break," he said, "we're going to be worried about more 
than flowers."

ALLEGED LINGERIE THIEF HUNG OUT TO DRY BY NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly went on a pre-dawn panty raid in Koreatown was jailed 
Sunday morning, after neighborhood residents chased him down and held him for 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno Tijunait, 46, was booked on suspicion of theft, a misdemeanor, Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. Paul Von Lutzow said. 
</P>
<P>
Tijunait was being held in lieu of $250 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence was easy to come by, the sergeant said. The culprit left a trail of 
women's lingerie along the 1600 block of South Catalina Street, where he 
dropped several undergarments trying to escape the clutches of angry neighbors 
chasing him through the yards of their apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Tijunait was apparently headed back to his BMW, where officers said they found 
a stash of 48 undergarments and one skirt on the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
Some "evidence" was immediately returned to its owners, Von Lutzow said, but 
"we booked some underwear" as evidence. "I guess he collects them." 
</P>
<P>
It was about 4:30 a.m. when a resident caught Tijunait snatching panties, bras 
and other assorted undergarments off back yard clotheslines, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The witness called for help and "some of the neighbors came out," Von Lutzow 
said. Four men took off on the suspect's trail, catching him and pinning him to 
the ground until police arrived.

2 MILES OF SHORE ARE REOPENED

A two-mile stretch of coastal waters in Long Beach was re-opened Sunday after 
tests revealed that the previously contaminated waters were safe, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But about two additional miles remained off limits pending the results of 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming, fishing, surfing and all forms of water contact had been prohibited 
in all of Long Beach's coastal waters since Friday, when officials found 
abnormally high levels of the bacteria coliform in the water, said Dick Smith, 
the city's hazardous waste operations officer. 
</P>
<P>
Officials speculated that the contamination may have been caused by runoff from 
the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have heavy amounts of precipitation like we had last week, we will 
have these elevated counts," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches in Alamitos Bay and south of Belmont Pier were reopened Sunday, but 
those north of the pier and into the downtown Marina -- about two miles -- 
remained closed pending test results expected today, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Johnson of the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said 
coliform, a bacteria that indicates fecal contamination, could cause illness in 
those who inadvertently swallow ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
"It really would depend on how much water the person swallowed, but (coliform) 
could cause diarrhea or stomach cramps," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The contaminated water did not prevent some from enjoying a Sunday afternoon on 
the beach. Many biked, jogged and flew kites along the coastline and officials 
expected a crowd of 15,000 to turn out for an annual beach festival at the 
Shoreline Aquatic Park.

Magic Johnson scored five of his 19 points during a 19-3 fourth-quarter run 
that lifted the Lakers to a 116-109 victory over the Denver Nuggets Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth straight victory for the Lakers, who now have a four-game lead 
over Detroit in the race for the best record in the NBA and a homecourt 
advantage in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed, 94-87, before the decisive run, which ended with the Lakers 
ahead, 106-97, after a tip-in by A.C. Green with 3:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
Denver pulled within six on a three-point play by Fat Lever, who led Denver 
with 31 points and 11 rebounds, but the Nuggets didn't threaten the rest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy led the Lakers with 28 points and Green had 26 and 18 rebounds. 
Michael Adams scored 22 for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers built theur winning margin by making 29 of 33 free throws. Denver 
made 16 of 19 free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Denver led for most of the first period before the Lakers went up 26-25 on a 
follow shot by Green with 1:47 remaining. But Walter Davis and Lever hit 
consecutive baskets to give Denver a 29-26 lead at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A revised ruling before the start of the second half by referee Hue Hollins 
took a point away from Johnson and the Lakers, which made their halftime lead, 
60-56. 
</P>
<P>
Hollins said a technical foul erroneously was called on Denver's Joe Barry 
Carroll when it should have been a personal foul. Hollins instructed the 
scoring crew to remove the point from the Lakers' total before the start of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers controlled most of the third period, leading 75-63 with 6:22 
remaining. It was still 81-72 with 3:53 to play in the third before Denver went 
on an 18-4 run to lead 90-85 going into the fourth quarter.

BankAmerica Corp.'s decision to collapse its "golden parachute" plan puts it in 
the vanguard of what executive compensation experts and shareholder rights 
activists hope will be a movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're on the cutting edge," said John A. Fischer, a principal in the 
Los Angeles office of Sibson &amp; Co., a human resources consulting firm. 
"We're going to see a lot more sensitivity about executive compensation." 
</P>
<P>
Elimination of the 3 1/2-year-old provision was quietly disclosed last week in 
the proxy of San Francisco-based BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America. 
According to the document, officers covered by the plan "voluntarily 
surrendered their rights to receive benefits under the plan, and the board 
terminated the plan." 
</P>
<P>
The golden parachute program, known more technically at BankAmerica as 
"change-in-control severance agreement plan," was adopted in August, 1986, when 
the institution was drowning in red ink because of bad loans and was under 
siege by a hostile suitor, Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp. It 
provided for payments equal to three times an officer's annual cash 
compensation, plus the value of some stock, should the executive be fired or 
leave after a change of ownership. BankAmerica Chairman and Chief Executive A. 
W. Clausen's cash compensation for 1989 was $1.7 million (including bonuses), 
and Vice Chairman Richard M. Rosenberg, who will succeed Clausen as the firm's 
top executive next month, earned $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Such programs sprang to life during the 1980s takeover wave and were adopted by 
scores of U.S. companies. Shareholders criticized them as costly provisions 
that tended to insulate management and dissuade suitors; rank-and-file workers 
complained that management could walk away in comfort after a takeover, whereas 
they were left hanging out to dry. 
</P>
<P>
Given BankAmerica's dire straits at the time, observers said, the plan was 
viewed as necessary to lure talented executives who otherwise saw no incentive 
in joining the troubled firm. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, BankAmerica has staged an awesome turnaround by trimming 
staff and costs and bolstering its California retail banking operations. For 
1989, it reported a record profit of $1.1 billion. Management has stabilized. A 
spokesman said the golden parachutes were "no longer necessary." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, "management insulation mechanisms" have increasingly come 
under fire, said Donald Crowley, a banking analyst in the San Francisco office 
of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, a brokerage house. As a result, he added, 
shareholders "will view in a positive light" BankAmerica's decision to halt the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of compensation experts said they did not know of other firms 
contemplating the elimination of golden parachutes, but all agreed that 
companies would be wise to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
"Institutional investors are increasingly taking the position that they won't 
support companies (with those plans)," said Sibson's Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Del Webb Corp., a Phoenix-based real estate company, is in the 
midst of a proxy fight with Webcott Holdings, a Los Angeles limited partnership 
formed by a dissident director that is seeking to overturn the firm's executive 
golden parachutes and other anti-takeover provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey of 500 large companies, Towers Perrin Forster &amp; Crosby, 
a New York consulting firm, found that 30% had change-in-control provisions. 
But as the takeover climate has cooled in recent months, the firm has seen a 
slowing in the rate of adoption of golden parachute plans, according to Michael 
J. Halloran, leader of the firm's executive compensation practice. 
</P>
<P>
One compensation consultant said she admires BankAmerica for taking the lead. 
"So often, such programs stack up . . . and no one takes a second look," said 
Robin A. Ferracone, a vice president of Strategic Compensation Associates, a 
Los Angeles consulting firm.

U.S. ATTEMPT TO TAKE ECOLOGY PAYOUT BLASTED

The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund has denounced an apparent move by the U.S. 
Justice Department to send a $4.2-million settlement check to the government 
instead of spending it on environmental work around San Francisco Bay as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed consent agreement with Union Oil Co. of California, a subsidiary 
of Unocal Corp., would settle a suit brought in 1984 by the environmentalist 
group under the federal Clean Water Act for alleged pollution of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club attorneys say they were prepared to charge more than 2,300 civil 
violations had the case gone to court in February. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal agreed to pay $2.72 million to the Trust for Public Land to be used on 
wetlands and other land around the bay; $1 million for a study of 
dredging-material disposal and $500,000 for emergency pollution response. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated March 12, a Justice attorney put the San Francisco District 
Court on notice that "any penalties . . . should be made by check payable to 
the 'United States Treasury.' " 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those cases where we are simply quoting the law," said Amy 
Casner, Justice Department spokeswoman. "We have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club attorney Stephan C. Volker called the move -- the first intrusion 
into the 6-year-old case by Justice -- "preposterous and infuriating." If 
successful, he said, the money would disappear in the "bottomless pit" of the 
federal general fund. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Callender, spokesman for Unocal, called the letter "ambiguous," adding 
that the question is unresolved in the law.

Fox TV Sued Over Sound Quality: Planet Earth Television Inc. of Palm Springs, a 
production company, sued Fox TV Stations Inc. in Los Angeles Superior Court on 
Monday, accusing Fox of providing poor-quality sound for an earthquake benefit, 
"Christmas With the Stars," aired in December. 
</P>
<P>
Planet Earth asked to be compensated for damage to its reputation and lost 
profits. It said distributors refused to handle the second portion of the show 
because of the bad sound associated with the first. Fox, which declined to 
comment on the case, provided audio-mixing and sound services for the telethon.

Suit Claims Defective Seat Belts in Hyundai Excels: The parents of a woman 
killed in a car crash in July filed a wrongful-death suit against the 
manufacturer of the Hyundai Excel in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday, 
claiming the car's seat belt was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
James E. and Jeanine L. Mettee said their daughter, Lisa, had her seat belt 
fastened when she was hurled from her 1988 Excel in a roll-over accident. The 
"two-point seat belt in the car does not . . . restrain the pelvis and prevent 
the driver's ejection," the suit said. Hyundai declined comment. (Filed April

U.S. AGRICULTURE BIOTECH FIRMS CUT GOOD DEALS WITH JAPANESE;

For the past month, Calgene Inc., a Davis, Calif.-based firm specializing in 
genetically engineered plants, has been doing more than just splicing genes. It 
has been grafting business deals as well. 
</P>
<P>
First came the news of a $4-million agreement with Kirin Brewery Co. of Japan, 
announced March 15. And a week ago, the company reported that its researchers 
will genetically engineer disease-resistant vegetables with Sakata Seed America 
Inc. in a deal valued at less than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 3 1/2 years, we've done over $10 million in projects with Japan," 
said Kenneth Moonie, director of product planning for the agricultural 
biotechnology firm. "Some of that money is still being paid out over the next 
couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural biotechnology is a fledgling field in which scientists work to 
genetically engineer plants and animals to create bio-insecticides, 
bio-herbicides, plants resistant to disease and pestilence and treatments for 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese investment in ag biotech is still in its early stages, 
industry watchers say that its growth is rapid and its future is bright. They 
also contend that deals such as Calgene's symbolize the changing nature of 
Japanese-American business relationships -- particularly in the area of 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s -- the nascent stages of Japanese investment in U.S. 
biotechnology firms -- Japanese investors would swoop in with money and out 
with U.S. research and broad licensing rights for future products, said Jim 
McCamant, who edits the AgBiotech Stock Letter and the Medical Technology Stock 
Letter. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they are much more equitable, in part because American companies are 
demanding more than just a quick cash infusion in exchange for their research. 
And they're getting it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the agriculture area, most of the deals being done with the Japanese are 
good ones," McCamant said. "Today, when you look at the deals made with Japan, 
you'd better ask for a lot. It's clear you're apt to get it." 
</P>
<P>
That's just what happened with Calgene in the past month and Mycogen Corp., a 
San Diego-based bio-pesticide firm, in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
On March 15, Calgene and Kirin officials announced that the two firms had 
agreed to launch a joint venture in the field of potatoes. Kirin would pay 
Calgene $2.5 million to purchase 30% of Calgene's seed potato business. The 
joint venture would consist of Kirin's 30% share and Calgene's 70%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Japanese firm agreed to fund a two-year, $1.5-million research 
and development project at Calgene to genetically engineer potato seed, making 
it resistant to disease and such insects as the Colorado potato beetle. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. Kirin also agreed to contribute its own potato propagation 
technology to the joint venture. Moonie called that part of the deal unique, 
and he hasn't gotten much argument about his characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"In deals with the Japanese it's been a one-way street, with technology being 
transferred from the U.S. to Japan," Moonie said. "What the Kirin people are 
providing us with is their production technology, which could revolutionize the 
seed potato industry in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Mycogen is another success story, a firm that Mark Ratner, senior editor at 
Bio/Technology magazine, calls "a leader in truly coming to significant 
agreements with Japanese companies" in the area of ag biotech. 
</P>
<P>
The first was in 1988 with Kubota of Tokyo, a Japanese manufacturer of farm 
equipment, said Jerry Caulder, Mycogen's president, chairman and chief 
executive. As part of the 1988 deal, Kubota agreed to provide $6 million over 
three years for the development of biological insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gave Kubota exclusive rights in the Far East alone to all 
products developed through the collaboration. In addition, Mycogen would 
receive 50% of all product sales. Then in 1989, Kubota invested $10 million in 
the company, making Kubota a 14% shareholder. Mycogen also has a deal with 
Japan Tobacco Inc. for the development of bio-herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
"Mycogen is separated from most (ag biotech companies) in that we didn't do 
contract research," Caulder said. "We would do deals that brought in money that 
augmented our core research projects. I don't think you can build a very large 
profitable business . . . giving away your products for royalties." 
</P>
<P>
Tetsuo Nishide is director of machinery and technology for the Japan External 
Trade Organization in Los Angeles. To Nishide, the increased interest in 
agricultural research is partly due to problems Japanese investors have 
encountered while trying to break into the U.S. pharmaceutical field. 
</P>
<P>
"The agriculture area is one of the perhaps most promising areas," Nishide 
said. Investors "can get fruit from the investment. The medical part, it takes 
time to get the return because of the procedures to get approval for the 
medical products. The agriculture area is the easier way." 
</P>
<P>
But other industry watchers warn that Japanese investment in agricultural 
biotechnology should not be overstated. It's too early, they say, and Japanese 
public opinion is not entirely behind the idea of genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are "very well versed in 'classical' biotechnology techniques, 
especially fermenting," Ratner said. "When it comes to genetic engineering, 
they still have a long way to go in terms of public acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
The government has yet to allow a field test of a genetically engineered 
product, he said. "Public perception of biotechnology is still straight out of 
those '50s science fiction movies, where the animal gets irradiated and turns 
into a giant," Ratner said. "Instead of radiation, they're worried about 
biotechnology."

TRUMP'S MARGIN FOR ERROR ON THE TAJ IS NOT BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald J. Trump may have a lot of things, but it's clear that he doesn't have 
everything. The one thing he obviously doesn't have is shame. Or if he has any, 
he hides it well. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, if you will, Trump's endless boasting about how his Taj Mahal 
casino-hotel in Atlantic City, the biggest and most expensive building ever 
erected in New Jersey, was finished on time and on budget. Trump has made the 
on-time, on-budget claim so many times that he may even occasionally believe it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
But when Trump is out of the limelight and has a legal obligation to tell 
something resembling the truth, he tells a somewhat different story about the 
Taj. In this version, the Taj finished about six weeks behind schedule and has 
a $65-million cost overrun. 
</P>
<P>
And the sure sign that the building's construction didn't work out as Trump 
planned is that he has agreed to wait "at least a year" to take the $10-million 
fee to which he's entitled for finishing the Taj. (Master Builder Trump 
actually paid Perini Corp. $1 million to manage the Taj's construction, but it 
would be churlish to point that out.) 
</P>
<P>
Trump leaving money uncollected? It's a violation of natural law. It's as if 
the sun rose in the west, an investment banker stopped caring about fees or a 
sucker got an even break. 
</P>
<P>
Where do you find this less-than-upbeat version of the way things are in 
Taj-land? In the 1989 annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission earlier this month by something called Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc. 
This obscure corporate creature, 100% owned by Trump, has its name on the bonds 
that were issued in November, 1988, to raise money for Trump to buy the 
partially built Taj Mahal from Resorts International and finish building it. 
</P>
<P>
Because Trump's reports to the Taj bondholders are subject to federal 
securities laws, Trump has a legal obligation to tell the truth in them -- an 
obligation that doesn't apply to his press releases or interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Read the Taj Mahal Funding documents, and you discover that the Taj cost $65 
million more than it was budgeted for a year ago. Of the $65-million increase, 
Trump told Taj bondholders, $11.8 million consists of the interest paid on the 
Taj's bonds between the time the Taj was supposed to open and its actual 
opening date. You can argue that the interest is a bookkeeping item rather than 
a cost overrun -- but it does show that the building was finished late. The 
other $53.2 million of cost increases, Trump says, comes from design changes 
that he believes "will improve operating efficiency as well as the perceived 
and actual quality of the facility." Whatever that means. 
</P>
<P>
This overrun is probably the reason that the Taj, originally scheduled to be 
completed with the proceeds of the $675-million bond issue, has ended up 
borrowing another $50 million from banks. Should the Taj run through the bank 
money as well, Trump himself has to lend the next $25 million to the Taj, under 
terms of his contract with the Taj bondholders. As of Dec. 31, the Taj hadn't 
borrowed any money from Trump, but it may have borrowed some or all of it by 
now. 
</P>
<P>
How does Trump explain these differences between what he tells the public and 
what he told Taj bondholders? Beats me. I couldn't get him on the phone to 
discuss it. Not that it matters much, since Trump is not exactly the most 
reliable interviewee in the world. In our last conversation, he berated me for 
having been foolish enough to believe what he had said in the conversation 
before that one, in which he had sworn up and down that he would never sell 
control of Resorts International to Merv Griffin. No matter what he told me, 
Trump explained, I should have known that when he wants to buy, he acts as if 
he's selling, and that when he wants to sell, he acts as if he's buying. 
</P>
<P>
But even though you can't rate Trump too high on candor, you have to give him 
top marks for nerve. He has not only borrowed $675 million from bondholders and 
$50 million from banks, but he even borrowed the $75 million that he put into 
the Taj as his equity. 
</P>
<P>
How could even Trump do this? Easy. Documents on file at the New Jersey Casino 
Control Commission show that Trump got banks to lend him $75 million against 
money he doesn't have yet: the management fee that the Taj has agreed to pay 
him. Trump gets the fee, 1.75% of the Taj's revenue, provided that the Taj has 
made its interest payments first. The Taj would have to bring in more than $450 
million a year -- or $1.2 million a day -- for Trump to take in enough 
management fees to cover the interest on the borrowed $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that Trump has none of his own money tied up in the Taj, but 
he would have to dig into his own pocket to pay back the $75-million bank loan 
if the Taj goes belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
Does a $65-million overrun and a six-week construction delay mean that the Taj 
Mahal is going to fail? Obviously not. You're dealing here with a project that 
cost something on the order of $1.12 billion -- $870 million of Trump's money 
and $250 million of Resorts International's money. The $65 million is sales 
tax, not a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But the extra $65 million does reduce Trump's margin for error. And it reminds 
us, once again, that when you lend money to a promoter, you damned well better 
read all those boring documents that he files.

FIRST PERSON: WHEN CHILDREN BECOME THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</P>

Dear Miss Manners: 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I had a dinner party the other night, and among the guests was an 
old friend and colleague with whom I have a lot in common. We go way back. It 
was a fine dinner with a small group of people. That is until my 3-year-old 
walked into the room. She was not crying or throwing a tantrum. We didn't break 
out the baby pictures. The problem, at least in the eyes of my friend, was that 
she was there at all. This friend, who, by the way, is married but seems 
committed to having no children of her own, rolled her eyes, squirmed and made 
it clear the presence of a child made her extremely uncomfortable. Well, the 
whole scene made me terribly uncomfortable, in my own home no less, and I 
resent it. Should I write off the friendship? Is it possible for me to maintain 
a friendship with someone who expresses such disdain for my own children? 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
Gentle Reader 
</P>
<P>
I didn't really write to Miss Manners. I drew my own line in the sand and 
concluded that despite our common past, the friendship would never again be the 
same. But the whole episode was deeply disturbing. I resented being put in the 
position of feeling as if I had to apologize for my child. And I don't like 
severing ties. I can count my close friends on one hand, and I let them go 
reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, what I discovered was a Dirty Little Secret about parenthood that 
my mother never shared. Or maybe my mother didn't know. It's about the 
difference between people who have children and those who profess, proudly, 
almost boastfully, that they neither want children nor care to be around anyone 
else's. They hate kids. We can be friends, they'll tell you, but just don't try 
my patience by mentioning your child. You've heard it all before. 
</P>
<P>
All this seems particularly relevant as the baby boomers move into middle age. 
Ours was the generation that waited longer to get married and even longer to 
have children. We concentrated our energies on career and ambition. There 
wasn't time for anything else. I am no exception. I was almost 32 when I 
married and 35 when I became a father. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage, and certainly parenthood, are not for everyone, of course. I know a 
good many people my age -- funny, worldly, interesting people -- who have 
decided to go it alone. They joke about their pets being their kids and spend 
their weekends back East, or at the theater, or at that chic new restaurant on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways I envy them. If I took a trip during the weekend, chances are it 
was to the mall with my daughter. The last memorable movie I saw was "The 
Little Mermaid," and that was because there was a little blonde with a pink 
hair band sitting beside me. It was her first time in a theater. 
</P>
<P>
And if my wife and I ever make it to that restaurant on the Westside, we'll pay 
for it the next morning with a heavy dose of guilt for leaving our adoring 
daughter behind. 
</P>
<P>
Those who trumpet their dislike of children are the ones who groan when a 
mother and her infant sit in front of them on a plane. They wonder why Mom 
can't keep the kid's mouth shut as the plane climbs to 30,000 feet. They shoot 
her scornful looks. I don't like wailing kids on planes or rowdy youngsters in 
restaurants either, but if a 6-month-old wants to cry on a plane, there is 
nothing a mother can do about it. Any parent will tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
All this comes back to the dinner party, and that Dirty Little Secret. 
Professionally, that friend and I still share the same values. We work toward 
many of the same goals, share many of the same ideals. But personally, we have 
become strangers. My friend's work consumes her life, and I suspect she spends 
most of her off hours either talking or thinking about what she's left behind 
the office door. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, I want her freedom and spontaneity, and her ability to focus all her 
mental energies toward the job. I suspect a lot of parents feel the same way. 
But day care, sick children and sleepless nights with a fitful infant have a 
way of changing that. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that you lose the ambition or the commitment to work, but your 
profession finds itself competing with other demons for your time. Is my child 
all right? Am I repeating the mistakes of my father? Did we check out the 
preschool thoroughly enough? Will she resent us for working, for not spending 
enough time by her side? 
</P>
<P>
My childless friends can't understand this, and I suppose I can't expect them 
to. But what they really can't appreciate is how parenthood changes you, 
softens you in some ways, makes you into a different person. 
</P>
<P>
And it hardens you, too. People once willing to turn the other cheek and 
forgive suddenly get very tough on crime once they have a child. Show me a 
convicted child molester and I'll show you 100 parents willing to throw the 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, as a parent you become intolerant, too. Intolerant of those who can't or 
don't wish to understand what it's like on the other side. Yet in my book, 
boasting about hating children makes one at least as intolerant as those of us 
with kids. Don't interrupt my peace! Keep that kid out of the room! 
</P>
<P>
 So there it is, a quandary even Miss Manners probably cannot solve. Maybe 
dinner parties like mine are inevitable. It takes only an instant to realize 
that as far as some friendships are concerned, it's children who draw the line.

SOCIALIZED MEDICINE CUTS CANADA'S COSTS -- AND CARE 
</P>

WINDSOR, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billboards on the riverfront drive in Windsor demand to know "how many more" 
will die under Canada's vaunted health care system. Ads in the newspapers have 
been urging citizens to rally for reforms. 
</P>
<P>
And rally they did on a recent bone-chilling morning, calling for changes in a 
national health plan under scrutiny as a possible model for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want our people dying anymore," said protester Vicki Bondy, a 
volunteer with Heartbeat Windsor, a group that helps Canadians find hospital 
beds in the United States when they cannot get them at home. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized to protest the death of Bondy's nephew, 2-year-old Joel 
Bondy, who needed heart surgery but never got it. Joel's death in February 
offers a window on Canadian health care at its worst: Compared to the United 
States, there is a relative paucity of high-tech health centers here -- and, as 
a result, hundreds of Canadians who need complex treatment ranging from heart 
surgery to organ transplants spend months on waiting lists. Each year, some 
Canadians die while they wait. 
</P>
<P>
But the rally that marked Joel Bondy's death underscored another aspect of the 
Canadian system, something that should be of interest to Americans seeking 
models for change: Even as the marchers deplored the Canadian system's 
downfalls, they were quick to say that it was better than the American way. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade our system for anything in the world," said Andrew Williams, 
a 32-year-old Windsor resident who needed a triple-bypass operation last year, 
waited in vain for 3 1/2 months, then finally gave up and left Ontario province 
for nearby Detroit. "But changing demographics have put strains on this 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Canada established universal health insurance coverage in 1971, although some 
provinces had set up narrower programs of their own even earlier. In designing 
its brand of socialized medicine, Canada did not go nearly as far as Britain, 
which nationalized hospitals and made doctors government employees. It merely 
outlawed private health insurance for virtually all forms of care and enrolled 
citizens in government plans administered by the 10 provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Every Canadian citizen is thus guaranteed access to a doctor at no direct cost. 
He can see any practitioner he pleases. He goes in and out of the hospital, in 
most cases, without ever touching his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how rich or poor you are, what color you are or what side of 
town you live on," said Williams, marching with his sisters just across the 
Detroit River from Detroit. "If your child is sick, you can walk into a 
doctor's office anywhere in Ontario, with no money in your pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, universal health insurance has evolved into Canada's most 
popular social program. Data compiled by the Families USA Foundation in 
Washington show that 7 out of 10 Canadians think their system gives them good 
or excellent care; 9 out of 10 say the health care system here is "one of the 
things that makes Canada the best country in the world in which to live." 
</P>
<P>
When asked in casual conversation to tick off the differences between their 
country and the United States, Canadians almost invariably mention universal 
health insurance as evidence that Canada is the more civilized place. 
</P>
<P>
Since primary care is available at no cost, Canadians do not hesitate to see 
their doctors. Indeed, this is probably one reason Canadians are so healthy. 
Canadian infant mortality, a key measure of a nation's public health, was 9.6 
per 1,000 births in 1981, compared to the American rate of 12.6 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
And not only that: At the same time that Canada provides no-charge treatment 
for all, it has managed to hold down costs. Before Canada had established its 
universal health insurance system, it spent about as much as the United States 
did on health care (7.4% of its gross national product, compared to 7.6% in the 
United States). 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, however, the two countries' rates of spending have diverged, so 
that Canada now spends less than 9% while America spends nearly 12% of its 
gross national product on health. 
</P>
<P>
It is this aspect of Canada's system that has caught the eye of U.S. lawmakers, 
corporate executives and union leaders. For the last 10 years in America, 
health care costs have been rising faster than inflation; now, they are rising 
faster than any other part of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate America foots most of the bill, but insurance premiums have been 
shooting up so fast that a major cost of doing business today has become the 
cost of employee health insurance. Worker health care now adds about $700 to 
the cost of an American car; in Canada, it is believed to add only $223. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. employers have tried to cut back on coverage, labor unrest has 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
"In most of the strikes that have occurred in the last few years, health care 
has been the major issue," said Rod Rogers, a spokesman for the Oil, Chemical 
and Atomic Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
At non-union businesses, meanwhile, some employers have simply dropped coverage 
altogether. An estimated 37 million Americans are without health insurance 
today, including a growing number of middle-income people. Philip Shandler, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, says 
the population of uninsured Americans is growing by 1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The commission spent two years studying ways of reforming the American health 
care system and in early March issued a number of recommendations. One was for 
a "public-private partnership" that would offer some new government health 
insurance assistance but at the same time call on more private businesses to 
cover their workers. Lawmakers are now considering ways to write the 
recommendations into law. 
</P>
<P>
Shandler said the commission considered handing over full responsibility to the 
government, Canadian-style, but decided that it would be too hard to legislate 
such a shift because of "opposition from health care providers, doctors in 
particular." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian doctors bitterly fought enactment of their universal health care 
system, but today they seem happy that they lost the battle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much more comfortable for doctors" in Canada, said Allan Detsky, a doctor 
and economist who studied in the United States and who now heads the internal 
medicine department at Toronto General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In Canada, he pointed out, doctors may not be able to charge as much as they 
could in the United States -- but they don't have to worry about collecting 
bills or arguing with increasingly hard-nosed insurance companies over 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that by eliminating all the paper work and dickering, Canada has 
not only pleased its doctors but also helped hold down costs. Because paper 
work is dramatically simplified -- all bills go straight to the government -- 
it is estimated that Canadians spend less than $20 per capita each year on the 
flow of forms. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, by contrast, spend $95 each on insurance overhead. It has been 
estimated that if the United States were to cut out the paper work the way 
Canada has, the system could save $21.4 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another way Canada holds down its health care costs, and it is a 
lot less attractive: It deliberately limits the spread of the newest, most 
advanced health care technology. Canada may go in for primary medicine in a big 
way -- its medical schools turn out far more general practitioners and 
pediatricians than their U.S. counterparts -- but it scrimps on the 
specializations. 
</P>
<P>
When hospitals here want magnetic resonance imaging equipment, lithotriptors to 
treat kidney stones and other big-ticket innovations, they must include the 
purchase cost in their annual budget proposals to the provincial government. If 
the province rejects the budget, the hospital cannot buy the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Admirers of the Canadian approach say it saves money by encouraging basic 
health care, cutting out duplicative technology and, most likely, reducing 
unnecessary surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Still, detractors of the Canadian system say it was the restrained approach to 
high technology that brought the Bondy family to grief. The Bondys' hometown, 
Windsor, has a population of about 300,000 but it has no specialized cardiac 
surgery unit. Detroit, meanwhile, has nine. In all of Canada, it turns out, 
there are only 11 heart surgery units; the United States has 793. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Bondy's aunt Vicki, who has become a spokeswoman for the family, said the 
child was born with arteries too small to supply oxygen to his body. He had 
surgery when he was 3 months old, but it was not effective, and his parents 
were told that he needed another operation. Because Windsor does not have the 
facilities, Joel's parents put him on a waiting list for surgery in London, 
Ontario, a two-hour drive away. 
</P>
<P>
There are no clear statistics available on average waiting times for high-tech 
treatments in Canada, but doctors say it is commonplace for a patient to 
languish for three to six months before a heart operation, a bed in a cancer 
center, a hip replacement or some other highly specialized treatment. 
</P>
<P>
While the patients wait, their doctors act as their intermediaries with the 
specialized units. In Joel's case, surgery was first scheduled for late 
February, but as the date approached, more urgent patients were moved ahead of 
him. He was bumped back to mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
Joel's anguished parents complained to the local news media, and Heartbeat 
Windsor took up the case. 
</P>
<P>
The group's director, Michael Billett, who is known locally as "the Detroit 
connection," arranged for the child to have surgery across the river in the 
United States. But before Joel could make it over the bridge, Canadian 
officials, deeply embarrassed by the affair, announced that they had found a 
bed for him after all. They urged the Bondys to have the surgery done in 
Toronto, and the Bondys relented. They made the trip to Toronto, but it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"They finally got him in, and he died four hours before surgery was to have 
been performed," his aunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the toddler's death shocked Windsor, where seemingly everybody knew 
about Joel and was rooting for him. Then word leaked out that the Ontario 
government had already forked over about $5 million to the hospitals of Detroit 
to pay the hospital bills of other sick Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
Why, citizens wondered, hadn't those tax dollars been spent building a heart 
unit in Windsor? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I've ever seen an entire city mourn," said Vicki Bondy as 
she surveyed the crowds who came to the march the first weekend in April.

THE INFECTIONS THAT PREY ON THOSE WITH DAMAGED IMMUNE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN TARGETS 
OF LITTLE INTEREST TO RESEARCHERS. THE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON FINDING A CURE FOR 
THE SYNDROME.

<P>
A recent international conference on the status of AIDS drug research here drew 
an overflow crowd of hundreds of medical professionals. But by the final 
morning's session -- one devoted to the infections that prey on people with 
immune systems laid waste by AIDS -- the hall was virtually empty. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected it," said John McGowan, associate director for basic research and 
development for the AIDS division of the National Institute for Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, the leading federal agency in AIDS research. "It didn't 
surprise me at all." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the scientific community, there has been little in the way of basic 
laboratory work or clinical studies toward finding or testing treatments for 
the opportunistic infections that plague and eventually kill most people with 
AIDS. And attracting researchers to the area has been a continuing problem. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of activity reflects a belief held by most of those doing major AIDS 
research: that the greatest advances will come from developing drugs for the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, rather than from drugs 
to treat each infection that accompanies the underlying condition. 
</P>
<P>
Thus there has been a full-court press to discover and study antiviral drugs 
but far less interest in finding treatments for the virulent forms of cancer, 
meningitis, pneumonia and other infections that strike AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
But that attitude is rejected by those who are infected or ill. For them, the 
most pressing and immediate concern is to survive with AIDS as long as possible 
by defeating each infection that develops. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can give us two more years, you'll have two more years where you can 
find your cures," said Mark Harrington of the organization ACT UP (AIDS 
Coalition to Unleash Power). 
</P>
<P>
The situation also frustrates primary care physicians who are on the front 
lines treating AIDS patients, and the National Institute for Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which recently initiated a major push to ignite 
interest in the opportunistic infections arena. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question we need to do more," said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, NIAID 
director and the federal government's director of AIDS research activities. 
</P>
<P>
"From a scientific viewpoint, it's obviously much more interesting and exciting 
to do the antiviral work," Fauci said. "But you also must address the problem 
of what you do for those people who are already infected and whose immune 
systems have deteriorated. This is an issue of major public health importance." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say there are many reasons work in this field has been moving so 
slowly. First, they say, few known drugs are effective against many of these 
infections, which are rare in people with healthy immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
Further, too few basic laboratory scientists or pharmaceutical companies are 
interested in looking for new drugs. The number of diseases involved 
complicates the search, and drug manufacturers often perceive the potential 
market to be quite small and not worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do the new (drug) molecules come from? They come from laboratories or 
companies that get excited about this kind of research," said Dr. Daniel Hoth, 
director of the AIDS division of NIAID. 
</P>
<P>
Hoth said: "Researchers in academia will get excited about testing these drugs 
(in humans) if they sense the challenge is doable, but the major problem is 
that there aren't a lot of drugs out there. The fundamental issue is that we 
need to find new molecules." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers also noted that it would be discouraging to conquer one infection 
with a drug that is available now only to have an infection of a different 
nature strike in its stead. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to put people with AIDS into remission" by finding a way to restore 
their damaged immune systems, said Dr. Robert T. Schooley, an AIDS researcher 
at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Until that happens, Schooley said, "each successfully treated infection will 
add a little bit to life expectancy, but in a lot of ways, it's just exchanging 
one cause of death for another. I wish life were simple enough to believe that 
treating the opportunistic infections would make the disease go away. But it 
isn't." 
</P>
<P>
He likened the situation to leukemia years ago, before therapies were found to 
place that disease into remission. Those afflicted with leukemia also were 
vulnerable to life-threatening infections. 
</P>
<P>
"As the antibiotics got better, we were able to keep people alive longer," he 
said. "But unless we were able to put the leukemia into remission and have the 
immune system returned, the patients would all die of infections anyway. In 
AIDS, the tempo is slower, but the process is the same." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there has been at least one dramatic instance of a drug already 
in use demonstrating a significant ability to extend the lives of AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
That drug is pentamidine, used to treat pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which 
was killing AIDS patients with brutal swiftness. A group of San Francisco 
physicians showed that it can stave off even a first episode of pneumocystis 
carinii when it is taken in aerosol form as a preventive measure. 
</P>
<P>
And now, virtually all individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) whose immune systems have begun to show signs of serious 
deterioration -- placing them at great risk of developing pneumocystis -- are 
advised to take aerosol pentamidine. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a major breakthrough," said Harrington of ACT UP. "It refutes the 
whole argument that we can really save lives only by treating primary HIV." 
</P>
<P>
NIAID, recognizing that too little attention has been paid to opportunistic 
infections, recently initiated several efforts in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The agency plans to sponsor a "drug discovery" group with the single goal of 
looking for new drugs. Such groups have been operating in the antiviral area 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a group involves a partnership of academia, industry and government, 
drawing upon the resources of dozens of drug companies and about 100 different 
institutions. The agency has slated $3 million this year for the work on 
opportunistic infections. 
</P>
<P>
"Should we discover a compound that looks promising, then we will have the 
capabilities to develop it and bring it into human trials," McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
And the agency's community-based AIDS research program, which involves primary 
care physicians who treat AIDS patients, within the next few months plans to 
begin trials of known drugs to determine if they could be used to prevent any 
of the opportunistic infections. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians are eager to participate in this overlooked aspect of AIDS 
research, said Dr. Lawrence Deyton, director of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing on their minds is: How do I keep my patients alive 
longer?" Deyton said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike academic researchers, who are primarily concerned with the behavior of 
the virus and how it affects the workings of the immune system, "doctors in our 
program are primary care providers," Deyton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The scientific questions they are going to ask are going to be of primary 
clinical concern. They're asking different kinds of questions in a different 
setting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"These docs are different in their emotional makeup," Deyton added. "They're 
not as interested in publishing, or in winning the Nobel Prize. For them, the 
rewards are truly exhilarating when they can make these little inroads." 
</P>
<P>
Deyton said that the first trial will seek to find a way of preventing 
toxoplasmosis in the brain, a life-threatening parasitic infection seen with 
increasing frequency in AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
As with other opportunistic infections, many people are exposed to the organism 
that causes toxoplasmosis, but only those with damaged immune systems become 
ill; others who have been exposed to the parasite have developed antibodies to 
it. The trial will seek to identify those at risk and to administer them low 
doses of those drugs usually used to treat the disease after it develops. 
</P>
<P>
"If this turns out to be effective, we're going to be sparing a lot of people a 
very serious infection," Deyton said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar trials will try to prevent mycobacterium avium, or MAI, a 
tuberculosis-like condition that frequently strikes in the later stages of 
AIDS. It is a frequent cause of death and disability in AIDS patients and is 
difficult to treat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain pessimism about MAI because we've known about the organism 
for a long time, but it has so far resisted efforts to find a meaningful 
therapy -- even before HIV disease became common," said Dr. Paul Volberding, an 
AIDS researcher at San Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Gottlieb, the Los Angeles immunologist who identified the first 
AIDS cases in 1981, is planning to conduct his own trial of an 
anti-tuberculosis drug to see if it can prevent the onset of MAI. His work is 
being sponsored by the maker of the TB drug. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb finds himself in an unusual position, having seen both sides of the 
AIDS research dilemma. In the early years of the epidemic, he was affiliated 
with UCLA and took part in antiviral studies. Today, having severed his ties 
with the university, he is in private practice, treating primarily AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Research on the virus itself is the big win," he said. "When I was in academic 
research, like most researchers, I focused on the virus. But now that I'm in 
full-time clinical work, I realize the importance of finding and testing new 
drugs to treat these infections which contribute so heavily to patients' 
suffering. My perspective has changed."

U.S. PLANES HELP MEXICO HEAD OFF DRUGS AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

EL PASO, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From its secret post off the coast of Colombia, the American P-3 radar plane 
found what it was looking for -- a twin-engine Turbo Commander churning its way 
northward, low and slow in the black of night. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian aircraft was following a drug couriers' favorite flight plan: a 
wide turn over the Pacific past Central America, then straight for Mexico and 
landing strips just short of the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
For American sentinels, that course is a source of unending frustration. Every 
day, at least three suspect planes disappear onto remote landing strips in the 
Mexican sagebrush. And from those well-placed staging points, an ant army of 
smugglers has proved more than a match for U.S. border guards. 
</P>
<P>
But on this February night, the American radar plane had license to do 
something never before attempted. 
</P>
<P>
When the Turbo Commander crossed into Mexican airspace, the P-3 followed. Using 
new intelligence channels, it warned Mexican authorities what was coming. By 
the time the smugglers touched down in the town of Monclova, a fledgling 
Mexican response team, guided by the American radar plane, was descending for 
what would be a historic bust. 
</P>
<P>
The take: more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine, three Colombian pilots -- and five 
corrupt cops, two of them Mexican federal judicial police. 
</P>
<P>
The still-classified operation marked the consummation of a marriage long 
sought by American officials: a matchup of American radar sightings and Mexican 
ground forces, operating in a country where U.S. intelligence had previously 
been of little tactical use. 
</P>
<P>
But along a border scarred by decades of feuding, the success in Monclova has 
given only passing comfort to American officials painfully aware of just how 
porous the United States' 1,900-mile Southwestern frontier remains. 
</P>
<P>
Almost overnight, the border has become the No. 1 entry point for cocaine into 
the United States, the weakest link in the drug interdiction campaign. No one 
can agree how the trend might be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican sensitivities about its bullying neighbor to the north remain such that 
the principal American attempt to shore up the border barrier -- the creation 
of the military's Joint Task Force 6 to help guard against smugglers -- 
provoked a near-crippling outcry. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is," a senior Administration official said of the border war on 
drugs, "we're getting our tails kicked down there." 
</P>
<P>
Of the hundreds of tons of cocaine that pour into the United States every year, 
an alarming 70% is now thought to pass through Mexico -- up from 30% just a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to toughen up, the Bush Administration has already taken 
unprecedented steps to expand its surveillance, including the increased use of 
high-technology radars that look deep into Mexican territory. 
</P>
<P>
At least 200 American soldiers now do border-guard duty every week, well-armed 
and well-camouflaged in the Southwest desert. Oklahoma-based AWACS (airborne 
warning and control system) radar planes patrol over the region on 35 missions 
a month. And increasingly, fighter planes as well as Customs Service Cessnas 
are slated to scramble on missions to intercept airborne smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
But as interviews with officials on both sides of the border make clear, it 
remains uncertain what will be gained by upping the ante. A senior U.S. 
official who is coordinating a review of the problem has concluded only one 
thing: The United States is being badly outsmarted along the border -- and no 
one knows how. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, the geography that makes Mexico a vital partner in the United 
States' anti-drug effort has also made it the victim this century of two 
invasions from the north. That in turn has made Mexico's leaders protective of 
their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mexico's top anti-drug official, Javier Coello Trejo, insisted in an 
interview that current American estimates of cocaine passing through his 
country were at least four times too large. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffickers are not passing the quantity of drugs through here that (U.S. 
officials) say they are," he insisted. ". . . Not even 15% of the cocaine 
(consumed in the United States) passes through Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
So important is sovereignty that Mexican governments have routinely denied that 
the United States plays any part in Mexican anti-drug operations. But in a 
clear indication that a new U.S.-Mexican partnership has been forged despite 
the recent tensions, Coello declared, "Our relations are excellent." 
</P>
<P>
"There is an exchange of information," he said. "This has never happened 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its magnitude, the current drug troubles in the porous borderland stem 
from past successes. A U.S. buildup in south Florida in the mid-1980s managed 
to strike heavy blows against Colombian traffickers in what had been their 
favorite corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than fight, the traffickers switched air smuggling operations westward 
through Mexico, where cocaine traffic had been spare. When beefed-up radar 
defenses began to catch up with planes flying across the border, the 
traffickers turned to new ground routes. 
</P>
<P>
And when a valuable alliance with Mexican smugglers collapsed owing to the 
arrest of drug kingpin Felix Gallardo, the Colombians began to take over more 
of the operation themselves, with pilots delivering loads ever closer to the 
U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how cocaine is now smuggled into the United States from Mexico is a 
matter of dispute -- and a source of great anxiety for American officials. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe that much of it is now flown directly from Colombia into 
northern Mexico. With border radar that looks as deep as 150 miles into Mexico, 
the Americans track as many as 20 planes a day that set down near the border. 
Typically, at least three of those are believed to be traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
But at that point, knowledge becomes even more imperfect. Based on arrests, 
authorities believe that Mexican subcontractors still ferry loads into the 
United States. Based on seizures, it is known that the means of conveyance can 
range from a tractor-trailer to teams of mules -- both human and four-legged. 
</P>
<P>
But while there are many theories, no one knows for sure. And against a 
suspected rising tide of cocaine, the recent record of interdiction along the 
border gives little reason to believe that officials are on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
In all of 1989, customs inspectors working round the clock at border crossings 
from San Ysidro, Calif., to Brownsville, Tex., recovered just over nine tons of 
cocaine. In El Paso, deputy director Michael Nowak said his inspectors had made 
only one significant cocaine seizure in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in Los Angeles, agents in one lucky hit stumbled on more than twice that 
amount, more than 20 tons, in a San Fernando Valley warehouse. All of it and 
more, investigators believe, had been smuggled through the El Paso border 
crossing point. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on the rare occasions when cocaine is intercepted near the border, 
there is rarely as much as agents had expected. Statistics show that border 
guards are making just as many busts. It is simply that the average load is 
getting smaller. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the smugglers have wised up," said Charles S. Henry, a U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency official who is a tactical director of Operation Alliance, 
which coordinates anti-drug agencies along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Theories about smugglers' strategies vary from agency to agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem is right up the gut, at the crossings themselves," said David 
L. Westrate, assistant DEA administrator for operations. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Banks, a top customs official, points elsewhere: "We see evidence that it 
is coming across between the border points." 
</P>
<P>
According to government sources, a Bush Administration working group is so 
dissatisfied with those explanations that it has asked intelligence agencies to 
come up with a better picture. 
</P>
<P>
Among their tasks: to determine whether the interdiction effort is not so much 
being outsmarted as it is being sold out by corruption. Already, anti-drug 
officials say, there have been a number of ominous clues. 
</P>
<P>
In San Ysidro last month, border inspectors one day were unexpectedly ordered 
to switch to unaccustomed posts. Suddenly, a Mexican sitting in a car that was 
three cars away from the crossing point opened his door and ran. In his car was 
700 pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if the guy had been counting on favored treatment," one customs 
official said. The incident, and the inspector who would normally have searched 
the vehicle, remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not fair for us to talk so much about corruption on the Mexican side 
when we may have a very big problem ourselves," an Administration official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the military, the major new player on the American side of the 
border, has also been asked primarily to gather intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of National Guardsmen from California to Texas began to operate last year 
from remote border posts to survey smuggling traffic that might otherwise go 
undetected. The Air Force AWACS planes now devote 40% of their flight time to 
anti-drug surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
And since November, when the Defense Department established its Joint Task 
Force 6, such watch-and-wait operations along the border have become even more 
frequent. Now units of about 70 infantrymen armed with M-16 rifles periodically 
fan out in covert four-man teams along designated 30-mile segments. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the task force headquarters in an empty stockade on the 
outskirts of Ft. Bliss, Tex., Col. Thomas C. Carter, the deputy commander of 
the force, stressed that each team includes a Border Patrol agent and that 
soldiers do not take part in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're their eyes and ears," Carter said, noting that a support team of federal 
agents is responsible for arrests and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
But the creation of the unit has raised questions in some minds about the 
proper limits to a stepped-up U.S. response. With the task force said to be 
lobbying for more extensive operations and more independence -- all missions 
must now be approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- there is concern that too 
aggressive a posture might prove counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make sure the reins stay in place," one civilian official said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the concern dates from December, when Marines patrolling in southern 
Arizona fired over the heads of a pair of smugglers and sent up illumination 
flares that set ablaze several hundred acres of grassland in the Coronado 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the exchange, and after the smugglers fled, several 
hundred pounds of marijuana were recovered. But while the Marines reported that 
the smugglers had fired first, sources say that an ongoing Border Patrol 
inquiry has cast doubt on that account and may conclude that the Marines opened 
fired unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
A military official acknowledged in an interview that the incident "was a 
little outside of what we anticipated happening." But he said the Marines had 
found no reason to alter the rules of engagement governing such clandestine 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"If you burn the woods down," the official said, "gee, I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Given the importance of winning further Mexican cooperation, a far more 
important constraint on military operations is high-level wariness about the 
Mexican response. From the start, what was conceived in Washington as a 
military remedy was interpreted in Mexico City as a military affront. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, so harsh was the Mexican note of protest dispatched after the border 
task force was unveiled that sources say the State Department responded by 
encouraging the Pentagon to temporarily postpone any operations by the unit. 
</P>
<P>
And while tempers have since cooled, officials say that the potential benefits 
of new cooperation with Mexico will ensure that the task force proceeds with 
considerable caution. 
</P>
<P>
"Understandably, the Mexicans are nervous about this," one military official 
said. "We're going to go down on the border with guns. It's going to make the 
Mexicans nervous." 
</P>
<P>
That the collaboration in Monclova occurred at all is testament to a new 
back-channel relationship between the two nations that has helped to coordinate 
U.S.-Mexican anti-drug relations even as public tensions flared. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry over the task force was just the first in a series of squabbles. 
Last month, when the Bush Administration reported that the Mexican marijuana 
crop was 10 times larger than previously known, the Mexicans shot back that the 
finding was inaccurate and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Washington, there was fury over a Mexican decision to arrest 
Miguel Aldana Ibarra, under indictment in Los Angeles for the murder of DEA 
agent Enrique S. Camarena. U.S. officials believe that Aldana was locked up to 
keep him from talking to American investigators. 
</P>
<P>
However, behind the public tussles, according to informed sources, the 
government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari quietly took two major steps 
early this year that made the collaboration effort possible. 
</P>
<P>
It first granted permission for U.S. radar planes to fly over Mexican territory 
on anti-drug missions. At about the same time, it moved to establish in the 
northeastern city of Monterrey a "rapid response team" of federal police, 
giving Mexico a new capacity to interdict smugglers on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
In an indication that the accord remains highly sensitive, neither American nor 
Mexican officials would discuss the mission publicly. Westrate, the 
high-ranking DEA official, warned that details of the operation are 
"classified." Coello, Mexico's deputy attorney general, even denied that U.S. 
radar planes are now permitted to fly over Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But after The Times learned of the Monclova operation, a Customs Service 
spokeswoman, Kathy Hamer, confirmed that it had taken place. Still, she 
emphasized, "We don't routinely conduct surveillance through Mexican airspace." 
</P>
<P>
The overflight permission, based on a pact negotiated last May, makes it far 
easier for Texas-based Customs Service radar planes to reach airspace near the 
Pacific coast of Colombia. The corridor is believed to have been favored by 
smugglers because it was beyond the reach of Caribbean-based radar. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement requires the P-3 airborne early warning planes to shut down 
their radar while over Mexican airspace. But the 200-mile range of the radar 
nevertheless reaches well into Mexico, providing a more comprehensive look at 
suspected smugglers' corridors from either side of the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
And with the basis for the new rapid-response team in place, the new 
arrangements started paying off just after midnight Feb. 4, when the radar of 
one of the Customs Service planes detected the suspicious Turbo Commander over 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
With communications handled by a command, control and intelligence center at 
March Air Force Base in Riverside, Calif., the radar plane received Mexican 
government permission to pursue the suspected smuggler into Mexican airspace -- 
this time, with its radar still operating fully, according to the Customs 
Service account. 
</P>
<P>
Relaying word through the U.S. Embassy in Mexico and DEA agents in Monterrey, 
the Americans alerted the fledgling Mexican response team that the suspected 
smugglers were likely to reach the border soon after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
As the Turbo Commander moved off the Mexican coast to the Gulf of Mexico, the 
Americans could tell only that it was landing near Monclova, about 150 miles 
northwest of Monterrey. But the team of Mexican federal judicial police, 
accompanied by DEA agents, got lucky. 
</P>
<P>
There on the tarmac when they arrived at Monclova's main airport was the Turbo 
Commander. Inside were extra fuel tanks that had allowed the three Colombian 
pilots to fly nonstop from Colombia to the border. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine lay in neat piles outside -- and there was another bonus. Five of 
the seven Mexican guards turned out to be corrupt cops. Their ringleader was 
the head of the Monclova branch of the Mexican federal police. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the kind of thing we've been trying for 20 years to do," a customs 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, so successful was the U.S.-to-Mexico handoff that sources say it has 
been used as a model for at least two more busts linking American radar 
intelligence and the now well-established Monterrey team. 
</P>
<P>
Citing these successes, the DEA has proposed that the United States provide 
Mexico with about $65 million worth of helicopters and interceptor aircraft so 
that it can quickly establish more response teams all along the border. 
</P>
<P>
But for now at least, that plan has been derailed. Administration officials are 
unsure whether such a step would be wise. Mexico's Coello made clear in the 
interview that his country would rather take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
And as the glow of the success subsides, officials in both countries now 
express concern about whether joint anti-drug operations can survive the 
scrutiny of a deeply suspicious Mexican public. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of nervousness in Mexico about some of what we are doing," one 
U.S. official warned. "What worries us is that as soon as these things are 
disclosed, that could be the end."

FANS BID ADIEU TO THE LAST OF LIBERACE TRINKETS AND TREASURES 
</P>

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Szapko leaned forward in his seat, fixing his gaze on the auctioneer on 
the stage below. Bidding had started on Item No. 71, and Szapko, a chiropractor 
from Mission Viejo, aimed to win. 
</P>
<P>
The object of his ardor was a collection of decorative glassware, including a 
cake plate, biscuit jar and bowl etched with roses. The set -- accompanied by a 
glass boudoir lamp -- seemed rather ordinary. Except for one thing: 
</P>
<P>
It used to belong to Liberace. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't they lovely?" a triumphant Szapko said later, after competitors failed 
to top his bid of $250. "I think this was quite a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Szapko, a die-hard admirer of the late pianist who also shelled out $200 for a 
silver-painted candelabra, was one of 800 people who spent Sunday afternoon 
bidding on the final remnants of the Liberace legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of the flamboyant entertainer, collectors and even a few vacationing 
students in town for spring break packed the historic Plaza Theater to barter 
over 2,000 items with an estimated value in excess of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even Palm Springs Police Chief Don Burnett popped in. Burnett's wife, Dee, 
enjoys Liberace's music, and the couple took home a white wicker settee for 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed it," Dee Burnett said, "and it's also nice to have a piece of 
celebrity furniture." 
</P>
<P>
The goods sold Sunday represent the contents of Liberace's Palm Springs 
mansion, a sprawling Spanish-style estate near downtown dubbed "The Cloisters." 
Bidders were permitted to view the collection during tours of the home last 
week, while those who missed out made offers based on a videotape and catalogue 
of items supplied by the auction firm sponsoring the event, Butterfield &amp; 
Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Cloisters, a former hotel purchased by Liberace in 1967, was one of six 
homes owned by the pianist. While less extravagant than others, the Palm 
Springs residence was the entertainer's most beloved and the place he spent the 
days before his death from an AIDS-related illness in 1987, said Jamie James, 
Liberace's publicist for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberace Foundation for the Performing and Creative Arts, based in Las 
Vegas, had hoped to keep The Cloisters and operate it as a museum, something 
Liberace requested in his trust. But the Palm Springs City Council refused to 
grant a permit for the venture, concluding that the traffic generated by a 
tourist attraction was inappropriate for a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's board of directors thus agreed to sell the 7,000-square-foot 
home, and it was purchased earlier this year by a San Francisco developer for 
$750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The furniture, china, artwork and knickknacks sold Sunday were the last of 
Liberace's possessions. The bulk of his belongings were disposed of at a 1988 
auction at the Los Angeles Convention Center, and a small collection is on 
permanent display at the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas. Proceeds from both 
auctions went to the foundation, which awards music scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the end," publicist James said wistfully. "This is the last of it, and 
it's really quite sad." 
</P>
<P>
The Cloisters collection, James said, perhaps best reflected Liberace's lavish 
yet whimsical lifestyle. There were valuable antiques, like a Victorian carved 
oak dining room table and set of eight high-backed mahogany chairs -- purchased 
Sunday for $11,275. 
</P>
<P>
But there were also dozens of cheap trinkets -- like a giant candle in the 
shape of a white poodle -- that cluttered every conceivable nook of the Palm 
Springs home. The startling range of items, many of them gaudy and garish, 
seemed to validate the entertainer's reputation as the king of kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
"It horrified some people that he would place a priceless piece next to a 
plastic toy," James said. "But if it made him happy, the monetary value was 
meaningless. He just wanted his home to be a surprising, amusing place for his 
guests." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most intriguing items drawing bids Sunday were pieces Liberace used 
to create "theme suites" for visitors to his desert home. From the Rudolph 
Valentino Suite, for example, there was a brass, Empire-style sleigh bed 
decorated with swan heads and claw feet. Estimated value: $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Those on a tighter budget could have gone home with a pair of fish tanks used 
as a centerpiece in The Cloisters' drawing room. Those were a steal -- just $70 
for the two. 
</P>
<P>
True fans like Szapko had scads of goodies to choose from, like family 
portraits and Liberace's personalized travel case -- a surprisingly modest 
thing made of simulated alligator skin with the entertainer's name monogrammed 
in gilt. 
</P>
<P>
And for $182, one lucky bidder purchased some sure-fire conversation pieces -- 
two cases of paper napkins imprinted with the Liberace logo. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Alexander, 82, has been an ardent Liberace fan for four decades, since 
that first time she caught his show in her hometown of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the boys -- they were both taking piano at the time -- and he was such 
an inspiration," recalled a misty-eyed Alexander, who now lives in Sherman 
Oaks. "His music was so lovely." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Alexander got a backstage pass to watch the filming of a Liberace 
movie in Hollywood. As he was leaving the set, Liberace "came up and greeted 
me, and then kissed my hand. Well, you know," Alexander recalled, "that was 
quite a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Alexander spent $125 on some glassware -- "a small memento, 
something that will fit in my condo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Down the aisle, Colin Ticehurst and his wife, Lee, were bidding on six bar 
stools made of wrought iron with swiveling padded seats. The Ticehursts, 
retirees from Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, who are vacationing in Palm 
Springs, figured the stools would make a great souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
"These were a steal," Colin Ticehurst, a pianist himself and a fan of 
Liberace's talent and "flair," said of his $250 purchase. "They're going to 
Canada."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS LEGISLATIVE RACES; 
</P>
<P>
CALDERON IS FAVORED TO FILL OUT MONTOYA'S SENATE TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) paid a price for challenging 
Speaker Willie Brown's leadership two years ago -- Brown removed Calderon as 
majority whip, reduced the size of his staff, stripped him of his committee 
posts, and consigned him to a cramped office. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown apparently didn't interrupt Calderon's political advancement. 
</P>
<P>
In one of three special legislative elections in Southern California on 
Tuesday, Calderon is the heavy favorite to win a state Senate seat. As the only 
Democratic candidate on the ballot, he benefits from the 2 to 1 voter 
registration advantage his party enjoys in the 26th Senate District. And his 
Republican foe, businessman Joe Aguilar Urquidi of Montebello, said he has all 
but written off the special election in order to mount a stronger campaign this 
fall when the office is up for a full four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The special election is for the eight months remaining on the term of Joseph B. 
Montoya, who resigned from the Senate on Feb. 9, after being convicted on 
political corruption charges. The district takes in a blue-collar, heavily 
Latino section of the San Gabriel Valley that includes Alhambra, Baldwin Park, 
El Monte, La Puente, Monterey Park and Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome seems similarly assured in another of Tuesday's legislative races. 
In the 31st Senate District, which stretches from West Covina in Los Angeles 
County to Laguna Beach in Orange County, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) is 
expected to defeat Democrat Janice Graham to fill the two years left of the 
term of former state Sen. William Campbell, who resigned his seat late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a single winner may not emerge in Tuesday's primary for San Diego's 
78th Assembly District. The seat was vacated when Democrat Lucy Killea won 
election to the state Senate last December. The primary's nine-candidate field 
makes it unlikely that anyone will win more than 50% of the vote, meaning the 
top vote-getter from each party will face-off in a June special election. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, 40, won statewide attention in 1988 as a member of the "Gang of Five" 
-- a group of Assembly Democrats that launched an unprecedented attack on Brown 
and his ironclad control of the chamber. The Gang of Five billed themselves as 
advocates of legislative reform; critics charged that they were just grabbing 
for power. As part of the rebellion, Calderon came within a few votes of 
replacing Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon insists that he has repaired his relationship with Brown. An aide to 
Brown said the Speaker and Calderon "have a very good relationship. They have 
patched things up." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Calderon said, he never has regained staff or office space. His 
current committee assignments, he noted, carry no clout or prestige. And, as a 
one-time rival for the speakership, he is sure his presence in the Assembly 
brings Brown "no peace of mind." In fact, he said, Brown jokingly offered to be 
his campaign manager if that would get him out of the Assembly and into the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The gains from his political challenge to Brown, Calderon said, are that he 
acquired a reputation for independence and learned that he can be effective in 
the Legislature without holding a powerful position. 
</P>
<P>
Even without major opposition, Calderon is sending out mailers, posting signs 
and running phone banks in a full-scale campaign that he estimates will cost 
nearly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney, Calderon grew up in Montebello, where he began his political 
career by winning election to the school board. Considered a moderate Democrat, 
he won the first of his four terms in the Assembly in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidi, 63, Calderon's Republican foe, said professional political workers 
have told him he cannot win the special election because he is not well-known, 
but that if he keeps campaigning, he will have a better chance in November. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidi said he is counting on his military service in World War II and Korea, 
his membership in veterans' organizations, his anti-abortion views, and his 
skeptical attitude toward government, to attract votes. 
</P>
<P>
The third candidate on the ballot, Kim Goldsworthy, 33, of Rosemead, said he 
expects to attract the customary 1% or 2% of the vote that Libertarians usually 
get. He said he is running to espouse the Libertarian view that "taxation is 
legalized theft." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Urquidi nor Goldsworthy offered any criticism of Calderon. "I can't say 
anything about Calderon," said Goldsworthy. "He comes across as a people person 
. . . a very nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
Richard S. Gonzales, a 38-year-old Democrat from Baldwin Park, has filed as a 
write-in candidate after failing to submit enough signatures to qualify for the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the heavily Democratic makeup of the 26th Senate District is a major 
factor in Calderon's favor, Republican Hill is the expected beneficiary of the 
political composition of the 31st Senate District, where registered Republicans 
outnumber Democrats 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Graham, of Laguna Hills, pinned her hopes of overcoming the 
registration figures on two issues -- ethics and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, 53, has consistently noted that Hill's Sacramento office was raided by 
the FBI in August, 1988, as part of the agency's investigation of legislative 
influence peddling that led to Montoya's conviction. Hill, however, has not 
been charged and the ethics issue has not caught fire in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Graham also has stressed her support for abortion rights, contrasting that with 
Hill's opposition to most abortions. However, California abortion rights groups 
declined to funnel time or money into Graham's race because they consider it 
unwinnable. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Hill, first elected to the Assembly in 1982, has predicted he 
will spend about $1.2 million on his Senate campaign. Graham has reported 
raising only about $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary for San Diego's 78th Assembly District, election overkill and 
the lack of divisive issues have conspired to produce a low-profile, rather 
somnolent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's contest is the third special legislative race in San Diego County in 
the last six months, and some candidates and consultants predict that "voter 
fatigue" will result in an especially low turnout. And while the two special 
races late last year drew national attention as referendums on the volatile 
abortion issue, no such issue has surfaced in the current race to heighten 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Nine names -- five Democrats, three Republicans and a Peace and Freedom Party 
member -- are on the ballot, though three of the candidates have ceased 
campaigning. Former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch, a Democrat, is the 
best-known candidate and the only one viewed as having a chance to garner more 
than the 50% of the vote needed to win the Assembly seat outright. The only 
active GOP candidate is Jeff Marston, a former aide to ex-U.S. Sen. S.I. 
Hayakawa (R-Calif.).

SOUTH, EAST SHIVER -- BUT ALASKA WARMS UP

<P>
A cold air mass drove temperatures to record lows Sunday in 11 Southern and 
Eastern states, while parts of normally frigid Alaska welcomed a virtual heat 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
The thermometer hit 54 at Yakutat, beginning what the National Weather Service 
predicted would be several days of record-breaking high temperatures in 
southern Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Record lows were recorded from Pennsylvania south to Apalachicola, Fla., where 
the mercury dipped to 43. Elkins, W. Va., experienced a record low of 16 
degrees, Sunday's frostiest temperature in the Lower 48 states. 
</P>

Low temperature marks were also set in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia and Mississippi. The weather service 
blamed the unseasonable chill on a large dome of cold air centered over 
Kentucky.

AMERICAN ALBUM: WAITING FOR BOZO: IN CHICAGO, THEY TAKE A CLOWN SERIOUSLY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Andrea Stava, pretty in pink from hair bow to party shoes, leaned against her 
mommy's knees as she waited in the crowd. She seemed awfully calm considering 
she had waited all her life for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the 6-year-old was too young to grasp the full import of the occasion. It 
wasn't lost on her mother. "I waited 28 years!" Debbie Stava exclaimed. "When 
we got the tickets I went bonkers for Bozo!" 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Bozo is as quintessentially Chicago as deep dish pizza or the Cubs' 
Bleacher Bums. Tickets for "The Bozo Show," the longest running children's 
program on television, are so much in demand that parents order them before 
their children are born. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Vanau ordered eight tickets while pregnant with her first child. Nine 
years and five kids later, she finally got the word that her time had come. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Watson and her husband received four Bozo tickets from a neighbor when 
they were married. "It was a great wedding present," Watson recalls. "I 
remember thinking: 'Gee, what will we be doing in 10 yea" 
</P>
<P>
The reservation list for the show became so unmanageable that it was frozen 10 
years ago at 200,000 names. WGN-TV, the Chicago based superstation that 
produces Bozo five days a week, 155 shows a year, recently got down to the 
final few names. It briefly opened a special telephone number a few weeks ago 
to take ticket requests for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Bell logged about 27 million attempts in Illinois alone. And since the 
program is also carried on cable systems throughout the United States and parts 
of Central and South America, ticket requests poured in from thousands of miles 
away as well. 
</P>
<P>
The 140,000 tickets were snatched up in 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Ursin, a Los Angeles resident who grew up in Chicago, ordered four 
tickets even though she has no children. "My sister has a newborn and wanted 
them so badly that I made an extra effort to call," she says. Ursin plans to 
come to Chicago for "The Bozo Show" and will bring "my sister, her child and 
maybe if I have one in five years. . . . I don't anticipate seeing the tickets 
for several years." 
</P>
<P>
Bozo has been around for more than half a century and has even entered the 
lexicon as a slang term for a "fool." The character was created for children's 
records, but made its way onto the television screen when Larry Harmon, the Los 
Angeles actor who was the voice of Bozo, bought the rights to the clown in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
He franchised the character to more than 80 local stations across the country, 
including one in Washington, D.C., where Willard Scott, now the weatherman on 
"The Today Show," played the clown. Today, only a few locally produced Bozo 
shows remain, but none come close to the success of the Chicago version. 
</P>
<P>
"This, by local standards, is a large production," said producer Allen Hall, 
who has been with the show since it premiered here in 1961. "Most stations 
can't afford to do this kind of thing." The show's prop cage has floors of 
costumes, laugh-getters like a real 15-gallon hat and shelves chock full of 
rubber chickens, turkeys, salamis and a host of other unedible edibles. 
</P>
<P>
Cavorting with Bozo under the yellow, red and blue studio big top is Cooky, a 
round, naive clown who is often the target of the season's 15 to 20 cases worth 
of shaving cream pies and Wizzo, a magician decked out in Arabian garb. And 
there is Professor Andy, the show's spike-haired musician, a preteen heartthrob 
who regularly gets perfumed love letters from young fans. 
</P>
<P>
Lessons in morality lose out to pratfalls and banana peels. Nevertheless, Hall 
likens Bozo to Mr. Rogers, the popular children's TV host, in that both 
communicate with kids. "They're like members of the family. The kids feel like 
they're watching friends." 
</P>
<P>
Festooned in his thick stage makeup and bright orange wig, Bozo (actor Joey 
D'Auria) agreed. "You get little kids, little tiny ones, and they say 'I love 
you Bozo,' " the 38-year-old one-time stand-up comic said before a recent 
taping. "That makes you melt." 
</P>
<P>
Before Bozo, D'Auria performed in Los Angeles comedy clubs. As Dr. Flameo, he 
screamed in key as he placed his hand over various sized candles. His act won 
on "The Gong Show" and gained the attention of Johnny Carson's bookers. D'Auria 
sent a copy of his appearance on the talk show to WGN-TV when Bob Bell, the 
original Chicago Bozo, retired in 1984. The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the best job in the whole world," Bozo/D'Auria squealed. "I get to make 
people happy and I love doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Although each program is taped a week in advance of its air date, editing is 
considered taboo. Even the plea from a boy who once whispered: "I gotta go to 
the bathroom" into Bozo's hidden microphone was aired. 
</P>
<P>
Skits are spiced with sight gags: One clown hitting the other with a 6-foot 
sponge mallet. And there are the old jokes: Bozo's brother is getting married 
to a two-headed lady. Asks Cooky: "Is she pretty?" Answers Bozo: "Well, yes and 
no." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's favorite feature is the Grand Prize Game when a boy and a girl are 
randomly selected to toss Ping-Pong balls into six buckets, each a bit farther 
away than the last. Parents fondly recall practicing at home when they were 
only knee high. Children anxiously await a chance to win a bicycle and $100. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Stava was lucky enough to win the chance to play the Grand Prize Game. 
Her arm wasn't strong enough to get past the third bucket but she still took 
home a bounty of gifts, and got a big hug from Bozo. What did she like best? 
"Everything," she said. "I like everything!"

TOLL RISES IN NORTH SEA FERRY FIRE; 
</P>

DISASTER: UP TO 147 ARE REPORTED DEAD. AS WORKERS BEGIN REMOVING BODIES, POLICE 
LAUNCH AN ARSON INVESTIGATION.

<P>
Exhausted firefighters Sunday braved intense heat and poisonous smoke from a 
burning North Sea ferry to begin removing the bodies of up to 147 victims while 
Norwegian police began the hunt for a suspected arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
The fire aboard the Danish-owned Scandinavian Star ferry was so intense that it 
melted aluminum on the ship's bridge, according to rescue workers. By late 
Sunday night, the blaze was reported extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fire broke out today on a car ferry carrying 297 people from 
Britain's west coast to Ireland, killing a crew member and injuring at least 
nine other people, a Royal Air Force spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Oslo said the hunt for a suspected arsonist in the fire on the 
Scandinavian Star is under way. 
</P>
<P>
"We are basing our work on the concrete theory that it was arson," Oslo's 
assistant chief of police, Magnar Aukrust, told a news conference in the 
Norwegian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Aukrust noted a possible link between the Scandinavian Star disaster and 
several recent fires on Danish North Sea ferries, at least one of which was 
blamed on arson. It was not immediately clear if arson was the cause of the 
today's fire on the British car ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Lysekil, where the Scandinavian Star is docked, said 75 passengers 
were confirmed dead. The search continued for up to 72 missing people believed 
to still be on board the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began before dawn Saturday while the ship was in the North Sea 
carrying about 500 tourists and crew members overnight from Norway to Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters in masks and breathing equipment fought through one corridor 
"until their gear started to burn," said fire official Olle Wennstrom. One 
firefighter was slightly hurt Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, a few hours after the ship was towed into port, the fire 
spread from the gutted middle section to the captain's bridge. The blaze sent 
plumes of smoke over Lysekil, about 250 miles southwest of Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
Tugboats doused the ship with water. Holes were blasted into the side of the 
10,500-ton vessel to allow water to drain out, for fear that the badly listing 
ferry would topple onto the concrete dock. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with VR-DANO Line, the company in Copenhagen that owns and operates 
the Bahamian-flagged ship, said the blaze was caused by an arsonist, citing two 
fires that broke out at a short interval on different decks. 
</P>
<P>
District Police Chief Roar Onso, revising earlier figures, said 345 people 
survived the fire, which broke out about midway on the ship's 10-hour voyage 
from Oslo to Denmark's northern port of Frederikshavn. Ferry captain Hugo 
Larsen told police of 395 passengers and 97 crew members. If his figure is 
correct, 147 people died, Onso said. 
</P>
<P>
An American survivor said in a telephone interview Sunday that an apparently 
faulty alarm never sounded until at least 15 minutes after the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Qualls, of Hot Springs, Ark., said he never saw a fire crew with hoses and 
that the motor on his lifeboat didn't work. He also said he had never practiced 
an emergency drill on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew did everything they possibly could. The crew saved as many lives as 
they could," he said. "They were understaffed. Never once did we see a fire 
team, people with hoses. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The alarm didn't sound until the ship was filled up with smoke and flames. 
Because of that, the people who were sleeping are the ones who perished," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Qualls was part of a seven-member song-and-dance troupe from New York hired to 
entertain passengers. All but one other member of the troupe, Ruth E. Rome, of 
East Lansing, Mich., were listed as rescued. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Onso said that officials will wait until today to finish 
conducting a search of the ferry, which was cited for safety and fire 
violations after a 1988 blaze. A commission of inquiry is to be set up to work 
parallel to a police inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Onso confirmed reports that two fires broke out aboard the ferry. 
</P>
<P>
One blaze started in a pile of sheets outside a cabin on the car deck but was 
smothered by passengers, he said. A second fire started minutes later in a 
cabin one deck above the car deck, and it was apparently this blaze that turned 
the ship into a floating deathtrap.

JUDGE INSTRUCTS POLICE TO LEAVE EXHIBIT ALONE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: CROWDS LINE UP FOR THE SECOND DAY OF A SHOWING OF PHOTOS BY THE LATE 
ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE. THE MUSEUM HAS BEEN INDICTED FOR OBSCENITY.

<P>
A federal judge granted an injunction Sunday barring law officers from 
interfering with an exhibit of photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. The 
display had brought about an obscenity indictment against a downtown museum and 
its director. 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporary Arts Center sought the injunction because its officials feared 
police or sheriff's department officers might remove sexually explicit 
photographs that a Hamilton County grand jury determined Saturday violated Ohio 
obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
After the injunction was granted by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin at an 
unusual Sunday morning hearing, the exhibition opened to a large throng for a 
second day. The atmosphere was decidedly more relaxed than it had been on 
Saturday when police shut down the exhibit temporarily in mid-afternoon and 
when the arts center and its director were indicted on obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The air doesn't have as much tension in it," said Robert Allen of Lightborne 
Communications, the show's corporate sponsor, as he watched the long line of 
people that stretched out of the lobby, snaked through the building's atrium 
and continued outside around the block. 
</P>
<P>
The show has broken attendance records since its private opening Friday night, 
when an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people paid $10 each and stood in line in 
40-degree temperatures for hours to view the exhibit. Arts center spokeswoman 
Amy Bannister said the usually free openings normally draw from 600 to 1,100 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands more saw the show over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Many came because of the controversy, some because they feared that police 
would shut the show down for allegedly violating community standards of 
decency. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to people yesterday and a lot of them were here for two reasons," 
Allen said. "Some came because they wanted to see something happen and a lot of 
them were here to see the exhibit before, quote, it was closed down." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension Saturday had been plainclothes police detectives and 
members of the grand jury mingling with the opening day crowd. After inspecting 
the photographs, the grand jury returned to the courthouse to indict the arts 
center and its director, Dennis Barrie, on misdemeanor charges of pandering 
obscenity and illegally using a minor in nudity oriented material. 
</P>
<P>
Then the police closed the exhibit for about 90 minutes while they videotaped 
and photographed the 175 works on display for use as evidence in criminal 
proceedings. Hundreds of arts patrons and protesters chanted and jeered outside 
in the atrium while this went on. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Judge Rubin ordered the art center to supply the prosecution with 
copies of all photographs on display. Several of the photographs depict 
children with their genitals exposed. Others show men performing 
sadomasochistic acts. 
</P>
<P>
Explicit photographs depicting sadomasochistic sex are being shown in a 
separate gallery and no one under age 18 is being admitted to the exhibit 
without a guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Those steps weren't sufficient for county Prosecutor Arthur Ney, who had urged 
the center to voluntarily take down seven works that the grand jury deemed 
obscene and suggested that further law enforcement action might be forthcoming 
if the center did not remove them. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction prevents that and the exhibit is scheduled to run through May 26 
before moving to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to the injunction remaining in force pending trial of the 
issue. Barrie, who is to be arraigned Friday, faces a maximum sentence of one 
year in jail and a fine of $2,000. The arts center faces a maximum fine of 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs, which have been exhibited without incident in Chicago, 
Philadelphia, Berkeley and Hartford, Conn., sparked controversy in Washington 
last year when Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) attacked some of the photographs as 
obscene. The uproar caused the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington to cancel 
a planned showing.

EXXON ARRAIGNMENT SET TODAY ON OIL SPILL CRIMINAL CHARGES

<P>
Exxon through its lawyers is due to appear in federal court this afternoon for 
arraignment on criminal charges in connection with last year's disastrous Exxon 
Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to defend ourselves vigorously," Exxon Shipping Co. attorney James 
Neal said from his Nashville law office before flying to Anchorage for the U.S. 
District Court arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Corp., which is being represented by O'Melveny &amp; Myers of Los 
Angeles, and Exxon Shipping Co. were expected to plead innocent to five charges 
against each firm contained in a Feb. 27 federal grand jury indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Convictions could bring fines of more than $700 million, based on damage 
estimates of the 11-million-gallon spill of March 24, 1989, according to the 
Department of Justice. In addition, Exxon could be ordered to pay restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon had sought to avoid criminal charges in secret negotiations with the 
Justice Department. But the talks fell apart when Alaska officials publicly 
decried the process and criticized the Bush Administration's handling of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the two Exxon companies were indicted for five environmental 
crimes -- violating the Clean Water Act, the Refuse Act, the Migratory Bird 
Act, the Ports and Waterways Safety Act and the Dangerous Cargo Act. 
</P>
<P>
In the indictment, the Justice Department said Exxon was responsible for its 
skipper's actions -- for taking the tanker out of shipping lanes and then 
leaving the bridge to an "unqualified" mate and an "incompetent" helmsman. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker broke open on Bligh Reef, spewing oil into Prince William Sound and 
the Gulf of Alaska and affecting wildlife and fishing. Crude oil hit 1,200 
miles of shoreline, including seven national parks and wildlife refuges. The 
spill was the worst in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping's attorney, Neal, 60, was a U.S. attorney in Tennessee in the 
1960s and prosecuted Teamster leader James R. Hoffa. A decade later he served 
as chief trial counsel for the Watergate special prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
As a private defense lawyer, Neal won acquittals for Elvis Presley's doctor on 
drug-related charges, the Ford Motor Co. in the Pinto crash case, Louisiana 
Gov. Edwin W. Edwards on corruption charges and John Landis on charges arising 
out of the Twilight Zone movie crash deaths.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: AMERICA'S UNFUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Day after day, he watched amateur videos. 
</P>
<P>
He saw a small child left alone in a moving truck. He saw a bunny chewed by a 
dog, a cat dropped from the top of a barn, a horse smashed in the head with a 
crutch. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially I laughed, not thinking about it," Smitty said about being an 
$8-an-hour screener for "America's Funniest Home Videos," the ABC series whose 
popularity is soaring along with sales of lightweight camcorders that allow 
ordinary people to transfer every aspect of their lives to videotape. "But I 
began to watch these, visualizing the cameraperson. I imagined them standing 
there, with their video camera." 
</P>
<P>
Smitty is not his real name. Worried about future employment, he requested 
anonymity before describing in detail some of the videos sent in to the 
Sunday-night program by people seeking to win a $10,000 weekly prize, which 
would then qualify them for the $100,000 payoff coming at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's videos cover many topics, children head the list. 
</P>
<P>
The revolting videos described here were rejected by screeners, having been 
rated not funny enough to pass along to segment producers for further 
evaluation in the step-by-step selection process whereby very few submissions 
ever get on the air. 
</P>
<P>
That they even got made and were considered humorous, however, is a deeply 
disturbing commentary on the mentality of some Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Child in truck: A woman puts a girl of about 2 in the driver's seat of a pickup 
whose motor is running. Then, after someone has apparently slipped the truck 
into drive, it moves forward 10 to 15 miles per hour with the girl still in the 
driver's seat, traveling about 15 yards before hitting a camper shell and 
pushing it into a small car. 
</P>
<P>
The crying child is removed from the truck by the woman, who appears to be 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Child on slide: Dressed in a frilly white party dress, a girl of about 2 climbs 
by herself to the top of a 10-foot slide, then goes down it and lands in a mud 
puddle at the base of the slide, hitting her head on the ground and crying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious she was supposed to land in the puddle because she had nowhere 
else to land, and there was no one there to catch her," says Smitty. Not only 
that, she could have fallen from the top of the slide and been seriously hurt. 
"The producers don't want anything that's really violent," Smitty says. "But 
the people sending these in don't seem to be able to differentiate what's funny 
from what's unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
Child and inner tube: A man is sitting on the ground with his hand on an 
inflated rubber inner tube as a toddler playfully cavorts in front of him, 
seemingly wanting to be hit with the inner tube. As the little boy takes a step 
forward, the man swings the inner tube, hitting the boy in the head so hard 
that he's knocked off his feet and hits the ground head first. In the 
background there's laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy may have wanted to be hit, but not hit like that," says Smitty. 
</P>
<P>
Infant in stroller: An infant is being pushed in a stroller. There's an edit in 
the video, after which the child is still very clearly in the stroller, which 
is now rolling on its own quite fast down an incline toward a cross street. As 
it reaches the street, there is another edit, after which the stroller is seen 
rolling across the street and disappearing into a ravine. After another edit, 
smoke and fire pour from the spot where the stroller disappeared, as the infant 
crawls from the ravine. 
</P>
<P>
The video was obviously staged, Smitty says. A doll may have been substituted 
for the child in the portion where the stroller rolls across the street into 
the ravine, he says. "It's not that violent. I just think it's sick." 
</P>
<P>
Child on father: A man is on the floor, leaning forward on his elbows and knees 
while pretending to watch TV. After mounting a chair behind him, a toddler girl 
jumps on his back, but as she does he collapses his arms, sending her face 
forward into the floor and making her cry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people making videos for us that are violent," Smitty says. "But how 
many did they screw up, when the kid actually did fall into the entertainment 
center? These people aren't stupid, though. I don't think anybody is going to 
send a video of a kid with a broken face and arm." 
</P>
<P>
Baby sleeping: A boy, about a year old, is sleeping while sitting on the floor 
with his back to a couch. The video goes on a number of minutes as the 
whimpering, sleeping, obviously exhausted child repeatedly teeters and appears 
on the verge of falling over, only to catch himself. Finally he does fall over, 
crying as he hits his head on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We get lots of tapes of kids falling asleep in high chairs and rocking chairs 
and parents not putting them down," Smitty says. "And we see a lot of vomit. 
I've even seen a baby vomiting into a dad's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
More and more of the entries are being staged, he said. He described one sent 
in response to the show's call for videos of children getting their first 
haircuts. "It took place where a poodle was getting trimmed. So they bring in 
this little boy in a wire dog-kennel cage, and he looks dazed. Then they put 
him up there where they have the dogs and cut his hair. Why would you want to 
freak out a kid like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Or harm animals? 
</P>
<P>
Smitty described some rejected videos that show that it's not only kids who are 
endangered by some of these amateur filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Bunny and puppy: The scene is a front lawn, where a girl of about 6 is handed a 
bunny, which can't be more than a few weeks old. "I gotta baby bunny," the girl 
says. Someone tells the girl to place the bunny on the grass. She does, and 
after the bunny runs into some bushes, a man frees a fairly good-sized black 
Labrador puppy from its leash and leads it to where the bunny is hiding, 
apparently thinking they'll play together. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, there is screaming. Next, the camera shows the dog with the writhing 
bunny in its mouth, gripping it so hard that it can't be removed. Finally, the 
bunny is pried loose. "Did he kill it?" someone asks. "Yes," the man replies, 
running off with the bunny in an attempt to spare the child, who has been 
crying throughout and sounds traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
Next scene shows the entire family inside, where the man tells the little girl 
that when he put the bunny down to "get a hammer," the bunny ran away. 
</P>
<P>
Cat in barn: A farm boy and cat are sitting on the rafters of what appears to 
be a tall barn. Suddenly the boy tries to push the cat off. The cat tries to 
hold on with its claws, but ultimately falls. "You don't see the cat hit the 
ground," Smitty says. "But you know they're high up because if they were just 
three or four feet off the ground, the cat would just jump for safety instead 
of trying to hold on." 
</P>
<P>
Racehorse on track: A trotter is loose on a track, still attached to its sulky. 
As it passes a man standing at the rail, he attempts to stop it by smashing it 
in the head with the heavy end of a wooden crutch. Then the video is edited so 
that the man appears to be hitting the horse again and again and again, as 
light music plays in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Child and kitties: A toddler innocently picks up a very small kitten by its 
tail and tries to spin it, then puts it down and steps on it. Then he picks up 
another small kitten and throws it down so that it lands on its back in a 
puddle. Then he kicks the kitten. 
</P>
<P>
Cat in bucket: A man puts a cat into a bucket. Then he swings the bucket around 
by its handle in a very fast windmill motion, with the cat still inside, 
screeching. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smitty believes that "America's Funniest Home Videos" has "tapped a 
resource that has an end," that end doesn't appear in sight given the huge 
profits of the ABC program and the low cost of producing video-oriented series. 
Among others said to be proposed or set for fall is the syndicated "$1,000,000 
Video Challenge." And one of its four categories is "Kids." 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers crashing, falling or being tossed in the air and then accidentally 
dropped on the ground, as happened in another recent submission to "America's 
Funniest Home Videos" described by Smitty? 
</P>
<P>
You wonder about a society where some people equate humor with abusing animals 
and using kids as stunt persons.

FARM AID: DOWN-TO-EARTH MARATHON; 
</P>
<P>
BENEFIT: FOURTEEN-HOUR CONCERT IN INDIANAPOLIS BREAKS $1-MILLION RECORD IN 
PLEDGES WHILE FOCUSING ATTENTION ON ECONOMIC WOES IN AGRICULTURE.

<P>
Farm Aid IV wasn't supposed to happen. Farm Aids I, II and III were intended to 
help beleaguered American farmers and educate the public about the economic 
crisis so that another benefit mega-concert wouldn't be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But here were 70 or so country, rock and pop performers gathered at the Hoosier 
Dome on Saturday, a sell-out crowd of 45,000 and a cable television audience, 
all focusing once again on farm issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about it," said Farm Aid co-founder John Mellencamp, a native of 
down-the-road Bloomington and the ad hoc concert host backstage before his 
performance near the end of the 14-hour marathon. "When we started this in '85 
it seemed like a big deal, like we could take care of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But, referring to the 1985 Ethiopian famine-relief Live Aid concert, Mellencamp 
acknowledged that such events can only accomplish so much. 
</P>
<P>
"People are still starving in Africa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And family farmers are still losing their land. So Mellencamp, Farm Aid 
co-founders Willie Nelson and Neil Young and the Farm Aid funding and lobbying 
organization hoped to make the best of the need for another show. And that's 
just what they did. 
</P>
<P>
Farm Aid IV was a triumph all down the line, from its variety of electrifying 
musical moments -- including a moving tribute by surprise guest Elton John to 
young AIDS victim Ryan White, who died hours later at a nearby hospital, and a 
crowd-energizing appearance by Guns N' Roses -- to its fund-raising: At the 
show's mid-point, Farm Aid executive director Carolyn Mugar announced that the 
mark of $1 million in pledges was about to be broken, surpassing the individual 
totals of Farm Aids II and III. 
</P>
<P>
The concert also served as a catalyst for some savvy political 
coalition-building. 
</P>
<P>
"Uniting the snuff-dippers on the farm with the bean-sprout-eaters in the 
city," was the theme repeatedly stated by Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim 
Hightower throughout the long day. That was reflected most in the new alliance 
of Farm Aid with the environmental Earth Day organization. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of Jesse Jackson, a longtime supporter of Farm Aid, emphasized 
ethnic minority and urban interests in farm issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sounding like a candidate in search of a campaign, Jackson said at a backstage 
press conference: "An urban initiative and rural renaissance go hand in hand." 
</P>
<P>
A Jackson address to the crowd impressed at least one farmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'd make a great secretary of Agriculture," said Dick Martin, from 
nearby Groveland. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the most part, everybody's thoughts were down on the farm Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather was a farmer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"My father had a farm. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up on a farm. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere you went inside the Hoosier Dome, a concrete structure with a fabric 
roof, you could hear a farm anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers discussed their troubles without prompting. Backstage, Ben Cohen of Ben 
&amp; Jerry's Ice Cream and Ralph Page of the minority-farmer Federation of 
Southern Cooperatives worked a tentative deal for peaches. 
</P>
<P>
And it seemed that each of the 70 or so performers, from Willie Nelson to Guns 
N' Roses' Axl Rose, had stories about days on the farm. Even the very urban Lou 
Reed, after stating in a backstage interview that, no, he didn't have a farm 
anecdote, admitted that part of his reason for returning to the Farm Aid stage 
(he was in the lineup for Farm Aid I in 1985) was that he now lives surrounded 
by farmland outside New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"Down on the Farm" was the title of a song performed by Guns N' Roses, 
farm-boys-gone-Hollywood whose two-song appearance galvanized the crowd about 
two-thirds into the concert. The number, originally done by English punk band 
U.K. Subs, was far from the anthem-of-the-land kind of piece that other 
performers had done earlier. Sample lines: "I feel just like a vegetable / Down 
here on the farm." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana-born Rose explained before the song that "it's the only farm song we 
know" and begged the crowd to take is as a good-natured joke. 
</P>
<P>
What did the farmers think? 
</P>
<P>
Dick Martin, who raises cattle, hogs, soy and corn on 950 acres, gave it an 
exaggerated thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
"It caused a stampede of my livestock," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
But younger Kitty Poehler, sitting with Martin and his wife Debbie, expressed 
the opinion that more represented the audience as a whole: "They rule!" 
</P>
<P>
While all-star benefits have become old hat in Los Angeles, Farm Aid IV was 
anything but in Indianapolis, where the show seemed to be on everyone's minds, 
along with the Ryan White story. Tremendous appreciation was shown for 
virtually all the performers. Even Iggy Pop, whose hard-hitting appearance at 
first put stunned expressions on many faces, received a loud ovation after his 
two songs. 
</P>
<P>
Particular favorites included hometowners Mellencamp, John Hiatt and Henry Lee 
Summer, a duet of Bruce Hornsby and Don Henley on "The End of the Innocence," 
Grammy queen Bonnie Raitt teaming with Hiatt, and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; 
Young repeating the reunion they made at two Santa Monica benefits last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 70 acts were perhaps 20 too many (the concluding gang-sing of "This Land Is 
Your Land" came just before 1 a.m., nearly two hours later than scheduled), and 
some in the audience clearly could have done with less country, or less rock, 
or something. But with an average of about six minutes per act and relatively 
quick set changes, the show progressed fast enough to keep most from growing 
impatient. The only hole was the absence of truly urban artists. (Rapper LL 
Cool J had been scheduled, but was unable to make the show.) 
</P>
<P>
There was one disappointed young couple, though. Matt Waters, 17, and Terri 
Hacker, 16, high school students from nearby Pittsboro, had bought their $30 
tickets under the mistaken impression that country star Randy Travis would 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the event was inspiring to the teens, both of whom live on farms. 
They took pride in the performers' show of support for farmers, leading to 
comments that would make great ad copy for the Future Farmers of America. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to farm when I'm out of school," said an enthusiastic Waters. "I'm sure 
going to try." 
</P>
<P>
Added Hacker, "Most kids I know feel like that. I wouldn't leave farm country 
if my life depended on it."

PLAN TO LINK AMPHITHEATERS SPARKS INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS STUDYING WHETHER A PROPOSED ASSOCIATION 
OF IRVINE MEADOWS AND PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE WOULD CHOKE COMPETITION. THE 
DEPARTMENT ALSO IS SEEKING PROMOTERS' BUSINESS RECORDS WITH 29 SOUTHLAND 
VENUES.

<P>
A proposed alliance between Orange County's two giant concert amphitheaters has 
prompted an investigation into the possible "elimination of competition" and a 
wide-ranging inquiry into the Southland's concert industry by the U.S. Justice 
Department's antitrust division, industry officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained by The Times indicate that the government is studying a 
proposed association between the operators of the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa 
Mesa and Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre that could be in violation of four 
provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Spratling, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division in San 
Francisco, confirmed the inquiry but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice Department documents indicate that the antitrust division is 
seeking detailed business records from Orange County and Los Angeles-area 
promoters who might have arranged events at 29 venues in Southern California, 
virtually all the local concert facilities -- including the Shrine, the 
Pantages, UCLA's Royce Hall, Greek Theatre, Hollywood Bowl, Coliseum, Sports 
Arena and a number of other concert sites -- as well as Irvine Meadows and the 
Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, investigators are interested in dates of concerts, names of 
performers and facilities where concerts were held, ticket sale revenue, memos, 
phone records, ledgers, contracts and numbers of tickets sold for events since 
Jan. 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The information was to be provided by last Friday for the investigation that 
was triggered following an overture last month from the Nederlander 
Organization, which built and operates the Pacific, to a group of private 
investors that owns Irvine Meadows. One promoter said he was asking for an 
extension because of the exhaustive list of documents requested. 
</P>
<P>
The documents further indicate that the government is looking into, among other 
things, possible restraint of trade, monopolization -- if one company 
controlled both venues -- and attempts to acquire stock or ownership of a 
company for the purpose of lessening competition. 
</P>
<P>
But if approved, the alliance between the 18,765-capacity Pacific and the 
15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre could end years of bitter rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Pacific opened in 1983, two years after Irvine Meadows, the 
facilities have waged high-stakes bidding wars to book the hottest rock, pop, 
country and jazz attractions. Each amphitheater has offered about 35 to 55 
concerts annually. 
</P>
<P>
This competition has meant more money for entertainers but also higher ticket 
prices. Pacific Amphitheatre officials said joint operation of the 
amphitheaters would open the door to other promoters, stimulate competition and 
benefit ticket buyers. At the same time, entertainers would no longer benefit 
from the bidding war for their services. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials at the Nederlander Organization approached owners of Irvine 
Meadows with an offer to form "an association," Nederlander attorney Neil 
Papiano said Friday. Negotiations between the two parties are still under way 
as the Justice Department inquiry continues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Papiano, who also is a partner in Nederlander, said that an association with 
Irvine Meadows would increase, not eliminate, competition by breaking the 
exclusive booking arrangement that Irvine struck in 1983 with Avalon 
Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander is a New York firm that books and promotes concerts nationwide. 
Avalon is Southern California's largest independent concert promoter and has 
been a fierce rival with Nederlander in Orange County and Los Angeles for 
touring concert attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Concert industry sources familiar with the deal said that Nederlander and Ogden 
Allied Leisure Services, a major concessionaire, together have bid to buy a 
majority interest in Irvine Meadows from its owners. Nederlander and Ogden are 
also partners in a proposal to build an indoor sports and concert arena in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Papiano declined to provide more details about the nature of the association, 
saying "negotiations are ongoing and several possibilities have been 
discussed." 
</P>
<P>
If Nederlander is successful in breaking Avalon's exclusive booking agreement, 
Papiano said, "a lot of people will benefit from this -- not just us -- 
(because), if it is consummated, anybody can book shows there. . . . This would 
be a substantial benefit to concert-goers, and to all the promoters in the 
area. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we believe (the deal) will ultimately be approved and why all of us 
are cooperating completely and fully in providing anything that anybody (in the 
Justice Department) wants," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Robert Geddes, Irvine Meadows' managing partner, nor his partners -- 
developer Donald M. Koll and Newport Beach attorney Paul Hegness -- could be 
reached for comment. Geddes is also a partner in Avalon Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon Attractions President Brian Murphy said, "I don't know if I should 
comment. The U.S. Department of Justice has started an investigation into 
whether or not they feel this move is being made to eliminate competition 
between the two facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Like Avalon Attractions' arrangement with Irvine Meadows, Nederlander has had 
an exclusive right to promote concerts at the Pacific Amphitheatre. Nederlander 
books and operates the Pacific on a 40-year lease with the state-owned Orange 
County Fair, on whose property the amphitheater was built. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether other promoters would enjoy the same access to the Pacific as 
Nederlander is hoping to gain at Irvine Meadows, Papiano said, "Yes, that is a 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
If that is true, for the first time Orange County could become an open field 
for concert promoters. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego rock promoter Bill Silva said he would "absolutely" be interested in 
booking shows at the Orange County amphitheaters. "There would be a few 
instances a year where, if the venues were open to us, we'd love to book them. 
. . . That's why we are watching with great interest what happens in Orange 
County." 
</P>

'LUKE' MAY PROVE LUCKY FOR AMERICAN WRITERS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: TONGUE-IN-CHEEK SERIES LOOKS AT THE AMERICAN WEST. IT HAS BEEN SOLD 
IN FRANCE, ITALY AND GERMANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As a writer for prime-time hits such as "Moonlighting" and "Trapper John, 
M.D.," Carl Sautter is used to an audience of millions. But the series he's 
writing for now may never be seen in the United States -- and he thinks that 
may spell good news for other writers. 
</P>
<P>
Set to begin production April 18 in Santa Fe, N.M., "Lucky Luke," a 
tongue-in-cheek look at the American West based on a popular French comic book, 
has been sold in France, Italy and Germany. While the venture is financed by 
Italy's Cecchi Gori Group and features a largely Italian cast, headed by 
spaghetti western veteran Terence Hill, American writers were recruited to 
develop the series. (The producers are still trying to sell the series in the 
United States. It is being filmed in English and will be dubbed for other 
countries.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think American writers have any information that there is a new sort 
of world unfolding," says Sautter, the show's head writer. "I know that agents 
don't, because when I first went to my agent -- and I have a terrific agent -- 
but when I went to her and told her I wanted to do this, she said, 'What?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Lucky Luke" is part of a European production boom building toward 1992, when 
the privatization and commercialization of television in the Common Market 
countries will mean a demand for many hours of original programming. That means 
lots of work for writers, and Sautter believes many of them can be "made in the 
USA." 
</P>
<P>
Many European producers, he explains, are likely to recruit American writers 
because the U.S. product has already proven appealing to a worldwide audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created an audience for the American style of storytelling by shipping 
'Dallas,' 'Knot's Landing' and 'Hunter' (overseas)," he says. "As bad as our 
film and television are, we still have a reputation for being the ones who can 
write for a world audience." 
</P>
<P>
Sautter sees special opportunities for freelancers and new writers trying to 
break into the business. Since European productions don't stick to the 
Hollywood rule of hiring staff writers, a show like "Luke," which would have 
employed seven or eight staff writers had it been made for a U.S. network, 
farmed out 22 script assignments. 
</P>
<P>
American writers are also a bonus to U.S. producers entering overseas 
co-production agreements, says Irwin Meyers, president of Ventura Entertainment 
Group, who recently set up projects in Greece and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"When discussing those projects with potential co-producers, they were excited 
about two things. They were excited to shoot in their countries and that we 
would bring American writers. It's a plus," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sautter advises writers not to wait around waiting for these opportunities 
to knock. He recommends reading the trade papers, nagging agents and attending 
international trade shows and festivals to make contacts. 
</P>
<P>
And Charles Slocum, director of industry analysis for the Writers Guild, adds 
writers must be willing to work on shows that aren't necessarily household 
words -- and aren't likely to become so. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all the good work will be in the TV Guide anymore," Slocum said. "Don't 
poo-poo working on a foreign production because you think, 'Oh, I'll never get 
paid,' or "I don't want to fly to Australia.' " 
</P>
<P>
While he was hesitant to call "Lucky Luke" a wave of the future, Slocum said 
that the series is a "healthy sign" for American writers. " 'Lucky Luke' is a 
nice symbolic series to start the decade, and before the decade is over we'll 
see many more like it."

PLAY BALL! They don't call it the national pastime for nothing. . . . More 
Americans play baseball and its little brother, softball, than any other sport 
in the nation. . . . The American Softball Assn. enrolled 226,000 teams in 
organized leagues last year -- an estimated 3 million players. . . . Santa Ana 
alone fielded 190 teams, mostly slo-pitch, with about 3,200 male and female 
players taking up every ball field in the city six days a week. Steve Emmons

STAMP OF GREATNESS: Tim Wallach grew up in Orange County and became an All-Star 
third baseman for the Montreal Expos. . . . Now Wallach is among the baseball 
players enshrined on postage stamps by the tiny Caribbean island of St. 
Vincent. . . . Why this honor from a British Commonwealth nation that prefers 
cricket? Because St. Vincent's stamps are printed by a New York firm that 
selects subjects titillating to stamp collectors. . . . Baseball is hot 
property, the firm says, but the sport "has no relevance at all to St. 
Vincent," said an island official. Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky

STREET SHRINES: The season opens today (C1 and special Baseball '90 section, 
S1) but it's baseball year-round in northeast Placentia, where the streets are 
named after Hall-of-Famers Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Ducky Medwick, Ted Williams, 
Stan Musial, Christy Mathewson and others. . . . Baseball stars are one of the 
official categories for Placentia street names, probably adopted by some 
long-forgotten sports fan, said Public Works Director Bob Hodson. . . . Next: 
streets named after famous athletes from Placentia, such as Olympic swimming 
gold medalist Janet Evans and tennis star Michael Chang. Steve Emmons and Mark

"Going once, going twice," auctioneer Mel Giller roared at a canopied crowd of 
1,000 people gathered on a sunny hillside here Sunday for Orange County's first 
large-scale new house auction since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I hear 3-45?," Giller asked in a sort of half-Texan, half-New York twang. 
"We're not selling chopped liver by the pound here folks. Look at what you're 
getting." 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by his family, Chaslav Radovich, owner of Newport Beach-based Best 
Electronics, which markets computer chips, nervously held up his bidding card 
for a spanking-new four-bedroom, three-bath, 2,420-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of 39 Mediterranean-style, tile-roofed houses in the Pacific Shores 
development auctioned-off Sunday by Santa Clara-based Dividend Development 
Corp. All this in the midst of a housing sales slump affecting even this South 
County region of desirable, coastal-view properties. The houses here were 
originally advertised at prices ranging from $371,000 to $596,000 at a time 
when the county's median price of new and used houses is $252,300. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Watson, Dividend's president, had used the auction technique before in 
Northern California, but this was the first large-scale auction of homes in 
Orange County since Eagle Ridge was sold off to bidders on a nearby hill nine 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's stated goal Sunday was to sell all 39 houses in order to get out from 
under the big construction loan he was carrying at a time when demand for homes 
in this price range has almost dried up. But Watson said he uses auctions even 
when the market is hot. "This is the optimum form of a free market," he said. 
"And it works very well." 
</P>
<P>
Across the tent from the Radoviches, John Izbicki, a hydrologist for the U.S. 
Geological Survey and his wife, Becky, a computer programmer, combed over the 
list of houses cheerlessly. Their 12-year-old son Jeff, clad in a blue Memphis 
State University sweat shirt, looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"We just moved from New Hampshire two weeks ago," said Becky Izbicki. "We're 
living in a hotel in Dana Point. We need to get a house desperately." 
</P>
<P>
But the prices were going too high for the Izbickis. 
</P>
<P>
"Sold for 3-45," Giller shouted. Baba Radovich shrieked with joy. "It's my 
house!" she said. She kissed her son Chaslav, who was buying the house for her. 
"Isn't he a nice son?" she said. "He wants me to live in style." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd overflowed from under the big canopy to a grassy knoll. But those sun 
worshipers, as Giller called them, simply weren't bidding much. Indeed, out of 
the 1,000 people attending, fewer than half had pre-qualified financially as 
required for Sunday's auction. The rest were the curious, the hopeful -- those 
who said they decided to come at the last minute in search of their dream home, 
only to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to get a steal, I can't steal a house here," said Arnold Jaspers, an 
Anaheim aerospace engineer. Visibly disgusted with the proceedings, Jaspers 
simply got up and left. 
</P>
<P>
So did Danny and Maria Miller of Buena Park, who brought their 2-year-old 
daughter Tanya and a stroller packed with blankets and food. Before the bidding 
opened, the Millers said they were not willing to go above $200,000 for any of 
the Pacific Shores houses, even though a move to South County has been a dream 
of theirs for years. 
</P>
<P>
"For these prices, we ought to get houses of at least 3,000 square feet," 
complained Danny Miller, who works for Pacific Bell. "And these lots are 
smaller than I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were bargains to be found. Partly as a marketing strategy, the 
auction started with the models, which Giller said had about $100,000 worth of 
upgrades and ranged from $473,000 to $596,000, pre-auction. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of generating high bids, the models -- decorated with areca palm 
trees, framed museum posters and landscaped with pink geraniums and white 
alyssum, went for deep discounts -- $420,000 in the case of the biggest, 
top-priced model home, and $335,000 for the smallest. 
</P>
<P>
"That's lower than normal," said one of Giller's eight or so bidding 
assistants, most of whom are former cattle auctioneers from Texas. Known as 
ring callers because they encourage and spot the bids in the audience and shout 
them up to the podium, they were all dressed Sunday in turquoise shirts, white 
slacks and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
After the models went, the bidding intensified. Giller was selling houses at 
the rate of one every two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the successful bidders: 
</P>
<P>
* Russ and and Frances Berberian of Pasadena, who paid $410,000 for a house 
originally listed at $496,000, a savings of $86,000. "It's sure exciting," said 
Frances Berberian. "We want to spend our summers here." 
</P>
<P>
* Glenn and Cheryl Nieberle of La Habra Heights, who plunked down $322,500 for 
a house that was supposed to sell at $406,000. "I think the prices were 
inflated to begin with," said Glenn Nieberle, a certified public accountant. 
"We went over our $300,000 limit, but it was still attractive. Without the 
auction we wouldn't have been able to buy anything here." 
</P>
<P>
* Terry and Margarita Holt of Manhattan Beach, who bought a house listed at 
$393,000 for $342,500. "I think I got it under market," said Terry Holt. "I 
really took a chance because the original prices seemed to be inflated." Holt, 
a Culver City firefighter, said the couple have invested in several properties 
in recent years and rent them out. They planned to do the same here. "We'll 
probably keep it for at least five years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* David and Ranaazahar Ali of West Covina, accompanied by their son Asad, 2, 
bid $405,000 for a house listed at $503,000. A self-employed mechanical 
engineer and consultant, David Ali said he was not worried about the long 
commute to work because he can adjust his work schedule. "This is all very 
impressive, very well organized," he said. "They obviously want your money." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's auction pulled in $13,669,750, or about 74% of the aggregate list 
price of $18,041,000, for the houses, according to auction officials. 
</P>
<P>
Before seeing the figures, Giller had predicted that the final tally would be 
between $13 million and $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It went about as well as expected," said Giller, whose auction firm stood to 
gain a 3% to 6% commission. Watson, Dividend's president, was unavailable, but 
Giller said Watson had been pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"A good auction is where everyone walks out a winner," said Giller. "This was a 
good auction."

LANDSCAPE LAW WOULD SAVE WATER AND ENERGY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE PROPOSED IRVINE ORDINANCE THAT CALLS FOR GROUPING PLANTS WITH 
SIMILAR NEEDS WOULD EXEMPT SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.

<P>
The city that declared war on chlorofluorocarbons has a new enemy: turf grass. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan that city officials say could help save the environment, lush 
lawns are out and landscaping is in. The city that seems to put a premium on 
conformity is now working on an ordinance that would regulate landscaping right 
down to what types of plants can be grown side by side. 
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that all the mowing, mulching, fertilizing and watering of 
turf grass is ultimately more harmful to the atmosphere than the benefits 
derived from the oxygen-producing greenery, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, yet to be finalized, could apply to new businesses and 
portions of condominium developments but would exempt single-family residences; 
public land would also be regulated. City officials say it promises to reduce 
energy costs, pollution, water use and landfill waste while also cutting back 
on costs for materials and equipment used to maintain turf grass. 
</P>
<P>
It also calls for grouping together plants that have the same climate, soil and 
maintenance needs. 
</P>
<P>
Planners say there are simply more water-efficient and environmentally 
sensitive ways to landscape the city than the way it has been done up to now. 
For example, to install and maintain just one acre of landscaping each year, 
Irvine uses four acre-feet of water (1.3 million gallons, equivalent to a 
year's supply for eight families of four), applies 250 to 300 pounds of 
fertilizer and uses 102 gallons of gasoline for mowers to cut grass. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our primary thrust is to say that turf grass does not make good 
environmental sense in our area," said Robert Perry, a Cal Poly Pomona 
professor of landscape architecture who helped write the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that just as people want to keep their cars, they want to keep their 
lawns. But that might not be the best thing for the environment, he said. "The 
landscape is just another way of manufacturing pollution," because of the way 
we maintain it, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed by Councilman Cameron Cosgrove, grew out of a City Council 
directive last year aimed at water conservation in landscaping. While other 
areas of California, such as Santa Barbara, have written ordinances concerning 
landscaping in response to drought conditions, Irvine's is likely the most 
comprehensive, city planners believe. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, there will be three basic plant groups for ornamental 
landscapes: subtropical, Mediterranean and temperate. 
</P>
<P>
Bougainvillea, for example, will be clumped with blue dracaena, because they 
are both subtropical plants. But one would not plant a lavender starflower, a 
subtropical shrub, next to a weeping willow, a temperate tree, because the 
starflower prefers warmth and humidity while the willow prefers cold 
temperatures and moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Some areas along creeks and natural drainage swales will be allowed to remain 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great difficulty in directing and maintaining a landscape that is 
comprised of so many elements. This diversity is not desirable when there is no 
sensible order to it," the draft report said. "In fact, a great number of 
conflicts between plant tolerances and preferences occur. A more logical method 
of plant organization is to select and combine various species on the basis of 
climactic and habitat adaptations." 
</P>
<P>
Landscape designers say they have begun incorporating drought-resistant plants 
in some of their plans because they need less water and thus are often cheaper 
to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's getting on the bandwagon," said Gus Puertas, who works for the 
Tustin-based landscape architecture firm Frank Radmacher &amp; Associates. 
"That dominoes down the line." 
</P>
<P>
But there are problems finding enough drought-resistant plants because many 
nurseries don't carry them. Clients also sometimes have their own ideas about 
how they want a landscape to look and must be persuaded to explore other 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ongoing challenge," Jason Umemoto, a landscape designer, said of 
persuading clients. He added that using drought-resistant plants "doesn't mean 
you have to have rocks and cactus." 
</P>
<P>
But planners for the master-planned city say the ordinance will encourage 
diversity because so many different kinds of plants can be used and because 
developers would be encouraged to use something different rather than an old, 
water-guzzling standby. 
</P>
<P>
"More than likely, you'll have the ability to put more color into a landscape," 
said Tim Kirkham, the city's landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
But Perry said that doesn't mean Irvine necessarily will look all that 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"We would say that in terms of its character and appearance, it's going to be 
very similar . . . ," Perry said. "We're not going to have a desert look." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran added: "The ordinance simply represents a growing sensitivity 
to the need to landscape in ways consistent with the climate of our region. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern, of course, that we somehow would be providing for a 
barren and brown sort of future for ourselves, which of course is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful selection of plant species actually provides for a much richer 
landscaping but at a lesser cost." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which will be considered by the council next month, would also 
require that new developments' landscapes not have more than 25% turf grass; 
20% of them must be designed to use composted organic matter, and 40% of paved 
surfaces within parking lots shall be shaded by "parking lot trees." 
</P>
<P>
And there are directives about water. New landscapes will not be allowed to use 
more than two acre-feet of potable water or more than three acre-feet of 
reclaimed water per acre each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to use less water and still make the landscape look really 
good," Kirkham said. "Irvine didn't hit a crisis point and say 'Gee whiz, we're 
running out of water, let's enact an ordinance.' What we'd say is if we haven't 
planted grass yet, let's consider how much we want to plant." 
</P>
<P>
City planners say if the ordinance is adopted, developers who refuse to comply 
would not be given permits. They are still trying to decide what enforcement 
action would be taken against those who refused once their projects were 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of an apple pie and motherhood issue," Kirkham said. "No one wants 
to achieve an uglier urban environment." 
</P>
<P>
Like the city's ordinance clamping down on the manufacture of ozone-eroding 
CFCs, Irvine planners say the new "Sustainability in Landscaping Ordinance" 
will be at the forefront of similar plans in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the new direction that certain communities are going to," Perry said. 
"I think Irvine will rise to that challenge." 
</P>
<P>
But will the community buy it? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will," Perry said. "I think that people are becoming more 
sophisticated" about the way communities can impact the environment.

PANEL REJECTS PLAN FOR HOUSING NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE NICOLOSI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission has rejected a proposed housing plan for the city, 
saying that it unfairly places the bulk of the planned low-cost housing in Old 
Town and the Hill Area. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which outlines how the city will deal with future housing needs, was 
also rejected because it didn't point out that the high cost of land made it 
difficult to provide low-cost housing in Seal Beach, Development Director Lee 
Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to meet again on April 18 to amend and vote on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The document, which was sent to the state Department of Housing and Community 
Development last month for comments, includes suggestions that the city 
investigate the possibility of encouraging high-density, low-income housing on 
two five-acre sites in the city; the conversion of an unspecified building into 
one-room apartments for the homeless; zoning changes to encourage low-cost 
housing, and financial incentives for developers of low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
After the state has commented on the plan, the city staff plans to revise it so 
that all areas of the city equally share the burden of providing low-cost 
housing. The staff will also add a section explaining the difficulty of 
providing low-cost housing in an expensive beach community. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

CITY TO RESEARCH WAYS TO PAY FOR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga and the 
city staff to research ways to pay for a new $11-million pier. 
</P>
<P>
The study will include the possibility of a city bond issue to pay for part of 
the cost of the new pier, which is scheduled to be under construction by Nov. 
1. The city's old pier, built in 1914, has been closed since July, 1988, 
because of storm and wave damage. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only $7.5 million of the $11-million cost has been raised from state 
and federal funds and private donations. The City Council is considering hiring 
a professional fund-raiser, but some city officials question whether even a 
professional firm could raise the $3.5 million by the end of this year. Former 
Mayor Ron Shenkman, who heads the city's volunteer fund-raising committee, told 
the City Council that the shortfall on the pier might even exceed $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd better not look into just raising $3.5 million because we may need more," 
Shenkman said, possibly as much as $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The city will not know the exact cost of a new pier until bids are sought later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays has said he does not think that the city should seek a 
pier bond issue "except as a last resort." Mays said residents of the city need 
assurances that "all other avenues have been tried" before the city proposes a 
bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman John Erskine has said he thinks that a bond issue is needed and 
must soon be considered. Erskine said he favors having both a professional 
fund-raiser and a bond issue to pay for the pier and for a $2.5-million plaza 
at the head of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will receive a report in early May on proposals for funding 
the pier. BILL BILLITER

SCHOOL DISTRICT CELEBRATES 25 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

If there had been a "Just Say No" program for schools in Garden Grove in 1965, 
recalled former district Supt. Hilton D. Bell, the goal would have been to 
prevent kids from sneaking Marlboros rather than snorting cocaine or injecting 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that kids smoking was pretty bad back then," said Bell, 80, the 
district's first superintendent, who met recently with other officials to 
celebrate the district's 25th anniversary. "The use of drugs in society was a 
problem we really didn't anticipate." 
</P>
<P>
Officials also didn't anticipate the demographic changes that turned the Garden 
Grove Unified School District from a mostly Anglo population to a mix of 
Latinos, Asians and other ethnic minorities. And the last 25 years have also 
seen the district's budget increase from $23.4 million to $151.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more challenges now than there were in the mid-'60s, when 
times were somewhat simpler," said Dr. Edward Dundon, the district's current 
superintendent. "The problems with language, drugs, gangs, family breakdown. 
But if you were to go to sleep for 25 years and wake up and see what a typical 
high school student's like, you'd find that he wouldn't be that different." 
</P>
<P>
The district was formed in 1965 after voters approved the merger of the former 
Alamitos School District, the Garden Grove Elementary School District and the 
Garden Grove Union High School District. The new district started with 54,000 
students, but enrollment has dropped to 36,725. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974-75, the first school year in which ethnic breakdowns were recorded, the 
district reported that its student population was 84.2% Anglo, 12.9% Latino and 
1.8% Asian. Currently, the Anglo population is 39%, Latinos 32%, Asians 25%, 
blacks 2%, Pacific Islanders 1% and Filipinos 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the changes, Dundon believes student performance has remained 
fairly consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our math scores are about the same, and taking into account language problems, 
our languages scores are pretty close too," Dundon said. "The color of the 
kids' eyes may be different, but I just feel that kids haven't changed that 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who has worked as a consultant since retiring from the district in 1968, 
said the biggest educational development over the past 25 years has been "the 
involvement of parents and the community along with the educational staff to 
determine the needs of the schools." JAMES TORTOLANO

RAIL RIGHTS OF WAY FOCUS OF CITY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will study the potential for use of existing railroad rights of way 
for light-rail service for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report to the City Council, City Manager Lee Risner noted that 
other Orange County cities, including Santa Ana, Anaheim, Irvine, Costa Mesa, 
Huntington Beach and Fullerton, are studying the use of light rail to reduce 
traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of all of the discussion regarding transportation, and since cities 
are looking at light rail for public transport, it is probably not a good idea 
to give up any rights of way at this time," Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the lack of a freeway running parallel to Imperial Highway, Risner 
suggested that a rail system might reduce traffic on Imperial and Whittier 
Boulevard, both state highways. DAVID F. BURKE

CITY TO BUY PROPERTY FOR SENIORS COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has agreed unanimously to buy property on East Amerige Avenue 
for an apartment building for low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The owner, First Lutheran Church of Fullerton, has offered to sell the property 
for $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, agreed to search for a 
developer willing to build up to 50 studio or one-bedroom apartments and keep 
the rents affordable for low- and moderate-income seniors for the life of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The city would sell the land at a discount and might agree to pay for other 
improvements at the site to attract a builder willing to keep rents low, 
redevelopment manager Terry M. Galvin said.

ANTIQUATED EARNINGS TEST AN INJUSTICE TO SENIOR CITIZENS; 
</P>
<P>
THE DEPRESSION-ERA LAW PUNISHES OLDER AMERICANS WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN THE 
WORK FORCE. IT HAS OUTLIVED ITS USEFULNESS AND SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON PACKARD and Ron Packard is the Republican representative for the 43rd 
Congressional District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two centuries Americans have believed that they can achieve any goal if 
they are willing to work for it. They savor the fact that their government will 
allow them to fulfill their dreams and live a life unburdened by an oppressive 
"big brother." But something has gone dreadfully wrong in America, and its 
older citizens are paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
The American dream has been tarnished by what is known as the Social Security 
Earnings Test. It is a law that should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
I have introduced a corrective bill in the Congress (HR 311) and am an original 
supporter of Rep. J. Dennis Hastert's (R-Ill.) bill, the Older Americans 
Freedom to Work Act (H.R. 2460). Both measures will end this discriminatory 
practice. The Social Security Earnings Test has outlived its usefulness. It is 
counterproductive and often dulls what should be the "golden years" for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of senior citizens, many Orange County residents among them, are 
being taxed into poverty by the Social Security Earnings Test, which reduces 
Social Security benefits by $1 for every $3 a senior citizen earns above $9,360 
annually. Combined with regular federal income and Social Security taxes, 
thousands of older Americans are being taxed at a rate that exceeds 56% -- 
higher than the rate for millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
So how did this regressive and unproductive test become policy? It was born out 
of Depression-era reforms in 1935 to create jobs during the most grim economic 
period in U.S. history. Millions of older Americans were discouraged from 
staying employed. The earnings test reduced their overall income, making it 
unproductive for them to work beyond retirement age. This meant younger workers 
with families could have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as we face great challenges to the economic health of our country, it is 
clear that this policy is senseless and harmful. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor now warns that as we enter the 1990s, there will 
be serious labor shortages. The nation's retirement rate has increased more 
than 40% in the past 20 years. Today more than 80% of all men and 92% of all 
women over the age of 65 are retired. In the next 10 years, 5 million Americans 
will retire, while there will be a 1.5-million decline in the number of younger 
people entering the work force. 
</P>
<P>
As labor shortages spread across the country, we cannot afford disincentives to 
work. Seniors represent an obvious source of labor that will be needed well 
into the 21st Century. They have invaluable experience and know-how; and yet, 
the earnings test is driving them away at an alarming rate. If seniors are 
physically capable and want to continue to work, they should be able to do so 
without being penalized. 
</P>
<P>
Older Americans are staying out of the work force because of the punishing 
nature of the earnings test. An estimated 1 million people opt not to work 
because of this cap on their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Why work when you are denied the full value of your labor? Another 1 million 
seniors work knowing that their Social Security benefits are cut because of the 
stringent earnings test. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony here is that, in trying to limit the cost of Social Security 
benefits, the federal government is denying itself as much as $3.2 billion in 
income tax revenue that could be generated by eliminating the earnings test. It 
makes no sense to perpetuate such an oppressive policy and its detrimental 
effect on our nation's economic health. 
</P>
<P>
While the economic cost is great, the human cost is even greater. The earnings 
test is relegating thousands of seniors who want or need to work to 
unproductive, unfulfilling lives. Meddling with the right to work goes against 
the very grain of the beliefs and values on which our nation was founded. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, we are singling out one group for undue hardship. Eliminating the 
earnings test would bring much-deserved liberty to the lives of seniors who 
have the right to choose how they wish to live their lives. In addition, 
permitting older Americans to work allows them to be independent and free of 
the government dole. It will allow them to have a happier and higher quality of 
life. A self-supportive citizen is not a burden on the government. 
</P>
<P>
We all should work to rid our system of this injurious practice. The Social 
Security Earnings Test must be replaced. It has outlived its usefulness, and 
now only serves only to hinder our country in its challenge to remain a world 
economic power.

MIKE DOWNEY: FLOYD PLAYS IT SAFE, ENDS UP SORRY

<DATELINE>
<P>
AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has taken the British a couple of hundred years to strike back at the 
colonials, but they have bloody well done so, marching in formation across 
rolling green fields, sticks in hand, at the specific and extremely painful 
expense of a 47-year-old former U.S. Army brat name of Raymond Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the more obvious drama of attempting to become the oldest Masters golf 
champion ever, Ray Floyd had a chance to erase the memory of one of the truly 
aggravating experiences of his career, the failure of the U.S. team he 
captained to bring home the Ryder Cup from Great Britain last summer. Instead, 
Floyd's playoff defeat at the hands of Nick Faldo permitted a Brit to win this 
uniquely American sporting event for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot imagine, just cannot imagine how this feels," Floyd said. "I have 
never felt like this. I have never had anything affect me the way this is 
affecting me." 
</P>
<P>
In America we have an unhappy habit of denying sympathy to the rich and famous, 
simply because they have what they have. The fact that Raymond Floyd has been 
winning professional golf tournaments for 27 years and has a wall full of 
glass-framed magazine covers in the den of his $2 million home on Miami's 
Biscayne Bay might somehow strain the notion of feeling sorry for a golfer, of 
all people, just because the poor soul had a bad day. 
</P>
<P>
But Floyd's heartache was real. Here he was, four strokes ahead and six holes 
away from the golfing academy's Best Costume award, Augusta National's green 
sport coat. He was out there pumping his fists Kirk Gibson-style after a birdie 
at No. 12, shrugging off a ball misdirected by his playing partner's marker at 
No. 14, clapping for himself after a par-saving putt at No. 16, then suddenly 
failing to find his way home safely in what became a man-eating obstacle course 
of water and sand. 
</P>
<P>
The putts got longer and longer, and the approach shots pinballed from bunker 
to bunker, and finally a tee shot died a cruel underwater death. By the end, 
Floyd's fate had been so far removed from his own hands that he could not even 
putt out. He could only pick up. Pick up his golf ball, pick up the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I competed marvelously well," Floyd said at one point afterward, sounding 
distinctly British. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to tell himself and anyone else willing to listen that it mattered not 
who came along to conquer him. Beaten was beaten. Another first prize for 
Faldo? Good for Faldo. Long live the king. "It doesn't matter who he is or 
where he's from," Floyd maintained. 
</P>
<P>
It just as easily could have been Langer the German, or Ozaki the Japanese, or 
Ballesteros the Spaniard out there making the charge against him, making three 
birdies over the last six holes the way Faldo did. Floyd said he would have 
felt just as bad. He also felt he would have played the same way, playing 
everything safe, taking no unnecessary chances, daring the challenger to do the 
catching. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the ropes of Augusta's gallery, more than one person was getting sleepy 
watching Floyd. He had this tournament in his Bell Telephone-sponsored bag. He 
had another green jacket -- maybe the same one he won 14 years ago -- waiting 
to be slipped over his triangle-patterned, Nabisco cookie-box shirt. Spectators 
were yawning, same way they have at all the other lopsided championship events 
of the past calendar year -- the NBA finals (swept in four games), World Series 
(also swept in four), Super Bowl (a 45-point rout) and Final Four (a 30-point 
rout). 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Faldo came on strong. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd was supposed to be at his best as a front-runner, a horse more than happy 
to get out early. He was up by eight strokes after three rounds when he won in 
1976. He was the ice-water man, the soldier's son from Fort Bragg, N.C., who 
preferred to march out front. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there was a PGA tour event a few years ago in Westchester County, 
N.Y., that Floyd was leading on the final day, until his nerves so got the best 
of him that he blew up to 77 and lost. That day he said: "I wanted to win so 
badly that I wasn't Ray Floyd out there." He no longer played like himself. 
</P>
<P>
And that is precisely what happened at the 54th Masters. Ray Floyd stopped 
being Ray Floyd. He played to safe portions of greens and lagged putts short. 
Not until he really took a whack at a long, treacherous, toboggan-run of a putt 
at the 17th did he show any boldness. He played with considerable caution and 
care -- "even though it's not my nature." 
</P>
<P>
It cost him dearly. It became his Masters of disaster. It turned into another 
Grand Slam for Great Britain, during a weekend when 1988 champion Sandy Lyle 
had just become the butt of half the jokes being told in Augusta for having 
conked more spectators' skulls with errant shots over the course of a few days 
than Gerald Ford had in his entire term in the Presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Ray Floyd who has the headache, and there isn't much he can do about 
it. Nobody his age has ever won the British Open. Guess he should shoot for 
that.

FALDO REPEATS BY STAYING HIGH AND DRY;

LEADING BY FOUR STROKES WITH SIX HOLES LEFT IN REGULATION.

<P>
As Britain's Nick Faldo went to the the first playoff hole, the 10th, with 
Raymond Floyd early Sunday evening, he wondered whether fate would turn on him. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year ago in a strikingly similar Masters playoff with Scott Hoch that 
Faldo won with a 25-foot birdie putt on the 11th hole after surviving at the 
10th when Hoch missed what would have been a winning two-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time, it was Floyd, who opened the door for another Masters victory 
for Faldo by hitting his second shot into the water at the 11th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo only had to two-putt from about 18 feet to defend his championship -- 
which he did easily with a ceremonial tap-in. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Faldo became the first player to repeat as Masters champion since 
Jack Nicklaus in 1965-1966. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Faldo played the regulation 18 holes with Nicklaus and then mused 
later, "If Jack was here now I would ask him to present the green jacket to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The green jacket is worn by Masters champions and the coat fits Faldo for the 
second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who had a four-stroke lead in the regulation round with six holes to 
play, was shocked by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most devastating thing that has happened to me in my career," said 
Floyd, who, at 47, was bidding to become the oldest player ever to win the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo had to come out of a bunker and make a four-foot putt to get par and stay 
even with Floyd at the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
"As I stood over the putt, I thought about Scott (Hoch) last year and maybe it 
might all go back on me this time," Faldo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I went to 11 and had mixed emotions, thinking maybe this was my hole, 
which it was." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd wasn't sure whether he pulled his seven-iron shot into the water on No. 
11, or whether he was lined up incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked up and the ball was going into the water," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
He took a drop, and his only chance to par the hole was to sink his pitch shot. 
He wasn't close and Faldo, who had hit an eight iron to the green, had the 
championship by two-putting. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third major title for Faldo, who won the British Open in 1987. His 
victory was worth $225,000 in the $1.25 million tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Floyd, who hasn't played regularly because of his commitment as 
captain of the Ryder Cup team the last two years, was destined to win. 
</P>
<P>
No one was charging at him and he reasoned that he only had to make pars on the 
back nine to win his second Masters in a span of 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, who was three strokes behind Floyd at the outset of the round, began the 
day on inauspicious note when he double-bogeyed the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old pro from Surrey, England, didn't make his charge until he made 
birdies at the 13th, 15th and 16th holes. 
</P>
<P>
That left him only one shot behind Floyd. And he drew even when Floyd three 
putted the 17th green for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo was playing one hole ahead of Floyd and, when the Brit parred the 18th 
hole, it was up to Floyd to either win, lose or send the tournament into a 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd pulled his tee shot on the 18th hole into a fairway bunker -- the same 
bunker that Sandy Lyle came out of to within 10 feet of the pin to win the 
Masters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd couldn't emulate Lyle's feat, though. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty close to being a good shot," Floyd said of his seven iron that 
found a greenside bunker. Floyd blasted to within five feet of the cup and made 
his putt to force the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd shot par 72 for 18 holes, while Faldo shot 69. All of the other 
contenders faded down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who was five strokes behind Floyd at the outset of the round, bogeyed 
three of the last five holes and finished with a 74 and a 72-hole total of 285. 
</P>
<P>
John Huston, a first-time player here, who was only two shots behind Floyd at 
the start of the round, bogeyed four of the first seven holes. 
</P>
<P>
However, he rallied later to finish in a tie for third at 283 with Lanny 
Wadkins, who finished with a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples got to six under at the 15th hole, but the Los Angeles Open 
champion bogeyed the next two holes. He wound up at 284, one shot ahead of 
Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus said Faldo was nervous all day. 
</P>
<P>
"It took him a long time to play shots but, when he did, he played them well," 
Nicklaus said. "It was at the 15th hole (where Faldo got a birdie) that he 
began to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, 50, was trying to win his seventh Masters title. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm disappointed," he said. "At the age of 50, I'm not going to get 
that many chances to win the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he paused and said, "Only one." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd wouldn't second-guess himself for playing conservatively with a four-shot 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my nature," he said, "but that's what the situation dictated." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought when he was four strokes ahead after his birdie at the 
12th hole, Floyd said: "I didn't think I could lose." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "I didn't play the way I needed to play. It was a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
However, it was his iron shot that went into the water bordering the left side 
of the 11th green that finally did him in. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo was asked what was going through his mind when Floyd's shot went into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"I still had to stay in the right frame of mind," Faldo said. "I still had to 
make four. I just angled an eight iron to the right side and it came up perfect 
below the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo said he was more emotional about his victory this year than he was in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same deal as last year, coming from behind and just plugging away," 
Faldo said. 
</P>
<P>
Is he the best player in the world right now? "Right now I feel good about my 
game," Faldo said. "But week in and week out, who knows who is the going to be 
the best player?" 
</P>
<P>
Faldo never believed that he was playing for second, but the realization came 
on the final holes that the field was narrowed to himself and Floyd when 
Nicklaus began to falter. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he was surprised when Floyd's second shot went into the water 
because he has played so many pressure shots in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo became the fifth foreign player to win the Masters in the last eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with Nicklaus was an inspiration to him, he said, because he grew up 
watching Masters win his early Masters titles. 
</P>
<P>
Now Faldo's goal will be to win a third consecutive Masters title. 
</P>
<P>
All he needs to do is get into a playoff and stay even until he reaches his 
favorite hole, the 11th.

IN '40, FELLER GAVE HIMSELF A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the second inning of the American League's 1940 season opener between the 
Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians, Bob Feller walked the bases loaded and 
was visited on the mound by Oscar Vitt, the Cleveland manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wild, on the verge of walking myself out of the game," Feller said in 
recollection the other day. "Oscar asked how I felt and I told him that I 
thought I could get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been later in the game or, maybe, later in the season he might have 
taken me out." 
</P>
<P>
And major league baseball would still be without an opening day no-hitter, for 
Feller struck out Bob Kennedy, ending that second-inning threat, overcame five 
walks and pitched the Indians to a 1-0 victory in which he did not allow a hit. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990 season opens today, the 71-year-old Feller is celebrating the 
golden anniversary -- April 16 is the official date -- of that first and last 
opening-day no-hitter, fashioned before a crowd of 14,000 at Comiskey Park on 
what Feller recalled as a cool and overcast afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like yesterday almost," Feller said by phone from his home in Gates 
Mills, Ohio, a rural suburb of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
His memory has been jogged by a spate of calls regarding the accomplishment and 
the release of a book he wrote in collaboration with Bill Gilbert, "Now 
Pitching, Bob Feller." 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes on it becomes more and more important and something of a trivia 
and nostalgia piece because baseball has never had another (no-hitter on 
opening day)," Feller said. "It's a nice honor and I appreciate the attention, 
but it certainly wasn't the greatest game I ever pitched. 
</P>
<P>
"I had much better stuff in many other games, including the no-hitter I pitched 
against the (New York) Yankees in 1946. I had 11 strikeouts in that game." 
</P>
<P>
At 21 and embarking on his fifth major league season after coming off a farm in 
Van Meter, Iowa, to spend parts of the 1936 and '37 seasons with the Indians 
before becoming a 1938 regular, Feller struck out eight in that opening-day 
no-hitter of 1940, the first of his three no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
He also pitched 12 one-hitters, a major league record, and said, "I'd be the 
first to admit that you have to be lucky (to pitch a no-hitter). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many I'd have pitched if it hadn't been for a broken-bat hit 
or a ball lost in the wind or a pop fly that fell between two fielders who 
didn't call for it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of the game and I'm not complaining. I'm just saying you have to 
be lucky, and I probably was in that opening-day game, considering I didn't 
have my best stuff." 
</P>
<P>
He definitely didn't have it in his final tuneup, being belted for 10 runs and 
15 hits in a five-inning exhibition stint against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I was in condition with no aches and pains I wasn't concerned," 
Feller said. "That's all it was was a tuneup, and I didn't want to beat my 
brains out in that game and have nothing against the White Sox." 
</P>
<P>
The Times' front page headline on the morning of April 16 read: "British Troops 
Land in Norway Harbors for Hitler Showdown." 
</P>
<P>
There was a box providing "The War at a Glance." The car dealer, Earle C. 
Anthony, was selling Packards starting at $867. Foreman and Clark advertised a 
two-pants suit at $25. 
</P>
<P>
And in that era long before free agency and arbitration, Rapid Robert Feller, 
his 100-m.p.h. fastball having already put him on the cover of Time magazine 
and helped produce records of 17-11 and 24-9 in 1938 and '39, was guaranteed a 
1940 salary of what now seems to be a very modest $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Feller writes: "When players of my era talk about changes in the 
game today, they keep coming back to the same overriding difference -- the 
declining emphasis on a team because the players are so worried about building 
up their individual numbers. That goes right back to the money factor." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about today's salaries, Feller said: 
</P>
<P>
"I do think we've seen a different emphasis on the part of the players, but if 
the owners are willing to pay, it's none of my business. The TV, attendance and 
merchandising income is so big they obviously feel they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was active in the late '50s in the formation of the first player union, but 
I never envisioned it becoming the powerful force it is today." 
</P>
<P>
Feller said the union seems to have become an unreasonable entity that feels it 
has to have the last word on every issue and no longer serves the interests of 
the players because of the obstinacy and derogatory style of its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
He said the union has replaced the negotiating table with a stone wall, but he 
acknowledged that the growth of the pension fund has provided security for many 
old-time players and that many more are expected to be covered under an 
arrangement currently being formulated by those same union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
None of that, of course, was on anyone's mind in 1940. Even the war in Europe 
seemed like a distant storm. 
</P>
<P>
Among those intent on putting it out of their thoughts and enjoying the 
Comiskey Park opener, were Feller's mom, dad and sister. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, on opening day of 1939, while in the process of watching her 
son pitch the Indians to victory in the same park, Feller's mom's day was 
disrupted when Marv Owen, the Chicago third baseman, sliced a line drive into 
the seats, striking her squarely in the face. 
</P>
<P>
She was hospitalized for two weeks with blackened eyes and assorted cuts, but 
courageously returned for opening day of 1940, when no one on the White Sox hit 
the ball -- fair or foul -- harder than Owen did the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"After that second inning, we picked up a run in the fourth and I didn't have 
any real trouble the rest of the way," Feller said. "No one on our bench would 
talk about it, but I knew what the situation was. Every pitcher does. I told 
the guys later that they didn't have to avoid it because I don't believe in 
superstitions." 
</P>
<P>
Feller had two out in the ninth when confronted by Luke Appling, the White Sox 
Hall of Fame shortstop. In his book, Feller provides interesting perspective on 
Appling and the situation: 
</P>
<P>
"Luke was 'Ol Aches and Pains' because he was always complaining of various 
hurts, but it never seemed to bother him when it came to playing some of the 
best defense of any shortstop in the majors or hitting .388 to lead the league, 
which he did four years before. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one other thing that Luke did better than anyone else in the sport 
-- hit foul balls. He was a master, the best I've ever seen at flicking his bat 
to foul off a pitch while he waited for the one he wanted. It didn't make any 
difference if he had two strikes either. He was so good at it and so confident 
in doing it that he just stood up there and took a poke at every pitch, with no 
concern that he might miss it and strike out. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up to bat with two outs and the bases empty in the ninth inning, 
determined to break up my no-hitter. Then he went into his act. The same guy 
who once fouled off 18 straight pitches, just to use up a lot of baseballs 
because he was mad at management about his contract, started doing the same 
thing to me. He knew what inning it was, that I had to be running out of gas 
pretty soon. I was a hard thrower, and by the ninth inning, hard throwers 
sometimes are tiring. 
</P>
<P>
"Appling worked the count to two balls and two strikes and then started waving 
that magic wand. He fouled off the next four or five pitches. We might still be 
there if a counter-strategy hadn't occurred to me. I wasn't going to keep 
throwing and play into his hand, so I threw the next two pitches out of the 
strike zone. That got rid of Appling with a walk. I already had issued four 
walks, so another one wasn't going to make any difference anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an intentional walk, but nobody else knew it." 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Taft Wright, a contact hitter "who always gave me trouble," Feller 
said. Wright hit a sharp grounder in the hole to the right of second baseman 
Ray Mack, who made a sprawling stop on the outfield grass, picked it up with 
his bare hand, got to his feet and nailed Wright at first. 
</P>
<P>
Said Feller: "I thought it was through when he first hit it, but Ray made a 
heck of a play. He also made a great play on a grounder Charlie Keller hit to 
save my no-hitter in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the Chicago no-hitter, Feller and the Indians returned to a 
civic celebration in Cleveland. It was an auspicious start to an auspicious 
season in which Feller went 27-11, led the league in starts with 37, complete 
games, 31; innings pitched, 321 1/3, and strikeouts, 261, in addition to 
contributing four saves in six relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, he made nine appearances and pitched 54 innings in September, 
losing his final start to Detroit, 2-0, as the Tigers edged Cleveland by a game 
for the American League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the next season, in which he went 25-13, Feller had won 107 
games, the most ever by a 22-year-old, but he then enlisted in the Navy and had 
almost four full years cut out of his Hall of Fame career. Feller retired with 
a 266-162 record but might have won 80 to 100 more games without the military 
interruption. 
</P>
<P>
Now, almost 50 years later, he is still employed by the Indians as head of 
their speakers' bureau and a part-time instructor. He tinkers with tractors on 
his rural acreage and attends card shows and old-timers' games. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox will play host to the Indians Friday afternoon, and Feller's 
opening-day no-hitter will be commemorated in a pregame ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"And next year everybody will be talking about the 50th anniversary of Joe 
DiMaggio's (56-game) hitting streak," Feller said. "That almost seems like 
yesterday, too."

THREE'S NO CROWD ON EL TORO'S MOUND; 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL: CHARGER ROTATION HAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR STANDOUTS PAIGE LAUBY, 
JENNIFER JOURDEN AND MARTA BICKERT.

EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While many high school softball coaches wish for one quality pitcher, El Toro 
Coach Jim Daugherty has been blessed with three this season. 
</P>
<P>
It's Daugherty's job to make sure there is enough mound to go around for junior 
Marta Bickert and seniors Paige Lauby and Jennifer Jourden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a unique situation," Daugherty said. "A lot of schools would love to have 
just one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The three right-handers have pitched El Toro (14-5 overall, 2-0 in the South 
Coast League) to a No. 9 ranking in the Orange County Softball Coaches' Poll. 
</P>
<P>
And the Chargers' 1-0 upset of second-ranked Irvine last week should lead to an 
even better ranking. The victory over Irvine, the defending South Coast League 
champion, also gives El Toro an edge in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty says he has been blessed with abundant pitching since he started at 
El Toro in 1986. That year Dawn Robertson and Janice Okerlund pitched El Toro 
to the Southern Section 2-A finals. Lauby and Jourden started as freshmen the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Lauby and Jourden made room for Bickert. 
</P>
<P>
"Lauby, Jourden and Bickert are all different pitchers, and it is really making 
us a lot more versatile," Daugherty said. "I think it keeps the other teams off 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
A rise ball is one of Lauby's best weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Her ball just takes off," Daugherty said. "And she's got a changeup, so she 
has been able to really dominate teams." 
</P>
<P>
Lauby (7-0) got the victory over Irvine. She struck out 15 in a strong hitting 
lineup that included Jennifer Brundage, The Times' 1989 player of the year who 
is hitting .500, Sam Lutsch (.464) and Karissa Meith (.355). 
</P>
<P>
"I was really glad to see her come out and send them a message: Our pitching 
can handle your hitting," Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
If Lauby's rise ball and changeup aren't enough, hitters also have to deal with 
Jourden's drop ball. Her drop ball stays low, comes in hard and tails away from 
right-handed hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Jourden (5-2) is the only one of the three who doesn't have a private pitching 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"She is naturally gifted pitching-wise," Lauby said. "She probably has the most 
natural talent of all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Bickert (3-2) is the future of El Toro's pitching. She transferred from Trabuco 
Hills this season when her parents moved into the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Marta has an assortment of pitches," Daugherty said. "She has a good rise, a 
good curve, a good breaking ball, an excellent change. Her biggest problem is 
she gets in situations where she wants to overpitch a little." 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty has kept the three competitive pitchers happy. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, he made it clear to his players that the team had a 
lot of quality athletes who all deserved playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the girls they would have to bite the bullet, and I was going to make 
some tough decisions that they may not like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bickert was a newcomer, Daugherty had no trouble putting her in the 
lineup right away. 
</P>
<P>
She is a really good pitcher," Daugherty said. "I have got to see what she can 
do, if she can help us or not. She is only a junior. If you've got a gun, you 
might as well shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers' attitudes have fostered a smooth relationship. Lauby welcomes the 
competition. Jourden likes the extra time off the mound. And Bickert, who was 
an All-Pacific Coast League selection in volleyball and basketball last season, 
is just happy to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pitched better this year than any other year," Lauby said. "I know it 
sounds bad, but it's because I want to do better than Marta and Jennifer. Maybe 
it's an ego thing. I want to show that I'm better than they are. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them to do badly, because I want the team to win. And if they do 
well, I know I'll have to do that much better to beat them. In fact, the better 
they do the better I try to do the next day, because I know there are two other 
pitchers and (Daugherty) doesn't have to (put me in) the next day." 
</P>
<P>
After injuring her pitching shoulder before the season, Jourden welcomes the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's even nicer now because I have two games to rest and there is always 
somebody to back me up," she said. "Plus they give me a lot of confidence, so 
it is nice." 
</P>
<P>
When she's not pitching, Jourden plays third base. Bickert and Lauby play 
first, and when Jourden's on the mound and Bickert is at first, Lauby is the 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Bickert's attitude helped the rotation go smoothly. And it helped that the trio 
got along before they were teammates. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they won't even say who is the best pitcher of the three. 
</P>
<P>
"We share equally, so we're equal pitchers," Lauby said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hard decision," Jourden said. "I'm sure we're all good in the 
different ways we pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask Daugherty for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure they are smart enough to know who I might count on more than 
another," he said. "And I figure the all-league awards will show who is the 
best."

Tom Kelly, longtime USC radio and television announcer who is now with the 
Prime Ticket network, apparently suffered a heart attack early Sunday at the 
Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, prior to a scheduled round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Saint John's Hospital in Santa Monica reported Sunday night 
that Kelly was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Carlson, who was to play in Kelly's foursome, Kelly came out 
of the Riviera locker room into the clubhouse restaurant, sat down and said, 
"I'm having a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson, who called paramedics, said Kelly was in considerable pain until after 
paramedics arrived and treated him. LARRY STEWART

Tight end Clarence Kay of the Denver Broncos says his past problem with drugs 
has created an obstacle in contract negotiations for his future. 
</P>

As a Plan B free agent, at least seven teams invited him for interviews and 
physical exams. But he said he remained in Denver because the teams that 
subsequently offered him contracts wanted to include clauses pertaining to his

DROP-OFF IN O.C. WATER SUPPLY; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT AND GROWTH REQUIRE RECLAMATION, COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Weber, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four years of drought, the possibility of a devastating water shortage is 
finally being taken seriously in Orange County and elsewhere in Southern 
California. While Orange County has a large supply of local ground water, and 
thus does not face the same acute pressures as some other areas of the 
Southland, the water situation nonetheless could soon pose a threat to economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, the Orange County Board of Supervisors came out in favor of a 
plan to cut water consumption by 10% through voluntary measures. If that 
doesn't work, some form of rationing could follow. And the long-term outlook 
for the region's water supply is grim, even if the drought ends next year. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the water challenge, residents and businesses in Orange County will 
have to conserve and otherwise work to protect water supplies. Ground water 
will have to be preserved from further contamination. Treated water from sewage 
plants will have to be "reclaimed" and used for watering lawns and the like. 
New construction and development will have to take place with an eye toward 
responsible water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas J. Reinhart, head of the Orange County office of the civil engineering 
firm ASL Consulting Engineers, has long been involved in building the pipes, 
pumps and wells that constitute the unseen underside of the water supply 
system. As a member of the Reclamation and Reuse Task Force of the California 
Water Conservation Coalition, he has been actively involved in developing 
solutions to the water problem. He spoke with Times staff writer Jonathan Weber 
about the nature of the water crisis in Orange County and some possible 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. Now that the drought is entering its fourth year, the water shortage is 
finally making headlines. How serious do you consider the water situation to be 
in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. It makes more sense to talk regionally, and regionally the water problem is 
serious. The drought may end next year, just as the '76-77 drought ended, but 
the water shortage we are now experiencing will not end with that. 
</P>
<P>
Because of some court decisions (which restricted Southern California's access 
to Colorado River water), and development, the available water supplies have 
become taxed to the point where they have a difficult time meeting the needs of 
the population. In Orange County, the population has increased greatly, but no 
new sources of water have been located for years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What was the last new source? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you discount reclaimed water, it would be the state water project 
developed in the 1960s and '70s, and that project still has not realized its 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
Q. To what extent does Orange County depend on water from outside the region? 
</P>
<P>
A. Southern Orange County is entirely dependent on imported water. There are no 
wells to speak of. Conversely, most of central and northern Orange County gets 
most of its water from ground water. In times of drought, these towns can 
decrease their use of imported water and give that to South County and increase 
the amount of pumped well water. 
</P>
<P>
But another thing that has affected Orange County to some degree, and Los 
Angeles County even more so, is ground water pollution from chemicals and 
sea-water intrusion. Some people look at the situation and say, 'We have no 
problem, because we sit on this huge lake with millions of gallons of water.' 
But not all of it is available to use in any year. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Taken as a whole, will the water problem become grave enough to affect 
economic growth in this area? 
</P>
<P>
A. It already has. In the 1976 drought, and again now, communities have used 
infrastructure such as water to limit growth. And I feel strongly that you 
should limit growth and control growth through planning processes and the 
legislative process, and then build infrastructure to serve those needs. 
</P>
<P>
It's pretty drastic if you can't water your lawn except from a hand-held 
bucket, like in Santa Barbara now. I don't think we're in that serious a 
position here if people are allowed to plan for the growth. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are some projects not being built because there is not enough water? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, maybe scaled down. Developers have to go to each agency and determine 
what their ability is to serve the development, and look at all the different 
environmental impacts. The sanitation facilities are a crucial aspect, and in 
that sense it's a double-edged sword. Bringing the water in also requires 
treating the water when you're done with it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And what sort of planning should be taking place? What possible new sources 
might there be? 
</P>
<P>
A. We'd like to see the completion of the state water project in a way that is 
environmentally sensitive. That can be solved if it is done in a non-emotional 
and logical manner. The State Water Resources Board is now holding hearings and 
will determine how much water goes to the San Francisco Bay Delta, to the 
fisheries, and to the farmers, and how much goes to municipal and industrial 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
Right now there are a lot of emotions involved, and if Northern California 
continues in the drought, there will be pressure to cut the flow down the state 
water project. 
</P>
<P>
I would also like to see more water conservation taking place. Southern 
California is a leader in accomplishing a lot of those things. We've done 
things like zero-scaping, or landscaping with plants that don't use much water 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Q. But that's not really done on a very broad basis, is it? 
</P>
<P>
A.It's starting to get more recognition as developers and various citizens 
realize the importance of going back to a desert-like atmosphere. When I first 
came out here, the big thing was this tropical atmosphere, with ferns and all 
these things that take a lot of water and don't handle dry heat very well. We 
still have a long way to go, but along the new roads being built they are now 
going to a native plant. 
</P>
<P>
Another important thing is the use of reclaimed water. I'm from St. Louis, and 
we drank water from the Mississippi River that was utilized by other people and 
put back in the river and used again. That's reclaiming water. Here, we don't 
have rivers, but we do have flows out of treatment plants that can be used for 
many safe uses such as irrigation, greenbelts, highway irrigation, parks and 
golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much water is reclaimed in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. Somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 acre-feet (there are 325,829 gallons in 
an acre-foot) per year, and there are plans to increase that dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much is that on a percentage basis? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's a small amount, less than 10% of all the water used, but it can greatly 
add to the supply. Orange County uses 350,000 acre-feet per year, maybe 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Potentially, how much water could be reclaimed? 
</P>
<P>
A. A lot of it will have to do with the way it is perceived by the public. In 
the past, the perception about reclaimed water was: 'Don't touch that or you'll 
die.' But people from the Midwest and the East are used to getting water from 
rivers that others have dumped into. I don't have any unusual-looking growths. 
There needs to be a general education for the public about how reclaimed water 
can safely be used. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Irvine, there are three high-rise buildings that use reclaimed water to 
flush toilets. This took many years to get approved, because the state Health 
Department is moving very cautiously on the kinds of uses they will approve. 
Recently I was shown a draft report by the department where they are 
reconsidering (whether to allow this kind of use of reclaimed water). The 
reasoning is that in later retrofitting by a plumber, he could connect into the 
wrong pipe, and reclaimed water would go into a faucet or a drinking fountain. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So systems that use reclaimed water have a separate set of pipes? How 
expensive is that? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't have a figure, but it's very expensive. Right here (in the Irvine 
Spectrum) there are dual systems in the ground to sprinkle the greenbelts. The 
Irvine Ranch Water District mandates that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I didn't think water coming out of treatment plants is toxic. 
</P>
<P>
A. It's not. It's highly treated. There could be plant upsets that no one knows 
about that get into the system, and the Health Department is concerned with the 
overall health effects of drinking waste water. But reclaimed water meets the 
drinking water standards, and in many instances it has less dissolved solids 
and other materials than water that people drink. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your firm is building a water system for the Irvine Coast project. How much 
reclaimed water will be used, and how much will the system cost? 
</P>
<P>
A. The project will use about 2.9-million gallons per day of domestic water, 
and an additional 3.1-million gallons of reclaimed water. The regular water 
system will cost about $25 million, and the reclaimed water system about $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the main obstacle to greater use of reclaimed water? Is it the 
health concern, or that fact that it's expensive to have double pipes? 
</P>
<P>
A. Expense is a problem, but health concerns are the major thing. The cost of 
water is going up all the time, and as the cost increases it becomes more and 
more feasible to use other sources. 
</P>
<P>
I believe we need to reclaim water on a statewide basis. Maybe it's not easy to 
convince a city like Sacramento, one that has a river flowing right by the 
doorstep, that they need to reclaim water. But I think water is a statewide 
resource. If it's good to conserve it in Southern California, it's good to 
conserve it in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, we're a north and a south, and we have been for many years. People 
in the north have a tendency to think we are taking their water, their 
resource. We have to come together and realize it's a state resource. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should businesses be doing to help address the water problems? 
</P>
<P>
A. They can ensure that their plants and facilities are utilizing water 
judiciously, just like homeowners. They need to look at places where they can 
reclaim water, or use reclaimed water, or use less water by switching to a 
different process. This has occurred in Northern California for a number of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kinds of things can real estate developers in particular do to reduce 
the amount of water consumed by new developments? 
</P>
<P>
A. When they put in large slope areas, greenbelt areas, they should be using 
reclaimed water. And they should be using native plant types. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But that is not mandatory at this point? 
</P>
<P>
A. By and large, no. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It would seem that all these new office parks with ponds and grass are 
inappropriate and contributing to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A. There is some wastefulness. They recycle that water, but there is 
evaporation. We've got to realize we are a semi-arid climate, not the tropics. 
A lot is being done, though, to bring reclaimed water to various points of use 
such as golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What needs to be done to preserve this 'huge underground lake' you referred 
to? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have to keep what's called a positive gradient in the water flowing from 
the north through the Santa Ana River watershed out to the ocean, because if we 
don't and the ground water table is lowered too much, then seawater will flow 
back in. The Orange County Water District does an excellent job of watching 
that, and they are also injecting some reclaimed water close to the interface 
between seawater and ground water to adjust the gradient. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years we have been 'mining' water, taking more out then we 
put back in. The subterranean basin covers most of central and northern Orange 
County, and all the wells penetrate into it and take water out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How is the water table replenished? 
</P>
<P>
A. The runoff from the Santa Ana river is captured and not allowed to run out 
to the ocean. That's why when you cross the river at the Santa Ana freeway it 
looks dry. That water has been intercepted and put into basins and spread and 
allowed to percolate into the ground. We've started a project for Orange County 
Water District to improve their spreading basins, so they can spread more Santa 
Ana River runoff water more efficiently and help get this huge underground lake 
back to its normal level. 
</P>
<P>
At times when other sources are reduced, we can increase the take from 
underground. But it's like a savings account: There are only so many years that 
you can mine your savings account. You have to watch it and not get to a 
critical level. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How close are we to that critical level? 
</P>
<P>
A. Everyone's concern is that, in 50 years, there has never been more than 
three consecutive dry years, and we are now entering our fourth year. Is there 
going to be a fifth? Who knows? We're not at a critical point now, but you want 
to keep something in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How big a problem is pollution of the ground water? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you'd asked 10 years ago, I would have said not too great a problem, but 
we have learned a lot since then. One big thing is our ability to measure, to 
test in parts per billion. We were fat, dumb and happy before, but now we can 
detect many things we couldn't detect previously. 
</P>
<P>
There certainly have been problems. We have had to close down the pumping at a 
number of wells, or go through very expensive treatment processes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there parts of the county that are especially hard hit by the water 
shortage? 
</P>
<P>
A. In parts of Central and South County they realize that if they don't do 
something now, they are going to be short. There's a new pipeline going into 
the upper part of Mission Viejo. It's a similar situation to the one in San 
Clemente. It's not that San Clemente doesn't have enough rights to water, it's 
just there are not enough pipelines to bring what they need. So their supply is 
short, and they're constructing another pipeline to be ready in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You mentioned that the water problem should not be used as an obstacle to 
growth. But doesn't there need to be a change of thinking, a move away from 
this idea that we do what we want to do and the water district will get the 
water from somewhere? 
</P>
<P>
A. Water purveyors should not be put in the position of stopping growth. They 
are there to serve whatever growth happens. They should be part of the planning 
process, but not the roadblock, or the means to curtail development. Don't stop 
a water project because it's growth-inducing. You figure what the growth there 
is going to be and then develop the projects to serve that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But maybe there just isn't enough water for more growth. 
</P>
<P>
A. Then you stop the growth through the planning process.

Operation of Cuba's first nuclear reactor, being built at a site about 230 
miles south of Miami, has been delayed two to three years, Cuban Deputy Foreign 
Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Soviet Union, Cuba is building Juragua I and II, both 
440-megawatt nuclear reactors, near the port of Cienfuegos in southern Cuba. 
Testing of the first reactor, originally scheduled for the end of the 1980s, 
has now been postponed until the end of 1992 at the earliest. The reason for 
the delay was not specified. Cuban officials say their nuclear program is aimed 
at reducing the Communist island nation's dependence on oil.

SOVIET UNION MIGHT LOSE ITS BEST PLAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LITHUANIA'S RECENT DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE COULD CHANGE THE 
PICTURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the living room wall of Alexander Gomelsky's apartment is a large color 
photograph of him being tossed into the air by his players after he coached the 
Soviet Union's basketball team to the championship at the 1988 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting with outstretched arms to catch him, along with other members of the 
team, are four Lithuanians, including perhaps the best players the Soviets have 
ever had -- center Arvydas Sabonis and guard Sarunas Marciulionis. 
</P>
<P>
The picture for basketball in his country, Gomelsky admitted, would be much 
different without Lithuania, a Baltic state of 3.7 million people that declared 
its independence on March 13 from the other 14 republics within the Soviet 
Union. Although the Soviet government has ruled that action invalid, Lithuania 
has proceeded toward independence in virtually every area of life, including 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep a team that won the gold medal in Seoul after upsetting 
the United States in the semifinals together for as long as possible, Gomelsky, 
promoted last year to chairman of the Soviet basketball federation, will meet 
here today with the president of Lithuania's Olympic Committee, Arturas 
Povilionas. 
</P>
<P>
Gomelsky said last week he will ask Povilionas to give his blessing to 
Lithuanians who want to play for the Soviet Union this summer at the Goodwill 
Games in Seattle and the World Championships in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Povilionas does not have to approve in order for the players to compete for the 
Soviets because Lithuania is not recognized as an independent country by any 
international sports governing body, including basketball's, but Gomelsky said 
it would be easier for all involved if he did. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Povilionas expected to respond negatively, it is not clear whether 
the Lithuanians want to play for the Soviets. The only player who has responded 
publicly, Sabonis, said he would play only for Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
One member of Lithuania's Olympic Committee, Arvydas Guorzaietis, said Saturday 
that some basketball players, as well as athletes in other sports that have 
major international competitions this year, might decide otherwise if they 
receive money to play by Soviet sports officials. But he warned that they will 
suffer consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"All who do that will not play for Lithuania in the future," he said. "The 
public mood is angry against Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, Soviet officials criticized the Lithuanian Olympic 
Committee for placing athletes under that sort of pressure and said political 
leaders in Lithuania are using sports to further their nationalistic cause. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980 and '84, athletes became hostages of the politicians who used sports 
to achieve political goals," said Nikolai Rusak, chairman of the Soviet sports 
federation, Goskomsport. "As a result, U.S. and Soviet athletes did not compete 
against each other (in the Summer Olympics) for more than 10 years. Now, 
looking back, both countries are very sorry for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the Lithuanian Olympic Committee is beginning to make the same mistakes 
we made before. Sports should not be used to separate people. It should be used 
to bring them together. 
</P>
<P>
"But the officials there have taken this position whether or not it coincides 
with the feelings of the athletes and coaches in Lithuania. I have had a lot of 
telephone calls from them. They say they are ready to compete for the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
In the only test so far, a Lithuanian cross-country skier won an international 
championship last week for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Soviet officials are most concerned about the decisions of the basketball 
players, who form the nucleus of the national team. Unlike other republics such 
as Russia, the Ukraine and Georgia, where soccer is the most popular sport, the 
Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- traditionally have favored 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In the years immediately preceding World War II, when the Baltic states were 
independent, Lithuania was considered a basketball power, once winning the 
European championship. But it earned no concessions from its neighbor, Latvia, 
which once protested so vehemently over its rival's use of a tall American of 
Lithuanian descent in the pivot that the two countries temporarily broke off 
diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball historians here say that Baltic natives who lived for a period in 
the United States took the sport with them when they returned home. One reason 
it has flourished there more than in other republics in recent years is because 
the Baltic states were able to pirate telecasts of NBA games from Finland. 
</P>
<P>
When the Atlanta Hawks made a three-game tour of the Soviet Union in 1988, more 
than 1 million fans requested tickets for the game in the Lithuanian capital of 
Vilnius. A sellout crowd of 16,000 bought tickets there for the team's 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven Soviets playing basketball professionally in other countries, 
including Marciulionis with the Golden State Warriors, five are from Lithuania. 
Gomelsky said two young Lithuanians, who are playing at home, are contenders 
for the national team. The new coach, Valdas Garastas, also is from Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
He has a four-year contract that will expire after the 1992 Summer Olympics in 
Barcelona. Gomelsky said he recently met with Garastas and expects him to 
fulfill the terms of the contract, but there is pressure on the coach in 
Lithuania to resign. 
</P>
<P>
All three Baltic states had independent national Olympic committees in the 
1920s and '30s, competing in the Olympic Games as separate nations from 1924 
through 1936. Estonia and Latvia even had members on the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC). 
</P>
<P>
When the states were annexed by the Soviet Union in a 1940 pact between Stalin 
and Hitler, they lost their independence. Even the Soviet government 
acknowledges that the annexation was illegal, but their paths to independence 
remains filled with obstacles. Likewise, their national Olympic committees, all 
three of which were re-established within a two-month period in late 1988 and 
early '89, have not been recognized either by the Soviets or the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three Olympic committees visited the IOC late last year 
but were told that they could not be considered for membership until they were 
associated with five international sports federations. 
</P>
<P>
But the federations, as well as the IOC, are reluctant to act without approval 
from one of their most influential members, the Soviet Union. The executive 
board of the Soviet Olympic Committee is meeting Thursday to set a date for a 
special Congress that will determine whether Lithuania's Olympic Committee 
should be independent. Anticipating defeat, Lithuanian sports officials will 
attend the Congress only as observers because they do not want to acknowledge 
that the Soviets maintain control over them. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lithuanian teams, including strong basketball entries from Vilnius 
and Kaunas, have withdrawn from Soviet leagues. That followed a similar action 
by soccer teams in Georgia, which also has an active independence movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have told both the Georgians and the Lithuanians that if their athletes miss 
even half a year of competition in the Soviet leagues, their progress is going 
to be set back five years," Rusak said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians are considering contingency plans, including the establishment 
of leagues that might involve teams from other countries as well as the other 
Baltic states and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
They also are negotiating for a presence in the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion will be so strong in our favor that concessions will be made," 
Guorzaietis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodwill Games officials also have to consider their relationship with the 
Soviets, without whom there would be no Goodwill Games. A spokesman for the 
U.S. Lithuanian community, Valdas Adamkas, recently met with Games President 
Bob Walsh and suggested a compromise that would allow Lithuanian athletes to 
compete under their own flag but not for medals.

UC IRVINE'S DANIEL ALDRICH JR. DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., founding chancellor of UC Irvine and the only person in 
the University of California's history to head three of the system's campuses, 
died this morning at UCI Medical Center after a long battle with cancer. He was 
71. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich, an athletic man with a strong, resonant voice, built UCI literally 
from the ground up, having picked the site for the campus in December, 1961. He 
is credited with making that new campus, which now has 16,000 students, one of 
the nation's premier research institutions by the time he retired 22 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to heading the Irvine campus from its planning phases in 1962 to 
his retirement in 1984, Aldrich served as interim chancellor of UC Riverside in 
1984-85 and interim chancellor of UC Santa Barbara in 1986-87 when the campus 
was struggling to recover from a financial scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich's 22-year tenure as head of UC Irvine is the longest of any chancellor 
in the nine-campus University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
UC President David P. Gardner, borrowing a baseball term, had often called 
Aldrich his "utility chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner also had praised Aldrich for "unimpeachable integrity" and for the 
"courage and dignity" with which Aldrich faced his battle against intestinal 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents, in a formal resolution in 1985, praised Aldrich as "an 
institution in himself, a man whose values are as rock-ribbed and solid as the 
hills of his native New England." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services have not been immediately announced. Survivors include his 
wife, Jean; three grown children, Daniel G. III, Elizabeth and Stuart, and 
seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich's death followed a 3-year fight against intestinal cancer. When the 
ailment was diagnosed in May, 1987, Aldrich, a fierce, lifelong sports 
competitor who stood 6 feet, 4 inches tall, said he did not intend to slow his 
active lifestyle. "One goes on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Aldrich retired in 1984, UC Irvine had emerged from being a little-known, 
fledgling campus to a nationally known institution honored for its research. 
</P>
<P>
Campus historians have said that Aldrich's task in building a new campus was 
complicated by the turbulent 1960s -- a time of national unrest on college 
campuses because of the Vietnam War. At one point in the late 1960s, some 
students occupied a building on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"My position was that as long as they were not being destructive or disrupting 
classes, so be it," Aldrich recalled later. He said he was low-key about the 
incident and sought to avoid a campus police-student confrontation. After three 
days, Aldrich sent the protesters occupying the building a note, saying they 
would soon be in the official position of being disruptive and should disband. 
With no fanfare, the protesters dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Orange County -- and historians have noted that the county was 
considerably more strait-laced in the 1960s than today -- sometimes looked 
aghast at liberal activities on the new UCI campus. Aldrich said he was able to 
keep peace between community and campus because he had no trouble in 
identifying with Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I identified with these people," he said. "It didn't even strike me that 
I was coming into a conservative county. I fit in."

Attorneys seated a jury dominated by churchgoers today to hear federal charges 
against PTL pastor Sam Johnson, who is accused of lying to the grand jury that 
indicted ministry founder Jim Bakker in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The government asserts that Johnson perjured himself when he told the grand 
jury that he could not remember where he got $10,000 that served as the initial 
"hush money" payment to Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with Bakker led to 
the evangelist's fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Max Cogburn said: "He did remember the promise to get the 
money, and he did remember where he got the money. We expect the evidence to 
show Sam Johnson had in his possession thousands and thousands of dollars 
entrusted to him from mission work and that he used that money." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Johnson will be the fifth person to go to prison in the PTL 
television ministry scandal. He could be sentenced to 60 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was seated in 90 minutes. All but one of the jurors said they attend 
church, but most had no prior knowledge of Johnson. None had ever donated to a 
television ministry.

PERES SEES WANE OF PALESTINIAN UPRISING

Labor Party leader Shimon Peres predicted today that the 28-month-old 
Palestinian uprising will wane once his party leads the government into a 
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Peres also predicted that the Soviet Union will upgrade ties with Israel and 
allow direct Moscow-Tel Aviv flights to speed up Jewish emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Peres' comments appeared in two Hebrew-language newspapers as Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud Party was making intensive last-ditch 
efforts to block his road to power. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir was wooing defectors in advance of a Wednesday parliamentary vote on 
Peres' confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Peres told the Al Hamishmar daily that once his government is installed, Israel 
will approve proposals by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for an 
Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Peres' support for Baker's ideas toppled the Labor-Likud coalition government 
March 15, when Shamir lost a vote of confidence in the Parliament. He had 
refused to agree to the U.S. proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's plan was aimed at bridging differences between Israel and the PLO over 
an Israeli proposal to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The 1.7 million Palestinians would choose representatives to negotiate an 
interim agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Peres told the mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot, "I estimate that the intifada 
(uprising) will . . . wane and that millions of shekels in the state budget can 
be diverted to constructive tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"I can already foresee the fruits of opening peace negotiations," he added. 
"Relations will be renewed with the Soviet Union . . . in a matter of weeks." 
The Kremlin broke ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising has resulted in the death of 673 Palestinians from Israeli gunfire 
and 43 Israeli deaths as a result of Arab violence. 
</P>
<P>
Peres indicated that he plans no change in Israel's policy of refusing to speak 
to the Palestine Liberation Organization but he appeared to leave room for some 
indirect PLO involvement in the negotiations.

A land mine hidden in a culvert exploded under a military vehicle today, 
killing four soldiers and injuring a civilian near this southeastern town, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement issued to news 
media in the British province. 
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said the bomb hurled the heavy Land Rover into the air and 
left behind a crater in the road about 40 feet wide and 15 feet deep. Shattered 
pieces of the vehicle were scattered over the nearby countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred just before 8 a.m. near the Downpatrick race course in 
County Down, in the southeast part of the province. The area was quickly sealed 
off, and police and soldiers were airlifted in to search for clues. 
</P>
<P>
A civilian in a passing car suffered cuts and bruises, a spokesman for the 
Royal Ulster Constabulary said. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were members of the Ulster Defense Regiment, the mainly 
Protestant, locally recruited regiment of the British army, said the spokesman, 
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths bring to 16 killed in political and sectarian violence in Northern 
Ireland so far this year.

Tens of thousands of Soviet Georgians rallied in Tbilisi today on the 
anniversary of the slaying of 19 pro-independence protesters by Soviet forces, 
and burned the region's military chief in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
There was a partial re-enactment of last year's 4 a.m. assault, when troops 
armed with shotguns, shovels and toxic gas charged onto Rustaveli Boulevard in 
the Georgian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations broadcast the sound of rumbling tanks and ringing bells. 
</P>
<P>
From midnight Sunday through early today, people carrying flowers and candles 
thronged the boulevard. About 100,000 Georgians stood with raised fists for a 
silent moment to honor the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Later, demonstrators burned an effigy of Col. Gen. I. N. Rodionov, regional 
military commander, in front of the city's Government House, which overlooks 
the broad square where Soviet troops moved in. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people died in the clash a year ago, and another was killed by troops 
in a separate incident. Thousands suffered ailments from the gas. 
</P>
<P>
The assault caused a nationwide furor, raised doubts about President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's proclaimed policy of not using troops to stifle dissent and brought 
many Georgians into the battle for independence. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial protest Sunday and today had more an air of defiance than of 
mourning. Most speakers spoke of the impetus the deaths gave the republic's 
burgeoning independence movement.

KENNEDY TO DEMOCRATS: 'REGAIN SOUL'; 
</P>
<P>
SPENDING PRIORITIES: SENATOR URGES PARTY TO SUPPORT DEFENSE CUTS TO PAY FOR 
DOMESTIC PROGRAMS.

<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called today for the Democratic Party to 
regain its soul by backing a five-year, 27% cut in defense spending with the 
money to pay for a wide range of performance-tested domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, one of the most liberal voices of the party, conceded that having lost 
five of the past six national elections, Democrats are adrift and in danger of 
losing all power unless the party reinvigorates itself and rediscovers its 
liberal principles. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Georgetown University, Kennedy argued that a possible "peace 
dividend" from lessening Cold War tensions could give Democrats a unique 
opportunity to re-establish themselves by pushing for new domestic programs 
without having to ask for many new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the programs he outlined were national health insurance, which he has 
championed for years, a drastic expansion of the Head Start education program, 
a restructuring of the nation's school system and a plan to use defense 
industries to improve the country's transportation and communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party can never regain the presidency, or ultimately keep its 
congressional power, by disguising or repudiating our own basic identity," 
Kennedy said. "We are, both by history and belief, the carriers of principles 
and ideas best described as progressive, liberal, activist, concerned and 
ambitious for our country." 
</P>
<P>
"If as Democrats we continue to drift -- if we run from our values and our 
enduring beliefs, we can be certain that the voters will not follow us," 
Kennedy said, arguing that the party's central problem "is the temptation to 
retreat from the very reasons we are Democrats, the very ground of our party's 
being." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy complained that with the President enjoying extraordinarily high 
popularity ratings, Democrats are giving too much ground and "almost conceding 
a second term to President Bush -- or hoping against hope that he stumbles 
somewhere along the way." 
</P>
<P>
To regain the initiative, Kennedy suggested that the dramatic new push for 
domestic programs be paid by military cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"This would free a minimum of $170 billion for other uses and it would still 
leave defense spending at the same level as in the post-Korea and post-Vietnam 
periods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The money, Kennedy argued, should not go to cutting the federal deficit, but 
should be placed in what he called a "National Needs Trust Fund" and then doled 
out to domestic programs proven to work. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy conceded that in the past Democrats have too often supported programs 
that, while conceived with the best of intentions, were not effective.

to Korea as "a satchel man" with $100,000 in cash for the Philippines first 
lady. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Carino, 60, said Marcos took $14,000 of it and handed it out to generals' 
wives for expenses at the funeral of South Korean President Park Chung Hee. 
</P>
<P>
As Marcos' racketeering and fraud trial began its second week, Carino described 
how he flew to Seoul with the money to meet the Marcos' funeral entourage after 
Park was assassinated in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"You went to Korea on the orders of Mrs. Marcos' secretary?" defense lawyer 
Gerry Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they were referring to me as a satchel man," Carino replied. 
</P>
<P>
"A bagman?" Spence asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I carried it close to my legs," Carino answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Your legs?" Spence asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course. $100,000 is a lot of money," Carino snapped back.

A State Department plane used to spray opium poppies in northwestern Guatemala 
slammed into a mountainside, killing the pilot and injuring the co-pilot, both 
of them Americans, an embassy spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
He said the spray program would be suspended until investigators determine the 
cause of the crash, which may have been engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He said the pilot radioed air traffic controllers in Guatemala City "minutes, 
if not seconds" before the crash reporting engine difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed early Sunday, 10 miles east of the capital, on return from a 
training mission in the opium-infested Cuilco Valley, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, David Webster Corey, died instantly in the crash, the embassy said. 
The co-pilot, James Maxwell, was reported in guarded but stable condition today 
at a hospital in the United States.

Grumman, the U.S. aerospace company that is a leader in the business of linking 
supercomputers in large-scale networks, said today that it has started talks 
with Japanese supercomputer makers to bring the powerful Japanese machines to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"We see Japanese machines successfully entering the U.S. market in the next few 
years," said Curtis Orchard, vice president of Grumman International. 
</P>
<P>
Political opposition previously blocked nearly all sales in the United States 
of Japanese supercomputers, the powerful computers used mainly in large-scale 
research projects to design weapons, aircraft, cars and other products and to 
predict weather patterns, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
The supercomputers, the largest of which cost $30 million, are at least 3,500 
times faster than the mainframe computers used by most businesses. The machines 
are considered vital for keeping a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
Under intense pressure from Washington, Tokyo agreed late in March to open its 
public market to American-made supercomputers as part of talks aimed at easing 
trade tensions between the two economic superpowers.

Moscow and its reformist allies, in a move unthinkable only months ago, have 
accepted an international accord committing them to back private property, free 
enterprise and multi-party democracy, delegates to an East-West economic 
conference said today. 
</P>
<P>
Although not legally binding, it represents a formal commitment by the 
reformist Communist countries to step further down the path of Western-style 
free markets and make their currencies convertible. 
</P>
<P>
The pledges are contained in a draft final document agreed upon by 35 nations 
attending a Conference on Economic Cooperation in Europe, which has been 
meeting here since March. 
</P>
<P>
The document, submitted by six neutral countries today, was based largely on 
proposals from the European Community, Canada and the United States.

Ford Motor Co. said today that it is recalling about 101,000 Aerostar vans from 
the 1986-model year to replace seals between the fuel tank and filler pipe. The 
recall involves vans made between November, 1985, and May, 1986, Ford said, 
adding that it had received an unspecified number of complaints of fuel leakage 
and gasoline odors in those models and that a potential for fuel leakage occurs 
when the tank is full or nearly full.

ALLSTATE INSURANCE FILES SUIT AGAINST NEW JERSEY REGULATIONS

Allstate Insurance Co. filed its long-promised lawsuit against New Jersey's new 
car insurance law in federal court today, claiming that the plan to lower rates 
is unconstitutional because it takes away insurance company profits without due 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"This law is an unfair and unconstitutional effort to avoid facing up to the 
real problems of auto insurance in New Jersey by punishing Allstate and other 
insurers," Allstate attorney Floyd Abrams said after the suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
"Filing this suit is in the best interests of Allstate's customers, 
shareholders and New Jersey employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Newark, attacks a portion of the law 
that requires insurance companies to pay off $1.4 billion of the $3-billion 
debt of the Joint Underwriting Assn., New Jersey's financially troubled pool 
for high-risk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies would not be allowed to pass the expense on to customers, 
and those who object would not be permitted to stop writing auto policies in 
New Jersey unless they also abandon their other insurance business in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
That amounts to a seizure of insurance company property -- insurance profits -- 
without due process, and is a violation of the Constitution, the company 
argued. The action also "deprives Allstate of its right to make a fair and 
reasonable return on its business," the suit claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff of the JUA debt is the key to eliminating the $222 annual surcharge 
all insured motorists in New Jersey pay to subsidize the pool.

NINJA TURTLES SHELL-SHOCK HOLLYWOOD;

MOVIES: RADIOACTIVE REPTILES SNAP UP $19 MILLION IN TICKETS DURING SECOND WEEK

<P>
Those radioactive reptiles did it again! 
</P>
<P>
New Line Cinema's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" snapped up about $19 million 
in ticket sales during their second week at the box office -- leaving Hollywood 
shell-shocked. 
</P>
<P>
With many youngsters across the country now on spring break, the man-size, 
pizza-crazy critters -- who were spawned by a 1984 comic book -- are expected 
to continue their assault. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with box-office grosses of nearly $45 million, the Turtles are now on 
the verge of axing Freddy Krueger. Prior to the release of the "Turtles," New 
Line's top grosser was the fourth film in the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" 
series -- starring the irascible Freddy. It scared up $50 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Turtles" is also expected to easily wax another record and emerge as the 
top-grossing independently released film. The honor now goes to Vestron's 
"Dirty Dancing," which earned $54 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Turtlemania wasn't the only big news at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone's "Pretty Woman" -- starring Richard Gere as a corporate executive 
who falls in love with Hollywood hooker-turned-lady Julia Roberts -- earned 
about $11 million for yet another week in the No. 2 spot. This brings receipts 
for the R-rated Pygmalionish comedy-romance to about $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 was Touchstone's third installment in the film series about dumb-guy hero 
Ernest P. Worrell, as played by Jim Varney. "Ernest Goes to Jail" locked up 
strong receipts of an estimated $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The news was also good for Orion Pictures. Its supernatural thriller, "The 
First Power," saw receipts of nearly $5.8 million materialize, for fourth 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth place went to Paramount Pictures' still-formidable "The Hunt for Red 
October," which torpedoed about $5 million in ticket sales. The submarine 
thriller has now commanded grosses of more than $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among the weekend disappointments were several new releases, including 
Tri-Star's "I Love You to Death," which boasted an all-star cast and direction 
by Lawrence Kasdan, but managed to take in about $3.8 million, for sixth place. 
And Universal's "Cry Baby," starring heartthrob Johnny Debb, with direction by 
cult king John Waters, did about $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
In limited release at 155 screens, the Warner Bros.' thriller "Impulse" had 
receipts of about $535,000. Meanwhile, Universal's "Opportunity Knocks," 
starring Dana Carvey of "Saturday Night Live," plummeted an estimated 39%, its 
second week, for receipts of about $2.2 million.

Gospel-pop singer Amy Grant is suing Marvel Comics to stop the use of what she 
says is her likeness on a comic book that features "occult subject matter." 
</P>
<P>
She charges that a photograph from her 1986 album, "Amy Grant -- the 
Collection," was copied for the cover of the March 15 issue of "Dr. Strange 
Sorcerer Supreme." 
</P>
<P>
She filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see it's the spitting image," said her attorney, Mark Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said he'll ask for an injunction to stop distribution of that issue 
and will probably seek monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit charges that "Dr. Strange" features characters, story lines and 
artwork related to witchcraft, sorcery, science fiction and other fantasy, 
horror and occult subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Many fans of Christian music consider interest in witchcraft and the occult to 
be antithetical to their Christian beliefs and to the message of Christian 
music in general," the lawsuit said.

Flutist James Galway's eyes sparkle at the mention of his operatic debut in the 
title role of Rossini's "The Thieving Magpie" in its first U.S. performance in 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't study birds for years to do this. 
</P>
<P>
I studied music," said Galway, 50, who is basing his stage movements on his 
observation of the chattering, black and white bird. 
</P>
<P>
Rossini wrote the opera using an actor as the magpie who stole the silver spoon 
and caused a young servant girl to be sentenced to death, but the Opera Company 
of Philadelphia revised the role for a musician. 
</P>
<P>
The rolling notes Galway plays as he flits about the stage were borrowed from 
passages Rossini wrote for the violin and flute as parts of the orchestra down 
in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
Galway, who turned 50 last year, will play opening night, April 16, and his 
wife and fellow performer, Jeanne, will play the magpie in the second and final 
performance. On April 17, Galway begins a tour in Southern California that ends 
three weeks later in New York City.

A capacity crowd at Boston's Fenway Park cheered today as Red Sox pitcher Roger 
Clemens fired the first pitch of the 1990 baseball season, which began a week 
late because the owners and players were embroiled in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
No bitterness was evident in the stands, where fans seemed to take a 
better-late-than-never attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"People forgive them," said one Boston fan, William Cullen of Cherry Valley, 
Mass. "We're Americans. You love a thing, you're going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Toni Giamatti, widow of the late Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti, threw out 
the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway, where the Red Sox faced the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Giamatti's successor as commissioner, Fay Vincent, threw 
out the ball at New York's Shea Stadium before the Mets took on the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden followed with the first real pitch of the 
game -- and, like Clemens, he threw a strike. 
</P>
<P>
There was no game in Cincinnati, marking just the third time since 1876 that 
the Reds have opened on the road. Because of the revised schedules, the Reds

Cincinnati's Tom Browning said. "The crowd's not going to be part of the 
hoopla." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, the Cubs and White Sox were each home today. The White Sox, 
starting their last season at Comiskey Park, played Milwaukee, and the Cubs are 
to face Philadelphia in the first night opener at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, trying to become the first World Series winner to repeat 
since the New York Yankees in 1977-78, open at home tonight against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
To make it to the World Series, the Athletics will have to win their third 
straight American League West title and hold off California and Kansas City, 
two teams that improved through free agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels signed Mark Langston and the Royals got National League Cy Young 
winner Mark Davis along with Storm Davis, a 19-game winner for Oakland last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems the way those two teams have improved that it's going to take a 
lot of wins to finish first," Oakland manager Tony La Russa said. "What we 
really stress is taking care of our business. If I had to pick one club to deal 
with, it would be this one." 
</P>
<P>
In other AL openers, Baltimore was at Kansas City this afternoon and Seattle is 
to play the Angels tonight. In the NL, San Diego played at Los Angeles during 
the day and Montreal is at St. Louis tonight. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of players are starting the season in new places. Joe Carter is in San 
Diego after being traded for Sandy Alomar Jr., Carlos Baerga and Chris James. 
The New York Mets sent Randy Myers to Cincinnati for John Franco in a swap of 
relievers, and the Mets dealt Juan Samuel to Los Angeles for Mike Marshall and 
Alejandro Pena. 
</P>
<P>
Free agency also reshaped rosters and the salary structure, increasing the 
average pay to nearly $600,000. Kevin Bass is in San Francisco, Pete O'Brien is 
in Seattle, Dave Parker in Milwaukee, Pascual Perez with the Yankees, Oil Can 
Boyd in Montreal, Craig Lefferts in San Diego, Hubie Brooks in Los Angeles, and 
two old Mets have moved -- Keith Hernandez to Cleveland and Gary Carter to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Some players are returning from long absences. Dave Winfield is with the New 
York Yankees after missing last season with back problems. Pitcher Greg Mathews 
is with St. Louis after missing last year with elbow trouble. Mike Norris, a 
22-game winner with Oakland in 1980, is again with the Athletics, making a 
comeback at age 35 after physical and drug problems forced him out of the major 
leagues in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Some players won't be on the field on opening day. Paul Molitor, Kirk Gibson, 
Todd Worrell, Rick Sutcliffe and touted rookie Ben McDonald of Baltimore are 
among those on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Others won't be anywhere. Darrell Evans, with 414 career home runs, was 
released by Atlanta in spring training. Joaquin Andujar, who hoped a strong 
showing in the senior league would help his comeback, was cut by Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar, Todd Zeile of St. Louis, John Olerud of Toronto and Marquis Grissom of 
Montreal are rookies likely to make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
Some familiar faces are back, too. Nolan Ryan starts tonight for Texas at home 
against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 43, needs 11 victories to reach 300. He won 16 last season for the 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some records I don't care that much about, but I do want to win 300 
games," Ryan said. "It's probably the only time I've ever gone into a season 
shooting at a statistic." 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto at Texas game is one of those rescheduled because of the lockout. 
On Tuesday, the two teams will play as previously scheduled, this time in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will toss out the 
first balls at the SkyDome when the Rangers, owned by Bush's son, travel to 
play the Blue Jays.

Jim Valvano's departure as coach leaves North Carolina State with the twofold 
task of finding a new athletic director and rebuilding its men's basketball 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very critical and difficult time for us," said William Burns Jr., 
co-vice chairman of the N.C. State Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the university is strong enough. I don't see any problem getting 
good people to fill these positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the new coach would be a man of high principle, one who 
believes in working with young men and encouraging their development and at the 
same time winning some games." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters and officials at N.C. State echoed the optimism Valvano displayed 
Saturday after he agreed to leave and not sue the school in exchange for 
$238,000. Valvano also stands to be paid $375,000 by the university's booster 
club, one of Valvano's attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano had been under pressure to resign since reports in February that former 
players accepted cash and shaved points. Valvano never was implicated. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the rebuilding process, some say, has been left in the hands of Charlie 
Bryant, executive secretary of the Wolfpack Club.

Denver Broncos running back Bobby Humphrey today pleaded guilty to driving 
while impaired and speeding. He was fined $508 and ordered to perform 24 hours 
of public service. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey had been charged with the more serious offense of driving while under 
the influence of alcohol, but he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge and to 
speeding 34 m.p.h. in a 30-m.p.h. zone as part of a plea-bargain agreement. His 
jury trial on the DUI charge had been scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides imposing the fine, Arapahoe County Judge Alan R. Beckman sentenced 
Humphrey to 180 days in jail but suspended the jail term on the condition that 
the player successfully complete nine months of probation and other conditions 
of his sentence.

VINCENT THROWS OPENING DAY PITCH

<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent threw out the ceremonial first ball today at Shea 
Stadium in New York for the Opening Day game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, one of the driving forces behind the settlement of the contract 
dispute that delayed the season openers for a week, arrived about two hours 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited," Vincent said. "What a day. I'm a fan, and being someone 
involved in the game makes it even more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent watched the game from a box just to the left of the Mets' dugout and 
threw out the first pitch to backup catcher Mackey Sasser, who was surrounded 
by about 50 photographers. 
</P>
<P>
The game started under sunny skies and a temperature of 59 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"When the weather is not good I get blamed, so I'll take credit for the good 
weather," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:48 p.m. EDT, Howard Johnson of the New York Mets hit the first home run of 
the season. Johnson hit his solo home run in the bottom of the first against 
Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek. The sellout crowd at Shea Stadium gave Johnson a 
standing ovation, and he responded with the season's first curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Winters, a minor-league umpire for seven years, was named today to the 
National League's umpiring crew. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Winters will open the season in the Pacific Coast League and 
join the National League when umpire vacations begin. Winters replaces the 
retired John Kibler. 
</P>
<P>
Winters worked in the PCL the last four seasons with earlier stints in the 
Texas League, the California League and the Arizona Instructional League. He 
called several NL games as a vacation relief umpire last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles prepared to begin the season today without their hottest 
pitching prospect, Ben McDonald, who has been put on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles also placed pitcher Mark Williamson and infielder Tim Hulett on the 
21-day disabled list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, baseball's No. 1 draft choice last June, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list retroactive to last Friday and will be able to pitch April 22. 
Williamson went on the list retroactive to March 31 and will be eligible to 
pitch April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Hulett is expected to be sidelined about six weeks after surgery on his left 
hand Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take any chances with anybody," manager Frank Robinson said. 
"Especially with young guys who may not know what's good for them. We're not 
thinking about the present. We're thinking about the future, too."

BETTING THE SYSTEMS; 
</P>
<P>
CRAZY ANNIE IS NUTS FOR THE HANDICAPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her friends at Santa Anita Park call her "Crazy Annie" because she looks as if 
she were more suited for the homeless colony in downtown Los Angeles than for 
the Club House, where she always sits in the same reserved seat every day of 
the race season. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Annie has long, stringy, gray hair that she never combs, walks with a 
cane, which she sometimes uses as a threat to people who get in her path on the 
way to the betting windows, talks loudly to herself and afterward glares at 
certain people around her as if they had said something reprehensible. She 
wears the same black dress every day and old, torn tennis shoes and carries 
whatever belongings she has, including her money, in a shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
What intrigues her friends is that she has the funds to bet every race, day in 
and day out through the season. Actually, although Crazy Annie doesn't look it, 
she is a wealthy woman. 
</P>
<P>
In her youth, she was a part-time actress, married a businessman who piled up a 
fortune in real estate and office buildings along Wilshire Boulevard, and she 
received a huge settlement after a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Annie isn't as crazy as she seems. Since she isn't a handicapper and has 
no patience with the Racing Form, she assumes that someone else should pick the 
horses for her. And that someone, she reasons, should be the handicapper who is 
getting paid for making such selections in her local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Herald-Examiner folded, she had been following Bob Mieszerski. When 
Mieszerski moved to the Los Angeles Times, she continued to follow his 
selections, betting $5 to win a race, no matter what the odds were on the 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
On March 14, 1990, Crazy Annie's nag, Highland Mint, came in third in the first 
race. Hollywood Reporter ran out of the money in the second and Maid O Gold 
lost the third. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a streak of four consecutive winners. In the fourth race, Mieszerski 
chose Business Prospect, which turned out to be the favorite at $1.60 to $1. 
</P>
<P>
Business Prospect broke from the No. 11 post position and raced into second 
place behind the leader. The nag then charged to the front by two lengths at 
the quarter-pole. At the finish, Business Prospect won by six lengths. Crazy 
Annie picked up $13 for her $5 bet. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth race, about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf for 3-year-old fillies, the 
lineup and odds to $1 was as follows: 
</P>
<P>
1. Nu Myoozik, 35.90 
</P>
<P>
2. Icy Folly, 18.30 
</P>
<P>
3. Phil's Illusion, 17.70 
</P>
<P>
4. Effusive Bounty, 11.50 
</P>
<P>
5. Nijinsky's Lover, 4.30 
</P>
<P>
6. Somethingmerry, 7.40 
</P>
<P>
7. Saros Treasure, 16.30 
</P>
<P>
8. Forest Fealty, 4.40 
</P>
<P>
9. I Canon I Will, 35.20 
</P>
<P>
10. Wakia, 10.60 
</P>
<P>
11. Brought To Mind, 2.20 
</P>
<P>
The favorite in the race was Brought To Mind, but Mieszerski's choice was 
Somethingmerry at $7.40 to $1. At the start, Somethingmerry tucked into fifth 
and continued in that spot until the stretch, when it moved up to fourth. Then 
Somethingmerry shifted into high gear and made a big rush down the stretch to 
win by two lengths and pay $42 for $5. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth race, six furlongs for 3-year-old maidens, Crazy Annie bet on 
Itsthefax, which went off the favorite in the race at $1.30 to $1. Itsthefax 
started out in the outside post position of a 12-horse field but immediately 
took the lead as the gate opened. At the quarter-pole the nag was running 
easily 1 1/2 lengths in front. It ended up a winner by five lengths, going 
wire-to-wire and paying $11.50 for $5. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh race saw another favorite win for Crazy Annie. Kimo's Kid, 
Mieszerski's best bet of the day, was entered in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance 
sprint for 4-year-olds and up. Kimo's Kid was first by a head at the 
quarter-pole, increased its lead to 1 1/2 lengths by the stretch, then tired 
but held on to win by a head. It paid $13 for a $5 wager. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth race, Crazy Annie ended up third with Devil's Orchid and ran out 
of the money in the ninth with Free Living. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, Crazy Annie had invested $45 for the nine races. Returns amounted 
to $79.50, and her profit turned out to be a nifty $34.50. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, March 15, also was a winning day for Crazy Annie, inasmuch as 
Mieszerski repeated with four winners. Rash Decision, running in the second 
race with 3-year-old fillies at 1 1/16 miles, took the lead at the quarter-pole 
by a head. It faded back to second until the stretch, where it made another 
move and took over the No. 1 position by 2 1/2 lengths. At the finish, Rash 
Decision won by 1 1/4 lengths. Backers received $17 for every $5 bet. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite, My Niriko, and Mieszerski's best bet of the day, won the fourth 
race to pay $13 for a $5 wager. Paisano Pete won the fifth with a $17.50 payoff 
and It's All Relative, a heavy favorite, paid $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, Crazy Annie again had wagered $45. Although the day was 
profitable, returns amounted only to $56, for an $11 profit. 
</P>
<P>
What Crazy Annie may tell her cronies is that handicappers generally win or 
lose in streaks. 
</P>
<P>
She has discovered with her system that most handicappers average about 28% 
winners. "When they're hot, they're good," she says, "but when they're cold, 
they're awful." 
</P>
<P>
No one has to strictly follow a handicapper. To cut down on losses, the player 
can skip maiden and 2-year-old races. 
</P>
<P>
Even when using the picks made by professional handicappers, there is no way to 
guarantee that a horse that may have won in the past will do so again in the 
future, no matter how many races it runs. However, a nag that has recorded many 
wins and has won a lot of money for its owner is more of a sound investment 
than is the occasional winner.

<P>
ANATOMY OF A PITCH; 
</P>
<P>
HOW SPIN AFFECTS FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, there have been a number of theories on why pitches move the 
way they do. One theory, in fact, contended that pitches don't break at all, 
rather it is an optical illusion. However, researchers have more recently 
concluded that aerodynamics play an integral part as the air, spin, speed and 
direction of the ball from its release point all converge. 
</P>
<P>
The underspin of a fastball (left) forces air downward, causing the ball to 
rise on a wedge of built-up air while the spin helps to roll away air above the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking pitches (right) utilize the same principles to gain sideways and 
downward arc from the forward spin of the ball. The knuckler, which has very 
little rotation, is unpredictable in its movement because it responds to 
fluctuation air conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FASTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Rising fastball, the Koufax specialty. Held across two wide seams (pitches held 
across seams gain rotation and speed). Fairly straight, but rises because of 
velocity and backspin. This is the standard fastball. Movement depends on 
slight variations of grip and delivery. Speed is generated mostly from the 
legs, the whipping motion of the arm, and wrist snap. "I'll take movement over 
velocity," said Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski. "I'll take a guy who 
throws 88 miles per hour with movement over a guy who throws 90, straight. Then 
again, I'd like to work with the guy who throws 90." 
</P>
<P>
Sinking fastball, a la Hershiser. Held with or across the two narrow seams, 
with pressure applied by the index finger. Bites down and away because of 
diagonal overspin created by staying on top of the ball. Can be run up and in 
by change of hand angle. 
</P>
<P>
Cut fastball: Overloading pressure of middle finger forces ball to sail in on 
hitter. A left-hander uses it to pitch in on a right-handed batter, a 
right-hander uses it to pitch in on a left-handed hitter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BREAKING PITCHES 
</P>
<P>
Curve: Speed of the curve can be varied by arm speed and tightness of grip. 
There are also a variety of grips and arm angles that alter the angle at which 
the curve breaks. Almost all are thrown with topspin to create a downward break 
as contrasted to a slider, which breaks across the plate. A straight overhand 
curve of the Koufax variety has a limited strike zone because it generally 
breaks between the waist and knees, producing more swinging strikes than called 
strikes. Typically, curves are about 10 miles per hour slower than a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Slider: The slider is thrown by overloading the middle finger across the narrow 
seams. It is thrown like a football with the arm speed of a fastball, good 
extension and a snap at the end. A Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton specialty, it 
produces the look of a fastball with a sharp break; down and in from a 
right-hander to a left-handed batter; down and away from a right-hander to a 
right-handed batter. Its speed is generally 4 to 5 miles per hour slower than 
the fastball. A curve is generally 10 mph slower than the fastball with a 
bigger arc than the slider. 
</P>
<P>
Changeup: Thrown with the deceptive arm speed of a fastball. There are also 
changeups thrown off the curve. velocity is altered by the grip. There are a 
variety of changeups, including the palmball, three finger and circle change, 
in which the index finger is curled inside the thumb and placed at the side of 
the ball, with the middle, fourth and little fingers on top of the ball. Frank 
Viola, who has one of the best changeups among active pitchers, throws a circle 
change. The changup is used frequently by pitchers behind in the count, when 
the hitter is sitting on the fastball. It is considered an 'out' pitch with the 
goal of catching the hitter off balance and on his front foot, resulting in an 
easy ground ball or pop-up. San Francisco Manager Roger Craig: "Unless you have 
an overpowering fastball like Ryan or the movement of a Hershiser, you've got 
to be able to throw a breaking ball or off-speed pitch when you're behind on 
the count." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPLIT-FINGER 
</P>
<P>
Thrown by placing the ball comfortably in the split between index and middle 
fingers and delivered with a fastball motion. Some can throw it with the same 
velocity of a fastball. For others, it is more of a changeup. Even if straight 
it has the effect of an off-speed pitch since the hitter sees the same motion, 
arm speed and rotation of the fastball, generally without the same velocity, 
which, in turn, can produce a break that is reminiscent of a spitball -- the 
ball, in the vernacular, dropping off a table. Those who dislike the 
split-finger contend that constant use -- like with any other pitch -- seems to 
deprive a pitcher of the velocity needed for his fastball when he needs his 
best velocity in a strikeout situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCREWBALL 
</P>
<P>
The screwball is a breaking pitch that a right-hander can throw effectively to 
a left-handed batter and a left-hander can throw effectively to a right-handed 
batter because in those situations it breaks down and away from the hitter. The 
ball is generally gripped without use of the seams, the thumb underneath and 
the index and middle fingers together on top, the ball resting in the front 
half of those fingers. It is delivered from a three-quarter or overhand motion 
with an inward snap of the arm to create the reverse and off-speed break. It 
had been the bread and butter pitch of Fernando Valenzuela. Among the pitchers 
who throw it effectively, it often replaces the curve. However, it is 
considered one of the most stressful pitches on the arm because of the reverse 
motion and snapping the ball away from your body rather than with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KNUCKLEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Made famous by Hoyt Wilhelm and the Niekro brothers, it is a pitch that can be 
thrown by people without strong arms, but requires extensive training to help 
keep it under some control. The pitch is difficult to hit and just as difficult 
to catch. It is generally held by digging the fingertips into the ball and 
delivered almost with a pushing motion. The movement is inconsistent and speed 
is as slow as 60 mph. On approach to the plate, the ball breaks at different 
points, its movement is lateral and vertical and there is almost no spin on the 
ball. However, like Charlie Hough, most pitchers who throw it successfully have 
built up calluses on their fingertips, which help them dig into the ball 
firmly.

THE REST (3 DAYS) IS HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A guest one day at a baseball game in Cleveland, where he served as resident 
draft horse, Bob Lemon ran into his old teammate, Early Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
During his incumbency as a pitcher, Lemon won 20 or more games seven times. 
Wynn did it five times. 
</P>
<P>
Now the two were seated in the clubhouse after the game, watching the trainer 
march in with two buckets of ice. Wynn said to Lemon: 
</P>
<P>
"Must be some kind of celebration going on." 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," answered Bob. "That's for the delicate arms of the pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
"We used ice for better reasons," whispered Early. 
</P>
<P>
Whitey Herzog, manager of St. Louis, asked idly one time, "I wonder how many 
games Cy Young would have won if they had iced down his arm?" 
</P>
<P>
Deprived of this therapeutic discovery, Cy won only 511, working every third 
day. 
</P>
<P>
This schedule would change for pitchers to every fourth day, eventually 
yielding to every fifth after the Mets won the 1969 world championship with a 
starting rotation of five. 
</P>
<P>
Embarking upon a new season, in which four days of rest for a pitcher still is 
the general rule, baseball isn't urged here to mend its habits. 
</P>
<P>
The point merely is raised whether it is tactically advisable to send a pitcher 
to the post only once in five days? 
</P>
<P>
Will arms fall from their sockets if they are used more frequently? Or is 
baseball producing a generation of neurotics vulnerable to excessive worry? 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Koufax, voted into the Hall of Fame on the first ballot, flamed out 
shortly before his 31st birthday. In his last four years, pitching every fourth 
day, he won, in order, 25, 19, 26 and 27. 
</P>
<P>
Did the four-day rotation do him in? "I see pitching as a crapshoot," he said. 
"There is no telling what will break down an arm. I always have felt, where 
arms are concerned, that the main factor is genetics." 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser thinks it has more to do with mechanics and mental conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"As kids," he says, "we are taught that pitching every fourth day can break us 
down. That's the thinking we take with us to the majors." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a dissenting view, one tendered by the prominent orthopedic 
surgeon, Dr. Frank Jobe, who explained one day: "It is a simple fact that 
pitching is bad for the arm. It tears down tissue, causes swelling and 
calcification and drains the arm of elasticity. It would follow, naturally, 
that pitching every fourth day is tougher on the arm than pitching every 
fifth." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog doesn't hold a medical degree. At school, in fact, he majored in bass 
fishing. But Whitey assures you that the human arm doesn't know the difference 
between three days rest and four days rest -- and the human head knows even 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Substantiating this cerebral gem for us one day, Whitey explained: 
</P>
<P>
"I had as a pitcher Joaquin Andujar, who won 41 games in two years for me. In 
1984, he won 20, pitching every fourth day. He insisted upon working every 
fourth day, screaming that anything less threw him out of rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the next year, we shifted him to every fifth day. I told him the extra 
rest would be good for his feet. He wins 11 of his first 13 starts and finished 
the season with 21 wins." 
</P>
<P>
"And the point you're making?" Whitey is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The point I'm making is, pitchers don't know the difference. The decisions 
should be flexible. If you have four good arms, you work them every fourth day. 
If you have five, you work them every fifth day. But if you have four good 
arms, and one that is nothing, it is stupid to run a five-man rotation, just 
because that custom is what's going around." 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers make a lot of money working maybe 32 to 35 times. Well, you can say 
that guys earn more working only six times; they clutch a guitar at crotch 
level and scream, "I wanna get to know ya." 
</P>
<P>
So while pitching may not be the softest touch in American commerce, it takes 
its place high on the scale, and it is something to recommend to a son-in-law, 
telling you he is trying to find himself.

REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
FROM BEGINNING TO END, '89 WAS A DISASTER FOR DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the 320 pages of the 1990 Dodger media guide, the highlights of 1989 were 
covered in three. So we'll be brief. 
</P>
<P>
The team's defending world championship season began in Cincinnati, with Tim 
Belcher racked for six runs before the end of the third inning in a 6-4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
It ended six months later, in Atlanta, with umpire Bob Engel calling their 
final game because of a lack of interest. Engel canceled the second game of a 
season-ending doubleheader with the last-place Braves, citing rain problems, 
even though the first game had been completed and it had long since stopped 
raining. 
</P>
<P>
In between, the Dodgers won 77 games, lost 83, and spent all but 15 days of the 
summer in fourth place or lower. They finished in fourth, 14 games behind the 
division-winning San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Just for fun, the Giants rubbed it in during a memorable Sept. 20 game in which 
they came back from a 7-0 deficit to win, 8-7, with five runs in the bottom of 
the ninth. That game was also notable in that it was Mike Marshall's last 
official appearance in a Dodger uniform. After diving for a fly ball and 
missing it in that ninth inning, he sat out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 season was the fourth time in the last six years that the Dodgers had 
finished with a losing record. But rarely in one six-month period have they 
lost so much. Not counting Manager Tom Lasorda's celebrated lost weight -- 38 
pounds -- the operative word here is "injury." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers lost the full services of Kirk Gibson, 1988's Most Valuable Player, 
to a knee injury that eventually required surgery. They lost the full services 
of Marshall, because of injuries ranging from his back to a foot. The Dodgers' 
mid-batting order nightmare of Gibson, Eddie Murray and Marshall proved to be 
just that, a nightmare. The three players started together in just 35 of 160 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers lost the full services of outfielder Kal Daniels, acquired with 
infielder Lenny Harris in a mid-season trade with Cincinnati that sent pitcher 
Tim Leary and infielder Mariano Duncan to the Reds. Daniels joined the team 
while still recovering from arthroscopic left knee surgery in May. After 
playing 11 games for the Dodgers, he required a similar operation on the other 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
At one time or another, injuries also cost the Dodgers the services of 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin, infielder/outfielder Franklin Stubbs, outfielders 
Chris Gwynn and Mike Davis, and pitchers Ray Searage, Alejandro Pena and John 
Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Mickey Hatcher. The Dodgers all-purpose player and cheerleader 
was chasing vandals down a street near his Los Angeles area home when he 
injured his hamstring and was sidelined for 15 days. Of the Dodgers' 18 
different uses of the disabled list, that was the most frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the reason for all the injuries was that the Dodgers played too long. 
They averaged 2:46 for their road games, second-longest in the league. They 
also managed to play the two longest games in Los Angeles franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
On June 3 in Houston, they lost to the Astros, 5-4, in a game that took 22 
innings and 7:14. That night game was followed several hours later by a 
13-inning day game that the Astros won, 7-6, meaning the Dodgers had played 35 
innings in one 24-hour period -- for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The other endless journey occurred Aug. 23 in Montreal, when they defeated the 
Expos, 1-0, in a bout that took 22 innings and 6:14. If Rick Dempsey did not 
finally hit a home run out of frustration, they might still be playing that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger marathons, which included a 17-inning, 15-inning, and two 13-inning 
games, could be explained in the 1989 team's two most prominent traits. The 
Dodger pitchers wouldn't allow anybody to score, while the offense couldn't 
score off anybody. 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers led the National League in earned-run average at 2.95, and 
shutouts with 19, and complete games with 25. Tim Belcher led all major league 
pitchers with eight shutouts. Orel Hershiser finished with a 2.31 ERA, second 
in the NL. Jay Howell recorded a club-record 28 saves. 
</P>
<P>
The hitters, on the other hand, were terrible. The team batting average of .240 
ranked 10th in the 12-team league. The Dodgers led the league with 1,171 
runners left on base. The offense was shut out 17 times, another league high. 
</P>
<P>
The season can be best summed up in the experience of Dave Hansen, a minor 
league third baseman. On Aug. 20, he was recalled to the Dodgers from double-A 
San Antonio. He flew all night to join the team in Montreal. In the left-handed 
hitter's debut game hours after his arrival, Montreal started left-handed 
pitcher Mark Langston, so Hansen did not play. The next morning, Hansen was 
sent back down to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was there, but he wasn't. Like the Dodgers in 1989.

<P>
1, as in No. 1, something they've never been. 
</P>
<P>
2, pitches. One to Cecil Cooper, one to Dave Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
3. Gene Mauch. The Little General managed three craggy, cranky Angel teams to 
90-win seasons, won two division championships and wringed more out of the 
talent at hand than any of his predecessors. He deserves to be remembered for 
more than his Waterloos. 
</P>
<P>
4 Nolan Ryan no-hitters. He pitched his fifth for the Houston Astros, although 
he'd have had it much sooner if Rudy Meoli or Sandy Alomar -- or anybody -- 
decided to catch Thurman Munson's pop fly behind second base. 
</P>
<P>
5, as in Game 5. If Angel fans have forgiven, they will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
6 games, the extent of John D'Acquisto's Angel career. For $1.3 million, 
D'Acquisto gave the Angels no wins, no losses and a 10.71 earned-run average in 
1981. The same year, the Angels shelled out $1.5 million so Bill Travers could 
appear in four games and go 0-1 with a 8.38 ERA. It took them eight years to 
work up the courage to try it again with Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
7. Rick Burleson. Not one but two torn rotator cuffs. Less fortunate than Jim 
Fregosi and Dick Schofield, he might have been the best Angel shortstop of all. 
</P>
<P>
8. Bob Boone. He was purchased from Philadelphia for $300,000 and lost to 
Kansas City for $1. In between, he won four Gold Gloves and served as the 
Angels' finest catcher ever -- before and after 40. 
</P>
<P>
9. Rob Wilfong. Donnie Moore threw the home-run pitch and Doug DeCinces hit the 
first-pitch pop fly to right, but Wilfong was the hidden anti-hero of Game 5. 
After singling home the tying run in the bottom of the ninth, Wilfong froze at 
first base when the outfield relay went through to home plate. Had he taken 
second, Wilfong figured to score on Dick Schofield's ensuing single. Instead, 
both he and the Angels wound up stranded on third base. 
</P>
<P>
10 pitchers have made their professional debuts in the major leagues since the 
inception of the amateur draft. No one did it nearly as well as Jim Abbott, who 
won 12 games with a 3.92 ERA as a rookie -- and did it with one hand. 
</P>
<P>
11. Jim Fregosi. A six-time All-Star, the first Angel manager to win a division 
championship and the trade bait that lured Ryan from the Mets. He served this 
franchise well. 
</P>
<P>
12 consecutive losses to end the 1988 season, along with the managerial career 
of Cookie Rojas. Team September this has never been. 
</P>
<P>
13 managers. The roll call: Bill Rigney, Lefty Phillips, Del Rice, Bobby 
Winkles, Dick Williams, Norm Sherry, Dave Garcia, Jim Fregosi, Gene Mauch, John 
McNamara, Mauch again, Cookie Rojas, Doug Rader. Average: one manager per 2.2 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
14 home runs by Lee Stanton, which led the '75 Angels. They were known as 
Rabbits -- all speed and no pop -- and their team total of 55 home runs left 
them only six behind Roger Maris. 
</P>
<P>
15. Ted Kluszewski. Big Klu, an original Angel, checked in at 6-feet-2 and 240 
pounds. When Albie Pearson (5-5, 140) was assigned as his roommate, Kluszewski 
told him, "I get the bed and you get the dresser drawer." 
</P>
<P>
16 million dollars, and nearly as many crossed fingers, for Langston to make 
his Mark. 
</P>
<P>
17 Alex Johnson. The Angels' only batting champion, by the narrowest of margins 
-- .3289 to Carl Yastrzemski's .3286. If pitchers couldn't figure him out in 
1970, no one could in 1971, as Johnson brawled in the clubhouse, stalled on the 
basepaths and drew a suspension for "failure to hustle and improper mental 
attitude." By October of '71, he was gone, banished to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
18 seasons as also-rans before the first American League West title in 1979. 
Until then, the Angels had bettered the .500 mark five times and finished 
better than third only once. 
</P>
<P>
19 errors by Chili Davis in 1988, a club outfield record that should stand 
forever. Or so the Angels hope. 
</P>
<P>
20 innings on the night of July 9, 1971 -- and the morning of July 10. Tony 
Conigliaro lasted only 19, going 0 for 8 with five strikeouts before umpire 
Merle Anthony's merciful ejection. The Angels lost to an Angel -- Mangual, who 
singled home a run in the bottom of the 20th for a 1-0 Oakland victory -- and 
four hours later, Conigliaro announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
21. Wally Joyner. Some Angels live in their own little worlds. Wally had one 
named after him. 
</P>
<P>
22 victories by Ryan in 1974 to go with a 2.89 ERA and 367 strikeouts on a team 
that finished 68-94. The Cy Young Award still went to Catfish Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
23rd of September, 1978. Angel outfielder Lyman Bostock steps into the wrong 
car with the wrong woman and is killed by a shotgun blast from a jealous 
ex-husband. Bostock, twice a .300 hitter with the Minnesota Twins, was 27 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
24. Gary Pettis. If only baseball were a two-platoon sport. 
</P>
<P>
25 Don Baylor. The Angels' only league MVP and Buzzie Bavasi's second greatest 
mistake. When Baylor left Anaheim three years after Ryan, he went on to play in 
three World Series with Boston, Minnesota and Oakland. That's three more than 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
26. Gene Autry. That was the first uniform number retired by the Angels, who 
always considered Autry their "26th man." Autry appreciated the honor, but we 
can think of one thing he'd appreciate more. 
</P>
<P>
27 up and 27 down. Mike Witt saves his best for the last day of the 1984 
season, pitching a perfect game against a Texas Ranger team managed by Doug 
Rader. 
</P>
<P>
28. Bert Blyleven. For once, the curse was reversed. Blyleven went from 
Minnesota has-been (10-17, 5.43) to California hero (17-5, 2.73) in the span of 
one season, leaving a trail of smoldering shoelaces and smirking teammates in 
his wake. 
</P>
<P>
29. Rod Carew. If they retired his number out of guilt over the mishandling of 
his 1985 release, it was for the wrong reason. The right reasons: Four .300 
seasons as an Angel, a .314 average as an Angel and his 3,000th hit, which he 
delivered in 1985, as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
30 years of Angel baseball. The franchise hits the three-decade mark in 1990. 
Here's hoping it hits fewer bumps over the next 30.

Bruce Hurst. Eric Show. Andy Benes. Dennis Rasmussen. Ed Whitson . . . Sure, 
there are questions. Will Show's back be able to withstand the rigors of a full 
season? Will Benes go on to brilliance or pitch like someone with two months of 
big league experience? Will Rasmussen struggle as he did a year ago or perform 
brilliantly as he did in 1988? Will Whitson return for an encore or was last 
year a mirage?. . . . Only Hurst, who has averaged 16 victories a season for 
the past three years, enters the season without any questions. In his first 
season in the National League, he tied for first in complete games with 10, and 
was fourth in innings pitched with 244 2/3. His changeup is what makes him so 
effective. . . . Show underwent surgery in August to remove a disc from his 
lower back. He has not pitched in a major league game since June 25. . . . 
Benes was voted the rookie pitcher of the year by The Sporting News, despite 
playing in the majors just two months. Benes proved to be Dodger pitcher Orel 
Hershiser's biggest nemesis, beating Hershiser, 1-0, in each of his two starts 
against them. . . . Rasmussen, who pitched just one complete game last year, is 
due to for a splendid season. In even-numbered years, Rasmussen has posted a 
43-22 record. In odd-numbered years, he is 26-23. . . . Whitson is coming off 
the finest season of his 12-year career, establishing career bests with 16 
victories and a 2.66 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
He was 9-2 in his first 12 starts, but won just two games after July 5. He gave 
up 22 homers, but 16 were with the bases empty, and the other six were with 
just one runner on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RELIEF PITCHING 
</P>
<P>
Pat Clements. Mark Grant. Greg Harris. Craig Lefferts. Calvin Schiraldi. Rafael 
Valdez. . . . So much for the easy times. Mark Davis and his 44 saves fled to 
Kansas City, leaving the Padres with five relievers who combined for 29 saves 
last year. . . . Lefferts, who had 20 for the San Francisco Giants last season, 
is being counted on to fill the shoes of Davis. Lefferts opened last season 
with 13 2/3 consecutive shutout innings, retiring 29 batters in a row. In his 
first 17 appearances, he allowed just one run in 25 1/3, posting a 0.36 ERA. He 
relies heavily on his screwball and must have location with his fastball to be 
effective. . . . He's expected to receive right-handed help from Harris, who 
might have the best arm on the staff. Harris would likely be a starter in any 
other organization and one day might be added to the rotation. But the Padres 
need him to be a stopper and setup man for the bullpen. Last season, he saved 
six games in eight opportunities and allowed just six of 28 inherited runners 
to score. . . . Grant and Clements are capable middle relievers and will be 
used to set up the save situations. Grant and Clements will each be primarily 
pitching in middle and long relief. McKeon is looking for more consistency out 
of the two. Grant is coming off the finest season of his career, going 8-2 with 
a 3.33 ERA in 50 relief appearances. It was the first time since his 
professional career began in 1981 that he did not make a start. Clements' only 
defeat of the year occurred in his only start, July 1 in St. Louis. He'll also 
be used in spot situations this season to face left-handed hitters. . . . 
Schiraldi is the wild card of the bullpen. The Padres hope he'll fit into the 
stopper's picture. If not, he'll be used as the setup man. Schiraldi, who 
joined the Padres on Aug. 30, 1989, can be used in all roles. He would rather 
start, if he had his choice, but for now will remain in the bullpen. He'll be 
the man to join the rotation if one of the starters falters. . . . The bullpen 
has one rare quality. All but Lefferts started at least one game last season. . 
. . Valdez will be on the roster for the first three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CATCHER 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago will play all but 25 or 30 games. Mark Parent will play the 
rest. . . . Santiago just received a hefty raise to $1.25 million. His 
relationship with his manager never has been better. The Padres expect great 
improvement over his 1989 season in which he batted .236 with 16 homers and 62 
RBIs. . . . Few in the league are better than Parent in his role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIRST BASE 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the kind of club record the Padres were looking for when Jack Clark 
walked a record-setting 132 times. But after hitting just .217 with nine homers 
and 39 RBIs through June 28, Clark finished the last three months by hitting 17 
homers and driving in 55 runs with a .267 batting average. He finished the year 
with 26 homers and 94 RBIs. Now, with Joe Carter batting behind him, those 
figures should only increase. . . . Before you ignore the contributions Phil 
Stephenson could provide, you might want to note that he's the best defensive 
first baseman on the team, set the NCAA record at Wichita State with 87 stolen 
bases in 1982 and was a consistent .300 hitter in the minors. . . . Rob Nelson 
will remain with the team as one of three extra players allowed until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SECOND BASE 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar, 22, is a rotisserie player's dream. He has speed. He has power. 
He makes contact. He hit .295 with seven homers and 56 RBIs in 1989, and 
figures to only improve this season. It's essential that he improves in the 
field. He made a league-high 28 errors last season, much too many for a player 
of his talents. . . . Joey Cora will be Alomar's primary backup. He's a contact 
hitter with no power and decent range in the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIRD BASE 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts will never win a Gold Glove, but his quickness and agility enable 
him to be an everyday third baseman, if McKeon chooses. Roberts' strength is 
his offense. He scored 81 runs in just 329 plate-appearances as the Padres' 
leadoff hitter last season. He's capable of playing any position with the 
exception of catcher, first base and pitcher. . . . Mike Pagliarulo will play 
primarily against right-handed pitchers. He hit just .154 against lefties last 
season and likely will be allowed to face few this season. He's a solid 
defensive third baseman with a strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHORTSTOP 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton's left knee prevents him from having adequate range. Too many 
ground balls get past him, say the critics, but he possesses a strong, accurate 
arm. Templeton is coming off his best offensive season since 1985, batting .255 
with six homers and 40 RBIs. . . . Cora will be Templeton's backup, and Roberts 
will be the No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEFT FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lynn was supposed to be washed up. He's not only getting old, critics 
said, but he's fragile. So would you believe this injury-plagued 38-year-old 
man would be the Padres' opening day left fielder?. . . . Roberts will also 
spend much of his time in left. Although Lynn is a better outfielder, Roberts 
is a more dangerous offensive weapon. . . . Jerald Clark, a rookie, will add 
offensive punch off the bench but is a liability in the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTER FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter has averaged 31 home runs and 108 RBIs over the past four seasons 
while being surrounded by inferior talent. It's frightening to imagine what he 
might do with this supporting cast. Scouts say he's probably more suited for 
left, but that move probably won't occur until 1991. . . . Darrin Jackson will 
back him up in center and be used as a defensive replacement on occasions. . . 
. Shawn Abner will be one of the three extra players allowed until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIGHT FIELD 
</P>
<P>
They have a four-time batting champion who owns a career .332 batting average. 
He also has a streak of 74 consecutive at-bats without striking out. And in the 
field, he is a three-time Gold Glove winner. Anything else you want to know 
about Tony Gwynn?

OLDEST DODGER HELPED RICKEY GET ROBINSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few living Dodgers have not heard the words, or been touched by their legacy. 
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate, then, that the oldest living Dodger was there. 
</P>
<P>
It was an August afternoon, 1945. A Monday, if remembers correctly. Sukeforth 
had just brought a young shortstop, by train, to Brooklyn for a meeting with 
Dodgers' boss Branch Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey wanted to sign the young man to a minor league contract, but he wanted 
to get one thing straight. 
</P>
<P>
If Jackie Robinson was going to be the first black to play major league 
baseball, he has to be more than just a baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Sukeforth, now 88, stood in the back and listened. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey said it just like this," Sukeforth remembered. "He told Jackie, 'All my 
life I've been looking for a great colored player. I have reason to believe it 
is you. But I need more than a great colored player. 
</P>
<P>
'I need a player who will be able to take insults and abuse. I need a player 
who, if a man slides into him with his spikes up and hurts him, he will not 
come up swinging. I need a man who will carry the flag for his race.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sukeforth said he will never forget Robinson's response, and Rickey's reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie said, 'Don't you want a man with courage enough to fight back?' " 
Sukeforth recalled. "And then Branch Rickey said, 'No Jackie, I want a man with 
courage enough not to fight back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sukeforth said that Robinson's ensuing pause, which probably lasted no more 
than a few seconds, has with time become an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie waited, and waited, and waited before answering," Sukeforth said. "We 
were all just looking at him. Then he said he would do it. And the rest, well . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
The rest has been a big part of Sukeforth's history. 
</P>
<P>
True, he was a backup Dodger catcher from 1932-34, and then again during the 
1945 war-torn season. He was a Dodger manager briefly in 1947. He was a Dodger 
coach for the next five years. He played with Hack Wilson and Lefty O'Doul and 
Van Lingle Mungo. He was teacher of the Boys of Summer. 
</P>
<P>
But he will always be best known as the Dodger official who scouted and helped 
sign Jackie Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
In searching for the oldest living Dodger in celebration of their 100th 
anniversary season this year, the club could have found worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody called me a little while ago and told me I was the oldest," Sukeforth 
said from his home in the tiny coastal town of Waldoboro, Maine. "That's kind 
of hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
Sukeforth, who was born on Nov. 30, 1901, has never been to Dodger Stadium. He 
said the only person he knows in the current organization is Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda. He said he has not been invited to any centennial celebrations, nor 
would he likely attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled all I care to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, through Robinson, he will be forever linked to the richest piece of the 
organization's heritage. And he said it started on a simple assignment given to 
him in August of 1945 while he was scouting the Negro National League in the 
New York area. 
</P>
<P>
"I was called in by Mr. Rickey one day, and he said, 'I want you to go to 
Chicago and see this ballplayer named Robinson,' " Sukeforth recalled. "Mr. 
Rickey told me he wanted to see how he threw from the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was playing for the Kansas City Monarchs, who had traveled to Chicago 
to play the Lincoln Giants. Sukeforth arrived at the Friday night game early, 
introduced himself to Robinson, and told him what he was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing Jackie said was, 'Why is Mr. Rickey interested in my arm?' " 
Sukeforth recalled. "I told him that was a good question. I told him he should 
ask Mr. Rickey that question himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he told me he had fallen on his shoulder two days ago, and was going to 
be out for a few more days." 
</P>
<P>
According to the enterprising Sukeforth, it turned out to be one of the 
luckiest injuries in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind got to clicking and I thought, if he has three days off, maybe I can 
get him to New York right away," Sukeforth said. "So I met him at the hotel 
after the game, and he agreed to go to New York, so I made all the train 
reservations and a couple of days later we went. The whole way he would ask, 
'Why does Mr. Rickey want to see me?' I could not give him an answer." 
</P>
<P>
Sukeforth said that once in New York, he simply introduced Robinson to Rickey 
and stood in the background and listened. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking like a typical scout, Sukeforth said that Robinson was not the best 
black player available then. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew he wasn't the best," Sukeforth said. "Guys all over the Negro 
League were wondering, why him? But he was one of the youngest and smartest and 
strongest. And that's what we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Sukeforth was then assigned much of the legwork in preparation for Robinson's 
eventual step to the major leagues. He appointed several Dodgers to make sure 
Robinson was never alone or inactive at his first spring training, to avoid 
incidents. He also contacted many predominately black churches in New York and 
asked the congregations who come to Ebbets Field not to cheer for Jackie any 
more than they would cheer for anybody else, also to avoid incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, when Robinson made the Dodgers in 1947 after a year at triple-A 
Montreal, Sukeforth was named Dodger manager. But Sukeforth found the 'modern' 
ballplayer to be difficult and quit after just two games. Even though he says 
both were wins. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, it was just too much of a headache anymore," Sukeforth said. "I had 
managed in the minor leagues and the players were getting harder to manage 
every year." 
</P>
<P>
What is it they say about some things never changing?

CHILI DAVIS PROVES HE'S WORTH HIS HIGH PRODUCTION VALUES; 
</P>
<P>
DEPENDABLE: OUTFIELDER COMES THROUGH IN CLUTCH, AND DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND THAT 
HIS REPUTATION FAILS TO MATCH HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Let's talk run production. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis led the Angels in runs batted in again last year, becoming only the 
fourth player in club history to lead that category for two consecutive seasons 
with 90 or more each year. 
</P>
<P>
How about clutch hitting? 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of Davis' RBIs either tied the game or put the Angels 
ahead. Seven of his team-high 22 home runs were three-run shots. 
</P>
<P>
Recognition? Fame? Glory? 
</P>
<P>
Call Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington says of Davis: "My brother does not get his due." General 
Manager Mike Port, with a bent for elocution, feels pretty much the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Other fellows, for whatever reason, are more frequently acknowledged as being 
tough in the clutch or get more notoriety given similar RBI production," Port 
said. "But this is a guy who enjoys playing and gives you a lot of effort and 
time out on the field, very productive time at that. 
</P>
<P>
"He very quietly drives in 90 runs a year. It's also the manner of the man, 
though. You're not going to find Chili soliciting a lot of attention." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is in the second year of a three-year contract that pays him $1.375 
million for this season and $1.45 in 1991, so it's obvious Port isn't one of 
those who have overlooked Davis' contributions. And that, Davis says smiling, 
is the kind of notability he values most. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for recognition . . . just money," he says with a laugh. 
"Anyway, I don't think I've done anything all that great to be plastered on the 
cover of Sports Illustrated every week. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I came into this game, I've been in that slot where you're going to 
come up to bat a lot with runners on base. And you're supposed to drive those 
runs in because that's what you're being paid for. Some guys are paid to get on 
base and score a lot of runs. Some guys are paid for defense. Pitchers are paid 
to get guys out. I'm paid to drive in runs." 
</P>
<P>
But don't let Davis' a-day's-work-for-a-day's-pay spiel fool you. He may 
project a cavalier image, but he's not the type to take the money and run. Or 
even take the money and jog out a ground ball, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' determination to win surfaces when he least expects it, such as when he 
dismisses his run production with another "just-doing-my-job" routine. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, it's not the runs that you drive in that you think about," he said. 
"It's the ones you miss. If you finish a year with 150 RBIs, you'd still think 
about the 50 you missed." 
</P>
<P>
That attitude was an important factor in the Angels' decision to shell out $4.1 
million and give Davis a three-year contract. They like the way he bats, but 
they admire the way he battles even more. 
</P>
<P>
"The single most important thing for Chili is winning," Port said. "He will 
call me several times over the course of the winter, wanting to know what's on 
tap to improve the club. And every time he sees me, he flicks his fingers. He 
wants a World Series ring. That's his No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, that's his No. 1 dream. His top priority is to maintain his 
self-esteem and enjoy the game . . . while it lasts. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm playing and I'm not cheating myself, not dogging it, I'm 
happy," Davis said. "What disappoints people is if you're not giving the 100% 
you owe yourself, the organization and the fans every time you go out there. If 
you goof up giving 100%, well, it's going to happen. But if you goof up giving 
50%, then people aren't going to accept it. And you shouldn't accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Chili knows goofing up. In 1988, he set the team record for errors by an 
outfielder with 19. Port says that season of defensive discontent was an 
aberration. After being switched from right field to left field last year, 
Davis made just six errors. 
</P>
<P>
But the images of that infamous, early-1988 string of miscues -- often the 
highlights of the evening news sports segments -- don't easily fade from 
memory. And Port thinks the defensive lapse is still robbing Davis of deserved 
renown. 
</P>
<P>
"The only rationale that I can offer is that maybe some of what Chili Davis is 
as a man and what he means to this club is a tad overshadowed by what people 
recall from two years ago, when he was in right field, when he struggled 
defensively and was off to a slow start with the bat. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, as is human nature, people formulated opinions then and have 
overlooked the fact that he has meant a lot to this club." 
</P>
<P>
Davis seems genuinely unaffected, however, and he's certainly not going to 
waste any time pouting over a lack of attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only going to play so long and when it's over, it's over. I started out in 
center field, moved to right and then moved to left. Probably, a couple of 
years down the line, I'll DH. And before you know it, I'll be riding around the 
field in a golf cart." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the Angels hope their Davis has more rings than Sammy Davis Jr. 
And, considering the apparent strength of the American League West again this 
season, they'll need another healthy dash of Chili power if they hope to cook 
up a trip to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Angels were 16-4 in the games in which Davis homered. They came 
up eight games short of tying for the division title. Davis, 30, figures he can 
chip in another eight homers and match his age. So, if all else remains equal . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Morgan once told me that he hit his peak at 30 years old," Davis said. "So 
I've gauged myself for 30. I'm expecting a real big year, not just for me but 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 30 homers is a very reachable goal. It's just a matter of starting off 
the season well, getting some balls and driving them. I need to start off with 
a couple of months of hitting .350 and poppin' some balls. You'd like to have 
maybe 15 at the break and carry on after that." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had the fifth-best record in baseball last year. From June 23 to 
Sept. 1, they never were more than three games out of first and they even had a 
2 1/2-game lead in late July. But the bubble burst in September, when they went 
2-8 against Cleveland, Kansas City and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of guys who hadn't played together, but we blended well and we 
were a good team in a tough division," Davis said. "We won a lot of games but 
it just wasn't enough. It's obvious we're going to have to go out and really 
bust our butts." 
</P>
<P>
Davis showed up in Mesa, Ariz., after the lockout looking quite trim, probably 
close to the 210 pounds he's listed at in the media guide. Last year, he showed 
up for spring training looking, well, to use his own word, "fat." 
</P>
<P>
He worked hard this off-season, thanks in part to a suggestion by a certain 
interested party who has been known to ask his players to step outside when he 
felt it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a guy tell me and a few other players at end of the season last year, 
'You guys are all going to be 30 next year, so come to camp in shape.' 
</P>
<P>
"He once said that he'd take any of us on and I didn't feel like fighting him. 
So I came to camp in shape." 
</P>
<P>
But when you ask Davis to identify the party in question, he laughs and says, 
"Gene Autry." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader loves having Davis in his lineup. The Angel manager likes all those 
line drives and the rare luxury of a having a switch-hitter with bona fide 
power from both sides of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He also thinks Davis sets a great example. He says Davis is a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
Don't tell Chili, though. 
</P>
<P>
"This team doesn't need leaders," Davis says. "We've got a manager who's been 
around. Everybody here is the type of player who takes care of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate that tag. You do something for a few years and all of a sudden, boom, 
you've got to be a leader. What the hell are you going to lead? People are 
going to be people. I'm not Moses or somebody." 
</P>
<P>
When appraised of Davis' rather forceful feelings on the subject, Rader smiles 
and politely disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"He's wrong. You do need leaders. You need people to set examples. 
Unfortunately, most people perceive a leader as a rah-rah guy and that's 
ridiculous. The leaders are the people who govern themselves properly and set 
good examples. In that respect, Chili Davis meets my criteria for being a 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
As much as he shuns the role, Davis isn't so humble as to refuse to give a tip 
to the younger players who want to learn how to swing a big stick in the big 
leagues. His advice: "Don't listen to anyone's advice." 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting is just a matter of experimenting, constant experimenting, to find out 
what works best for you. And when something works, you stick with it. And once 
you start catching up to pitches you couldn't hit before, the pitchers will 
change and you'll have to go through the whole routine all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you think Wally Joyner hit 34 home runs one year and 13 the next? Can 
you say Wally is no longer a home-run hitter? With that swing and the power and 
the contact he makes? 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, you hope to find an approach that will enable you to hit the pitch 
inside and the pitch out over the plate and hit the fastball and the curveball. 
But you've got to find it for you. Nobody's going to find it for you." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who believes he will have a banner year if he can raise his average as a 
right-handed hitter to .270 (he hit .245 from that side in '89), did seek some 
help during the off-season, however. He spent some time with former Angel Rod 
Carew, refining his approach against left-handed pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"We adjusted a few things," Davis said. "I have to take charge of home plate 
this year and be more aggressive. I'm not the kind of hitter who'll go up there 
and pick a pitch. If I see something close enough to hit, I'm going to swing at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis also knows that you could sell your soul to the devil for Ted 
Williams' swing and it wouldn't do you any good without the right mental 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're confident, you know you're going to get a hit and when you get a 
ball to drive, you don't ever miss it," he said. "But as soon as you start 
wondering when it's going to end, that's when you lose it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys start out having great years, but they don't really believe it. 
When you're swinging the bat that well, you've got to remember it is you doing 
it. It's not a dream." 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of hot Chili could be the key to a dream season for the Angels, 
and if Port can work a trade for another run-producer to bolster the lineup, 
Davis may see more pitches to his liking in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been an aggressive swinger, but over the years I've learned which 
pitches I can hit hard and which pitches I can't," he said. "Pitches that I can 
hit hard, I really go after. The ones I can't, I just try to place and take 
whatever they're giving." 
</P>
<P>
It he takes enough of what they're giving, he might get what's coming to him: a 
little respect.

PARRISH'S INSIDE JOB GIVES PITCHERS FOCUS; 
</P>
<P>
RESURGENCE: CATCHER HELPED TURN AROUND STAFF LAST SEASON. CHANGE OF SCENERY 
ALSO AIDED HIS HITTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
No one wants to talk about it, so the question remains unanswered: Just how 
valuable was the inside information Lance Parrish brought to the Angels last 
season? 
</P>
<P>
Quite a ruckus surrounded the debate last year. Was Parrish, the Angels' Mr. 
Inside who insisted pitchers work the ball in on hitters, a pivotal factor in 
the resurgence of the Angel staff? Did Bob Boone, the former Angel catcher who 
fled to Kansas City when Parrish showed up in Anaheim, have an outside chance 
of defending himself? 
</P>
<P>
It's a touchy subject. Most Angel pitchers tiptoe around the fringes of the 
controversy, much the same way they try to paint the black edges of home plate 
with their pitches. Some would rather throw a belt-high fastball down the 
middle to Jose Canseco than give a straight answer on this one. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make any comparisons to anyone else," Kirk McCaskill said, 
"but Lance is a skilled catcher, a very aggressive catcher, and it's a pleasure 
to throw to him." 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, certain Angel pitchers who aren't so concerned with 
diplomacy. Reliever Greg Minton, for one, is more likely to say whatever is on 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Lance came in at the right time," Minton said. "(Pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann) has been trying to get people to go in there ever since I came here, 
but previous catchers just weren't that type of catchers. Now, the pitching 
coach and the catcher are both in line. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I like to throw to a catcher's chest. Bob wanted you to pick out a 
kneecap on his shin guard and throw to that. With Lance, you've got 235 pounds 
of huge human and half of that huge chest is sitting halfway behind the hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He just puts one finger down, scoots that big body in there and it's a lot 
easier to get inside that way." 
</P>
<P>
There were, of course, a number of factors that contributed to the Angel 
staff's incredible one-point drop in earned-run average -- 4.32 in 1988 to 3.28 
in '89 -- in just one season, including the additions of Bert Blyleven and Jim 
Abbott, the maturation of Chuck Finley and the health of McCaskill. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it would be unfair to single out any one individual as being the key 
player. So just how much of the credit should go to Parrish? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any credit," he said, "and I don't want to make a big deal about 
it. The pitchers are the ones that made it work and then stuck with it." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish will admit, however, that he calls an aggressive game, refusing to 
allow hitters free reign. You don't want to be leaning out over the plate a lot 
if the pitcher is throwing to Parrish's target. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never met a pitching coach who doesn't believe you have to pitch inside 
to be successful," he said. "Even if you don't come inside with strikes, you 
have to establish the inside so you can work the outside part of the plate. And 
these guys understood the necessity of it. To set up the rest of your pitches, 
you just have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked at it last spring and once they saw that the approach could be 
successful for them, they had no problem letting me lead a bit more. It worked 
initially, they were willing to accept my pitch selection, and that set the 
tone for the season." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish is quick to point out, however, that none of this is an indictment of 
Boone. Asking for inside pitches is one thing, getting them is quite another. 
Parrish knows. He spent two frustrating seasons (1987, '88) in Philadelphia 
where his philosophies fell on deaf ears, not mention some dead arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a great year for me from a confidence standpoint," Parrish said. 
"The two years in Philadelphia were demoralizing in terms of what I could 
contribute to the pitching staff as a catcher. We went nowhere. I basically 
tried to instill the same ideas that I did here, it's just that these guys were 
more receptive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why everyone here is trying to walk a fine line. No one wants to 
discredit Bob Boone or anything that he's ever done. He's a tremendous catcher 
and who's to say he didn't try to do the same things and it didn't work. As a 
catcher, sometimes you try to establish something, but the staff doesn't feel 
comfortable with it. Then you've got to go to Plan B." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were so ecstatic with the way Plan A was working out last year, 
anything Parrish did with the bat was almost gravy. When he had 13 home runs 
and 43 RBIs by the end of July, General Manager Mike Port must have felt like 
he'd made the deal of the century when he picked up the six-time All-Star for 
what appeared to be a very cost-efficient $1.2 million for the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Parrish hit .325 with six homers and 16 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 5, however, the banner year came crashing down when Milwaukee's Glenn 
Braggs came barreling around third and Parrish, predictably, stood his ground 
at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Braggs hit him on the dead run," Minton said, wincing. "And I mean that guy is 
chiseled pretty good. Braggs is built the way I am in my dreams. Lance said he 
was fine, but the next day, he had four or five big purple spots on his body." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Parrish was not fine. He suffered serious contusions of the right knee 
and his rib cage and hit only .192 with six RBIs and two homers after the 
collision. He played in 33 of the final 52 games, but he would have been out on 
the field more often if Manager Doug Rader had not "listened to the little 
voice in my head" and rested a protesting Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
"We just enjoy projecting what his year would have been like last year," Port 
said. "(The collision) definitely hampered his swing. When you think of Lance 
Parrish offensively, you think in the range of in excess of 20 home runs, 
80-plus RBIs and roughly a .270 batting average and he was on that track last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many times when he had every reason to tell Doug, 'Not today, I'm 
not quite up to it.' But he was a big enough individual to take it out there 
with what he had, for the sake of the club, and that was appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
That's an understatement. Last winter, the Angels gave Parrish a $500,000 
signing bonus on a three-year contract which will pay him $1.75 million this 
year and $2.25 million the next two. What Parrish did when he was less than 
100% might have earned him more money than what he accomplished when he was 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Lance's durability is amazing," catcher Bill Schroeder said. "When there's a 
question about whether or not he can play, he's always out there. He can be 
really hurting and he still will be out there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to play when you're strong and feeling good, but when you're 
stuffing (slumping) with the bat and hurting, it takes something extra. Lance 
has it to give. I guess he knows the team needs him out there for rhythm and 
continuity." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Parrish simply would like to find a sense of personal continuity 
this season. He averaged 28 homers and 92 RBIs in his last five seasons with 
Detroit, but struggled both years with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems for last three years I haven't been able to put together a consistent 
season," he said. "In '88, I had a good first half then hurt my back in the 
middle of season and wasn't very productive in the second half. Last year was 
very similar. I got in that groove and then my offensive numbers just stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to put together a solid season and if I do, there's no reason why 
I shouldn't hit 20 home runs and maybe have 80 or more RBIs. I expect that out 
of myself and I'm sure the club think's I'm capable of that." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish's knee wasn't completely healed until late January, so he admits that 
the shortened spring training may affect him later in the season. Still, the 
33-year-old veteran of 12 years in the majors figures he can catch "120, 130, 
even 140" games this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, I feel real strong," he said, "but I have to be realistic. They're 
going to try and preserve some of my energy. They'll just look to see how I 
handle the load and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
You can bet the Angels are hoping Parrish's appropriately massive shoulders can 
bear a considerable burden. There was, however, a question of whether he would 
even be on the roster for '90. He was declared a "new look" free agent after 
last season as a result of baseball's second collusion case. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was granted my free agency, I didn't want to leave here," said Parrish, 
who lives in Yorba Linda. "I mean, being home with your family is the best. And 
you can't say enough about what it's like to be on a team that's winning and 
having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping that everything would work out so I wouldn't have to be put in a 
situation where I'd even have to consider leaving. The Angels were honest and 
fair and I feel fortunate that things worked out the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the feeling is mutual.

DOWNING REIGNS AS ANGELS' SELF-MADE SURVIVOR; 
</P>
<P>
LONGEVITY: AFTER 12 UP-AND-DOWN SEASONS IN ANAHEIM, HE KEEPS PLAYING AND HOPING 
FOR A CHANCE TO LESSEN THE PAIN WITH A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
While many of his teammates were sleep-walking through the first intrasquad 
game of the spring, Brian Downing was sliding into second and ripping a hole in 
his pants. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tina Turner, Downing never, ever, does anything nice and easy. He has 
barreled headlong through 17 seasons in the major leagues, surviving with a 
combination of savvy and brawn, often staggering but refusing to fall. 
</P>
<P>
And Downing is the embodiment of the Angel experience, a player who in many 
ways mirrors the franchise for which he has labored the past 12 seasons. He's a 
bare-knuckles brawler in a finesse game and, like the Angels, has achieved his 
greatest successes through brute offensive force. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, he's the oldest player in the majors who has yet to make it to the World 
Series; there are scars on his psyche from the near misses of 1979, '82 and 
'86, which left the deepest wound. ("If I played 10 more years and we won it 
all every year, it still wouldn't wash away that pain," Downing says). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he's often intense to the point of brooding. His glare -- and on one 
occasion his bat -- have chased away many a sportswriter. Even to some of his 
teammates, Downing remains an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian, well, he's just Brian," said one Angel, shrugging, "but if I ever have 
a meaningful conversation with him, I'll let you know." 
</P>
<P>
Still, you don't have to understand Downing to respect him. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there are people with more natural ability, but Brian Downing just 
will not let himself fail," General Manager Mike Port said. "He's an example to 
those with more capabilities that you have no excuse for not getting the best 
out of yourself. To be compared to Brian, that would be the ultimate compliment 
for a baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
Downing's lunging swing might not be pretty and his stride on the basepaths 
won't remind anyone of Carl Lewis. But if you're management, you've got to love 
the guy's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a player is pretty much self-made, you have to admire him greatly," 
Manager Doug Rader said. "Most of us cannot work at that level. Most of us are 
lazy by nature. But he's done some fantastic things with his career and you 
have to admire the work that goes into that. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian is every inch a man." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the man has been a barometer for the Angels. He has ridden this 
roller coaster to breathtaking heights that were invariably followed by 
nauseating nose dives. He has been with the Angels as they rose to the American 
League Championship Series three times. And he has endured each of the three 
following-season crashes, when they finished a total of 71 games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
When he has been at his best, so have the Angels. In '79, when the franchise 
won its first AL West title, Downing hit .326. In '82, he hit 28 home runs. In 
'86, he drove in 95 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing is embarking on his 13th season with a halo on his hat. It's hard 
to believe that almost-shoulder-length locks fell out of his first Angel cap. 
Now, there's a trace of gray underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Angels' reigning patriarch reluctantly agreed to relive the past 
and ponder the future. What follows is a most introspective view of the past 
dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
Buckle your seat belts, it's a bumpy ride. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE HEADY '70s 
</P>
<P>
Downing recently had completed his fifth less-than-spectacular season with the 
Chicago White Sox and was working out in a health club near his Yorba Linda 
home on Dec. 5, 1977 when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
He had been traded with pitchers Chris Knapp and Dave Frost to the Angels for 
outfielders Bobby Bonds and Thad Bosley and pitcher Rich Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
"All I could think about was that I was coming home to Anaheim," he said. "I 
was working out when I heard about the deal and my strength went up enormously. 
I was on Cloud 9. 
</P>
<P>
"But the television newscasts were pretty critical of the trade and my joy 
quickly turned when they started ripping me. After all, the Angels were giving 
up Bobby Bonds and I thought Thad Bosley was a great prospect at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitchers were the focus of the trade for the Angels, I was just along for 
the ride. But still, I was nervous. There was a lot of intimidation because of 
the high quality people they gave up . . . and I really wasn't much of a 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone on the Angels welcomed Downing home with open arms. He began the 
season platooning behind the plate with Terry Humphrey because Nolan Ryan and 
Frank Tanana prefered throwing to Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry was catching Ryan and Tanana and I was catching the other three 
starters," Downing said. "(Manager Jim) Fregosi (who replaced Dave Garcia after 
46 games in '78) finally put me back there every day, but I could see where 
Nolan and Frank were coming from. They were superstar pitchers who wanted to 
throw to somebody they knew. And it was tough because it seemed like every time 
you looked up in those days, the Angels had a new catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an intricate balance between a catcher and a pitcher and I was 
basically just an offensive player playing catcher. My primary focus always has 
been hitting. It's not that my heart wasn't in it, it's just that I was never 
much of a finesse catcher. I was pretty aggressive. I liked to charge right 
after the hitters, sort of a here-it-is-now-hit-it style." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels finished 87-75 in 1978 and Downing admitted that he harbored great 
expectations for the following year. However, 1979 turned out to be better than 
he ever dared dream. 
</P>
<P>
"The off-season after the '78 season was my first real year of free-weight 
training," he said. "I accomplished some things in the weight room that changed 
my life, really. I never had much self-confidence and I made some numerical 
goals that year that gave me some real self-esteem. There are a lot of 
parallels between the weight room and life. 
</P>
<P>
"I made this one particular goal on the last workout before I left for spring 
training. I remember thinking all day about how important it was to accomplish 
what I set out to do and when I did it, I left for training camp on a natural 
life high." 
</P>
<P>
Downing, equipped with a new open stance that helped him pick up the ball 
earlier as well as an upper body that made him look like a Bulgarian 
weightlifter in double knits, was soon to reach new altitudes on the hit 
parade. For a while, Downing and the Angels were No. 1 with a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything just clicked," he said, smiling. "It just snowballed. Everyone did 
great. The offense was spectacular and the pitching wasn't bad. But it was so 
much fun because the game was never over. We were known for those magical 
last-minute victories." 
</P>
<P>
Downing's season reached an early peak about the time of the All-Star break. He 
was hitting .352 and had been named to his first -- and only -- All-Star team. 
And the Angels were playing a series with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game was Nolan Ryan's famous near no-hitter (an eventual one-hitter 
that the Angels won, 6-1). In the second game, Don Baylor homered in the eighth 
off Goose Gossage and then hit a three-run homer off him in the ninth to tie 
the game. (Downing scored the winning run in the 12th). In the third game, 
Bobby Grich hit a two-run homer with two out in the ninth and we won, 5-4. Then 
I left for the All-Star game in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something really special. That week was like the epitome for me." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels won the division by three games and lost to Baltimore in the 
then-best-of-five league championship series. The Orioles won the first two 
games in Baltimore, 3-0, and 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have won one of those, I really would have liked our chances in 
Game Five with Nolan Ryan pitching at 5 o'clock in Anaheim," Downing said. "But 
that one didn't hurt so much. I think a lot of us felt like we had a good 
season anyway . . . and that's probably why we lost." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ACHES OF THE '80s 
</P>
<P>
"On my first at-bat in 1980, I hit a grand slam," Downing said. "I thought, 
'This is going to be a great year.' Four days later, I got my ankle shattered 
(during a collision at home plate with Oakland's Rickey Henderson) and missed 
almost the whole year." 
</P>
<P>
It was a lost year for the entire franchise. The Angels lost 95 games as their 
players dropped onto the disabled list with a stunning succession of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened so fast. Baylor, (Dan) Ford, myself all went down fast. I remember 
one road trip where nine players stayed back for treatment. We just lost too 
many pivotal players and we didn't have the people to come in and help out." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels staggered through the strike-shortened '81 season, too, but their 
famous ball-crushing offense peaked in 1982, Gene Mauch's first full year as 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved leading off for that team," said Downing, who has been a reluctant No. 
1 hitter off and on for years. "Getting to play with all those future Hall of 
Famers was a highlight of my life. I mean Baylor, Reggie (Jackson), (Rod) 
Carew, (Fred) Lynn, Grich and (Doug) DeCinces all in the same lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitching was only so-so, but that was a great, great offensive team. If we 
had that offense and the (pitching) staff we have now, nobody would ever stop 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Angels were stopped, though, by an equally explosive offense when the 
Brewers beat them in the league championship series. Bob McClure, now an Angel 
reliever, picked up a 4-3 victory in the fifth and deciding game at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels wallowed in post-good-season depression and lost 92 games in 1983. 
They managed to finish second in both of the next two seasons, however, falling 
just one game short in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Now an outfielder, Downing began a stretch in 1984 when he would hit 20 or more 
homers and drive in an average of 83 runs every season until last year. He set 
a major league record for consecutive errorless games (244) in 1983 and then 
went on another 229-game stretch that ended in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, Mauch was back for his second term as manager and the Angels were 
poised for a third shot at the World Series, not to forget a third agonizing 
shot into Brian Downing's heart. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels and Red Sox split the first two games of the seven-game 1986 
playoffs. The Angels took a 3-1 lead in games after sweeping the first two at 
Anaheim Stadium before Boston rallied for a 7-6, 11-inning victory in Game No. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
"All the talk about (the late Donnie Moore's) one pitch (that Dave Henderson 
hit for a game-tying home run) was ridiculous," Downing says. "To put that loss 
in Donnie's lap is a joke. We came back to tie the game, didn't we? And we came 
this close to blowing open Game 6 in the first inning back in Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Then the Red Sox rolled to an 8-1 victory in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget those images," Downing said. "I didn't sleep well for a 
long, long while. The nightmares kept coming. There's a permanent scar and I'll 
never be able to come to grips with it." 
</P>
<P>
Downing grieved as much for the long-tormented Mauch as he did for himself. The 
former Angel manager was one of the few people who had been able to establish a 
genuine rapport with Downing. 
</P>
<P>
"He always knew exactly what was on my mind, exactly what I was trying to do 
with a pitcher or the way I approached an at-bat," Downing said. "It was 
uncanny really. We could communicate with facial signals. Mauch really 
understood me. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hurt that we couldn't win it for him. And we should have. That was 
the best overall team we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON TO THE '90s 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing flexes his biceps and prepares to face a new decade. 
</P>
<P>
And no one seems ready to give up on Downing until he's ready to give up on 
himself. So who knows how long this saga might continue? 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Downing credits his longevity to two factors: weight training and the trade to 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for the trade to California, I would have been out of baseball 
by 1980," he said. "There's no question about that. And if I hadn't started 
weight training, I wouldn't have made it into the '80s. That's the '80s. Never 
mind the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying weight training is for everyone. But my style is not predicated 
on looking pretty. I've never been able to master the idea of body leverage and 
without weight training, I couldn't hit the ball within 20 feet of the warning 
track. And the mental aspect that has gone along with the weight training has 
been just as vital. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest is just a matter of identifying your capabilities and limitations and 
adjusting accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds simple enough, but remember, nothing is easy for Brian Downing. And 
so it is with the question of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby (Grich) retired the day after the '86 season ended and I could 
understand how he felt. I wanted to do the same thing myself. It was so tough 
to play through that pain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crossed my mind every year since we lost in the playoffs, but every time 
I talk about it, my friends -- and, believe or not I do have a few friends -- 
say, 'If you quit, this will be the year they win it.' " 
</P>
<P>
So far, Downing has been unable to force himself to walk away from the game 
that has given him so much joy and so much agony. "The first baseball game I 
ever saw was the third game of the 1959 World Series between the Dodgers and 
White Sox," he said. "There were 90-some thousand people there and I can 
remember feeling the electricity in the air. I could feel it from the top of my 
head down to my toes. 
</P>
<P>
"That left an indelible impression on me. That got me going and I've never lost 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, he has never lost the desire to win, to win it all, a void in his 
career that will haunt him until he can rub his thumb across the inside of his 
finger and feel the reassuring lump of that championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
"That ring is my sole motivation now," he said. "To be a champion in major 
league baseball. I envision it as the exact opposite feeling as the one in '86. 
</P>
<P>
"Just once, I'd like to go from the floor to the ceiling." 
</P>

AT 39, BERT BLYLEVEN CONTINUES TO THROW HITTERS -- AND LIFE -- HIS GREAT CURVE

<TEXT>
<P>
You can just imagine the conversation between the producer and casting 
director: 
</P>
<P>
"I need a pitcher who can give up a home run. And quick!" 
</P>
<P>
A few calls later: "Uh, sir, we have Mr. Blyleven on the line." 
</P>
<P>
So began the silver-screen career of Bert Blyleven, Angel pitcher, long-ball 
server. Barring editing-room cuts, Blyleven will make his movie debut this 
summer when "Filofax," a film starring Jim Belushi, is released. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a bit role in which Blyleven gives up a home run to Chicago's Mark 
Grace that wins the World Series for Belushi's beloved Cubs. An incarcerated 
Belushi stages a jailbreak to attend the game and makes a fabulous catch of 
Grace's homer in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Joe Torre notices and seeks Belushi out for an interview. Belushi 
thinks the cops are after him. There's a chase scene through Anaheim Stadium. . 
. . OK, enough of the script. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, Blyleven won't be on the Academy Awards invitation list, but 
the experience did give the 39-year-old pitcher an appreciation for actors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of hard work, and you have to admire guys like Jim Belushi, because 
the stress is really on them to do take after take after take," Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
So, how long did it take Blyleven to give up the home run? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that only took a couple of pitches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yep, they found the right man for this job. The mound has at times been 
Blyleven's personal gopher hill, a starting point for the major league-record 
50 home runs he allowed in 1986 and the 46 he gave up in 1987. In eight other 
seasons during his 20-year career, Blyleven has allowed 20 or more homers. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood apparently knew of his reputation, but Blyleven didn't feel exploited 
or miscast, even though he yielded just 14 home runs last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the perfect role for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one that barely scratches Blyleven's potential as a performer. Blyleven, 
who will start today's opener for the Angels against Seattle, is a multifaceted 
pitcher who has handled a variety of roles throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
To the managers he has played for, Blyleven has been a pillar of consistency, a 
pitcher they can almost always rely on for seven solid innings per start and 
200 innings a season. 
</P>
<P>
To his teammates, Blyleven has been a practical joker who can strike at any 
time, a guy who helps keep the players loose and the clubhouse atmosphere 
light. 
</P>
<P>
To opponents, Blyleven has been the bearded villain, possessing possibly the 
game's best curveball, a blur of a bender that baffles even the best batters. 
</P>
<P>
To fans, Blyleven has been a regular on the transaction page, a talented and 
well-traveled pitcher who has been the ace of several mediocre staffs but also 
helped two teams win world championships. 
</P>
<P>
To his family, Blyleven has been a fun-loving father who acts more like a kid. 
</P>
<P>
And to writers, Blyleven has been a paradox -- he is often funny and quotable 
but sometimes crude and obnoxious. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven will never be typecast. His body of work is a wide and varied one. A 
retrospective: 
</P>
<P>
Some thought Blyleven's horrendous 1988 season, in which he went 10-17 with a 
career-high 5.43 earned-run average for the Minnesota Twins, was the beginning 
of Blyleven's fade to retirement. If he wasn't over the hill, he was looking 
down the other side of it. 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port had a different view. He traded three 
minor-league prospects for Blyleven in a move that paid immediate dividends. 
Blyleven, recovered from the thumb injury that hampered him for much of 1988, 
went 17-5 with a 2.73 ERA last season, leading the American League in shutouts 
with five. 
</P>
<P>
Nine times during the season, he won a game following an Angel loss. He stopped 
losing streaks of five and seven games. The Sporting News and UPI named 
Blyleven Comeback Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, however, insists he never left. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Minnesota felt that because of all the years, I was toward the end of 
my career," Blyleven said. "I kept telling them I wasn't, but they wouldn't 
believe me. So . . . 'em!" 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven sounds bitter, but says he isn't. He requested a two-year contract 
extension in 1988, but negotiations with Twins GM Andy MacPhail broke down and 
Blyleven threatened to become a free agent. MacPhail, looking for more than the 
draft choice he'd receive if Blyleven became a free agent, got what he could 
for Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect Andy MacPhail," Blyleven said. "He could have traded me to Cleveland 
or Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who grew up a few miles from Anaheim Stadium, thrived in the Big A, 
going 8-1. He also allowed only 14 home runs, nine with the bases empty. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not any more intelligent than many of our peers, but we felt Bert being 
from the area, not having the thumb problem and getting him into an outdoor 
park might all be part of a mix that would help him pitch better," Port said. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in one more ingredient -- Blyleven's desire for vindication -- and the 
recipe was complete. 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called critics probably thought I was over the hill, but I knew I'd be 
back," Blyleven said. "They said my career was over, but they don't know. Only 
I know. The American League hitters will tell me when my career is over. Not 
they." 
</P>
<P>
One Sunday last season, a clubhouse attendant brought a few dozen donuts for 
the players. When they arrived, each donut had one bite taken out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who? 
</P>
<P>
At Boston, Angel utility man Glenn Hoffman thought it would be funny to stick a 
live lobster in Blyleven's bag. Blyleven took the prank a step further, 
bringing the lobster aboard the plane and putting it in Port's briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
When the team arrived in Milwaukee, Blyleven decided to crunch the crustacean. 
So he stuck it under the wheel of the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven's idea of a joke is to light someone's shoes (known as a hotfoot), 
fill a teammate's towel with shaving cream, throw a firecracker into a cluster 
of unsuspecting reporters, hide a small explosive in Manager Doug Rader's 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just spontaneous," Blyleven said. "I don't sit around and think about it, 
things just happen. People in general leave themselves open to practical 
jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his curveball, Blyleven brought a refreshing dose of levity to an 
Angel clubhouse that most often resembled a dentist's waiting room in past 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But with the switch to Rader, a proponent of the loose clubhouse, players such 
as Blyleven had free rein. 
</P>
<P>
"It has helped because you come to the park knowing it's going to be a lot of 
fun," Angel pitcher Willie Fraser said. "Before, you knew what to expect, and 
it was the same thing all the time. It didn't help team morale to keep guys in 
closets, and that's more or less what happened. It got monotonous. Now, that 
doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Rader, for one, appreciates Blyleven's humor. 
</P>
<P>
"What guys like him help maintain throughout difficult times during the season 
is incalculable," Rader said. "It's a major, major plus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Not-So-Perfect Angel 
</P>
<P>
While Blyleven has done wonders for clubhouse camaraderie, his methods can 
leave outsiders cold. Offensive language, offensive gestures and offensive 
bodily functions are all part of Blyleven's shtick. 
</P>
<P>
As Angel pitcher Jim Abbott joked, "There were some sights, sounds and smells 
that came out of his area that weren't always that pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Even his wife, Patty, admits Bert can get pretty gross. 
</P>
<P>
"One time I came home and Bert was teaching the kids to pick their nose and 
flick it," Patty said. "I said, 'Oh my God, you're their father!' " 
</P>
<P>
His teammates laugh these things off. "That's Bert," they say. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone laughs. Blyleven has been known to give reporters, especially 
women, a difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a firm believer that women should not be in a man's clubhouse," Blyleven 
said. "I realize they have a job to do, but what I've seen is a lot of women 
reporters hanging around. I know a lot of women would be upset with that, but 
that's how I feel. If it offends them, well, it offends them." 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect Blyleven to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he offends a lot of people, that's just the way he is," Angel catcher 
Lance Parrish said. "I don't think he gives it a second thought. His objective 
isn't to offend anyone, it's just to be himself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sure Thing 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on his career, Blyleven, who will make about $1.2 million this 
season, sees one thing. "Just consistency." 
</P>
<P>
It's the common thread through his 20 years in the major leagues. Blyleven's 
record may vary by year, but his ERA is usually under 3.50. It has gone above 
4.00 four times. 
</P>
<P>
His career strikeout-to-walk ratio is almost 3-to-1, and he has averaged fewer 
than two walks per start. He has averaged 7 1/3 innings per start and has a 
271-231 career record. Even when he gave up all those home runs in 1986 and 
'87, Blyleven had winning records. 
</P>
<P>
He has had only one major injury, a muscle tear in his right elbow that caused 
him to miss most of the 1982 season. He has spent only four other weeks on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The teams surrounding him weren't always that good -- remember, Blyleven played 
in Texas and Cleveland -- but he usually was. Give him the ball and he'll keep 
your team in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven wastes little motion on the mound. Almost as soon as he gets the ball 
back from his catcher, he's set to start his windup. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's Chris Berman calls him Bert (Be Home) Blyleven, and the nickname is 
appropriate. When Blyleven pitches, his teammates usually can be home in time 
for the 11 o'clock highlights. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work fast -- it keeps my defense alive," Blyleven said. "My 
concentration level isn't that high when I'm standing there thinking. I can't 
think, so I have to just get the ball and throw." 
</P>
<P>
Another Blyleven staple: his unwavering mental approach to the game. He doesn't 
sulk after losses and he doesn't get too excited after victories. Port calls 
him the ultimate professional, and believes other pitchers can learn from him. 
</P>
<P>
"When he doesn't win, he allows himself five to 10 minutes of disconsolation, 
and then he's back at it, preparing for his next start," Port said. "I think 
the fellows who see that come away with a lesson that, after a tough outing, 
you don't have to pine about it for four or five days." 
</P>

Added Parrish: "He's been winning and losing in the big leagues for 20 years, 
and he has one of the better attitudes I've ever seen. Nothing affects him." 
</P>

The Natural 
</P>
<P>
No one taught Blyleven the curveball. There were no instructional videos, no 
clinics, no extensive coaching. One day he just picked up a ball, threw it and 
it broke. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always there," Blyleven said of the curve. "It was just a matter of me 
finding it." 
</P>
<P>
To refine the pitch, Blyleven went to Dodger Stadium and studied Sandy Koufax 
and Don Drysdale. Many of his childhood years were spent sneaking into Anaheim 
Stadium but, unlike most kids, Blyleven wasn't an autograph hound. 
</P>
<P>
"Every opportunity I could, I went there to watch pitchers pitch," Blyleven 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His father, who moved the family from Holland to Canada and then to Southern 
California by the time Bert was five, built his son a mound in the backyard of 
their Garden Grove home. 
</P>
<P>
A year after he graduated from Santiago High School, Blyleven was a 19-year-old 
rookie with the Minnesota Twins, helping the team win the 1970 AL West title. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me grow up real quick," Blyleven said. "But I knew I belonged in the 
major leagues even at the young age of 19," 
</P>
<P>
He never went back to the minors. Blyleven spent seven years with the Twins 
before moving to Texas; Pittsburgh, where he helped the Pirates win the 1979 
World Series; Cleveland; back to Minnesota, where he helped the Twins win the 
1987 world championship, and to California. 
</P>
<P>
The uniforms changed, the reputation remained the same: Blyleven had one of the 
best curveballs in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the curveball is a lost art today," Blyleven said. "More pitchers are 
going to sliders, split-fingered fastballs, more off-speed stuff. You don't see 
a lot of young kids throwing curveballs." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven sees plenty of young kids, though. He broke in with the likes of Carl 
Yastrzemski and Frank Howard, and now he's playing with guys who probably 
collected Blyleven's baseball card when they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no rocking chair by his clubhouse cubicle, and no one calls him Old 
Man Bert. 
</P>
<P>
"If they did, I'd blow their houses up," Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Curve, Will Travel 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven may have Hall-of-Fame credentials, but when thoughts turn to the great 
pitchers of his time, names such as Seaver and Ryan come up -- not usually 
Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven is the great curveball pitcher who has played for a lot of marginal 
teams, the restless righthander who never stayed in one place too long. 
</P>
<P>
After his first seven years at Minnesota, Blyleven felt he was underpaid and 
threatened to become a free agent in 1976. The Twins traded him to Texas, where 
Blyleven spent two seasons before being traded to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven helped the Pirates win the 1979 world championship, but he had 
differences with manager Chuck Tanner. Blyleven, who had 20 no-decisions in 
1979, felt Tanner pulled his starters from games too early. 
</P>
<P>
So it was on to Cleveland, where Blyleven spent five seasons. But by 1984, it 
was obvious the Indians were opting for a youth movement, and Blyleven wanted 
no part of it. He asked to be traded. Wish granted. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Minnesota and helped the Twins win the 1987 World Series. He was 
hoping to end his career in Minnesota but ran into more contractual problems 
and wound up in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
There were times the outspoken Blyleven came off sounding like a malcontent, 
but he insists he was unhappy in only one place -- Pittsburgh. And while all 
the moves might have hurt his reputation, Blyleven says it helped his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Trades often help you because they give you a new determination," Blyleven 
said. "Not only to show the new club they made the right move but to show the 
team that traded you that they made a mistake. That comes with pride." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Father Like Son 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of Blyleven's four children, Todd, is a senior pitcher at Villa Park 
High School who already has a pretty good curveball. Bert taught him the pitch, 
along with a few other tricks of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Todd pulled his first hotfoot on his Connie Mack League coach and 
a few shaving-cream pranks on some teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my boy," Bert said. 
</P>
<P>
Bert is just another one of the boys in the Blyleven house. Patty Blyleven 
often teases Bert, telling friends she has five children -- three sons, a 
daughter and Bert. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always either burping or passing gas or doing something," Todd said of 
his father. "He's always fun to have around. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at friends who have these dads who are older, who are kind of serious 
and work and stuff, but I come home to a Dad I can joke around with, who acts 
your age. It's been like that as long as I can remember. He's always been a big 
kid."
