Alabama, the country-rock group whose 21 consecutive No. 1 singles include 
"Feels So Right," "The Closer You Get," "Roll On" and "You've Got the Touch," 
was named artist of the decade at the 24th Academy of Country Music Awards 
show. The other contenders were Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson 
and groups the Statler Brothers and the Oak Ridge Boys. K.T. Oslin won this 
year's best-album award for "This Woman." Oslin also was named best female 
vocalist at the awards show, which was broadcast on NBC-TV from Walt Disney 
Studios in Burbank. Another double winner was Hank Williams Jr. He collected 
his third consecutive entertainer-of-the-year award and also won in the best 
video category for his "Young Country." George Strait was named top male 
vocalist. Highway 101 was named top vocal group for the second year in a row. 
Mother and daughter Naomi and Wynona Judd won as best vocal duo for the fifth 
time. Kathy Mattea's ballad of the road, "Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses" 
was named both top song and best single of the year. The pioneer award went to 
veteran star Buck Owens for his longtime contribution to country music. 
President Bush, a country music fan, made a videotaped appearance, noting the 
values and American pride reflected in the songs. The Academy of Country 
Music's 2,000 voting members cast ballots to choose the winners of the cowboy 
hat-shaped awards in 11 categories.

 -- If the name Antonio Meucci doesn't ring a bell, you haven't come across 
John N. LaCorte and his mission to draw attention to Meucci's accomplishments. 
LaCorte believes that Meucci -- not Alexander Graham Bell -- deserves 
recognition for inventing the telephone. He has already convinced some people 
and gathered about 250 friends and supporters in Brooklyn to pay tribute to 
Meucci, an Italian-American inventor who, in 1871, filed notice of intent to 
seek a patent for a device that would transmit speech sounds via electricity. 
But Meucci did not have enough money to develop the project and his document 
with the U.S. Patent Office lapsed, LaCorte said. It was five years later that 
Bell applied for his own patent. This is not the first time that LaCorte, 79, 
has worked to gain recognition for an Italian. As president of the Italian 
Historical Society of America more than two decades ago, he sought 
acknowledgment of Giovanni da Verrazano for his exploration of New York harbor, 
and officials subsequently named the bridge spanning the harbor's entrance the 
Verrazano Narrows Bridge. SHIRLEY MARLOW

Iran released 70 disabled and sick Iraqi prisoners of war as a gesture of good 
will to mark the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Islamic republic, 
the official IRNA news agency reported. All but four of the POWs later arrived 
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad aboard a jet chartered by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross. IRNA said the four who refused to board the plane 
were granted asylum in Iran. The Iranian news agency said that while Iran has 
released 1,346 disabled Iraqi prisoners in several stages since the Aug. 20 
cease-fire, Iraq has freed only 949 Iranian POWs.

ATHLETICS SHOW ANGELS A FLASHBACK, 4-0; 
</P>
<P>
WELCH ALLOWS THREE HITS OVER EIGHT INNINGS IN OAKLAND VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There are reasons why the Angels finished 29 games behind the Oakland Athletics 
last season, and in case the Angels had forgotten, Monday night's 4-0 loss to 
the A's at Anaheim Stadium caught them up very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The A's brought with them these reminders: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitching: Oakland starter Bob Welch retired the first nine batters he 
faced, yielded two harmless hits in the fourth inning and then retired 11 more 
Angels in succession, finally settling for an eight-inning three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hitting: The A's led, 3-0, after four innings, with Mark McGwire driving in 
his 10th run of the season in the first inning, Walt Weiss knocking in his 
fifth in the second inning and Glenn Hubbard hitting his first Anaheim Stadium 
home run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fielding: Subtitle this one Comedy Tonight. Angel right fielder Claudell 
Washington lost one ball in the lights, and had another momentarily pop out of 
his glove, but his juggling act merely warmed up the audience for Angel pitcher 
Chuck Finley's fifth-inning pratfall, soon to become a staple on This Week in 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The bouncing ball was set in motion by the bat of Oakland's Felix Jose, the 
rookie currently replacing that other Jose in right field. The ball glanced off 
Finley's hip and skittered toward the first-base side of the mound, with Finley 
bare-handing the ball and belly-flopping on the infield grass. 
</P>
<P>
As he fell, Finley tried to underhand the ball to Angel first baseman Wally 
Joyner. A low-flying pigeon would have had a better chance at the ball. 
Finley's lob soared 20 feet over Joyner's head and landed 30 feet beyond first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Felix wound up on second base . . . and the Finley Flop was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine we'll get to see that one again," Angel Manager Doug Rader said with 
a smile. "I wish I would've had my stopwatch on it. I didn't get the hang time 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Jose was later thrown out attempting to steal third base and Finley struck out 
Stan Javier to close out the inning, so, for the Angels, no real damage had 
been done. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier innings took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
Finley (1-1) served up a first-inning double to Dave Henderson and McGwire's 
run-scoring single to forge an instant 1-0 deficit. It was soon 2-0, just as 
soon as Washington lost a routine fly by Hubbard in the lights. 
</P>
<P>
With Carney Lansford on first with none out in the second inning, Hubbard 
lofted a ball to mid-right field, with Washington hanging back in deep right 
field. The ball plopped down in front of Washington for a single and, two outs 
later, Lansford scored on a single by Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
In the third inning, Washington bobbled another easy fly by Terry Steinbach, 
letting the ball squirt out of the glove's webbing before grabbing it with a 
second snatch. 
</P>
<P>
That was another rerun for the Angels, who watched Chili Davis re-invent the 
position of right field with a club-record 19 errors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Faces change, gloves change, too, but right field at Anaheim Stadium remains as 
vexed as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard he cursed it," Washington said, tossing a needle Davis' way. 
</P>
<P>
Washington responded good-naturedly to the fans' Bronx cheers when he began 
catching balls the old-fashioned way from the fourth inning on, doffing his cap 
as he returned to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a little gesture," Washington said with a shrug. "You have those days 
some times. It was just a rough day at the office." 
</P>
<P>
Washington was one of three Angels to manage hits against Welch (2-0). He 
singled in the eighth inning, after Brian Downing doubled and Devon White 
singled in the fourth. Neither Downing nor White scored, however, with Welch 
striking out Joyner and Davis to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, the Angels failed to advance another runner beyond first base. 
With Oakland reliever Eric Plunk retiring the Angels in order in the ninth 
inning, A's pitchers faced just 30 hitters -- three over the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"We had chances to crawl back into the ballgame," Rader said. "The fact we 
didn't do anything offensively gives the air that nothing was going on for us. 
If there's no activity on the bases, it's going to look like you're dead. It 
creates the impression of an overall malaise." 
</P>
<P>
Rader thought his pitchers fared well enough, at least in the act of pitching 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we threw a very nice ballgame," Rader said. "When you can limit an 
offense like that to four one-run innings, that should at least put you in 
position to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
By game's end, Johnny Ray was given company on the Angels' disabled list. 
Reserve outfielder Tony Armas was placed on the 15-day list when the hamstring 
injury he incurred Sunday was diagnosed as a second-degree strain. "When you 
have the feeling like somebody's stuck an ice pick in there, it tends to be 
symptomatic of something more than just a cramp," Angel trainer Rick Smith 
said. "This is something that's going to take longer than a few days." To take 
Armas' place on the 24-man roster, the Angels purchased the contract of 
outfielder Brian Brady from their triple-A affiliate in Edmonton. Brady, who 
spent time in the Angels' spring camp, was batting .167 (one for six) in two 
games with the Trappers. . . . The A's lost first baseman Mark McGwire to 
injury Monday, although his condition is considerably less serious. After 
singling in the first inning and striking out in the third, McGwire was removed 
from the game because of a lower back strain. He was replaced in the lineup by 
Stan Javier, with third baseman Carney Lansford moving to first. 
</P>
<P>
Even on the disabled list, and even when he isn't driving, Jose Canseco finds a 
way to stir things up. Monday, Canseco's arrival at Anaheim Stadium created 
minor havoc among parking lot security guards when the car he was riding in 
failed to stop at the players' entrance gate. The car, driven by a friend, ran 
the gate and didn't stop until frantic security guards flagged it down. Canseco 
claimed not to have seen any attendant at the gate -- the attendant was 
apparently inside the entrance kiosk -- and saw no harm in forging ahead. "I 
didn't think there was anything wrong with that," he said. It was later 
explained to Canseco that identification needs to be displayed at the gate, 
even if you happen to be the American League's reigning most valuable player. . 
. . Add Canseco: His return to the Oakland lineup could be as much as another 
month away. Canseco said he expects to have the cast removed from his left 
wrist April 20, then undergo a week of rehabilitation, then start hitting off a 
tee for three or four days and then join the A's double-A farm club in 
Huntsville, Ala., to hit against live pitching for a few games. That could 
delay Canseco's first Oakland at-bat of 1989 until early May. He has already 
missed 16 days because of the injury.

MURRAY PUTS GRAND FINISH TO DODGERS 7-4 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Murray, who always thought the San Francisco Giants never gave his 
brother, Rich, much of a chance when he was here, got his first chance to exact 
a measure of familial revenge Monday night, and made it a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who failed to get the ball out of the infield in his first four trips 
to the plate and was 2 for 25 (.080) as a National Leaguer, crushed a 
tiebreaking grand slam off San Francisco reliever Mike LaCoss in the ninth 
inning, lifting the Dodgers to a 7-4 victory and spoiling the Giants' home 
opener before a crowd of 53,015 in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's home run, which came on a 1-and-1 pitch and landed deep into the 
right-field seats, followed a bases-loaded error by Giant first baseman Will 
Clark that enabled the Dodgers to tie the score, 3-3. It also was the 15th 
grand slam of his career, more than any other active major leaguer, and raised 
his lifetime batting average with the bases loaded to .416 (62 for 149). 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is one way he built his reputation as a clutch hitter, the 
reason the Dodgers acquired him from the Baltimore Orioles last winter. This 
was dividend No. 1 on that trade, and also provided win No. 1 of 1989 for 
pitcher Orel Hershiser, who struck out 10 in eight innings but was in danger of 
becoming a two-time loser until the Dodgers' five-run rally in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that was basically it," Murray said in a postgame interview, when asked 
if he had been trying too hard. "I wanted to do well so bad, you can add a lot 
of pressure on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, however, said that his teammates told him this would be his night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of time," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants got one run back in the bottom of the ninth when they loaded the 
bases against one Dodger reliever, Jay Howell, and another reliever, Alejandro 
Pena, balked a run home. But Clark, with a chance to atone for his error, took 
a called third strike from Pena, ending the game. 
</P>
<P>
The home run by Murray, whose brother had brief trials with the Giants in 1980 
and 1983, was the Dodgers' third of the game. It came after earlier bases-empty 
home runs by Mike Marshall, his first of the season, and Kirk Gibson, his 
second. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers trailed, 3-2, entering the ninth, but Mike Scioscia opened the 
inning with a leadoff single off Giant reliever Atlee Hammaker, who departed 
for LaCoss. Mickey Hatcher, pinch-hitting for Hershiser, followed with a weak 
ground ball just out of the reach of third baseman Chris Speier for a hit, 
sending pinch-runner Mariano Duncan to third. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw where Speier was playing, I knew it had a chance because I knew he 
would have to dive for the ball," Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph then drew a walk, loading the bases. Franklin Stubbs, batting 
for Alfredo Griffin, followed with a sharp grounder up the middle that second 
baseman Robby Thompson gloved and turned into a force play at the plate with a 
tough throw across his body. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson then hit the grounder that Clark botched, allowing pinch-runner Dave 
Anderson to score. Clark said he took one step toward second but intended to go 
to the plate until the ball bounced off his glove. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had jumped on Hershiser for four hits and two runs in the first 
inning, when only the plate-blocking skills of Scioscia kept the inning from 
being a bigger horror. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser threw another scare into the Dodgers in the second inning, when the 
man with the $7.9-million arm felt some pain on a 1-1 pitch to Don Robinson, 
the Giants' pitcher. Griffin's visit to the mound prompted trainer Bill Buhler 
and Lasorda to rush to Hershiser, but after he threw two test pitches, he 
decided to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little twinge in my arm," Hershiser said. "It was tough to warm up in 
the cold and with the (opening) ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfredo heard me yell, 'What was that?' It was a little demonstration on my 
part, but after testing it I said, 'I'll be all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have been hurting too badly, because he struck out the side in the 
second and did it again in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Both games I've pitched this season, I've thrown the ball well at times, but 
very inconsistent," said Hershiser, who allowed six hits and walked five. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go from battling them in one inning to striking out the side." 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, the Giants broke a 2-2 tie on a sacrifice fly by pinch- hitter 
Ernest Riles. Clark lined a single to open the inning and Kevin Mitchell, who 
had doubled home a run in the first, walked on a full count. Candy Maldonado 
bunted the runners over, and Riles -- sent to the plate for Matt Williams, who 
had hit a grand slam the day before but had struck out twice against Hershiser 
-- stroked a liner to left that drove Gibson back to the track. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Hershiser walked the leadoff batter, Speier, but spared himself 
further trouble by knocking down Thompson's wicked liner up the middle and 
turning it into a force play. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hershiser beat the Giants four times last season, this wasn't the 
first time he has been roughed up here. He lasted just two innings and gave up 
eight runs in a 15-4 loss here last Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Hershiser, your 59 innings stunk," yelled one fan, leaning over the 
tunnel leading to the visitors' clubhouse before the game, in a reference to 
Hershiser's record scoreless inning streak last season. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser laughed about it then, and tipped his cap to the fans who greeted him 
with a crescendo of boos during pregame introductions. Lasorda, of course, 
received a similar reception and naturally relished the moment, bowing deeply 
and blowing kisses. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players in our meeting before the game that whatever they do, don't 
react to anything the crowd does," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was welcomed rudely by Robinson's first pitch in the second inning, an 
inside fastball that put him on his back. But the Dodger right fielde-r, a 
Candlestick villain since pointing into the Giants' dugout after a home run two 
years ago, responded with a vengeance, powering his first home run of the 
season over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson tied the score with two out in the fifth, driving Robinson's first pitch 
over the fence in right. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, losers of 12 of 18 games to the Dodgers last season, got to 
Hershiser quickly in the first. Thompson singled to right, Clark singled to 
center, and Mitchell's fly ball to right fell behind Marshall for a double, 
scoring Thompson. After Maldonado fouled out, Terry Kennedy lashed a single to 
right, scoring Clark, but Scioscia stopped Mitchell's progress cold with a body 
block helped in great measure by Marshall's perfect one-hop throw. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Until Mike Marshall's second-inning home run, the fourth, fifth and sixth 
hitters in the Dodger order -- Eddie Murray, Marshall and John Shelby -- had no 
home runs and no RBIs in a total of 48 at-bats. Kirk Gibson, with five RBIs, 
started the night with more RBIs than the rest of the starting lineup combined. 
. . . Tim Belcher, who pitched the season opener in Cincinnati and lost, will 
pitch the home opener for the Dodgers Thursday afternoon against the Houston 
Astros. . . . When Giant catcher Terry Kennedy stole second base while Dodger 
catcher Mike Scioscia was arguing whether the pitch was a foul tip, it was his 
first stolen base since June 24, 1987, and the fifth of his career in 1,194 
games. . . . Among the measures the Giants have taken to make Candlestick Park 
less susceptible to the type of rowdiness it has become notorious for: more 
security guards, trained at the San Francisco Police Academy; a family seating 
section; stricter guidelines for the purchase of alcohol; computerized system 
to identify repeat offenders; 700 employees trained in an alcohol management 
supervised by big-league baseball. There are numerous signs throughout the 
ballpark bearing such messages as: "We want you safe because we want you back."

PITINO FINDS SLUMPING KNICKS ARE A TEAM IN TURMOIL AS PLAYERS BICKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam McManis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York tabloids have resurrected a catchy phrase to describe the suddenly 
slumping New York Knicks, a nickname previously reserved primarily for the New 
York Yankees: "Team Turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
It is a nickname that seems to fit. 
</P>
<P>
After the Knicks' 10-point loss to the New Jersey Nets Friday night, Coach Rick 
Pitino strongly criticized his players and promised changes. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who still lead the Atlantic Division by 6 1/2 games over the 
second-place Philadelphia 76ers, lost eight of 13 games and were entangled in a 
net of inner-conflicts. A summation of the squabbles: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gerald Wilkins had a shouting match with Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kiki Vandeweghe was said to be shut out of the offense by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forward Charles Oakley was upset that Vandeweghe has cut into his playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ditto for Johnny Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rookie Rod Strickland continued to be upset about his bit part as Jackson's 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss to the Nets, Pitino had had enough. He threatened to bench 
Jackson, Oakley and Newman. And he questioned the attitude and talent of his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do away with reputations," Pitino told Newsday Friday night. "We will 
rock this boat. I've been conscious of egos, because we have a lot of fragile 
egos. This is not panic time, but we have to get ready for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our heads don't match our play. We have an over-inflated opinion of 
ourselves. We're going to have to face the music." 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks held a team meeting Saturday that lasted so long they missed their 
flight to Washington. Players aired their grievances. Pitino reiterated his 
gripes. And, apparently, an understanding was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino's threats turned out to be merely a scare tactic. But they worked. The 
Knicks recovered Sunday to edge the Washington Bullets, who lately have been 
tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
So, all is right with the Knicks, who are close to clinching their first 
division title since 1970-71. 
</P>
<P>
Selfishness, Part I: Since switching to point guard for the Chicago Bulls, 
Michael Jordan has become statistic conscious. He has started checking with 
statisticians to see how close he is to a triple-double. He had a string of 
seven consecutive triple-doubles broken Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys at the scorer's desk let me know what I need," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, do the Bulls' assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep reminding me when I get back to the huddle," Jordan said. "They say, 
'You need three more of this. You need four more of that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is trying to win over voters for the league's most valuable player 
award. 
</P>
<P>
"If the way I'm playing now doesn't convince them I'm a complete player, then I 
guess nothing will," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Selfishness, Part II: The underachieving Atlanta Hawks have apparently found 
their culprit -- guard Reggie Theus. 
</P>
<P>
Theus has a reputation as a selfish player and things haven't changed at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that opinion was expressed by several unnamed Hawk players, and a 
former assistant coach, in a recent story in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"Reggie is the worst thing that has happened to us all year," one player said. 
</P>
<P>
Said another: "For a while, I'd just thought he'd lost his game. But now, I can 
see it's just Reggie." 
</P>
<P>
And former assistant Brendan Suhr, now in a similar job with the Detroit 
Pistons, said the Hawks made a mistake in acquiring Theus from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a disaster," Suhr said. "Reggie told us he'd submerge himself in our 
system because he only wanted to win at this stage in his career to prove he 
was not a loser. Obviously, he didn't mean it. Or, he's just kidding himself." 
</P>
<P>
In defense, Theus said: "It's a very difficult adjustment, to find a rhythm 
when you only see the ball two or three times in a sequence. . . . If you ask 
negative questions, you can often get negative responses." 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle SuperSonics ended a seven-game losing streak with a victory over 
the Dallas Mavericks Saturday night, which might temporarily soothe the temper 
of Coach Bernie Bickerstaff.

After losing to the Lakers Tuesday at Seattle, Bickerstaff yelled so loudly at 
his team that he could be heard down a long corridor. Two nights later, after 
losing to Phoenix, the SuperSonics had lost seven of their last 15 home games 
after winning 17 in a row at one point. Bickerstaff did more than just bark. He 
benched power forward Michael Cage and replaced him with Xavier McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Seattle Times, Bickerstaff could be heard screaming at Cage 
after he allowed A.C. Green to score a career-high 33 points: "You say you've 
got guys covered, and you don't have them covered at all. What do you know 
about defense?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Cage about his benching: "I've got to make sure I don't distance or 
alienate myself from the team, which could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Cage is not the SuperSonics' only problem, however. 
</P>
<P>
"So many things are wrong, I can't put my finger on it," Bickerstaff said. 
"Maybe I need my toes, too." 
</P>
<P>
The craziest game of the week had to be Friday night's battle royal at Chicago 
Stadium between the Bulls and the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons won, 114-112, in overtime of a game that had a fight between Isiah 
Thomas and the Bulls' Bill Cartwright, five players fouling out, including 
Jordan and Joe Dumars. Chicago Coach Doug Collins was close to tears after 
almost attacking the referees. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons may have won the game, but the loss of Thomas even for a short time 
obviously will hurt. Thomas said he did not know how he fractured his left hand 
in the brawl, although he landed several punches and fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Why would Thomas, at 6-foot-1, take on Cartwright, who is 7-1? 
</P>
<P>
"We've played the Bulls six times this year and Cartwright has hit me five 
times," said Thomas, who was fined $5,000 and suspended for two games for 
initiating the fight. Cartwright was fined $2,500 and received a one-game 
suspension. "I stole the basketball from him, and he hit me. I pushed him and 
was about to turn away when he rushed me." 
</P>
<P>
There is a history to the Thomas-Cartwright confrontation. On Jan. 31, Thomas 
needed six stitches to close a cut over his right eye after Cartwright elbowed 
him.

STIEB'S 1-HITTER LEAVES YANKEES FEELING WORSE

After the New York Yankees lost to the Cleveland Indians Saturday, Manager 
Dallas Green said, "We stink." 
</P>
<P>
He knows what he is talking about. After losing to the Indians again Sunday, 
Green probably thought things couldn't get worse, but they did. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb pitched a one-hitter Monday night and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the 
Yankees, 8-0, dropping New York to 1-6, its worst start since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at Yankee Stadium was announced as 17,192. Fewer than 5,000 were left 
when the game ended. And most of those people were yelling at the home team. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a fan, I'd be booing, too," Green said. "In fact, I'm booing from 
the dugout, but they can't hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Stieb, who closed last year with consecutive one-hitters, has three in his last 
four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no secret to it," said Stieb, hit only by Jamie Quirk's solid single 
with one out in the fifth inning. "I'm getting all of my pitches over and they 
got me a lot of runs, and that usually means a victory." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Barfield, Fred McGriff and Lloyd Moseby hit home runs for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Cleveland 2 -- Nick Esasky hit a home run in his Fenway Park debut 
and Wade Boggs keyed rallies with two singles in the Red Sox's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker (1-0) allowed no runs and two hits in five innings. Mike 
Smithson relieved after a two-run homer by Joe Carter in the sixth and finished 
for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Milwaukee 4 -- Ruben Sierra doubled home the go-ahead run in the 10th 
inning as the Rangers spoiled the Brewers' home opener. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra's hit off Chuck Crim (0-1) came after a walk to Rafael Palmeiro. Cecil 
Espy hit a single to drive in the final run for the Rangers, who won for the 
fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
The victory went to Jeff Russell (1-0), who struck out Robin Yount with two on 
and two out in the bottom of the ninth and then retired the Brewers in order in 
the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia tied the score for the Rangers with a two-run home run off 
Chris Bosio in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
After Scott Fletcher hit a single in the first, Palmeiro hit his first American 
League homer to give Texas a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Brewers rallied with four runs in the second off Charlie Hough, who 
allowed three hits and three walks in the inning before being replaced by Brad 
Arnsberg. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Deer led off with his second homer to cut the deficit to 2-1. After Hough 
walked Glenn Braggs and Bill Spiers, Jim Gantner drove in the tying run with a 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Hough, who has lost nine consecutive decisions to the Brewers, walked Mike 
Felder to load the bases. B.J. Surhoff hit a single to right, scoring Spiers 
and Gantner to make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Arnsberg came in and got Yount to fly out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Baltimore 0 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched a three-hitter at Kansas 
City, leading the Royals to their 14th consecutive victory over the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City hasn't lost to Baltimore since July 26, 1987, when the Orioles beat 
the Royals and Saberhagen, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen became the first Royal starter to get a victory this season. He 
struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore rookie Pete Harnisch allowed seven hits and walked five in 7 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Wilson, who missed two games with with a strained Achilles' tendon, 
scored the Royals' first run after he singled leading off the first and took 
third on Kevin Seitzer's single. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Tartabull, who sat out a game with a bruised heel suffered in a collision 
Saturday, drove in Wilson with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 6, Chicago 5 -- Dave Valle tripled off an overhead speaker in the 
Kingdome to drive in the go-ahead run in a three-run seventh inning and the 
Mariners held on to beat the White Sox in their home opener. 
</P>
<P>
Valle's pinch-hit off Ken Patterson was headed for the left-center field stands 
when it hit one of the six speakers suspended from the ceiling, 132 feet above 
the field. Valle, trying for an inside-the-park homer, was thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Vizquel then walked, stole second and scored when Harold Reynolds singled 
for a 5-3 lead. Ken Griffey Jr. walked and Alvin Davis singled to score 
Reynolds.

HURST STRIKES OUT 13 IN HIS FIRST 1-HITTER

<P>
Bruce Hurst pitched a one-hitter -- allowing only a two-run home run by Lonnie 
Smith -- and struck out 13 Monday night to lead the Padres to a 5-2 victory 
over the Atlanta Braves at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Carmelo Martinez and Garry Templeton each hit home runs during a four-run sixth 
inning to support the first one-hitter of Hurst's 10-year career. The 
left-hander has struck out 10 or more 14 times. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst (1-1) retired the first two batters in the third inning before allowing 
his only walk, to losing pitcher Pete Smith, and delivering Lonnie Smith's 
first home run of the year on an 0-and-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, who was hammered for nine hits and seven earned runs by San Francisco in 
his National League debut last week, retired the final 19 Braves in a row, 
striking out nine along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst threw 100 pitches, 72 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Smith (0-1) worked 5 1/3 innings and allowed eight hits and all the Padre runs. 
The right-hander struck out seven and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves held their 2-0 lead until the bottom of the fourth when Tony Gwynn 
lined a home run to right to pull San Diego within 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Jack Clark and John Kruk opened with singles. Martinez, who went 
into the game with only one hit in 18 at-bats, hammered a 2-and-1 delivery deep 
into the left-field seats for a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Templeton hit a home run to right. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 8, Houston 3 -- Eric Davis' three-run home run highlighted the Reds' 
four-run fifth inning and Tom Browning earned his 18th victory in 20 decisions 
in the game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knepper's record dropped to 0-2. Last season, the Astro left-hander did not 
lose consecutive starts en route to a 14-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Oester of the Reds walked to start the fifth, was balked to second and 
moved to third on a sacrifice by Browning. Barry Larkin's single to left field 
scored Oester and, after Kal Daniels singled, Davis hit a home run over the 
center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Glenn Davis singled and scored on Kevin Bass' double. 
Davis hit his second homer of the season in the fourth and doubled home Billy 
Hatcher from second in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds added three runs in the ninth on run-scoring singles by Todd Benzinger 
and Oester and Paul O'Neill's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Browning (2-0) has lost only two decisions since last June 6. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 7, Montreal 6 -- Von Hayes led off the ninth with his second home 
run of the game to give the Phillies the victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fitzgerald also hit two home runs for the Expos, the second giving 
Montreal a 5-5 tie in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal took a 6-5 lead in the seventh when reliever Jeff Parrett walked 
pinch-hitter Wallace Johnson with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
But the Phillies tied it in the bottom of the inning on a leadoff single by Bob 
Dernier, a walk to Hayes, a sacrifice and a wild pitch by Greg Harris.

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: BURNHAM AND MILLER GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER IN FAST 
LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The rivalry between Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa and Inger Miller of 
Pasadena Muir opened a new chapter Saturday night at the Arcadia Invitational. 
Burnham got her first victory of the season over Miller in the 200 meters, only 
after losing in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Burnham was the nation's top prep sprinter as a junior, while 
going undefeated against Miller. This season, however, the Muir junior holds a 
2-1 edge, having defeated Burnham in the 100 meters at the Northridge Relays in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has the best times in the 100 (11.59) and 200 meters (23.62) in the 
nation this season, with Burnham holding the second-best marks (11.64 and 
23.63). 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rivalry, both sprinters downplay any conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"Inger is a very nice person, who is not up there," Burnham said while holding 
her right hand above her head. "We are both competitors who want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Miller feels the same toward Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
"Angela wants to win as much as I do, it is just the competition," Miller said. 
"Over the summer, we were in different age groups but ran in the same meets and 
we spoke to each other at times. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not speak before our races, but no one really does. I am always nervous 
before a race, so I do not speak at all anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Said Burnham: "I do not see it as a big rivalry. Win or lose, I have nothing to 
complain about because I just go out there and run my best." 
</P>
<P>
After losing to Miller twice, Burnham tried discredit her loses as motivation 
for her victory over Miller in the 200 at Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I did not have any extra motivation to win," Burnham said. "I just tried 
to relax and run my best race and not because I had to prove anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely did not expect to run this fast so early," said Burnham, who ran 
11.28 and 23.45 in the 100 and 200 meters last season. "I guess the competition 
has helped put that little spark back into my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The first official day for high school basketball seniors to sign national 
letters of intent is Wednesday, but Tracy Murray of Glendora, the state career 
and single season scoring record-holder, announced Sunday after weeks of 
indecision that he will attend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora Coach Mike LeDuc, who led the Tartans to State Division II final, is 
pleased with Murray's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his choice is a great one because UCLA has such a fine tradition with 
its academic and athletic programs," LeDuc said. "I am sure that he will make 
local people really happy." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Murray made his college decision over the weekend, other prep seniors 
were playing in all-star games trying to impress college scouts. 
</P>
<P>
One player who has not decided is Terry Cannon of Crenshaw, City 4-A Division 
player of the year. He was the star of the sixth annual Southern California 
All-Star prep basketball game at Cal State Dominguez Hills last Friday night, 
scoring 28 points, to lead the City boys team to a 108-99 victory over the 
Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1 Cannon, who in March led the Cougars to the City 4-A division 
title and their fourth state title, dominated play as he led the City to its 
fourth victory in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon impressed college scouts with his ball-handling and outside shooting, 
making four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Other top City performers were Westchester forward Renaud Gordon, who scored 14 
points, 12 coming in the second half, and Maurice McKinzy of Fremont, who 
scored 11. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Southern Section was John Hardy of Rolling Hills, who 
impressed scouts while playing as a shooting guard. The 6-4 Hardy, who played 
forward this season, was his team's top scorer with 14 points, with Malru 
Dottin of Santa Ana Saddleback and Brian Camper of Lakewood each scoring 13. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' all-star matchup, the Southern Section routed the City, 97-54, 
with four players scoring in double figures. Heidi Burge of Palos Verdes and 
Susan Peters of Los Altos had 14 and 13 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dapper Dan game in Pittsburgh, Arizona-bound Ed Stokes of Playa del Rey 
St. Bernard scored 13 points and USC-bound Harold Miner of Inglewood added 12, 
for the West all-star team in its 96-84 loss to the East last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
In last week's Southern Section baseball poll, Lakewood of the Moore League, 
with pitcher Chris Miller and catcher Keith Tripp, topped the 5-A Division 
rankings, ahead of Riverside Poly and Simi Valley. In the 4-A division, Newhall 
Hart, with catcher Casey Burrill, earned the top ranking ahead of Cerritos. 
Artesia, behind the pitching of returning All Southern Section selection Joel 
Adamson, is the top team in the 3-A Division. . . . In the boys' team tennis 
poll, Beverly Hills was ranked second behind Santa Barbara in the 4-A Division, 
with Brentwood ranked second to Pasadena Poly in the 1-A Division.

Grace Jones, the Jamaican singer-actress known for her striking crew-cut hair 
and disco-style singing, has been charged in Jamaica with possession of 
cocaine, authorities said Monday. Jones, 37, was scheduled to appear in a 
magistrates' court in Kingston to answer the charges. A police spokesman said 
an undisclosed amount of cocaine was found in Jones' purse, wrapped in Jamaican 
two-dollar notes, during a search early Sunday of the home she shares with her 
boyfriend, singer-songwriter Chris Stanley. Although known primarily as a 
singer, Jones has also acted in such films as "Conan the Barbarian," "Vamp," 
and Roger Moore's last James Bond movie, "A View to a Kill." Claudia Puig

Leaders of Britain's Jewish community on Monday criticized a musical comedy 
spoofing Adolf Hitler that opens this month in a London fringe theater to 
coincide with the 100th anniversary of the dictator's birth. "The Adolf Hitler 
Show," with actor Brian McDermott in the title role, gives a camp portrayal of 
the Nazi leader appearing in an assortment of swastikas, black stockings and 
suspenders. The show, scheduled to open at the Old Swan Cabaret Bar on April 
27, is said to be a loosely based follow-up to the Mel Brooks' film "The 
Producers," about a madcap impresario putting on a musical called "Springtime 
for Hitler." Claudia Puig

Comic actor Terry-Thomas, who is suffering from Parkinson's disease, received 
about $170,000 (100,000) raised at a London charity benefit Sunday. "I was 
shocked to the marrow," said writer Richard Hope Hawkins, who helped organize 
the event on behalf of the 77-year-old British actor. "Here was a man who had 
given so much enjoyment to millions of people and he was a complete wreck . . . 
now we can make sure Terry spends his last days as comfortably as possible."

ROSEN, PENNARIO TEAM AT COLEMAM CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cellist Nathaniel Rosen and pianist Leonard Pennario offered a fascinating 
study in contrasts at their Coleman Chamber Concerts appearance in Beckman 
Auditorium at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Playing three great cello sonatas (Beethoven's G-minor, Opus 5, Debussy's and 
Rachmaninoff's), the duo expressed highly individual concepts of each 
composition while maintaining generally tidy ensemble and total musical 
integrity Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen has developed into a genuine showman while sacrificing nothing of lofty 
artistic purpose. His visual theatrics flow directly from the music, neither 
overpowering nor trivializing it. He produces the aural goods, to order and 
without disorder, that justify the heart-on-sleeve emoting. This was 
grand-manner cello playing. 
</P>
<P>
Pennario, on the other hand, parked his familiar dazzle somewhere else for this 
occasion, serving instead as the most discreet of collaborators. This approach 
-- piano as foil to the cello's diamond -- worked well enough except for those 
passages where the pianist was plainly too deferential. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's G-minor Sonata (composed in 1796) emerged as an absorbing 
conundrum, the same piece played two different ways simultaneously: Pennario's 
pristine, rather faceless Classical-period delineation alongside Rosen's 
emphasis on elements presaging the Romantic era. The breakneck clip of the 
final Allegro found Pennario having trouble articulating runs, Rosen sailing 
through with nimble nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
Debussy's sonata was splendidly served both by the pianist's almost obstinate 
restraint and the cellist's flamboyant eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen met every demand of the blowzy Rachmaninoff with lustrous tone 
(unaffected by tempo extremes), abandoned bravura and heart-rending, songful 
legato, seconded by Pennario's secure virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Encores: Chopin's E-flat Largo, soulfully limned, and the Scherzo of the 
Prokofiev Sonata, a romp for both artists. BRUCE BURROUGHS

TRIO D'AMSTERDAM PLAYS AT BULLOCKS WILSHIRE

<P>
The Chamber Music in Historic Sites series came up with another winner. 
</P>
<P>
The site was the intimate, acoustically and visually treasurable Directoire 
Room of Bullocks Wilshire, with its George de Winter murals that manage to move 
most of Paris' monuments (including the Arc de Triomphe) to the banks of a 
country stream in which a Pocahontas-like maiden is taking a swim as assorted 
swains, children and a milkmaid (with cow) do their various things in the 
foreground. To see them -- the murals -- is to love them, instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday evening program, presented with optimum polish and forcefulness on 
period instruments by the Trio d'Amsterdam -- clarinetist Eric Hoeprich, 
pianist Stanley Hoogland, cellist Tanya Tomkins -- and violist Lucy van Dael 
was brief and potent: Mozart's sublime Trio in E-flat, K. 498; Weber's 
featherweight, range-rovingly virtuosic and hugely entertaining "Sylvana" 
Variations, and Beethoven's swaggering Trio in B-flat, Opus 11. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeprich drew an astonishing variety of tone from two different instruments, a 
five-keyed clarinet for Mozart and Beethoven, one with perhaps twice that many 
keys for Weber's convoluted tootling. 
</P>
<P>
Hoogland's fortepiano too proved remarkable for the strength, clarity and 
evenness of its tone -- or was it that for once we were hearing these antiques 
in the kind of room for which they were intended?HERBERT GLASS

GUITARIST WILLIAMS RETURNS TO AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making the routine sound fresh and inspiring may be one of the greatest gifts 
for a musician. With guitarist John Williams' first Los Angeles appearance in 
two years at the Ambassador Auditorium, Saturday and Sunday nights, this gift 
was displayed in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is still a remarkable musician whose playing remains a wonder. In his 
hands, rapid passages flow effortlessly, melodies sing and difficult techniques 
seemingly become child's play. 
</P>
<P>
While his versatility finds him exploring jazz, popular music and new music, he 
masters traditional repertory with similar confidence and authority. Standing 
ovations and three encores greeted his Sunday performance of a half 
Baroque/half 20th-Century program that the Australian-born, English guitarist 
presented with low-volume amplification. 
</P>
<P>
True, Williams has played the bulk of the music heard in these latest recitals 
many times before: his own carefully wrought transcriptions of Scarlatti 
Sonatas and the Chaconne from Bach's D-minor Partita, plus some flashy pieces 
by Barrios. But he still commands every note with charm, every phrase without 
seam and every piece with intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed with the familiar offerings were a few new undertakings, 
highlighted by Toru Takemitsu's "Folios" (1974). Here, Williams approached the 
mild dissonances, pulsating rhythms and koto-imitating stretches with delicacy 
and special attention to sonority. 
</P>
<P>
Two Post-Modern pieces by Leo Brouwer -- the overly sentimental, tonal 
"Berceuse" and the more virtuosic "Danza Caracteristica" -- provided occasional 
moments of interest. "Sunburst," by Glendale composer Andrew York, seeks a 
popular, new age appeal that proved a bit commercial -- in the "Windham Hill" 
sense of the word -- but provided some moments of admirable virtuosity as 
well.GREGG WAGER

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: EXAMINING COMPLEX AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Native American Film and Video Festival, presented by the UCLA Film and 
Television Archives in Melnitz Theater, Thursday through Sunday, offers a 
comprehensive view of the lives and culture of American Indians, their 
aspirations and the complex challenges facing them. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Bowman's unsparingly honest 40-minute "Navajo Talking Picture" (1986) 
launches the festival Thursday at 7:30 p.m. with a study of an American Indian 
documentarian encountering unexpected difficulties in trying to film her 
elegant Navajo grandmother as she goes about her daily life, weaving rugs in 
her remote, simple home to supplement her Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Bowman speaks no Navajo and her grandmother no English, so it's 
not until she finds someone to translate for her that she learns her 
grandmother resents being filmed because it goes against her beliefs. Bowman, 
rather than her grandmother, becomes the subject of her own film, and "Navajo 
Talking Picture" is really about Bowman's discovery of how little she knows or 
understands about her ancestral culture. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Spotted Eagle's 10-minute "Do Indians Shave?" (1972), screening Saturday, 
reveals good-humoredly how little the participants of a Manhattan Easter 
Parade, average Americans all, know about American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Sunrising Osawa's 27-minute video "In the Heart of Big Mountain" (1988) 
cuts to the heart of the tragic consequences of the attempt to relocate Navajos 
from their sacred lands so ripe for energy development projects. Osawa focuses 
on three generations of women. At the center of the film is a handsome older 
woman, one of the few tribal elders fluent in English, who speaks of her 
determination to resist relocation. In the course of the film, we learn that 
her own mother died only recently, shortly after she had witnessed the 
bulldozing of a tree she apparently had held sacred all her life. By the end of 
the film, the tribal elder's middle-aged daughter will also have died of a 
cerebral hemorrhage, but not before telling us that relocation (to a new 
$100,000 tract home with every modern convenience) has ruined her, that she 
longs to be near the site where she was born. 
</P>
<P>
Other films and videos deal with tribal religions, myths, stories and songs and 
stress the importance of preserving oral traditions. On a positive note, Larry 
Cesspooch's 20-minute video "Red Dawn" introduces us to Luke Duncan, a Ute 
telephone lineman who has managed to respect his native culture while finding 
pride in a mainstream job. 
</P>
<P>
Of special interest to silent film buffs is the Sunday 5 p.m. screening of "The 
Vanishing American" (1925), starring Richard Dix in a Zane Grey story. 
</P>
<P>
For full schedule: (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013. 
</P>
<P>
The Films of Werner Schroeter, another UCLA Film Archives series, offers an 
all-too-rare opportunity to see the work of the least commercial film maker of 
the New German Cinema. It begins tonight at 8 with "The Kingdom of Naples" 
(1978), unavailable since its Filmex '79 showing. A prodigious work of the 
imagination, as awesome as it is demanding, it expresses the unending misery 
and exploitation of Naples' wretched poor, as exemplified by a brother and 
sister whom we see mature in the postwar decades. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeter's intensely operatic style becomes a way of illuminating profound 
social, political and moral concerns and of embracing a large and vivid 
spectrum of humanity.

U.S. UNVEILS PLAN TO FIGHT D.C. DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
WILL BUILD PRISONS, DEPLOY AGENTS IN $80-MILLION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration on Monday unveiled an $80-million plan to build prisons 
in the nation's capital and deploy federal agents in its streets in an effort 
to crack down on an unprecedented wave of drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Administration took steps to banish drug traffickers from 
public housing projects across the country by installing fences around the 
complexes and speeding the eviction of known drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The two efforts -- announced by William J. Bennett, director of the White House 
Office of National Drug Control Policy; Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Housing 
and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp -- mark the first formal anti-drug 
initiatives aimed at fulfilling President Bush's vow that "this scourge will 
end." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jails Overcrowded 
</P>
<P>
The new funding for the District of Columbia will seek to ease strains on 
overcrowded jails and overburdened police in an effort to rid the streets of 
the drug offenders whose turf wars have transformed the city into the nation's 
murder capital. 
</P>
<P>
In outlining the plan, Bennett harshly denounced city officials for an 
"irresponsibility . . . that requires the federal government to step in to do 
things that they should be doing for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett also said the crackdown likely would be repeated in other 
jurisdictions later this year after his office issues its congressionally 
mandated recommendations about the course of the nation's anti-drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Washington for the first major assault should not be taken as 
a signal that "other cities are going to be ignored," Bennett said. "They're 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Mayor Marion Barry told reporters Monday that he welcomes federal 
assistance and the "idea of Washington being a model" in programs to fight 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, whose troubled Administration was said by Bennett to have "failed to 
serve its citizens," left a news conference before reporters could ask him if 
he had been offended by the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and other law enforcement personnel in the District of Columbia 
long have complained about a lack of prison space and a lack of progress toward 
construction of a new federal prison for which Congress already has 
appropriated $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Bennett charged Monday, is that "thousands of people regularly 
arrested for drugs and other serious crimes . . . regularly go free." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan seeks to remedy that problem by transferring 250 
already-sentenced prisoners from the District of Columbia jail to facilities 
elsewhere in the federal system, thus opening jail space to defendants arrested 
in the stepped-up drive against drug violators. 
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, the plan calls for two new jail and prison facilities in 
the Washington area to be completed within two years. They will include a 
500-bed pretrial detention facility on excess federal land and a 700-bed 
federal correctional institution to serve the Washington-Baltimore area. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agents to be deployed in the effort will help to coordinate a new 
task force that will concentrate on crack cocaine distributors and to form a 
unified intelligence operation that will work with all metropolitan-area drug 
enforcement units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
57 Investigators and Staff 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said the task force will include 57 additional federal, state and 
local investigators and support staff, including 11 Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents and five Pentagon intelligence analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI temporarily will reassign 25 agents to provide technical and forensic 
advice for investigations of major drug distribution networks and violent crime 
tied to drugs. The bureau is to set up a central database to catalogue rapidly 
increasing homicides in the city as part of a program designed to apprehend the 
most violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
There were 372 homicides reported in Washington last year, and the city's 58 
murders per 100,000 citizens was the highest rate in the nation. Already this 
year, 135 people have been killed, setting a pace exceeding last year's record 
clip. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard had been expected to play a role in the anti-drug crackdown, 
but the plan announced Monday indicated that the Guard's involvement is 
"currently under review." Administration officials said, however, that the 
Guard almost certainly will be enlisted to assist law enforcement officers with 
administrative duties and might also help to patrol city streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. to Take Some Cases 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to ensure that drug traffickers are subject to stringent 
penalties, the officials said, U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens will transfer 
"appropriate cases" from the local court to U.S. District Court, where federal 
laws calling for mandatory prison terms can be invoked. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, cases subject to the death penalty under sweeping anti-drug 
legislation approved by Congress last year also may be prosecuted by federal 
authorities rather than by the District of Columbia, where there is no capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its broad scope, the plan stopped short of declaring Washington a 
"high-intensity drug trafficking area," a designation that could have given the 
Administration power to marshal even more sweeping federal resources. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett previously had indicated that he planned to make such an announcement 
but said Monday that his office had not determined the basis on which such a 
designation should be made. He indicated that the Administration is wary of 
setting a precedent that could have encouraged other cities immediately to 
apply for similar assistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Choosing Capital 
</P>
<P>
"There is a special relationship between Washington and the federal government, 
and I think most Americans understand that," Bennett said, explaining the 
choice of the city for the first major drug assault. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government was acting on a "kind of emergency basis" in Washington 
"to see what we can learn" about future anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown in the nation's public housing projects, announced by Kemp, would 
seek to rid the complexes of the increasing influence of drug dealers and drug 
users. Kemp distributed the recommendations Monday in "action memos" to housing 
administrators around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The most far-reaching plan, already adopted in Virginia and now scheduled for 
the District of Columbia, would allow HUD to speed evictions of individuals 
convicted of drug-related criminal offenses by denying them the right to appeal 
those evictions to an administrative board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protection for Tenants 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said such steps would be approved only in states where existing laws 
afford proper protection to tenants. But he made clear that the purpose is "to 
remove HUD as a barrier from getting those folks evicted." 
</P>
<P>
A second measure focuses on efforts to increase security at public housing 
compounds by barring known drug dealers, requiring tenants to use photo 
identification cards, increasing police patrols and building fences around some 
complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp also urged housing administrators to take steps to evict unlawful tenants 
and to ensure that individuals evicted from one complex for drug offenses are 
not permitted to take up residence in other public housing. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Gary Squier, who took over Monday as acting director of the 
troubled Los Angeles City Housing Authority, said the authority had not taken a 
position on waiving the administrative appeals procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Squier said the authority would need federal funding to beef up its existing 
police force in the city's 21 public housing complexes but rejected the 
proposed identification card scheme as unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago and New York housing projects are vertical -- tall buildings," he 
said. "Ours are spread over 50 acres. If you just look at the topography, to 
have guards at each of the access points would require a lot of staffing." 
</P>

1,000 IN ABORTION RIGHTS CAMPAIGN LOBBY CONGRESS 
</P>

<P>
In the largest lobbying effort ever undertaken on the abortion issue, more than 
1,000 activists jammed the halls of Congress Monday, urging lawmakers to uphold 
women's abortion rights, family planning services and equal protection under 
the laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sending Congress a big signal today because we're never turning back, 
we'll never allow abortion protections to be taken away," said Eleanor Smeal, 
former president of the National Organization for Women, which coordinated the 
turnout on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying, a continuation of a Sunday march that drew participants from 
across the nation, targeted congressional friends and foes with carefully 
crafted pitches to preserve the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that 
made abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates also urged lawmakers to increase funds for birth control programs, to 
pass the equal rights amendment and to support the availability of RU-486, a 
controversial pill that can induce an abortion. The drug is not sold in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest campaign we've pulled together so far," Smeal said. She 
predicted that supporters would continue to visit Washington on behalf of 
abortion rights and that more demonstrations like Sunday's would be organized. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that the weekend event drew more than 600,000 participants, 
although U.S. Park police earlier had estimated the number at 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's politicking started early, with groups of demonstrators setting out to 
meet with their representatives in Congress. Before they began knocking on 
doors, however, many were given briefings by organizers on key issues to raise 
and strategies to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
When dealing with anti-abortion members, for example, lobbyists were advised to 
steer clear of "polarizing" questions that could jeopardize meaningful 
discussion, said Nancy Hirshbein, a lobbyist representing the Coalition for 
Reproductive Choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Just tell them what concerns you and don't be shy," she said in one briefing 
session. "Remember that they represent you and that they work for us. It's 
their job to listen." 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old Los Angeles woman, who asked not to be identified, said that she 
would "dearly love" to camp outside the office of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a 
staunch abortion opponent, to make a personal appeal. Hirshbein cautioned her, 
however, that lobbyists would have the biggest impact by dealing with their own 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
For most, it proved to be an eye-opening experience. Some were dismayed to 
learn that their congressmen were not in their offices and that they would have 
to deal with staff members. Others seemed bewildered by the profusion of issues 
raised in the briefing sessions, many of which they had never encountered 
before. 
</P>
<P>
As they made their rounds to House and Senate offices, most of the advocates 
delivered information packages containing a 30-minute "Abortion for Survival" 
video, as well as check-off lists seeking lawmakers' opinions on a variety of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never done anything like this before, but I came because of the issue 
itself," said Sheila Hittelman-Sohn, a 51-year-old San Diego woman who marched 
Sunday with her 27-year-old daughter, Deborah. "It really galvanized me to 
speak out." 
</P>
<P>
After watching the abortion video in a training session, Hittelman-Sohn set out 
for the office of her local congressman, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego). Arriving 
unannounced, she was given a brief interview with Bates, who said that he 
supports her positions.

WRIGHT VIOLATED RULES, PANEL TENTATIVELY FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE CITES SPEAKER'S FAILURE TO REPORT BENEFITS FROM TEXAS 
PARTNER AS GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee has concluded tentatively that Speaker Jim Wright 
(D-Tex.) broke House rules by failing to report as gifts a number of benefits 
received from a Texas business partner, a source close to the investigation 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel provisionally agreed with its special counsel, Chicago attorney 
Richard J. Phelan, that the partnership was used to funnel gifts to Wright in 
the form of an almost rent-free apartment, a Cadillac and an annual $18,000 
salary for his wife, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
House rules require members to report gifts of $100 or more on annual financial 
disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is still considering whether Wright circumvented a limit on 
outside income for House members by promoting bulk sales of his book of memoirs 
to political supporters, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came as the 12-member ethics panel prepared to begin today what 
its members hope will be their final week of deliberations on a preliminary 
inquiry into the Speaker's financial affairs and conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Its report, expected at the end of this week or next week, is widely expected 
to present a "statement of possible violations," a finding similar to an 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Wright then would get an opportunity to present his defense. After that the 
committee would issue a ruling or recommend that the full House take action 
against him. A decision by the House to reprimand or censure Wright could force 
him to resign as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has acknowledged that he may have used bad judgment or committed 
technical violations of House rules without meaning to do so. He has contended 
that his wife, Betty, earned her pay by doing research for a real estate firm 
and that the use of the car and apartment were furnished as fringe benefits. 
The Wrights later bought the car and the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a defender of the Speaker confirmed that the Ethics Committee was 
focusing on Wright's complex financial ties with the Texas businessman, Ft. 
Worth developer George A. Mallick Jr., and the controversial book publishing 
arrangement that brought Wright $55,000 in royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.) said that Wright's attorney, William C. Oldaker, had 
prepared a document listing the alleged violations of House rules cited by 
Phelan, along with a defense of the Speaker's position on each violation. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 members of the House already have been briefed on the issues being 
considered by the panel, Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, CBS News reported late Monday that the committee 
already has voted to accuse Wright of more than 30 ethics violations. A 
spokesman for Wright, Mark Johnson, labeled the broadcast as "absurd" and said 
the Speaker had no information of that nature. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.), a member of the ethics panel, declined to comment 
on whether the committee has started voting on the charges against Wright. 
"There's a lot of speculation," Myers said. "There's some truth to some of it 
and some of it is just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a good chance that the committee will issue its findings 
this week but that the action could be delayed until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a long way from announcing our results," said another member of the 
committee, who asked not to be identified. He said final votes had not been 
taken on the allegations against Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Wright initially brushed aside the charges against him as the work of 
Republican extremists, but the Speaker and his friends now are taking them much 
more seriously. Senior House Democrats, in fact, have said privately that they 
are seriously troubled by press reports of the case against their leader. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's business ties with Mallick grew from a friendship that started more 
than a quarter-century ago in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Partnership 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's wife was paid $18,000 a year by a Mallick-owned company in 1978 
and 1979. From 1980 to 1984, she received the same salary from Mallightco, an 
investment partnership created by the Wrights and Mallick and his wife, 
Marlene. Each couple made contributions valued at $58,000 to finance a half 
share of the venture. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the salary received by Betty Wright, the Wrights were allowed to 
use a Ft. Worth condominium owned by the Mallick family, at first without 
paying rent and later for a $22 daily rate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's special counsel contends that Mallightco was created 
essentially as a conduit to allow Mallick to funnel income and benefits to the 
Speaker and his wife, sources close to the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Betty Wright has remained silent on the matter, Wright has said that 
she earned her salary by doing research on possible investments for the 
company. Phelan reportedly has argued that she did little to justify her pay. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Speaker reported the salary received by his wife as income on his 
annual financial disclosure reports, he did not characterize it as a gift. He 
did not list the use of the apartment or the 1979 Cadillac provided to his wife 
during the six-year period.

80% ENERGY GAIN IN FUSION TEST REPORTED; 
</P>
<P>
TEXAS RESEARCH ONLY DEEPENS MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Scientists at Texas A&amp;M University said Monday they are getting up to 80% 
more energy out of a nuclear fusion experiment than they are putting in, 
exciting fusion researchers but deepening a scientific mystery that has 
bedeviled experts around the world for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas researchers stopped short of claiming they have achieved energy 
through fusion and they said they do not understand why they are producing more 
energy than they they are consuming. But scientists from the Georgia Institute 
of Technology announced just hours later that they were getting strong evidence 
of fusion from similar experiments. 
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back announcements were the best news yet for two scientists who 
claimed last month to have achieved fusion at room temperature with a simple 
table-top apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Great 'Relief' 
</P>
<P>
B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah expressed great "relief" when the 
Texas scientists told him of their results, the Texas team said during a press 
conference here. Pons and Milton Fleischmann of the University of Southhampton, 
England, have had little encouragement from the scientific community since 
announcing that their simple device could help end the world's energy woes 
because it promises a virtually inexhaustible source of fuel, which would come 
from ordinary seawater. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts greeted the Salt Lake City announcement on March 23 with profound 
skepticism, an attitude that persists today. But dozens of laboratories around 
the world set out immediately to try to duplicate the experiment. No one, 
however, has so far has been able to both produce excess energy and detect the 
signature of a fusion reaction, although there have been scattered claims of 
success with the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Charles R. Martin, an electrochemist with Texas A&amp;M, told reporters Monday 
that "we have confirmed" that more energy is produced by a simple 
"electrochemical cell than is put into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in agreement with the findings of Pons and Fleischmann," he added. "We 
have run the experiment using four different amounts of electric current and 
have found that excess energy varies between 60% and 80%." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the experiment began running at 1 a.m. Saturday and it has been 
producing energy ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believes the energy is produced by fusion, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"I would have more confidence if we could detect other symptoms of fusion." 
Additional efforts to determine whether fusion is causing the energy are 
continuing at the university, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Unclear' 
</P>
<P>
"If it is nuclear, it is still unclear to us," added his colleague, Kenneth 
Marsh, a thermodynamicist whose expertise is in studying and measuring the flow 
of heat, which is the form of energy detected by Pons and Fleischmann. The 
other member of the Texas team is Bruce Gammon, also a thermodynamicist. 
</P>
<P>
While the Texas researchers have not pinpointed the cause of the excess heat, 
researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology claimed Monday to have 
detected neutrons and tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, from a similar 
experiment on the Atlanta campus. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the signatures of fusion is production of neutrons, so we felt that if 
we could detect neutrons coming from this apparatus, that would confirm 
fusion," said James Mahaffey, who led the five-member Georgia Tech team. "Our 
data convinced me that we are making neutrons in that vessel. There is no way 
to get neutrons unless something nuclear is going on." 
</P>
<P>
The Georgia team, however, did not attempt to measure heat. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly puzzling in the Texas A&amp;M work is the fact that researchers 
there found a net increase in energy almost immediately, despite the fact that 
Pons has said it takes many days for the apparatus to begin producing heat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned" when their experiment began producing excess heat almost 
immediately, Marsh said. Martin said later the electrode they are using is very 
small, and he said it probably takes less time for a smaller unit to begin 
producing energy than a larger one. 
</P>
<P>
After they first measured the excess heat, the three men spent the next 30 
hours in the laboratory trying to analyze the surprising result. 
</P>
<P>
By late Sunday afternoon, even though they still were at a loss for an 
explanation, they decided to call a press conference and reveal their finding. 
Looking fatigued but happy, the three scientists said they are confident their 
results will hold up under scrutiny because they used a sophisticated system 
that is less prone to error than that used by the Utah scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, "which eliminates many common errors," directly and continuously 
measures any temperature changes, revealing precisely how much energy is going 
into the apparatus and how much is being produced, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The energy output, he said, "is rock steady." 
</P>
<P>
The apparatus used by the Texas team is almost identical to the one used in 
Utah. It consists of an electrode with a palladium cylinder one millimeter in 
diameter and five centimeters long, surrounded by a fine platinum gauze. The 
electrode is immersed in "heavy water," which contains a heavy hydrogen ion 
called deuterium. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann say that when a small electrical charge is applied to the 
electrode, deuterium crowds into the palladium cylinder so tightly that it is 
possible for the nuclei to overcome their repulsive electrical charge and fuse, 
releasing heat. 
</P>
<P>
If that is indeed what is going on, then neutrons and other products should be 
released in detectable quantities. There have been scattered reports of some 
success, most notably from a team at Brigham Young University, but in all those 
cases there are also marked differences with the Pons-Fleischmann experiment. 
The Brigham Young and Georgia Tech scientists, for example, did not detect any 
excess heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replication Remains Elusive 
</P>
<P>
"The feedback we are getting is that nobody has succeeded" in fully replicating 
the Utah experiment, said plasma physicist Keith Thomassen of the Lawrence 
Livermore Laboratory. None of the major national laboratories, he added, has 
reported finding neutrons. 
</P>
<P>
That may be partly because details of the experiment are still not well 
understood, Thomassen said. 
</P>
<P>
Pons said additional details will be published soon in a major science journal. 
</P>
<P>
"Most labs are like us," Thomassen said. "They are still feeling not totally 
informed. We're getting bits and pieces of info, but not the kind I would have 
expected after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions are not all answered." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pons and Fleischmann worked on their research for more than five 
years, so presumably they must have made many refinements over the years, and 
some subtle variations could make a lot of difference. 
</P>
<P>
For example, scientists at Livermore who were working on the experiment thought 
they had something recently when their neutron counter began registering a 
significant increase in neutrons, which should be produced by fusion. But it 
was quite warm in the area because of nearby electronic equipment, so "somebody 
brought in a fan," Thomassen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neutron Count Drops 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the fan was turned on, the neutron count dropped back to normal. 
The warmth in the room had caused the neutron detectors to drift out of 
calibration, indicating that far more neutrons were being emitted than was the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to be fooled," Thomassen said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that although the heat detected by the Texas team is "intriguing . . . 
it leaves us grasping for straws." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas experts were also grasping a little Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very unusual result and we have not totally dismissed the 
possibility of some unusual chemical process which we have not accounted for," 
Martin said in the press conference. "We are currently exploring this 
possibility further." 
</P>
<P>
Pons has insisted that the heat generated by his experiment could only come 
from fusion because there is no chemical process that could have generated that 
much excess energy. At one point, he said earlier, the heat was great enough to 
vaporize the electrode, so it had to be hotter than 2829 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, however, was not willing to make that leap. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel qualified to discuss fusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the entire episode has been the inability 
of major laboratories to duplicate the experiment in every way. Livermore's 
Thomassen noted that it should be easier to repeat the experiment than prove it 
is not true, since it is difficult to prove a negative. 
</P>
<P>
Unless someone succeeds soon, he said, the process could take months. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer it takes, the more suspicious people are going to get," he added. 
</P>

SILBERMAN ALLEGEDLY BOASTED TO AGENT OF DRUG MONEY LAUNDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prominent businessman Richard T. Silberman believed that $300,000 he allegedly 
laundered for an undercover FBI agent came from Colombian cocaine traffickers 
and boasted to the agent that he had been involved in money-laundering ventures 
numerous times before, according to an affidavit unsealed by federal 
prosecutors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During a wiretapped telephone conversation, Silberman told the agent that "this 
is not my first go-around" and said he solicited money-laundering business 
through Chris Petti, an alleged co-conspirator and organized crime figure, 
because he "wanted a little diversification," the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also said he was anxious to move on to "bigger and better things" 
after allegedly completing two laundering transactions negotiated with the 
agent during meetings at several San Diego hotels, the document says. 
</P>
<P>
A wealthy San Diego businessman and powerful player in local and state 
Democratic politics for 15 years, Silberman was arrested by FBI agents Friday 
afternoon at the Hyatt Islandia Hotel while allegedly arranging to launder $1.1 
million in funds that were portrayed by an undercover agent as proceeds from 
cocaine sales. The arrest -- along with several other transactions conducted 
during the six months that Silberman was under FBI scrutiny -- was secretly 
videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint issued by prosecutors Monday, Silberman, 59, is accused of 
conspiring with Petti and two other men still at large to launder $300,000 in 
cash represented to be the proceeds of cocaine trafficking. He is also charged 
with violating a federal law requiring that all financial transactions be 
reported to the U.S. Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who is married to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, faces 
up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted of the charges. After spending 
one night in the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, he was released on a 
$500,000 personal surety bond Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Silberman and Petti, 62, were formally charged before U.S. 
Magistrate Roger McKee and a swarm of news reporters and onlookers. Dressed in 
a dark blue suit and looking haggard, Silberman was accompanied to court by 
Golding and noted criminal defense attorney Milton J. Silverman, who was making 
a special appearance and who has not been retained. 
</P>
<P>
Although prosecutors asked that McKee require Silberman to secure the bond with 
property, the magistrate declined, saying he believed that Silberman would 
honor his promise to return to court. McKee, who confiscated Silberman's 
passport and required him to sign a list of standard conditions required of 
those posting bail, scheduled a preliminary hearing for April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supported by Wife 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Silberman declined to comment, on the advice of his 
attorney. But Golding, wrapping her arm tightly around her husband, vowed that 
Silberman's name would be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
"He's innocent, that's all there is to it," said Golding, her voice tremulous. 
As for the effect her husband's legal woes may have on her rising career in 
Republican politics, Golding said, "I haven't thought much about that. I'm a 
county supervisor and will continue to be one." 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the couple's brief meeting with reporters, Golding 
whispered "I love you" to her husband. Silberman then leaned down and kissed 
his wife on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles Gorder said the government has "a very strong 
case" against Silberman and is optimistic that its charges will hold up in 
court. In particular, he said, Silberman was told frequently that the source of 
the agent's money was cocaine trafficking and that such knowledge did not dim 
his desire to do business. 
</P>
<P>
"On several occasions, to make it clear that the money was coming from cocaine 
sales, the agent would say it was furnished by Colombian traffickers," Gorder 
said. "Silberman would say something like, 'Well, I don't want to hear that,' 
or 'I didn't hear that.' (But) clearly he did." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Silberman and Petti, prosecutors have charged Darryl Nakatsuka 
-- also known as Darryl Naka -- and Jack Norman Myers in the case. Petti, who 
was also arraigned Monday before McKee, is being held without bail. He was 
serving probation for a federal gaming conviction at the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, the former son-in-law of MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman, helped Silberman 
raise money for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. as early as 1978, sources said. 
Top Brown campaign officials, including Gray Davis, who is now state 
controller, often stayed overnight at the Myers' Beverly Hills residence while 
visiting Los Angeles on campaign trips, said two sources close to the Brown 
Administration who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman -- who held several top posts in the Brown Administration, including 
business and transportation secretary, finance director and the chief of staff 
-- was a close personal and political confidant of the former governor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Deal 
</P>
<P>
The 76-page affidavit released Monday provides the first glimpse of how solid a 
case the government may have against Silberman. Prepared by FBI Special Agent 
Charles B. Walker, it details the genesis of the laundering deals and the 
system Silberman allegedly used to dispose of the $300,000. The document 
suggests that evidence against Silberman ranges from extensive transcripts of 
wiretaps of more than a dozen telephones -- including pay telephones frequently 
used by Petti and Silberman's office phone at Yuba Natural Resources Inc. -- to 
videotapes of cash transfers and the negotiating session on the day of 
Silberman's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, Silberman proposed a laundering scheme to Petti, 
the initial target of the investigation, last fall, telling the alleged 
associate of the Chicago Mafia that he could "get money out of the country, 
launder it, and realize a profit at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Petti then allegedly set up a meeting with Robert Benjamin, a convicted felon 
and longtime acquaintance of Petti who became a cooperating witness for the FBI 
in 1986. Benjamin said he had a New Jersey associate who needed to move money 
on the West Coast for Colombian cocaine traffickers, and offered to put him in 
touch with Silberman. The New Jersey associate was, in fact, the undercover FBI 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Test' Run 
</P>
<P>
A series of meetings among the agent, Petti and Silberman followed at coffee 
shops around San Diego, the affidavit says. Although Silberman said he was not 
interested in laundering less than $500,000, the agent insisted on a "test" run 
of $100,000, and Silberman agreed, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
As details of the deal were hammered out, Silberman was told that the agent 
represented Colombians whose money was "not legitimate." During one wiretapped 
call to Silberman, the agent said of his associates, "All they know is coke and 
they don't know nothing else." And in a meeting with Silberman in February, the 
agent called his sources "a bunch of . . . Colombian cocaine drug lords." 
Silberman responded, "I don't want to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says the first "test" deal, involving $100,000 in federal money, 
was made Nov. 30 when Nakatsuka picked up the money from the undercover agent 
at the Airport Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Swap 
</P>
<P>
Those funds were apparently to be used in a stock swap involving Yuba American 
Gold Inc., a subsidiary of Yuba Natural Resources formed in April, 1987, but 
prosecutors say details of Silberman's plans are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of several wiretapped conversations quote Silberman as touting his 
accomplishments and saying he was anxious to arrange larger deals with the 
agent. During a wiretapped conversation on Dec. 2, Silberman asked if the agent 
and he could conduct another transaction before the end of the year. He told 
the agent that there would be "a lot more potential if we got active" and said 
he hoped that the agent realized "you're dealing with something . . . I've done 
. . . 15, 20 years a lot of different ways." 
</P>
<P>
The second $200,000 transaction, also involving federal money, occurred Feb. 
22, and that money was used to purchase zero coupon bonds, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
But the bonds turned over to the undercover agent came up $50,000 short, 
prompting the undercover agent to hesitate in negotiating additional deals with 
Silberman, the affidavit said. Angry about the snafu, Silberman told the agent 
that the Westlake stockbrokerage firm that he used for the transfer was 
normally reliable but apparently was "playing games." 
</P>
<P>
If the firm failed to rectify the situation, Silberman promised to bring in 
some of Petti's "friends" and have them use "muscle" to express his displeasure 
"in no uncertain terms," according to the affidavit.

8TH-GRADERS SHOW SOME IMPROVEMENT AS WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although they are gradually improving, most California eighth-grade students 
are fair-to-barely adequate writers. They are slightly stronger in the complex 
thinking skills needed to write a coherent essay than they are in the basic 
mechanics of spelling and grammar. Eighth-grade girls are substantially better 
writers overall than eighth-grade boys. 
</P>
<P>
This was the profile of eighth-grade writing ability for the 1987-88 academic 
year that emerged from test results released Monday by the state Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The California writing exam, which the state has administered for the past two 
years, asks students to write one of six specific types of essays, such as an 
autobiographical sketch or an informative report. Educators consider it 
superior to the multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank type of standardized test 
that the state still uses to measure third- and sixth-graders' writing ability. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers are incorporating writing into the curriculum across the board," 
state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Monday. "Although we still 
have a long way to go, these results show that our efforts are paying off." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, 271,168 eighth-graders took the writing exam. Each student was 
given 45 minutes to write an essay on an assigned topic. Each exam was given a 
score from 1 to 6, which state officials translated into a schoolwide scaled 
score running from about 100 to 400. Because the test is designed to give a 
school an overall view of how well its students are writing, the state does not 
provide individual student scores. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the average score rose 6 points in the 1987-88 school year, from 250 
to 256. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the average score was 208, 
one point lower than the previous year's 209. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of the state's eighth-graders wrote adequate or marginally 
adequate essays, earning scores in the 3-to-4 range, state figures showed. 
Twelve percent wrote impressively, scoring in the 5-to-6 range, and 22% wrote 
poorly, in the 1-to-2 range. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a pattern from the previous year, girls scored an average of 280 
points, compared to 232 for boys. State education officials say that girls 
typically demonstrate stronger verbal ability than boys on standardized tests 
until about the 10th grade, when the disparity disappears. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six types of writing measured, students wrote informative reports most 
competently, said Beth Breneman, a language arts consultant in the state 
testing program. They had the greatest difficulty with persuasive writing -- 
specifically, in essays requiring evaluation and problem-solving. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified's eighth-graders wrote better problem-solving and 
informational essays than they did autobiographical and evaluative essays. Many 
educators nationally consider the California exam to be state-of-the-art. 
According to the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based education 
clearinghouse, the majority of the 22 states that test students' writing used 
the California exam as their model. 
</P>
<P>
Because thousands of essays must be read, scoring is a laborious process, state 
officials said. Last year, 384 teachers in six locations around the state spent 
six days grading the essays. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Maggard, an eighth-grade teacher at Alvarado Intermediate School in 
Rowland Heights, said she has seen an improvement in her students' writing 
ability in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Filling in the blanks does not let someone know whether a student can put 
everything together and write," she said. "Now we're writing more and our 
expectations are higher in terms of the finished product. We're seeing more 
polished writing." 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Gallagher, an eighth-grade teacher at Bell Gardens Intermediate School 
in the Montebello Unified School District, said that the test is valuable 
because it measures "the kind of writing we are asked to produce in everyday 
living."

Discipline exceeding acceptable levels was applied by San Diego Wild Animal 
Park keepers to Dunda the elephant in February, 1988, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has concluded in a letter of warning to the Zoological Society of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The April 6 letter said that results of an investigation by the department's 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service show "repeated disciplinary 
measures" on Feb. 17 and 18, 1988, to the 18-year-old female African elephant 
"did cause bruising and damage to the skin on the elephant's head and signs of 
behavioral stress." 
</P>
<P>
James W. Glosser, inspection service administrator, said that while zoos have 
to employ discipline to assure both the safety of animals and the public, "we 
must warn you that any further documented use of such excessive disciplinary 
measures (as occurred with Dunda) may result in legal action to secure 
compliance" with federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
Zoological Society spokesman Jeff Jouett said Monday that its officials 
disagree with the letter's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand by our own investigation and the investigations by the San Diego 
Humane Society, the San Diego city attorney and the American Assn. of 
Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which found that Dunda's short disciplinary 
training sessions were not excessive and did not cause unnecessary discomfort," 
Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials maintain that the discipline, which included chaining Dunda's 
legs, pulling her to the ground and beating her on the head with ax handles for 
short periods, was necessary to train Dunda not to lash out and try to injure 
her keepers. The incident occurred shortly after Dunda was transferred to the 
Wild Animal Park from the San Diego Zoo, where she had spent most of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Dunda's former keepers at the zoo criticized the sessions as 
unnecessary and brutal, but the numerous subsequent investigations produced 
conflicting conclusions. While the San Diego Humane Society and city attorney's 
office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone on 
animal cruelty charges, the Humane Society of the United States called the 
incident a clear case of abuse.

FOUR GUILTY IN $7.1-MILLION WELLS FARGO ROBBERY

Four people were convicted Monday on charges stemming from the second-largest 
cash heist in U.S. history, a $7.1-million Wells Fargo robbery allegedly used 
to finance a group seeking to overthrow the government in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
One defendant was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Key defendant Juan Segarra Palmer III was convicted on charges of robbery, 
conspiracy and transportation of stolen money; he was found innocent on four 
weapons-related charges. All charges stemmed from the Sept. 12, 1983, theft of 
cash from the Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Segarra, 39, a Harvard graduate, was charged in all 16 counts of the indictment 
and faced up to 150 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His bond was 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted in addition to Segarra were Antonio Comacho Negron, 45, a car 
mechanic; Norman Ramirez Talavera, 32, a graphic artist, and Robert Maldonado 
Rivera, 53, a lawyer. The only defendant cleared was Carlos Ayes Suarez, 29, an 
anthropology student. 
</P>
<P>
Comacho raised a clenched fist and denounced the proceedings in Spanish when he 
was led from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Backiel, Comacho's attorney, said he yelled: "The imperial power is 
showing how small it is." She said Comacho would appeal his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of errors and it was a slim case," she said. "Because he was a 
Puerto Rican patriot, he never expected justice and he won't ask for mercy." 
</P>
<P>
Segarra acknowledged that he knew about the robbery beforehand and received the 
stolen money to finance the activities of Los Macheteros, Spanish for 
"machete-wielders," a group seeking the overthrow of the U.S. government in 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
But Segarra steadfastly denied that he helped plan or execute the robbery, as 
the government charged. 
</P>
<P>
The other four defendants were charged with conspiracy and with either helping 
transport the stolen money or using part of it to finance toy giveaways in 
Hartford and Puerto Rico on Jan. 6, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The government contended that Los Macheteros recruited Wells Fargo guard Victor 
Gerena to carry out the robbery, then helped Gerena escape to Cuba, where he is 
believed to live now. 
</P>
<P>
The government presented 110 witnesses and more than 700 pieces of evidence, 
including tape-recorded conversations and documents seized from Los Macheteros 
members. 
</P>
<P>
About $80,000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized by FBI agents 
during searches in Puerto Rico and Boston on Aug. 30, 1985, when 13 people were 
arrested.

REFORMERS GAIN IN SOVIET VOTING; SAKHAROV NOMINATED

Ardent reformers, including some longtime political dissidents, have won seats 
in the Soviet Union's new national assembly, officials said Monday, announcing 
the results of runoff elections. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, nuclear physicist and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was 
among 28 members of the Academy of Sciences nominated Monday to run for 12 
unfilled seats allocated to the academy in the new assembly, the Congress of 
People's Deputies. The 28 nominees were chosen from among 168 contenders by 37 
members of the academy's presidium. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most prominent dissidents to win a seat in Sunday's election was Roy 
A. Medvedev, a Marxist historian expelled from the Communist Party for his 
attacks on Stalinism. Voters in a Moscow constituency gave him victory in the 
runoff, rehabilitating him more fully after 20 years in the political 
wilderness than any party action could. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historian Charged Smear 
</P>
<P>
Other prominent reformers elected from Moscow included historian Sergei 
Stankevich, who had alleged that the official Soviet press was trying to smear 
him by calling him a Zionist and a spy; Yuri Chernichenko, a prominent 
journalist and television commentator, and Yuri Ryzhov, the highly regarded 
director of the Moscow Aviation Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Baltic republic of Lithuania, candidates from the Movement for 
Perestroika, which is known as Sajudis there, won five of the eight seats at 
stake, but themovement's secretary general, Virgiljus Cepaitis, lost his own 
race in Vilnius, the capital. Sajudis now has 35 of Lithuania's 42 seats in the 
new parliament. 
</P>
<P>
For Sakharov, who spent nearly seven years in internal exile under the late 
President Leonid I. Brezhnev, his nomination was a vindication of both his 
longtime advocacy of human rights despite the government's displeasure and of 
his insistence on fresh elections within the Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidacies Vetoed 
</P>
<P>
Although Sakharov and most of the other pro-reform academics enjoyed widespread 
support, the academy's leadership had vetoed their candidacies in January, 
provoking street demonstrations and other protests and finally leading to an 
unprecedented revolt within the academy that forced a new election there as 
scientists refused to vote for many of the officially approved candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Since only eight of the academy's alloted 20 seats were filled during the 
initial voting, a new round of nominations and elections was ordered. The 
second full round of voting on the new nominees is scheduled for next month at 
the academy. 
</P>
<P>
The academy members nominated Monday included Roald Sagdeyev, the leading 
Soviet space specialist; Georgy A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. and Canada 
Institute, and Nikolai Shmelyov, a radical economist whose ideas have had a 
major impact on party and government policies. 
</P>
<P>
Additional elections are planned for the middle of May to choose deputies for 
the 199 constituencies where there was only a single candidate and he or she 
failed to win a majority of the votes cast. A majority of voters had scratched 
out their names on the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Elections for the entire Congress of People's Deputies are likely to be 
completed in a month, and its 2,250 members will then meet to elect the Supreme 
Soviet, a full-time parliament under an executive presidency. 
</P>
<P>
A third of the deputies are to come from constituencies based on one person, 
one vote; a third are coming from constituencies based on ethnic 
representation, and the final third are coming from "public organizations," 
ranging from the Communist Party and Communist Youth League to the Academy of 
Sciences, a temperance society and a national stamp collectors group.

U.S. KILLING OF TERRORISTS CAN BE JUSTIFIED, TOP ARMY LAWYER SAYS 
</P>

The Army's top lawyer has concluded that military strikes against terrorists 
can be justified legally without running afoul of a 1976 presidential order 
banning assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the Army's judge advocate general, argues in an 
eight-page draft memorandum that America's diplomatic and military 
bureaucracies have failed for too long to define the term assassination and 
that thanks to changes in "the nature of the threat," action against terrorists 
can be justified under the legal concept of national self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The employment of military force against a terrorist or terrorist organization 
to protect U.S. citizens or the national security of the United States is a 
legitimate exercise of the international legal right of self-defense and does 
not constitute assassination," Overholt concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the Overholt memorandum was first reported Monday by a trade 
publication, Defense Week, and quickly acknowledged by Army officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Dick Bridges, an Army spokesman, explained that the service had been 
encouraging legal debate within the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and other 
agencies in hopes of producing a common definition of assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges said the Army's basic "Law of Land Warfare" manual, last revised in 
1956, has a definition of assassination that dates back to The Hague Convention 
of 1907. 
</P>
<P>
That definition states, "It is especially forbidden to kill or wound 
treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army." 
</P>
<P>
The Overholt memo notes that war, in essence, legalizes the "killing of the 
enemy," but in peacetime, the standards of conduct must be defined under the 
U.N. Charter -- "which recognizes the inherent right of self-defense of 
nations" -- and domestic laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, then-President Gerald R. Ford signed a presidential order banning 
attempts to assassinate foreign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening 13 years, "the nature of the threat has changed, rather than 
the international legal right to respond to the threat," Overholt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"It is noted that the terrorist individuals or organizations envisaged as 
appropriate to necessitate or warrant an armed response by U.S. military forces 
are well-financed, highly organized paramilitary structures engaged full-time 
in the illegal use of force," the memo concludes. 
</P>
<P>
"A national decision to employ military force in self-defense against a 
legitimate terrorist threat would not be unlike that employed in response to an 
overt conventional threat."

GINGRICH INDICATES HOUSE TO PROBE REP. MCDADE 
</P>

Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), condemning corruption by either political party, 
suggested Monday that the House Ethics Committee will look into "very troubling 
allegations" concerning a veteran GOP congressman's fees from a defense 
contractor whose executives have pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"You can expect something to happen," Gingrich told reporters, in the case of 
Rep. Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.), who is in his 14th term in the House. Gingrich, 
who was elected last month to be the second-ranking House Republican leader, 
was the moving force behind charges of ethical violations against House Speaker 
Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is investigating whether McDade violated election or bribery laws by 
accepting more than $45,000 in campaign contributions and speaking fees from 
officials affiliated with United Chem-Con Corp. The FBI is also investigating 
McDade's use of United Chem-Con aircraft and two Delaware beach homes rented by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Six executives of the company pleaded guilty last November in federal court to 
charges of conspiracy to defraud the Defense Department of more than $12 
million. The executives were accused of inflating operating costs and using the 
excess money from Navy contracts to finance a lavish life style, including 
private jets and limousines. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal, which first disclosed the federal investigation of 
McDade, reported that he had used his influence as ranking Republican on both 
the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense and the Small Business 
Committee to channel Navy contracts to United Chem-Con. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, interviewed at a luncheon session with a group of reporters, said 
that he is "not comfortable" talking about the McDade case now that he ranks 
second in the Republican leadership. But he said that he intends to take up the 
case with McDade himself and with House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
McDade's office reported Monday that he was out of town and unavailable for 
comment. A senior McDade aide, when told of Gingrich's comments, declared: 
"Good heavens. Obviously we don't feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
The aide, who asked not to be identified, said: "We thought the (FBI) 
investigation was just a fishing expedition. I'm surprised Gingrich made those 
comments." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who promised to raise ethics as a principal issue in future House 
election campaigns, said that Congress needs "a more aggressive Ethics 
Committee" and a standard procedure for filing charges of ethical violations 
against its members. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee is expected to release its long-awaited report on the 
Wright investigation late this week or next week. A finding of a serious 
violation of House rules, if confirmed by the full House, could cost Wright his 
post as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said that such a finding would make members of Congress "absolutely 
obligated" to remove Wright from his post. He said that he would be "surprised" 
if Rep. Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House majority leader, has not 
succeeded Wright as Speaker by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Gingrich said that President Bush "can't afford" to seek 
consensus the way President Dwight D. Eisenhower did. The conservative 
movement, he said "is too strong for that, there would be an insurgency." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Gingrich has expressed admiration for Oliver L. North, the former 
White House aide now being tried for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. But 
for the first time, he expressed reservations Monday about some of North's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't set a standard that the President's men can lie," declared Gingrich. 
He added that he thought North "got caught up in all the talk of patriotism" at 
the White House and got "overextended" in his zeal to carry out Administration 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan himself got so caught up in patriotic fervor and an "us vs. them" 
attitude toward Congress, Gingrich said, that when leaving Washington aboard 
Air Force One the President would joke about "how tempting it would be to bomb 
the Capitol." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who said he was traveling aboard Air Force One with Reagan when he 
made the remark, said that the President's attitude was that "we patriots are 
going to save the West, and those guys on the Hill don't understand."

JURY GETS CASE OF 3 TELEDYNE EXECUTIVES ACCUSED OF HELPING RIG DEFENSE CONTRACT 
</P>

Three Teledyne Industries executives provided "grease for the skids" of an 
elaborate conspiracy to fix a $24-million electronics contract, federal 
prosecutors said in closing arguments Monday shortly before the first trial in 
the Ill Wind Pentagon corruption investigation went to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica said that the three executives -- George H. 
Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer -- authorized payments of $160,000 
knowing that the money would be used to bribe a Navy official to steer the 
contract to Teledyne. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys countered that the three Teledyne officers were innocent 
victims of a conspiracy concocted by four men who already have pleaded guilty 
to fraud and bribery charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teledyne Called Victim 
</P>
<P>
"The only conspiracy was one to defraud Teledyne by these (four) men," said 
Mark Tuohey, a lawyer for Sullivan, former vice president for finance at 
Teledyne Electronics, a Newbury Park subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Teledyne 
Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"They testified with a grant of immunity -- but with a hammer over their 
heads," Tuohey said of the four men who implicated the defendants. "They 
haven't been sentenced yet. They have every motive in the world to save their 
almighty skin." 
</P>
<P>
The Teledyne trial, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Virginia, is seen as a test of the government's ability to prove that corporate 
executives knowingly participated in corrupt acts within the 
$150-billion-a-year Pentagon procurement system. 
</P>
<P>
The government already has obtained the confessions of a dozen private 
consultants and government officials to charges that they bought and sold 
confidential Pentagon data in efforts to subvert the military procurement 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors hope to obtain guilty verdicts in the Teledyne case to prod 
unindicted suspects in the investigation into cooperating with authorities to 
help bring charges against higher-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne admitted its role in the scheme last month and agreed to pay the 
government at least $4.3 million in fines and reimbursements. The company 
blamed its involvement on a former marketing official, Michael Savaides, but it 
maintains that three executives now on trial are innocent. Teledyne is paying 
the defendants' legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Four men -- Savaides, Navy procurement officer Stuart E. Berlin and consultants 
Fred H. Lackner of Woodland Hills, Calif., and William L. Parkin of Alexandria, 
Va. -- already have confessed to criminal fraud and bribery charges. 
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to prove that the Teledyne executives hired Parkin, a 
former high-ranking Navy purchasing official, because of his access to senior 
Defense Department officials who could help the company obtain the electronics 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The three executives looked the other way when presented with clear signals 
that Parkin was using Teledyne money to bribe a former colleague, the 
prosecution alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence clearly establishes that each and every one of the defendants 
entered into a conspiracy," Aronica told the jury. "They are aiders and 
abettors of the bribery of Stuart Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution case is built largely around evidence obtained from wiretaps on 
Parkin's phone. The jury heard Parkin press Schnittjer for money, shortly after 
Schnittjer joined Teledyne Electronics, saying: "Nobody works for nothing any 
more, and it takes a lot of spaghetti and meatballs to grease the skids on some 
of these things." 
</P>
<P>
Schnittjer's lawyer, Stan Mortenson, said that Schnittjer had no idea what 
Parkin was talking about and had no reason to conclude that "spaghetti and 
meatballs" referred to cash payoffs to a Navy official. 
</P>
<P>
The jury received the case Monday afternoon after detailed instructions on the 
charges and the law from District Judge Richard L. Williams. Defense attorneys 
predicted that it would take jurors at least a day and a half to reach a 
verdict in the complicated case. 
</P>
<P>
Kaub faces a sentence of up to 85 years in prison and a fine of up to $2.5 
million if he is found guilty. Sullivan and Schnittjer face sentences of up to 
50 years.

200 EVACUATED IN VENTURA COUNTY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities Monday night evacuated a one-square mile neighborhood of Saticoy in 
Ventura County while firefighters battled a blaze involving possibly hazardous 
materials at a nearby chemical plant. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started at about 6 p.m. at the Pacific Intermediate chemical blending 
company, which manufactures pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
A half-mile section of California 118 was shut down as a precaution because of 
the smoke, and was expected to remain closed through the night, a Ventura 
County fire dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also closed both sides of Los Angeles Avenue and evacuated homes 
on nearby Nardo Street and Rosal Lane, said fire spokeswoman Laura Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross opened an evacuation center at Buena High School in 
Saticoy for the estimated 200 people affected by the order. 
</P>
<P>
A firefighter was taken to Ventura County Medical Center suffering from 
dizziness an nausea. No other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
An inspector reported that three small, separate fires could be seen inside the 
building, Kidd said.

MOTHER CAN SUE FOR DISTRESS, COURT SAYS 
</P>

The state Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that a mother can sue for the 
emotional distress she suffered from the alleged sexual molestation of her 
minor son by a psychotherapist at a medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the woman, who was undergoing counseling along with her son, was 
owed a legal "duty of care" by the therapist. If she can show that duty was 
violated by a molestation, she herself was a victim and can collect damages for 
the negligent infliction of emotional distress, the justices held. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, while limited in scope, does for the first time allow a parent to 
sue for trauma suffered from a child's injury that the parent did not directly 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
The justices held in a landmark 1968 decision that parents who were not victims 
themselves could sue for the distress of seeing the death or serious injury of 
a child. Lower courts have been divided since then over whether a parent must 
be personally present when harm occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the case said it is possible that Monday's ruling will open the 
way for such suits in similar situations. 
</P>
<P>
"With this Supreme Court we can't expect a broad expansion of victims' rights, 
but in this case, a little is better than none," said Russell S. Kussman of Los 
Angeles, attorney for the mother in the case. "Now she (the parent) is able to 
go forward in trial on the theory that she has been a victim of a wrongful act 
of the defendants, as was her son. . . . This is a just ruling." 
</P>
<P>
John G. Kerr of Pasadena, attorney for the psychotherapist named as a 
defendant, called the ruling "very narrow" and one based largely on the unique 
facts of the case. "My sense is that this court is taking a more conservative 
and limited, case-by-case approach to any extension of liability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr also emphasized that the therapist denies any wrongdoing and said he 
believes the allegations were "outrageously" exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1980 when a woman identified by the court only as Marlene F. 
and two other mothers brought their minor sons to the Affiliated Psychiatric 
Medical Clinic Inc. of Rosemead to obtain counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the boys' mothers said they discovered that a therapist had 
sexually molested their sons. They said they confronted the clinic operators, 
who said that the therapist had done nothing "illegal" but that he would no 
longer be assigned to treat minor patients. The therapist said he would undergo 
psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene F. and one of the other mothers brought suit against the clinic, its 
owner and operator and the therapist for negligent infliction of emotional 
distress, saying that they, as parents, had undergone serious mental and 
emotional suffering and that their family relationships had been disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed the case, and in 1987 a state 
Court of Appeal agreed, finding that the mothers were not entitled to sue 
either as "bystanders," as allowed under the high court's 1968 ruling, or as 
"direct victims," as permitted under a 1980 decision by the justices. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers were neither present at the time of the alleged molestation nor 
were they the actual targets of the therapist's reputed misconduct, the 
appellate court said. (Meanwhile, the other mother reached a settlement with 
the defendants and was dropped from the case, leaving Marlene F. as the sole 
plaintiff affected by Monday's ruling, attorneys said.) 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, however, reinstated the suit, noting that the clinic and 
therapist were counseling both parent and child and thus owed a duty to both 
that would open the way for liability if it were violated.

Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita defended contributions that his 
political organization received from a company at the heart of a political 
scandal, saying the Recruit Co. donations were legal. Takeshita, under 
increasing pressure in a scandal that has led to the arrest of 13 people and 
the resignation of three Cabinet ministers, spoke to a parliamentary committee 
in response to recent reports of huge donations to his organization from 
Recruit. Newspapers have reported that Takeshita's political support group 
received about $1 million from Recruit, a publishing and telecommunications 
group, in 1986 and 1987.

Two Turkish merchant ships collided in thick fog in the Adriatic Sea, sinking 
one of the vessels and leaving 14 sailors missing and believed dead, Italian 
port officials said. Ubaldo Scarpati, head of the port authority in 
Manfredonia, in southern Italy, said the 1,700-ton Deval and the 1,713-ton 
Selin, both based in Istanbul, Turkey, collided off the Yugoslav island of 
Palagruza. The island is about halfway between Italy and Yugoslavia. The 
missing crew members were all from the Deval, which sank almost immediately 
after the collision.

TOBACCO TAX CHANGE URGED 
</P>

After being told that cigar smokers are placing their orders through the mail 
to escape California's heavy new tax on tobacco products, the chairman of the 
Joint Legislative Budget Committee said he wants the State Board of 
Equalization to come up with "a fairer" tax. Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights) said he thinks the board, in interpreting Proposition 99, the tobacco 
tax initiative approved by voters last November, has set the tax on selected 
tobacco products so high that it will create a black market and drive 
California tobacco shop owners out of business. He said he will draft a 
legislative resolution asking the tax agency to reduce the new levy.

'STAR WARS' LASER TEST RATED A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-power chemical laser developed for the "Star Wars" program has been 
successfully tested for the first time in a vacuum chamber simulating the 
conditions of space, the Pentagon said. The test, described as "a major 
milestone" by the Defense Department, was conducted Friday at a special 
facility in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. While the so-called Alpha laser 
generated a laser beam for only one-fifth of a second, the initial "first 
light" test was sufficient to verify the theoretical calculations that were 
made in designing the device, said Neil Griff, the program manager for chemical 
lasers with the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Built by TRW of 
Redondo Beach, the Alpha is a hydrogen fluoride chemical laser that produces 
energy from chemical combustion. The device and program so far have cost about 
$200 million, officials said.

Navy veteran and peace activist Scott Rutherford ended a 49-day water-only fast 
aimed at protesting U.S. military aid to the government of El Salvador. "My 
heart and the gracious spirit guided me in the beginning of this fast," he 
said. "They are now telling me that it is time to end it." The fast ended in a 
ceremony outside the gates of the Concord Naval Weapons Station, the longtime 
target of peace activists who charge that it is an embarkation point for U.S. 
weapons headed for Central America. Rutherford, a member of the Nuremberg 
Actions anti-war group, said: "I feel I have done so little for my Salvadoran 
brothers and sisters when so much is called for. Their situation is very 
grave."

Calling whistle-blowers "public servants of the highest order," President Bush 
signed legislation to give more protection to federal employees who expose 
waste, fraud and abuse in government. At a ceremony in the auditorium of the 
Executive Office Building, Bush signed into law the Whistle-blowers Protection 
Act of 1989, which he said is free of the "constitutional flaws" that led 
former President Ronald Reagan to pocket veto a similar bill last October. The 
bill's key features, fundamentally unchanged from the vetoed version, would 
establish a simpler and fairer standard for whistle-blowers to prove 
retaliation by their bosses and would give them the right to appeal their cases 
to the Merit Systems Protection Board if the government's Office of Special 
Counsel fails to do so.

CASE AGAINST SILBERMAN IS DETAILED BY U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESSMAN ARRAIGNED BY MAGISTRATE IN S.D. 
</P>

Richard T. Silberman believed that $300,000 he allegedly laundered for an 
undercover FBI agent came from Colombian cocaine traffickers and boasted to the 
agent that he had been involved in money-laundering ventures numerous times 
before, according to an affidavit unsealed by federal prosecutors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During a wiretapped telephone conversation, Silberman told the agent "this is 
not my first go-around" and said he solicited money-laundering business through 
Chris Petti, an alleged co-conspirator and organized crime figure, because he 
"wanted a little diversification," the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also said he was anxious to move on to "bigger and better things" 
after allegedly completing two laundering transactions negotiated with the 
agent during meetings at several San Diego hotels, the document says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested at Hotel 
</P>
<P>
A wealthy San Diego businessman and powerful player in local and state 
Democratic politics for 15 years, Silberman was arrested by FBI agents Friday 
at the Hyatt Islandia hotel while allegedly arranging to launder $1.1 million 
in funds portrayed to him as proceeds from cocaine sales. The arrest -- along 
with several other transactions conducted during the six months Silberman was 
under FBI scrutiny -- was secretly videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint issued by prosecutors Monday, Silberman, 59, is accused of 
conspiring with Petti and two Los Angeles men still at large to launder 
$300,000 in cash represented by undercover agents to be proceeds of cocaine 
trafficking. He is also charged with violating a federal law requiring that all 
cash financial transactions over $10,000 be reported to the U.S. Treasury 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who is married to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, faces 
20 years in federal prison if convicted of the charges. After spending one 
night in the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, he was released on a 
$500,000 personal surety bond Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formally Charged 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Silberman and Petti, 62, were formally charged before U.S. 
Magistrate Roger McKee and a swarm of reporters and onlookers. Dressed in a 
dark-blue suit and looking somewhat haggard, Silberman was accompanied in court 
by Golding and noted criminal defense attorney Milton J. Silverman, who was 
making a special appearance and had not been retained. 
</P>
<P>
Although prosecutors asked that McKee require Silberman to secure the bond with 
property, the magistrate declined, saying he believed Silberman would honor his 
promise to return to court. McKee, who confiscated Silberman's passport and 
required him to sign a list of standard conditions required of those posting 
bail, scheduled a preliminary hearing for April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Silberman declined to comment. But Golding, wrapping 
her arm tightly around her husband, vowed that Silberman's name would be 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
"He's innocent, that's all there is to it," said Golding, her voice tremulous. 
As for the effect her husband's legal woes may have on her rising career in 
Republican politics, Golding said, "I haven't thought much about that. I'm a 
county supervisor and will continue to be one." 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the couple's brief meeting with reporters, Golding 
whispered, "I love you" to her husband. Silberman then leaned down and kissed 
her on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
As the couple and Silverman walked from the courthouse, another emotional 
episode unfolded when Charlie W. Dozzell -- a 70-year-old shoeshine man at the 
Town and Country Hotel who said he has polished Silberman's shoes for 20 years 
-- approached and wished his customer well. As the two men embraced, Silberman 
broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. said the government has "a very 
strong case" against Silberman and is optimistic that its charges will hold up 
in court. Perhaps most importantly, he said, Silberman was told frequently that 
the source of the agent's money was cocaine trafficking and that such knowledge 
did not dim his desire to do business. 
</P>
<P>
"On several occasions, to make it clear that the money was coming from cocaine 
sales, the agent would say it was furnished by Colombian (drug) traffickers," 
Gorder said. "Silberman would say something like, 'Well, I don't want to hear 
that,' or 'I didn't hear that.' (But) clearly he did." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Silberman and Petti, agents are seeking Darryl Nakatsuka -- also 
known as Darryl Naka -- and Jack Norman Myers. Sources said Myers, 43, of 
Malibu, has been associated with Silberman since both men raised political 
funds for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Myers is the former son-in-law of MCA 
Chairman Lew Wasserman but has been divorced from Wasserman's daughter Lynn for 
about 10 years, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti is being held without bail pending a hearing Thursday. He was serving 
probation for a federal gaming conviction when arrested Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 76-page affidavit -- filed in support of search warrants for Silberman's 
offices at Yuba Natural Resources Inc. on B Street in San Diego and two Los 
Angeles County offices -- provides the first glimpse of how solid a case the 
government may have against Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by FBI Special Agent Charles B. Walker, it details the genesis of the 
laundering deals and the system Silberman allegedly used to dispose of the 
$300,000. The document suggests that evidence against Silberman ranges from the 
wiretapping of more than a dozen telephones to videotapes of cash transfers and 
the negotiating session preceding Silberman's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Among the telephones tapped was a line in Silberman's office provided by the 
California Medical Assistance Commission -- to which Silberman was appointed in 
May, 1986. At one point, the affidavit says, Silberman told an undercover agent 
not to call his primary office phone because the secretaries maintain a record 
of all incoming calls. Many of the negotiations covered by the affidavit were 
made during calls to the Medical Assistance Commission number. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say FBI agents stumbled upon Silberman's alleged activities during 
their 2 1/2-year investigation of Petti. Described in the affidavit as a 
Southern California associate of La Cosa Nostra, an organized crime group in 
Chicago, Petti -- also known as Chris George Poulos -- served nine months for a 
bookmaking conviction and was placed on probation in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, FBI agents began trailing Petti and unidentified others in 
connection with their alleged organized crime ties. The investigation involved 
the use of wiretaps and other electronic monitoring, the affidavit says. Among 
other things, the surveillance of Petti disclosed that he was allegedly engaged 
in a series of extortions against people who owed money to the late Anthony 
Spilotro of Las Vegas, a member of the Chicago organized crime family who was 
murdered in 1986, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Silberman proposed a laundering scheme to Petti, telling him he 
could "get money out of the country, launder it, and realize a profit at the 
same time," the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Petti then allegedly set up a meeting with Robert Benjamin, a convicted felon 
from Los Angeles who became a cooperating witness for the FBI in 1986. 
Benjamin, a longtime acquaintance of Petti, provided a cover story telling 
Petti he was living free in a La Costa apartment owned by a New Jersey man who 
laundered money for Colombian cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Petti arranged for Silberman to meet Benjamin's New Jersey contact on Nov. 9, 
1988, at the coffee shop at the Stardust Hotel and Country Club, the affidavit 
says. The New Jersey associate was in fact an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silberman said he was not interested in laundering less than $500,000, 
the agent insisted on a "test" run of $100,000, and Silberman agreed, the 
affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
As details of the deal were hammered out during more meetings and wiretapped 
telephone conversations, Silberman was told that the undercover agent 
represented Colombians whose money was "not legitimate." During one monitored 
call to Silberman, the agent said of his associates, "all they know is coke and 
they don't know nothing else." And in a meeting with Silberman in February, the 
agent called his sources "a bunch of . . . Colombian cocaine drug lords." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's responses to such remarks -- as quoted in wiretap transcripts 
included in the affidavit -- make it clear he knew the source of the money. In 
one instance, after the agent referred to "the drug types" he worked for, 
Silberman said, "Let's us not even . . . use any of the words anymore, OK?" 
Later, he said, "You and I never have to use the word." 
</P>
<P>
In November, the undercover agent and Silberman began mapping plans for the 
first "test" deal, involving $100,000 in federal money, the affidavit says. 
During a taped conversation on Nov. 12, Silberman assured the agent that he was 
a veteran of such laundering operations. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, just for your background, this is not my first go-around, OK. 
I've been here before," Silberman is quoted in the affidavit. "I just wanted a 
little diversification and that's why I went to Chris." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman added that he could handle "five very big ones" and that "all the 
guys I deal with" think that it's a real good deal if they pay 20% to get the 
money "from here to there," the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of the $100,000 was made Nov. 30 when Nakatsuka picked up the 
money from the undercover agent at the Airport Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, a 
pick-up that was videotaped. Those funds were apparently to be used in a stock 
swap involving Yuba American Gold, Ltd., a subsidiary of Yuba Natural Resources 
formed in April, 1987. Prosecutors, however, say details of Silberman's plans 
for the money are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eager for More 
</P>
<P>
Touting his accomplishments in conversations that were wiretapped after the 
first transaction, Silberman told the undercover agent he was eager to 
negotiate more deals involving larger sums. During a monitored conversation on 
Dec. 2, Silberman told the agent that he hoped the agent realized "you're 
dealing with something . . . I've done . . . 15, 20 years a lot of different 
ways," according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also told the agent that he hoped, "by now, you're satisfied that 
it's first class, it's not normal and there's a lot more potential if we got 
active," the court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 22, the second transaction -- involving $200,000 of federal money -- 
occurred. It was also videotaped. Those funds were used to purchase zero coupon 
bonds with the help of Myers, who used a connection at a Westlake stock 
brokerage house to obtain a favorable rate. The affidavit said Silberman stood 
to receive a commission of between 6 and 12 points for his laundering services 
and intended to pay a fee to Petti as well. 
</P>
<P>
After the second transaction, the undercover agent complained that the bonds 
turned over to him in a Hyatt Islandia hotel room were $50,000 short. That fact 
prompted the undercover agent to hesitate in negotiating additional deals with 
Silberman, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Angry about the snafu, Silberman told the undercover agent that the employees 
of the stock brokerage firm he used for the transfer were normally reliable but 
apparently were "playing games." If the firm failed to rectify the situation, 
Silberman promised to bring in some of Petti's "friends" and have them use 
"muscle" to express his displeasure "in no uncertain terms." 
</P>
<P>
In building their case against Silberman, the FBI made wide use of newly 
authorized "roving wiretaps." Among the phones that were tapped were pay phones 
at the Stardust Hotel and the Plaza International Hotel frequently used by 
Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who served as secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency 
under former Gov. Brown, has been a key player in statewide Democratic politics 
for 15 years. He was Brown's chief fund-raiser in his 1976 presidential 
campaign and had a similar role in Brown's failed bid in 1980. On the local 
scene, he joined the movement that ended the reign of C. Arnholt Smith and 
helped elect Mayor Pete Wilson and Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Active in Business 
</P>
<P>
He has been equally active on the business side. In 1968, he made a fortune 
when the Jack in the Box restaurant chain -- in which he was a general partner 
-- was sold to Ralston Purina Co. He also teamed up with Robert O. Peterson to 
take over First National Bank, later renamed California First Bank. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, Silberman's financial success has been less impressive. 
He became an officer in Yuba Natural Resources in the 1980s, and lately the 
company -- which mines for gold in Yuba County north of Sacramento -- has not 
been faring well. It lost a total of $6.5 million during the four fiscal years 
from 1984 through 1987 and would have lost money in 1988 had it not been for 
the $5-million sale of land and mineral rights. For the first nine months of 
the current fiscal year, Yuba is running a $2.6-million deficit.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday that his government has no 
plans to change the way it is handling the uprising in the occupied territories 
as part of its latest bid to bring peace to the region. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't depend on the Israeli government," he told a news conference during 
a visit here with Midwestern Jewish leaders. "The existing tension is a result 
of acts of violence carried out by the people of the intifada (the Arabic name 
of the uprising). 
</P>
<P>
"The moment this violence will stop or be reduced, then the tension will 
disappear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising, now 17 months old, has taken more than 400 lives, the great bulk 
of them Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has proposed elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for the 
selection of negotiators who would deal with Israel on the permanent status of 
the areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization and the Arab League both rejected 
Shamir's election proposal Monday. In Tunisia, a PLO spokesman said the idea is 
"totally unacceptable" since the elections would be held "in the shadow of 
Israeli occupation." 
</P>
<P>
The PLO said that elections should be held under international supervision 
after Israel has withdrawn.

ISRAEL COLONEL FORCED TO RESIGN OVER VIOLENCE AGAINST ARABS

Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, has forced a colonel to 
resign after investigations of attacks on Palestinians by soldiers under the 
officer's command, a military source said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Maariv said it was the harshest action taken in more than a 
decade against an officer of such high rank serving in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
The military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Col. Yehuda Meir 
decided to step down and leave the army after Shomron told him he must either 
quit or stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Meir, who was military governor of Nablus in the occupied West Bank at the 
start of the Palestinian uprising, was investigated in connection with two 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
One of these was a widely reported case last year in Kfar Salem near Nablus, 
where troops under Meir's command used a bulldozer to bury four Palestinians 
under piles of sand, the newspaper said. The victims survived. 
</P>
<P>
Another inquiry involved the beatings of two Palestinian teen-agers in Nablus, 
one of them with a stone. The attack was filmed by American television cameras. 
Those youths also survived. 
</P>
<P>
Meir was removed from his Nablus post after these incidents and reassigned 
elsewhere, the military source said. He was later investigated on suspicion of 
"inappropriate behavior" for these actions, prompting Shomron's action, the 
source added. 
</P>
<P>
Maariv said the last high-ranking officer to step down over actions in the 
territories was a brigadier general removed by then-Defense Minister Ezer 
Weizman after tear gas was fired at a school in the West Bank town of Beit Jala 
in May, 1978.

USDA CALLS DUNDA DISCIPLINE EXCESSIVE IN LETTER OF WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discipline applied by San Diego Wild Animal Park keepers to Dunda the 
elephant in February, 1988, exceeded acceptable measures under federal 
regulations concerning the handling of animals, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture concludes in a letter of warning to the Zoological Society of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The April 6 letter said that results of an investigation by the department's 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) show "repeated disciplinary 
measures" on Feb. 17 and 18, 1988, to the 18-year-old female African elephant 
"did cause bruising and damage to the skin on the elephant's head and signs of 
behavioral stress." 
</P>
<P>
James W. Glosser, the administrator of APHIS, reminded the Zoological Society 
of federal law regarding animal treatment. "Handling of animals shall be done 
as expeditiously and carefully in a way so as not to cause unnecessary 
discomfort, behavioral stress, or physical harm to the animal," Glosser wrote. 
"Care should be exercised also to avoid harm to the handler." 
</P>
<P>
Glosser said that while zoos obviously require animal control and discipline to 
assure both the safety of animals and the public, "We must warn you that any 
further documented use of such excessive disciplinary measures (as occurred 
with Dunda) may result in legal action to secure compliance" with federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
Zoological Society spokesman Jeff Jouett said Monday that its officials 
disagree with the letter's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand by our own investigation and the investigations by the San Diego 
Humane Society, the San Diego city attorney, and the American Assn. of 
Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which found that Dunda's short disciplinary 
training sessions were not excessive and did not cause unnecessary discomfort," 
Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said that USDA inspectors lack expertise in handling exotic, or zoo 
animals, because their usual experience has been in dealing with domesticated 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to work closely with the USDA to develop elephant-training 
guidelines that are beneficial for elephants, and to allow their keepers to 
work safely," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sessions Criticized as Brutal 
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials maintain that the discipline, which included chaining Dunda's 
legs, pulling her to the ground, and beating her on the head with ax handles 
for short periods, was necessary to train Dunda not to lash out and try to 
injure her keepers. The incident occurred shortly after Dunda was transferred 
to the Wild Animal Park from the San Diego Zoo, where she had spent most of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Dunda's former keepers at the zoo criticized the sessions as 
unnecessary and brutal, but the numerous subsequent investigations produced 
conflicting conclusions. While the San Diego Humane Society and city attorney's 
office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone on 
animal cruelty charges, the Humane Society of the United States called the 
incident a clear case of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The incident raised questions of how elephant discipline is handled at zoos 
around the world and whether changes need to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), who took an active interest in the case and 
has introduced legislation to ban zoo elephant rides and limit types of 
discipline, said Monday he was pleased at the USDA letter. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are on the outside and unrelated to the city and zoo have said 
there was excessive force used, and those that have close ties (to the zoo) 
have tried to smooth the issue over, so I'm satisfied with what the (USDA) did 
and it did give a good strong warning and said clearly it will be watching 
things in the future," McCorquodale said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prohibitions Under Legislation 
</P>
<P>
His legislation, on which a public hearing will be held in the state Senate 
later this month, would prohibit elephant discipline that involved use of 
electricity, deprivation of food, water or rest, or any action that results in 
damages, scars or breaks in the skin. It would also prohibit insertion of any 
instrument into an animal's bodily orifices. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the zoo will look back on this in hindsight and say that what was 
done was not a good thing and go on and try to rebuild its image as it existed 
in the past," McCorquodale said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said that the zoo, while it disagrees with the USDA and will so respond, 
"is onto other things" as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two elephants now pregnant, three others are suspected of being 
pregnant, and we expect an elephant birth in August," Jouett said. Dunda is not 
yet ready for a mate, however, because she needs more time to be fully accepted 
into the Wild Animal Park herd, he said.

UTILITY MERGER PROMISES LIKENED TO BRIBE OFFERS; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER SDG&amp;E DIRECTOR SAYS JOB CONTRACTS HELPED SOFTEN OPPOSITION FROM 
EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SCEcorp's promises of seats on its board for select San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric board members in the wake of a proposed merger between Southern 
California Edison and SDG&amp;E constituted "bribes," former SDG&amp;E board 
member Charles (Red) Scott said Monday during a daylong deposition conducted by 
attorneys representing the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who resigned from SDG&amp;E's board in December to protest the proposed 
merger, also testified that Edison softened opposition to the merger among key 
SDG&amp;E executives -- including SDG&amp;E Chairman Thomas Page -- through 
offers of lucrative employment contracts. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E executives subsequently used "devious" methods to mask the true 
monetary value of those contracts, according to Scott. The former board member 
described Page's proposed employment contract as "clearly an inducement to 
influence Mr. Page." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tainted' Deliberations 
</P>
<P>
Those offers of board seats and employment contracts "poisoned or tainted" 
deliberations by SDG&amp;E board members who, on Nov. 30, followed management's 
advice and approved the proposed $2.4-billion, stock-swap merger, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott on Monday became the second former board member to testify that SCEcorp's 
pre-vote offers swayed SDG&amp;E board members and officers. Last Tuesday, O. 
Morris Sievert also claimed that the offers by SCEcorp affected the board vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Logic tells me that (the contracts) must have" influenced SDG&amp;E's 
executives as they concluded negotiations with Edison, Scott said. "That is my 
greatest concern." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, chairman of La Jolla-based Intermark, said that in mid-November he 
noticed an abrupt change in how the board viewed the proposed merger with 
Rosemead-based Edison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returned From Trip 
</P>
<P>
Scott returned that month from an out-of-town business trip "thinking that we, 
the directors and management were going to stand with our arms locked together 
and fight those bastards to the last drop of air was left . . . (But) I came 
back to town and we had broken ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked and surprised that some of the people who were leading the 
charge to fight the (Edison offer) had switched and were now in favor of it," 
Scott said. "When it first was announced, Mr. Page was adamantly against it and 
he solicited our support to stand behind him and not let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Scott also testified that he felt "shock and horror" upon realizing that 
Salomon Brothers, a New York-based investment firm, would reap a financial 
windfall if the Edison merger were completed. Salomon, which SDG&amp;E hired to 
evaluate Edison's stock-swap offer, "profited by our being bought by Edison," 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional $4 Million 
</P>
<P>
According to SDG&amp;E's proxy statement, the local utility has agreed to pay 
Salomon up to $5.25 million, including a $3.25-million payment if the proposed 
merger with Edison is completed. Salomon also has received an additional $4 
million in payments from Edison since 1986, according to the proxy. 
</P>
<P>
Scott complained that his protest against the Salomon contract generated 
rebukes from SDG&amp;E's executives. "It was obvious I was being spanked" for 
questioning top utility managers about the fee arrangement with Salomon, Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During his wide-ranging, day-long appearance at the deposition, Scott described 
Edison's initial merger offer, in July, 1988, as "a bad deal . . . . I don't 
recall anybody in the room having anything good to say about the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Doubts 
</P>
<P>
Board members, he maintained, had serious doubts that Edison Chairman Howard 
Allen would keep his promised 10% rate cut for SDG&amp;E's residential 
customers. The promised rate reduction was "so much B.S.," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said that he grew irritated as time went by because Page wanted a 
unanimous vote in favor of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Page was in effect asking him to "sprinkle holy water on a transaction I 
thought was wrong," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, mirroring testimony presented last week by former SDG&amp;E board member 
Sievert, said that SDG&amp;E's board members had inadequate information upon 
which to base their vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lip Service' 
</P>
<P>
Scott testified that board members gave "half-hearted lip service" to the 
proposed merger's effect upon SDG&amp;E customers, and talked only briefly 
about the environmental impacts and the number of SDG&amp;E employees who might 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Sievert appeared at the depositions only after being subpoenaed by 
the city of San Diego, which is actively contesting the proposed utility merger 
in proceedings before the state Public Utilities Commission. However, both men 
agreed to discuss actions that led to the board's Nov. 30 vote. 
</P>
<P>
However, SDG&amp;E has maintained that Sievert and Scott cannot testify about 
advice offered by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, a New York law firm 
that is advising SDG&amp;E on legal matters surrounding the merger. Scott and 
Sievert have agreed to withhold testimony about the law firm until after a law 
judge rules on SDG&amp;E's contention.

FOUR COUNTY SCHOOL GROUPS LAG IN STATE WRITING SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eighth-grade writing scores improved overall in California schools, but four 
Orange County public school districts fell below the state average this year, 
state education test results showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Orange County school districts showed declines in writing scores, 
although they remained above the state average, according to the state 
Department of Education, which released results of a second year of testing 
eighth-grade students for their writing abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Because Orange County has a higher average income and education level for 
adults than the rest of the state, the county's school districts usually score 
well above state averages in statewide academic tests. 
</P>
<P>
But results this year showed that Anaheim Union High School District, La Habra 
Elementary School District, Santa Ana Unified School District and Westminster 
Elementary School District all had writing scores below the state average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Were Behind Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Only two Orange County school districts -- Anaheim Union High School and Garden 
Grove Unified -- scored below the state average last year, the first year of 
the new writing tests for eighth-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Unified this year showed a 20-point increase, bringing its ranking 
above the state average. But Anaheim Union High School District fell below the 
state average in writing for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
The four school districts in the county scoring lower this year than last, but 
still above state average, were Capistrano Unified, Irvine Unified, Ocean View 
Elementary and Los Alamitos Unified. Los Alamitos dropped 19 points this year, 
compared to last, but remained well above the state average. Capistrano 
Unified, Irvine Unified and Ocean View all showed very slight declines of one 
or two points this year. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda Unified School District, which had a writing score well above state 
average last year for its eighth-graders, did even better this year. The 
district jumped 54 points -- the biggest improvement gain this year among the 
21 Orange County school districts with eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new writing program in our school system, and we expect to do even 
better next year," Brea-Olinda Supt. Edgar Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the four school districts in the county with scores below the state 
average, the test scores were disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"The scores in our school district are not only a disappointment, they are also 
a mystery, because we simply don't know why our scores are lower," Westminster 
Elementary School District Assistant Supt. Keith Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
The overall state test results released Monday in Sacramento showed that 62% of 
the state's eighth-graders wrote adequate or marginally adequate essays. Twelve 
percent wrote impressively, and 22% wrote poorly, according to the results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 of 6 Essays 
</P>
<P>
The statewide exam, begun last year, asks students to write one of six specific 
types of essays -- such as an autobiographical sketch or an informative report. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, 271,168 eighth-graders took the writing exam. Each student was 
given 45 minutes to write an essay. Each exam was given a score ranging from 1 
to 6, which state officials translated into a scaled score running from about 
100 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
The average score statewide rose 6 points this year from last year, going from 
250 to 256. State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Monday that he is 
very pleased with the increases. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 17 of the 21 school districts with eighth grades had overall 
scores higher than the statewide average of 256. For the second year in a row, 
the top-scoring Orange County district in eighth-grade writing was Laguna Beach 
Unified with a current test score of 344, compared to 335 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Like Brea-Olinda Unified, Laguna Beach Unified has only one middle school (or 
junior high) with an eighth grade. Other school districts in the county 
generally have several eighth-grade schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Edged Laguna 
</P>
<P>
One school in Fountain Valley actually scored higher than the Laguna Beach 
district. Eighth-grade students at Fulton School scored 366, the highest in 
Orange County on the writing tests this year. Last year, that honor went to 
Marine View School in Huntington Beach. Marine View this year had a score more 
than 100 points above the state average -- its tally of 359 slightly trailing 
Fulton School but ahead of Laguna Beach's overall district score. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified School District last year scored above the state average in 
eighth-grade writing, despite having a high percentage of new immigrant 
students who know little English. The writing tests are given in English. Santa 
Ana Unified's score this year was 248, or 8 points below the state average of 
256. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the scores this year reflect an increase in the 
limited-English-proficient students we have in our district," Santa Ana Unified 
Assistant Supt. Anthony Dalessi said. "This year, we gained 2,000 new LEP 
(limited-English-proficient) students, and our district is now 52% LEP, 
compared to 50% a year ago. So there is a reason for our score. 
</P>
<P>
"But having said that, I can still say our district wants to be above state 
average, as we were last year, and we will be working to improve our scores," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Concern' 
</P>
<P>
An official at Anaheim Union High School District on Monday expressed "a little 
concern" about the eighth-grade writing again falling below the statewide 
average. But the new test scores "don't mean we're qualitatively lower, but 
that we're qualitatively different," said Jim Cox, the Anaheim district's 
director of research and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new test; it's only in its second year, and for us, it's one of 
those cases where the test came before the change in curriculum," Cox said, 
explaining that the Anaheim district is revising its curriculum to reflect 
state-ordered changes for all language arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Literature is quite heavily involved in that (new) curriculum, and we've 
emphasized literature," he said. "The last element (of the new curriculum) 
we've implemented is writing, and I'm guessing that some districts introduced 
writing first (in making curriculum changes)." 
</P>
<P>
"Because the state writing program and the state writing test is very, very 
sophisticated, it's going to take some time for our writing curriculum to reach 
the level we want. But we will be there," Cox pledged. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Elementary School District Assistant Supt. Ruth Fehr noted that while 
scores for her district were down this year, they were within "comparison 
bands," meaning that the school district's scores were about the same as other 
districts having the same socio-economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Know the Reason 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know any particular reason (for the writing scores to be down this 
year)," Fehr said. "We have a writing program we're committed to, and it begins 
in the first grade. We also have strong emphasis on writing in our new language 
arts curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to continue to work to get those scores up," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The writing test results released Monday also showed a decrease for Los Angeles 
Unified School District -- the largest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified had an average score of 208 this year -- markedly below the 
256 statewide average -- and a point lower than the district's 209 score last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Many educators nationwide consider the California exam state-of-the-art. 
According to the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based research 
group that advises states on educational policy, the majority of the 22 states 
that test students' writing used the California test as their model. 
</P>
<P>
Because thousands of essays must be read, scoring is a laborious process. Last 
year, 384 teachers in six locations around the state spent six days grading the

<P>
The state computes a school-wide and district score but not individual student 
scores. The test is designed to show a school the strengths and weaknesses in 
its approach to the teaching of writing.

ABORTION FOES SAY POLICE USED TOO MUCH FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
LAST OF PROTEST PARTICIPANTS ARE RELEASED FROM JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The last of seven demonstrators jailed during a weekend abortion protest in 
Hillcrest have been released from County Jail amid charges that police used 
excessive force and brutality in arresting 117 people during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Phelps, one of the leaders of the protest, said 25 of the nearly 250 
Project Rescue demonstrators received "minor to serious" injuries -- the worst 
being a broken arm suffered by Ken Fisher, an electrical worker. He was one of 
the many who sang, prayed and read Scripture while attempting to block the 
entrances to the 3rd Avenue offices of Dr. Donald G. Byrnes. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said the other injuries ranged from torn ligaments in the wrist to 
bruises on the face and neck. She said some of the protesters are contemplating 
individual legal action against the San Diego Police Department and the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took the 'Minimum Force' 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Dave Cohen vehemently denied that police used excessive force 
and disputed the protesters' contention that they did not resist arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We took whatever level of force was necessary to move people -- no more," 
Cohen said. "In some cases, no force was necessary because people got up and 
walked to the vans. In those cases where people decided not to cooperate, we 
took whatever minimum force was necessary to get their cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he witnessed most of the arrests, which occurred shortly after 10 
a.m. Saturday, and that he "didn't see anybody punched or kicked. I saw close 
to 100 arrests, and I didn't see anybody abused." 
</P>
<P>
In all, 117 protesters were arrested on misdemeanor trespassing charges, with 
seven of them also charged on suspicion of felony conspiracy. One of the seven 
was released Saturday, the six others Sunday. Those arrested on misdemeanors 
were not booked into jail. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the protesters went limp when confronted by police, a tactic Cohen said 
constituted resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pain-Compliance' Measures 
</P>
<P>
Protesters have sharply criticized the use of "pain-compliance" measures, which 
Cohen said were necessary to dispel the crowd and get the demonstrators to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"You get somebody to move by applying pressure at the right spot," Cohen said. 
"It's extremely painful, and it's taught . . . as a pain-compliance point. 
There is no permanent damage, but, yes, it's painful." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly controversial was the use of nunchaku, which Cohen described as 
two pieces of 12-inch plastic-like material that are connected by 4 inches of 
diamond-braid nylon cord. 
</P>
<P>
"Nunchaku is used primarily to do a wrist hold," Cohen said. "It's used to gain 
compliance over someone without having to strike them. It reduces the 
likelihood of injury. It's a non-lethal tool for restraining and controlling 
suspects. Could it be used in an offensive manner? I suppose it could, but in 
this instance, it was being used strictly as a defensive tool." 
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints about the police, anti-abortion advocates pronounced 
Saturday's protest a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Three children were saved from murder by two separate women (one carrying 
twins) being counseled and persuaded not to go through with having their 
abortions," said the Rev. Mick McCoy, pastor of Vineyard Christian Fellowship 
in El Cajon and a leader of Project Rescue, the local adjunct of the national 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van With Anti-Abortion Sign 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said the women were approached as they prepared to enter the offices of 
Byrnes, who runs O-B Medical Group at 3330 3rd Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes said he knew as early as last Tuesday that his office would be the 
probable target of a demonstration. He said his daughter had noticed someone 
taking pictures of the building and then driving off in a van bearing a large 
sign that read "Abortion Is Murder." 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes said demonstrators entered his waiting room under the pretense of having 
made a medical appointment, then screamed "You're a murderer!" at several 
patients who were waiting to see him. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my patients that day were Mexican," he said, "and they just thought 
those people were crazy. Most of my other patients have called in, offering me 
support and encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's demonstration followed a series of larger ones in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties two weeks ago. On March 25, more than 700 anti-abortion 
activists who were blockading a Los Angeles clinic were arrested. Three weeks 
ago, Project Rescue demonstrated in front of a doctor's office in Escondido, 
but no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, thousands of pro-abortion activists marched on Washington in a 
protest whose size was said to have matched the largest there ever.

Attorneys for rival radio stations filled a federal courtroom with chatter 
Monday as KABC sought a temporary restraining order to force KFI to quit using 
the words, "Talk Radio." 
</P>
<P>
KABC claims that it invented the phrase in 1972 and has used it at least a 
hundred times a day since. 
</P>
<P>
KFI, which adopted the talk format last year, had begun with the slogan, 
"Talkin' Southern California" (though several hours of its programs are taped 
elsewhere). Then, last month the station started its talk-radio talk. KFI's 
attorneys pointed out that the station is always careful to utter the mouthful, 
"Talk Radio KFI AM 640," to avoid confusion. 
</P>
<P>
It's a battle of former sister stations inasmuch as Earle C. Anthony, the late 
Packard dealer, founded both KFI and KABC (then KECA) more than half a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. declined to issue a temporary 
restraining order. But he set a hearing for April 28 to decide whether to issue 
a preliminary injunction against KFI, which would be the industry equivalent of 
"Shut Up Radio." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of gasoline is on the increase, but Louis Wichinsky isn't concerned. 
His 1980 Volkswagen runs on vegetable oil. 
</P>
<P>
Wichinsky, 70, was in town Monday, hoping that someone would take him 
seriously. He showed off the "float chamber, reservoir and modulator" that he's 
added to his engine as well as the five-gallon tank of vegetable oil he keeps 
in his back seat. The license plates on the car read DEEP FRY. 
</P>
<P>
"No pollution. I get about 40 miles to the gallon, only costs about a buck per 
gallon," said Wichinsky, who's also invented a bagel-cutting machine. 
</P>
<P>
Interview over, he turned on the ignition of his car. It smelled like a 
short-order cook's kitchen. It burped a couple of times and then made a 
sizzling exit. 
</P>
<P>
Even for the freeways it was an unusual scene: 
</P>
<P>
Authorities arrested and hospitalized a Tustin woman who was found standing in 
the middle lane of the northbound Santa Ana Freeway late Monday morning, 
alternately exposing herself and swinging a large chain. She reportedly struck 
several passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Lyle Whitten said the woman had also been 
observed tearing up money while atop the hood of her car on a freeway shoulder 
in the Santa Fe Springs area. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told authorities that she had run out of gas and "was trying to get 
someone's attention." But officers said the car started up immediately. 
</P>
<P>
A sad story -- in a couple of respects. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses told us," Whitten said, "that other drivers did stop to pick up some 
of the money." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's a sign that this hasn't been the most thrilling mayoral election 
in history. Or maybe it's simply that celebrities are such common sights around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
When Mayor Tom Bradley took a campaign swing through Century City the other 
day, His Honor was mostly ignored, except when he walked up to someone and 
introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Bradley was standing outside a yogurt shop when an elderly lady 
seated at a bench spotted him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mayor!" she said, sounding genuinely surprised. "Are you lost?" 
</P>
<P>
Was it the latest workout for heavyweight champ Mike Tyson? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says a Hollywood parking lot attendant who contends that he lost on 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Devine, 33, said Tyson struck him in the stomach with the back of his 
hand early Monday morning after he tried to keep the champ and two other men 
from taking a reserved parking spot near the Palace night club. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they hadn't yet confirmed the allegations and noted that Devine 
appeared to have suffered no bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson has faced a similar accusation here once before. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, he allegedly made a pass at a female attendant at the Greek 
Theatre, and when her supervisor intervened, Tyson allegedly struck him with 
the butt of his open hand. Tyson later gave the supervisor an out-of-court 
purse said to be in excess of $100,000.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
NAVAL DEPOT RED FOXES GIVEN A BRIEF REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge extended an order barring the Navy from killing or maiming red 
foxes in a wildlife sanctuary at the Seal Beach Weapons Station until another 
hearing on the matter Thursday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher made the decision Monday to give federal 
attorneys more time to gather evidence to support their contention that the red 
foxes must be killed to protect two species of endangered birds that nest in 
the 1,100-acre Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge on the military property. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County-based group, the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., sued the U.S. 
Navy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1986 to stop the killing of 
foxes, a predator not native to the area. The foxes, according to government 
biologists, prey on the eggs of the light-footed clapper rail and the 
California lest tern, two endangered bird species that inhabit the marshy 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Kelleher issued a temporary restraining order last week that allows the Navy to 
continue trapping and removing the foxes, but he prohibited killing the 
animals. Attorneys for Animal Lovers had sought the injunction after learning 
that a handful of red foxes had been killed in recent weeks by federal 
biologists. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have argued that it has become increasingly difficult to find 
homes outside the area for the foxes because of their predatory nature and 
ability to breed rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after Monday's hearing, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner 
said the federal government "intends to pursue all legal activities necessary 
to protect" the birds in the sanctuary, including the removal of the foxes.

THE A-WORD;

<P>
OUTSIDER POLITICAL GROUP IN PASADENA NOW ON THE INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the days before liberal became the L-word, in Pasadena there was the A-word: 
ACT. 
</P>
<P>
ACT was a group of young political activists devoted to advancing liberal 
causes in a city that had never voted for a Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
Members flung themselves into losing campaigns, debated esoteric points of 
politics and took stands that seemed so out of step with mainstream Pasadena 
that endorsements were never publicized for fear they would be "the kiss of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
"No one in their right mind took these people seriously," said Bess Licher, a 
longtime conservative booster. "For that matter, who knew they existed?" 
</P>
<P>
But after years of fighting the Establishment, ACT has become part of it and is 
considered one of the most sophisticated campaign organizations in the San 
Gabriel Valley city. 
</P>
<P>
Although the group is virtually unknown to voters, its members sit on most city 
commissions and form a majority on the Board of Directors and the school board. 
Since 1980, ACT-endorsed candidates have won in 26 of 30 municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
Its foundations may have been in ideology, but the organization's success is 
due largely to technology -- specifically, its use of computers. 
</P>
<P>
ACT has compiled a computer listing of all the people who have voted in 
municipal elections since 1979. Only candidates who are endorsed by the group 
receive the list, which allows them to concentrate on those who have a history 
of going to the polls, thereby saving time and money. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the list is hard to quantify, but among liberal and conservative 
candidates, it has become almost an American Express Card of politics -- don't 
campaign without it. 
</P>
<P>
While ACT leaders are proud of its growth into a political power, some members, 
such as Christopher Sutton, a Pasadena attorney and one of its founding 
members, say it may have become too cautious and pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal candidates that ACT would have endorsed in the past have been ignored, 
partly because no one thought they could win, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
The group also has had difficulty finding its position on two of the most 
pressing issues in Pasadena this decade: slow growth and historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
ACT loyalists say the group is not abandoning its liberal tradition, but they 
agree it is a the band of idealists who came together 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always more fun to be on the inside than on the outside," said Jonathan 
S. Fuhrman, a founding member. "Losing was noble, but it was never fun." 
</P>
<P>
ACT, which is not an acronym, only surfaces at election time, and even then it 
usually remains in the background -- it does not run its own candidates or 
contribute any significant amounts of labor or money. 
</P>
<P>
The group is never involved in policy debates at City Hall, has no platform on 
issues. It is run by a 25-member steering committee and claims a membership of 
600. Anyone can join for $25. Many candidates encourage their relatives and 
children to join to increase the chances of getting an endorsement, which 
requires a 60% affirmative vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is the list," said city Director Jess Hughston, who won a 
close campaign with ACT's help in 1985. "You'd be foolish to campaign without 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of ACT can be traced to George McGovern's unsuccessful 1972 
presidential campaign. Pasadena was a conservative city, deeply split over a 
1970 federal court decision ordering busing to integrate the Pasadena Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
Founders of the group sought to recall board members who fought busing and 
campaigned for liberal candidates, although it never was able to match the 
money or organization of the conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
But in the late 1970s, Pat Bond and Fred Register, two members who have become 
professional political consultants, found a winning strategy. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical municipal election, no more than about 20% of the city's 
registered voters go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Bond and Register figured that instead of squandering money on those who stayed 
home, candidates could concentrate mailings and phone calls on those who 
actually vote. 
</P>
<P>
In every local election, a voter's identification number is recorded by the 
city clerk. By matching those numbers with voter registration information kept 
by the county, the group compiled a list of dedicated voters, including their 
addresses, telephone numbers, ages and party affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized list became known as the "Elf List" after the "elves" who 
invaded City Hall to transcribe the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the list played an important role in the successful campaign on 
behalf of the slow-growth initiative sponsored by Pasadena Residents in Defense 
of our Environment (PRIDE). 
</P>
<P>
Mike Salazar, co-chairman of PRIDE, said that because of the measure's 
complexity, the election hinged on a mail and phone campaign. The group raised 
$34,000 -- contrasted with about $95,000 for its opposition -- but was able to 
target 9,000 of the city's 66,000 registered voters who were most likely to go 
to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"The ACT endorsement had a big role," Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Phelps, chairman of the group opposing the PRIDE measure, said it might 
have been smarter to encourage supporters to join ACT and seize the 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Success has brought its share of change. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, other groups have begun compiling the same voter list. A private 
political consulting firm offers a similar list for about $300, although it 
only covers Pasadena elections back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some candidates have begun wondering if ACT has lost its 
liberal bent.

DEMOCRATS PUT PRINGLE RECALL ON BACK BURNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A move to recall Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has been put on hold 
by Orange County Democrats in the wake of a recent advisory opinion that 
appears to exempt recall elections from campaign spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion, issued by the state Fair Political Practices Commission in March, 
said recall elections are not restricted by spending ceilings imposed by 
Proposition 73, which was passed by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
Local Democrats said they fear now that Pringle, as an incumbent Republican, 
could raise whatever money he needs to defend himself against the recall 
effort, which Democrats had expected would be run on a shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
The recall is "not dead," said Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Michael 
J. Balmages. But in light of the advisory, "we had to reconsider and still are 
reconsidering what we need to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Than 900 Votes 
</P>
<P>
Pringle won the 72nd Assembly District seat last November by less than 900 
votes after a bitter $1.9-million battle. The election is still mired in legal 
controversy over the Orange County Republican Party's hiring of uniformed 
security guards for 20 Santa Ana precincts in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The guards were hired at the suggestion of Pringle's campaign manager, who has 
said he was motivated by rumors that Democrats would try to bus in voters from 
other areas to tip the election in their favor. Democrats and Latino groups 
have charged that the guards intimidated voters, especially Latinos who may 
have been casting ballots for the first time since becoming citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Also 
pending is a civil lawsuit filed by several Latinos who say they were 
confronted by the guards as they tried to vote. 
</P>
<P>
FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Monday that the commission believes that 
recalls would be defined as ballot measure elections rather than elections 
involving candidacies. Only candidates come under the Proposition 73 
contribution limits, which are $1,000 for individuals, $2,500 for political 
committees and $5,000 for so-called "broad-based" political committees, under 
the commission's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said the commission's advice is that candidates must establish 
specific campaign committees for recall elections. Money contributed to those 
committees could not be used for other purposes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the FPPC advisory, Balmages said local Democrats will wait to see 
what happens in the investigation and the lawsuit. He said he and other 
Democratic leaders agreed "not to initiate a recall until we get something very 
solid" out of either the court or the investigative agencies regarding the use 
of the guards. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said he and other local Democrats met with Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) in Orange County about 10 days ago to talk about the 
recall and other matters, and agreed that a recall of Pringle would be "very,

COUNTY TEACHER SENTENCED FOR BANKING SCHEME

<P>
An Orange County teacher was sentenced to 3 years in prison Monday for 
violating federal banking laws, a pattern of activity the judge said was 
probably part of a scheme to launder drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Hoyland, a former science teacher in the Huntington Beach Union High 
School District, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who 
convicted him of six felony counts after a non-jury trial last month. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyland, 43, of Dana Point, avoided currency reporting requirements to the IRS 
by keeping deposits and money exchanges to less than $10,000. A total of 
$105,000 went unreported from January, 1987, to August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This is extremely suspicious conduct," Rafeedie said. "The only reasonable 
conclusion to be drawn from this is that the defendant was laundering money. . 
. . It is difficult to escape the conclusion that these transactions were 
somehow related to drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie said federal agents have a tougher time fighting the drug war when 
"respectable" people such as Hoyland "surrender to the lure of easy money." 
</P>
<P>
"It sets a very bad example if a high school teacher becomes a cog in (the 
wheel of) narcotics trafficking," Rafeedie said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyland's attorney, Victor Sherman, argued during the trial that Hoyland 
believed his banking activities were legal and did not know that the law had 
been changed in January, 1987, to forbid such structuring of bank transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyland and John F. Ford, 42, a boat-builder from Long Beach, were arrested by 
state officials on separate money-laundering charges on Dec. 22, 1987, but the 
charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in that investigation had seized more than $1.1 million in cash, 50 
1-ounce gold coins worth about $23,000, a 52-foot racing yacht, a Porsche and a 
Maserati from Hoyland and Ford, alleging that they were derived from 
money-laundering proceeds, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
No mention of drugs was made in the federal indictment against Hoyland, but 
police said traces of cocaine were found on the yacht and on bills he deposited 
in banks. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyland taught science at Edison High School in Huntington Beach but is now on 
unpaid leave and has been told that he will be dismissed, said Susan Roper, 
personnel administrator for the Huntington Beach Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyland deposited about $65,267 into various Orange County branches of Security 
Pacific National Bank, Bank of Newport and Bank of America, always keeping his 
deposit amounts to less than $10,000. He also concealed the source of another 
$40,000 by exchanging $20 bills for $100 bills in 11 transactions at various 
county bank branches from Aug. 10, 1987, to Aug. 18, 1987.

2 GROUPS VIE FOR '90 AIR SHOW AT BROWN FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council, after being promised that a revamped Air/Space 
America will pay off its 1988 air show debt and turn a profit in 1990, on 
Monday set up a two-way competition for the right to stage an aerial 
extravaganza at Brown Field next year. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood's staff was told by council to compare Air/Space 
America's 1990 show plans with a proposal to be submitted by U.S. Air Show, a 
new group. A recommendation is due by April 24, when council will decide 
whether to hold another show, whether to contribute $300,000 in city funds and 
which group to back. 
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a lengthy presentation by an overhauled team from 
Air/Space America, which on Feb. 7 lost the right to hold the show. At that 
time, council, citing doubts about Air/Space America's financial acumen and the 
1988 show debt, abruptly canceled the show and withdrew $300,000 in funding 
from hotel tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damage to Brown Field 
</P>
<P>
The show also caused at least $65,000 in damage to Brown Field -- Councilman 
Bob Filner claimed Monday that the total is closer to $200,000 -- and resulted 
in some subcontractors suing the city to recoup losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Air/Space America promised Monday to pay off the debt before next year's 
May 4 show and to turn a profit of more than $900,000 from the 10-day event. 
Last year's show featured aerial acrobatics, trade booths, paratroop jumps and 
rides on the supersonic Concorde jet. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finish off this debt even before we hold the show," said Dick 
Shigley, the organization's new vice-president for finance and operations. 
</P>
<P>
The group also promised to keep the show in San Diego and end its adversary 
relationship with Lockwood's office, which had insisted on a performance bond 
for last year's show but was overruled by council. New executives and 
subcontractors have been added to the Air/Space group, and retired Rear Adm. 
Bill Walsh, whom some council members believe was the cause of last year's 
money problems, has been relieved of financial responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get along with the city," Shigley said. "That's the bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
About $1 million in up-front revenue is expected to come from show "boosters," 
who will be asked to put up $25 each. In addition, organizers hope to get at 
least $500,000 from large corporations, which will be asked to join six other 
large firms that paid $100,000 to become "founders" of the 1988 show. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America has also signed up the Lufkin Group, which its officials 
described as an international marketing firm capable of generating large 
revenues by lining up official sponsors for the show. President Paul Lufkin 
said that the organization's revenue estimates for the show are understated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Figures 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood acknowledged Monday that Air/Space America's 1988 debt is actually 
$2.7 million to $2.9 million, as the group has claimed since the debt 
controversy began two months ago. An audit conducted for the city had placed 
the debt at $4.2 million, but Lockwood told the council that Air/Space America 
will not be required to pay off the entire sum. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America, for example, said it does not intend to pay about $1 million 
to an unlicensed paving contractor who they maintain failed to adequately 
surface Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acknowledged that the show, which in its first try became the 
world's third largest, is an important source of revenue and publicity for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
But they expressed wariness about another debacle of unfulfilled promises, 
debts, traffic snafus, legal problems and damage to city-owned Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful thing for San Diego if you guys have your act together, 
and that's what we're asking you to convince us," Councilman Bruce Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Show group, organized by four men who oversaw major parts of the 
1988 Air/Space America show but have since split from the group, must quickly 
submit a plan to Lockwood's office to be considered for next year's show. 
</P>
<P>
The group appears to lack Air/Space America's political connections. It was 
Air/Space America founder and former Congressman Bob Wilson, along with former 
Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin, who appealed to Mayor Maureen O'Connor to 
schedule Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who is chief executive officer of the organization, led Monday's 
presentation and has been lobbying council members for support.

STATE FUNDS SOUGHT FOR OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER IN CHULA VISTA 
</P>

<P>
A star-studded cast of former Olympians turned out Monday as two state senators 
unveiled legislation seeking $15 million in state funds for a U.S. Olympic 
training center planned for Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Sens. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) and Wadie 
Deddeh (D-Bonita), would allocate the money to the state Commerce Department, 
which would then transfer the funds in three installments to the United States 
Olympic Training Center Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to augment up to $40 million that Deddeh said the 
foundation would raise from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be the third sports training center in the country, but the 
first to be available throughout the year. The two other centers are in Lake 
Placid, N.Y., and Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is to be a "state-of-the-art" center designed to accommodate the 
needs of athletes in 16 sports, including track and field, volleyball, 
swimming, soccer, bobsled and luge. 
</P>
<P>
It will be located on 154 acres west of the Lower Otay Reservoir on land 
donated by the Eastlake Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending a Capitol news conference to push for the bill were gold 
medalists Bill Toomey, Bob Seagren and Candy Burke, and silver medalists Terry 
Schroeder and Doug Burke. Also attending was Baaron Pittinger, executive 
director of the U.S. Olympic Committee, which has approved the center as an 
official Olympic training facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction of a world-class, state-of-the-art training center will give 
American athletes the chance to compete on an even footing with athletes from 
around the world," Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Gov. George Deukmejian, who has supported locating the center 
in San Diego County, said the governor has no position on the Campbell bill. He 
added that any attempt to spend more state money this year would "face an extra 
hurdle" because Deukmejian is faced with a tight budget that had already led 
him to propose cutting health and social service programs for the state's 
neediest residents.

CHURCH CONGREGATIONS PLAN MASS MEETING ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of church congregations that have battled local officials the last 2 
years over such matters as stoplights and park patrols will hold a mass meeting 
on countywide drug problems Thursday with the mayors of Anaheim and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 members of the Orange County Congregation-Community 
Organizations, an interfaith federation of 15 congregations, are expected to 
attend the 7:30 p.m. meeting at Servite High School in Anaheim, group spokesman 
Andy Saavedra said. 
</P>
<P>
The group will ask Mayors Daniel H. Young of Santa Ana and Fred Hunter of 
Anaheim to take back to their city councils resolutions declaring a "drug 
epidemic" in Orange County and calling for increased resources for law 
enforcement and treatment and prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are gaping holes in the war on drugs," said Saavedra, a member of St. 
Joseph's Catholic Church in Santa Ana. "We want to ask them (the mayors) why 
they're not making drugs the No. 1 priority and get them to admit that there's 
an epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
The congregations have been organized with the assistance of the Orange County 
Sponsoring Committee, an umbrella group of religious and lay community leaders 
that began organizing county neighborhoods in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 years ago, after a few dormant years, the committee regrouped and 
brought in professional organizers from the Pacific Institute for Community 
Organizing (PICO) in Oakland. The organizers work with individual 
congregations, developing local leadership and helping to identify community 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The newly organized church groups have used their muscle to win several battles 
over the last 2 years: 
</P>
<P>
* Parishioners at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim pressured city 
officials into improving lighting and increasing patrols at Pearson Park, a 
local haven for drug traffickers and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
* Members of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church persuaded Santa Ana City Manager 
David N. Ream to clean up a city-owned storage yard and reduce neighborhood 
truck traffic that residents felt was dangerous. The church group is now 
fighting the city over the location of a new park that it fears may bring drugs 
and other crime into the community. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting, however, will be the first time that the PICO-organized 
church groups have banded together and confronted public officials on such a 
multifaceted problem as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Saavedra said that in more than 4,000 interviews with parishioners from the 15 
congregations, church leaders found that concern about drugs was a unifying 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just a thread running through the interviews -- it was a rope," 
Saavedra said.

MORE MINORITY STUDENTS, FACULTY URGED AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason met Monday with student protesters who 
demanded increased recruitment of minority students and faculty at UCI, 
establishment of an African American studies department and increased funding 
for minority-student programs. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Peltason followed a noon news conference at which 
representatives of five student groups presented demands and circulated 
petitions seeking the resignation of UC President David Gardner because of what 
they called "his lack of response in addressing the needs of under-represented 
UC students." The students also planned a "teach-in" protest today at the Bren 
Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to start opening doors today," said Stephanie Lopez, a 
representative of the Associated Graduate Students of UCI, "or we're going to 
kick the doors down tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
In an hourlong session with 16 students Monday afternoon, Peltason said that 
recruiting minority faculty and students "is very high on my list of 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
"More than one-half of the offers being made to prospective faculty members 
(for the 1989-90 academic year) are being made to women and minority faculty," 
the chancellor said. "And almost 20% of the admissions for next year are for 
persons of under-represented minorities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Instructors Left 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, UCI had five black and 22 Latino faculty members with tenure among 
637 total tenured faculty. At least four black faculty members left the school 
in 1988, three because they were not promoted. Black and Latino undergraduates 
at UCI totaled 10.5% last fall, compared to an average 13.8% for all eight UC 
undergraduate campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters -- representing black, Latino, gay and lesbian, and graduate 
student groups -- met with Peltason, Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien 
and Vice Chancellor Horace Mitchell in the campus Cross Cultural Center, a 
$750,000 gathering place for minority students that was finished in March. 
</P>
<P>
However, no Asians -- who now make up more than a third of UCI's undergraduate 
students -- joined in the protest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recruiting and other minority-related demands, students called 
for appointment of a full-time paid director of the Gay and Lesbian Student 
Union, opening married student housing to gay couples, providing low-cost 
health insurance for graduate students and student employees, and allowing 
greater student control of facilities that are funded with student fees, such 
as the University Center. 
</P>
<P>
None of the complaints appeared to be resolved by the end of the 
sometimes-contentious session, in which administrators argued that more money 
is being funneled to minority organizations but that no campus group had gotten 
funding for everything on its wish list. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Soto of the gay and lesbian group called Peltason's statements 
"rhetoric. Changes are not being made," she said. 
</P>
<P>
University Ombudsman Ron Wilson said the protesters are representative of many 
UCI students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Concerned and Serious' 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with students who are frustrated, angry and who are concerned 
and serious about their concerns," Wilson said, adding: "We have not adequately 
dealt with the needs of gay and lesbian students here. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now trying to aggressively pursue minority faculty and staff, but we 
haven't in the past. And we've attracted (minority) students; we just have not 
been successful in retaining them."

A MAJOR MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 300,000 people marched in Washington Sunday to leave a message for the 
U. S. Supreme Court. It said that millions of Americans think the law must 
continue to give women the freedom to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the court reads such messages is a matter of debate among legal 
scholars, but the crowd of women and men, mothers and daughters, celebrities 
and ordinary believers in the cause could not have made a more coherent 
statement, one with which we absolutely agree: Government has no right to pry 
into a decision as deeply personal, private and agonizing as the one that every 
year leads 1.6 million women to have abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The march, the largest ever seen in the capital, was timed to catch the court's 
attention as it nears the April 26 date for argument in a Missouri abortion 
case. The court is being asked by anti-abortion forces to use the Missouri case 
as a vehicle to reverse the 1973 decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade that made 
abortion legal under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the march hoped to impress the court -- or at least one or two 
justices who conceivably could go for a reversal -- that most Americans don't 
want that to happen. At a minimum, they do not want the country to return to 
the hazards of illicit and furtive operations that often were involved before 
Roe vs. Wade. The march also was intended as a reminder that abortion is a 
powerful symbol of the rights of women, even the many who oppose abortion, 
because it involves decisions they are determined to make for themselves about 
their health and the life they will lead. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Roe vs. Wade claim that the Constitution contains no guarantees of 
such rights. But the court must look beyond legal principle to tenable social 
policy and good sense, and both dictate that the right of a woman to choose to 
terminate a pregnancy meets both of those tests.

RUNAWAY POPULATION GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California grew in population by the size of Delaware in the year ending last 
July 1. Since the 1980 census, the Golden State has added the equivalent 
population of a Maryland, a Louisiana, a Minnesota or a Washington State. Just 
two decades ago, California was running neck and neck with New York to be the 
nation's most populous state. Today, California has 10 million more residents 
than No. 2 New York. 
</P>
<P>
The state's growth is impressive. It is phenomenal. It is challenging. 
</P>
<P>
California's population is estimated by the state Department of Finance to be 
28.3 million, a record increase of 662,000 over the previous year and up 4.6 
million from the official federal census in 1980. Today, one of every nine 
Americans lives in California. If the state were to keep growing at the current 
rate of 2.5% a year, its population would surpass 30 million by 1992 and be 
nudging 40 million by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
California has about 10 million more residents than Australia and New Zealand 
combined. The state passed Canada in population several years ago, as well as 
all of Scandinavia, including Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is growing faster than the state as a whole. Of the five 
largest counties, only Santa Clara (San Jose) is in Northern California. 
Riverside and San Bernardino are growing at the fastest rate of the state's 
larger counties. San Bernardino replaced Alameda (Oakland) as California's 
fifth most-populous county while Riverside surpassed Sacramento for seventh 
place. 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that coping with growth in a rational, systematic way is 
California's major challenge. It is a challenge that will not go away.

Regarding Eugene Carroll's column on Cheney's approach to dealing with 
individual service chiefs (Op-Ed Page, March 29), I just want to express my 
disagreement with the ex-rear admiral and applaud Cheney. Certainly, some new 
approaches must be explored to jolt the services out of their parochial 
attitudes, including having the commander-in-chief encourage early retirement 
for those military men who won't follow orders and accept some fiscal 
responsibilities. Carroll would have Cheney clasp hands with just the folks who 
cause the problem. 
</P>
<P>
This fine example of the military mentality wants to blame the defense industry 
for poor procurement decisions by the Pentagon. That's analogous to my blaming 
the department stores for permitting my wife and I to overextend our credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
I have a real concern for what might be coming out of the Center for Defense 
Information with a deputy director who's looking for someone else to blame.

INSURER CAN EXCLUDE NON-DISASTER DAMAGES TO HOME, COURT RULES

An insurance company can deny coverage for damage caused by a landslide or 
other disaster not part of a customer's policy, even when another cause 
contributes to the damage, a federal appeals court ruled Monday in the case of 
a La Palma couple. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, if followed by California 
courts, would expand a victory for insurers on a related issue in a ruling by 
the state Supreme Court on March 30. A federal court interpreting state law 
cannot bind state courts, but its rulings can be influential. 
</P>
<P>
The federal court upheld a lower-court decision that denied insurance benefits 
to Steven and Peggy Martin, who noticed the foundation cracking and bulging in 
their newly bought La Palma home in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Martins' claim was denied by State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., which said 
the damage was caused, at least in part, by earth movement, which was 
specifically excluded from coverage in their homeowners policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Martins said the earth movement was attributable to sulfates in the soil, 
allegedly a condition covered by their policy. Contributing to the damage, they 
said, was faulty construction of the house, which would be covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm cited a clause in the insurance policy that denied coverage for 
damage that would not have occurred without earth movement or earthquakes, even 
if other causes contributed to the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Similar clauses were adopted by most California insurers about 1983 after a 
Marin County jury awarded $1.047 million in damages to a couple who were denied 
coverage after their home started to split apart. The insurer in that case 
blamed earth movement, which was excluded by the policy; the couple blamed 
faulty construction, which was covered. 
</P>
<P>
The damage award was based on a previous California court ruling allowing 
benefits if a cause covered by insurance had contributed substantially to the 
damages. But the California Supreme Court on March 30 overturned the damages 
and ordered a retrial based on a new rule: the risk covered by insurance must 
be the primary or predominant cause of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's case, however, the question was whether insurers could put an even 
more restrictive rule in their policies: denying coverage if the damage would 
not have occurred without earth movement, regardless of what caused the 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Martins, contesting the exclusion, relied on a California law that says an 
insurer must pay benefits when a risk covered by the policy was the "proximate" 
cause of the damage, a term that has been interpreted to mean either the 
primary cause or a substantial cause. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court said the law applies only when an insurance policy is 
silent on the issue and does not prevent an insurer from putting more severe 
restrictions in the policy. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 decision endorsed the view of the trial judge, U.S. District Judge 
Consuelo Marshall of Los Angeles, who said: "An insurance company has the right 
to limit the coverage of a policy issued by it, and when it has done so, the 
plain language of the limitation must be respected." 
</P>
<P>
The unsigned ruling was issued by Judges J. Clifford Wallace, William Canby and 
Stephen Trott. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Witmer, the Martins' lawyer, said he was disappointed by the ruling. He 
contended that the state law "embodies public policy," which cannot be violated 
by an insurance contract. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Abrahams, a lawyer for State Farm, said the company "wrote the new policy 
language to avoid all these complicated discussions" about multiple causes of 
damage.

GOVERNOR'S LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conservative George Will's moving description of the squalor and violence of 
Chicago's Cabrini Green public-housing project was the more significant for his 
recognition that poverty and hopelessness are the major culprits that thwart 
well-meant social programs. His refusal to "blame the victims" (or government) 
here is a repudiation of the laissez-faire style of government he himself has 
so often advocated ("The Rebarbarization of America," Op-Ed Page March 30). 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, on the same day, Gov. George Deukmejian (letter) fairly spat out 
his own repudiation of The Times' excellent analysis of California's problems 
(which include a sizable homeless population). By implying that no present or 
future social problems can be serious enough to warrant government "spending 
increases," Deukmejian shows that he is one-dimensional on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor should not be blamed for being who he is. Rather, we should 
ask ourselves whether we really intended his mean-spirited and callous brand of 
conservatism when we elected him (or when we enacted Prop. 13, for that 
matter). 
</P>
<P>
Will's "rebarbarization of America" continues apace, and we have yet to show 
the wisdom needed for laying the groundwork for a healthy social and political 
climate for our posterity. Not much to be proud of, so far.

ADVICE FOR DICK CHENEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Col. Harry Summers, who is often capable of unusually incisive analysis of the 
problems of waging war, could have been more helpful in his advice to Secretary 
of Defense Dick Cheney ("Cheney's Job: Visualize the Wars and Roles We're 
Equipping For," Op-Ed Page, March 31). 
</P>
<P>
Cheney may well turn out to be a superb bean-counter and paper-shuffler, in the 
best tradition of Robert McNamara, but it is doubtful he is capable of 
visualizing war. One pretty much has to have been in one to have any real 
understanding of what it takes just to stay in the field, much less win. Cheney 
lacks that experience. So, the best advice one could give Cheney is: Seek out 
the few warriors who still survive among the gaggle of commissioned bureaucrats 
who "lead" the uniformed services these days; solicit their advice, learn from 
their experience and their reflections on that experience. Then use that 
learning to effect reforms in strategy, forces and doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
If, when Cheney leaves office, the U.S. can deploy military forces capable of 
successfully waging warfare against real enemies (the Grenadian Home Guard 
doesn't count) in a variety of operational and political settings, without 
either having to go nuclear or cut-and-run to save their backside, he will have 
earned his pay, and maybe a place in history to boot.

DEFENSE ASKS DISMISSAL OF CHARGES IN GANGLAND-STYLE MURDER ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attempted murder charges against reputed mob captain Michael Anthony Rizzitello 
and associate Joseph Angelo Grosso should be dismissed because the prosecution 
withheld "substantial" evidence "favorable" to the defendants, their lawyers 
argued Monday in court. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans, who is prosecuting 
Rizzitello and Grosso for the 1987 gangland-style shooting of William C. 
Carroll, scoffed at the accusation, made by Rizzitello attorney Anthony P. 
Brooklier and Grosso attorney Michael T. Kenney. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was going to hide it, why wouldn't I hide it for good instead of turning 
it over 2 weeks before trial?" Evans said. "The second I received this evidence 
I dispatched it to Mr. Brooklier." 
</P>
<P>
At issue are two tape recordings of conversations on May 1, 1987, by Costa Mesa 
police detectives who interviewed Carroll in a hospital emergency room just 
hours after he was shot, execution-style, three times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapes Mailed March 31 
</P>
<P>
Evans mailed the tapes to the defense on March 31 when, he said, he learned 
they existed. Evans told the court that Costa Mesa police, who investigated the 
shooting, had said in both their reports and conversations that Carroll refused 
to cooperate or divulge who shot him but that police never mentioned 
audiocassettes. Evans said he discovered the tapes while going through all 
Costa Mesa's physical evidence in preparation for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys claimed that Evans "kept from the defense" what they called 
"key evidence," contending that the tapes conflict with Carroll's sworn 
testimony at two preliminary hearings last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The trial had been scheduled to begin Monday but was delayed to May 8 to allow 
the defense motion to be heard by Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, part owner of the notorious Mustang topless bar in Santa Ana that was 
torched and destroyed 15 months ago, was shot three times at close range inside 
his car and left in a parking garage near the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. He survived but is permanently blinded. He refused to discuss the 
attack for 17 months but did so for the first time on the day after several 
criminal charges against him in another case were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello, 61, of Los Angeles, and Grosso, 45, of Newport Beach, are facing 
first-degree attempted murder and other, related charges stemming from the 
April 30, 1987, shooting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle Over Illicit Profits 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case hinges largely upon Carroll's testimony. At preliminary 
hearings last fall for Rizzitello and Grosso, Carroll testified that the trio 
dined together at a Santa Ana restaurant and then drove together to the South 
Coast Plaza-area garage. He testified that Grosso held down his legs while 
Rizzitello pumped three bullets into his head, ending a battle over who would 
control illicit profits from the Mustang bar.

UPGRADE TALKS WITH THE PLO; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL NEEDS THE SIGNAL, ARAFAT NEEDS THE CONFIDENCE TO DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES H. PERCY, Charles H. Percy, former U.S. senator from Illinois 
(1967-1984), was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 
1980-84. He currently is chairman of the United States International Cultural 
and Trade Center Presidential Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's visit to Washington, the 
Israeli government's self-defeating political stalemate on the Palestinian 
question has been reaffirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the intifada's clarion call for political change, Shamir's peace plan 
-- local elections without international supervision -- gives no real hope to 
the Palestinians since their acknowledged representative, the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, cannot take part. Fearless of a deeply divided Labor 
Party in Israel and confident that the U.S. Congress would not force him to 
account for human rights violations, Shamir declared himself "immune" from Bush 
Administration pressure even before arriving in Washington. Clearly, Israel's 
lockout of the PLO in the conflict-resolution process calls for new American 
initiatives and leadership in reconciling the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
As Shamir certainly knows, disputes between two groups are never resolved when 
one side insists on dictating the composition of the other's negotiating team. 
In this case, Shamir is misguided if he expects Israel to avoid dealing 
directly or indirectly with the PLO. By now, it is clear that only the PLO can 
claim to be the legitimate political representative of the Palestinian people. 
Just as important, only the PLO can deliver anything after negotiations that 
would bind Palestinians to future rules of conduct, an essential precept for a 
lasting peace. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has largely accepted this reality. In recent 
congressional testimony, Secretary of State James A. Baker III declared that 
Israel could not rule out negotiations with the PLO, thereby breaking an 
unspoken taboo against U.S. policy-makers publicly discussing such an option. 
In addition, the Adminis- tration has recently emphasized the necessity of 
concessions by both the PLO and Israel, steps that would bring confidence and 
logically culminate in discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that each side's ability to make concessions is in reverse 
proportion to their willingness to do so. As the occupying power on the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel has available numerous concessions but has 
heretofore made only cosmetic gestures. At all costs, Shamir wants to stonewall 
any Israeli actions that might lead to either direct contact with the PLO or 
spark Palestinian hope for an independent state. The PLO, starting from a basic 
position of weakness, has already recognized Israel's right to exist and 
renounced terrorism. It has little left to concede other than the intifada 
itself, which it would gladly do if statehood could be guaranteed at the end of 
the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
There are two compelling reasons for the United States and Israel to be more 
forthcoming and realistic vis-a-vis the PLO. First, the current, relatively 
moderate PLO leadership continues to be threatened by secular and radical 
religious elements. It must achieve tangible results if it is to maintain 
credibility with the Palestinian people. Second, the incipient proliferation of 
medium-range conventional missiles in the Middle East, not to mention 
biological and nuclear weapons capabilities, raise the specter of what British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has called "the horrors of further conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Most experts now see a permanent shift occurring in the Arab-Israeli military 
equation. Within the three- to five-year time frame most often mentioned as a 
transitional period to some form of Palestinian self-rule, at least five Arab 
countries will likely possess arms capable of inflicting massive damage on 
Israel. Libya may have significantly shortened this period with its recent 
purchase of advanced jet bombers from the Soviet Union. A genuine peace process 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors, especially the Palestinians, must begin 
very soon. 
</P>
<P>
No political group in Israel today appears strong enough to move from 
factionalism to unity and achieve peace. Creative U.S. diplomacy is essential 
to a process of concessions and counter-concessions that must break the current 
Israeli-PLO deadlock. To jump-start this process, the most promising immediate 
U.S. option is to rapidly normalize communications between Washington and the 
PLO. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the very experienced U.S. ambassador, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., is 
the only approved channel of communication with the PLO. This arrangement may 
prove too inflexible, considering the difficult road ahead for U.S. diplomacy. 
A concerted move by the United States to upgrade talks with the PLO could give 
Arafat the confidence to consider further, difficult concessions -- including 
those involving the intifada itself -- and hopefully provide the impetus for a 
more constructive Israeli position. 
</P>
<P>
This evolution in the American position may seem premature to some, but the 
U.S. dialogue with the PLO is now our most powerful vehicle for peace. It may 
well be that only through an intensified U.S.-PLO dialogue will Israel and its 
leaders finally realize that Israeli peace and security, which the U.S. 
considers essential, hinge on their own direct dialogue with the PLO.

Firefighters from the San Diego Fire Department and the California Division of 
Forestry contained a slow-moving brush fire in the Otay Mesa area Monday 
afternoon and expected to have it extinguished by this morning, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out just after 10 a.m., burned about 138 acres of brush, 
said CDF spokeswoman Audrey Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was a mile east of Alta Road near the Otay Mountain Truck Trail.

Hand crews from the CDF were summoned to aid San Diego firefighters, said San 
Fire Department spokesman Larry Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured and no homes were damaged in the fire, the cause of which

85% IN CSUN POLL OPPOSE OFF-CAMPUS GRADUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of graduating students polled last week at Cal State 
Northridge oppose plans for this year's graduation at the Hollywood Bowl, 
organizers of the student-run survey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the 922 students who responded to the survey also said they want 
to take from four to nine guests, instead of the three guests tentatively 
allowed by the university, said poll organizer Anthony Ashhurst, an Associated 
Students graduate senator. 
</P>
<P>
The university decided to hold the graduation in the bowl because the campus 
area normally used for the ceremony has been closed for construction. 
Administrators said they had to limit the number of guests to prevent 
overcrowding at the bowl, which holds 17,960 people and has parking for 3,500 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
In past ceremonies, about 65% of the eligible graduates have attended 
ceremonies, administrators said. About 4,650 degrees will be awarded at the May 
26 graduation, university spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which consisted of six questions about students' graduation 
preferences, was conducted Wednesday and Thursday by a committee of students 
opposed to the university's graduation plans. The group was formed March 29 
after a campus protest against the plans, which were announced Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other survey findings include: 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine percent of the students polled said they favor having two campus 
ceremonies -- one in the morning and one in the afternoon -- as a way to 
overcome the shortage of space on campus. Other votes were split evenly between 
having three ceremonies at the same time in different campus locations and 
holding a series of ceremonies over several days. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one percent said they would buy tickets to help pay for campus 
ceremonies, with a majority of those students favoring ticket prices between $1 
and $4. 
</P>
<P>
Ashhurst said those who responded to the student-run survey at two campus 
polling stations represent more than 15% of the 5,942 students eligible to 
graduate this spring. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that only graduating students voted, names of voters were matched 
against a list of students eligible to graduate, vote organizer Beth Lawrence 
said. Votes were taken at two centrally located campus polling stations, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just really wanted to see how seniors felt about it and to show the 
administration" what students thought of the graduation plans, Lawrence said. 
"As far as we know, we were right. They don't want it at the Hollywood Bowl, 
and they want to bring more family members and friends, and they want 
individual recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven percent of the voters said it was important to them to receive 
individual recognition, which in the past has been in the form of a handshake 
from CSUN President James W. Cleary. This year, however, individual recognition 
may not be possible because the bowl's design prevents graduates from marching 
on stage to receive diplomas and shake Cleary's hand, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Unchanged 
</P>
<P>
Dean of Students Edmund T. Peckham, who met with several of the vote organizers 
Monday, said the survey will not change this year's graduation plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The survey is a very helpful document, and I particularly appreciated the 
concern and care that some of our graduates have for our program, but the 
arrangements for the bowl have been made . . .," Peckham said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the survey will help administrators plan next year's graduation. 
</P>
<P>
The university on Monday sent out a survey of its own to all graduating 
students, Peckham said. Results of the survey will help determine how many 
students plan to attend the ceremony and how many guests students want to take. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaires are to be returned by April 21. It also asks whether 
students and their families plan to drive to the bowl or take buses provided by 
the university, Peckham said. 
</P>
<P>
If some students request fewer than three guest tickets, others could obtain 
more than three, Peckham said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man, in his 20s, died of multiple stab wounds he suffered 
during a scuffle near the international border Sunday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents witnessed the fight among five men in the Tijuana 
River levee about a quarter of a mile west of the San Ysidro port of entry, 
said Lt. Phil Jarvis of the San Diego Police Department's homicide detail. 
</P>
<P>
When the agents approached the five men, four fled across the border into 
Mexico, leaving the mortally wounded man, who died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis said Monday that there was no motive yet in the slaying. He said it was 
not known if the knifing erupted over an argument that spilled over to the U.S. 
side of the border or if it stemmed from a holdup by border bandits. 
</P>
<P>
The victim is described as being 5-foot-11 and 136 pounds, with a scraggly 
beard and mustache, said Dan Matticks, deputy coroner.

BRAUDE, UPSET OVER MIX-UPS, SEEKS REVIEW OF CONDO PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Embarrassed for the third time by construction permit mix-ups at a Woodland 
Hills condominium site, a Los Angeles city councilman has called for an 
internal investigation into the problem -- and for a new public hearing into 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude has asked city planning officials to scrutinize zoning 
laws that apply to the West Hills Condominiums so they can decide once and for 
all whether the project is too tall, too wide or deficient in parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living in a 30-year-old neighborhood beneath the hilltop project, who 
are angry about their view of the partially built, 80-unit complex, have 
charged that the project is all three. 
</P>
<P>
But each time city building officials answered one of the homeowners' 
accusations, they stumbled across previously overlooked zoning requirements 
that raised new questions in the residents' minds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Investigation 
</P>
<P>
An exasperated Braude revealed Monday that he has requested that city Chief 
Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard review the case "to interpret a 
number of issues which have arisen" with construction of the $7.5-million third 
and final phase of the townhouse project. 
</P>
<P>
Braude also called for a new public hearing on the case -- which officials 
thought was settled during a series of City Hall hearings that concluded in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
Delighted homeowners quickly praised Braude's action. But the project's 
developers said an investigation and hearing are not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"This might put us in the driver's seat," said Sid Perry, a Kelvin Avenue 
resident who has helped lead opposition to the development. "It seems amazing 
to us that there have been all these 'mistakes' found with this project. It's 
odd that all these 'mistakes' seem to favor the developer." 
</P>
<P>
Development partner James R. Gary reiterated his contention that the townhouse 
project is fully legal. He also disputed the need for a new hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"What would the purpose be? It's already built," Gary said. "This is nonsense. 
The building was approved by the city. At some point you've got to say the 
zoning is right, the height is right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion Began in 1988 
</P>
<P>
The first 10 years of the Ventura Boulevard condominium construction project 
were uneventful. The confusion began last year, when homeowners asked Braude 
about the third and final phase. 
</P>
<P>
In May, city building officials notified Braude that the entire project was 
completed, fully occupied and heavily landscaped. "All 80 units have been 
constructed," wrote a Building and Safety Department manager, adding that the 
occupancy permit for the final 24-unit phase had been issued Feb. 10, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, construction of the final phase did not begin until last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when homeowners complained that the new units were being built 
closer to their homes than the 1978 building permit allowed, a check by 
inspectors discovered that parts of the structure exceeded their 45-foot height 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, inspectors discovered that a 1983 Ventura Boulevard height limit 
ordinance actually allows buildings up to 75 feet tall at the site. The 
ordinance -- aimed at commercial buildings, not condominiums -- also requires 
that one parking space be set aside for every 300 feet of enclosed space. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that means the new building is required to have about 200 parking 
spaces instead of the about 65 planned. The deficiency may cause officials to 
require that a portion of the building be torn down, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Gary said he is convinced the building meets all conditions of the 1983 
ordinance. Last month, he escorted homeowner representative Paula Corby on a 
tour of the project in an effort to prove that the condominiums will be a good 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep trying to apply these different tests to us, hoping we'll eventually 
fail one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming confusion is getting ridiculous, said Cindy Miscikowski, chief 
aide to Braude. 
</P>
<P>
"This case has gotten more and more bizarre," she said Monday. "I hope there 
will be nothing else to be uncovered."

STATE TO REVIEW PERMIT FOR LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The permit for the Lopez Canyon Landfill will be reviewed this spring as part 
of an update of dump permits around the state, a California Waste Management 
Board official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Iwahiro, chief deputy detective officer for the board, said the review 
has nothing to do with recent problems at the dump. Last month, two workers 
were hospitalized when fumes escaped and the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District cited the dump for odors and an illegal excavation. 
</P>
<P>
But Iwahiro said the review will provide an opportunity for the state to 
scrutinize any operation problems that may have led to those violations. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is something that does not comport with the permit, then they've got 
to stop doing that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If any major changes need to be made in the permit, an environmental impact 
report and a series of public hearings will be required. 
</P>
<P>
However, Iwahiro said that probably would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Criticized 
</P>
<P>
At a morning news conference, Citizens United for Safe Trash Management accused 
the state of preparing to allow the city to write its own "permit wish list," 
then accepting the list without public input. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way to deal with a serious mismanagement problem. . . . It's a 
crazy way to go about it," said Rob Zapple, member of the Kagel Canyon Civic 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
By law, permit reviews are supposed to take place every five years, but Iwahiro 
said an analysis completed a year ago by the Waste Management Board showed that 
many dumps, including Lopez Canyon, had not been thoroughly reviewed for up to 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
One major difference between the existing permit and actual landfill operations 
is the volume of trash being dumped. The permit calls for about 8,000 tons per 
month, while the city Bureau of Sanitation says it dumps about 4,000 tons per 
day there. 
</P>
<P>
Iwahiro said the board believes the original total may have been a misprint 
that should be revised. 
</P>
<P>
"We all agree that that is an error . . . no way can we come up with that being 
correct," he said.

NEIGHBORS ASSAIL SCOPE OF PORTER RANCH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 250 people attended a public meeting Monday night where a residential and 
commercial development proposal in the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth was 
assailed as too large. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of PRIDE, a group of Porter Ranch-area residents opposed to the 
proposed development, organized the meeting at Chatsworth High School. They 
called on Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson to limit the size of the 
project's commercial area, which would include a shopping mall the size of the 
Northridge Fashion Center and office buildings of up to 15 stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch Development Co., run by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, 
wants to build 2,195 single-family homes, 800 condominiums and 7.5 million 
square feet of commercial space on 1,300 vacant acres north of the Simi Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Bernson does not listen, he is ignoring the will of the people, and in 
a democracy, that's a very dangerous thing to do," Robert Birch, 41, of 
Northridge, a spokesman for PRIDE, told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is the product of months of negotiations among the developer, city 
planners and a citizens advisory committee appointed by Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, city planners called for holding the project's commercial area to 
1.5 million square feet until the state funds an extra lane on the Simi Valley 
Freeway and for replacing 672,500 square feet of office space with 400 units of 
multifamily housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Set 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission has scheduled a public hearing on the development 
Thursday at the Van Nuys Woman's Club. 
</P>
<P>
"By far the biggest issue is the commercial development," said Paul Chipello, 
46, of Northridge, executive director of PRIDE. 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE member David Peltz, 50, of Chatsworth, used an overhead projector to show 
a multicolored pie graph under the headline, "Where the quality of life in 
Chatsworth is heading." The pie was divided into three sections: "Out the door, 
up in smoke and down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden made the meeting one of his campaign stops on the 
eve of today's mayoral election. After attacking Mayor Tom Bradley, Holden said 
he will ask Bernson, regarding Porter Ranch, to "work it out with these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"That many people against the project, are you kidding?" Holden said. "I've 
never seen anything like that in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who represents the area, has said he will not take a formal position 
on the matter until Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The name PRIDE began as an acronym for Porter Ranch Is Developed Enough, but 
Chipello said those words are too anti-development and have been abandoned, 
although the name remains. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development has maintained that the project would bring together 
jobs and housing and would pay for needed traffic improvements that could not 
be funded otherwise.

TEAMMATE SAYS GRETZKY WAS FLU VICTIM, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
KING STAR WAS SLOWED IN FIRST GAME OF NHL PLAYOFFS BUT IS ALL RIGHT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The flu bug that took several King players out of the lineup last week seems to 
be gone -- as might be the team's chances of advancing in the National Hockey 
League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, even John Tonelli was back at practice Monday for the first time in 
more than a week. But, Tonelli and goalie Kelly Hrudey were not the most 
celebrated players to have influenza. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows it, but Wayne (Gretzky) had the flu in the first game," teammate 
Marty McSorley said Monday afternoon on the eve of tonight's fifth game in the 
Forum in the best-of-seven series against the Edmonton Oilers. "Did you notice 
that he was the first one off the ice on every shift? He never does that." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky also chose not to go to the interview room that night and when he did 
talk with reporters in the locker room, he was looking tired and was sweating 
profusely. Reporters thought that the loss, the 100-degree weather and the 
crowd in the locker room explained his condition. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky also played only six minutes in the third period. At the time, it 
seemed to be just another reason for some to criticize the coaching of the 
Kings' Robbie Ftorek. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie isn't going to use excuses," McSorley said without alibiing for the 
Kings' 3-1 deficit in this series. "He isn't going to say that." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ftorek's policy is to say as little as he possibly can about injuries and 
illnesses. Gretzky was playing so he had no obligation to release information 
on Gretzky's health. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley mentioned it Monday because he was asked directly and because, he 
said: "That's all behind us now. Wayne played a hell of a game last (Sunday) 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he, himself, had had the flu, McSorley said: "The only thing wrong 
with me is I haven't been scoring." 
</P>
<P>
McSorley doesn't always show up at optional practices, but he was among several 
who surprised Ftorek by being there. The only players who were required to be 
on the ice today were the three who had not played the night before. And 
Tonelli had told Ftorek that he wanted to be there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, half the team showed up anyway. Gretzky rarely shows up at optional 
workouts and didn't break form Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley uses the 1987 Stanley Cup final series as a case in point. McSorley 
was playing for the Oilers when they went up, 3-1, on Philadelphia with two of 
the remaining games scheduled for Edmonton. Philadelphia managed to take that 
series to seven games before losing. 
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is a bunch of determined hockey players. . . . I've seen it 
slowly slip away from a team and I've seen teams come back," McSorley said. 
"Ask Doug Crossman, he was on that Philadelphia team." 
</P>
<P>
Crossman, another player who chose to skate Monday, agreed: "It can be done. . 
. . We have enough experience and enough composure to do it. We're not going to 
roll over." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings need to play a little longer, at least, if they want to give Tonelli 
a chance to at least compete for a fifth Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to hurt him to be out now," McSorley said. "The guy is dying to play. 
He lives to play. That's why guys feed off of him. When he was in the hospital 
we sure missed him. You can almost feel his presence with this team." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will have Tonelli's presence back at the Forum tonight, but whether 
he plays is another question that won't be answered until game time. 
</P>
<P>
As Ftorek points out, at playoff time, with only 20 players dressing, everyone 
has to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli developed complications with his flu and has been in much worse shape 
than the others who have come back in a day or two. Tonelli doesn't want to 
admit that he had pneumonia. Just as he doesn't want to say how much weight he 
lost or how high his temperature got. But it is with a serious tone that he 
says, "I was sick." 
</P>
<P>
Kings Notes 
</P>
<P>
The fifth game of the Kings' best-of-seven Smythe Division semifinal playoff 
series against the Oilers will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will be televised by 
Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570). . . . Asked if he was feeling any 
pressure to win this series to save his job, King Coach Robbie Ftorek said: 
"That's something I wouldn't waste time thinking about. The only thing I'm 
concerned with is winning the next game. I care about the team. As for me 
individually, I don't give a hoot." 
</P>
<P>
Marty McSorley, pointing out that the Kings' 91 points for second place in the 
Smythe Division and the Oilers' 84 points for third added up to (175) more than 
the total for any other second-and-third place matchups, said: "It's unusual to 
have a first round matching teams of this caliber." 
</P>
<P>
In assessing the Oilers' position after taking the 3-1 lead with Sunday's 
victory at Edmonton, former King Jimmy Carson said: "We held serve. But by no 
means are we going to get cocky at match point." . . . Carson acknowledged that 
there is a certain confidence that comes with being the defending champions. 
It's a feeling that was not there in his time with the Kings. "There is a sort 
of a wave of emotion that is starting to build," Carson said. "They've won four 
Cups in five years. You just ride with it."

JIM MURRAY: OLD-TIMER STRIKES BACK AT COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1930, something like 57 National League batters batted over .300. One of 
them batted .401. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, only four National League batters hit over .300. The league champion 
hit .313. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, every member of the champion St. Louis Cardinals starting lineup 
batted over .300. Last year, most teams didn't have any batters over .300. 
</P>
<P>
The late Fresco Thompson used to recall ruefully the year he hit .324 for the 
Philadelphia Phillies -- and batted eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, the year Bill Terry batted .401, the second-place hitter, Babe Herman, 
batted .393. The third-place hitter, Chuck Klein, batted .386, fourth was Lefty 
O'Doul at .383 and fifth was Fred Lindstrom at .379. Terry got 254 hits, Klein, 
250 and Herman, 241. 
</P>
<P>
The most hits in the National League last year was Andre Galarraga's 184. 
</P>
<P>
Hack Wilson drove in 190 runs for the Chicago Cubs in 1930. The league leader 
last year was Will Clark of San Francisco with 109. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Were there giants in those days, runts in this? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball scholars have been uneasy with these figures, this discrepancy, for 
years. It is not possible for them to conclude that the batters of a 
half-century ago were that much better than those of today. There must be an 
illogical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Their "explanation" makes Bill Starr see red. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Starr is not a nostalgia buff. Bill Starr is not one of those 
Ty-Cobb-was-better-than-Pete-Rose guys. Bill Starr was an owner of the San 
Diego Padres in the '40s and '50s before the major leagues came to California. 
He was a player in the '30s, briefly a catcher for the old Washington Senators 
(now the Minnesota Twins). 
</P>
<P>
Starr's outrage is not directed at those who would say that today's players are 
as good as yesterday's. He concedes that. What brings him off the wall is the 
notion promoted by those who would hold that yesterday's players were no good 
-- and that they can prove it with computers. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the pitchers couldn't get them out. But the computers blow them 
away. Starr has written a book titled "Clearing The Bases -- Baseball Then And 
Now," and he points to the following paragraph taken from another book ("The 
Hidden Game Of Baseball") as an example of rewriting history by floppy disk. 
"If Ty Cobb's career had taken place . . . in 1976," those authors have 
written, "his lifetime B.A. (which was actually .367) would have been only 
.289. Rogers Hornsby (lifetime .358) and Joe DiMaggio (lifetime .325) would 
have achieved identical .280 marks. Bill Terry, Lou Gehrig and Tris Speaker 
would be average to mediocre hitters at .271, .269 and .265, respectively. The 
Babe's (Ruth's) .262 (Babe actually hit .342) would be a disappointment, though 
better than Al Simmons' .260 (Al hit .334 with the bat but not the bytes) or 
Honus Wagner's .251 (Honus had better luck in person, too, .329)." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that 1930 was a bumper year for base hits (the National League 
batted .303 for that year while last year's average was .248), Starr blames the 
decline in hitting on a number of observable (not computerized) phenomenas, 
most notably the strikeout. It's become endemic in the big leagues. Big 
leaguers struck out 25,098 times in 1987, compared to a two-league average of 
only 7,517 in the '20s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern ballplayer seems to have no knowledge of the strike zone," Starr 
laments. "Babe Ruth had a big reputation as a striker-outer, but he struck out 
only 79 times a year on the average. DiMaggio struck out only 27, Ted Williams 
only 46. Gehrig struck out only 49, even homer sluggers such as Mel Ott struck 
out only 48 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson averaged 129 a year and put the strikeout record 600 above 
everyone else. He struck out 171 times one year. Wilver Stargell struck out 122 
times a year. Mickey Mantle struck out an average of 105 times a year, and Mike 
Schmidt strikes out 117. Babe Ruth isn't even in the top 25 in lifetime 
strikeouts anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Starr disputes the notion a strikeout is "a nice clean out." It doesn't result 
in a double play or worse, it's not as humiliating as a popup. But, says Starr, 
"It kills a rally. It raises the morale of the pitcher. Nothing is more 
counter-productive to the winning of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Starr points out that "in 1987, there were 41 players who struck out more than 
100 times. By comparison, in the entire 20 years from 1920 through 1939, 100 or 
more strikeouts occurred only 10 times." He points out that Cobb only struck 
out 24 times the year he hit .401 and that George Sisler struck out only 14 
times the year he hit .420. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth never struck out 100 times. Reggie Jackson had 100 or more strikeouts 
18 times in his career. "That's why he only batted .263," Starr explains. 
Mantle fanned more than 100 times eight seasons and more than 90 in four 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Starr takes issue with the notion a lively ball produced the orgy of base hits 
in 1930. Starr argues that the goal of baseball was never to "juice up" a 
baseball, only to make it more uniform. He says, on the contrary, that after 
1930, the National League changed the cork center of the ball and raised the 
seams, which resulted in a dramatic drop in that league's offense (Hack Wilson 
went from 56 homers to 13 and from 190 RBIs to 61 but bathtub gin may have had 
as much to do with it as baseballs). And it turned the National League into a 
curveball league that really wasn't competitive with the power-hitting American 
League for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Starr thinks, in addition to not knowing the strike zone, players are not 
seasoned in the minor leagues the way they used to be -- and should be. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Bill Starr takes on the computer rewriters of history on a 
You-had-to-be-there basis. He points out, for example, that Pythagorean 
principles don't apply to psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Robinson was a comparable example. His batting statistics were not 
overwhelming, and he hardly rated among the most outstanding defensive players 
in baseball history. But he, like Cobb, was an intimidator on the basepaths. He 
put pressure on the opposition, he compelled defensive changes in their play. 
Infielders were made to move closer to their bags, thus producing larger holes 
in the infield. To prevent Robinson from stealing, pitchers were compelled to 
alter their natural deliveries and selection of pitches. All of this favored 
the hitters on his club." Computers cannot pick this up, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
Bill proves his point convincingly. But, you don't really need a book when 
someone comes up to you with a whole bunch of printouts to tell you Babe Ruth 
would only hit .262 and Honus Wagner, .251. All you really have to do is say, 
"Gid oudda here!"

ROSE'S SELLING OF MEMORABILIA COMES UNDER SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM YANTZ, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MERIDEN, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The black bat rests on red velvet in a polished cedar case. Four strips of 
adhesive tape on the handle are worn where the hitter's hands once rested. 
</P>
<P>
Below the bat a proclamation reads: "On Aug. 11, 1986 Pete Rose used this bat 
to go 5-for-5 against the San Francisco Giants at Riverfront Stadium in 
Cincinnati. It was the 10th time in Pete's career that he'd hit safely five 
times in a game, thereby breaking the previous N.L. record." 
</P>
<P>
In the lower right corner of the case, there is a videocassette tape -- 
"Baseball The Pete Rose Way, Learn Baseball From a Living Legend." 
</P>
<P>
The tape has toppled from its upright position. 
</P>
<P>
Much the same way Pete Rose has fallen in recent weeks. Rose, the Cincinnati 
Reds' manager, is under investigation by the commissioner's office for, among 
other things, possibly betting on baseball games. His appetite for gambling has 
been documented as much as his hitting heroics once were. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Maslowski, owner of a video store, placed the Rose tape in the case after 
he won the bat at a video convention raffle in Las Vegas in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Maslowski said Embassy Video, which made the Rose video, raffled off a Rose 
glove, an autographed ball and the bat at the convention. Maslowski was told 
Embassy paid $4,000 for the bat. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to put (the bat) in the hotel safe," Maslowski said. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned home, he wanted his customers to see the bat, but took similar 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"I had this case made with the plexiglass cover and had it set on the wall," 
Maslowski said. "I probably could take the case apart, but it would be 
difficult. It's in there solid. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow the tape has fallen since then. Maybe somebody is trying to tell me 
something." 
</P>
<P>
The message to part-time Connecticut baseball collectors, such as Maslowski, 
and to those whose business is baseball memorabilia, is to be wary of Rose 
items. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service reportedly is investigating whether Rose fully 
reported income from Pik Six wagers at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., and 
income from the sale of personal memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rose prides himself on his achievements, he has sold many of his 
baseball possessions, including his diamond-studded Hickok Belt for being the 
outstanding professional athlete in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two weeks, it has been reported that five to 10 people have the 
bat that Rose used in 1985 when he set the major league record with his 4,192nd 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
Maslowski hopes his Rose bat is the real thing. He believes it is, but he has 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"When my wife Ronnie and I went to the convention, it was only one week after 
Rose went 5-for-5," Maslowski said. "I didn't think much of it then. But, now I 
wonder: 'Why would a player want to sell off this bat so quickly, one that he 
should keep forever?' Did he need $4,000 quickly? Was it all part of a gambling 
payoff? I don't know. God only knows the reason and if the bat is legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Robert Sakow, owner of Neil's American Dream Museum in West Hartford, 
Conn., said that he has about 7 million baseball cards in his museum and 
"hundreds of thousands" of baseball mementos. He said he sold a Rose rookie 
card in early April for $800. 
</P>
<P>
Cards are fine. But when the merchandise changes to Rose memorabilia, Ray 
Karaban, owner of Ray's Card Corner in Seymour, Conn., is reluctant to engage 
in that business. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that three or four years ago Rose was selling off his stuff," Karaban 
said. "Rose often would change his hat and uniforms between innings and then 
give them to a clubhouse kid to sell. It doesn't surprise me at all now to read 
about his selling of his memorabilia." 
</P>
<P>
Karaban has only one Rose memento in his store: an autographed 1975 Reds bat 
that also has Carl Yastrzemski's autograph. Rose was the Most Valuable Player 
of the '75 World Series between the Reds and the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Sakow said that Rose would not be the first ballplayer to sell duplicate items. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about there being duplicate shirts, caps and bats with Rose," Sakow 
said. "Unless I get a memento first-hand from the player or from someone I have 
complete trust in, I stay away from Rose memorabilia. It's a crap shoot. I 
pride myself at having blue-chip items. I don't consider the Pete Rose stuff in 
that class." 
</P>
<P>
Maslowski's bat has the Mizuno label, the brand Rose used in 1986. The end of 
the barrel has get-the-mud-out-of-your-spikes scuffs. Pete Rose's autograph and 
the Aug. 11, 1986 date are written on the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath Rose's autograph, the Mizuno label reads: "Genuine Pete Rose."

A TOUGH LESSON FOR ALL SPORTS AGENTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL OF WALTERS AND BLOOM MAY HELP CLEAN UP THE BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
No matter what verdict is reached in the trial of Norby Walters and Lloyd 
Bloom, it will help clean up the sports agents business, insiders said Monday 
as jurors deliberated a third day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the business is really starting to change now, and the indictments are 
a major reason for this," said Steve Zucker, an agent whose clients include 
Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Woolf, a Boston-based sports attorney whose clients include Larry Bird, Joe 
Montana and Doug Flutie, said he expects the verdict to have "a very positive 
impact" no matter what it is. 
</P>
<P>
A finding of guilty "would certainly be a sobering message to a lot of people 
out there . . . to a lot of the unscrupulous agents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're found innocent," he said, "the message is still out there. That 
abuses will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
The case of Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, went to the jury last Thursday after 
five weeks of testimony before U.S. District Judge George Marovich. Jurors took 
the weekend off before resuming deliberations Monday morning. They went home at 
5 p.m. CDT without a verdict, and were scheduled to resume deliberations 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based agents were accused of defrauding six universities and 
breaking other laws in signing college athletes to secret contracts before 
their college eligibility had expired. They also were accused of using threats 
to keep the athletes in line. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the agents defrauded the schools -- Iowa, Michigan, Michigan 
State, Notre Dame, Purdue and Temple -- of scholarship money by signing the 
athletes to contracts that violated NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argued that universities often kept athletes in school, 
despite poor grades, to promote their sports programs. They said Walters and 
Bloom were the victims of "double-dealing" athletes who took their money and 
later backed out of the deals. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Walters and Bloom also said the defendants were merely engaging 
in practices long accepted in the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
NFL players who testified at the trial included Ronnie Harmon of Buffalo, Paul 
Palmer of Kansas City and Mark Ingram of New York. They are among the 43 
players who signed with Walters and Bloom and avoided prosecution with pretrial 
agreements to perform community service and reimburse portions of their 
scholarships to their universities. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen states already have laws or proposed legislation that would make it a 
crime to pass money to athletes before their college eligibility has expired, 
Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, before the case of Walters and Bloom went to trial, only 
California and Oklahoma had such laws, Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Woolf also said new state laws aimed at regulating sports agents may mean a 
bureaucratic jungle. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is all the states now are passing laws governing agents so 
it's almost impossible for an individual to cope with all the rules and 
regulations in each state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that there are a lot of unscrupulous (agents)," Woolf 
said. "But there's a lot of good ones and we all get painted with the same 
brush."

A 20-year-old woman who told police she was raped in the Oklahoma University 
athletic dormitory in January testified that she could not identify the men who 
assaulted her because the room was dark. 
</P>
<P>
The woman testified at a Norman, Okla. preliminary hearing that will determine 
whether Oklahoma football players Nigel Clay, Glen Bell and Bernard Hall should 
stand trial for the Jan. 21 incident. 
</P>
<P>
The victim said she went to Norman for a double date. She testified they went 
to a room in the athletic dormitory, then to a liquor store and returned to the 
dorm. She said she had some drinks and then went to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said someone grabbed her by the shoulders and moved her into the 
bedroom as she left the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Clay, 20, of Fontana, and Hall, 22, of Detroit also face two counts each of 
giving alcohol to a minor. All three have been free on bond since shortly after 
their arrest Feb. 10. Bell, 20, is from Muskogee, Okla.

WITH WELCH ON THE MOUND, ANGELS SUFFER THROUGH VERY BLUE MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Welch wasn't exactly engulfed in the warmth of the holiday spirit when he 
found out the Dodgers had traded him to the Oakland Athletics shortly before 
Christmas in 1987. In fact, Welch, who made his major league debut for the 
Dodgers when he was just 21 and won 115 games over the next 10 seasons with 
them, felt a chill of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't take the lanky right-hander long to get over his Dodger blues. 
Less than six months after the trade, Welch was 8-2 and on his way to the first 
17-win season of his career, not to mention a trip to the World Series . . . 
against those Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Welch's visions of revenge didn't exactly work out in storybook fashion, but 
the A's failure to win a world championship didn't stop many experts from 
tabbing the A's as the next baseball dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
And it certainly didn't slow Welch, who came into the 1989 season locked into a 
sweet little groove. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Angels. Monday night, they managed just three hits -- a double 
just inside the first-base line, a bloop single and a ground-ball single up the 
middle -- in eight innings against Welch as the A's beat the Angels, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last four games (two in spring training, two this season), Bobby's 
been very effective at hitting his spots," catcher Ron Hassey said, "very 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
And when Welch is hitting his spots, the guys in the batter's box seldom hit 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
In his last two starts of the spring, he allowed a total of four hits and one 
earned run in 10 innings. Last week against Seattle, he pitched eight innings 
and gave up four hits and one run in an 11-1 Oakland romp. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, he struck out seven and walked one, retiring the first nine Angels in 
order and getting nine more in a row between the fifth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The only time Welch was in trouble was the fourth when Brian Downing led off 
with a double and the Angels had runners on second and third with one out after 
Devon White singled and stole second. Welch squeezed the life out of that 
rally, however, striking out Wally Joyner and Chili Davis to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner went down swinging, but Davis was called out by umpire Larry McCoy on a 
low, outside fastball. Davis was not particularly pleased with the call, but 
Welch felt justice had been served. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good pitch," he insisted. "I liked it. And he (McCoy) liked it and 
that's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the few pitches Welch threw that drew debate. Most of the rest 
drew rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Welch was outstanding," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "He threw all his 
pitches, on all counts to all locations. When hitters can't sit on anything, a 
pitcher's going to be all right. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Angels have some very good hitters in there. That was some piece of 
work tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who is off to a 2-0 start with an 0.56 earned-run average, says the key 
to all this success has been the ability to pinpoint his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw the breaking ball for strikes and the split-finger for strikes, but 
control of the fastball sets it all up," Welch said. "Both times out this year, 
I've had command of all three pitches, but when I can get groundouts on the 
outside fastball and jam people with the inside fastballs, it really helps." 
</P>
<P>
Welch admitted that he would have liked a shot at the ninth inning and a 
shutout, but he wasn't going to quibble with the decision of La Russa and Dave 
Duncan, the A's pitching coach, to remove him from the game because he had 
thrown 116 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good and still strong," Welch said, "but you don't want to throw a 
bunch of pitches early in the season and be dragging your butt by August." 
</P>
<P>
If he continues to pitch like he has the past few weeks, Welch may have 
surpassed last season's win total by August. And the only thing that will be 
dragging is the rest of the league's batting average.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
PITCHING IN TO KEEP EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Jennifer Brundage saw her first softball game more than seven years ago, 
it was the pitcher who caught her eye. She decided then, that was the position 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like fun, and I could be in control of the game," said Brundage, 15, 
now a sophomore pitcher for Irvine High School's softball team. 
</P>
<P>
Brundage, The Times' athlete of the week, has gotten better control of her 
breaking pitches with the help of her pitching coach, Ron LeFebvre. The 
Vaqueros have won their last seven consecutive games, and Brundage has pitched 
in six of them. 
</P>
<P>
"They are working a lot better now," she said of her curve, drop and rise 
pitches. "I can see them break better and I can tell by when I strike out more 
batters." 
</P>
<P>
Brundage has struck out 151 in 108 innings and has given up only four earned 
runs for an earned-run average of 0.26. 
</P>
<P>
She has raised her record to 8-5 and has helped Irvine turn its season around, 
going from 2-5 to 9-5. The Vaqueros' first nine games were against ranked teams 
and four of their five losses were 1-0 tiebreakers in extra innings, Irvine 
Coach Phil Dunmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Brundage has shut out Irvine's last three opponents. She pitched a one-hitter 
with eight strikeouts in a 3-0 victory over Woodbridge Tuesday. In a 
doubleheader Thursday against Foothill, she pitched a no-hitter with six 
strikeouts in the first game's 3-0 victory and pitched the final two outs to 
get the save in a 4-0 victory in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Her hitting has been impressive too, said Dunmeyer, who calls her "the finest 
high school hitter I have seen in 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
She is hitting .435 and has struck out only twice in 46 at-bats, Dunmeyer said. 
Her on-base percentage is .569. She leads the team with seven RBIs and has 
scored twice as many runs (12) as any teammate. She has two home runs and two 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Her leadership for being a sophomore and assuming the role has just been 
incredible," Dunmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Her desire to be in charge carries over to basketball, where she played point 
guard on the junior varsity this season. 
</P>
<P>
But basketball is more for recreation, Brundage said. "It's fun. Softball is 
fun too, but I'm more serious about it. There are more opportunities to go to 
college through softball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
TEAMING UP FOR A RECORD-SETTING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar High School had one of the best days in his 
career Saturday at the Arcadia Invitational track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle, The Times' athlete of the week, finished second in the 1,600 meters 
with a time of 4 minutes 11.94 seconds -- the fourth fastest time in the nation 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
A fine individual performance. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing compared to his teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle, a senior, was part of the distance medley relay team that set the 
Orange County record with a time of 10:09.71, breaking El Modena's mark of 
10:15.06 set in 1981. It also was a meet record and the fastest time in the 
nation this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad they don't run the distance medley at more meets," Lavelle said. 
"It really can bring a team together. We've had one of the best days running 
we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Which is saying a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle, Jay Lightburne and Greg Shryock -- who teamed with sprinter Mark 
Barnum in the relay -- have been running together since they were 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a pretty good youth program in this county, but it's dwindled 
in the last few years," Corona del Mar Coach Bill Sumner said. "Eddie, Jay and 
Greg are products of that program when it was at its height." 
</P>
<P>
All three ran for the Orange County Blue Angels, a club team in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about those days from time to time, nothing specific, just about how 
much fun it was," Lavelle said. "That's why it was really nice to get the 
record. It was something we had to each work equally to get." 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle ran the 1,600-meter leg of the race just two hours after finishing 
second in the 1,600. However, he didn't show much fatigue, as his time in the 
distance medley (4:13) was less than two seconds slower than his time in the 
1,600. 
</P>
<P>
"We've monitored Eddie for a few years, so we know he can come back in two 
hours," Sumner said. "We know what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle anchored the race, with Shryock leading off in the 1,200 meters. 
Lightburne, the 800, and Barnum, the 400, were in the middle events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've run together so long, but we've never run like that. That's what made 
it so special," said Lavelle, who orally committed Monday to attend Notre Dame 
on a track and field and cross-country scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Eric Grove of Tustin had a two-run homer in a 2-1 victory over Saddleback 
Wednesday. He also had three hits and an RBI in a 10-2 victory over Corona del 
Mar Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Johnson of Villa Park had two home runs and seven runs batted in against 
Canyon Friday -- all in the same inning. Johnson hit a three-run homer in the 
first inning and hit a grand slam later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
James Johnson of La Quinta had two home runs, four RBIs and scored four runs in 
a 17-9 victory over Santiago Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Muniz of Woodbridge won the 110-meter hurdles in 15.09 and the 300 
hurdles in 39.16, and was named the running athlete of the meet at the Orange 
County track and field championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Obergfell of Irvine pitched nine scoreless innings in three games last 
week. He went two-thirds of an inning for the victory on Monday, pitched 4 2/3 
innings on Wednesday and went 3 2/3 innings for a save on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
John Rodriguez of Orange went six for seven with six RBIs in victories over 
Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach. He also had a save against Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia set meet records in the long jump (22-10) and 
triple jump (50-3) at the Orange County track and field championships Saturday. 
His distance in the triple jump was only one-half inch of tying the county 
record of 50-3 1/2 set by Ken Williams of Troy in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
Corona del Mar High 
</P>
<P>
Position: Distance runner 
</P>

NORTHRIDGE VOLLEYBALL SQUAD COMES UP SHORT IN UPSET BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge men's volleyball Coach John Price is going to make an 
audio tape. On that tape, he will record "We're a good team, but our passing 
broke down." 
</P>
<P>
The tape would have come in handy Monday night, when the Matadors lost to UCLA, 
15-3, 12-15, 15-9, 14-16, 15-3, in a Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
match at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time this season, Northridge stretched the nation's top-ranked 
team to five games before losing. In February, Northridge lost at Stanford, 
then the No. 1 team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say," Price said. "Our passing breaks down, our hitting 
breaks down and the guys try to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN (8-19, 2-14 in conference play) trailed 9-7 in the fourth game after 
dropping two of the first three games, but rallied to tie the match. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Samuelson, who finished with a game-high 34 kills, had six kills as 
Northridge rallied to tie at 14-14. Setter Tom Ribarich put Northridge ahead, 
15-14, on an ace serve that barely cleared the net, and after six side outs, 
the Matadors took the game on a Bruin error. 
</P>
<P>
But any momentum the Matadors took into the fifth game was quickly doused when 
UCLA (25-3, 14-1) jumped to a 6-0 lead. The Bruins readjusted their blocking 
scheme on Samuelson and he failed to execute a spike during the run.

JILTING PARRETTI, NEW WORLD SELLS OUT TO PERELMAN FOR $145 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York entrepreneur Ronald O. Perelman stole a march on the competition 
Monday with the surprise announcement of a definitive agreement to buy New 
World Entertainment for $145 million. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks earlier, the Los Angeles-based television production company had 
signed a tentative deal to sell out to Hollywood newcomer Giancarlo Parretti 
for $138 million. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews Group, a publicly traded company controlled by Perelman, is buying New 
World. Andrews' chief executive, William C. Bevins Jr., said in an interview 
that the move is part of a plan to become "a meaningful player in the 
entertainment and media businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Perelman, a corporate raider who controls Revlon Group and recently agreed to 
buy Coleman Co. for $545 million, had seemed to be getting out of 
entertainment. Last fall, he sold Technicolor to Britain's Carlton 
Communications for $780 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Halt Movie Investments 
</P>
<P>
In January, however, he bought New World's Marvel Entertainment Group, 
publisher of Marvel comic books, for $82.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bevins, former financial chief for cable television pioneer Ted Turner, said 
Monday that he is mainly interested in New World's television production and 
distribution facilities and sees no reason to make management changes in those 
areas. New World's TV productions include "The Wonder Years" and "Tour of Duty" 
for network prime time and the daytime soap "Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Bevins said he has "very little interest" in any theatrical film production 
investments and indicated that he will "substantially reduce or eliminate" 
risking capital in that area. New World's movie production program has been a 
failure in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time New World signed its deal with Andrews, it exercised its right 
to cancel its deal with Parretti because the Andrews proposal "provides greater 
value for New World shareholders," according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti, who last year obtained control of Cannon Group and recently renamed 
it Pathe, has been seeking to put together a larger U.S. entertainment 
operation. However, the controversial Italian also has failed to acquire two of 
his proclaimed targets, MGM/UA Communications and De Laurentiis Entertainment 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, Parretti said late Monday that Pathe had been invited to 
submit a higher offer but declined to be "drawn into a bidding contest which 
pushes the price beyond New World's utility to us." He said Pathe will receive 
a termination fee of $3 million from New World under their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews Group is to begin a tender offer of $8.95 a share in cash for New World 
common stock within five business days, the parties announced. They said they 
expect to close their merger shortly after completion of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti had agreed in late February to pay $8.20 a share for New World -- 
$3.40 in cash and a non-interest-bearing note valued at $4.80 payable April 2, 
1990. At the time, some observers were skeptical about the ultimate value of 
the notes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Swap for Executives 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., a Los Angeles securities 
firm, said Monday that Perelman appeared to be a "much stronger buyer" and the 
all-cash terms a better deal for New World shareholders. He noted that Perelman 
has "people who understand the (entertainment) industry well, have deep pockets 
and know-how to operate." 
</P>
<P>
The holders of a majority of New World's voting power -- Co-Chairmen Harry 
Evans Sloan, Lawrence L. Kuppin and Robert Rehme -- have agreed to swap most of 
their New World holdings for securities of an Andrews Group affiliate if a 
majority of public shareholders agree to sell their shares in the tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan and Kuppin, who acquired New World in 1983, will remain "in a consulting 
capacity," Bevins said. Arrangements with Rehme, who is chief executive, "have 
not been discussed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bevins, who maintains an office in Beverly Hills, said he joined Andrews Group 
last July and began looking for investment opportunities in entertainment and 
media. Although the firm until now has not acquired any media properties, 
Bevins said he will "look at almost everything that comes available," whether 
in publishing or in broadcast and cable properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manageable Risks 
</P>
<P>
When Andrews bought Marvel from New World in January, he said, Kuppin and Sloan 
were not interested in selling the television operations. When it appeared that 
New World itself was going to be sold, Bevins added, Andrews studied the 
company and submitted an offer on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He said New World has a strong television group with "a nice, solid record of 
quality productions," such as "The Wonder Years," which has "some nice 
long-term upside" potential. He said he is "intrigued" by the programming 
business and finds the risk is more manageable there than in theatrical films. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews Group had identified and targeted television production as an 
attractive investment long ago, Bevins said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"Opportunity knocked and we answered."

FCA SETTLEMENT PLAN TO LET KNAPP KEEP $2-MILLION PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles W. Knapp, former head of Financial Corp. of America, will get to keep 
his controversial $2-million severance payment under a proposed settlement to 
end litigation against the now-bankrupt savings and loan holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp received the severance pay after federal thrift regulators ousted him as 
FCA chairman and chief executive in 1984 in the midst of a deposit run. He 
received the payment from FCA's board in return for his agreement to resign, 
but FCA later sued to recover the money on the grounds that it was grossly 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to drop the claim against Knapp was part of a settlement agreement 
disclosed Monday in which FCA will receive $51.9 million from Arthur Andersen 
&amp; Co., the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. and International 
Insurance Co. The money will be used toward settling suits and claims filed by 
FCA's former stockholders, bondholders and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen is FCA's former auditor while International Insurance provided 
the liability insurance policy for the company's former officers and directors. 
The FSLIC got involved in litigation settlement talks after it placed FCA's 
operating subsidiary, American Savings, into receivership last September. 
</P>
<P>
FCA is now being liquidated by bankruptcy trustee David A. Gill. He filed the 
settlement in bankruptcy court in Santa Ana, where FCA is seeking to liquidate 
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The proposed settlement now must 
be approved by the bankruptcy court and federal court in Los Angeles, where 
several shareholder lawsuits are pending. 
</P>
<P>
The claim against Knapp, now an investment banker in Los Angeles, will be 
handled by International Insurance, said Richard K. Diamond, Gill's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unit Sold to Bass 
</P>
<P>
Knapp's attorney, Arthur N. Greenberg, confirmed the agreement, saying Knapp 
won't pay anything to settle the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago FCA was the nation's largest savings and loan company, 
with assets of more than $32 billion, but began a tailspin five years ago 
because of heavy losses on real estate development loans. American Savings was 
sold last December to Texas investor Robert M. Bass. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the litigation involving FCA was filed by angry shareholders who saw 
their investments virtually wiped out by the receivership. Among their charges 
were that FCA's management improperly speculated in the company's stock and 
paid improper bonuses to directors and officers to meet margin calls on FCA 
stock, according to the settlement papers filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
FCA, under the new management that replaced Knapp, also sued Arthur Andersen in 
1986, charging the accounting firm with being negligent in its role as FCA's 
outside auditor from 1974 to 1983. That suit will be also be settled if the 
proposed agreement is approved.

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: HOLLYWOOD MAY TAKE THE DRAMA OUT OF SETTLING DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An era of labor-management peace in the nation's film and television industry 
just might come out of last year's devastating writers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate giants and tens of thousands of employees suffered such heavy 
losses from the strike that industry and union leaders alike at last seem to 
realize that it doesn't make sense to bash each other every time their 
contracts expire. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive unity of members of the Writers Guild of America shut down the 
industry for 154 days, the longest strike in Hollywood history. It ended Aug. 
5, but the aftershocks rumbled on till December, as the networks continued 
using reruns until full production resumed. 
</P>
<P>
The compromises that ended the acrimonious struggle left both sides claiming 
that they were content with the settlement. But now they talk earnestly about 
avoiding another one. 
</P>
<P>
Film industry workers aren't strike-happy. The Screen Actors Guild, for 
instance, has had only five major strikes in its 56-year history. When they 
come, though, they are dillies. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan exaggerated only slightly when as SAG president 
in 1960 he said the actors' union is the only one that doesn't have to put up 
picket lines when it strikes; the members just stay in bed and production 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
Even without strikes, though, the industry suffers when contract deadlines 
near. Studios either race at great cost to complete films or don't start 
productions that might not be finished before a potential strike. 
</P>
<P>
The first harbinger of a less confrontational future came last month when SAG 
and the American Federation of Television &amp; Radio Artists reached agreement 
with the industry more than three months before the expiration of their 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The industry had already started going into its usual, expensive pre-strike 
preparation when SAG Executive Director Ken Orsatti offered what sounded like a 
hard-line contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was a realistic proposal that included concessions management had 
already won from the writers and other unions. In return, the industry only had 
to give some good but hardly exorbitant increases to the actors. 
</P>
<P>
The industry accepted. The actors' pact was historic because never before had a 
film industry agreement been reached so early. But two other factors offer the 
real hope for less adversarial relations: 
</P>
<P>
* Broadcast TV networks, the biggest buyers of films, are losing huge hunks of 
their markets to pay TV, cable, videocassettes and independent TV stations. The 
networks cannot rationally risk more market losses and so should put heavy 
pressure on the studios to avoid another crippling strike if at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
* Cooperative union-management committees are being created to discuss problems 
as they arise and possibly resolve them before they reach a crisis stage and 
become strike issues. Some unions have had labor-management committees before 
but rarely used them. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the committees should deal with that perennial problem of 
residuals, the additional money paid to actors and others when the films or 
shows they work on are repeated or sold to other outlets such as 
videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Complex formulas are used to determine the amount of the residuals, and the 
formulas vary. The one for sales to free TV differs from the one used for, say, 
videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
As sales increase in one market and decrease in another, actors and others who 
get residuals will certainly want to review the old formulas. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Last year, for instance, so-called supplemental markets such as 
videocassettes paid actors $29 million while sales of theatrical films to free 
TV brought them $19 million. Eight years ago, the situation was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Revising the formulas might mean more money for residual earners, so why not 
start now to work out solutions to that and other problems? 
</P>
<P>
A peaceful future isn't assured. There are factors that might work against that 
happy day. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many years ago, movie moguls such as Jack Warner and Sam Goldwyn loved 
to make barrels of money, but also loved making movies. Both of their joys 
stopped when labor troubles halted production. 
</P>
<P>
These days, corporate tycoons own conglomerates that include businesses other 
than studios and networks. They may enjoy movie-making, but money seems to be 
their primary goal. So if production is stopped by a film industry strike, 
their income may be slowed, but money can still roll in from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
That means they could afford to be hard-nosed about film industry union 
contracts even if it means taking a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, owner of Columbia, could keep earning money from sales of soft 
drinks and other products. Walt Disney's Disneyland, Disney World and other 
non-film production operations would continue bringing in a bundle for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
But these companies, too, presumably learned from the writers' strike that 
there ought to be a better way to make money than battling with their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Some strikes may be unavoidable. The one that gained residuals was certainly 
worth it to the actors, who have earned $1.2 billion in residuals since they 
began in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, at least, union and management leaders are talking about more 
intelligent ways of settling their inevitable differences over who will get how 
much of that huge money pie their joint efforts produce.

Looking for Prospects: Beatrice Co. said it is looking for acquisitions in a 
policy switch following three years of rapid-fire divestitures. Beatrice was 
taken private in a 1986 leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; 
Co. Beatrice has sold several of its holdings, including the Avis car rental 
firm, the Tropicana juice business and underwear-maker Playtex. Proceeds were 
used to pay down debt. The company's remaining businesses are almost all 
food-related, and Chief Executive Fred Rentschler said he's looking for 
businesses compatible with operations such as Beatrice's Swift-Eckrich meat 
division or its Hunt-Wesson food operations.

Dow Jones &amp; Co.: The New York-based media company said first-quarter profit 
nearly doubled to $200 million from a year ago because of a big one-time gain 
from the sale of a cable television investment. But weakness in financial 
advertising drove its operating income down by 12.5%. Revenue rose 3.6% to 
$406.8 million. The latest results included an after-tax gain of $164.1 million 
from the sale in January of the company's 17% stake in Continental Cablevision 
Inc., a cable system operator. The 1988 results included a gain of $64.4 
million from the sale of a book publishing subsidiary, Richard D. Irwin Inc.

MERRILL LYNCH EX-TRADER FACES SEC HEARING

A former Merrill Lynch mortgage trader whose allegedly unauthorized 
transactions resulted in heavy trading losses for the firm will face a hearing 
on fraud charges, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC charged that Howard A. Rubin, the former head mortgage-backed 
securities trader at Merrill Lynch Government Securities, willfully violated 
federal anti-fraud laws in connection with trades in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"A hearing will be scheduled to determine whether the allegations against Rubin 
are true, and if so, to decide what remedial action, if any, is appropriate," 
Edwin H. Nordlinger, deputy regional administrator of the SEC's New York 
office, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
If Rubin is found guilty, he could face sanctions ranging from the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Temporary suspension from securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
* Limited trading activities. 
</P>
<P>
* Lifetime ban from the business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outstanding Reputation' 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who was fired from Merrill Lynch, works as a mortgage securities trader 
at Bear Stearns &amp; Co., a spokeswoman for the latter firm said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing Rubin, Ira Lee Sorkin, said Rubin denies he committed 
any fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"He has had an outstanding reputation in the industry and an unblemished 
record," Sorkin said. "And we intend to litigate this matter to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
Sorkin said the SEC's action appears based entirely on an allegation that Rubin 
did not follow his supervisors' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"How the SEC regards this as a violation of the federal securities laws is 
beyond our imagination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allegedly unauthorized transactions by Rubin while he was at Merrill Lynch were 
blamed by the company as a major reason for huge trading losses that cut the 
investment firm's pretax earnings by about $275 million in the second quarter 
of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions involved hundreds of millions of dollars of certain types of 
mortgage-backed securities, which represent mortgages that are pooled and then 
packaged as marketable securities for sale to investors.

More Traders in Trouble: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has charged 
22 traders with profiting through a scheme to prearrange trades for U.S. 
Treasury bond futures contracts. The agency, in a six-count administrative 
complaint, said the 22 executed a series of bogus transactions with a floor 
broker on the Chicago Board of Trade in July, 1986. The CFTC said a hearing 
will be scheduled before an administrative law judge. The accused traders face 
possible penalties ranging from fines of $100,000 per violation to revocation 
or suspension of their licenses and trading privileges.

NEW KOREAN AIRLINE GIVES BOEING $1-BILLION ORDER

A new South Korean airline with plans for service to Europe and North America 
announced Monday a deal worth about $1 billion to buy nine Boeing Co. jetliners 
and take options on seven more. 
</P>
<P>
Including the new agreement with fledgling Asiana Airlines, Seattle-based 
Boeing has announced orders for 110 jetliners worth $8.7 billion so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Asiana, based in Seoul, began operations within South Korea on Dec. 23. It said 
it will use its new jets to expand to other Asian markets and eventually to 
North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Asiana ordered five 737-400s and took options for another five. It also signed 
letters of intent to order two 747-400 jumbo jets and take options for two 
more, and to convert two previous options for widebody 767-300s to firm orders. 
</P>
<P>
A 747-400, the world's largest passenger jet, sells for $116 million to $136 
million, depending on configuration and equipment, Boeing said. The smaller 
737-400 twin-jet sells for $31 million to $36 million, while a widebody 767-300 
goes for $66 million to $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, we could have saved a few dollars by buying or leasing 
older planes," S. Y. Park, chairman of Kumho Business Group, Asiana's parent 
company, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"However, a new airline has enough problems establishing its market base 
without the burden of heavy maintenance responsibilities and the uncertainty of 
whether older planes will perform reliably." Park said other aircraft 
manufacturers had talked about selling planes to Asiana, "but at first, others 
didn't take us seriously. Boeing did take us seriously." 
</P>
<P>
J. F. Chorlton, a Boeing vice president, said Asiana had indicated an interest 
in Boeing aircraft as early as a year ago. He said Boeing had made room on its 
production line for the planes before the order was announced.

FORD CHAIRMAN'S EARNINGS: $10.5 MILLION

<P>
Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen earned $10.5 million in compensation 
last year, mainly from exercising stock options, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Ford announced the appointments of three new executive vice 
presidents including Allan Gilmour, who is considered Petersen's likely 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
The compensation for Petersen and four other top executives was detailed in 
Ford's annual proxy statement, which is being mailed to shareholders in advance 
of the company's May 11 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was the nation's most profitable auto maker last year with earnings of 
$5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen got $3.3 million in salary, bonuses and other benefits and gained $7.2 
million from exercising stock options last year. His compensation topped the 
$3.7 million Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca received for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ford President Harold Poling earned $4.1 million, including $2.6 million in 
salary and other compensation and $1.5 million from exercised stock options. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ford reported that Petersen exercised no stock options and received 
$3.7 million. Poling last year exercised stock options worth $8 million and 
received $10.9 million in total compensation. 
</P>
<P>
United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice President Stephen Yokich, 
who heads the union's Ford Department, criticized the payments as part of 
"Detroit's annual executive pigout." 
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be far better advised to invest in new facilities and hire 
more employees rather than squander valuable resources on trying to keep up 
with the 'junk bond' barons," they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stock options of other 
Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement: 
</P>
<P>
* Louis R. Ross, executive vice president for North American automotive 
operations and named Monday as executive vice president for international 
automotive operations, $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Philip Benton, executive vice president and president of the Ford Automotive 
Group, $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Gilmour, Ross' predecessor in international operations who was appointed 
executive vice president for corporate staffs, $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Because Gilmour was the only one of the three also named to the office of the 
chief executive -- which is shared by Petersen, Poling and Executive Vice 
President Stanley Seneker, the company's chief financial officer -- he is seen 
as the likely choice to succeed Petersen when he reaches Ford's mandatory 
retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Sr., grandson of the 
company's founder, retired from the company and his title was eliminated. Ford, 
who was a member of the office of the chief executive, will remain a member of 
the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The appointments of Gilmour, Ross and Alexander Trotman, who succeeds Ross, 
become effective May 1.

Standard &amp; Poors Corp. and Moody's Investors Service have affirmed their 
high credit ratings for St. Joseph Health System in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of St. Joseph, a nonprofit operator of several hospitals and the 
Health Plan of America health maintenance organization, made their biannual 
presentation to the financial rating services in December. S&amp;P gave the 
company an A+ rating; Moody's gave it an A1. 
</P>
<P>
The "A" rating is considered "investment grade," indicating a minimal risk that 
a corporate bond issue will default. 
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals have experienced downgradings in credit ratings over the past 
several years in the face of lower occupancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strong occupancy rates . . . as well as positive performance projections 
for the next 5 years persuaded the agencies to continue our high ratings," said 
President Robert O'Leary.

Bond prices were flat Monday, reflecting reluctance of traders to speculate on 
the direction of interest rates before the release of government economic 
reports at the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond finished unchanged, while its yield remained at 
9.11%. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department on Thursday will reveal figures on March retail sales. 
Government reports are scheduled for Friday on the merchandise trade deficit 
for February, wholesale prices for March, industrial production and factory use 
for March, and business inventories for February. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers could provide important insights into the direction of the 
economy, the level of inflation and whether the Federal Reserve will tighten or 
relax credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporate Prices Up a Little 
</P>
<P>
"The market is pretty much gearing itself for the numbers at the end of the 
week," said Peter Hegel, first vice president in charge of mutual fund trading 
at Van Kampen Merritt Inc. in Lisle, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short- and 
intermediate-term government securities were unchanged to 3/32 lower and 
long-term issues were unchanged to 1/16 point higher, the Telerate Inc. 
financial reporting service said. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 0.23 to 1,120.84. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, prices rose marginally. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, increased 0.36 to 299.45. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, municipal bond prices were little changed. The Bond 
Buyer index was not available late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Funds Rate Rises 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 9.03% as the discount fell 7 basis 
points to 8.73%. Yields on six-month bills rose 3 basis points as the discount 
rose to 8.78%. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 9.50% and the 
discount stayed at 8.75%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.813%, up from 9.75% late Friday.

To take advantage of the company's low stock price, directors of ICN 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. recently authorized the firm to purchase up to 4 million 
shares of ICN common stock. ICN said it will buy the shares over a 3-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Under two previously announced buyback programs, the company was authorized to 
purchase up to 6 million shares of stock. So far, 5.5 million shares have been 
repurchased under the programs. On Nov. 30, ICN had 15.8 million shares 
outstanding, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the repurchase plan reflects ICN's strong earnings performance 
for its fiscal 1988 and its belief that shares are undervalued at current 
prices. ICN reported net income of $17.8 million, with revenue of $166 million, 
for fiscal 1988 ended Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
ICN stock has been trading most of this year at about $6.50 per share on the 
New York Stock Exchange. The stock price was as high as $30 per share in 1987.

COPPER FUTURES PRICES RISE AMID CONCERN OVER SUPPLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Copper futures prices posted significant gains Monday at the New York Commodity 
Exchange on concerns about tight supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, unleaded gasoline led a modest rally in energy futures, sugar 
futures were clobbered by profit taking and live hog futures advanced on 
speculation that marketings would drop as farmers concentrated on spring 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
The move in copper followed an erratic performance last week, when the metal 
skyrocketed last Wednesday on the heels of five straight slumping sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Copper at the Comex began the day strong, shrugged off reports of higher than 
expected stocks at the London Mercantile Exchange, broke an important 
resistance level at $1.38 per pound and held the gains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gold, Silver Higher 
</P>
<P>
"Several producers are supposed to be experiencing tightness, but we had one 
report out of Chile that there are actual problems supplying," said William 
O'Neill, director of research for Elders Futures Inc., New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, we got rumors that a major New York trading house was looking to take a 
substantial amount out of the Comex warehouse and refine it into high-grade 
copper," he added. "The speculation is that it may be related to a shortage one 
of the producers is experiencing." 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices settled 6.60 to 7.80 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in April at $1.416 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Among the precious metals, gold advanced $2.30 to $2.60, with April on the 
Comex at $386 an ounce; silver was 5.2 to 6.4 cents higher, with April at 
$5.821 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline was the surprise leader among the energy futures because demand for 
the product doesn't peak until the start of the summer driving season. Monday's 
rally also looked past reports that several OPEC members were ignoring 
production quotas, pushing the cartel's daily output to 20 million barrels per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil rose 2 to 57 cents, with the May contract at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange settling at $20.59 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to 1.85 cents 
higher, with May at 53.45 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent 
to 2.25 cents higher, with May at 67.20 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures were 0.32 to 0.50 cent lower on the New York Coffee, Cocoa and 
Sugar Exchange, with the May contract at 11.88 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"The recent strength had as much to do with today's loss as anything," said 
Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. New York. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many rumors going around about buys by this country or that and 
a lot of people got nervous and started taking profits in case none of it 
materializes," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, rumors that Mexico bought as much as 280,000 tons in recent days 
made the rounds just minutes after the market closed. 
</P>
<P>
Live hog futures were the only positive note in the complex at the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Many pork producers grow their own feed and now is the time they start field 
preparations for the feed crops," said Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.

PRICE OF AVERAGE HOME BARELY RISES IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County home prices rose less than 1% in March to an average of $225,335, 
according to TRW Real Estate Market Information. 
</P>
<P>
The figure includes new and used houses and condominiums. Last month the 
average price was $224,057. A year ago the average was $178,451, 26% lower than 
now. 
</P>
<P>
According to TRW, home prices actually fell between February and March of 1988, 
a year that set a record for home sales and pushed local housing prices to 
among the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But housing experts say it is unlikely that last year's buying frenzy can be 
repeated this year, although sales should remain strong. For instance, the 
number of houses and condos sold in March dropped well below the number sold a 
year ago, TRW said. Last year 4,975 were sold in March, this year only 4,583 -- 
an 8% decline. 
</P>
<P>
New home sales were down even further this year, by 20%, as only 806 were sold 
in March compared to 1,014 a year ago. That may reflect simply the smaller 
numbers of new homes and condos being built early in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
TRW, however, said it noted a large number of new construction loans toward the 
end of 1988 and said that might betoken a string of new subdivision openings 
this month or the next.

INTEL INTRODUCES COMPUTER CHIP TWICE AS FAST AS 80386 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In the latest entry in the race to develop faster computer chips, Intel Corp. 
on Monday announced its long-awaited next-generation microprocessor. It 
immediately drew praise from a Who's Who of computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said its new chip is more than twice as 
fast as the 80386 microprocessor, or computer "brain," now used in many 
top-of-the-line personal computers. Intel's introduction of the chip was made 
at Comdex, a computer trade show being held here through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new Intel 80486 chip is viewed as a challenge to archrival Motorola Inc., 
which two weeks ago introduced details of its newest chip, the 68040. 
</P>
<P>
Intel's chips are used in International Business Machines Corp. personal 
computers and compatible machines, while Motorola's are used in Apple 
Computer's Macintosh and in workstations made by Sun Microsystems and other 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither the Intel nor Motorola chips will be available until late this 
year, the scramble has already begun to design computers and software that will 
take advantage of the new technology. Advances in chip technology have far 
outpaced improvements elsewhere in the computer business. In fact, chip 
advances have come so quickly that, analysts say, software writers have yet to 
fully exploit the power of the 80386 chip. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday, Intel trotted out a cast of industry luminaries to 
praise the 80486 chip. More important, 11 PC makers -- including Southern 
California companies Tandon, AST Research and Advanced Logic Research -- and 
several major software companies said they would come out with products to take 
advantage of the chip. 
</P>
<P>
"The 486 chip is a fantastic advance," said William Gates, chairman of 
Microsoft Corp., a personal computer software giant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Huge Leap Forward' 
</P>
<P>
Rod Canion, chairman of Compaq Computer, called the 80486 chip "a huge leap 
forward in performance." He said his company planned to develop products for 
the new 80486 chip as well as an enhanced version of the 80386 chip, which 
Intel also announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives said the 80486 chip will run software programs much faster 
than is possible now and allow PCs to run sophisticated graphics programs that 
used to require larger, more expensive machines known as minicomputers. 
</P>
<P>
"The 80486 is clearly taking things well beyond the PC range and moving us into 
the minicomputer market," Canion said. 
</P>
<P>
A key feature of the 80486 chip is that it is fully compatible with the older 
80386. That means that software used in 80386 computers will also work with the 
80486 machines when they hit the market, probably in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Intel announced an agreement with Prime Computer, a Massachusetts 
minicomputer maker, to develop a chip that will be even faster than the 80486. 
Intel said the new chip, which it expects to introduce in 1992, will pave the 
way for PCs as powerful as today's mainframe computers, the refrigerator-size 
machines found in large businesses, universities and elsewhere.

GAS JUMPED 10 CENTS A GALLON IN 3 WEEKS ACROSS U.S. 
</P>

<P>
The price of a gallon of gasoline climbed more than a dime at the nation's 
pumps in the past 3 weeks, spurred partly by fears of shortages due to the 
Alaska oil spill, an oil industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"Retail gasoline prices nationwide showed the largest and fastest price rise in 
the history of the U.S. gasoline market," said Trilby Lundberg, whose Los 
Angeles-based Lundberg Newsletter regularly surveys more than 12,000 gasoline 
stations throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg, in a telephone interview Sunday, said the average price of a gallon 
of gasoline, including taxes, jumped 10.24 cents, from 100.39 cents a gallon 
March 17 to 110.63 cents April 7. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have just seen is an almost instantaneous national reaction to the 
brief cutoff of a quarter of the nation's oil supply due to the disaster in 
Alaska," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Independent refiners were the first to experience oil shortages -- especially 
in California, where 40% of the crude oil comes from Alaska -- and prices 
jumped, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortage fears accelerated the increased demand, and prices continued to rise 
until the flow of crude oil was resumed from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg noted, however, that there were other contributing factors to the 
increase aside from the spill of 10.1 million gallons of oil March 24 when the 
Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
"The wholesale prices were rising noticeably prior to the Alaska disaster," she 
said. "These price increases were the results of three elements. Cutbacks in 
refinery output, higher prices in the import markets . . . and finally, higher 
prices from U.S. refiners to head off possible shortages by dampening demand 
and thus preventing panic buying." 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the average price at self-service stations -- where over 
80% of consumer gasoline sales are made -- was 100.96 cents for regular 
unleaded, 115.80 for premium leaded and 100.56 for regular leaded. 
</P>
<P>
At full-service stations, regular unleaded was 126.58, premium unleaded 138.07 
and regular leaded 124.22. 
</P>
<P>
Although there will probably be some stabilization now that oil shipments have 
resumed, Lundberg said that the factors that lead to price increases all year 
long are continuing and that further pressure will come once the summer driving 
season begins. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency is over. However, no one should expect an immediate drop of 
those 10 pennies, because of factors not related to the Alaska disaster, such 
as the relative stronger international crude oil prices and the seasonality of 
gasoline demand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The only other time prices were at a level similar to the current price was in 
the beginning of 1980 after the Iranian oil embargo threatened supplies and 
sent spot markets soaring, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The price kept rising and peaked out in March, 1981, at almost $1.38 a gallon. 
In early 1986, the price of crude oil crashed and the price of gasoline at the 
pumps plummeted.

DECLINE IN MERGER ACTIVITY IS MISLEADING, EXPERTS SAY

<P>
If you go by the numbers, U.S. mergers and acquisitions fell sharply in the 
first quarter of 1989 compared to the frenzy of last year, but experts say the 
figures are misleading and the outlook for more takeovers is good. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as anything but a fluctuation," said Louis Lowenstein, 
professor of corporate finance at Columbia University's School of Law. "Nothing 
fundamental has changed." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers -- at least on the surface -- indicate that merger activity slowed 
from January through March. Mergers and corporate transactions announced during 
the first quarter fell to 340 from 410 in the same period of 1988, according to 
statistics compiled by Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J., research firm. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions include recapitalizations and stock buybacks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of the deals also plunged, to $74.36 billion in the latest 
quarter from $137.17 billion a year earlier, Securities Data said. 
</P>
<P>
But the people who follow merger activity attach little significance to the 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Simply Cyclical Activity' 
</P>
<P>
"It's much too short a period from which to draw any conclusions," said Isaac 
Shapiro, a partner in the law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, which 
has a large practice in mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think quarter-to-quarter statistics mean a lot," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Margotta, an assistant professor at Northeastern University in Boston, 
agreed, saying, "It's not significant enough." 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply cyclical activity," Margotta said. "Mergers have gone through 
cycles -- there are lows and there are peaks." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there's no reason for merger activity to fall off, the professor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic forces driving the market are still there," Lowenstein said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average doesn't seem to be making much 
progress, eight San Diego stocks made new annual highs during the past week, 
said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The highs included Home Federal at $34.75 as analysts continue to warm to its 
excellent earnings prospects for 1989. Home Federal's Robert Adelizzi will 
speak to the San Diego Stock &amp; Bond Club on Thursday and to the Financial 
Analysts' "Investing in San Diego '89" all-day seminar May 24. 
</P>
<P>
Among the local stocks making new highs were Psicor, Christiana, Beeba's 
Creations, First National Corp., BSD Bancorp, Infrasonics and Medical Imaging 
Centers. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher Scientific gained $1.50 for the week as the company announced it was 
considering the disposal of its IMED and Instrumentation Laboratory divisions. 
</P>
<P>
New 52-week lows this week were made by Imperial Corp., Synbiotics and Xscribe.

ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES LEAD AS STOCKS CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices for most San Fernando Valley-area companies rose during the first 
quarter of the year, led by entertainment companies and firms that may be 
takeover candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers outnumbered losers 3 to 2 for the quarter that ended March 31. Of 56 
stocks of major companies in the Valley area, 31 rose in price in the quarter, 
20 fell, and five were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The results, compiled for The Times by Communications Research Group of Austin, 
Tex., included stocks of companies with headquarters in the area from Glendale 
to Camarillo, whose shares traded publicly for more than $3 at the start of the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, stocks rose during the quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average, the 
most widely followed stock barometer, rose in the same period 5.8%, or 125.05 
points, to close at 2293.62. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest gainer for the quarter was a puzzle. The stock of Networks 
Electronic Corp., a Chatsworth maker of bearings and explosive devices, jumped 
84% to $7.13 a share. The company has declined to comment on the increase. 
Company board members and analysts have said they are unaware of any reason why 
the stock would jump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UES Stock Plunges 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser was United Education &amp; Software, an Encino chain of 
vocational schools. The company's stock fell from $3.63 a share to $1.50 in the 
quarter. United Education's stock, which traded as high as $16 a share a year 
ago, has taken a drubbing the past few months after a government-led review 
found widespread problems in a unit the company formerly owned that tracked 
student loans for clients via computer. 
</P>
<P>
Live Entertainment, a Newbury Park conglomerate that produces and distributes 
films on videocassette, was the biggest gainer among entertainment companies. 
The company's stock rose 35% to $28 a share in the quarter. In March, Live 
Entertainment reported that it earned $10.6 million in the fourth quarter ended 
Dec. 31, compared to a profit of $1.3 million a year earlier, with sales rising 
54% to $132 million. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Walt Disney, the Burbank entertainment giant that continues 
posting improved profits because of strong performances by its theme parks, 
rose 19% in the quarter to $78.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'E.T.' Boosts MCA 
</P>
<P>
Another gainer was MCA, the Universal City giant whose earnings soared to a 
record $75.7 million in the fourth quarter, largely because of videocassette 
sales of Steven Spielberg's "E.T. -- The Extra-Terrestrial." MCA's stock rose 
16% in price to $52.75 a share. Last week, reports surfaced that Japan's Sony 
Corp. was about to buy MCA. Sony quickly denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Among takeover candidates, Dataproducts, a Woodland Hills maker of computer 
printers, rose 24% to $16.75. A New York investment group that owns about 7% of 
the firm's stock had said it wants to buy the company. In response, 
Dataproducts' directors authorized the company's investment bankers to look for 
other prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of St. Ives Laboratories, a Chatsworth maker of shampoo and skin 
creams, rose 82% to $16.13 a share on Wall Street rumors that the company might 
be bought. St. Ives issued a statement saying it is not negotiating with 
potential suitors. St. Ives' management owns more than half of the stock, so a 
hostile takeover bid is highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of House of Fabrics, a Sherman Oaks chain of fabric stores periodically 
termed a potential acquisition in Wall Street rumors, rose 10% in the quarter 
to $23.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Sierracin's stock rose 19% to $7.75 a share. Earlier this month, the Sylmar 
aerospace company disclosed that a group led by Chairman Christoph Tribull is 
considering buying the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aborted Takeover 
</P>
<P>
One company's stock fell because takeover plans fell through. The stock of AME, 
a Burbank video post-production company, fell 23% to $10 a share in the 
quarter. A $13.75-a-share bid launched by Chairman Andrew M. McIntyre was 
scrapped by McIntyre in February because he was unable to finance the buyout 
"on satisfactory terms." AME also ended talks last month with an unidentified 
third party that was interested in buying the company. 
</P>
<P>
Software Toolworks, a fast-growing publisher of entertainment and educational 
software for personal computers, had a big quarter as its stock rose 38% to 
$6.88 a share. The Chatsworth company, led by former network talk-show host Les 
Crane, also disclosed in the quarter that it is buying for an undisclosed 
amount DS Technologies, a software publisher in West Chicago, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, saw its stock rise 21% to $41 
a share in the quarter. Amgen's shares had risen in anticipation of Food and 
Drug Administration approval of its new anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or 
EPO. 
</P>
<P>
But approval has been delayed by a federal judge, who ordered Amgen to amend 
its application to sell EPO. The order came in a case in which Ortho 
Pharmaceutical Corp., a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, sued Amgen, 
asserting that the company broke a marketing agreement for the drug. Last week, 
Amgen said it would post a quarterly loss of up to $10 million because of 
delays in bringing EPO to market.

NEW OWNERS DOUBLE SALES, AIM FOR FURTHER GROWTH AT PACOIMA-BASED K-SWISS 
</P>

<P>
K-Swiss isn't exactly L.A. Gear. Pacoima Gear, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
From an industrial park on Montague Street on the east end of Pacoima, the 
sneaker manufacturer is trying to emerge from a pack of some two dozen 
also-rans in the sports shoe business to challenge the industry's giants -- 
Reebok, Nike and the hottest and flashiest sneaker company, L.A. Gear. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, success in sneakers has come by selling thousands of styles of 
brightly colored shoes promoted with big advertising budgets and endorsements 
from sports superstars. In addition, the companies with the biggest growth have 
sold themselves as the shoe to wear for fashion or for one kind of exercise, 
such as jogging, aerobics or playground basketball. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 20 years, K-Swiss made one basic shoe. It was popular among tennis 
buffs, but virtually unknown to most people. That's the way its founders, 
Swiss-born brothers Arthur and Ernest Bruner, wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
"The company never changed and never varied. It opened at 8 in the morning and 
closed at 4:30 in the afternoon no matter what," said Preston Davis, K-Swiss 
vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, K-Swiss was bought for more than $20 million by a group led by 
shoe industry veteran Steven Nichols, backed financially by John Hancock, the 
giant insurance company, and the Bank of New England. 
</P>
<P>
At the time K-Swiss was sold, sales had leveled at about $20 million a year. In 
the two years since Nichols took over as president, sales have more than 
doubled to $45 million. Instead of one basic shoe, K-Swiss has five styles with 
about 150 variations, mostly in color. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Nationwide 
</P>
<P>
The company is the 16th largest in the nation's $4.2 billion-a-year sports shoe 
business, according to the newsletter Sporting Goods Management News in 
Yardley, Pa. K-Swiss, for years a shoe that was primarily sold in the West, is 
now sold nationally in such chains as Foot Locker and The Athlete's Foot. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really doing quite well and are perceived by many people as one of 
the real ones to watch in the industry," said Dick Silverman, editor of 
Footwear News, the industry's main trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, K-Swiss has been getting the kind of sales push it has never received 
before. A $1-million advertising campaign, small by industry standards but big 
for K-Swiss, is under way, including full-page ads in such major circulation 
magazines as Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
The company also is trying to attract attention through low-budget, and 
sometimes offbeat, celebrity endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Signing up celebrity athletes is standard operating practice for the big sports 
shoe companies. But K-Swiss can't afford the millions of dollars asked by 
athletes with the status of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, who works for 
Nike; Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson, who runs up the court in Converse 
sneakers, or tennis wonder Steffi Graf, who wears Adidas shoes on her feet and 
the company's logo everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
K-Swiss has in its celebrity stable Los Angeles Lakers rookie David Rivers, who 
wears the company's shoes while averaging less than 10 minutes playing time a 
game as Magic Johnson's backup at point guard. Another K-Swiss celebrity is Bud 
Collins, a bald, middle-aged tennis writer for the Boston Globe and a 
television commentator who was once voted the game's worst announcer in a poll 
of fans conducted by a tennis magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that most celebrity endorsements of shoes are ineffective. Most 
people, he argues, don't know what shoes the top athletes wear, except for 
superstars such as Jordan. As a result, he said, K-Swiss is trying to be 
different by using people such as Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit of what we call guerrilla warfare. It makes you stop and 
think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Swiss Names 
</P>
<P>
K-Swiss does things differently, not the least of which is giving its shoes, 
which retail for $30 to $75 a pair, names that come from places in Switzerland, 
even though the company has as much in common with that nation as Pacoima does. 
A shoe for tennis is the "Gstaad." One for basketball is named for a Swiss 
mountain, the "Bristen," not the most intimidating, in-your-face name on the 
playground these days. 
</P>
<P>
Although K-Swiss has grown rapidly in the past two years, being No. 16 in the 
sneaker business doesn't carry much cachet. It's about as impressive as being 
the fourth largest auto maker with headquarters in the United States. In autos, 
there's the Big Three -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- and not much 
else. In sneakers, it's the Big Two. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Nike, Reebok and the 20 dwarfs," said John Horan, publisher of Sporting 
Goods Management News. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Reebok's sales were $1.8 billion, with Nike's at $1.2 billion for 
the fiscal year ended May 31. Reebok's share of the U.S. athletic footwear 
market was 27%, with Nike's at 23%, according to Sporting Goods Management 
News. A long way back is the rest of the pack, led by Converse, with about 6% 
of the market, and L.A. Gear, with about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
A longer way back is K-Swiss. Even with its strong recent showing, it holds a 
mere 1.1% of the sports shoe market. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the company hopes to join the ranks of the fast-growing challengers to 
Nike and Reebok, notably L.A. Gear and British Knights, a popular shoe among 
inner city youths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stresses Simplicity 
</P>
<P>
Nichols plans get there by keeping it simple. No need to make thousands of 
styles and colors, which often leaves stores stuck with shoes they can't sell. 
K-Swiss uses simple styles that are made using only three pieces of leather per 
shoe so there are fewer seams. 
</P>
<P>
"We come out with one model a season. We don't have to do it with fluff," 
Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Horan, the newsletter publisher, sees simplicity as one of K-Swiss' strengths. 
Consumers are being bombarded by ads for high-tech shoes with high prices that 
use various air cushions or, as a Reebok ad claims, "energy return" during 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, consumers and retailers start to glaze over it. You're not 
selling the space shuttle here. It's just sneakers," Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' simple approach says something about his personal style. He's not a 
fashion expert or flamboyant marketing whiz, but a veteran shoe dog who started 
in the business working in his grandfather's store in Brooklyn and ultimately 
operated his own chain of children's shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 45, was lured away from his stores by Stride Rite, a children's shoe 
maker based in Cambridge, Mass. He left when he bought K-Swiss from the 
Bruners, who founded the company in 1968 to import Swiss-made sporting goods 
and started manufacturing shoes in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
At K-Swiss, Nichols is borrowing some of the same approaches to manufacturing 
that companies such as Reebok, Nike and L.A. Gear have used successfully. One 
is to have a distinctive logo on its shoe that also serves as a trademark. 
Reebok has a Union Jack, while Nike has a swirl that looks like a comet. For 
K-Swiss, the look is five stripes (as opposed to three for European giant 
Adidas) and a red, white and blue shield. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Foreign Plants 
</P>
<P>
Another important move Nichols has made is to hook up with low-cost shoe 
manufacturers in Asia that can make the shoes quickly using leather from 
Argentina. The company makes some of its shoes in Pacoima, but that is quickly 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
As big as they are, Reebok and Nike don't own factories. They are essentially 
marketing companies that design shoes made under contract by manufacturers in 
Korea, Taiwan and other Far East countries. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Reebok and Nike don't cut and dye leather and don't have a 
huge manufacturing force to support. They can act quickly because their 
decisions about dropping or creating a new shoe do not have to be made based on 
how best to use aging factories. 
</P>
<P>
So what do they have? 
</P>
<P>
"They have a telephone," Nichols said. "And on the other end is Korea or 
Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' most recent introductions have been a children's line, boating shoes 
and a line of clothes. The company is putting a lot of effort toward selling 
teen-agers on its shoes, particularly at youth tennis tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Horan said that K-Swiss is close to breaking away from the also-rans and 
joining the second-tier of companies under Nike and Reebok. But to become a 
huge seller, he said, it will have to do a couple of things. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs Partner 
</P>
<P>
One, he said, is to hook up with a company with deep pockets that can act fast. 
Nike had a Japanese trading company that backed it, while Reebok had a British 
firm. He said the market moves too fast for banks and other conservative 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing K-Swiss needs, he said, is to find the kind of identity that made 
the other major companies in the sneakers business so successful. Nike was the 
shoe for joggers, Reebok rode the aerobics craze and L.A. Gear built itself by 
selling fashionable shoes worn with jeans and other casual clothing. 
</P>
<P>
If K-Swiss can find that sort of identity, he said, the company may soon be 
among the top sports shoe companies in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the company will continue to push simplicity. He believes that 
retailers are growing tired of having to pick from among thousands of styles 
and colors. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to guess every six months what is going to be hot and what is not. 
If they miss, they will have a lot of shoes that will have to be marked down. 
We believe in keeping everything as simple as possible," he said.

GROUP TRIES TO PUT A DAMPER ON SPECULATION IN SIERRACIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group led by Sierracin Corp. Chairman Christoph Tribull recently said it 
might make an offer to buy the 50% of the Sylmar aerospace-parts concern it 
does not already own. But the group did not propose a price it might pay. 
</P>
<P>
That left Wall Street to guess, and the guessing game that ensued sent 
Sierracin's stock soaring in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
Last week alone, the stock surged $4.625 a share, or 61%, to $12.25 a share on 
average daily volume of 26,900 shares, about 10 times the stock's daily average 
during March. Only two months ago, the stock sold for $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
So on Monday, as the stock continued climbing on the American Stock Exchange, 
the Tribull group tried to throw cold water on the price speculation. It 
announced that if it makes an offer, it "is considering" a price of $15 a 
share, or $25.5 million. The group also reiterated that there is no guarantee 
it will make a bid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bidding Continued 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street apparently has little doubt that a deal is coming, although it 
remains to be seen whether the group's announcement keeps a lid on the stock's 
market price. After the announcement Monday, investors continued to bid up the 
stock. It gained $1.75 a share on the day to close at $14 a share, with trading 
again heavy at 34,500 shares. 
</P>
<P>
Why indicate a price if no formal offer was ready? Tribull and other Sierracin 
executives referred all questions to an outside public-relations spokesman, who 
said the group feared "that people have an exaggerated notion of what's going 
to be paid, so they felt compelled to get the price out." 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to see the record set straight before the price got out of hand," 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly half of its shares held by management, Sierracin's stock normally 
is thinly traded. And for that reason, Sierracin is paid little heed by Wall 
Street analysts or institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Tribull, who owns 44% of Sierracin, the group studying a takeover 
includes Asahi Glass Co. of Japan, which holds 6% of the company. Sierracin, 
which makes aircraft windows, motors, coatings and seals, earned $3.11 million 
last year on sales of $82.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stockholders' Suit 
</P>
<P>
Tribull and other members of the group have declined comment on why they are 
considering a bid. But they have said an offer would be conditioned on whatever 
terms Sierracin reaches in settling a stockholders' lawsuit that was filed in 
July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by Herbert and Euretta Hastings, who own about 7.4% of 
Sierracin, accused Tribull and other company officers of fraud, mismanagement 
and use of corporate assets for personal benefit. The Hastings wanted Tribull 
ousted and a court-appointed receiver to manage Sierracin. Tribull and the 
other defendants denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sierracin asserted that the Hastings had threatened legal 
action if the company did not buy their Sierracin stock for $17.14 a share, or 
$4.25 million. The Hastings denied that charge, saying Sierracin was trying to 
divert attention from the Hastings' suit. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, no settlement had been reached with the Hastings, the Sierracin 
spokesman said. In addition, Sierracin noted that any settlement -- and 
subsequent takeover bid -- will be subject to court approval.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: BERMUDA INVESTOR RAISES HOLDINGS IN VERIT TO 7.2% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arthur Dalfen, a Bermuda investor, raised his stake in Verit Industries from 
5.5% to 7.2% of the Sun Valley company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Dalfen said he 
bought 12,900 additional Verit shares between Nov. 9 and March 27 at prices 
ranging from $4.50 to $6 a share. Dalfen, who now owns a total of 55,000 Verit 
shares, has said he is buying the stock for investment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Verit has been a manufacturer of stereo loudspeakers and a distributor of other 
electronic products. But in February, Verit announced plans to abandon those 
operations and to search for acquisitions "that may have greater potential for 
profit."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: MICHIGAN PENSION FUND TO INVEST IN AVTEK PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state pension fund in Michigan announced its intention to invest up to $12.5 
million in a new corporate airplane being developed by Avtek Corp. of 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The State of Michigan Retirement Systems Venture Capital Fund, which invests in 
new firms seen as having high growth potential, said its investment would be 
conditioned on Avtek receiving a similar-sized investment from private 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Avtek said it would build the plane in Battle Creek, Mich., if 
the plane receives the necessary Federal Aviation Administration certification. 
Avtek chose Michigan because the state agreed to help raise part of the $20 
million that Avtek needs for the various tests required by the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
Avtek's plane, a twin-engine, 6,600-pound aircraft that will cost about $1.75 
million, is made mostly of plastic-like fiber "composites" designed to make it 
lighter and less costly.

YOUR BODY: RICE BRAN MAY GIVE OAT BRAN RUN FOR MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dietary fads come and go. And, according to some scientists, oat bran may soon 
face stiff competition on grocery store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture report that rice bran -- 
found in brown rice, cereal and some breads -- lowered blood cholesterol in 
animals just as effectively as the much-touted oat bran. 
</P>
<P>
Reductions averaged 20% in rice-bran fed animals, about the same decrease found 
in the oat-bran-fed group, said Robin Saunders, a food chemist with the USDA 
Western Regional Research Center in Albany, Calif. He and other researchers 
note that human studies, expected to begin in the United States by summer, are 
needed to verify the results. 
</P>
<P>
Such human studies are already under way in other countries. In Australia, for 
example, results of a government-sponsored rice bran study, due in three 
months, appear "promising," said a spokesman for the Rice Industry of New South 
Wales. How rice bran -- the outside layer of the rice kernel -- works to lower 
cholesterol isn't understood. But scientists speculate it may have something to 
do with the oils contained in it, said John Hunnell, a food chemist with 
Riviana Foods, a rice marketer in Houston, Tex. Those oils are polyunsaturated 
and monounsaturated, not the saturated type associated with increases in 
cholesterol levels, Hunnell explained. (In oat bran, fiber is believed to lower 
cholesterol.) 
</P>
<P>
"The more sources we can find to reduce blood cholesterol, the better," said 
Peter Hoagland, a research chemist at the USDA's Eastern Regional Research 
Center in Philadelphia. "(Rice bran) gives us potential to increase variation 
in the diet." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sayre, a food chemist at the USDA's western center, noted that rice bran 
is a good source of protein, is low in sodium and has about the same amount of 
soluble fiber as oat bran. Rice bran proponents also maintain it tastes sweeter 
than oat bran and is less likely to trigger allergies. 
</P>
<P>
Even without domestic human studies, Riviana and other food companies are 
gearing up to provide more rice bran products and recipes. Until then, 
consumers can choose from a few commercially available products: brown rice 
(about 10% rice bran), rice bran cereal, (100% rice bran and often available in 
health food stores) and some multigrain breads. 
</P>
<P>
But if your aim is to lower cholesterol, forget white rice. All bran in it, 
said Hunnell, is lost during processing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Cancer Connection 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a 12-year study of more than 15,000 people from southwestern 
Scotland, low blood cholesterol levels coincided with an increased cancer risk, 
particularly in men, researchers report in the current British Medical Journal. 
</P>
<P>
As in some previous studies, an association was found between low cholesterol 
levels and cancer of the colon; in addition, the Scottish study linked low 
cholesterol with lung cancer. Some researchers speculate that low cholesterol 
may in fact be the product of undiagnosed bowel cancer, as developing tumors 
trap cholesterol and remove it from the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the mechanism, said Dr. Victor M. Hawthorne, professor of 
epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor 
and the principal investigator in the recent study. While the relationship 
between low cholesterol levels and cancer isn't understood, he believes the 
association could result when low cholesterol levels unfavorably alter the cell 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Study results should not discourage those with high cholesterol levels from 
reducing them to minimize the risk of heart disease, said Hawthorne. But "those 
with satisfactory cholesterol levels should not become overly concerned about 
reducing them further," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of heart disease begins to increase when cholesterol levels reach 200 
milligrams per deciliter, according to the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Springtime for Dieters 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's recent heat wave and health club advertisements are 
reminders that swimsuit season is fast approaching. If you decide to begin a 
diet and exercise program today, what results can reasonably be expected in the 
10 weeks before summer officially begins? Here are the opinions of two experts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Weight: With careful dieting, expect a loss of 9 to 18 pounds, suggested 
Daniel Kosich, an exercise physiologist and program director at Jane Fonda 
Workout in Beverly Hills. But Susan Johnson, director of continuing education 
for the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas disagreed, saying a loss of 5 
to 9 pounds is more realistic. "And it may be less if people are changing their 
body compositions (since lean tissue weighs more than fat tissue)." Both noted 
the loss depends on initial weight and other factors such as metabolic rate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strength: If training is done two or three times a week, expect "noticeable 
changes in physique" within four weeks, Kosich said. Gains are dependent on 
base level. "If you start from being sedentary, a 5% strength gain per week, 
particularly if you use weights, isn't unusual," Johnson noted. Those in better 
condition initially will see slower progress. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Appearance: If you are at the button-popping stage, clothes should fit 
better at the end of 10 weeks, Johnson said. But you may weigh the same, she 
added, because fat tissue has decreased and lean tissue weighs more. 
</P>
<P>
To ease the shape-up process, realize that weight loss and strength gains often 
reach a "plateau stage," said Johnson. "Often, you don't lose weight for three 
weeks and wake up the third week and three pounds are gone." Also keep in mind 
that as you increase the amount of lean tissue, more calories are burned -- 
even at rest, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Fitness and Childbirth 
</P>
<P>
Exercise during pregnancy can decrease the perception of labor pain, say 
Italian researchers reporting in the American Journal of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the University of L'Aquila compared two groups of women: 21 who 
did no exercise during pregnancy and 15 who used a stationary bicycle three 
times a week for 30 minutes. Then, using blood samples, pain perceptions were 
evaluated and measured during labor. 
</P>
<P>
In both groups, beta-endorphins -- so-called natural painkillers secreted by 
the brain -- increased during labor. But the level was higher among the women 
who had exercised; these women also reported much less intense pain than their 
non-exercising counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe any exercise program that is prescribed during pregnancy should be 
closely monitored but believe that most normal pregnant women can benefit by 
such a program of fitness conditioning," the researchers conclude. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian findings "go along with what we've found out about exercise during 
labor," said Dr. Raul Artal, a USC professor of obstetrics and gynecology, who 
notes that additional research is needed. According to several USC studies, 
exercise during labor -- such as walking -- can be valuable, he noted. They 
indicate that "'Women who exercise during labor experience less pain than women 
who don't."

ABOUT A THIRD OF THE NATION'S SENIORS EXERCISE, AND EXPERTS SAY THEY'RE ON THE 
RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Age 60 was something of a bummer for Burt DeGroot Jr., of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Back in his pole vaulting days at Stanford, he had injured his right ankle. The 
years had gone by, and now the effects of that injury were bothering him to the 
point that he had to give up his longtime conditioning program of running and 
jumping and volleyball playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dean of student activities at Santa Monica College, and I began using my 
lunch hour, instead of eating, to lift weights in the gym," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried Putting the Shot 
</P>
<P>
"That was turning out so well that when I reached age 64, my brother, who was 
track coach at Fullerton High School, suggested that I stop by and have a try 
at putting the shot and throwing the discus." 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot, now 82, is busy prepping to compete in the second biennial U.S. 
National Senior Olympics this June in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
His specialty: Shot putting and discus throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"I practice three times a week at San Clemente High School," the octogenarian 
said proudly. "I can put the shot about 28 feet, and I can throw the discus 
about 90 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Many seniors still hesitate to join the fitness craze in America, but what with 
the increasing graying of the nation, attention is turning more and more to the 
issue of what extent older people should participate in exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys, according to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 
show that only about one-third of American adults age 65 and older exercise 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits of Activity 
</P>
<P>
This is unfortunate, health experts say. "The four most common chronic 
conditions among adults age 65 and older are arthritis, hypertension, hearing 
impairments and heart disease," said a spokesman for the Council. "All but 
hearing impairment can be positively influenced by appropriate exercise." 
</P>
<P>
But those seniors who have tried intensive exercise seem to have caught the 
bug. Two years at the first Senior Olympics, about 3,000 people showed up from 
38 states to compete in swimming, archery, volleyball and other events. A 
spokesman for the Senior Olympics expects 4,000 to show up this year. 
</P>
<P>
Who better to proclaim the exercise gospel than an elderly person himself, 
78-year-old Dr. John H. Williams of Valdese, N.C., a former health educator who 
continues to practice what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
Five days a week he drives 50 miles round-trip just to swim at the YMCA in 
Conover -- about 600 yards daily at present -- in preparation for the swimming 
events at the coming Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming is ideal exercise for seniors," Williams said by phone. "There is no 
pressure on the bones, joints and tendons. An older person can harm those 
things, especially by pounding them on the pavement while running or jogging. 
</P>
<P>
"But the buoyancy of water means you can get an aerobic workout without putting 
any stress on the joints." 
</P>
<P>
Another oldster who believes in the value of swimming is 66-year-old Doris 
Peters of Imperial, Mo., also a participant in the inaugural Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about the water that is very relaxing," she said by phone. 
"If you run, you may finish exhausted. But if you swim, you finish refreshed. I 
feel like I'm a 66-year-old in the body of an 18-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a retired public health professor at Appalachian State University in 
North Carolina, member of the President's Conference on Physical Fitness and 
Aging, and author of numerous articles on the subject, also had these thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
"The body at any age is biologically meant to move; otherwise it will atrophy. 
I recall breaking my leg skiing in Germany in the 1940s. When the leg came out 
of the cast after eight weeks, it was thin as a pencil. Similarly, in the later 
years of one's life, if the body isn't used, it begins to say: 'OK, I'll just 
shrink.' " 
</P>
<P>
The retired professor pointed out the advantages that today's seniors have over 
those of decades past: "In former days, there weren't nearly as many swimming 
pools, bowling alleys, bike paths, urban walking paths." 
</P>
<P>
Octa DeLamater doesn't need those sort of facilities for her daily exercise. 
Just give her a Nerf ball to pitch or kick or toss into a basket. 
</P>
<P>
DeLamater, by the way, is 105 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to let wheelchair confinement interfere with working out, she shows up 
regularly three times a week in a room near hers at Hollenbeck Home, a 
life-care facility in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
She has a hearing problem, but activity director Betts Hall described the 
remarkable centenarian: 
</P>
<P>
"She is a physical marvel. Up until she was 101, she would lie on her back on 
the floor, and kick both her feet up over her shoulders and her head. 
</P>
<P>
"Octa would also sit in a chair in her room with weights on her ankles, and 
lift her legs. Until a couple of years ago she would walk unassisted through 
the home every day -- and keep records to see how many miles she was piling 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Exercising 
</P>
<P>
At 105, this native Kansan can only walk with assistance now, and navigates in 
a wheelchair. But this doesn't hinder her in any way from showing up thrice 
weekly for a half-hour exercise class. 
</P>
<P>
"About 15 residents participate, and they sit in wheelchairs in a circle," the 
activity director said. "Part of the time is spent tossing a ball either to a 
neighbor, or to whoever is in the center conducting the class. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually a portable basketball hoop is brought out, and they take turns 
trying to score baskets. Also, they play a form of soccer. They sit and kick a 
ball to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the others protest because Octa will stretch a leg out and try to 
get in a kick before the ball reaches the person next to her. She is still a 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, gets to the same destination via the same route. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Depew, a U.S. senator from New York at the turn of the century who 
lived to be 94, once said: "I get my exercise acting as a pallbearer to my 
friends who exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kuraner, age 80, of Sherman Oaks, seems to have the same outlook. "I've 
never done any special exercising in my life," he said. "It has gotten me this 
far, so I figure it'll get me to the end, whenever that is." 
</P>
<P>
Kuraner allowed as how he does sometimes bicycle to the bank or post office, 
but added that he does so because he doesn't like to drive anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically a lazy person," Kuraner said. "My wife wants me to walk more, 
and sometimes I do. But I never make it a habit to do so. I do nothing 
regimented. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat whatever I like. I have never done a diet. I eat eggs every day -- I 
think they are the most complete nourishment there is. I am healthy, and I 
don't see doctors much at all." 
</P>
<P>
You might say that Kuraner marches to a different drummer -- one with a slower 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bob Wiswell, an associate professor of exercise science at USC, touts the 
idea of seniors devoting part of their leisure time to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For cardiovascular endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For maintenance of muscular strength. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For mobility/flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep body fat down. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing for the older folks is that they don't have to reach 
exhaustion to benefit from exercise, Wiswell explained. "The younger get 70% to 
85% of maximum heartbeat output, the older can get the same benefit from 35% to 
45%." 
</P>
<P>
Wiswell mentioned Harry Truman's favorite exercise, walking, as something most 
seniors can do. "Walking a mile will burn off 100 calories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Options 
</P>
<P>
"Such people might also consider lawn mowing, riding either a stationary or 
moving bike, swimming, deck shuffleboard, lawn bowling, badminton, folk dancing 
-- something other than just sitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for statistical evidence should consider the remarks of Dr. 
Everett L. Smith, director of the biogerontology lab at the University of 
Wisconsin: 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the average individual loses functional capacity at the rate of 
0.75% to 1% a year after the age of 30. . . . In my opinion, about 50% of the 
average aging decline is self-induced by life style, and the other 50% is due 
to the genes or the makeup of the individual biological system." 
</P>
<P>
Although not all experts agree that an exercise program should include running, 
a recent study by the Stanford University School of Medicine seems to dispel 
the notion that the older shouldn't run, because of damage they might cause to 
their knees or hips. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford studied 41 long-distance runners between the ages of 50 and 72, and a 
comparable group of non-runners. The runners, both male and female, had 40% 
more bone material than the non-runners, but showed no significant differences 
in the onset of joint disease or osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Walking, according to gerontologists, is by far the most popular exercise 
activity for people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Place, as have some other Southland shopping malls, has begun a 
program to encourage it. Theirs is called Sea Strutters. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is offered from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Monday, Wednesday, 
Friday," explained Liz Von der Heide of the marketing department. "Walking the 
full length of each of our three levels equals one mile." 
</P>
<P>
Jean and Donald Cotner of San Juan Capistrano do their daily walking at Dana 
Point Harbor. By now they are used to the wisecracks: "Is somebody chasing 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old wife and the 66-year-old husband are both rapid walking buffs. 
So good have they become in their few months at it that they have won prizes in 
three competitions, and will strive in the coming national Senior Olympics -- 
in the 5-K race walking event. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of started by accident," Donald Cotner said. "I had taken up running 
at age 63, and was competing in events for seniors. Two years ago we went to 
Melbourne (Australia) where I was entered for an event. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down with the flu. Had gone all that way, and didn't even get to 
participate in the parade. I was so disappointed I decided the heck with run 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going Faster 
</P>
<P>
When the Cotners returned home, they did a little recreational walking at Dana 
Point, and in due time they noticed something: They seemed to be walking faster 
than most of the other pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Which led to race walking. "It's great for the cardiovascular system," Jean 
Cotner said. "Gets your pulse up, and keeps your body moving. 
</P>
<P>
"I still like swimming and bicycling, but walking can be done anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, as she has for 21 years, Jean Cotner teaches yoga classes. "Some 
of my students are seniors. It's a safe way to keep the body flexible and in 
tune." 
</P>
<P>
As for the couple's fast walking, they do about four miles together daily, four 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The senior circuit.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE GOLDWYN AGE; 
</P>
<P>
BOOK PARTY PROVIDES A PEEK AT NEW HOLLYWOOD EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood's Golden Age -- make that Hollywood's Goldwyn age -- was remembered 
Sunday night at a reception at the Frances Howard Goldwyn library in Hollywood. 
The party celebrated the publication of the new book "Goldwyn," by Los Angeles 
author Scott Berg, as well as the imminent re-release of Goldwyn's classic film 
"Wuthering Heights" on its 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd were Charlton Heston, Dorothy Lamour, Karl Malden, Wallis 
Annenberg, Tom Bradley, Judith Krantz, Jane Wyatt, members of the Goldwyn 
family, and Roddy McDowall, who told Berg, "Your book really captured a 
wonderful time. I don't know how anyone survived it." 
</P>
<P>
Also there were seven of the original "Goldwyn Girls," actresses who got their 
start in Goldwyn films. Lucille Ball, perhaps the most famous of them all, 
wasn't there, but Virginia Mayo made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Goldwyn," published by Alfred A. Knopf, chronicles the history of the studio 
founded by the legendary Samuel Goldwyn. Asked about the difference between 
Hollywood then and now, Berg was succinct. "Cynicism," he said. "There is a 
bottom-line mentality these days, because the studios are run by conglomerates. 
Back then, it was six small shops, run by men who were certainly interested in 
making money, but who were also acutely aware that their names were attached to 
the films." 
</P>
<P>
Guests also got a look at the library's new exhibit, "The Goldwyn Age of 
Hollywood," which will be open to the public through July 8. Photos, letters, 
telegrams, and contracts are on display on both floors of the library with 
commentary from Berg's book. Much of the material dates to the teens, when 
immigrant Goldwyn was still fresh in the United States from a small town near 
Warsaw, and he bore the name Samuel Goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
Party-goers snacked from a light buffet (guests were camped out in front of a 
mousse made from layers of sour cream, guacamole, and caviar) and wended their 
way through press and camera crews from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. commissioned Berg to do the book, and he seemed impressed 
with both the finished product and the interest that his father still commands. 
Asked if there were any surprises in the book, which entailed eight years of 
research and considerable riffling of the studio's files, Goldwyn said, "He had 
told me that he had come to the U.S. through Ellis Island and fallen to his 
knees in front of the Statue of Liberty. When I read the book, I found out that 
he actually came into the country through Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Goldwyn didn't have control over the writing of the book. "But I'm pleased with 
the reaction," he said, "which is that this is an honest book. It's a picture 
of a man who is very much a formative figure in Hollywood history, and it's a 
portrait of survival. Sure, there are things that I'm kind of ambivalent 
about." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged and smiled. "But that's what happens in Hollywood," he added, "when 
you don't get final cut."

THE 'ART' OF SPURRING WORKER CREATIVITY;

<P>
AEROJET COLLECTION TO BE MISSED BY MOST

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executive secretary Elaine Alvillar is facing a divorce from what she calls "my 
absolute favorite thing," a tall, green-hued, partly abstract watercolor titled 
"February Fish," by Joseph Raffael. It graces the wall next to her desk. 
</P>
<P>
Executive secretary Sue Harrington soon will bid adieu to contemporary artist 
Kenneth Noland's "Diagonal Stripes." 
</P>
<P>
"I go for the muted colors, the greens and blues," Harrington said of the 
geometric painting a few feet from her desk. "They're soothing." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's and Alvillar's employer, Aerojet, a defense contractor that 
specializes in aerospace products, announced plans last week to move its La 
Jolla headquarters to Sacramento. As part of the move, the company will sell 
the impressive contemporary art collection that adorns the Aerojet offices and 
hallways. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet executives say they hope to sell the entire collection to a developer 
who will keep the artwork in San Diego. A Centre City Development Corp. 
requirement that builders in redevelopment districts allocate some of their 
building costs to art could be covered with one-stop shopping at Aerojet. 
Otherwise, the collection will be auctioned off piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 216 paintings, lithographs and sculptures is superior work by Robert 
Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Robert Motherwell, and local artists such as 
Russell Forester and Robin Bright. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the strongest corporate collection in San Diego," said Hugh 
Davies, director of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. "And as an example 
of art in the work place, I would say that Aeroject and Scripps Clinic 
represent the two best examples in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Davies described Aerojet's move and the dispersal of the art collection as 
"demoralizing," but not crippling. "Other corporations have collections here 
and new ones are forming (collections) all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Aerojet employees recognize that the company move and art collection sale 
are part of a cost-reduction plan, some will sorely miss the artworks that have 
played an intangible role in their work. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a mixture of it here, it's like being in a museum," said 
executive secretary Monica Seyfnarimani. "There's a lot of individuality, a lot 
of moods. You can tell that each piece is a mood the artist is representing. I 
feel that way, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Seyfnarimani particularly enjoys British artist Richard Smith's muted red 
acrylic on canvas, "Manhattan No. 1," which reminds her of sailboats and kites 
more than city office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ochs, director of manufacturing technology, would "give my eye teeth" 
for the Raffael. Since coming to Aerojet nine year's ago as an engineer, Ochs's 
art appreciation has grown from representational art to include some abstract 
pieces. He and his wife have collected several works for their home, including 
a piece by Joan Miro. 
</P>
<P>
But Ochs does not like everything in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I really am intrigued and appreciative of perhaps 25% of the pieces in the 
collection," Ochs said. "I like 40%. The other 60%, I say well, those are the 
odds." 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet's contemporary art collection grew out of management's desire to 
reflect the company's high-tech role in the aerospace industry. When Aerojet 
moved its corporate headquarters to La Jolla from El Monte in 1979, executives 
commissioned La Jolla architect Howard Oxley to design a modern office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Oxley responded to the Torrey Pines Road environment with a "transparent" 
design for a three-story building, featuring a clear glass "curtain wall" 
facade, redwood and unpainted concrete and brick. The structure commands 
impressive views of the Pacific Ocean and the Torrey Pines golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has produced engines for Titan rockets, Gemini missiles and 
the space shuttle, decided to decorate the new headquarters with contemporary 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet executives said that they used contemporary art years ago as a decor 
with the hope of stimulating employees' creativity. The company sponsored an 
educational program at the La Jolla facility on the art and the artists, 
including after-hours lectures for employees and their spouses. But not every 
employee was won over or will miss the collection when it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Omer Ruiz, director of contracts with customer firms, acknowledges his lack of 
affection for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the category of people who can't stand the art," Ruiz said 
recently. "But I have to put myself in the category of not appreciating it. I 
don't have any sense of inspiration or identity or 'lifting' by virtue of this 
particular art." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Strode, Aerojet director of government finance relations, said he has "a 
tough time understanding and appreciating" the art. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get together to talk about the art, and somebody mentions a piece he 
likes or dislikes, I won't even remember it, even though I probably see it 
every day," Strode said. 
</P>
<P>
A sports fan, Strode prefers representational art, like the forest scene 
watercolor on his office wall. "If you put a few Leroy Neimans in front of me, 
I'll know what you're talking about," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Ochs, however, thinks "it's exceedingly unfortunate" that the company is 
selling the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been to a number of shows and collections and I have never seen a 
contemporary art collection in one place that has the scope and diversity of 
this one," Ochs said. "We're losing a tremendous asset. It has given a level of 
dignity to this office complex that will be hard to arrive at in any other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
However, the times have changed, and Aerojet's new president has declared that 
the company must cut costs to remain competitive, Sprague said. Aerojet plans 
to vacate its modern La Jolla building in August or September to move to a more 
traditional structure it owns in the Sacramento area, where more than half its 
8,000 employees work. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was, 'Let's make a change if we're moving to a new building,' " 
Sprague said. "Let's start afresh. The reason to sell (the art) was also to 
make a statement that this is a new outfit." 
</P>
<P>
The Aerojet collection was recently appraised, with pieces ranging in value 
from "hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars," Sprague said. He said the 
company may donate something to a local art institution as well as give Aerojet 
employees a chance to buy art pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Working around contemporary art objects has had a surprising effect on 
secretary Alvillar, who on a recent weekend bought an art work for her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually bought something modern," Alvillar said, "and I thought, 'Hmm, this 
is like the art we have at Aerojet.' "

HUSBAND ACCUSED IN PROSTITUTE SLAYINGS; 
</P>
<P>
DEPUTY'S WIFE CLAIMS HARASSMENT BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The wife of Rickey Ross, the L.A. County sheriff's deputy accused of murdering 
three South-Central prostitutes, complained Monday that investigators have been 
conducting a campaign of harassment against the family. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Ross also said she believes that her husband is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with The Times, she said that officers repeatedly have 
staked out the Ross home, shining flashlights in her face when she returned at 
night from visiting her husband at the Los Angeles County Jail. Other officers, 
she said, have followed a pattern of telephone harassment, calling the house on 
numerous occasions to try to speak to her son -- even after being told he did 
not want to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, she said, LAPD officers threatened to beat her 21-year-old son, 
Tony, unless he posed for a photograph while officers searched their Rialto 
home. Tony Ross could be a witness, but is not considered a suspect in the 
case, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Hodgman, who is prosecuting Ross. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been watching us and harassing us ever since this case has been going 
on," Sylvia Ross said. "We don't know why. We haven't done anything. . . . Why 
are they still harassing my family? Give us a break here, this is America." 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD's chief spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, denied the accusations and 
said officers had served a search warrant on the Ross' San Bernardino County 
home Friday without incident. 
</P>
<P>
He said the search turned up eight firearms that Ross had confiscated in the 
line of duty, but failed to properly turn in to the department. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was arrested on Feb. 23 when his county car was stopped by officers on a 
South-Central street. The 40-year-old deputy, a narcotics investigator who had 
18 years with the department, allegedly had been smoking cocaine in the company 
of a prostitute when detained. 
</P>
<P>
Two guns were found in the trunk of Ross' car. Police ballistics experts said 
they tied one of the weapons to the murders of three prostitutes. The second 
gun was not connected to any crimes, officials said. A preliminary hearing is 
scheduled April 28 for Ross. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leave of Absence 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest, Sylvia Ross said, she has taken a leave of absence from her 
job as an airline flight attendant and spends most of her time working in the 
yard of the couple's home and visiting Ross in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is not guilty," she said. "He will be proven not guilty. I stand 
behind him 100%, and I love him dearly. My husband is a good person. My husband 
didn't do these things." 
</P>
<P>
Of the allegation of additional guns found at the house Friday, she said: "It's 
not true. The truth will come out later." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Ross said officers have been trying to interview her son and her 
brother, whom she declined to name. Family lawyers have advised both men that 
they do not need to answer investigators' questions. 
</P>
<P>
About 9 a.m. Friday, LAPD officers, Los Angeles sheriff's deputies and a deputy 
from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department arrived at the Ross home 
with a search warrant for guns, Sylvia Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the officers were upstairs, she said she was ordered to remain 
downstairs with a deputy. A short time later, her son came down and was 
confronted by two LAPD officers, according to both Sylvia and Tony Ross. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Request Refused, He Says 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ross said one of the officers wanted to question him. Because family 
lawyers had said he did not have to answer police questions, Ross said he 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, whose full name is unknown, replied ' "Fine, we're going to take a 
picture of you,' " Ross said. Another officer then "grabbed me by my wrist (and 
said) 'We can either make this easy or make this hard. I could beat your ass or 
(you can) be still and I'll take the picture.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he allowed the picture to be taken because he feared the officer 
would beat him. 
</P>
<P>
According to police spokesman Booth, "While we were there, we did photograph a 
young man who was there, but (there were) no beatings, no threats of beatings, 
no confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Booth refused to say why investigators wanted to take the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Sylvia Ross' accusations about harassment, Booth said: "Step by 
step, I can't re-create every word, every conversation. If Mrs. Ross has made a 
complaint to anyone, I'm not aware of it. I think a lot of us have some feeling 
for the amount of stress that Mrs. Ross must be feeling right now. I don't want 
to hammer on her at all."

THESE PROTESTERS DO THEIR HOMEWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
They started off the morning singing the unofficial anthem of black Africa, but 
by noon had switched to tunes by the Sex Pistols. One student was willing to 
get arrested -- if she could be sprung from jail in time for swim practice. And 
others were resigned to interrupting their civil disobedience to complete 
homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
So it went Monday at the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills, where more 
than 40 junior high, senior high and college students staged a sit-in to 
protest that country's policy of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of demonstrations by the Los Angeles Student 
Coalition. The county-wide group started last year with less than a dozen 
students who met at a rally on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and has grown 
to include youths from more than 50 Los Angeles schools, according to member 
Becky Winter. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, whose ages ranged from 13 to 19, arrived at the consulate at 8 
a.m., determined to prevent the office from conducting business. The consulate 
is on the third floor of a large office building near the corner of La Cienega 
and Wilshire boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot 35 students can do to bring down the system of apartheid," 
said 17-year-old Winter, a Hamilton High School student who, like many of the 
protesters, was on spring break. "But what we can do is raise consciousness, 
show that people care, and help move toward the goal of getting the consulate 
of out Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The sit-in is scheduled to last until Friday, if the students are not arrested 
first. During the first day, the group managed to turn away at least four 
people who arrived to do business at the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
The students' prowess in protesting appeared to have come a long way from their 
first rally last March, when they planned a sit-in at the consulate only to 
find that the building's managers had locked the doors by noon. 
</P>
<P>
This time they came prepared, armed with toothbrushes, jugs of water and 
detailed knowledge of the consulate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been planning this for months," said Gan Golan, 15. "We've been here 
before, scouting out the area, seeing where the stairwells are and the 
elevators. (And) we decided no one should bring more than what they could carry 
in a backpack." 
</P>
<P>
The students came equipped with two walkie-talkies, allowing those at the 
consulate's main doors to communicate with others blocking the back entrance. 
And they had developed emergency measures in the event restrooms in the hallway 
leading to the consulate were locked, a plan which involved two pails, a 
shovel, a sheet for privacy, and lots of cat litter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got . . . like 20 or 30 pounds," said Stefanie Bland, a 14-year-old 
protester. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't needed. Building management elected to unlock the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The students spent the morning chanting "Amandla Ngawetu," a phrase voiced by 
black South African protesters and which translates loosely into "power to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
All of the protesters, according to some of their members, had received 
parental permission to take part in the sit-in -- and to get arrested. One 
parent was there to monitor the activities; other parents dropped by during the 
day to bring food and lend moral support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mundane Matters in Mind 
</P>
<P>
Though seemingly sincere, the students did not allow the protest to eclipse 
wholly their everyday concerns. 
</P>
<P>
As the hallway grew hotter, and the hours longer, conversation about apartheid 
and American sanctions gave way to such topics as the changing musical sound of 
the rock group Siouxsie and the Banshees and the demise of the Sex Pistols, the 
seminal English punk rock band. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Figueroa, 17, who attends North Hollywood High School, said that while 
she was willing to face arrest for the cause, "I have to leave tonight, because 
I have swim practice tomorrow and if I miss it, I'm off the team." 
</P>
<P>
Other students studied textbooks and took naps while waiting in vain for a move 
by the dozen police officers who stood outside the building. By 5 p.m. Monday, 
the police had made no arrests. And Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert P. Curtis 
said none was planned through the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Consular officials declined comment on the protest.

SANTA MONICA -- MORE VIOLENCE DRIFTS INTO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica, an oceanfront community that has been attracting economic 
extremes -- the affluent and the down and out -- has suffered two more 
incidents of violence committed by drifters. 
</P>
<P>
A mental health professional was stabbed by a transient on Sunday and, hours 
later, a transient strolled up behind a homeless person sitting on a bench in 
the city's Palisades Park and clubbed him with a steel rod. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims survived the unrelated attacks, which followed by less than two 
months the fatal stabbing of a psychiatric social worker by a transient in the 
beach city. 
</P>
<P>
The latest violence underscored the growing pains of a city that is 
increasingly viewed as a great place to hang your hat -- whether in an 
expensive piece of real estate, or on a park bench. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Santa Monica's 156-officer police force has its hands full. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James Keane on Monday attempted to explain why there has been a 
big increase in the number of drifters walking the beach city's streets in 
recent years and -- most important -- their effect on the area's crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Monica is at the end of a freeway," he said. "You can't go any farther 
west. It's got a beautiful climate. If I was a transient, here's where I'd be." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by Keane's staff found that, since 1985, transients have been 
playing a much more significant role in violent crime in the upscale community. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of Sunday's attacks, police said, a drifter identified as Larry 
Anthony Taylor stabbed a psychiatric social worker while she was counseling him 
in a private care center. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Ann Sauerwein, 44, was able to fend off her attacker, who then fled. 
She was in good condition Monday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 27, who was arrested shortly after the attack while walking along 
Pacific Coast Highway, was booked for investigation of attempted murder and 
could be arraigned today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In a striking parallel in February, a mentally ill drifter stabbed to death 
psychiatric social worker Robbyn Panich, 36, as she worked in a county health 
clinic in Santa Monica. Her death prompted the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to approve $250,000 for beefed-up security at county outpatient 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Roback, a senior social worker at Panich's clinic, said Monday that a 
new security guard was patrolling the Santa Monica West Mental Health Center as 
a result of the supervisors' action. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing of Sauerwein, who briefly worked at the center, "stirred up" 
apprehensive feelings among workers there, who were still attempting to get 
over the Panich slaying, Roback said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Panich, however, Sauerwein, who worked for the adoptions division of the 
county Department of Children's Services, was moonlighting as a counselor for 
Devonshire House, a private center on 4th Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Violent Incident 
</P>
<P>
In her current post with the county, Sauerwein can free-lance 24 hours a week, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Further amplifying Santa Monica's growing homeless problem was another violent 
incident in the city on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported that Willy Eugene Brown, 35, whom they identified as a drifter, 
was sitting on a bench in Palisades Park overlooking the ocean when another 
drifter, Joe Alvarez, 64, walked up behind him and struck Brown with a steel 
rod. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was treated at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center for a skull injury 
and a broken arm. Alvarez, police said, was booked for investigation of assault 
with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Such violence is symptomatic of the increasing incidence of transients in the 
city's crime rate, police spokesman Sgt. John Miehle said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he said, transients accounted for 15% of the city's aggravated assault 
crimes; last year, the figure was 20%. In that same time, he said, the 
percentage of drifters charged with rape has risen from 6% to 38%, and 
homicides from 11% to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Keane said that, in his opinion, "90% of the transient problem is 
a social problem, not a police problem." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, his officers have their hands full with the growing number of 
drifters. 
</P>
<P>
"I get more complaints on transients than anything else," said Keane, 57, who 
has been the city's police chief for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has directed his officers to cite drifters, when warranted, for such 
infractions as panhandling. But he complained that the Santa Monica city 
attorney's office does not follow through on prosecuting such cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Explained 
</P>
<P>
In response, Assistant City Atty. Joseph Lawrence said his office's policy is, 
in effect, to not prosecute unless there is "a threat of violence." 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we did prosecute," Lawrence said, "the chances are that the (judges) 
would not give jail time" because of jail crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the city operates "a social work diversion program" through 
which the homeless are placed in contact with social workers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNSHOTS DISABLE DEPUTIES' PATROL CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two sheriff's deputies were unhurt when gunfire hit their patrol car and 
disabled the vehicle on a street in the Athens area of South Los Angeles early 
Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies Ralph Nishihira and Jeff Shrout were headed west on Century Boulevard 
about 1:25 a.m. when they heard a muffled shot and then the sound of breaking 
glass, Deputy Pat Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
When the deputies "heard a louder, second shot," a red Toyota Celica pulled up 
next to their patrol car and the two men inside "stated they were being shot 
at," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The Toyota sped off and the deputies' radio car suddenly stalled and died, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the deputies got out to search for the cause of the vehicle trouble, they 
discovered the patrol car had been hit by the gunfire," Hunter said. The 
bullet, which struck the car's left rear quarter panel, may have severed a fuel 
line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication the deputies were the intended target," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies cordoned off the area and searched for the gunman, but no arrests were 
made. The Toyota had not been found, Hunter said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-SCHOOL OFFICIAL SENTENCED FOR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Lynwood Unified School District official Monday was placed on three 
years' probation and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service for 
using on-duty school employees to work on his private property. 
</P>
<P>
Commodore F. Reid, 53, was also ordered by Superior Court Judge J. D. Smith to 
make restitution once it is determined how much money was lost. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Herb Lapin said the amount is probably between $2,000 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, who was director of maintenance, operations and transportation for the 
district, pleaded no contest March 7 to one count each of grand theft and 
receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Lapin said Reid agreed to pay employees to do the work on his house and some 
rental property, then reimbursed them at district expense through such means as 
compensatory time off. 
</P>
<P>
A restitution hearing is scheduled for April 24.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 85% IN POLL OPPOSE GRADUATION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of graduating students polled last week at Cal State 
Northridge oppose plans for this year's graduation at the Hollywood Bowl, 
organizers of the student-run survey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the 922 students who responded to the survey also said they want 
to bring from four to nine guests, instead of the three guests tentatively 
allowed by the university, said poll organizer Anthony Ashhurst, an Associated 
Students graduate senator. 
</P>
<P>
The university decided to hold the graduation in the bowl because the campus 
area usually used for the ceremony has been closed for construction. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,650 degrees will be awarded at the May 26 graduation, university 
spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said.

RECORD INDUSTRY, RADIO DEEJAYS AT ODDS OVER SONG IDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"When you play it, say it!" 
</P>
<P>
That's the current rallying cry in the record industry. And if it's not exactly 
"Hell no, we won't go," the cause it represents has drawn battle lines between 
the record industry and the radio world. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is "back announcing" -- the practice of telling radio listeners what 
songs and performers they have just heard. With uninterrupted and unannounced 
sets of music -- called sweeps -- becoming more common on radio, record 
companies and retailers have launched an aggressive campaign, including putting 
"play it/say it" stickers on records sent to stations and petition drives in 
record stores. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work in a record store and someone comes in and starts humming 
something and you're supposed to guess what it is, that's frustrating," said 
Carl Rosenbaum, president of Flip Side Records, which operates 17 retail 
outlets in the Chicago area. In December and January more than 10,000 
signatures were collected in Flip Side stores on petitions calling for more 
back-announcing of songs. Rosenbaum presented the petitions to the program 
director of Chicago station WYTZ-FM, which calls itself Z95. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of radio's responsibility," said Rosenbaum. "If they're playing 
the music, they should be proud enough to say it." 
</P>
<P>
Some radio programmers, though, object to the pressure tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's fair, and I'm not sure it's entirely relevant," said 
Steve Rivers, program director of Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM, often a 
target of charges that its lengthy "uninterrupted" stretches of music leave the 
listener uninformed about the songs. 
</P>
<P>
"This campaign got started maybe because the record industry was having trouble 
selling new music," Rivers said. "So they pointed the finger at radio: 'Those 
gosh darn 10-in-a-row sweeps!' Well, usually within a sweep most of the songs 
are hits, and we think it insults the audience if every time we played a 
Madonna song we said it was Madonna. You have to give the audience more credit 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
Rivers also said that his listeners prefer the momentum of the sweeps, which he 
said would be broken up by song announcements. 
</P>
<P>
But "play it/say it" campaigners say the sweeps are often interrupted by spots 
touting the uninterrupted music. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't it be better to say, 'This is Martika, part of 10 in a row on KXXX,' 
than just drop in a music bite saying it's 10 in a row?" said Kid Leo, who last 
year became vice president of artist development for Columbia Records after 15 
years as a deejay and later program director at Cleveland station WMMS-FM. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mike Schaefer, senior editor of Hitmakers magazine, a San Fernando 
Valley-based radio trade magazine that has devoted much space recently to the 
topic: "Some of the top stations, the key players are the ones not playing by 
the rules. . . . In many instances when they talk it's about a station 
promotion and they totally ignore the music." 
</P>
<P>
The debate officially started a year ago with a Billboard magazine commentary 
by Don Ienner, then executive vice president and general manager of Arista 
Records and currently president of Columbia Records. In the piece, Ienner 
called the lack of song announcing a music industry "virus." 
</P>
<P>
Since then the issue has snowballed, with the record side claiming radio has 
lost touch with its listeners and doesn't respect the music it relies on, while 
radio counters that the record industry is looking for free advertising, and 
that if it wants more mentions of its product, it should pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
It's been the hot topic at recent industry conventions and in the trade 
magazines, and the Recording Industry Assn. of America and the National Assn. 
of Record Merchandisers have banded together to declare April "Back-Announcing 
Month." During the month, petition drives will be held, and in some instances 
record buyers will be asked to call stations to demand song announcements. 
</P>
<P>
As fuel for the campaign, the record industry points to a survey conducted last 
year by the Street Pulse Group, a New Milford, Conn.-based market research 
firm. The study showed that a large majority of Top 40 radio listeners want 
radio to provide more identification of songs and more information about new 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
But many radio programmers argue with the results. "We do that kind of research 
and to be quite honest, song identification is not quite as high on the 
priority list of 
</P>
<P>
listeners as other items," KIIS's Steve Rivers said. "People want a lot of 
music, so that's why we do the sweeps." 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Shalett, who directed the Street Pulse survey, rejects Rivers' claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess somebody's not telling the truth, and I know our research does," he 
said, citing several radio programmers and consultants who have supported his 
findings. "Radio is saying 'We do a good job,' but our study showed that 
listeners said they don't. Radio's got a misconception that they're satisfying 
needs. . . . I challenge any radio programmer who says that in their 
quantitative research people do not say they want songs announced more." 
</P>
<P>
Still, no radio programmer surveyed by The Times admitted to doing a 
less-than-adequate job of announcing titles, though some said that other 
stations fail in that area. But some programmers are looking for ways to 
cooperate with the "play it/say it" effort. Brian Kelly, program director of 
Chicago's Z95, actually greeted Rosenbaum's petitions with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they came to us first," he said, claiming that his station already 
did better than most at identifying songs. "It was a painless exchange of some 
good ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The result of the meeting was that Kelly agreed to emphasize back-announcing of 
all new songs for a trial six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
And Garry Wall, program director of San Diego's KKLQ (Q106), has started an 
effort to devise innovative ways for record companies, retailers and radio 
stations to join in aggressively promoting new music. 
</P>
<P>
"We're each others' golden goose," he said. "Without their product, we wouldn't 
have a business. And without the exposure we give they wouldn't have a 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wall suggests that there is only so much radio can do. 
</P>
<P>
"We say our call letters every doggone time we can, and still there are people 
who don't even know what station they're listening to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concurred KIIS's Rivers: "Radio by the nature of it is a passive pastime. 
People listen to it and even if they really love the station they're not going 
to pay attention to it the way (industry insiders) do. They probably hear the 
name of songs announced and still can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Still, campaigners believe that public demands will be impossible for radio to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what I think is going to happen," said Shalett. "Radio stations 
like to place themselves as being better than the competition. Someone's going 
to position themselves as 'the station that tells you what it plays.' That will 
be the hip thing for stations to say."

BRITISH, U.S. TV PRODUCERS FORGING ATLANTIC ALLIANCE

<P>
In their attempts to bolster ratings, American television officials are looking 
to Britain with new fervor. Just last month, top CBS programming executives 
Howard Stringer, Kim LeMasters and Barbara Corday were meeting with their BBC 
counterparts here to discuss possible co-productions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking to CBS in general terms," said Mark Shivas, head of drama and 
TV serials for the BBC. "There's a long-standing relationship between us and 
Howard Stringer (president of the CBS Broadcast Group) that goes back many 
years." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, low-rated CBS may need the BBC more than the BBC needs CBS. But 
the balance is beginning to shift. Rising costs have prompted British 
broadcasters to look more favorably on accepting money and creative input from 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no long-running series planned for which we need major co-production 
money," Shivas says, "but I can see it in the future because of rising prices. 
There are ways of doing series co-productions, and we will find them. First we 
need a project we all like." 
</P>
<P>
The British have sold series formats to the United States before -- including 
the premises for "Three's Company," "All in the Family" and this season's "Dear 
John" -- and the number of TV movie and miniseries co-production deals between 
British and American broadcasters has vastly increased in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Successful series co-ventures have proved elusive, however. Nevertheless, both 
sides are now examining ways to collaborate on episodic programming. CBS, whose 
executives declined to comment on the recent meetings with the BBC, has already 
commissioned a pilot for an action-adventure series called "Outpost," a 
co-production between Columbia Pictures TV and HTV, one of Britain's commercial 
channels, to be shot in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
American producers are also looking to Canada, Australia and France for 
co-financing. Both ABC's "Mission: Impossible" and CBS' "Dolphin Cove" this 
season were Paramount co-productions with Australia's Network Nine. And cable's 
USA Network has two co-production series currently filming: "The Hitchhiker" 
(with a French partner, Atlantique) and "The Ray Bradbury Theater" (with 
England's Granada TV and France's Ellipse). 
</P>
<P>
"The gap between the licensing fee provided by the network and the actual 
production costs has widened over the years both here and in America," 
explained Sydney Perry, managing director of London Weekend Television 
International, "so we all need to find partners to bridge that gap." 
</P>
<P>
Satisfying two different cultures is not easy, however, as ABC discovered with 
its recently canceled series "A Fine Romance." A co-production between 
IndieProd/Phoenix/New World Television, London Weekend Television and France's 
TF-1, the one-hour romantic comedy bombed opposite "The Cosby Show' and "A 
Different World." 
</P>
<P>
"If there were any problems with the show, they weren't because of the 
co-production arrangement," said Ed Gradinger, president and chief executive 
officer of New World TV Group which put up the lion's share of the financing 
and retained creative control of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"We had terrific partners, and they made very few demands. We sent them copies 
of the scripts, and they didn't try to get in our way. They helped finance the 
show, which made life easier. You have to admit the show had phenomenal 
production values." 
</P>
<P>
"A Fine Romance," about a divorced couple who co-host a TV travel show, starred 
Margaret Whitton (American) and Christopher Cazenove (British). 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? Nick Elliott, controller of drama at London Weekend 
Television, said: "At the end of the day, a lot of shows are just not good 
enough. On this one, we never got right all the things you have to get right. 
It didn't have a single strong writer-producer at the center. I don't think the 
three partners caused the problem." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Elliott admitted, "The best way to make a series is to do it 
yourself, without partners. With partners, there are endless phone calls. But 
today, no TV company can afford to make all its major drama without a partner 
of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
"A Fine Romance" was London Weekend Television's second stab at a series 
co-produced with an American partner. The first, the 1984 police series 
"Dempsey and Makepeace," starring Michael Brandon and Glynis Barber, was 
syndicated in the United States by Tribune Entertainment, which had a minority 
stake in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can consult daily with a minority partner," said Elliott, 
who did not enjoy being in the minority position on "A Fine Romance." 
</P>
<P>
London Weekend Television will be the majority partner in its next two 
co-productions -- a series of "The Saint" movies (with D.L. Taffner) and a 
series of movies based on stories written by Frederick Forsyth (with Blair 
Entertainment/USA Network). 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get involved with a co-production series if the deal looks good and the 
show looks good," Elliott said. "It's very, very hard to do a co-production 
series. The differences between two countries are harder to satisfy on a 
long-term basis." 
</P>
<P>
New World's Gradinger has the same concerns. Co-productions, he cautions, 
cannot be "thewave of the future", but they can be "a way to do certain shows 
that can fit within the requirements of some of our sister countries." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll pay particular attention to co-productions when the product is 
suitable," he said, "You can't take an all-American show like 'Hunter' and make 
it into a co-production."

CRITIC AT LARGE: KRIGE CAREER TAKES A CONSPICUOUS TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some first film appearances are more memorable than others. In 1981, a 
then-unknown actress named Alice Krige played a beguiling young musical comedy 
star who won the heart of Ben Cross in "Chariots of Fire." She was central to 
the youthful verve and optimism of that remarkable movie, a career-launching 
portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be her most conspicuous and testing role since "Chariots of Fire," 
Krige plays a widow with two young children who marries Jeff Bridges in "See 
You in the Morning," Alan Pakula's study of family ties -- tangled, untangled, 
retied -- which opens here April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Krige is a 34-year-old South African who attended Rhodes University, intending 
to become a psychologist. One term she took an elective course in acting and 
soon decided to rethink the whole matter of career. 
</P>
<P>
Her supportive family sent her off to the Central School of Drama in London, 
whose alumni include Vanessa Redgrave and Ian Holm, her co-star in "Chariots of 
Fire" and the spy going back into the cold in the present PBS series "Game, 
Set, Match." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1979, she played Lucie Manett in a BBC production of "A 
Tale of Two Cities." One of her colleagues from Central had gone on to help 
with the casting on "Chariots" and recommended Krige to producer David Puttnam 
and director Hugh Hudson. The value of an education was never clearer. 
</P>
<P>
Her success in the film led to her first miniseries, "Ellis Island," in which 
she played an Irish lass, co-starring with Faye Dunaway and Richard Burton 
(with whom, to her regret, she had no scenes). 
</P>
<P>
She made her first American film, "Ghost Story," which was also released in 
1981 and in which she appeared with Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, Fred 
Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Patricia Neal. 
</P>
<P>
The company (enchanting, she says) spent a month at the Gideon Putnam hotel in 
Saratoga, N.Y., in zero-degree weather but waiting much of the time for some 
necessary but nonexistent snow. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing the usual pattern, Krige temporarily abandoned the promising movie-TV 
career to join the Royal Shakespeare Company where she won a best newcomer 
award from the London critics for her role in the RSC revival of Shaw's "Arms 
and the Man." 
</P>
<P>
"I learned more at the RSC, trying to reach audiences of 1,500, than I ever had 
before," Krige said. "I realized how little I knew or understood about acting 
-- realized I was only at the beginning of a process of learning that never 
stops." 
</P>
<P>
She hadn't intended to become an actress, although she had trained as a ballet 
dancer before she went to the university. Even when the idea of acting became 
more absorbing, she says, "I didn't think I could do it. I still haven't made 
up my mind about that." 
</P>
<P>
But she has continued to find important roles. In "Barfly" she was an up-market 
literary editor who falls under the spell of Mickey Rourke as the down-market 
poet. She was Bathsheba to Richard Gere's King David in the film of the same 
name, and Vanessa Redgrave's fiancee before the sex-change operation in "Second 
Serve" on television. She did "Wallenberg" opposite Richard Chamberlain for 
television and recently played Mary Shelley in the film, "Haunted Summer." 
</P>
<P>
"See You in the Morning" was a unique experience because of the extended 
rehearsal time that Pakula, who wrote and directed, spent with his cast. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived and rehearsed in the house (where much of the shooting was later 
done) for 3 1/2 weeks. I cooked in the kitchen. We slept on the set. We made it 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
Pakula and the cast, which also included Farrah Fawcett, David Dukes and 
Frances Sternhagen among its principals, analyzed scenes, characters and 
relationships at vast length. 
</P>
<P>
"Alan said that when he worked with other people's scripts he felt a great 
responsibility to the words. But he said that this time we didn't have to worry 
about the writer, we could toss the script out the window." 
</P>
<P>
The danger in such preparation is over-preparation and a loss of spontaneity. 
"But," Krige says, "when you have that ease with your character you can take it 
a step further." Occasionally Pakula and Bridges would have a whispered 
conference and come up with an unexpected line, likely to draw an unexpected 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"So we had, I think, a wonderful combination of rehearsal and spontaneity," she 
says. It is not always so. Doing television work, "Your head is on the block 
all the time, and those retakes you'd like to do you can't do."

One of the frustrations of the actor's life, she has found, is that you can't 
really be sure how well you've done. "I've come off stage thinking, 'Well, you 
really blew it tonight,' and been told it was magical. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be walking the knife edge all the time, trying to take the audience 
totally by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
She continues to think of herself as a working actress rather than as a star, 
although the roles increase. She would not like stardom to come between her and 
the audience, by coming between her and the free choice of work. The positive 
side is that more scripts come along. "But there's not such a lot of wonderful 
material out there, if you want to be challenged, and acting should never stop 
being a challenge."

Pakula's film is a love poem to love, marriage and family. Just after 
production was completed, Krige herself married actor-director Paul Schoolman. 
It was, in a sense, her early review of the picture.

PBS URGED TO ADDRESS DIRE STATE OF EDUCATION

Despite its proud history of educational programming, ranging from "Sesame 
Street" for preschoolers to college-credit telecourses for adults, the Public 
Broadcasting Service was admonished at its annual convention to take an even 
more prominent academic role by championing educational reform. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the obvious societal reasons for doing so, former Proctor &amp; Gamble 
chairman Owen B. Butler suggested in his keynote address, public television has 
a personal stake in helping to improve the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
The same people who are dropping out of high school -- he put the rate at 4,000 
a day nationwide -- are also "dropping out of your potential audience," said 
Butler, who now is chairman of the Committee for Economic Development, a 
private group of business executives and educators. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any of those kids have the kind of intellect that makes 
them interested in public-television programming," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
His speech Sunday at the Sheraton Harbor Island East Hotel here kicked off a 
four-day joint conference of PBS and the National Assn. of Public Television 
Stations. 
</P>
<P>
Butler underscored the need for educational reform by citing statistics that he 
said came from a Chicago Sun Times study last year: "Over 50% of the 
first-grade students in Chicago could not recite their last name, could not 
tell red from blue, or circle from square. Their vocabulary is not that well 
developed. But I'll bet you anything most of them could have told you the 
difference between crack and weed." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, immediately following Butler's speech, William McCarter, president 
and general manager of WTTW-TV, the major public television station in Chicago, 
did a little show-and-tell on two of the station's local programs involving 
education: the Illinois Young Performers' Competition, now in its fifth year, 
in which the station and Illinois Bell annually award $20,000 in scholarships 
in six performing-arts categories; and the Golden Apple Awards, now in its 
fourth year, which are presented each year to 10 outstanding Chicago-area 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The public television executives got down to business of a more routine nature 
Monday, debating various options for restructuring the way national programs 
are funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The corporation, which 
distributes federal funds to noncommercial radio and television stations, is 
under a mandate from Congress to consider revising its funding procedures. 
About $40 million from CPB currently helps support such PBS series as 
"Frontline" and "American Playhouse."

VOTER TURNOUT RUNS ABOUT HALF OF PREVIOUS YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voter turnout in today's Los Angeles municipal primary election, which city 
officials have predicted could be the lowest in decades, was running only about 
half that of previous years of mayoral races. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, 6.5% of the eligible voters had gone to the polls, compared to 11% in 
the last mayoral election in 1985 and 12.5% in 1981, according to the City 
Clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, 34.7% of the registered voters cast ballots in the April city 
primary election. But given a declining trend of voter turnout in city 
elections and relatively weak challenges to Mayor Tom Bradley and most 
incumbent City Council members, City Clerk Elias Martinez projected 25% to 30% 
of the city's 1.9 million registered voters will go to the polls today.

Rough seas that helped stall and break up some of the giant oil spill from the 
Exxon Valdez became calmer today, and winds shifted away from fish-rich Kodiak 
Island, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Kodiak still seems to be saved," said Jim Hayden, the state of Alaska's 
cleanup coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze said the spill appears to have stalled and is 
breaking up into tar balls. "That's better than ooey-gooey oil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment continued to pour into the area aboard military transports. About 67 
tons of material, everything from containment booms to absorbent pads, was 
arriving today. 
</P>
<P>
A huge Soviet oil-skimming vessel, the Vay Dagursky, is expected to arrive 
Saturday, state officials said. The ship can skim 200,000 gallons an hour and 
store 2 million gallons of oil on board.

Runaway Everglades brush fires sent thick black smoke across the Miami area 
today, prompting health warnings and an order to evacuate 700 aliens from a 
detention camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was so heavy," said 
Anna Nasher, who lives in suburban Coral Gables. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service advised people with asthma, emphysema and other 
respiratory problems to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very serious. We've got an emergency," said Perry Rivkind, district 
director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkind this morning ordered the evacuation of aliens from the Krome Avenue 
Detention Center on the edge of the Everglades as a brush fire advanced to 
within a mile. But by early afternoon, the aliens were still awaiting buses. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkind said the immigrants would be taken to the Bobby Maduro Baseball 
Stadium, which recently was used as a home for Nicaraguan refugees. But City 
Manager Cesar Odio suggested that they might be transferred to a facility in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke from fires about 20 miles away, including 3,000 burning acres of 
dried-out saw grass, blocked the subtropical sun and slowed traffic.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY POLICE ARREST PRISON ESCAPEE FROM MICH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fountain Valley police arrested an escaped felon from Michigan this morning 
after running a routine check of his Michigan license plate. 
</P>
<P>
Juan J. Mireles, 25, was arrested without incident along with three other men 
from Michigan as they walked to their car in the parking lot at the Econo Lodge 
near Magnolia Avenue and the San Diego Freeway shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Mireles had been serving a 5- to 15-year sentence for breaking and entering an 
occupied home, Michigan State Police Sgt. Bill Sholten said. But Mireles 
escaped from Camp Tuscola, a minimum-security prison camp in Caro, Mich., on 
Nov. 12. He was held in Orange County Jail without bail.

Police have arrested 11 Colombians, seized almost 1,200 pounds of cocaine and 
recovered about $103,000 in cash in Los Angeles and Orange counties, Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the suspects were arrested at a shopping center in Westminster, where 
about 950 pounds of cocaine was recovered from their van. Another 220 pounds of 
the drug was recovered from a home in Westminster. Gates said the suspects are 
"top-level people" in the distribution of drugs shipped in from overseas. He 
said most of the confiscated cocaine probably had been destined for shipment to 
other cities across the United States. The arrests late Monday culminated a 
two-month investigation, Gates said.

A fire engulfed a house where 12 people were sleeping in a 20-by-30-foot 
upstairs apartment without required smoke detectors today, killing nine, 
including seven children, and injuring three, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Rocky York said that authorities are looking for a person for 
questioning but that the person "is not an arson suspect at this time." 
Earlier, officials had said an initial investigation turned up "no sign of 
arson." 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 2:24 a.m. and the two-story wood-frame house was engulfed 
in flames when firefighters arrived, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Peoria Fire Chief John Parker said the fire started in the first-floor 
apartment, which was vacant, while the 12 people were asleep upstairs. "There 
were at least two families in there, maybe a visitor or two," he said.

Authorities in the republic of Georgia recalled 66,000 hunting rifles and other 
private guns and arrested hundreds of people today for breaking a curfew after 
nationalist riots in which 18 demonstrators were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The government daily Izvestia said the leaders of illegal demonstrations in the 
center of Tbilisi last weekend were among those held and it reported that 
tension had shifted to the outskirts of the Georgian capital. 
</P>
<P>
With flags flying at half-staff and many people dressed in black to mark a day 
of mourning, the paper said groups were threatening workers who tried to reach 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Investigation Pledged 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a native Georgian besieged with 
questions during meetings in Tbilisi with Georgian intellectuals and other 
residents, pledged to uncover the full circumstances of the deaths in Sunday's 
clashes between troops and nationalist protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"The people must be told everything. And we are convinced that the whole truth 
will be told directly," Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said 464 people were arrested and jailed for violating the 11 
p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew imposed after the riots when troops broke up a crowd 
shouting nationalist slogans in front of the Georgian government headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news 
conference the number of arrests was 200 and said that, as a temporary measure, 
the authorities began recalling the 66,000 or so private firearms registered in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said Shevardnadze, a former Georgian party leader who was sent to 
investigate the unrest, had talked with people on the city's streets. 
Shevardnadze won praise for defusing earlier national unrest in 1978 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miscalculation Admitted 
</P>
<P>
Georgian leader Dzhumber Patiashvili said on television that he had 
miscalculated by sending in troops, admitting that many who died were women and 
other innocent bystanders. They included a 70-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people, many of them women, were officially reported to have died when 
troops broke up an all-night nationalist demonstration early on Sunday by 8,000 
people outside a government building on the city's main street. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said a general criminal investigation had been opened after Sunday's 
events, but it was not yet clear against whom it was directed. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said 12 of the victims were asphyxiated and one, the 70-year-old 
woman, died of shock. An investigation was being conducted into the other 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Another two were known to have since died in hospitals and the figure could be 
higher, Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
A local journalist said more than 140 of the estimated 250 people hurt were 
still in hospitals.

3 HELD IN JERUSALEM ATTACK THAT KILLED 1 PALESTINIAN

Police said today that they are holding three Jewish men in connection with a 
submachine-gun attack in which one Palestinian was killed and three others were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came shortly after police fired rubber bullets at stone 
throwers, wounding one in the leg, during an hourlong funeral march for the 
slain Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
The three detainees "are suspected of being linked to what happened yesterday" 
but are not suspected of the actual shooting, Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi 
Sanduri said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to identify the men beyond saying two were from Jerusalem and one 
lived elsewhere in Israel. The suspects were detained Monday night and were 
still in custody, Sanduri said. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners decried Israel during the funeral procession through the Temple Mount 
compound, some shouting, "We warn the Jews: Mohammed's army will return!" 
</P>
<P>
Police opened fire after one youth smashed a window with his fist and others 
broke two windows with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 relatives and friends took part in the funeral march for Khaled 
Shawish, the 26-year-old blacksmith killed Monday when an attacker, dressed in 
army fatigues and believed to be an Israeli, opened fire with a Uzi submachine 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, who escaped on foot, also wounded three other Palestinians in the 
attack outside the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old Walled City of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
A caller claiming to represent a Jewish extremist group claimed responsibility 
for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, several dozen masked Palestinian youths gathered at Shawish's 
Old City home, waving Palestinian flags and vowing revenge against Jews. Police 
watched from nearby rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
One youth, masked with a kaffiyeh and hoisted on the shoulders of another, 
shouted: "We should teach the Jews a lesson! Everything Jewish in this town 
should be burned! We should prove that this is Palestinian and teach them a 
lesson of what a Palestinian state means." 
</P>
<P>
Other youths shouted, "Revolution against the occupier!" and "We want a 
Palestinian state!"

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat labeled Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
as "Mr. No" today and turned down his proposal for elections in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Poland that Shamir 
had rejected all peace proposals, and Palestinians had no interest in holding 
elections under the guns of Israeli troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 'Mr. No' doesn't accept any peace proposals, I ask what would you say 
about elections under occupation? I say 'yes' to elections but only after the 
end of the occupation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he was cutting short his Polish visit by several hours to fly to 
Morocco for an unscheduled meeting with King Hassan. He gave no further 
details.

But Buckingham Palace stressed in a statement that Laurence had remained on 
duty back at Windsor Castle Monday night.

<P>
The 34-year-old bachelor, a Royal Navy commander, had been scheduled to

As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of four of Laurence's letters to Anne

BUSH BALKS AT CRITICISM OF D.C. MAYOR

The White House put some distance today between President Bush and drug policy 
coordinator William J. Bennett's criticism of District of Columbia Mayor Marion 
Barry Jr. and his handling of drug-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in this to solve the drug problem, not to pick fights," said White 
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater when asked if Bush was ready to second 
Bennett's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious problem that has to be worked out with the authorities 
that were elected and charged with dealing with these problems," the 
presidential spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the President supports Bennett, Fitzwater replied, "Absolutely. He 
supports everything Bennett says and does." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bennett's Contention Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he welcomed the federal government's planned major drive on 
drug-related crime in the capital but rejected Bennett's contention that his 
Administration's poor performance made the intervention necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's plan, announced Monday, calls for construction of pretrial detention 
and prison facilities, expansion of a local law enforcement task force, efforts 
to rid public housing of drug users and dealers, expansion of drug treatment 
facilities and an increase in job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the D.C. government will receive no direct funding. Instead, Bennett 
said, the effort's $70-million to $80-million estimated cost will come from 
existing federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said this as frankly as possible -- the local government has not acted in 
as responsible a way as it should," Bennett said. "The plain fact is that, for 
too long and in too many respects, the D.C. government has failed to serve its 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Federal Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who is under federal investigation for his relationships with a 
suspected cocaine dealer, went on NBC-TV's "Today" show this morning to defend 
the local anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The D.C. government, I think, has been vigorous. We've had more people 
arrested than any other city in America -- over 12,000 people in jail, getting 
longer sentences."

PANEL SQUABBLES OVER DILUTION OF S&amp;L BAILOUT

<P>
A House banking panel battled today over proposals to weaken the heart of the 
Bush Administration's savings-and-loan bailout plan by diluting a requirement 
that S&amp;L owners back loans with more of their own money. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of a planned series of votes on proposed tougher capital 
standards, the House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions adopted, 30 
to 17, a weakening amendment offered by Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
The Administration wants to encourage S&amp;Ls to get out of areas such as real 
estate and insurance by requiring owners to back those investments entirely 
with their own capital. McCollum's amendment exempts healthy thrifts already 
engaged in those businesses from the stricter standard. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) argued against the change, saying risky areas not 
traditionally part of S&amp;Ls' business helped push the industry into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vice in the Past' 
</P>
<P>
"What we're saying with this amendment is that vice in the past is acceptable," 
Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the threat of a presidential veto, subcommittee members were preparing 
later in the day to vote on a proposal that the Administration says would gut 
the central reform in its bill. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush wants to increase S&amp;L capital requirements by June, 1991, 
from 3% of assets to 6%, contending that the more capital S&amp;L owners have 
at risk, the less likely they will be to take undue risks. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Treasury official this week reiterated the department's threat to 
recommend a veto if Congress waters down key elements of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise amendment on capital, worked out over the weekend by aides to 
committee members, would move up the deadline to June, 1990, but it would more 
broadly define capital, making it easier to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning From Greenspan 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a letter today, warned the 
panel that relaxing capital rules "invites continuation of the conditions that 
have led to the present crisis." 
</P>
<P>
"Such amendments raise the specter that additional public resources may be 
needed to correct the situation in the future," Greenspan said.

A House committee today approved legislation to reimpose limits on commercials 
in children's TV shows and require broadcasters to provide quality TV programs 
for children or lose their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote, sent the Children's 
Television Practices Act to the full House, where it was expected to pass 
easily. Congress passed the same bill last year, but then-President Ronald 
Reagan let it die without his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Authors of the bill said it was designed to stop the "over-commercialization" 
of children's TV shows by reinstituting limits on the amount of advertising 
that can be shown on such programs. The Federal Communications Commission in 
1974 limited commercials to 9 1/2 minutes per hour on such shows but repealed 
those limits in 1984.

The billionaire Pritzker family said today that it has cut its stake in Ramada 
Inc. to 4.8% from 7.2%, indicating that the Arizona-based hotelier has won a 
fight to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
HCC Corp., a Chicago-based company headed by Jay A. Pritzker, said in an April 
5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it had sold a total of 
959,100 shares of Ramada stock from March 16 through April 5 at an average 
price of $11.29 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Pritzker would not comment on the reasons for the stock sale, said his 
secretary, Rhonda Scheiss. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Ramada rejected HCC's $10-a-share offer for all of the 
company's stock and embarked on a corporate restructuring that included the 
sale of its 825 hotels.

The government is free to seek the indictment of Drexel Burnham Lambert for 
racketeering and securities fraud because the firm has failed to reach a 
required settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal 
prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel agreed in December to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million 
to avoid an indictment under the racketeering statute. Such an indictment, 
which would have to be made by a grand jury, would have dire consequences for 
Drexel because it would allow the government to seize assets even before a 
trial begins. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the U.S. attorney's office cannot become final unless Drexel 
reaches a settlement with the SEC in a separate civil case brought against the 
investment banker. Talks on settling these charges have been going on for 
months without success.

HOMER WELCOMES MURRAY TO THE NATIONAL LEAGUE

<P>
Eddie Murray was beginning to feel "very foolish" and confused in his first 
week in the National League. Then came the grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
Off to a 2-for-25 start as one of the newest Los Angeles Dodgers, Murray 
suddenly looked like the same man who hit 333 homers in 12 seasons with 
Baltimore in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a welcome-to-the-National-League hit for him," Dodgers pitcher 
Orel Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
The grand slam came in the ninth inning Monday night against San Francisco, 
ending a five-run rally for a 7-4 victory that ruined the Giants' home opener. 
(Story, Part III, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Murray still is hitting only .115, and his two other hits are 
singles. For Murray, it's just another in a long string of slow starts, though. 
That's the way he is. 
</P>
<P>
The difference this year? As the key off-season acquisition of the defending 
World Series champions, he was acutely aware that his annual spring slump was 
drawing a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the ball go over the fence, I thought, 'Finally I did something,' " 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect this from myself -- to do things," he said. "Not so much what 
everybody else expects. But I was starting to think about what everybody was 
expecting of me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, fans were anticipating a seven-time American League All-Star 
with a .295 career batting average and a .412 average with the bases loaded. 
They expected to see baseball's active grand slam leader -- now eighth all-time 
with 15 just behind Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Dave Kingman -- not an .080 
cleanup hitter with zero RBIs and runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Murray hit a split-fingered fastball from Mike LaCoss -- or so he was told. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so confused at this point that I have no idea what the pitch was," he 
said. "I was just trying to get one run in." 
</P>
<P>
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda was not worried that Murray had lost his touch, 
even though he had fallen to the two lowest batting averages of his career the 
past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the greatest clutch hitters in baseball," Lasorda said. "We knew 
it was just a matter of him getting adjusted. Kirk Gibson started that way last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said his slow start has nothing to do with switching leagues, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I knew something that would get me off to a good start," he said. 
"This is maybe my ninth bad start in 13 years. I have no idea what causes it. I 
hit the ball well in spring training."

Retired Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench, who will be inducted into

Manager Pete Rose bet on baseball, he should not be permitted a place in the

In an interview published today in the Cincinnati Enquirer, Bench said he wants 
to believe that Rose did not bet on baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
"If he bet on baseball games and games that he participated in, then, no, he 
should not be in the Hall of Fame," Bench told the newspaper. "If it's anything 
else, then it should not take away from what he accomplished on the field. No 
one can question what he did on the field."

Rose, 47, a Cincinnati native who holds 19 major records including all-time 
career hit leader with 4,256 hits, has said he considers himself to be a Hall

SPRINTER DENIES HE TOOK DRUGS WITH JOHNSON IN '81

Sprinter Desai Williams denied today that he began taking steroids along with 
teammate Ben Johnson in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Francis, who coached Canada's sprint team through the 1988 Summer 
Olympics, has identified Williams as one of the athletes who for years took the 
banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie knew my thoughts on anabolic steroids," Williams told a federal 
inquiry into drugs in amateur sport, adding that he is opposed to the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 29, said Francis took him in 1981 to see Dr. Gunter Helge Koch of 
Toronto, where he had a physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Francis then broached the subject of steroids but that Koch was 
opposed to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor said: 'No, this a strong young guy, I don't think it's necessary.' 
He said: 'I don't want to get involved in this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he and Francis left the doctor's office and the coach handed him 
a bottle of steroid pills. 
</P>
<P>
"I was startled," said Williams, adding he later threw the bottle away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Do Things His Way' 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he did not throw the pills away in front of Francis because "I 
knew Charlie's outlook on steroids. I had to do things his way or I took the 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who still is competing, won a bronze medal at the 1984 Los Angeles 
Olympics as part of Canada's 1,600-meter relay team. He also made the finals in 
the 100 meters at last fall's Seoul Olympics.

The Jockey Club will investigate the safety of the Grand National after the 
deaths of two horses in this year's running of the world's best-known 
steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today, the club, which controls horse racing in 
Britain, said trainers, jockeys and officials of the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will be questioned about possible changes in 
the course, including the notorious Becher's Brook jump. Animal-rights 
advocates have called for changes, such as reducing the field from 40 horses to 
30 and lowering jumps such as Becher's, sixth of 30 jumps on the 4 1/2-mile 
circuit. Becher's stands 4-foot-10 on the takeoff side but has a 12-foot-deep 
trench on the landing zone. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Becher's claimed a top runner, Dark Ivy. On Saturday, two 
horses, Brown Trix and Seeandem, were killed in falls at Becher's.
