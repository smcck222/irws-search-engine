NEWSMAKERS: THE FIRST LADY'S BACK TO NORMAL

Looking fresh and slimmer than usual, First Lady Barbara Bush left Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center after undergoing treatment to control a thyroid condition. 
During her two-hour hospital visit, Mrs. Bush drank a radioactive iodine 
solution to destroy her thyroid gland because it was producing excess levels of 
hormones. The condition, known as Graves' disease, caused her to lose 21 pounds 
in recent weeks and irritated her eyes. The treatment, which takes about two to 
three months to deactivate the thyroid, is standard for the ailment, which can 
be life threatening if left untreated. Doctors told Mrs. Bush she should not 
hug her dog's new puppies or kiss any of her 11 grandchildren for a few days 
because puppies and children have a heightened sensitivity to radiation. 
Otherwise her normal activity should not be interrupted. Only hours afterward, 
she hosted a White House reception for Queen Silvia of Sweden. "I never felt 
sick," Mrs. Bush said. "I never felt better." Referring to her weight loss, she 
said: "I like half of my disease. In fact, I love half of it."

 -- John Tower, whose nomination to be defense secretary was derailed in part 
by allegations of drinking and womanizing, has signed a book contract with the 
Little, Brown publishing house. But the former Texas senator won't be penning a 
torrid kiss-and-tell tale. Instead, the relationship he'll be exposing will be 
that between Congress and the presidency. Actually, Tower had signed to write 
such a book two years ago, but he didn't have enough time for it. The new book 
is expected in the fall of 1990 and will include passages about his rejection 
by the Senate.

 -- A retired Australian sheep shearer who inherited the title of Earl of 
Lincoln enjoyed his visit to his namesake city in Britain, but even the 
prospect of sitting in the House of Lords wasn't enough to make him want to 
stay. Edward Fiennes-Clinton, 75, and his wife, Linda, decided to return home 
after learning there is no ancestral home to go with the title -- only a seat 
in the hereditary House of Lords. Fiennes-Clinton inherited the 16th-Century 
title on Christmas Day upon the death in Britain of a remote relation, the 10th 
Duke of Newcastle and Earl of Lincoln. Because the duke had no children, the 
dukedom became extinct. But the lesser title of the Lincoln earldom passed to 
the Australian, whose forebears had emigrated. Fiennes-Clinton said being the 
18th Earl of Lincoln "won't change our lives. We are still the same people and 
I hope it's not going to change me at all." Still, he said, "it is an old and 
honorable title and I would like to carry it on in the few years left to me."

As President Bush throws out the first ball signifying the start of the 
baseball season and our national pastime, let us all hope that when the World 
Series rolls around and George sits down about that time to talk to Mikhail 
Gorbachev that he manages to hold his own in the "World Serious" talks. 
</P>
<P>
We certainly can't afford a "Bush League" performance when he makes that

POINTS OF LIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
As a father, one of the daily rituals I cherish most is reading to my kids. My 
6 year old is currently on his second excursion through the "Chronicles of 
Narnia," by C.S. Lewis. The sixth installment of the "Chronicles" is entitled 
"The Magician's Nephew," wherein we encountered the following: "One moment 
there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of 
light leaped out." 
</P>
<P>
So now we know what George Bush's speech writers read -- kiddie lit. At least 
it's good kiddie lit, and my estimation of our President's staff has been 
elevated a notch.

UTAH FUSION EXPERIMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The supreme arrogance of H.W. Lewis' remarks ("Clearing Fusion Off the Table 
Top," Op-Ed Page, April 6) set me thinking about religion. 
</P>
<P>
While he was castigating the media for doing what they do best -- seizing upon 
a sexy story -- and seemed to have contempt for the notion that unknown 
physical processes could somehow be taking place to account for the results 
attained by the Utah physicists, I was struck with a thought about Copernicus. 
</P>
<P>
Copernicus came along with new insights which upset the dogmas of the ruling 
high priests of truth in his day, the Catholic Church. Now it appears Lewis 
fears for his own dogmas, and he certainly comes from the modern equivalent of 
the high priests of truth, the world of physics. 
</P>
<P>
Dogmatics tend to engage in turf battles, seeking the most converts to their 
view -- usually because they have some vested interest in their own dogma. 
Could it be that his assertion that politicians fund only "real (and expensive) 
fusion" research leaves him showing his dogma? 
</P>
<P>
Any rational mind knows that truth is the most subjective and malleable of 
substances. This is why science deals in theories and does not call its 
findings absolute truths, as many religions do, for invariably new information 
or creative thinking comes to light to broaden our understanding of existing 
theories or supplant them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis remarks, "Sufficiently enhanced cold fusion to make useful amounts of 
energy in ordinary matter, without the discovery of a new subatomic particle 
like the muon, would mean that all we know about the science of electrons, 
deuterons and solids is completely wrong, not just slightly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis overreacts. It could be simply that we are viewing the mountain from afar 
as obscured by trees. Perhaps the Utah researchers' "one in a billion" 
experiments have moved us slightly closer, beyond some trees, and now we see 
the mountain slightly differently, and must now make sense of what we see.

ABORTION: 'LONG LINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial on abortion was excellent. I sincerely appreciate it. I have been 
waiting and watching for a historical story. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much time, energy and money wasted on fetuses and almost no concern 
or compassion for newborns with AIDS or drug dependencies, or babies lacking 
proper care. 
</P>
<P>
There is much too much preaching instead of support for more facts, more 
knowledge and more education.

<P>
IT'S AN ISSUE OF RIGHT AND WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice and a philosopher of 
the pro-choice movement, says that the language of women's rights, so obvious 
and potent to these marchers (Mind Your Own Uterus), means something else to 
the middle Americans of the late '80s: selfishness. The talk about the "right" 
to abortion should turn to talk about the "need" for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Kissling also utters words that are taboo among some of her colleagues. "Some 
abortions are indeed immoral," she says. Abortion for gender selection is one 
clear example. Pro-choicers shouldn't be afraid to raise these moral issues. "I 
accept abortion on every level," says Kissling, "but I still firmly believe it 
would be better if women did not become pregnant when they were not prepared to 
create life." 
</P>
<P>
Those who believe deeply in the need to keep abortion safe and legal must 
present their position as both caring and responsible. Responsible means that 
pro-choice advocates "have to stop making excuses for women who won't use birth 
control." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to admit ambiguity in the face of the militant certainty of the 
anti-abortionists. It is hard to expand a traditional and honorable vocabulary 
of "rights" into a wider discussion of "needs." But by expressing their own 
values and their understanding of ambiguity, those who support legal abortion 
may well increase their standing in the eyes of the ambivalent many.

ISRAEL AND PLO ARE ALREADY TALKING; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE THE LINK OF U.S. MEDIATION, PACE WILL REMAIN SLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZE'EV SCHIFF, Ze'ev Schiff, defense editor of the Israeli daily Haaretz, is 
currently the Koret fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main conclusion emerging from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's visit to 
Washington is that indirect negotiations have in effect been initiated between 
the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel with the mediation of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
One has to be totally blind not to recognize this fact. The proposals the 
United States has received from Israel will now be transmitted to the PLO in 
Tunisia. The American representatives will try to sell the ideas of the Israeli 
prime minister to the PLO leadership. They will then come back from Tunisia 
with counterproposals on how to start the first stage of the peace process and 
so on, back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir may insist that Israel will never negotiate with the PLO under any 
circumstances, but both he and the rest of the Israeli Cabinet understand that 
from now on, the Americans will shuttle between them and the PLO with proposals 
and counterproposals. 
</P>
<P>
Elections in the occupied territories will only strengthen this trend. If 
Shamir's proposal is accepted, there can only be one outcome: The PLO 
representatives will win. This already happened in the 1976 municipal elections 
in the West Bank; PLO representatives were elected then. If elections are held 
in the territories, Shamir will have no choice but to accept those elected 
after he himself has proposed to start the process. Shamir will call them 
representatives of the Palestinian population, but in reality they will be PLO 
representatives, more authentic perhaps than the PLO leadership outside the 
territories but nonetheless taking their directives from PLO headquarters in 
Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
There are conflicts of interest between the Palestinian residents of the 
territories and the PLO representatives abroad, which may deepen in the future, 
but it is a mistake to think that one can drive a wedge between the two groups. 
Both have the same objective -- get rid of the Israeli occupation and gain 
independence. Neither group wants to be weakened by being separated from the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the Israeli leadership is outwardly clinging to a fiction, 
maintaining that the PLO does not exist and that the Palestinian residents of 
the territories do not want to be represented by it. For the moment, the Bush 
Administration is willing to let the Israeli government live with this fiction, 
provided the process is initiated. 
</P>
<P>
Likud, whose representatives are now conducting Israel's foreign policy, will 
find that just as in the case of the "Jordanian option," anyone who wishes to 
end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will not be able to do so without the PLO. 
Hence, rather than look for substitutes, efforts should be made to change the 
PLO, see to it that the moderates in its ranks in the territories and Tunis 
control the organization and accept Israel's minimal military conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Is Shamir prepared to cooperate in this process? His talks in Washington 
indicate that, at least in the initial stage, he is willing to coordinate the 
first moves with the United States. The fact that the United States is engaged 
in a dialogue with the PLO has not deterred him. He has not brought along a 
plan, but rather a few ideas, the central one being the holding of democratic 
elections in the territories. In the past, including in the Camp David accords, 
it was agreed that such elections would only take place after the transition 
period. 
</P>
<P>
At this point Shamir is prepared to hold elections beforehand, at an earlier 
stage, provided violence in the territories is stopped. He is even willing to 
find a way that will enable the Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed East 
Jerusalem to take part. Shamir accepts the idea, embodied in the Camp David 
accords, that the process will not stop at the interim stage and that 
negotiations on the final status of the territories are to be expected. He 
would not, however, go beyond that line. 
</P>
<P>
His talks in Washington show once again that, when it comes to the West Bank, 
he is not willing to adopt the formula of territory for peace. Shamir's 
interpretation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 is altogether different 
from the interpretation of the framers of the resolution, who at the time 
consulted Israel's representatives as well, and of course from the 
interpretation of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This, in effect, eliminates any possibility of negotiations between Israel and 
Jordan. Even if King Hussein were willing to represent the Palestinians in 
negotiations with Israel, and the Palestinians themselves agreed to it, there 
would be no basis for initiating negotiations under such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Are the ideas that Shamir brought to Washington sufficient to move along the 
peace process? They are sufficient to start the process and get over the first 
hurdle. This is why Washington could not reject Shamir's ideas outright and 
stop the process before it even began. Shamir's proposal will have no meaning 
or value if in the meantime the government of Israel keeps its promise and 
establishes new settlements in the territories. In order for the wagon to start 
rolling, the American diplomats will have to wrap the proposal in the proper 
packaging and persuade the PLO to allow the Palestinians in the territories to 
go to the polls. It is clear that the PLO will not accept the proposal before 
it knows what its place in these elections will be. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who expected to see a quick resolution of the blood-drenched conflict is 
bound to be disappointed with the results of the Washington visits of Shamir 
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and the expected visit of King Hussein. 
Washington itself is planning its moves by taking tiny steps across the entire 
front, rather than looking for spectacular breakthroughs. For the moment, the 
Palestinians will have to make do with this slow pace. As for Shamir, and the 
viewpoint he represents, this means gaining time. But Israel is left with the 
difficult dilemma of a person who holds a glowing coal in his hand and cannot 
throw it away.

A BREAK IN RISK-REWARD CONNECTION ALLOWED VALDEZ SPILL TO HAPPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CRITTENDEN, Ann Crittenden is the author of Sanctuary (Weidenfeld &amp; 
Nicolson, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're playing a dangerous game, and you swear that it's safe, aren't you 
responsible if someone gets hurt? 
</P>
<P>
If you make a gigantic mess, don't you have to clean it up? 
</P>
<P>
If the Internal Revenue Service suspects you didn't pay your taxes, aren't you 
subject to a painstaking audit? 
</P>
<P>
In a capitalist system, isn't there supposed to be some connection between risk 
and reward? 
</P>
<P>
One of the most sickening things about the oil spill off the Alaskan coast is 
what it says about the way the world really works. 
</P>
<P>
It is another cynical lesson that the really big players don't have to play by 
the same rules that apply to the rest of us. In this case, a Titanic foul-up by 
a major oil company, those responsible will not really pay the price. We will. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, taxpayers and consumers will subsidize the cost of the whole 
murderous mess. Exxon's loss of more than 10 million gallons of oil from the 
Exxon Valdez can be fully written off corporate income taxes, as can all of the 
cleanup costs paid by the company. No wonder Exxon announced that cost was no 
object in attacking the spill. They aren't paying it. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is absolutely unclear who in the end is going to pick up the tab 
from the damages caused by the spill -- Exxon, its insurers or the taxpayers. 
The rules on who is ultimately responsible in such disasters are extremely 
muddy and desperately need to be clarified. Congress, by setting up a welter of 
insurance funds, tried to socialize the risk so that no oil company would face 
bankruptcy in the event of something like the Valdez catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
But if the risk is socialized, the rewards of the deadly oil traffic remain 
firmly private. In the wake of the spill, the price of crude oil and products 
have skyrocketed -- the largest single oil price increase in history. As a 
result, oil companies as a whole have made tens of millions of dollars on the 
disaster, to such an extent that industry insiders kid that Exxon slid onto 
that reef on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
That may be a sick joke, but it points to the dangerous lack of accountability 
in this disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the corporate mind would be more focused if responsible executives, right 
on up to the chairman, lost their jobs when something like this happens. The 
president of Japan Air Lines stepped down when one of his jets crashed. 
Lawrence Rawls, Exxon chief executive, is still there, drawing his generous 
salary. Conceivably, if he and others down the line who grew complacent and 
ultimately put a known alcoholic in charge of a tanker knew that their jobs 
were at stake, this accident might not have happened. 
</P>
<P>
This spill might also prompt some rethinking about oil company taxes. If the 
public bears most of the cost of the destruction of the environment and 
millions of Earth's creatures, then perhaps the public purse ought to enjoy 
more of the gain from the hazardous commerce in oil. In a free enterprise 
system, theoretically at least, there should be some connection between risk 
and reward. 
</P>
<P>
That principle was reflected in the Windfall Profits Tax of 1980, which sought 
to capture the profits that domestic oil producers reaped when the price of 
domestic oil was deregulated and rose to the OPEC cartel price. But did the 
companies overpay that tax as intended? The IRS believes that at least some of 
the producers operating in Alaska and California did not; that they 
significantly underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the IRS issued a deficiency notice to Arco for $1.2 billion for 
underpayment of taxes from 1980 to 1983 on windfall profits from the Alaskan 
North Slope. That figure does not include possible underpayments from 1983 to 
mid-1985, when prices fell below the windfall profits tax-base price, or 
underpayments by the other major producers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in California -- in the controller's office, the state Lands 
Commission and in the City of Long Beach -- and some industry analysts believe 
that the oil companies have avoided paying the windfall profits tax on oil 
produced in California as well. They suspect this was accomplished by means of 
a complicated system of underpricing crude oil when it was sold to the 
companies' refining subsidiaries. This had the effect of transferring the 
profits "downstream," so that they would be taxed at the then-corporate rate of 
46% instead of at the much-higher windfall profits rate. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is pending in several court cases in California, and the oil 
companies have spent tens of millions of dollars in legal fees challenging the 
complex charges. If the companies lose, they stand to pay plenty. Officials 
estimate that the damages to the state of California alone, in lost tax 
revenues and oil royalties, came to at least $550 million between 1980 and 
1985. The losses to the federal treasury could run into the billions, but so 
far the IRS has not aggressively pursued the case. 
</P>
<P>
If Alaskan and California crude oil has systematically been priced below its 
fair market value, how can rational environmental decisions be made? If this 
oil is in fact more valuable than past pricing would indicate, then the 
government can and should have imposed tighter and more costly precautions on 
the ways the companies have been operating. 
</P>
<P>
That and a few heads on the line might have spared us our current grief.

<P>
IT'S AN ISSUE OF RIGHT AND WRONG

<P>
The Supreme Court's abortion ruling did not occur in a vacuum. It followed the 
turbulent 1960s, in which many standards for right and wrong were jettisoned in 
favor of a "do your own thing" mentality. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the "me decade" inevitably followed the repeal of a moral code, so did 
legalized abortion result from this new emphasis on self. Divorces skyrocketed, 
venereal diseases became epidemic, drugs began killing our children and 
trashing our cities, pornography moved out of darkened pool halls to foul the 
mainstream, ethics were regularly violated in high places. Having abandoned our 
compass, our ship lost direction and ran aground, like the Exxon tanker in 
Alaska, spewing forth cultural pollution that has yet to be cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
This debate is not about how many people each side can put in the streets, how 
much money the abortion industry can spend on newspaper and television ads or 
how many lawyers can file amicus briefs. It is about right and wrong.

'WINTER PEOPLE': COLD COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Winter People," which opens the AFI/Fest tonight and plays in selected 
theaters beginning Friday, has so many arresting characters and facets that 
when it begins to go completely haywire it's like watching someone you've 
become rather fond of come unglued. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sobieski's screenplay, adapted from the carefully wrought novel of North 
Carolina regional novelist John Ehle, sets a father and young daughter from 
more citified Pennsylvania down in the middle of an isolated Smoky Mountains 
community, mid-Depression time. Wayland Jackson (Kurt Russell) is a decent, 
gentle, humorous man with patience enough to make clocks, which happens to be 
his trade. Recently widowered and only now coming out of it, he is the devoted 
father to a ferocious, outspoken 10-year old daughter, Paula (splendid newcomer 
Amelia Burnette). 
</P>
<P>
When their car gets stuck in a country stream, father and daughter stumble down 
through misty woods onto a remote mountain compound belonging to Collie Wright 
(Kelly McGillis) a notably suspicious woman, and her beautiful, 6-month-old 
son, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
Collie, it seems, is a pridefully unmarried mother, although she has kept the 
father's identity secret. (It doesn't take vast detective work to ferret out 
the man however; if you remember the Hatfields and the McCoys or Romeo and 
Juliet you might have a clue.) 
</P>
<P>
Having this baby has alienated Collie from her mother, but not her patriarchal 
father (Lloyd Bridges) or her three brothers: the weak, guilt-ridden 
storekeeper Gudger (Lanny Flaherty), stocky blacksmith Milton (David Dwyer), or 
Young (Don Michael Paul), obviously the youngest, a handsome, traveling, 
all-purpose hell-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Almost instantly, Jackson and Paula are taken up by the lonely Collie, although 
the specter of the baby's father, who may return at any moment, hangs over 
their growing involvement. Jackson, whom Collie quarters in an out-building, is 
introduced to this close-knit mountain community and even persuades the Wright 
clan to back the building of an enormous clock tower in the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
Sobieski's dialogue is respectful of Ehle's beautifully written North Carolina 
talk, expanding it at times inventively. But, excepting nicely played scenes 
between Jackson, Collie and Paula, the tone that director Ted Kotcheff has set 
begins to seems ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
Don Michael Paul has been encouraged to play the lusty Young like every amateur 
auditioning for the role of the Rainmaker in a bus-and-truck touring company. 
The baby's father looks and acts like a slathering, backwoods Rasputin. It 
makes it impossible to imagine Collie with him more than once, and theirs was 
supposed to be a love affair that went on for more than two years. The 
suspicion rises that this off-beat property may be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
It's a feeling that gets stronger with our first introduction to the Campbell 
clan, rivals to the Wrights and headed by elder Drury Campbell (Mitchell Ryan). 
They're first seen robbing and vandalizing the Jackson's stranded car like a 
pack of howling, bearded degenerates. Granted that these hunters and trappers 
are nearly barbaric in the novel; they still cannot be played like the North 
Carolina branch of Faulkner's vicious, inbred Snopes family, or the film and 
its relationships are in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Ehle has written with the utmost precision, neatly delineating country people 
and their beautiful, oppressive surroundings with loving attention. It's 
important that the Campbell and Wright patriarchs be imposing, nuanced figures. 
Kotcheff slurps effects onto his canvas with strokes broad enough to cover a 
barn. 
</P>
<P>
And what, in heaven's name, attracted Kurt Russell to a role where he could be 
upstaged by a 10-year-old, by an imitation Rainmaker or by a raving backwoods 
madman?) 
</P>
<P>
The melodrama does plays itself out with an uncommon number of unexpected 
twists. However, Collie's extraordinary decision near the close of the story 
snaps what credulity we may still be hanging onto. It's an essentially literary 
device that may hold up better on a page than on a screen. Or better on any 
page than on this screen. 
</P>
<P>
Collie's action is like an inversion of the famous Faulkner story in "Knight's 
Gambit," which became the poignant film "Tomorrow" and may -- still -- contain 
one of Robert Duvall's greatest performances. It centers around a lovingly 
raised child taken over by a brutish, vicious family. Because of the way the 
Campbells have been drawn here, Collie's act, difficult enough to understand 
under any circumstances, becomes absolutely unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in a last indignity, the film makers graft a 
sunshine-through-the-tears ending onto Ehle's stoic, entirely fitting 
conclusion, a horse-trading session between the patriarchs which conveys 
continuity, birthright and dynasty. (Writer Sobieski cannot be entirely removed 
from responsibility here, since she was also the supervising producer, under 
the principal producer, Robert Solo.) 
</P>
<P>
"The Winter People" (rated PG-13 for some of its brutality and rough language) 
is nevertheless a handsomely realized production. Its production designer Ron 
Foreman has made details like Gudger's store realistic but never quaint; the 
work of cinematographer Francois Protat ("The Hitchhiker," "Joshua Then and 
Now") is exquisite and subdued without calling attention it itself, as is the 
succinct work of editor Thom Noble. 
</P>
<P>
And given the improbable demands of her part, McGillis makes a heroic Collie, 
although the notion of her wild unbridled passion for the baby's ruttish father 
seems to fall a little short of, say, Cathy's for Heathcliff. For my money, the 
movie's most intriguing performance is by the young, matter-of-fact Amelia 
Burnette who, in the freezing cold, manages lines like "I can't move my 
fingers" without a hint of whining. Atta girl.

A miniature Koran by an unknown 10th-Century scribe has been auctioned for a 
record $297,000. Christie's auction house in London says the price paid for the 
little book of 332 vellum pages, less than 3 inches tall and written in Eastern 
Kufic script, was the highest ever paid for a Koran or part of one. The buyer 
was only identified as representing a European collection. Christie's had put a 
top estimate on the Koran of $169,000. A single decorated leaf from a large 
Koran made the previous record of $268,000 in London in October. ALEENE MacMINN

Liza Minnelli took exception Wednesday to wire service reports that she tried 
to "smuggle" her dog into Sweden earlier this week. Spokesmen for the 
actress-singer said Minnelli's shaggy Scottish terrier, Lilly, was sitting next 
to her, plainly visible, on a car ferry from Denmark, and Minnelli had been 
given wrong information about Sweden's quarantine laws for pets. As to reports 
that she threatened to cancel her appearance with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis 
Jr. after customs agents came to seize the dog at her hotel, Minnelli's 
representative said, "She never threatened to cancel. She's too much a 
professional to do that." Liza and Lilly will be reunited April 23 in Paris, 
after the singer completes dates in Norway, Finland and London. ALEENE MacMINN

The Motion Picture Assn. of America's ratings board has lifted an X rating and 
assigned an R to "Scandal," the Miramax film about the 1963 Profumo sex affair 
that rocked the British government. After losing an appeal last week to have 
the rating changed, the producers submitted a re-edited version of an orgy 
scene responsible for the X rating. Most theater chains refuse to exhibit 
X-rated films and some newspapers will not accept their advertisements. A 
spokeswoman for Miramax said the orgy scene still runs the same length and no 
sex acts in the original version have been omitted.ALEENE MacMINN

COFFEE, TEA; 
</P>
<P>
ALMOST-LOST ARTS OF BREWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making coffee and tea are old arts. But it's amazing how they have gotten lost 
through the years. There is a right way and a wrong way to brew each, and 
unfortunately they are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
While very hot -- but not boiling -- water should be used for coffee, boiling 
water is best for tea. That's for starters. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee: Brewing the perfect cup of coffee requires the perfect water 
temperature and the perfect amount of coffee, which requires adjustments for 
personal taste. The water should be 195 to 205 degrees (cooler would not be hot 
enough to extract the flavor of the grind; warmer would be boiling and cut off 
the oxygen), while the best holding temperature is 180 to 185 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
To begin, plan on 2 1/2 ounces of ground coffee per 12-cup pot. Pour the grinds 
into the open filter and pour water over them. The best coffee is fresh coffee, 
so try to brew a pot using individual, prepackaged packets. The best guarantee 
of freshness from larger quantities, whether whole beans or ground, is 
air-tight storage in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
Tea: The use of hot water leaves most of the tea flavor in the tea leaves, not 
in the pot, so remember the adage: "Bring the pot to the kettle, not the kettle 
to the pot." In other words, keep the water boiling until you pour it into the 
teapot. 
</P>
<P>
Heating the teapot first -- preferably a china or clay pot -- with hot tap 
water helps. Then pour the water over the tea (about one teaspoon per person 
and one for the pot) and cover to help keep the aroma in the tea. Steep for 3 
to 5 minutes and remove the leaves immediately. 
</P>
<P>
As for storage, keep the tea in an airtight canister in a dark place; never put 
it in the refrigerator, because the tea could absorb moisture there and impair 
the quality.

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: TURKEY ENTREES PROVIDE LOW-FAT FOUNDATION FOR 7-DAY 
DIET PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dieting? Who isn't these days. If a week's worth of diet menus would be a 
welcome reprieve for day-to-day planning, calculating and measuring regime, 
read on. 
</P>
<P>
The following diet was developed with the help of a registered dietitian. It 
contains a seven-day weight-loss plan, designed by Dr. Joan Walsh, director of 
Western Nutritional Services, including delicious meals and easy recipes. It 
provides all the instructions, daily menus and recipes so you can clip it out 
and hang it on the refrigerator for quick reference. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is built around a foundation of turkey entrees, since turkey is one 
source of protein that is naturally low in fat. Each dish may be accompanied by 
a serving of carbohydrate, vegetable or one cup of skim milk (except where 
milk, vegetable and carbohydrate are combined in the dinner entree such as soup 
or pasta dish). 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, you will need to meet the carbohydrate serving for each dinner 
menu by selecting either one-half cup brown rice, one corn muffin, one small 
boiled potato with one teaspoon margarine, or one cranberry-bran muffin as a 
side dish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vegetable Serving 
</P>
<P>
The vegetable serving each day might be chosen from one of these: one cup 
cooked crookneck squash, three-quarters cup glazed carrots, sliced tomato and 
cucumber salad, romaine lettuce salad with one tablespoon reduced-calorie 
dressing, fresh spinach and mushroom salad with one tablespoon reduced-calorie 
dressing or one cup steamed broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to dinner menus, there are suggestions for breakfast and lunch that 
make them quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not a diet without rules. Here are some tips offered by Walsh: 
</P>
<P>
This basic diet is designed to supply about 1,200 calories per day, so be 
careful not to add extra calories with items such as butter, margarine, oil or 
salad dressing. Follow the meal plans and recipes as closely as possible, 
measuring portions carefully. 
</P>
<P>
When no beverage is specified, include a non-caloric beverage such as coffee, 
tea, diet soda or water. Do not drink milk or juices except where suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce the recipes if cooking for fewer than the specified number of servings. 
Or cook the full meal and freeze half for later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exercise Weekly 
</P>
<P>
Exercise continuously for 15 to 60 minutes three to five days during the week. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still hungry, choose one serving from the following list of extras. 
This will add about 100 more calories to the day: one-half cantaloupe; one 
muffin; one banana or apple; one peach; one cup grapes; one slice bread with 
one teaspoon margarine; two medium or three small cookies; one-half cup sherbet 
or ice milk; one ounce hard cheese; one slice bread with one slice turkey ham; 
one cup puffed wheat cereal with one-half cup nonfat milk; two cups popcorn 
with two teaspoons melted margarine; one cup orange juice; one-half carton 
fruit flavored yogurt; one-half cup gelatin; one (4-ounce) glass red, white or 
rose wine, or one (12-ounce) can light beer. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that as with any diet, you won't become slender overnight. It is, 
however, possible to lose two pounds per week, the amount that nutritionists 
believe is safe, according to Walsh.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: CORN SYRUP AS A HONEY SUBSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I was getting ready to bake a dessert when I realized I didn't 
have the honey that the recipe called for. It happened that a friend was 
visiting and she told me I could substitute corn syrup for honey or granulated 
sugar. I didn't argue with her but it didn't seem right. Can you actually make 
this substitution? 
</P>
<P>
 -- CONFUSED BAKER, Casper, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CONFUSED: Generally, corn syrup can be substituted for honey in most 
recipes. When using corn syrup, remember that it isn't as sweet as the honey 
and that the dessert in turn will not be as sweet. 
</P>
<P>
When substitutions are made, the texture and flavor of recipes will be slightly 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot substitute corn syrup for granulated sugar. With one being a liquid 
and the other a dry ingredient, it's difficult to adjust the ingredients in the 
recipe so that it would come out correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I love popcorn and pop it in the evenings to take to work the 
next day to snack on. I put it in a large resealable plastic bag. I cut a small 
hole in the corner of the bag, give the bag a good shake and all the unpopped 
kernels come out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Now when I grab a handful of popcorn I don't worry about the loose kernels 
breaking one of my teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- OLIVIA, Red Bank, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: I have received many requests for the ingredients I use in my 
coffee ole, so I thought I would pass it along. 
</P>
<P>
Make a regular cup of coffee, add a little extra skim milk and a tablespoon of 
powdered skim milk. Add sugar (I use artificial sweetener) to taste. Put this 
mixture in the blender and blend until it is foamy. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure that the coffee mug is microwaveable and place it in the microwave on 
Warm for just a couple of seconds. This gives the coffee a wonderful new taste. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: At one time I read a hint that said you could ripen avocados in 
the microwave. Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
 -- EVELYN, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 
</P>
<P>
DEAR EVELYN: The hint that we printed said to poke several holes in an avocado 
and place it in the microwave on MEDIUM heat (50%) for about two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
However, after further testing of this hint, we found it didn't work every 
time. It did help some of the avocados, while others were soft but still tasted 
unripe. You might want to give it a try to see how your avocado comes out. 
</P>
<P>
You can also put an unripe avocado in a brown paper bag and fold over the top 
to close and put in a warm place. (The top of the refrigerator is good.) It 
should be ripe in two to three days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: During hectic mornings, everything used to stop while my husband 
and I searched for the correct change for our child's lunch, bus or milk money. 
</P>
<P>
Now we keep a bowl by the door. When we have change we drop it in the bowl. 
This way the children have change for whatever reason and mornings are a little 
bit easier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KATHY, Bangor, Me. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Is there a substitute for powdered sugar? It seems that whenever 
I need some I never have it. I hate going to the grocery store for only one 
item. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JENNIE, El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JENNIE: After speaking with our local home economist, the following is the 
substitution we found to work best. 
</P>
<P>
You will need one cup of granulated sugar and one tablespoon of cornstarch. 
Place this in a blender on high speed for several minutes. It will be powdery 
and ready for use. 
</P>
<P>
As with most substitutes, the consistency and texture of the dish may be 
altered slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have seen several pet peeves in your column and thought I would 
share mine with you: when merchants affix difficult-to-remove price stickers 
directly to the merchandise or directly over the instructions on the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
I spend hours trying to get these off, and it really burns me up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- READER, Chicago 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: This is one of my peeves too. I have this problem when I am 
looking at a package and want to read the ingredients or the calorie count and 
the sticker is covering it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints 
received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

WINE NOTES: BRITISH CONCERN PLANS TO BUY BORDEAUX HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allied-Lyons, the British brewer and distiller, has announced plans to acquire 
Chateau Latour, one of France's finest top Bordeaux houses. 
</P>
<P>
Allied-Lyons has had a 25.2% stake in Chateau Latour for 26 years and now aims 
to acquire the 53.5% held by Pearson, the conglomerate that owns the Financial 
Times of London, for $94.4 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Allied-Lyons also has offered substantially the same financial 
arrangement to News International, which holds an 18.5% stake and to all the 
other shareholders. This would value Chateau Latour at $185 million. 
</P>
<P>
Chateau Latour, situated in the Medoc district, is one of the five Premier Cru 
wines of Bordeaux. Like the others -- Lafite, Margaux, Mouton-Rothschild and 
Haut-Brion -- it can command among the highest prices on release. 
</P>
<P>
As a multiple of earnings, the price makes Chateau Latour the most expensive 
vineyard ever sold. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, chairman of Allied-Lyons, said the ownership of 
Chateau Latour as part of a portfolio that included Courvoisier, Canadian Club 
and Ballantine's was of outstanding value. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of Chateau Latour in underwriting our credentials as a world 
leader in wines and spirits and providing a further powerful entree to the 
major markets is immeasurable." He said Alan Hare had agreed to stay on as 
chairman and manager of Chateau Latour. 
</P>
<P>
In the year ended Dec. 31 Chateau Latour made a pre-tax profit of $6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the controversial Stag's Leap appellation fight is over and that name 
has been approved for wines coming from an area in the southeastern sector of 
the Napa Valley, a new appellation application has been filed with the 
government and it figures to create at least as much controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Applications were submitted recently to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms to certify regions called Rutherford and Oakville. And within each of 
the areas, the applications seek approval for smaller regions called Rutherford 
Bench and Oakville Bench. 
</P>
<P>
It is Rutherford Bench that may cause problems, say growers and wineries, who 
say defining the boundaries of just what is benchland and what is not is at the 
heart of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
For years, wine lovers have heard there is a special quality to Cabernet 
Sauvignons of the Rutherford area, and an even more special quality to 
Cabernets of the Rutherford Bench. But until now no one has known precisely 
where the boundaries of this "bench" are located. 
</P>
<P>
Said Phyllis Van Kriedt, writing in the California Wineletter, "The filing . . 
. is already causing plenty of controversy in the (Napa) Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Decanter, a respected London-based wine magazine, has presented its Man of the 
Year award to Robert Mondavi of the Napa Valley. Mondavi is the first 
California wine maker to receive the honor. 
</P>
<P>
The first to win the award, in 1984, was Serge Hochar of Chateau Musar in 
Lebanon. In subsequent years, the awards went to Laura and Corinne 
Mentzelopoulos, owners of Chateau Margaux in Bordeaux; Piero Antinori, one of 
Italy's leading wine makers; Alexis Lichine, owner of Chateau Prieure-Lichine 
and a wine author, and Max Schubert, creator of one of Australia's greatest 
wines, Penfolds Grange Hermitage.

A VARIETY OF WINES NOW AVAILABLE FOR PASSOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY ZEIDLER, Zeidler is a free-lance writer and cookbook author. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wine is an important part of the observance of Passover (April 20 through April 
27); at least four cups are poured during the seder service. I'm sure we have 
all noticed how wines have changed since our childhoods, when only sweet syrupy 
kosher wines were available. 
</P>
<P>
This year at the seder table, our family and friends may choose from a wide 
variety of kosher Passover wines, not only from California but from Israel, 
Italy and France. Among them are sweet and dry wines -- red, white and rose in 
many popular varietals -- Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rieslings. You 
will find many to choose from in markets and wine stores; even sparkling wines 
and Champagnes are available. All Passover wines are marked with a special seal 
and signed by the local rabbinical authority. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the ceremonial uses of wine, you'll find wine to be a great way to liven 
up Passover menus. Used in cooking and baking, it makes a welcome substitute 
for the many seasonings, spices and sauces that are not permitted during the 
eight days of Passover. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, when you cook or bake with wine, the alcohol evaporates and only the 
flavor and aroma remain, so you may serve the food to everybody in the family. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes I'm sharing are not intended as a menu. You may not want to serve 
all of them at one seder or Passover dinner, but used creatively, they will add 
interest to holiday menus. Included is a California charoset developed for our 
family seder. It contains only fruits, nuts and wine grown and produced in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Chopped Liver Terrine contains wine, chicken livers, apples, mushrooms and 
chopped eggs. It makes a delicious appetizer served with matzo. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Beet and Horseradish Sauce that's great with gefilte fish or with 
my recipe for Whitefish in White Wine. This whitefish is another family 
specialty. It combines both broiling and poaching at the same time; the result 
is fish that is lightly browned, but still tender and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite main course is Lamb Shanks Roasted in Red Wine, which gives the 
shanks a most delicious, robust flavor. The same recipe works well with lamb or 
veal tongues. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, serve a sponge cake flavored with wine and spices, substituting 
ground nuts and Passover potato starch for the usual matzo meal or matzo cake 
flour. Or make Wine Custard Mousse using old-fashioned Concord grape wine. This 
is especially good with your favorite Passover cookies. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
GRANDMA'S PASSOVER 
</P>
<P>
SPONGE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
9 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
1 2/3 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Passover sweet red wine 
</P>
<P>
Grated zest of 1 orange 
</P>
<P>
1 cup Passover potato starch, sifted 
</P>
<P>
1/2 finely ground almonds 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg yolks and sugar until light in color and texture in bowl of electric 
mixer. Blend in wine and orange peel. Combine potato starch, almonds, ginger, 
nutmeg, cinnamon and salt. Add to egg yolk mixture, blending thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. (Do not overbeat; if you can turn bowl 
upside down, it's done.) Fold 1/4 of whites into egg yolk mixture to lighten 
batter. Add remaining whites and fold in gently but thoroughly until well 
blended. 
</P>
<P>
Pour batter into ungreased 10-inch tube pan with removable bottom. Bake at 350 
degrees 45 minutes or until wood pick inserted in center comes out dry. Remove 
cake from oven and immediately invert pan. Cool cake. Loosen sides and center 
of cake with sharp knife and unmold onto cake plate. Frost with chocolate 
frosting. Serve with Wine Custard Mousse. Makes 10 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Frosting 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons unsalted margarine or oil 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons honey 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Passover Concord grape wine, strong coffee or orange juice 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces semisweet Passover chocolate 
</P>
<P>
In small saucepan combine margarine, honey and water. Bring to boil, remove 
from heat and add chocolate. Beat until stiff enough to spread or drizzle over 
cake. Makes about 1 cup. 
</P>
<P>
Wine Custard Mousse 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup Passover sweet wine 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup water 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
Place egg yolks in top of double boiler. Add 1/2 cup sugar and beat with wire 
whisk until pale yellow and creamy. Place top of double boiler over simmering 
water over low heat. Beat half of sweet wine into egg yolk mixture 1 minute. 
Gradually beat in remaining wine. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce heat to very low. Continue cooking over gently simmering water. Beat 
constantly and scrap bottom and sides of pan frequently until mixture is fluffy 
and thick enough to form soft mounds when dropped from whisk, about 5 minutes. 
Do not overcook or it will curdle. Remove top of double boiler from water 
immediately. Whisk custard briefly, pour into bowl and chill. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites with salt using wire whisk until soft peaks form. Add remaining 
1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Mix about 1/2 cup meringue into 
cooled custard to lighten it and continue folding in remaining meringue. Cover 
with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Makes about 4 servings.

LET'S EAT OUT: DOLORES': HIGH STANDARDS, LOW PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Dolores' Drive-In when it was on La Cienega and Wilshire and 
miniskirted waitresses slid your hamburgers onto a tray hooked to the car 
window? Remember the ridiculously low prices? 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Z sauce and JJ double-decker burger (the three-decker burger, 
which, claims owner Izzy Freeman, was copied outright by the McDonald's and 
Bob's Big Boy people)? 
</P>
<P>
Well, miniskirted waitresses, whom one always associates with roller skates, 
thanks to Hollywood renditions of Dolores' skaters in movies, also are gone, 
and so is the drive-in concept, thanks to an ordinance prohibiting drive-ins in 
Beverly Hills. But at the old Dolores' (relocated on Olympic Boulevard), the 
menu, taste, JJ burger and Z sauce have been caught in a time warp. So have the 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, paying my bill at the end of one overstuffed, gluttonous sampling meal 
provided a moment of pure pleasure. It was like winning a 10-to-one shot at the 
horse races, or hitting the $100 jackpot on a Las Vegas slot machine. 
</P>
<P>
The bill for two persons, which included a Dolores' hamburger (ugly 
burger-stand yellow-paper wrapper not withstanding), a small bowl of terrific 
chili, fresh Suzy Q potatoes (you know the on-going spiraly kind you can wire a 
house with), assorted grilled fish plate that came with a soup or salad, two 
gorgeous homemade soft dinner rolls, an eggplant patty without the wheat bun, a 
hot fudge sundae and hot deep-dish apple pie with vanilla ice cream, amounted 
to $14.95. Or something ridiculous like that. With tax added yet. 
</P>
<P>
You'll want to reacquaint yourself with Dolores' if you are on a fixed income, 
or just nostalgic for the good old days when dining out was much, much, much 
more simple -- and less costly. 
</P>
<P>
I am not talking about haute cuisine, mind you. But you will get a meal that is 
generally far more varied and probably a lot tastier than most people are 
capable of cooking themselves in these days of no-cook home cooks. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared, however, for a few hiccup-y protests from the digestive system 
when it comes to some of the saucy stuff (like the sauce in the eggplant 
Parmigiana, which seemed to me to be thick enough to replaster an entire room). 
But that's the fun of it. You don't want everything precisely right when you 
dine '50s style. You want the fries to be slightly greasy, the hamburgers chewy 
and the chili thick and gooey. 
</P>
<P>
You don't go to Dolores' for fat-free, low-sodium, rock-bottom-cholesterol 
dining, although there are several things, like the soups (split pea, Navy 
bean, minestrone, clam chowder and beef vegetable), the tuna and chef's salads 
and the omelets, among others on the menu, that will assure some semblance of 
nutritional sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, a Dolores' pit stop is the stuff of the growing boys and girls who 
love to dig in and enjoy before middle-age guilt, penance and atonement sets in 
to spoil eating pleasure, if not life itself. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is a lot to choose from, considering the simplicity of the 
menu. Breakfast is served from 6 to 11 a.m. daily and until 2 p.m. and after 7 
p.m. only on Saturday and Sunday. The breakfast menu alone will make you want 
to skate over to Dolores': corned beef hash, Belgian waffles ($1.95 plain), the 
San Francisco omelet made with spinach and eggs scrambled with sauteed onions 
and Romano cheese -- a stevedore's meal in itself. Dirt cheap, too: $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburgers are served without accoutrements, but you can certainly ask for side 
orders. Patty and tuna melts, open face, and the JJ double-decker ($2.95) with 
everything on them also are still good. Chili -- a very, very good one too -- 
is chock-full of meat morsels and is served straight by the bowl or cup, with 
or without beans. A bowl is only $4.25. Chili-to-go by the gallonful is also 
available at $38.75, with crackers, cheese and onions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homemade Breads 
</P>
<P>
If you've forgotten what a barbecue-style sandwich is like, try one on 
sourdough or bun from the bakery on the premises. The breads and pastries, in 
fact, are the best of their type I've had in a long time. Rolls, pie crust, 
heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner suggestions include old-fashioned favorites that were on Dolores' menu 
when it started out in 1944: hamburger steak, grilled liver and onions (which 
is fast becoming extinct on any restaurant menu), deep-fried fish or shrimp, 
baked fettuccine with mushroom sauce and a spinach casserole topped with two 
poached eggs. If you like the idea of eggplant for a vegetarian dinner entree, 
the eggplant Palermo with pasta will keep you and your purse way under budget 
($4.95). 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to leave room for some deep-dish pie ($1.65) or sundae ($2.65). Or 
both. I know I will. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores' Drive-In, 8925 W. Olympic Blvd., Beverly Hills. (213) 655-7920. Open 
24 hours daily. No reservations. No checks or credit cards. Parking lot. 
Average dinner entree $5. Take-out chili by the gallon; whole pies and 16 
ounces sauces, soups, potato salad and cole slaw also available to go.

USEFUL TIPS ON BANANAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some useful tips on bananas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bananas will ripen more quickly if placed in a brown paper bag and held at 
room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Banana garnish: Run the prongs of a fork lengthwise down a peeled banana 
then slice crosswise for dainty crinkly edged rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coat sliced banana for salads with lemon juice to keep from browning. 
Orange or pineapple juice is also good and adds a pleasant flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Toast thick banana bread slices and top with peanut butter and jelly for a 
quick breakfast with a glass of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freeze a banana in its peel. Thaw slightly, peel and slice into dessert 
dish and drizzle with a teaspoon of maple syrup. A wonderful low-calorie 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bananas pack easily in brown-bag lunches. They come in their own wrapping 
and need no further preparation.

CASSEROLES MADE EASY; 
</P>
<P>
SAVING MANY STEPS IN ONE-STEP MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY BYAL, Food Editor, Better Homes and Gardens Magazine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One-dish dinners save you time on every step from menu planning to cleanup. 
Here are some tips to make casseroles even easier. 
</P>
<P>
Buy Ingredients the Way You Use Them 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loosepack frozen vegetables; preshredded cheese; boneless chicken breasts 
or frozen cooked chicken, cubed; precooked sausages; cooked canned garbanzo, 
pinto and kidney beans can help save time in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Make Use of the Microwave 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook chopped onion, celery and green pepper, covered, in margarine or water 
in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook ground beef in the microwave. Drain well before combining with other 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook pasta and rice on the range top while vegetables and sauces cook in 
the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Try giving your favorite casseroles their final cooking in the microwave. 
Cook, covered, on 100% power (HIGH) for about one-fourth to one-third of the 
oven baking time. Check for doneness, turn, and add cooking time 2 minutes at a 
time. Add cheese or crumb toppings when the casserole is done. 
</P>
<P>
Fixing for the Freezer 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use converted rice in casseroles destined for the freezer. It retains a 
firm texture even after freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook pasta for freezer casseroles just until it's almost tender. Rinse it 
with cold water to halt the cooking. It will finish cooking when you bake the 
frozen casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't settle for a square of foil over the top of a casserole intended for 
the freezer. Overwrap completely with heavy-duty foil to keep air and moisture 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep baking dishes free for cooking, wrap make-ahead recipes this way: 
Cut a length of heavy-duty foil three times the width or diameter of the dish. 
Line the dish with the foil. Add the food and cool. Bring the longer sides of 
the foil together over the food. Fold down the foil, pressing air out, until 
the foil is next to the food. Fold down shorter sides. Freeze until firm; then 
lift out the wrapped food. Label and store in the freezer. When you're ready to 
reheat, remove the foil and return the frozen food to the original dish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the recipe includes an acid ingredient such as a tomato product, wrap 
the food first in clear plastic wrap, then overwrap with foil. Remove the 
plastic wrap before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freeze casseroles up to three months. Label and date each package when you 
freeze it. 
</P>
<P>
Ingredient Substitutions 
</P>
<P>
 -- For thickening, 2 tablespoons flour equal 1 tablespoon cornstarch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 3/4 cup tomato paste plus 1 cup water equals 2 cups tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1/2 cup tomato sauce plus 1/2 cup water equals 1 cup tomato juice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 tablespoon prepared mustard equals 1 teaspoon dry mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 teaspoon onion powder or 1 tablespoon dried minced onion equals one small 
onion. 
</P>
<P>
Potlucks 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep a casserole hot until you reach a potluck dinner, wrap it in foil 
or a heavy towel and place it in a plastic-foam container. Pack the casserole 
as soon as you take it from the oven.

REGRADING DELAYS NEW POST OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A post office that officials say will improve mail service in Eagle Rock and 
Highland Park is still unopened six months after its scheduled completion date 
because its parking lots must be regraded, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the project has been stalled since September, when the U.S. Postal 
Service says it discovered that the lots were too steep. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the service has replaced the architect who designed the $7.9-million 
building. The sleek, nearly finished structure at Figueroa Street and Colorado 
Boulevard in Eagle Rock is sitting empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Architects Blamed 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service attributed the problem to the architectural company, 
McCulloch Architects of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The parking lots as designed had excessive grades, which exceeded L.A. city 
codes," Denny Roush, a Los Angeles construction manager for the Postal Service, 
said Wednesday. "It was not the fault of the contractor. It was the design." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that postal officials approved the plans in advance but said 
they didn't realize there was a problem until last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Christiansen, project manager for the contractor, Vanir-Campbell Co. of 
Sacramento, said his company told the Postal Service about the design problem 
in November, 1987, but was ignored. Postal officials denied this. 
</P>
<P>
Architects in the firm did not return phone calls after messages were left with 
a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The regrading involves several other jobs, officials said. Los Angeles 
officials said it may require additional support structures to bolster 
neighboring Figueroa Street. Fuel pumps for postal vehicles have to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Also, postal officials said the parking lot's exit is too close to a street 
corner for vehicles to pull into traffic safely and must be moved. 
</P>
<P>
The delay has attracted the attention of a congressman and a city councilman, 
both of whom are demanding information about it. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lots are on a 10% grade, twice as steep as city ordinances allow. 
Under the law, federal buildings do not have to adhere to local building codes, 
although the Postal Service said its policy is to obey them. 
</P>
<P>
To regrade the lot, workers will have to start from scratch, tearing out the 
lot and the retaining wall that surrounds it. The workers will have to rebury 
sewer and water lines at the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The 32,000-square-foot building is needed to handle mail in Eagle Rock and 
neighboring Highland Park. The volume is more than twice as large today as it 
was 10 years ago. The new post office will bring faster delivery and shorter 
lines, official say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planned as Replacement 
</P>
<P>
It will replace a tiny post office on Eagle Rock Boulevard that has been there 
since 1952. The Highland Park Post Office, on North Figueroa Street, will 
remain open but will be used only for mail collection, postal service spokesman 
David Mazer said. The combined size of the two existing post offices is less 
than a third that of the new facility. Also, they have no parking for employees 
or customers. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear when new building will open. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes Eagle Rock, has 
asked the U.S. postmaster general to explain what went wrong. City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre has called for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Postal Service is trying to get construction moving again. 
</P>
<P>
A San Pedro firm has been hired to design parking lots. The service expects to 
choose a contractor next week to do the work, the cost of which is unknown, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been waiting there a long time for a new post office," Mazer said. 
"They're going to be happy when it's open, and they're going to be happier that 
it's safe."

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: THE STUDENTS HAVE TRIED HIM OVER AND OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen Marshall High School students will assemble in a Sacramento Superior 
Court today to grapple over the guilt or innocence of a fellow student who got 
caught up in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
They'll argue that high school dropout Chris Willow had a First Amendment right 
to distribute an alternative newspaper in which she wrote: "I found the answer 
to all your problems. . . . It's CRACK," and "Come talk to me in my 'office' 
next to Sandra's Pizza Place on Thursday around 7:30 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
They'll argue that it was humor, not an inducement to buy drugs, and that it 
proved nothing when Willow was later arrested for selling drugs outside 
Sandra's Pizza Place. 
</P>
<P>
Then they'll turn around and argue just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Willow is convicted or not is really inconsequential. The youth is a 
fictitious character created by the Constitutional Rights Foundation as the 
subject for the annual California State Mock Trial Competition. By winning the 
city title for the second year in a row, Marshall qualified for another shot at 
the state championship, which barely slipped away last year. If the team does 
well today, it will move on to the finals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, instructors David Tokofsky and Claire Goldblum have been leading 
the team through a rigorous examination into Chris Willow's case and the 
constitutional law that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
The students have tried her over and over. Last Thursday afternoon they did it 
one last time in a kind of dress rehearsal without the dress. 
</P>
<P>
The judge was the bearded Tokofsky. He wore a green polo shirt and jeans and 
lounged at a student desk set front and center in his classroom under the 
steady eyes of all the American Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
He issued orders such as: 
</P>
<P>
"Could we please have a bailiff at the door to discourage mobile student 
units?" 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys sat at a table facing him. Defense attorney Arisa Mattson wore 
blue shorts with white polka dots and T-shirt. Prosecutor Ana Liza Fulay wore a 
print skirt and tank top. 
</P>
<P>
The jury sat to their right, 10 teachers who stayed after school. 
</P>
<P>
They listened to a blistering cross examination of defense witness Jody Sills, 
a teacher being played by student Shira Myrow. 
</P>
<P>
According to the case notes, provided by the sponsors, Sills was "tired of 
seeing good kids like Chris Willow completely ignored and abused by this school 
system." 
</P>
<P>
She was called to tell what she saw the afternoon the vice principal kicked 
Willow off campus for distributing her newspaper and then informed the police. 
</P>
<P>
The notes said Sills could "see and hear everything that was going on." 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutor picked that notion apart. She did so by taking advantage of 
the rules allowing the witness to state no facts except those gleaned from the 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Sills," Fulay said, in a sharp aggressive tone, "why did she have to call 
the police if Chris did not leave?" 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know." 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't hear that part?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't hear everything that was said that evening?" 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I missed that." 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't see everything that happened below, did you? It was Chris' voice 
that attracted you to the window?" 
</P>
<P>
That raised an objection. 
</P>
<P>
"She's asking a compound question," Mattson snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Fulay rephrased the question. 
</P>
<P>
"So you didn't see Chris when she first arrived?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't tell us what Chris was giving these students when she did arrive?" 
</P>
<P>
"Um, not when she first arrived, no." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you. No further questions." In closing, Fulay argued that the newspaper 
was an advertisement for drugs rather than legitimate commentary. She reviewed 
the testimony of Willow who said she wasn't thinking when she ran reflexively 
from Officer Dana Allen and threw a notebook in the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
"She was thinking," Fulay asserted. "She was trying to escape. The only reflex 
was a well-developed criminal reflex." 
</P>
<P>
The defense used the prosecution's own evidence -- that Sandra's Pizza Place 
was a common drug trafficking spot -- to cast doubt on the contention that the 
bag of cocaine found near the notebook had fallen out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Mattson characterized the newspaper article as juvenile hyperbole. Anyone 
familiar with teen-age humor would know it was all a joke, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury rendered both a verdict and a critique. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was 8-2 for acquittal. The jurors thought the prosector harsh in 
her comment on the youth's "well-developed criminal reflex." They were 
impressed by the point that the bag of cocaine in the bushes could have 
belonged to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
The critique got down to fine points. The teachers didn't catch the prosecutor 
saying "evening" when she meant "afternoon." But they did notice that Officer 
Allen was sometimes "he" and sometimes "she." 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys confessed. It turned out that the boy who was playing Dana Allen 
was sick. A girl took his place. The confusion that followed was an object 
lesson: 
</P>
<P>
Even after months of practice in the high plane of Constitutional law and 
courtroom procedure, the tiniest detail can unravel a case. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Marshall attorneys will be in proper courtroom attire. And they'll 
try to remember who is a boy and who is a girl.

MEMORIAL GARDEN WILL MARK THE SPOT WHERE 4 WERE KILLED BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale officials and volunteers are working together to create a $16,000 
memorial garden for four people killed in July by a suspected drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the garden will be a median divider at the north fork of Verdugo 
Road and Canada Boulevard, where the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Nello Iacono, Glendale parks director, said a private fund will be set up to 
accept donations for plants. Plans for the project, which was approved by the 
Division of Parks, Recreation and Community Services, were drawn by James 
DeRouen, 45, an architectural designer, and Sandra Fiorenza, 27, a landscape 
architect. Both are Glendale residents who volunteered their services. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously voted the money Tuesday to landscape the 
6,500-square-foot median, but Iacono said accepting private donations will 
"allow the community to participate." 
</P>
<P>
The city will finance the garden's creation and be reimbursed by the private 
donations earmarked for the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
DeRouen said that as he drove to his office in Montrose on July 13, he passed 
through the intersection moments after five members of two families waiting on 
the median strip were struck by an out-of-control car. He said it was a scene 
that he will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
"There were bodies all over the place," DeRouen said. He appeared before the 
City Council several days later to ask that a memorial be established for the 
victims. Only one victim survived. 
</P>
<P>
Fiorenza said she was traumatized by news accounts of the tragedy. She said she 
contacted DeRouen after learning of his proposal to establish a memorial. "I 
just wanted to do something," she said, adding, "the hearts of everyone here" 
go out to the surviving families. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Cramer, 32; her daughter Brianna, 9; Patricia Carr, 36, and her 
daughter Karen, 6, were waiting on the median divider after a stroll about 8:30 
p.m. when a speeding car struck them on the unprotected island, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Cramer, 12, the only survivor, said during a preliminary hearing in 
January that he saw the car coming and threw himself flat before he could yell 
a warning. He suffered a broken finger and an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driver out on Bail 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, William K. Conway, 27, is free on bail pending a trial 
scheduled to begin May 5 in Pasadena Superior Court. A part-time city 
maintenance worker, Conway is charged with four counts of manslaughter and one 
count of causing an accident with injuries while driving under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The city has since installed guard rails to protect pedestrians on the island 
and changed traffic signals to slow approaching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaping on the median will feature four varieties of pink floribunda rose 
bushes, each representing one of the victims, Iacono said. Pink-flowering India 
hawthorn bushes will be planted to camouflage guard rails, with verbena and 
star jasmine as ground cover. The city also plans to install a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Iacono said work is expected to begin within a month and be completed by the 
end of May.

WOO CALLS REELECTION MARGIN 'STRONG MANDATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilman Michael Woo, easily winning reelection in Tuesday's 
municipal primary, described his victory as a "strong mandate" for his programs 
in the 13th District, but his leading opponent attributed Woo's showing to low 
voter turnout rather than voter satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, whose district extends from Silver Lake to Sherman Oaks and takes in 
Hollywood and much of the Hollywood Hills, said his win was an endorsement from 
voters of his efforts to control development, manage traffic and fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the results," said Woo, who won the seat in 1985 by 
beating then-Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson in a runoff election. "We ran a 
textbook campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Berndt Lohr-Schmidt, who emerged during the final weeks of the race as Woo's 
No. 1 challenger, was clearly disappointed in his distant second-place finish. 
According to unofficial results, Woo collected roughly 70% of the votes -- 
about 13,800 -- compared to 16%, or about 3,200, for Lohr-Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Schmidt had been predicting that he would force Woo into a runoff 
election, which is required when no candidate receives more than 50% of the 
vote. Only one of the eight council members seeking reelection citywide -- 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi from the San Fernando Valley -- will face a runoff 
challenge in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected more votes," Lohr-Schmidt said. "Just from the people I talked to. 
I talked to more than 3,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
Woo spent election evening at his campaign headquarters in Hollywood, 
abandoning earlier plans to watch the late returns from the city clerk's 
election center at City Hall. Lohr-Schmidt arrived at City Hall late Tuesday 
night after holding a campaign party in Hollywood with about 100 of his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Race 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Schmidt, waging his first political campaign, said that during the race he 
detected "a growing base of opposition" to Woo that was not reflected in the 
election results. "If he interprets this as a mandate, he is missing the boat," 
Lohr-Schmidt said. "What sort of mandate do you get from 13,000 votes out of 
90,000 registered voters? He has managed to put everybody to sleep. It is our 
job to wake everybody up. We only had three months to do that. Now we have four 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Kayser, who finished third with about 9% of the vote, sounded a more 
conciliatory tone. Kayser, who also ran in 1985, said he was disappointed by 
the low voter turnout -- 23% citywide -- but credited Woo with waging an 
effective campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to have success in the betterment of the 13th District, I 
think it is important that we all try to work together," Kayser said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to contact Woo "and offer whatever I can to work with his 
office. . . . You can't stay mad all of your life. At least I can't stay mad 
all of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The other two challengers, Venus De Milo and Zahrina Machadah, polled about 3% 
and 1% of the vote, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Textbook Campaign' 
</P>
<P>
Woo attributed his success to his "textbook campaign," which identified likely 
voters and relied on extensive precinct walking, telephone banks, campaign 
coffees and targeted mailings. During the final week of the campaign, for 
example, he mailed a series of letters to various parts of his district, 
including a five-page piece to hillside residents discussing everything from 
his opposition to covering the Lake Hollywood reservoir to his views on 
Hollywood redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Woo also made it difficult for his four opponents to get a piece of the action 
by largely ignoring them -- he refused to debate them and didn't even bother to 
place campaign placards in the district. He also was able to heavily outspend 
them. Woo collected about $275,000 in campaign contributions, and spent 
$225,000 of it through March 25. Lohr-Schmidt led the four challengers in fund 
raising with about $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is under-financed by 10 to 1 and is still able to win 16% of the 
vote, I think it says something to Mike Woo," Lohr-Schmidt said. "It tells him 
to watch out. We will be watching him." 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Schmidt, a Harvard-educated attorney who lives in the Hollywood Hills, 
first got interested in the council job after butting heads with Woo last year 
over the councilman's proposed restrictions on hillside building. As a leader 
of the Hillside Property Owners Assn., Lohr-Schmidt testified against the 
restrictions at several City Hall hearings, arguing that they would unfairly 
punish owners of undeveloped lots. Lohr-Schmidt and his wife, Elaine Kohn, own 
several dozen hillside lots that would be affected by the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Woo has argued that the restrictions, recently approved by the council's 
Planning and Environment Committee, are necessary because overbuilding in the 
hills has created safety hazards. Woo's stance won him praise from the city's 
police, firefighter and paramedic unions, all of which endorsed his reelection 
bid. He also had strong support from several hillside homeowner groups that had 
been pushing for restrictions.

TODAY, THE SWEETEST LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS PICK THE MOST VILE, GROSS AND 
DISGUSTING TOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to the contemporary kingdom of "Toy land, toy land, little girl and boy 
land. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Where, in an "evil pit of gruesome ooze . . . horrible goop turns trapped 
warriors into Slime monsters." (Slime included.) 
</P>
<P>
Where, with the Mad Scientist Dissect-An-Alien kit with plastic scalpel, 
youngsters can "yank out alien organs dripping with flowing alien blood!" 
(Warning: Alien blood sticks to fabrics and hair and is impervious to dry 
cleaning). 
</P>
<P>
Where, with a Nintendo and a Millipede game, boys and girls can get "lost in a 
dark, perilous and enchanted forest (where) dark dangerous mushrooms push up 
through the squishy forest floor, snaring you on every side. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Where, taking aim with their Glooper Game gun, children can "fire globs of 
oozing, slimy gloop up to 25 feet!" (Goop comes in easy-to-load cartridges). 
</P>
<P>
Where, by depressing the plunger on Gooper Ghost's backpack -- which comes with 
twin Nutrona Blasters -- youngsters can make him ooze purple Ecto-Plazm kisses. 
</P>
<P>
And they can do it all while munching Boogers, a gummy green candy that has 
spawned its own cult humor, as in: "What's the difference between school books 
and boogers? You put your school books on top of the table." 
</P>
<P>
Guns have peaked, ditto high-priced talking dolls and animals. Barbie, who just 
turned 30, was never more popular, with Mattel expecting 1989 sales to surpass 
1988's 40 million worldwide. And gross, it seems, is always good in the selling 
of toys. 
</P>
<P>
"The more the parents scream, the more the kids want it," said Tom Berquist, a 
Connecticut-based idea man who brought "Boogers" to Confex candy company in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call it a trend," said Bruce Apar, editor of Toy and Hobby World in 
New York, of the proliferation of gross on toy shelves. Because the toy 
business is a low entry-level business, he explained, it is easy for someone 
struck by inspiration to market something that is "either tasteless or totally 
inappropriate" as a new toy. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, he noted, these come from companies that "come out of 
obscurity and usually go back in, and justifiably so." Many, he added, never 
make their way into stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Hall of Shame' 
</P>
<P>
From his "Hall of Shame" folder Apar culled a sampling: A "Brat on Board" doll, 
face contorted, designed to look as though it's hanging out a car window. Marty 
Toy Co.'s genuine replica of Freddy's Glove from "A Nightmare on Elm Street," 
complete with plastic blades extending from the fingers. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing inherently unwholesome in ooey, gooey, slimy toys, said Dr. 
Jerome Karasic, a psychiatrist specializing in children and adolescents and a 
clinical associate psychiatry professor at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fondness for the dirty, the ugly, or whatever, the detestable, in 
the very young infant," he explained. "As the infant matures, he learns that 
it's not acceptable and gives up his fondness. The slimy, ooey, gooey toys are 
like a bad joke, or maybe a good joke. If it helps a child to express something 
inside, what could be wrong with it?" 
</P>
<P>
Grown-ups, recognizing the necessity for acceptable and hygienic behavior, 
react to a child's fondness for the dirty by saying, " 'Ugh! Yuck!' and the 
children quickly adopt those attitudes," Karasic said. Nevertheless, he 
observed, adults' own childhood attachments are not easily shaken: "Grown-ups 
sometimes like to go out in the garden and get mud on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sadistic Toy' 
</P>
<P>
"Threatening" toys are another matter, Karasic said. He includes in that 
category Freddy's Glove: "I don't think that glove has any place. I think it's 
a sadistic toy." 
</P>
<P>
The real trend from this year's Toy Fair, Apar said, was that "there were no 
trends, and there haven't been for a couple of years now. . . . There's nothing 
really distinguishing itself from the rest of the pack." 
</P>
<P>
The exception: Nintendo, which in 1988 sold 7 million playing machines and 32.5 
million video games. 
</P>
<P>
But, look for: "Trump, The Game," coming in May from Milton Bradley, the 
Monopoly people. The object is to be the player with the most money, a la New 
York real estate magnate Donald Trump. More Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action 
figures. Electronic baseball cards where the players talk to you. 
</P>
<P>
And a generous dollop of slime and ooze and blood and monsters. 
</P>
<P>
The Garbage Pail Kids craze, which started in 1985, is "pretty much finished" 
in the United States, said Norman Liss of Topps, its New York-based 
manufacturer. Now they're in Holland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and 
in France, where they are being marketed as "Les Crados." 
</P>
<P>
But, Liss said, Topps is bringing back Garbage Can-dy, which he described as "a 
miniature pail filled with pieces of candy in the shape of things you'd find in 
the garbage -- fish heads, old shoes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that toy land trends tend to be cyclical, with four years a "real long 
life" for most new toys, Liss said, "We have a product now called Dinosaurs 
Attack, in which dinosaurs go wild and attack people and eat them up . . . 
years ago we did Mars Attacks. Very similar." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Always Been In' 
</P>
<P>
As for gross, he said, "Gross has always been in with kids . . . I think gross 
will continue, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne-based Mattel, which gave the world The Mad Scientist series including 
the Monster Lab Set to make "gross skeleton and flesh monsters . . . then 
sizzle the flesh off their bones!" is no longer making that line, though it's 
still in stores. Mattel has entered the gross sweepstakes with "Soggy Boglins" 
sea monsters and Food Fighters action figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend in yucky toys seems to be just that," Mattel spokeswoman Candace 
Irving said. "A lot of them are on the market place for a short time and then 
they go away," whereas Barbie and Hot Wheels endure. 
</P>
<P>
For the uninitiated, Boglins are a family of grotesquely mutated, rubberlike 
hand puppets including the Slobster, which has eyes on stems, a snapping claw 
and gets "madder than a mermaid on a sand bar" if kept out of its aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
The Food Fighters line includes Private Pizza, described by Irving as "a piece 
of pizza with human traits -- eyes, nose arms, legs," a soldier in the war 
between the bad guys, the Refrigerator Rejects, and the good guys, the Kitchen 
Commandos. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the toy industry have questioned whether children should be encouraged 
to wage food fights but Irving dismisses the criticism: "This isn't meant to 
replicate kitchen or dining room behavior. This is just a silly, wacky toy. And 
children understand that." 
</P>
<P>
As for those "Boogers," sort of Gummy Bears gone soft, creator Berquist (who 
also gave the world granular bubblegum mixed with candy ants), said the idea 
popped up in dinner talk about "kids and why they get grossed out." 
</P>
<P>
"Boogers," now available in Los Angeles, debuted in the fall on the East Coast 
and, Berquist said, "It just literally blew right off the shelves, if you'll 
pardon the pun." 
</P>
<P>
Let parents scream, he said, but "Hey, let's let kids be kids." The typical 
response, he added, is, "It's gross. It's disgusting. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Berquist, 42, who once designed smoke alarms for General Electric and watches 
for Timex, compares "Boogers" and their "harmless fun" (at about 40 cents a 
package) with candy cigarettes, and figures "Boogers" is a wholesome product. 
</P>
<P>
"A kid's life is full of sanctions," he observed. "You can't do this, you can't 
do that. This is a way for him to exert his independence." 
</P>
<P>
Confex's John Sullivan acknowledged, "We have had one very large Southern 
California drug chain take a little exception to Boogers. . . . There's always 
some people who don't have a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
The people at Ultra Software Corp. in Illinois do. "Turn Your House Into a 
Sewer," promises their advertisement for a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
interactive video game for Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A $43.95 Quest 
</P>
<P>
Ultra spokeswoman Lynn Hejtmanek explained the sewer game, due in stores by 
early June at a suggested retail price of $43.95 and targeted at boys 8 to 15: 
"It follows the escapades of the four characters who are in search of their 
Ninja Master, Splinter" and trying to rescue television reporter April O'Neill 
and defeat the bad guy, Shredder. "The turtles live in the sewers." 
</P>
<P>
Jodi Levine, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America in New York, 
suggested that Inhumanoids and Ghostbusters (very hot) and their ilk 
notwithstanding, "the trend has been away" from gross toys. But, she said, kids 
grow up fast and "certainly gross will be back shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she noted, what sells best -- besides Nintendo -- is preschool 
stuff, board games, dolls, match box toys, "basically the kind of stuff you and 
I played with as kids. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Levine explained that "young parents want to know the kid is going to like (the 
toy) past the birthday, past Christmas. Most of the things in the gross 
category would almost be considered novelties." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that stuffed animal sales are down 40% but "I don't think that means 
that all of a sudden people hate teddy bears." Rather, she said, it reflects a 
resurgence in dolls and a spurt for board games. "The bottom line is that total 
retail sales are about the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Demographically, there aren't that many more kids in the world." 
</P>
<P>
What happens when a respectable company like Integ of San Jose, creator of the 
new and educational, "JC, The Junior Computer" and family-oriented basketball 
and football Action Mat Games, comes up with a novelty alarm clock that looks 
like a bundle of dynamite and "explodes" instead of buzzing? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for one thing, it comes under attack from Toy and Hobby World's Apar, who 
considers the idea "offensive. A rather strange toy. . . . With terrorism 
rampant, I'd think the last toy a parent would want their child to have is an 
alarm clock that looks like a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
But Integ defends the Dynamite Alarm Clock ($49.95) as a humorous takeoff on 
the old gag, "It takes an earthquake or an act of Congress to get her/him up in 
the morning." In English, French or Spanish, the clock tells the snoozer, "You 
have 20 seconds to get up," then begins a countdown. At the end, there is an 
explosion-like sound. 
</P>
<P>
Integ President Ted Wong, informed of the criticism, said, "The last thing we 
would intend the product to do is to even hint that it might promote something 
like (terrorism). We have always looked at it merely as a comical type 
situation." Now, he said, he plans "a complete re-evaluation" of the product 
before deciding whether to introduce it this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Goop and Glop' 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, let others deal in ooze, says Sarah Englander of LJN Toys, creator 
of Entertech's The Glooper Game. "Right now we're just into straight water. No 
goop and glop (though) I think the boys are still into major slime." 
</P>
<P>
Coming soon from LJN: Non-threatening water guns molded into characters, 
including a gorilla on a surfboard. Of course, Englander said, "We're doing a 
lot of 'Friday the 13th,' but I don't think that's out of the ordinary 
revolting." 
</P>
<P>
Kenner is discontinuing its Bone Age series featuring dinosaur bones that can 
be rearranged to build launchers and jet fighters and attack cars, but, 
spokeswoman Carol Varnas said, the company will play the game of gross with The 
Real Ghostbusters Fearsome Flush, which she described: "It's a toilet. It has 
wheels. As you roll it, the seat of the toilet opens and a tongue comes out and 
then the top of the toilet tank opens and two eyes pop out." 
</P>
<P>
Also added to the Ghostbusters line will be classic monsters, including a 
mummy. Said Varnas, "You press his arm and his head pops off and then he'll 
begin to unravel. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Yuckiness isn't as bad as tastelessness," said Ann Brown, chair of the 
Consumer Affairs Committee, Americans for Democratic Action, which each year 
evaluates new toys. "Slime and ooze are yucky. Then there's something that's 
tasteless, that preys on kids. That's a whole different thing." 
</P>
<P>
In testing toys for quality and safety, Brown said, "You have to walk a thin 
line. You can't just use grown-up standards for taste for kids or you risk 
being called a purist or a prig. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are fascinated with anal things at certain stages, oral at others. You 
just have to accept that. But it's a shame that grown-up manufacturers take 
advantage of this to sell kids. Kids believe truly in toys." 
</P>
<P>
ADA's 1988 toy report concluded of Mattel's "Boglins" that "toys that may 
appear repulsive or worthless to parents are sometimes funny or useful to kids 
in getting rid of their fears." Of Entertech's Glooper gun, the report said, 
"We can only assume that there was a surplus of 'slime' left over from some 
other toy line, and they had to find a way to sell it. This is a truly horrible 
toy." 
</P>
<P>
Mattel's "Mad Scientist" line got the ADA "trash box" rating. It found 
Dissect-An-Alien not merely gross and disgusting but, more important, boring. 
Of "Monster Lab" it concluded: "You really have to be mad (as in crazy) to buy 
this toy." 
</P>
<P>
As for "Boogers," Brown said in an interview, "I think . . . that is truly 
tasteless. I don't think there's any justification for that. It doesn't help a 
kid come to terms with the world. It doesn't do anything but put some dough in 
a manufacturer's pocket."

For an old, handmade oil lamp, Catherine Smith of Sherman Oaks needs ribbon

Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Two readers are somewhat out of focus this week. 
Olive at (213) 596-6437 needs a 16mm editing-splicing machine, and Bob at (818) 
288-4186 is looking for a sprocket adapter for an Airquipt Festival slide

Bill O'Brien of La Habra, who wanted a magazine catchall that hangs on a wall, 
will no longer be up the wall. A. Cunningham of San Juan Capistrano says she 
bought one of these from Dansk Products, Cohoe Center, Route 5, Enfield, Conn. 
06082. And an Arcadia reader said she would be happy to make one for O'Brien; 
if he (or anybody else among our readers) is interested, please let us know. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Seims of La Canada and Fran Crowell of Long Beach, both of whom were 
looking for potato ricers, should soon become spud-niks. Martha Ferreira of 
Rowland Heights says Cookin' Stuff, 350 W. Whittier Blvd., La Habra, (213) 
691-0470, carries several ricers, in addition to numerous other kitchen 
gadgets; they will also try to find items that are no longer manufactured, 
Ferreira says. Reader N. Reuben says a kitchen store in the Farmers Market on 
Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles has carried it. Frank Johnson of the White 
Elephant, 3422 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank, (818) 842-0721, says they sometimes 
carry ricers; he also suggests Avery's, 901 E. 2nd St., Los Angeles, (213) 
624-7832, as a place that carries every kitchen item imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Mildred Smith of Yucaipa says Lechter's, a kitchen-gadget shop at 
Inland Mall in San Bernardino, (714) 889-4530, carries an assortment of these 
potato ricers. In addition, half a dozen readers said they have ricers that 
they wouldn't mind parting with; a stamped, self-addressed envelope will surely 
squeeze these names out of us. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Peter of Hollywood, who wanted bedspreads with stars that glow in the 
dark, should soon be in heaven. Helen Price and J. Mounce of Burbank both say 
to try any K mart; the pattern is called Comets. Michael D. Batchelor of 
Riverside says he bought such a bedspread a year ago at a Target store in 
Riverside. And Elizabeth Urman of Westminster says the Lillian Vernon 
catalogue, 510 S. Fulton Ave., Mt. Vernon, N.Y. 10550, features the spreads for 
$21.95 a set. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Davey of Northridge, who wanted a clear-plastic bubble umbrella, has been 
joined in her search by Shelley Morgan of Culver City and Debbie Miles of 
Hawthorne (who heard that some Boston Stores far from her might have a few). 
We'd hate to rain on anybody's parade, but so far the only sources we've found 
are two readers who would be willing to open up their hearts and fold their 
ownership of plastic umbrellas. If our three searchers are still interested in 
being in the clear, a stamped, self-addressed envelope would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
For Elizabeth Perreault of Hollywood, who wants plastic covers for custom-made 
shoes, Caroline Bales of Alhambra has this advice: Don't enclose leather shoes 
in plastic; they need to breathe. If you must cover them, get plastic shoe 
boxes or use the small plastic bags that groceries come in.

CONSUMER VIEWS: ON ITS FACE, THE POLICY LOOKS OUTDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Last year I bought some expensive life insurance from a man I 
trusted. When the policy came, I thought there was a mistake. The policy was 
largely unrelated to what I had been told. I said I would return the policy for 
a refund of my large premium ($5,000), but they wouldn't refund it. To my 
amazement, the law lets you return policies, after seeing them, only if the 
face amount is under $10,000 -- that's right, $10,000! It must have been 
written during the Depression. I spent 6 hours preparing a fully documented 
complaint to the insurance commissioner, but they just told me to see a lawyer. 
I am a lawyer! The commissioner was worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Please try to get that stupid $10,000 limit removed, and warn your readers to 
demand to see a policy before paying the premium! -- R.G. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, indeed, at least on the second advice: Read before paying the 
premium. But there's another step before that, according to David Langenbacher, 
the Los Angeles-based chief of the underwriting service bureau for the state's 
department of insurance. Before you even let the policy hit your hands, make 
sure that it contains a 10-day (minimum) "free-look" clause. 
</P>
<P>
That $10,000 maximum refers to the fact that any life insurance policy with a 
face value no greater than that must contain the free-look provision -- return 
it within 10 days of receipt and you can get your premium back. 
</P>
<P>
And Langenbacher is in full agreement with you: That $10,000 maximum is, 
indeed, "hopelessly outdated. It goes back to the days when $10,000 in life 
insurance was a meaningful figure. Today, $100,000 would be much more 
reasonable, and someone in the Legislature really should propose a change in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, however, about 90% of the life policies written in California 
-- regardless of the face amount -- include the 10-day free-look clause anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only exceptions are some of the high-yielding universal-life 
policies or annuities." 
</P>
<P>
But, even though most policies carry the free-look provision, the consumer 
still has to be wary, Langenbacher warns. "Some agents will wait until 10 days 
after the policy is in effect before they'll deliver it to the policyholder." 
</P>
<P>
What the law stipulates, though, is not 10 days after the effective date of the 
policy but 10 days after the policyholder has received it. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes it imperative that -- if the agent personally delivers the policy 
to you -- you make him sign a dated receipt of its delivery. If it comes by 
mail, by all means save the envelope with the postmark," Langenbacher warns. 
"Then, assuming that it does have the free-look provision, you should have no 
trouble getting your premium returned, as long as you can prove that you acted 
within 10 days of receipt. Send a copy of the agent's receipt, or the 
postmarked envelope, back to the company demanding refund -- and do this by 
certified mail, return receipt requested." 
</P>
<P>
In your case, according to the department of insurance records, it isn't clear 
whether your policy had the free-look provision, because you didn't move fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Langenbacher adds, "even with the free-look clause, if you 
don't act quickly, you've bought yourself a policy on the 11th day." 
</P>
<P>
Don't sign anything . . . don't pay anything . . . until you know, for sure, 
what you're buying.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: GOOD MARKS FOR GOLD SHEAFFER PENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My mother has a fountain pen made by the Sheaffer Pen Co. in the 
early 1920s. The tip is 14-karat gold. A friend of hers told her these pens are 
worth quite a bit of money. She would like to know if there is someone who 
could tell her something about it. -- M.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Cliff Lawrence, who founded the Pen Fancier's Club in 1976, said if the 
Sheaffer is in fine condition, it could bring more than $300 in the collectible 
marketplace -- but added that it should still be a practical writing pen to 
enhance its value. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 5,000 pen collectors in this country, many of them belong to 
the Pen Fancier's Club, 1169 Overcash Drive, Dunedin, Fla. 34698; telephone 
(813) 734-4742. Lawrence said about 2,500 subscribers worldwide take the club's 
monthly magazine for an annual fee of $30. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, 56, a former lab technician-turned writing-instrument dealer, said he 
also publishes a mail-order list, which generates sales of up to 200 pens a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who collect in this country are professional people," he said in a 
recent telephone interview. "Dentists are big collectors." So are residents of 
Italy, Japan and France, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Just writing a letter was an adventure until the 1880s, Lawrence said, when 
Lewis Edson Waterman developed the first fountain pen that could carry its own 
supply of ink and write without gushing all over the paper or, indeed, running 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
"He started everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, along came W. A. Sheaffer, a jeweler by trade, forming a fountain 
pen company in Springfield, Mass., along with a factory in Fort Madison, Iowa, 
where he lived. He prospered after he patented a pen filled by use of a lever 
in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
By 1912, Sheaffer was successfully mass producing pens. By this time he had 
modified a process marketed by another firm, the Conklin Pen Co., which allowed 
him to be the first to succeed with a pen that pumped ink up through the nib 
from a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Then, during the 1920s, Sheaffer "introduced the lifetime pen with a white dot 
on the top of the cap," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheaffer took a lot of pride in the points. The number (on the point) gave the 
pen an individuality to keep track of when the pen was made." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Lawrence said, "any old Sheaffer pen is collectible. A good 
Sheaffer in a large size can be worth $350." 
</P>
<P>
As for his passion for fountain pens, Lawrence said he became interested in 
pens during World War II when he was growing up in Lansdowne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Pens and watches, he recalled, were about the only things of value being 
marketed during the war. The reason, he said, was the general lack of 
restrictions on products using gold and silver content, in contrast to a dearth 
of brass, aluminum, tin and other strategic metals being utilized for the war. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine a 13-year-old kid going to the drugstore for soda and there 
were velvet-lined boxes with some of the most beautiful pens and pencils you 
ever saw," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence had about 30 pens, he said, but during a tour in the Navy during the 
Korean War, his collection was lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, in the early 1970s, my mother found one of my pens, a Sheaffer lifetime 
pen," he said. "At the time, I was collecting radios. I dropped the radios and 
went back searching for pens." 
</P>
<P>
Although collecting fountain pens was "an addiction like any other collecting," 
Lawrence said he no longer collects them, but rather concentrates on the sales 
of collectible pens. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten pens no one could have found," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He vividly remembered, for example, selling for $4,500 in 1986 a Parker snake 
pen. It was so called because a French jeweler had wrapped the barrel with a 
solid sterling silver snake with emerald eyes along with a similar snake around 
the cap.

YOUR COINS: MEXICAN MONEY: WHAT'S THE GRADE NORTH OF THE BORDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Today, there is an active market for United States uncirculated coins 
graded MS-63, MS-64 and MS-65. I would like to know if there is such a market 
for Mexican coins as well. If not, do you see one developing in the future? -- 
R.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Mexican coins have long been popular with U.S. collectors. In part this 
is due to the proximity of Mexico. In part it has to do with the normal 
collecting urge. There are collectors for every country imaginable, but Mexico 
and Canada rank high with Americans because of common interests, shared 
histories and virtually open borders. 
</P>
<P>
During Spanish rule, Mexican coinage circulated freely in the United States, 
and many consider pieces of eight (some minted in Mexico) among our earliest 
coins. There is an active market for such coins and others during the colonial 
period of Mexico. Modern issues also have a strong following. 
</P>
<P>
Just as you'll find dealers who specialize in ancient coinage or world coins, 
so too you will find some who are experts in Mexico or South America. But there 
are differences insofar as grading is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
United States coins are now virtually universally graded on a scale of 1 to 70 
with coins in the 60-to-70 range considered to be uncirculated. The higher the 
grade the better and more expensive the coin. Some grading services and dealers 
will vouch for the quality of a coin. But even so, there is often disagreement 
between grading services and dealers as to the accuracy of a given grade. And 
beyond this, two similar coins given the same grade may still vary in price due 
to the greater eye appeal. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no such grading services exist for foreign coins, although some dealers 
will personally grade them and some grading services have flirted with the idea 
of grading them. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion regarding Mexican coins would be to purchase the best quality 
available, keeping in mind that no universal grading standards actually exist. 
Experience is still the best teacher. Grading is an art, not a science. 
</P>
<P>
Q: About 20 years ago while selling Girl Scout cookies a customer mentioned 
saving bills with Joseph Barr's signature. He said they would be valuable 
because of the short term he held office under President Kennedy. I've never 
seen or heard anything about this. What determines the value? -- K.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Many people are under the impression that bills with Barr's signature are 
valuable. This is a fallacy. It's true that he was Treasurer for a short period 
of time, but the government made sure that millions and millions of bills 
bearing his signature were run off in order to prevent hoarding and 
speculation. Whatever bills you might have are just worth face value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: One of my hobbies is collecting coins. One of the oldest I have is marked 
1893, 1 florin, 2 shillings. The opposite face is marked Victoria . dei . gra . 
Britt . Regina . Fid. Def. Ind. Imp. How much is this coin worth now? -- M.F.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your coin is British and worth about $3. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My mother noticed your column and remembers she had brought home a few half 
dollars. (I had already had some.) I read your article about the value of 1964, 
'65, '68 and '69 half dollars. I don't have any of those, but I do have 1970s 
and '80s. The most interesting is a 1776-1976 Bicentennial. How much is it 
worth? Also, I have 1956, '52 and '39 pennies. How much are they worth? -- L.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your half dollars, I'm sorry to say, are just worth face value. The 
Bicentennial is a nice coin, but millions and millions were made for 
circulation. Some proof and uncirculated silver pieces do have collector value. 
Your wheat-back cents too are probably just worth face value. You can learn 
more about coins and values by talking to coin dealers, joining a coin club and 
reading books on the subject. Some good primers are "High Profits From Rare 
Coin Investment" by Q. David Bowers and "The Coin Collector's Survival Manual" 
by Scott A. Travers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a decade, drug enforcement officials had stalked the man they 
called "the godfather" of Mexican cocaine trafficking, but Miguel Angel Felix 
Gallardo routinely eluded them through a network of secret ranches and urban 
safehouses, hidden telephone lines and police protection. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, what were intended as surprise raids on three of the reputed 
drug lord's houses in Guadalajara came an hour too late and ended in another 
failure for U.S. and Mexican officials. Instead of hauling in Felix Gallardo, 
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had to pull its own agents out of 
Guadalajara for several days to ensure their safety. 
</P>
<P>
In their absence, or perhaps because of it, Felix Gallardo grew complacent. He 
remained in one house for three days, unaware that Mexican police officers 
posing as newlyweds had rented an apartment across the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw Their Chance 
</P>
<P>
"Each morning, his bodyguards went out for breakfast," a drug official 
recounted. "The pattern repeated itself for two days, so we said, 'If it's the 
same tomorrow, that's our chance.' That's exactly what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The capture of Felix Gallardo last Saturday seems an unquestionable success. 
U.S. and Mexican officials charge that he ran a multibillion-dollar drug ring 
employing about 3,000 people, including police and politicians. He owned 
hotels, a small fleet of aircraft and 250 houses and ranches in several states. 
</P>
<P>
But his dramatic arrest highlights a new and more disturbing dynamic in the 
decades-long fight against illegal cocaine smuggling into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming repeated assaults on their production and determined efforts to 
block their traditional transportation routes, the drug kingpins of South 
America have blazed new trails through Mexico, Central America and their own 
continent that make the international drug war in some ways more daunting than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico's case, a massive U.S. interdiction program throughout the Caribbean 
in recent years has increasingly shifted traffickers away from their usual 
routes to south Florida and made this country a growing transshipment point for 
South American cocaine headed for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although no coca is grown in Mexico -- an inhospitable climate for the highland 
plant whose dried leaves are the source of cocaine -- Mexican officials now 
estimate that 15% of the refined cocaine consumed in the United States passes 
through here. U.S. officials put the estimate far higher, saying that as much a 
third of the U.S.-bound cocaine may now come through America's southern 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of which figure is accurate now, a scant four years ago the total 
was only 1% or 2%. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffickers have an infinity of routes," said Hernan Vargas, a narcotics 
officer with Costa Rica's judicial police force. "They are gamblers. They 
spread their bets all over the board. For every route we cut off, they get 
through on 10 others." 
</P>
<P>
So many are those options, in fact, that enforcement officials fear a crackdown 
in Mexico could simply push the traffickers deeper into Central America or, as 
it has in the past, draw Colombians north in their place. 
</P>
<P>
The last major assault on Mexican drug organizations came in 1985, after the 
kidnaping and torture-death of Guadalajara-based DEA agent Enrique S. Camarena 
and his Mexican pilot. Drug lords Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca 
Carrillo were jailed and Felix Gallardo, suspected of ordering the killing, 
went into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer Off Limits 
</P>
<P>
The arrests opened the way for Colombian traffickers to move into territory 
previously off limits to them. Until then, the Mexican drug organizations had 
jealously controlled the Mexico leg of the cocaine journey, insisting on 
picking up the narcotics in South America and delivering them to Americans at 
the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Colombian traffickers, who dominate the world cocaine market, have 
begun cutting out Mexican middlemen and hauling the refined white powder 
themselves, in Colombian planes with Colombian pilots. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the traffickers make pit stops in Central America. They refuel 
or change airplanes at isolated airstrips in the coastal lowlands of Belize, 
western Costa Rica, southern Guatemala and northern Honduras. Then they take 
off again for Mexico, where they aim to land as close as possible to the U.S. 
border. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombians came in like jackals over a dead zebra. And there was no lion 
there to shoo them away," one U.S. drug enforcement official recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Tons Shipped Each Month 
</P>
<P>
Although Felix Gallardo denies all charges against him, officials say he 
trafficked for Pablo Escobar, a kingpin of Colombia's Medellin cartel and one 
of the world's richest cocaine traders. They say Felix Gallardo shipped an 
estimated four tons of cocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border each month, 
controlling supplies to the West Coast. Even traffickers who did not work for 
him reportedly had to seek his permission to operate along the border with 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"He controlled everything, and other people can't easily jump into that 
position," said a drug enforcement official who, like many of those 
interviewed, declined to be identified for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"What about protection? Who's going to go in and say it's business as usual? 
You've got to have the boss. It's the Latin American way of doing things. 
People like to talk to the boss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Gallardo held on to shipping to the West Coast of the United States -- 
including the lucrative Southern California market -- but the Colombians have 
taken over shipping to the Midwest and East Coast and now control two-thirds of 
the cocaine traffic through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
At least 158 Colombians have been arrested in Mexico on drug charges over the 
last six years, Mexican officials say. They admit concern about the Colombian 
infiltration into their country, noting the extent to which drug cartels have 
subverted national institutions in Colombia -- in particular, the justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombians are more bloodthirsty delinquents," one Mexican official said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hesitate to speculate on the long-term effect of the Felix Gallardo 
arrest on cocaine supplies in the United States, but Ed Heath, DEA chief for 
Mexico, told reporters that it would have "a significant impact" on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, drug officials wonder how long that will last. "The demand 
is still there," according to one source, who added that "there is a serious 
user problem in the United States" -- still the biggest, most lucrative cocaine 
market in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine seizures in Mexico have increased steadily, from about five metric tons 
in 1986 to 15 metric tons last year. U.S. and Mexican officials consider the 
increase to be a barometer indicating how much more cocaine is getting through. 
</P>
<P>
"We seized 2.7 (metric) tons of cocaine in three months, but I am sure a lot 
more than that passed by," said Javier Coello Trejo, Mexico's deputy attorney 
general in charge of narcotics investigations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Cache Was Almost 5 Tons 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that we'd seize 300 kilos tops and think it was a lot," he 
added. "Last year we found a cache of almost five tons. That says there is more 
production (in South America) and more consumption in the United States." A 
kilo is 2.2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of traffic can be seen in U.S. seizures as well. In 1988, U.S. 
authorities confiscated 37.6 metric tons of cocaine, officials in Washington 
said. Of that, 28.4 tons were seized in Florida and 8.1 tons were intercepted 
near the Mexican border, with the rest being stopped elsewhere in the South. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the seizures along the Mexican border were sizable: 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 9, 1988. Agents found 895 kilos on an 18-wheeler tractor-trailer 
crossing the border at McAllen, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aug. 29, 1988. Another 1,232 kilos were found on a tractor-trailer at 
McAllen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 15, 1988. Authorities found 857 kilos on vehicles crossing at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Mexico's new prominence as a "trampoline" to the United States is due 
to the U.S. interception program in the Caribbean. According to U.S. officials, 
cocaine shipments moved relatively freely through south Florida until the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it moved by private plane direct from Colombia, or with a refueling 
stop in the Bahamas," said John McGee, assistant special agent in charge of 
U.S. Customs in Miami. "They used to land right in our municipal airports." 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials responded in 1981 and 1982 with two executive jets fitted 
with sophisticated radar and a radar blimp called "Fat Albert" near Key West. 
Officials later launched a second blimp at Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure in Florida airspace, the traffickers changed routes between 1983 
and 1984, flying to airstrips in the Bahamas, where they moved their cargo to 
high-speed boats. They particularly liked Bimini, 49 miles off Florida, and 
Norman's Cay, where Medellin drug lord Carlos Lehder reportedly had established 
a refueling station for traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The break in the Caribbean came in 1986, after authorities had further 
tightened their radar net. When charges of corruption reached as high as Prime 
Minister Lynden Pindling, the Bahamian government bowed to U.S. pressure and 
agreed to an extraordinary surrender of sovereignty that permits U.S. Customs, 
DEA and Coast Guard aircraft and vessels to use the islands as a base to pursue 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the United States has launched a third blimp on Grand Bahama Island 
and plans to put a fourth in operation this fall at Georgetown, Great Exuma. 
Two more, one in Puerto Rico and another on Great Inagua Island, will complete 
the radar fence. 
</P>
<P>
The surveillance net forced traffickers to adopt another series of changes. 
Some planes moved to more remote islands, where the cocaine was transferred to 
long-range cabin cruisers. Haiti, with its extremely impoverished population 
and ineffective police force, has become a preferred landing spot. A few planes 
fly around the western tip of Cuba and land on the Florida Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airdropping Loads of Drugs 
</P>
<P>
In addition, traffickers have revived a marijuana smugglers' trick of 
airdropping loads of drugs to mother ships at sea, DEA special agent Jack Hook 
said in Miami. He said the traffickers fly across central Cuba, drop the 
cocaine to a ship at a rendezvous point and fly nonstop back to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the drug flights have official Cuban approval, but Hook 
contended that Cuban officials must know about them because so many planes fly 
across the waist of their country. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, smugglers also switched to cargo ships. "The trend is to 
larger shipments in cargo containers," Hook said. "They're doing a very good 
job of disguising it." 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine stashes have been found in shipments of hollowed-out pineapples, cut 
flowers, frozen fish and other perishables, which are prime vehicles because 
they must be cleared quickly through customs to avoid spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sesame Seeds, Auto Parts 
</P>
<P>
"We've found dope in sesame seeds, auto parts, airplane engines, brown sugar, 
candy, cans of barbecued green beans, frozen fruit juice -- you name it," McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most clever ruses, Hook recalled, was pure, liquefied cocaine 
contained in clear plastic bags tucked inside water-filled plastic sacks of 
live tropical fish. From the outside, all that could be seen was fish and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the bags in a big shipment leaked and killed all the fish, or we 
wouldn't have discovered it," he said. "Who knows how much moved that way 
before we caught it?" 
</P>
<P>
To date, the biggest cocaine hauls from cargo boats were two shipments hidden 
among pallets of Brazilian cedar boards. Dozens of the 12-foot-by-4-inch planks 
had been hollowed out, stuffed with cocaine and then meticulously sealed so 
they looked as solid as the other boards. One batch, seized by the DEA at Port 
Everglades, Fla., on Nov. 17, 1987, yielded 8,968 pounds of cocaine; the 
second, seized by customs in Tampa, Fla., last May, contained 7,211 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But even as they used greater ingenuity in the Caribbean, the smugglers shifted 
much of their traffic westward. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials believe Guatemala is now the favored transshipment point in 
Central America, followed by Honduras and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's uses are limited by civil war and a lack of extensive lowlands. 
Officials have little information on Nicaragua but believe the war has limited 
its role, too. Tiny Belize, meanwhile, has begun handling more and more cocaine 
traffic as its marijuana fortunes have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The largest cocaine seizure in Central America to date occurred in Puerto 
Barrios, Guatemala, in 1987. Three Turbo Commander 1000 airplanes from Colombia 
made drops of 800 kilos each on a jungle strip several miles inland. From 
there, the 2,400-kilo shipment was taken to port on a banana train and loaded 
onto a Miami-bound container ship with Panamanian registry. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a one-shot, fluke thing," one DEA official said. "We're lucky if 
we seize 1% of the cocaine going through Guatemala." 
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan officials seized 850 kilos in all of 1988 and one 349-kilo shipment 
so far this year. Former Interior Minister Juan Jose Rodil said his country 
offers "ideal conditions" as a staging area for traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an absolute lack of internal controls. Drug planes come and go at 
will. Half of the 50,000 trucks crossing our borders each year are not 
inspected. The customs agency is corrupt from top to bottom," Rodil said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Level Corruption 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, high-level corruption is a problem throughout Central America. Last 
year two U.S. grand juries indicted Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega on 
charges of narcotics trafficking, and U.S. officials have long charged that his 
country is a center for laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Last year U.S. officials accused the Honduran military chief, Gen. Humberto 
Regalado Hernandez, of allowing Colombian traffickers to transship through 
Honduras for pay. Also last year, however, Honduran authorities arrested Juan 
Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a major drug figure working for the Medellin cartel, 
and turned him over to U.S. marshals, who brought him back to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala, some authorities suspect former Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera 
Hidalgo of ties to trafficking. In a case that broke last July, officials 
seized Erico Alfonso Ralda Batres as he claimed 54 pounds of cocaine in 
suitcases at Aurora International Airport. Waiting for Ralda in a jeep outside 
the terminal building was Carlos Cabrera, brother of the former foreign 
minister. The incident led to a flurry of newspaper speculation that Cabrera 
Hidalgo, now a Christian Democratic Party candidate for president, was involved 
in trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Although traffickers like to stop over in Central America, they can fly 
directly from South America to Mexico with extra fuel -- but the trade-off is 
that the more fuel they carry, the less room they have for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Many planes that once flew to the Bahamas now land on Mexico's Yucatan 
Peninsula and unload onto trucks. More commonly, Mexican officials say, the 
planes fly nonstop from Colombia up the Pacific and Gulf coasts of Mexico, then 
cut inland to isolated landing strips in the states of Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, 
Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid detection, the drug planes usually stay low and about 10 miles 
offshore. Some escape notice through a daring technique called "mating," where 
two aircraft fly in formation -- as close together as possible -- to show only 
a single blip on radar screens. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the planes reach their destination, they peel apart. One follows a 
legitimate flight plan and lands legally, while the other dumps the cocaine 
elsewhere and takes off again. 
</P>
<P>
The smugglers favor Turbo Commander 1000s or Cessna 206s, which can fly nonstop 
from Colombia with an extra fuel tank and can land with little damage to the 
aircraft on the innumerable short, dirt airstrips that dot the Mexican 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Tactics and technology are only partly responsible for the traffickers' 
success, however. The main ingredient, U.S. officials say, is corruption: 
Large-scale cocaine shippers, Mexican or Colombian, could not operate in Mexico 
without some kind of official protection to get their planes in and out of 
Mexico or their trucks across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials have always bristled at such charges. But Mexican Atty. Gen. 
Enrique Alvarez del Castillo made his government's first public acknowledgement 
of official complicity in drug trafficking this week, when he announced that 
six law enforcement authorities were arrested for having supplied Felix 
Gallardo with weapons, radio equipment and information on drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The high-level arrests were unusual -- and they included one of the attorney 
general's own deputies, Gregorio Enrique Corza Marin, who not only headed drug 
investigations for Sinaloa state but also was a relative of the wife of Coello 
Trejo, the deputy attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were the city police commander in Culiacan, the capital of 
Sinaloa, the Sinaloa state Judicial Police commander and three Federal Highway 
Police commanders. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrests, officials reported droves of desertions from the police 
forces of Guadalajara, Culiacan and Mazatlan -- cities where Felix Gallardo 
maintained operations bases. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say the arrests send a signal to other traffickers and police 
officials that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari "means business." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has called the war on drugs a national priority and raised the budget 
for drug enforcement by 174% over last year, to $53 million. His administration 
also is installing a $50-million radar system in the Gulf of Tehuantepec with 
the capacity to detect low-flying aircraft 30 miles out to sea. The Mexican air 
force will be employed to chase down the craft. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Felix Gallardo, authorities have arrested two mid-level 
traffickers this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Ontiveros Lucero, one of the most notorious smugglers along the 
U.S.-Mexico border, was jailed in Chihuahua state after officials seized eight 
tons of marijuana believed to be his. Soon after, police jailed Giuseppe Catani 
Ponsiglione, a one-time heroin smuggler convicted in the United States years 
ago as part of the "French Connection" heroin-smuggling operation. Police 
seized 650 kilos of cocaine from an airplane that arrived in Chihuahua from 
Bogota and believed Catani was behind the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these advances, U.S. officials remain cautiously guarded. They recall a 
history of other cases that have not gone as well, such as the Mexican army's 
discovery of 4.8 metric tons of cocaine in a cave in Chihuahua state last year 
-- the largest cocaine seizure in Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe the haul was really 8 tons on 17 flights from Colombia 
and that the army let 3 tons go through. No one was arrested, no plane was 
seized and, at the time, the government played down a bust it should have been 
proud to flaunt, they say. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources suspect the former Mexico defense minister, Gen. Juan Arevalo 
Gardoqui, of complicity in this and other drug deals. Arevalo, who reportedly 
is living in a costly home in Chihuahua state, is one of several officials that 
the Salinas administration has quietly retired. 
</P>
<P>
"This government has the right approach. But there is the right approach, and 
there is reality. There are people who are just not going to be publicly 
exposed, but who will be dismissed for health or whatever reasons," one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials initially were stunned by Salinas' appointment as attorney 
general of Alvarez del Castillo, a former governor of Jalisco state who 
apparently ignored flourishing drug trafficking there. But his deputy, Coello 
Trejo, is well regarded among both U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials, 
who gave him the title "iron prosecutor" when he last served in the attorney 
general's office, from 1971 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old lawyer is seen as a man with a mandate from President Salinas, 
and Coello Trejo vows to use his power to make more arrests. With the removal 
of Felix Gallardo, he said, "there's going to be a fight to see who takes his 
place, and we're going to be there watching."

UEBERROTH ENDS EFFORT TO BUY EASTERN AIRLINES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter V. Ueberroth formally abandoned his bid to acquire Eastern Airlines on 
Wednesday after he and Eastern's owners pronounced themselves hopelessly 
deadlocked over who should manage the company while the strikebound carrier is 
in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were signs that a federal bankruptcy judge still hoped to 
salvage the deal, the failure apparently marked the end of an alliance between 
the former baseball commissioner and the unions that have virtually grounded 
Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth had proposed last week to buy Eastern for $464 million in a 
partnership with the unions. But the bitter dispute between organized labor and 
Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent firm, Texas Air Corp., ultimately 
derailed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Sides Voice Chagrin 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, both sides voiced chagrin that the sale had fallen 
through. Lorenzo did not participate in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're deeply disappointed," Ueberroth said. The president of Eastern, Phil 
Bakes, described the proposed sale as "a unique and once-in-a-moment 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Bakes vowed to reorganize Eastern as a smaller airline, which the company had 
been trying to do anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a federal judge in Miami upheld the right of 
Eastern's pilots to honor picket lines of the striking machinists' union. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis seriously hurt the company's 
effort to get the airline flying again. The company said it would ask a federal 
appeals court to overturn the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing strike worsens Eastern's financial situation each day, and, in New 
York, federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland acted late Wednesday to 
increase the pressure on the airline's owners. He has repeatedly voiced his 
determination to get Eastern back in the air. 
</P>
<P>
In responding to a petition filed by an unhappy Eastern customer, the judge 
ordered Eastern to show at a hearing Monday why it should not be auctioned off 
but barred from consummating the sale of its profitable Northeastern shuttle 
service to real estate tycoon Donald Trump for $365 million. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Ueberroth also were ordered to be at the Monday hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The order indicated that the judge might unravel several major transactions 
among Eastern, Texas Air and Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air. 
These include the controversial sale in 1987 of Eastern's reservations system 
to Continental for a reputed bargain price of $100 million. Eastern might also 
regain planes it sold to Continental and return cash it received for those 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Suitors in Wings 
</P>
<P>
Several other potential suitors for the airline remain in the wings, including 
TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn, who issued a statement Wednesday saying that he 
remained interested in Eastern. In the past, Texas Air has also received an 
offer from Jay Pritzker, head of the Hyatt Hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
A Manhattan diamond dealer Willy Censor, 62, said Wednesday he has formed a 
partnership with an unidentified foreign airline that he said could raise more 
than $250 million by the end of the week to buy Eastern. Eastern attorney David 
Boies said he had met with Censor but it was unclear whether the offer was 
considered legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth purchase plan fell apart over a demand by him and the airline's 
machinists', pilots' and flight attendants' unions that Judge Lifland name a 
trustee to run Eastern, which would have wrested control of the carrier from 
Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely will not return to work for Lorenzo," machinists' union Vice 
President John Peterpaul declared. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern strenuously opposed the appointment of a trustee. Bakes said at the 
press conference that it would have created "all kinds of uncertainties for the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ueberroth said his deal was "over" and "done," a partner, J. Thomas 
Talbot of Newport Beach, Calif., said: "Nobody can predict the future." 
</P>
<P>
"The deal isn't dead if Lorenzo comes back to him," said another source close 
to Ueberroth. "But he isn't making any initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
Bakes said that, since the strike began, Texas Air has had three options. It 
could sell Eastern, liquidate the carrier -- which he characterized as the most 
profitable of the three choices -- or rebuild a smaller Eastern, "which would 
require the sale of some assets." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the vastly scaled-back new Eastern would serve only 60 to 80 
cities and would reduce its fleet from its current level of about 250 planes to 
between 130 and 150 planes. And he said the company would reduce its work force 
to between 50% and 60% of its prestrike level, which was 31,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since the strike began, Eastern has been able to operate only about 10% of its 
normally scheduled 1,040 flights, and many of those have taken off with very 
few passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Will Never Go Back' 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of Eastern's unionized machinists are still on strike. And there 
is no indication that the company's pilots and flight attendants, who have 
overwhelmingly supported the strike, will back off. Jack Bavis, head of 
Eastern's pilots' union, has vowed on numerous occasions in recent days that 
"we will never go back to work for Lorenzo." 
</P>
<P>
The federal court decision in Miami amounted to a major victory for the pilots, 
their union said. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal court . . . has shut the door on management's last hope of forcing 
Eastern pilots back to work," the pilots' union statement said Wednesday night.

BUSH PROPOSAL WOULD CURB SPECIAL PROSECUTOR POWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is proposing to use its new ethics reform legislation 
as a vehicle to reduce substantially the independence of the special 
prosecutors appointed to investigate government wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, some of which have been sought for years by executive branch 
officials, are designed to give the Justice Department more control over the 
prosecutors, known formally as independent counsels. Several members of the 
Ronald Reagan Administration were investigated by independent counsels. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush is proposing that special prosecutors, not the Justice 
Department, investigate allegations of wrongdoing by members of Congress in the 
same way that they investigate top executive branch officials. That decision 
came despite serious reservations by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who has argued 
that his department's Public Integrity Section is fully able to handle 
investigations of members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes could be highly controversial in Congress. In the past, 
Congress has rejected repeated attempts by the executive branch to obtain more 
control over the prosecutors, contending that independence is essential to 
avoid conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes, the Administration proposal would remove an independent 
counsel's power to hire his own staff and would give the attorney general 
substantial control over who could be appointed as an independent counsel. The 
counsels are selected by a special judicial panel after the Justice Department 
determines that an inquiry is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
The special prosecutor law was passed after the Watergate scandal of the 1970s 
because of concerns that the attorney general, appointed by the President, 
could not always be counted on to investigate fully allegations against other 
senior presidential appointees. 
</P>
<P>
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, in an analysis of the proposed legislation 
that his office prepared, argued that "there is a comparable argument that 
could be made that Department of Justice investigations of powerful individuals 
in the legislature can be extremely awkward." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, by contrast, in a statement issued Wednesday, noted that the 
"established system for handling allegations of wrongdoing by members of 
Congress . . . has worked well for many years" and that 20 members of Congress, 
including some powerful committee chairmen, have been convicted of criminal 
offenses since the Public Integrity Section was established in 1976, when 
Thornburgh headed the department's criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan Administration, independent counsels twice were appointed to 
investigate Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III, former White House aides Lynn Nofziger 
and Michael K. Deaver, national security advisers Robert C. McFarlane and John 
M. Poindexter and NSC aide Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
Meese, after the second investigation of his affairs, issued a regulation 
shortly before he resigned extending the special prosecutor law to Congress. 
Thornburgh revoked that rule Wednesday, saying that the issue should be left to 
Congress to decide, now that Bush had made a legislative proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals to reduce the independence of the special prosecutors appear near 
the end of Bush's 100-page ethics package. Among other changes, an independent 
counsel would be barred from publicly releasing a report on an inquiry unless 
the subject of his investigation is indicted. Meese reacted angrily last year 
after independent counsel James C. McKay, while deciding against indicting the 
then-attorney general, criticized him sharply in his report. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes also would give the attorney general substantial power 
over the scope of an independent counsel's investigation. Currently, that power 
is held by the special judicial panel that appoints the prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration made several attempts to restrict the authority of 
independent counsels, going as far as the Supreme Court in an attempt to have 
the law establishing special prosecutors declared unconstitutional. And in the 
Jimmy Carter Administration, then-Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell argued against the 
prosecutors.

MIT SEEKS PATENT ON DISPUTED PROCESS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIETS CLAIM SUCCESS IN DUPLICATING FUSION TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The effort to produce nuclear fusion in a test tube went global Wednesday when 
Soviet physicists announced that they had succeeded in duplicating a 
controversial Utah experiment while the two scientists who started it all 
defended their work on two continents. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a top scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
announced that he had developed a theory explaining how the "cold fusion" 
process works. Although other MIT scientists said a few days ago that they had 
given up after failing to duplicate the experiment, the institute announced 
that it had "filed patent applications in connection with the theoretical 
analysis" developed by Peter Hagelstein, 34, an associate professor of 
electrical engineering and computer science. 
</P>
<P>
Hagelstein, who was not available for comment, was considered one of the 
brightest scientists working on the Strategic Defense Initiative when he left 
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory for MIT a year ago. His explanation for how cold 
fusion might work inspired his institute to apply for a patent for a process 
that other MIT scientists had concluded was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin 
Fleischmann of the University of Southampton took center stage Wednesday to 
defend their work -- Pons in Dallas and Fleischmann in Erice, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, about 7,000 chemists attending a meeting of the American Chemical 
Society nearly filled the Dallas Convention Center's arena for an address by 
Pons, who stunned the scientific world three weeks ago when he and Fleischmann 
announced that they had achieved nuclear fusion in a test tube at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's presentation generated little heat, and less light, because 
Pons offered virtually no new details about experiments that are still regarded 
with great skepticism by physicists. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas meeting was relatively low-key, but at a meeting in Sicily, 
Fleischmann had to fend off questions from a flood of scientists who have been 
unable to repeat his experiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pie in the Sky' 
</P>
<P>
"Making energy out of water is really pie in the sky at this point," challenged 
Matthijs Broer, a nuclear physicist from AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratory in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't seen what you've seen," Broer told Fleischmann. "We don't see 
the neutrons, or gamma rays. What's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
Broer's comments reflect the frustration of scores of scientists who have tried 
to repeat the experiment but have not detected neutrons or gamma rays, whose 
presence would indicate that nuclear fusion is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
At least one scientist attending a meeting at the "Ettore Majorana" Center for 
Scientific Culture in western Sicily suggested that may be for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Koonin, a theoretical physicist from Caltech -- a man not noted for 
making brash statements -- told Fleischmann that the Utah experiments may have 
a dark side, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can do nuclear fusion in your kitchen then . . . you can undoubtedly 
make a weapon out of it and then we're in big trouble," Koonin said. 
Fleischmann has denied that the process could be used to make weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann have warned repeatedly that researchers should use extreme 
caution. At one point in their work, which stretched over five years, their 
experiment got so hot that a palladium electrode "vaporized," the scientists 
said at their Salt Lake City press conference March 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Sicily meeting gave Fleischmann an opportunity to mend a few bridges with 
another Utah scientist who has also claimed to have achieved fusion in a test 
tube, but who has disputed the Pons and Fleischmann claim of producing excess 
energy. Steven Jones, a physicist at Brigham Young University, had complained 
earlier that the other scientists broke an agreement to publish their work 
simultaneously with his. 
</P>
<P>
"We want now to work together if this proves practicable," Fleischmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the hottest news of the day came from Moscow, where scientists said 
they had repeated the Utah experiment successfully about 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out in late March that such experiments had already been 
conducted at Utah University, I decided to repeat them here," physicist Runar 
Kuzmin of Moscow University told the Soviet news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the researchers observed the gradual heating of the 
deuterium-enriched water -- in which the experiment was placed -- to the 
boiling point. The Soviets also claim to have seen neutrons. 
</P>
<P>
"The experiments were surprisingly simple," Kuzmin said. That claim may come as 
a shock to dozens of major laboratories that have been unable to repeat the 
experiments despite considerable efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow University has now joined Texas A&amp;M and the Georgia Institute of 
Technology, both of which claimed Monday to have verified two critical parts of 
the Utah experiment. The Texas team said it produced heat with an apparatus 
like the one used in Utah, and Georgia Tech said it detected a low level of 
neutrons from a similar experiment. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours Wednesday, Pons answered questions about his experiments -- 
first from other chemists who were eager for more details, and then from nearly 
150 members of the press corps, most of whom had flown to Dallas for the 
symposium. Both sessions were more dispassionate than had been expected, and 
scientists and journalists left with many of their most crucial questions 
avoided or unanswered -- and their minds unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Chemist Allen J. Bard of the University of Texas at Austin, who also spoke at 
the session, said that Pons' work was "clearly a very interesting experiment . 
. . but the verdict is still out." 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker was more positive, however. Chemist Ernest Yeager of Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland noted that "it is all beginning to add 
up to a very interesting case." 
</P>
<P>
Fusion is a nuclear process in which two atoms -- typically either deuterium or 
tritium, both heavy forms of hydrogen -- are fused together, releasing energy 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Pons' and Fleischmann's results have been highly controversial because their 
approach was completely unexpected. Whereas most fusion researchers have used 
extremely high temperatures and powerful magnetic fields in multimillion-dollar 
devices to fuse the atoms, Pons and Fleischmann used simple palladium and 
platinum electrodes placed in a small jar of deuterium oxide, so-called heavy 
water, and connected to a battery. 
</P>
<P>
They reported that this simple device, which could be built in a freshman 
chemistry lab, yielded much more energy than they put into it and that they 
detected neutrons and tritium, the radioactive products of a fusion reaction. 
Physicists objected to their conclusions, however, noting that the amount of 
fusion necessary to produce the heat they observed would have yielded at least 
a billion times more tritium and neutrons than they detected. 
</P>
<P>
The recent claims of confirmation from Texas, Georgia and Moscow are making 
other researchers more confident that Pons and Fleischmann have observed a real 
effect, "but we can't think of what the mechanism can be," Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the difficulties other researchers have had in duplicating his 
results, Pons noted that "I have said all along that it would take a couple of 
weeks after people got the details of our experiments. It's just about two 
weeks now." 
</P>
<P>
Several questioners pressed Pons on the need to conduct a "control" reaction in 
which regular water is used for the process instead of heavy water. 
</P>
<P>
"If that (control) reaction produces energy, we'll know there is a chemical 
process going on and not fusion," said physicist Harold P. Furth, director of 
the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory. If no energy is produced in 
the regular water, he said, then he would be more convinced that fusion is 
occurring because only the heavy water contains deuterium. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the only thing that will galvanize the great nuclear physicists of the 
nation to begin working" on the theoretical questions posed by the discovery, 
Furth said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best expression of the general view of the audience was voiced by 
one questioner who asked Pons: "Are you Prometheus, Pandora or Piltdown man?" 
(Prometheus gave humanity fire, Pandora gave humanity evils, and Piltdown man 
was an anthropological hoax.) 
</P>
<P>
Pons' reply: "No comment."

PAUL GANN ENTERS FRAY ON GAS TAX, BUDGET LIMIT 
</P>

<P>
Anti-tax crusader Paul Gann Wednesday said he will fight the plan unveiled by 
Gov. George Deukmejian to place before the voters a proposal to raise the 
gasoline tax and repeal the government spending limit that Gann conceived in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he is a strong supporter of Deukmejian and a fellow Republican, 
Gann said he will fight the proposal to put on the November ballot a measure to 
raise the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon and revise the expenditure limit to 
allow the increased revenue to be spent. 
</P>
<P>
The limit, Gann told reporters testily, has "worked more than adequately" and 
"should remain to function as the voters intended it to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alive and Kicking' 
</P>
<P>
Appearing healthier than he has since doctors discovered in 1987 that he was 
infected with the AIDS virus, Gann told reporters to "tell people I'm alive and 
kicking" and lashed out at critics who have dared suggest that the spending 
limit has outlived its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't they tell the taxpayer out there, if they are going to remove the 
spending limit completely, where the extra (money) will come from?" Gann asked. 
"You and I both know where they'll get the money. They will pick it out of the 
wallets of the working people of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Gann, besides sponsoring the spending limit initiative, 
co-authored the revolutionary Proposition 13 that in 1978 slashed property 
taxes and radically altered government in California. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Gann, who has tested positive for the AIDS virus but 
has not been formally diagnosed with the disease itself, said his weight, which 
at one point had plummeted to 116 pounds, is back up to 152. He credited his 
good health to his faith in God, weekly Vitamin B-12 shots and a daily dose of 
3,000 milligrams of Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
His doctor, he said, offered a different explanation: "He said, 'If I had to 
say what keeps you alive, it's this fight you are in with the bureaucracy all 
the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for the gasoline tax question, Gann acknowledged that the state must come up 
with money to finance the deficit-plagued state highway system. Last year, in 
fact, he sponsored an initiative that would have shifted all revenues raised by 
the sales tax on gasoline into highway programs, but it was rejected by voters. 
Gann noted that last year's initiative differs from the proposal now in that it 
would have shifted existing taxes, not raised them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasoline Tax 
</P>
<P>
The plan unveiled last week by the governor calls for a measure to be put 
before voters that would raise the gasoline tax 9 cents a gallon, beginning 
with an immediate 5-cent boost, then increasing by 1 cent per year for four 
years. Accompanying the proposal on the ballot would be a measure to raise the 
spending limit in order to allow for revenues raised by the tax to go into 
transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
The spending ceiling, commonly called the Gann Limit because it is so closely 
identified with the anti-tax crusader, restricts the state's annual budget 
growth to a rate tied to inflation and population increases. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who had long defended the limit, altered his position last year 
when voters approved Propositions 98 and 99. Proposition 98, the landmark 
school funding measure, changed the Gann Limit to give public schools and 
community colleges the bulk of future budget surpluses. Proposition 99 placed 
hefty new taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products and provided that the new 
money be free of Gann Limit controls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limit Denounced 
</P>
<P>
Many other state officials have publicly denounced the limit. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's rebuttal, Gann noted that in the last seven years, the state 
budget has just about doubled, going from $24 billion to $47.8 billion, despite 
the limit. "How can it have held anybody back?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in his folksiest manner, he added: "I said, 'Dear Lord, are you saying to 
me that without the spending limit (budget growth) would have been greater than 
that?' The voice came back and said, 'Yeah, it would.' And I said, 'Then, thank 
you, Lord, for the spending limit.' "

COMMITTEE OKS BILL TO BAN MOST ASSAULT GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Assembly Ways and Means Committee cleared the path Wednesday for the 
Legislature to take a big step next week toward declaring California off-limits 
to military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Over Republican opposition, the Democrat-dominated committee approved, 12 to 5, 
and sent to the full Assembly the Senate version of a bill to ban most 
semiautomatic combat firearms of the type that street gangsters and other 
criminals favor. 
</P>
<P>
The full Assembly is expected to consider the bill by Senate leader David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) on Monday morning. Then later in the day, the Senate 
plans to vote on a virtually identical bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian has indicated he would sign a bill outlawing 
semiautomatic combat weapons. For years, the governor had been an opponent of 
gun controls but he announced his opposition to assault rifles two days after 
one was used on Jan. 17 to kill five children on a Stockton school playground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sets Conditions 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has said any bill he signs must be clear and draw a distinction 
between assault guns and standard hunting or sporting firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti told the Ways and Means Committee that he had been in "close contact" 
with assistants to the governor and they "have indicated to me a favorable 
attitude on this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Roos and Roberti earlier had said the technical differences between the two 
bills probably would be reconciled by a Senate-Assembly conference committee, 
which would fashion the final product that goes to Deukmejian. But both 
legislators suggested in recent days that agreement might be reached on one 
bill or the other without having to go to conference. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, a group of gun owners, counseled by former Sen. H. L. Richardson 
(R-Glendora), the leading advocate of the right to own firearms while he was in 
the Legislature, mapped plans to mount an 11th-hour protest Monday against the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said he told the organizer of the proposed "grass-roots" 
demonstration, Thomas F. Metzger, publisher of a small conservative newspaper 
in the Sierra foothill community of Placerville, to lobby in force inside the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside, you band together in groups, go office to office and crowd up the 
halls to let (legislators) know you are there," he said he advised Metzger. 
"They really know you mean something if you show up." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said he had received calls from anxious gun owners throughout Northern 
California asking what could be done to defeat the legislation. He said he 
consulted Richardson and decided upon a lobbying effort in the Capitol rather 
than a rally outside. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said the gun owners intend "to talk to some people who need their tail 
twisted a little bit to get them to vote the proper way." He refused to 
estimate how many people will participate Monday other than to say, "It's going 
to be a lot more than 50." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the effort will concentrate on the Assembly, which last month 
passed Roos' version of the bill without a vote to spare. The Senate is 
considered more receptive to the gun ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intent of Measure 
</P>
<P>
Starting Jan. 1, the legislation would make it a felony to manufacture, import, 
sell or lend about 60 models of rifles, shotguns and pistols that the bill 
lists as assault weapons. Violators could be sent to prison for up to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The bills would establish a registration system for owners of such guns who 
acquired them legally before June 1 of this year. These owners would have until 
1991 to pay an unspecified fee and register them with the state Department of 
Justice. Illegal possession of such a gun would be punishable by up to three 
years in prison. 
</P>

President Bush turned Wednesday to Navy Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, a veteran 
of two space shuttle flights, to take over the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time in its distinguished history that NASA will be led 
by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has been to space," Bush said at 
a White House ceremony at which he announced his plans to nominate Truly to 
succeed James C. Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
Truly has been the agency's associate administrator for space flight since 
1986. He was the pilot of the Columbia on the second shuttle flight, and 
commanded the eighth flight. 
</P>
<P>
He became a central figure in the agency's operations after the Challenger 
disaster on Jan. 28, 1986, leading the NASA recovery team and taking charge of 
the redesign of the shuttle's boosters and safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Design flaws in the boosters were blamed for the Challenger disaster. After 
their redesign and an overhaul of safety operations, the shuttle program 
resumed flights last September. 
</P>
<P>
As an active duty naval officer, Truly must obtain the assent of Congress to 
move into a job designated for a civilian. A White House spokesman said that 
such approval has been obtained. Senate confirmation also is required. 
</P>
<P>
Truly holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from the Georgia 
Institute of Technology and was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy in 
1959.

CONCORDE JET LOSES SECTION OF TAIL, LANDS SAFELY

A supersonic Concorde jet carrying 100 Americans dropped a nine-foot piece of 
its tail over the South Pacific during an attempt to set a speed record, but it 
landed safely and passengers were reported eager to try again. 
</P>
<P>
The tail section of the British Airways plane ripped off Wednesday about 25 
minutes after the plane left Christchurch, New Zealand, for Sydney 1,000 miles 
away. Passengers said the plane shuddered, but the aircraft landed in Sydney 
about an hour later. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is attempting to set speed records for each of 12 legs on a 
three-week trip around the world. The passengers, including commentator William 
F. Buckley Jr., each paid $39,000 for the trip, which began April 1 in London 
and is due to end there April 23. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the rudder disintegrated while the jet was flying at 40,000 feet at 
about 1,500 m.p.h. -- nearly twice the speed of sound, said Peter Stanton, an 
airline spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It experienced a shudder while over the Tasman Sea that was thought to have 
been air turbulence," Stanton said. "But it was a normal landing; there was no 
emergency." 
</P>
<P>
He said the control tower told the pilot, Capt. David Leney, that a piece of 
the tail was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Concordes have been in commercial service since 1976 with no fatal accidents.

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ALASKA OIL SLICK REPORTED

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard reported "significantly less" oil on the water Wednesday after 
high winds and choppy seas dispersed more of the devastating slick from the 
tanker Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
While the forces of nature continued to purge Prince William Sound, man's own 
attempts to clean up the 11-million-gallon mess remained stymied by bureaucracy 
20 days after the tanker ran aground. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the state ferry Aurora, a staging platform for the cleanup effort, state 
Department of Environmental Conservation coordinator Bruce Hoffman was told to 
sit tight by Exxon and the Coast Guard while experts plotted the slick's 
whereabouts and mapped out a plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason workers should be sitting idle while there's so much work to 
be done," Hoffman complained. Hildegarde Knopp, one of 80 workers aboard the 
Aurora, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We wait and we watch movies and then we eat, and then we wait and watch movies 
again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Paul Yost, was due to arrive in Valdez today 
to oversee the cleanup operation at the request of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In flyovers Wednesday, scientists detected no immediate danger of oil hitting 
now-fortified salmon hatcheries or large stretches of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of oil coming out of Prince William Sound and into the Gulf of 
Alaska "has diminished greatly," said Al Hielscher, a National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration data manager. 
</P>
<P>
But fishermen and environmentalists still worry that fickle spring storms could 
sweep oil back toward lucrative salmon hatcheries or onto shores teeming with 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Observers already are calling the fouled coves heavily hit by oil "dead zones" 
because they are so uncustomarily silent and devoid of life.

SCENE OF RITUALISTIC KILLINGS ON BORDER RANCH DESCRIBED

MATAMOROS, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the dirt road that wound through the sorghum fields, the dilapidated shack 
bore no sign of the evil within. 
</P>
<P>
This is where police said the ring of drug smugglers had ritualistically killed 
their victims. Close by was a large iron pot with blood and human brain matter, 
the parts of dead animals, oddities like horseshoes and coins, and a rusted 
machete. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, 12 of the bodies had already been found and the digging would 
begin soon for more. Some of them had been skinned. Others had been 
decapitated. Still others had limbs hacked off and body parts mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Became Victim 
</P>
<P>
One of the bodies found Tuesday, hours after four men had confessed to taking 
part in the mass murders, was that of Mark Kilroy, a University of Texas 
student. He had disappeared March 14 during a rowdy evening in this border city 
while celebrating his school's spring break. 
</P>
<P>
His father, James, told a press conference Wednesday in Brownsville, Tex., just 
across the border, that he was not worried about his son any longer, because 
"our father in heaven loves him even more than we could." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. law enforcement officials said the suspected ringleader of the cult and 
marijuana smuggling operation was a Cuban, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, who was 
believed to have fled into the United States. They said his nickname was "The 
Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the one who directed that these people be picked up and sacrificed," 
said Oran Neck Jr., the resident agent in charge of the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
Three other suspects are being sought, including two men and Sara Villareal 
Adrete, a 24-year-old Matamoros woman whose house was searched Tuesday night. 
Mexican police found a blood spattered sacrificial altar, blood stained 
children's clothing and a variety of voodoo paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
At the remote ranch where the bodies were found, Cameron County Sheriff Alex 
Perez said cult members removed some victims' vertebrae to use them for 
necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Very clearly they believe the human sacrifices and the animal sacrifices put a 
magical shield around them that protected them from evil or harm, even up to 
bullets," said Texas Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kilroy, the dead included a Matamoros policeman, a Mexican 
federal police volunteer and a 16-year-old. As many as three of the dead may be 
American. 
</P>
<P>
The four men already in custody "didn't demonstrate any remorse at all," said 
Neck. "They were laughing and giggling." 
</P>
<P>
The quartet was paraded onto a second floor balcony Wednesday at the Matamoros 
headquarters of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police, while more than 100 
reporters from both sides of the border stood on the overgrown lawn below and 
shouted questions. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Martinez, 23, told the crowd that yes, he was guilty of kidnaping 
Kilroy. 
</P>
<P>
Serafin Hernandez Garcia, 22, an American from Brownsville, said that he was 
part of the kidnaping team. He, unlike the others, spoke in English. "We took 
him to the ranch," he said. "I didn't do nothing, but the other ones, they 
killed him. They killed him with a machete." 
</P>
<P>
Elio Hernandez Rivera, 22, whose father owns the ranch, said that some of the 
killings were out of vengeance, but others "we killed for protection." He said 
he shot and killed one victim and decapitated another. 
</P>
<P>
David Serna Valdez, 22, said they had to give chase to Kilroy, after he tried 
to escape. Why Kilroy? "No reason, he just happened to be there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican police said they had arrested a fifth suspect, but he was not brought 
forward. Mattox estimated that the ring smuggled about 1,000 pounds of 
marijuana a week into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
James Kilroy said his son "was afraid of narcotics but it was narcotics that 
killed Mark. Marijuana was what killed Mark."

District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry called Wednesday for a summit meeting 
of regional political leaders to deal with the area's drug and drug-related 
violence problem. 
</P>
<P>
Barry also pledged that city officials will work closely with national drug 
chief William J. Bennett to make the region a leader in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to ask the (region's) chief executive officers to come together in a 
private setting to talk frankly and confidentially about our tactics," Barry 
said at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a regional body of 
local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to work with Mr. Bennett," Barry said. "We're glad he's indicated 
this is a regional problem, not just a D.C. problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett on Monday announced an emergency $80-million federal plan to combat the 
city's escalating drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's plan includes measures to expand prison space, establish a 
local-federal anti-drug task force and temporarily assign 10 military 
prosecutors to the local U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said many of the open-air drug markets the city is targeting are near the 
city's borders with counties in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to push the drug dealers and drug pushers across the line into 
these counties," he said.

BUSH AWARE OF HONDURAN AID TIES; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL MEMOS SHOW THEN-V.P. WAS TOLD OF LINK TO CONTRAS

<P>
A White House document released in the trial of Oliver L. North indicates that 
President Bush, while vice president, was informed that U.S. military aid was 
being given to Honduras as a "quid pro quo" because of that country's help for 
Nicaragua's Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The document, a memorandum distributed at a 1985 Oval Office meeting attended 
by Bush, strengthens earlier indications that he was aware the Reagan 
Administration was promising aid to Honduras in exchange for help for the 
Contras at a time when Congress had prohibited U.S. aid "directly or 
indirectly" to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, signed by Robert C. McFarlane, then-President Ronald Reagan's 
national security adviser, urged Reagan to tell the visiting Honduran president 
of "the importance we attach to his continued cooperation in enabling the FDN 
(the main Contra organization) to remain a viable element of pressure" against 
the Nicaraguan government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Do Expect Cooperation' 
</P>
<P>
"Without making the linkage too explicit, it would be helpful to remind (the 
Hondurans) that in return for our help -- in the form of security assurances as 
well as aid -- we do expect cooperation in pursuit of our mutual objectives," 
the memo said. "In this regard, you could underline the seriousness of our 
security commitment, which the Hondurans seem to regard as the main quid pro 
quo for cooperating with the FDN." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, other documents released in the trial show that Bush 
did not act as a secret emissary to Honduras to broker a specific deal on aid 
for the Contras. Instead, the documents suggest that Bush was only one of 
several senior officials who promised U.S. aid and sought Honduran support for 
the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Bush's role in the Reagan Administration's secret campaign to 
persuade other countries to aid the rebels arose last week, when a court 
document revealed that he visited Honduras in March, 1985, and told the 
country's president that U.S. aid was being accelerated in response to a 
Honduran decision to help the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Another White House document released this week shows that officials of the 
White House National Security Council believed that seeking aid from Honduras 
for the rebels violated the intent of Congress' ban on Contra aid, even though 
it may have been technically legal. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Bush has denied any knowledge of the secret Contra aid operation 
organized by North, who was on the NSC staff in 1985. But he never has said 
whether he participated in attempts to obtain supplies and money from foreign 
governments. He has refused to comment on the disclosures from the North trial, 
arguing that to do so might affect the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've given a full accounting," the President told an audience of 
newspaper editors Wednesday. "Every attorney that advises the President has 
advised me not to do something that inadvertently would cause a mistrial or 
would disturb the process that is under way. And so, I don't like reading 
charges that I happen to feel are untrue, but I have to stand on that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush did point approvingly to comments from two officials who were 
present during his 1985 visit to Honduras, both of whom said that he discussed 
no explicit quid pro quo when he met with Honduran President Roberto Suazo 
Cordoba. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no goddamn quid pro quo," said Langhorne A. Motley, a former 
assistant secretary of state, in a telephone interview. "That's just b.s." 
</P>
<P>
Motley acknowledged that the United States used its military and economic aid 
as leverage to encourage Honduras to help the Contras. But he denied that such 
a linkage amounted to a quid pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
"You speed up the (aid) pipeline, and at the same time you tell him your 
concerns," Motley said. "That isn't a quid pro quo. . . . We don't work that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Several NSC documents released in the North trial refer explicitly to Honduran 
cooperation with the Contras as a "quid pro quo" or a "condition" for U.S. aid, 
but Motley said that Bush did not take that message to Suazo. "Maybe that was 
in the mind of some people to do that, but that's not how it ended up," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's name first appears in the documents on a Feb. 20, 1985, NSC memo, which 
was written as officials were debating the best way to pressure a balky 
Honduras toward providing more assistance to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the text of a proposed presidential message thanking Honduras for its 
support for the rebels and promising accelerated U.S. aid "to ensure that our 
appreciation manifests itself in more than words," there was a handwritten note 
by John M. Poindexter, then deputy national security adviser. "Add that we want 
VP to also discuss this matter with Suazo," it said. 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up memo from the NSC to the State Department stated that "the vice 
president will discuss with (Suazo) the issues raised" in the presidential 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Bush met with Suazo. They discussed Honduras' desire for a 
mutual security pact with the United States, military aid and the Contra issue, 
according to two officials who were present, Motley and John D. Negroponte, 
former ambassador to Honduras. But both Motley and Negroponte said that no 
explicit quid pro quo arrangement was mentioned at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Another NSC memo written on Feb. 20 shows that North and other officials were 
aware that their approach to Honduras would violate Congress' intent in banning 
indirect aid to the Contras.

BUSH'S ETHICS PROPOSALS FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS' OPPOSITION TO SOME PARTS LIKELY; PAY ISSUE SIDESTEPPED 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, saying that the American people are troubled by "brazen 
contempt for the letter or spirit" of ethics laws, Wednesday proposed a package 
of reforms including more stringent financial disclosure rules for federal 
officials, restrictions on lobbying by former members of Congress and a ban on 
some campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also called for a 25% pay increase for federal judges but stopped short of 
proposing a raise as well for members of Congress and employees of the 
executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress should have a pay increase," he said in a speech to the American 
Society of Newspaper Editors, where he announced the ethics package. But, he 
added, "there is no point, absolutely no point, in putting Congress through 
another traumatic bashing" now like the furor that led to the defeat of a 50% 
pay raise earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the reform package redeemed Bush's campaign promise to tighten 
ethics laws, but its prospects are unclear. Some congressional aides have 
suggested that it could be boosted if the pending ethics report on House 
Speaker Jim Wright's financial affairs triggers heightened public concern over 
the issue. Otherwise, it could be hamstrung by likely congressional opposition 
to a number of provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush sidestepped the question of congressional pay, Congress is the 
target of most of the new proposals in his package. The plan would impose 
several new rules and establish a new Congressional Ethics Office, with power 
to conduct public inquiries of allegations against members or their aides. 
Currently, such allegations are investigated in secret by the congressional 
ethics committees and often become public only if the committees vote to impose 
some penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, members of Congress and their aides would have to wait a 
year after leaving government before they could lobby former colleagues. A 
similar "cooling off period" already applies to executive branch workers. 
Congressmen also would be forbidden from voting on legislation that affects any 
company with which they are negotiating for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional staff members, although not the lawmakers themselves, would be 
covered by the federal conflict-of-interest law that forbids taking action that 
affects a company in which the individual has a personal stake. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Bush has proposed relatively few changes in the rules governing 
his own appointees in the executive branch. And some parts of his plan, such as 
providing a new tax break to assist government officials who must sell assets 
to avoid conflicts of interest, would loosen current restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aides say that the emphasis on Congress is justified because ethical rules 
for the legislative branch have been less stringent than those covering the 
rest of the government. The new plan is designed to put all three branches of 
the government -- the executive, the legislative and the judiciary -- on the 
same level, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people do not understand why certain behavior is considered 
criminal when committed by an executive branch official (but is) perfectly 
legal when committed by someone in another branch," Bush said in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
The package disappointed some outside groups that have campaigned for more 
dramatic overhauls of the federal ethics code. In particular, critics argue 
that Bush should have endorsed a ban on speech and appearances fees for members 
of Congress. Such honorariums can add nearly $36,000 to the income of some 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "caved in to pressure by members of Congress who want to keep this corrupt 
system going," complained Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the 
citizens lobby. Bush aides countered that proposing to eliminate honorariums 
without recommending a pay raise would only alienate Congress. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the ethics proposals are highly technical, a few of the changes 
would have a clearly noticeable effect. For example, government officials 
would, under Bush's plan, have to report exactly how much money they have, 
rather than reporting their income and wealth only in broad ranges that 
effectively conceal much of their net worth. Officials also would be required 
to report the amount of money they borrow from relatives, something they 
currently do not have to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposed campaign finance reform would eliminate contributions directly 
to candidates by special interest political action committees. Rather, PACs 
would be allowed to contribute to political parties, which, in turn, would 
divide the money they received among their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, critics have charged that direct contributions tended to protect 
incumbents, making challenges by other candidates difficult and locking in the 
parties' competitive positions in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also has proposed that members of Congress be banned from converting 
campaign funds to personal use. Congress already has forbidden most members 
from converting campaign funds to other uses but included a "grandfather 
clause" for those who were in Congress before 1980. Effectively, that clause 
has allowed some of Congress' most senior members to amass nest eggs worth 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, a practice that Bush would end. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions, he said, "should not become a sort of individual 
retirement account for members of the United States Congress." 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session with the editors, Bush defended the pace 
of the federal government's involvement in fighting the oil spill in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound, pointing to the contributions of the Coast Guard and 
stating that the government moved "more quickly and more boldly than it gets 
credit for." 
</P>
<P>
The President signaled that he would veto a revision in the broadcasting 
Fairness Doctrine, now making its way through Congress. A similar bill was 
vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
And, asked by the father of a 12-year-old black child whether the young girl 
might some day be President, Bush said: "I hope that the progress this country 
has made and will make in the future will guarantee that a black teen-ager 
today, female, might well be President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

PENTAGON PANEL BACKS CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO BASE MX MISSILES ON MOVING RAIL CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a month after a compromise appeared near on the best way to modernize 
America's land-based nuclear missile force, a Pentagon advisory panel has 
revived a controversial plan to keep some missiles moving on rail lines at all 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The still-secret draft recommendation by the prestigious Defense Science Board 
endorses deployment of 50 MX missiles on rail cars, most of which would be 
housed inside garrisons at 11 military bases across the country. 
</P>
<P>
But in a move that could sink the program when it reaches Capitol Hill, the 
panel will recommend that a portion of the missile force should be dispersed on 
the nation's rail lines around the clock, according to two members of the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odds for Bush OK Increase 
</P>
<P>
Because the panel's recommendations carry considerable weight, defense experts 
said that the proposal increases the odds that the Bush Administration will 
embrace a rail-garrison basing plan for its force of MX missiles, which 
currently are housed in missile silos. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the proposal is sure to rekindle congressional concerns about 
the safety of ferrying multiple-warhead nuclear missiles along some 150,000 
miles of commercial rail lines in peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's findings, to be presented soon to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, 
come just as the Bush Administration nears a final decision on modernization of 
America's arsenal of long-range, land-based missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Air Force officials and key lawmakers were close to an agreement to 
keep all of the nation's MX missiles housed in railside garrisons except during 
periods of international crisis, at which time they would be dispersed on rail 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement also called for building a force of smaller, 
single-warhead Midgetman missiles that would be transported by trucks within 
large military reservations. The Midgetman plan has been favored by many 
members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Administration adopts the Defense Science Board proposal to keep 
some MX missiles in motion at all times, Congress is likely to reject the 
scheme, knowledgeable congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon and Congress have scuttled two previous rail-based missile 
programs, one for the Minuteman missile in the early 1960s and one for the MX 
during the Jimmy Carter Administration, because they called for the constant 
presence of nuclear weapons on commercial byways. 
</P>
<P>
Since proposing its own rail-garrison scheme in December, 1986, the Air Force 
has taken pains to reassure communities on railroad lines that loaded weapons 
would leave their garrisons only in times of international crisis. 
</P>
<P>
By raising the specter that such weapons would be a constant presence on 
railroads, MX proponents fear that the panel's recommendation could further 
erode public support for the rail-garrison scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's recommendations also appear to bolster the principal argument used 
by opponents of the rail-garrison concept -- that it could not survive a 
surprise Soviet nuclear strike. 
</P>
<P>
Critics fear that in an unexpected attack, the missile force would be destroyed 
while still in its rail-side garrisons because U.S. leaders either would not 
have advance warning or would delay putting the trains in motion. Unless most 
of the missile trains are dispersed on rail lines, Air Force officials 
acknowledge that much of the MX force could be destroyed in a surprise strike. 
</P>
<P>
In concluding that some part of the missile force should be on the tracks at 
all times, the Defense Science Board tacitly acknowledged that even during 
periods of international crisis, U.S. leaders would be hesitant to disperse the 
trains for fear that doing so would further escalate tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"The essential thing is to get people to believe that you haven't locked the 
missile trains up and thrown the key away," said one panel member who asked not 
to be identified. "If some have been out on the rails all along, that erodes 
any hurdle you might imagine" to dispersing the entire force during a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel argued also that a commitment to place some missile trains 
on round-the-clock patrol would make safety precautions adopted by the Air 
Force to protect the public "more serious-minded." 
</P>
<P>
"Putting (MX missiles) on a train and leaving them in their garrisons is no 
better than putting them in Minuteman silos," where they currently are based, 
said Gen. Russell E. Dougherty, a member of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respected Panel 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Science Board, which is composed of respected scientists, engineers 
and former defense officials, is considered one of the Defense Department's 
most authoritative advisory panels. Its recommendations often are adopted as 
department policy. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is chaired by Dr. James R. Burnett, an executive at TRW's Space and 
Defense Sector in Redondo Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
In endorsing the rail-garrison concept, the Defense Science Board echoed the 
Air Force view that the system would provide the greatest deterrent effect for 
the least amount of money. The Air Force estimates that it would cost $5.4 
billion to place the 50 existing MX missiles on 25 trains and keep them in 
garrisons.

STATE AUDIT SAYS LOTTERY SHORTCHANGES SCHOOLS

The California Lottery improperly diverted millions of dollars in unclaimed 
Lotto 6/49 prizes back into jackpots instead of giving the money to public 
schools as required by law, according to a state controller's office audit 
scheduled for release today. 
</P>
<P>
The audit for the 1987-88 fiscal year shows that the state-run lottery 
"shortchanged schools millions of dollars" by channeling $5 prizes that went 
unclaimed into the prize pools for future Lotto drawings, controller's office 
spokesman Edd Fong told the Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb acknowledged the allocation of unclaimed $5 
prizes to future prize pools, but disputed the controller's office 
interpretation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 initiative that created the lottery does not require the $5 prizes to 
go to schools when they are unclaimed, McNabb said. The $5 prizes are paid 
directly by lottery retailers to holders of tickets with three out of the six 
winning numbers in each drawing. Only the larger prizes that are paid directly 
by the lottery must go to schools when they are not collected by winners, 
McNabb contended. 
</P>
<P>
Controller's office representatives and education officials, in interviews, 
rejected her argument. The lottery has asked the state attorney general's 
office for an opinion clarifying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb further discounted the contention that schools had been shortchanged, 
pointing out that the lottery has given schools more than the 34% of total 
proceeds required by the initiative. The extra money came from savings on 
administration of the games, she said. 
</P>
<P>
State Schools Supt. Bill Honig joined the controller's office in saying that 
the obvious intent of the initiative was to give unclaimed prize money to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"To play legal games (with the interpretation of the initiative) is out of 
line. . . . They are bending over backwards not to give us the money," Honig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
State Education Department spokeswoman Susie Lange added that if it is 
determined that schools are being shorted, "We will pursue whatever remedy is 
necessary to reclaim whatever is due schools." 
</P>
<P>
Honig was scheduled to join Controller Gray Davis in unveiling the 25-page 
audit today.

FATE OF BORDER CRIME SQUAD IS STILL UP IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top San Diego police and U.S. Border Patrol officials met Wednesday and 
discussed the future of an embattled border anti-crime squad, but authorities 
said no decision had been made on the future of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen and Dale W. Cozart, chief Border Patrol agent in San 
Diego, both accompanied by top aides, discussed the issue and agreed to meet 
again next week to ponder the squad's fate anew, said Police Capt. Dick Toneck, 
department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"They're looking at a whole series of new ways of doing business, or maybe 
going back to the old way," said Toneck, who supervised the unit during the 
year he served as captain of the police southern division. 
</P>
<P>
The unique law enforcement squad -- known as the Border Crime Prevention Unit 
-- has been largely on hold since Jan. 4, when Border Patrol officers assigned 
to the outfit shot and killed two Mexican men who, according to U.S. 
authorities, attacked the officers with screwdrivers and a knife. After the 
shootings, the Mexican government, citing what it considered an excessive use 
of force, requested a thorough investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Rejected 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing the families of the dead men then filed two 
$15-million claims against the patrol, contending that the pair were shot as 
they were running back to Mexico. U.S. officials, acknowledging that the men 
were shot in the back, said the shootings nonetheless appeared to be justified 
by the threat. Federal authorities have rejected the claim by the dead men's 
families. The families' attorney, Marco Lopez of San Diego, plans a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the controversy, U.S. authorities took the unit out of action, 
saying its methods were being re-evaluated. The squad, whose members have been 
assigned to other duties, has now been inactive for more than three months, the 
longest such break since the outfit was formed five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, whose members patrol in uniform, is a successor to the undercover 
squad of San Diego police officers whose exploits during 1976-78 were 
chronicled by author Joseph Wambaugh in the book "Lines and Shadows." That 
outfit was disbanded in 1978, after several highly publicized shooting 
incidents, when then-Chief of Police William Kolender determined that the duty 
was too risky. After it was taken out of action in 1978, there was no border 
anti-crime squad until the current unit began patrolling the border in early 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The furor surrounding the January shootings also prompted an inquiry by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was probing possible civil rights 
violations. The inquiry has been completed and its results will soon be 
forwarded to the Justice Department in Washington to determine if any further 
legal action is warranted, said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman in San Diego. He 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unit in a Unique Position 
</P>
<P>
The border unit is composed of about a dozen police officers and Border Patrol 
</P>
<P>
agents, all of whom volunteer for the assignments, working four-month shifts 
and patrolling the border area in the evenings. The squad is designed to cut 
down on crime against the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who 
enter San Diego from Mexico each year, often hiking through rough canyons or 
traversing the hazardous Tijuana River area, where many are victimized by 
thieves. The unit is in the unique position of defending people who are, by 
definition, lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
However, the unit has amassed a record of violence that critics say is 
excessive. In its five years of existence, officers assigned to the squad have 
shot 44 suspects, 18 of whom have died, at least half shot from behind, many 
shot numerous times. The dozen or so lawmen assigned to the unit at a given 
time have killed more people during its five-year history than the entire San 
Diego police force, which is composed of more than 1,500 officers, during the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
In each fatal-shooting case, the uniformed officers said they were attacked in 
the border darkness, provoking their response. U.S. authorities have denied 
that the officers deliberately act as decoys -- the provocative operating 
method of the previous border unit that was eventually disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, representing the American Friends Service Committee, social 
action arm of the Quaker Church, has called for the disbanding of the squad, 
which he maintains is too violent and has shot too many innocent victims. But 
authorities in San Diego, maintaining that each person killed was indeed a 
violent thief, have said they plan to redeploy the unit, although how it will 
eventually be constituted remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make it more safe and more efficient for the agents out 
there," said Norbert Gomez, a Border Patrol spokesman.

SEA WORLD EXPERTS HOPE TO SAVE LAST OF 5 OTTERS SENT FROM ALASKA OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sea World's sea otter specialists are holding a 24-hour vigil over the sole 
survivor among five Alaskan sea otters rescued from oily Prince William Sound 
and brought to San Diego last week after the worst oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Like the four that died from hypothermia and ingesting crude oil, the last 
otter is suffering from liver damage. But it has started to regenerate the 
natural body oils that help keep its fur waterproof, and no other otter has 
recovered enough to do this, park officials say. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure exactly how good its chances are for survival. Senior animal 
care specialist Nolan Harvey says: "She's not out of the woodwork yet. We still 
have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intensive Care 
</P>
<P>
But with more than 20 animal care specialists, curators and veterinarians at 
Sea World providing round-the-clock care, General Curator Jim Antrim is 
optimistic: "It's on the way back. It's heading in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the battery of experts working in San Diego, a team of Sea World 
Research Institute scientists are heading otter-cleaning efforts in Valdez, 
Alaska. Both ends have laid important groundwork in the event of another oil 
spill, which in California could seriously endanger the local otter population, 
estimated at about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Sea World Research Institute scientists Dr. Randall Davis and 
Dr. Terrie Williams tried to clean oiled otters with various commercial 
cleansers and special grease removers. Their breakthrough discovery: liquid 
detergent and water. 
</P>
<P>
Their research also involved developing techniques for capturing, sedating and 
monitoring the animals but the contingency plan their findings resulted in was 
not actually implemented until the Exxon Valdez spilled more than 10 million 
gallons into the once-pristine Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 100 otters have been brought to a recovery center in 
Valdez but more than 50 have died, according to Bruce Batten, a spokesman for 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
"Not more than 10% to 20% of those oiled otters that we have recovered alive 
are we expecting to survive, and that's with all the care we can give them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip Too Stressful 
</P>
<P>
Five otters plucked from the sound were flown to Los Angeles and trucked to San 
Diego last Monday where they received extra attention, but wildlife authorities 
do not expect to send any more. Travel has proven too stressful, Batten said, 
and a new facility that can hold up to 120 recuperating otters has been built 
at Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
New information gathered from watching the five otters sent to San Diego, 
including regular blood test results, diet habits and other observations, has 
been sent to the scientists in Valdez. Information has also been relayed 
between the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, the Point Defiance Aquarium in Tacoma, 
Wash. and the Vancouver Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
"It was (initially) presumed that the most significant thing was the de-oiling, 
was to immediately get the oil off their fur," Antrim said. Later, as the 
animals deteriorated, the fact that they were suffering from ingesting oil 
became more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Several Sea World animal care specialists knew R.V. Chalam, a San Diego 
toxicologist with a background in veterinary medicine, and asked him for help. 
An activated charcoal solution was developed and a paste created by mixing the 
charcoal with water was fed to the otters through stomach tubes, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lesson Learned 
</P>
<P>
The solution helps carry through the otters' digestive tracts hydrocarbons in 
the ingested oil. This means the oil passes out of the digestive tract as waste 
rather than circulating through the animal and destroying its liver and 
kidneys, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
The overall lesson learned by all this research? 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing is it's not only important to remove exterior oil but if you 
have the tools, like a charcoal flush, start taking measures against internal 
oil because that seems to be the more lethal influence," Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lone survivor at Sea World now weighs about 40 pounds and spends 
most of her time dining on shrimp, crab, sea urchins and clams, grooming her 
fur and getting some much-needed rest.

CARPENTER COULD GET NEW TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE FINDS JURY MISCONDUCT IN TRAILSIDE KILLINGS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A judge's finding Wednesday of jury misconduct during David J. Carpenter's 
trial and conviction in five Northern California trailside killings could lead 
to a new trial for the San Francisco man. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the finding, Superior Court Judge Herbert Hoffman took no immediate 
action regarding the verdict against Carpenter last May in San Diego and the 
subsequent death penalty sentence for the 1980 park killings in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman gave Marin County prosecutors until May 1 to file papers on why the 
misconduct should not result in a new trial for Carpenter, 58. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were given until May 22 to file their replies and then both 
sides will come back to court June 1 to argue their respective positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three-Month Hearing 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling followed a hearing stretched over three months involving 
allegations that jury forewoman Barbara Durham of Julian improperly knew that 
Carpenter already had been sentenced to death for two similar 1981 killings in 
Santa Cruz County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident my decision is a correct one, but it does not please me," 
Hoffman said. "I think we need to proceed very carefully because I am 
absolutely convinced the evidence, beyond a shadow of a doubt, shows Mr. 
Carpenter is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether this juror misconduct is something that will overturn this conviction 
is something we'll have to decide." 
</P>
<P>
The judge apologized to victims' relatives who traveled to San Diego to sit 
through Carpenter's trial after it was moved on a change of venue motion 
because of extensive publicity about the case in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judicial System Isn't Perfect 
</P>
<P>
"This has to be something that is going to be devastating to them," Hoffman 
said of the potential for a retrial. "Our judicial system is the best in the 
world, but it's not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Besides seeking a retrial, the motion filed by Carpenter's attorneys asks that 
the death penalty imposed on him last year be vacated. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing on the defense motion, two acquaintances of Durham testified 
that she indicated in a dinner conversation that she had knowledge of 
Carpenter's role in the Santa Cruz killings. The conversation occurred last 
March, midway through Carpenter's six-month trial, as Durham and her husband 
dined with the two at an eastern San Diego County restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys contend that left her unable to impartially consider the 
evidence because of Hoffman's pretrial ruling, which barred jurors from knowing 
about Carpenter's previous conviction and death sentence in the Santa Cruz 
aspects of case. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lustig, a San Diego businessman, and his former girlfriend, Barbara 
Duran, both quoted Durham as saying: "I'm not supposed to know this, but the 
defendant has been convicted of doing the same thing in another county and has 
been sentenced to death." 
</P>
<P>
Durham denied she made such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Memory Was Selective' 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said, however, that Durham appeared extremely nervous when she took the 
stand to respond to the allegations and added that he felt her "memory was 
selective." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would leave it up to the San Diego County district attorney's 
office to decide whether criminal charges should be filed because of the 
alleged jury misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
During closing arguments Tuesday, Marin County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Posey 
questioned why Lustig took several months to tell anyone about Durham's 
purported statement. He claimed Lustig was trying to throw a "monkey wrench" 
into the system. 
</P>
<P>
Marin County Public Defender Stephen Berlin suggested that Lustig waited as 
long as he did because of concern that he would be viewed as someone who helped 
a convicted murderer get away with his crimes and the financial repercussions 
that might have on his business. 
</P>
<P>
"He's intelligent, a man of principle . . . (and) someone concerned with the 
rules of the game," Berlin told Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with Berlin, saying he found Lustig to be a "complex 
personality but a credible witness." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reward for Mr. Lustig, given the general public's feeling about 
this case. If he wanted publicity, it would have been easier to come straight 
out instead of using an attorney," Hoffman said.

IMPORT OF KILLER WHALE BY SEA WORLD OPPOSED; PROBE OF DEATH URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATE CALLEN, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials reviewing a Sea World request for a permit to import a killer 
whale from Brazil are looking into charges that a popular killer whale may have 
died of starvation at the marine park last year, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about drastic weight loss suffered by Orky after he came to Sea World 
in 1987 were voiced to the National Marine Fisheries Service in a March 8 
letter from Monitor, a Washington, D.C.-based consortium of conservation and 
animal welfare groups. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Monitor official Craig van Note urged federal officials to 
review the full necropsy report on Orky before issuing Sea World a permit to 
import a female killer whale now at Acuarama, a marine park in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which Sea World furnished to NMFS to defend its practices, listed 
the official cause of death as "acute bronchopneumonia resulting from the 
weakened state associated with chronic weight loss," and said veterinarians had 
tried to save Orky by increasing his food intake and treating him with 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost One-Third of Weight 
</P>
<P>
Van Note cited other Sea World reports that Orky lost 4,400 pounds, or 
one-third of his body weight, between his transfer to Sea World in February, 
1987, from a marine park outside Los Angeles and his death in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disturbed that a large, healthy animal, under constant supervision by 
experienced personnel, could lose more than 4,000 pounds in such a 
comparatively short time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been suggested that food deprivation may be employed as a training 
technique for the killer whales, and other marine mammals, at Sea World. . . . 
We hope it will be possible to ascertain to what extent, if any, food 
deprivation has been employed by personnel at the several Sea World 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
In a March 22 letter to NMFS responding to Monitor's charges, the marine park 
chain's zoological director Edward D. Asper said, "It is Sea World's policy not 
to restrict the diet of our animals for training purposes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Discretion 
</P>
<P>
"Under the supervision of our veterinary staff, trainers have limited 
discretion in terms of the allocation of food as long as the animal meets its 
dietary requirements," Asper added. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Terbush, chief of the NMFS permit division, said Wednesday the agency is 
looking into Monitor's charges and six other complaints about Sea World 
practices raised after the application permit was published in February. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our policy to look into any comments or concerns that are raised before 
we make a final decision," Terbush said. 
</P>
<P>
The review should be complete and the permit either approved or denied "within 
a couple of weeks," Terbush said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Orky's death, Sea World general curator Jim Antrim said the 
28-year-old killer whale died "of an advanced geriatric condition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injured a Trainer 
</P>
<P>
Orky, considered the patriarch of Sea World's killer whale herd, gained 
notoriety in November, 1987, for injuring a trainer during a performance. 
</P>
<P>
Just three days before Orky's death on Sept. 26, 1988, a calf he sired, Baby 
Shamu, was born during a park show before nearly 2,000 spectators in the San 
Diego Shamu Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bob Hofman, scientific program director for the National Marine Mammal 
Commission, said Orky's weight loss "certainly is not inconsistent" with the 
effects of old age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Reasons for Weight Loss 
</P>
<P>
"Weight loss can be caused by a whole host of things," including old age, 
stress or immobility, Hofman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hofman said Orky, acquired by Sea World in 1987 when it completed a hard-fought 
purchase of Marineland, a Palos Verdes marine park, was thought to be the 
oldest killer whale ever in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc said the application for a permit to import the 
killer whale from the Sao Paulo park is the only such request Sea World has 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Sea World was given a permit to capture killer whales in the Pacific 
Northwest. Terbush termed that decision "very controversial" and said that, 
following prolonged objections from environmentalists and Alaska state 
officials, the permit was invalidated by federal court order in January, 1985.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT CONVICTED IN COCAINE SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal jury in Salt Lake City has returned a guilty verdict against a West 
Covina man arrested in what authorities said was Utah's largest cocaine 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Enrique Arango, 27, was convicted on one count of possession of 220 
pounds of cocaine with intent to distribute. Judge Bruce Jenkins scheduled 
sentencing for June 12 for Arango, who faces up to life in prison and a fine of 
$4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Because of insufficient evidence, charges were dropped against a 
co-defefendant, Nazly Correa, 30, of La Puente, who was allowed to return to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, both Colombian nationals, were stopped for speeding last Nov. 16 
on Interstate 70, and a subsequent search of the vehicle uncovered the cocaine, 
estimated to be worth more than $2 million.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third year running, a grand prix auto race will roar at the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds, as the California Coastal Commission granted final approval for 
the October event. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 9 to 2 on Tuesday to give the race a green light after a 
half-hour hearing that was noticeably free of complaints from nearby residents, 
who had lashed out against the event in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Lily Cervantes and Charles Warren voted against the event, with 
Cervantes concerned about the impacts of noise and crowds on wildlife in the 
nearby San Dieguito Lagoon and Warren worried that residents were still 
suffering from the race. 
</P>
<P>
The only other note of controversy was voiced by Del Mar Mayor John Gillies and 
Councilwoman Brooke Eisenberg, who said neighbors were troubled by noise at 
last year's event caused by a low-flying helicopter that was needed to relay 
transmissions from on-board cameras in the race cars. 
</P>
<P>
Race promoters said the helicopter will not be allowed to fly below 1,500 feet 
this year, a height that commission staffers suggested would adequately curtail 
noise in surrounding neighborhoods.

An egg laid Sunday by a California condor at the San Diego Wild Animal Park is 
fertile, park spokesman Tom Hanscom said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials used a "candling" technique to determine whether an embryo was 
developing inside the egg, the second produced this year by a pair of condors 
named UN-1 and AC-4. 
</P>
<P>
"This is their double-clutch egg," Hanscom said. The pair's first egg of the 
year, laid Feb. 21, was taken from the birds with the hope that they would 
"double clutch," or produce another egg to replace the one taken. That first 
egg is expected to hatch between mid- to late next week. The two also produced 
Molloko in March, 1988, the first condor chick conceived and hatched in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The egg, discovered about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, was removed from the nesting area 
of female UN-1 and male AC-4 and replaced with a ceramic egg, Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided it was too late in the (mating) season to expect a triple-clutch 
this year. We replaced the egg because we are interested in observing nesting 
behavior by these birds and we don't want to risk a real egg to do that 
behavior research," Hanscom said. "It's our hope that they will exhibit normal 
nesting behavior and . . . take turns at the nest, at which time we will 
replace the ceramic egg with an Andean (condor) egg laid here." 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom said that although it is getting late in the season, some condors at 
the park are still displaying mating behavior. "There are no immediate egg-lay 
watches, but we still keep our fingers crossed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven condor eggs have been laid this year. Four were fertile, two were 
infertile and one was broken in the nest. 
</P>
<P>
The 28 California condors that remain, divided between the Los Angeles Zoo and 
the Wild Animal Park, are in a breeding program to replenish the species for 
release into their former range.

SUIT THREAT KEEPS EMERGENCY ROOM OPEN AT CENTINELA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Centinela Hospital Medical Center said Wednesday that it will delay a plan to 
close its emergency room to patients brought in by paramedics until next month 
in an effort to reach an agreement to treat only obstetric cases that arrive by 
rescue ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood hospital's decision came after three public-interest law groups 
threatened to sue the hospital unless it delayed its decision. The hospital has 
state approval to stop taking public-ambulance patients as of April 26. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has said it will continue to provide emergency services to 
patients who arrive on their own or by private ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Because Centinela is the only hospital in its area that has an obstetrics unit, 
its decision has sent county health officials scurrying to find another 
hospital to treat obstetric patients. The county is negotiating with Marina 
Hills Hospital in Ladera Hills to provide that service. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, fearing that it could face a 
large influx of obstetric patients if the county's negotiations fail, has also 
filed for state approval to stop treating patients brought by paramedics as of 
April 26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided After Talks 
</P>
<P>
Russell Stromberg, Centinela's president, said the hospital decided to delay 
the planned closure after talking with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles 
-- one of three groups that has threatened to sue it. 
</P>
<P>
Legal aid attorneys told Centinela officials that the hospital may be able to 
reach an agreement with state and county officials that would allow it to treat 
only obstetric patients brought in by paramedics and refuse other types of 
patients, Stromberg said. 
</P>
<P>
That would lessen the financial burden Centinela faces in treating indigent 
patients of all types, Stromberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were under the impression legally that we could not just take obstetric 
patients," Stromberg said. "They feel there is a way to structure a contract 
where we can." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Kennedy said the hospital would "look very favorably" on 
remaining a paramedic base station if Centinela or any other hospital continues 
to treat obstetric patients. County and state health officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela officials cited ballooning debts in winning state approval March 17 
to stop accepting patients brought in by paramedics. The hospital said that in 
fiscal 1988 it carried $8.4 million in unpaid bills and donated services. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Foundation, as well as the Western Center on Law and Poverty and 
the National Health Law Program, sent a letter to Centinela on Monday, saying 
they intended to file a class-action lawsuit against the hospital unless it 
agreed to postpone its decision. 
</P>
<P>
The groups contended in their letter that the hospital's decision violates 
federal law by discriminating against patients based on their ability to pay 
for medical services. 
</P>
<P>
"They called back and said, 'What can we do to work this out?' " said Byron 
Gross, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation. "We have agreed we won't sue 
them now while they hold off for 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
Stromberg said Tuesday that he doubts that the groups have any legal grounds to 
sue the hospital. If the groups are going to sue anyone, he asserted, it should 
be the government agencies responsible for funding medical care programs for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"They got the wrong target," Stromberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Inglewood City Council on Tuesday voted 
unanimously to stop sending injured police and fire personnel to Centinela for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, council members agreed to send that business -- estimated at about 
$250,000 a year -- to neighboring Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Centinela's decision Wednesday, Norman Cravens, Inglewood's 
assistant city manager, said: "I guess the bottom line is there would be no 
reason to change what the council did immediately." 
</P>
<P>
But Cravens said the council could reconsider its action if Centinela's 
emergency room remains open to paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Cravens said city employees will be better served by 
Freeman because the hospital will continue to belong to the county's paramedic 
system should Centinela drop out. Hence, radio contact with the city's rescue 
ambulances and Freeman can be maintained during emergencies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cravens said, the city wanted to reward Freeman because it has 
continued to care for patients brought in by ambulance even though it is losing 
millions of dollars a year as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give business to a hospital that keeps its emergency room open to 
all indigents in Inglewood," Cravens said. 
</P>
<P>
Stromberg called the council's action "purely political" and motivated by 
Centinela's decision last March to sue the city to prevent the construction of 
a center for severely mentally ill patients across the street from the 
hospital. Centinela filed the suit after the council approved construction of 
the 14-bed facility.

SLAYING BY INGLEWOOD POLICE TRIGGERS RARE LATINO PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Inglewood's Latino community, which has been almost invisible in the city's 
political life, emerged into the spotlight this week, protesting the death of a 
businessman's son shot by police April 5 after a two-hour chase. 
</P>
<P>
After the funeral of 23-year-old Javier Arreola Monday, about 150 friends and 
family members marched outside Inglewood City Hall, calling for justice and 
accusing the police of mistreating Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Inglewood Police Chief Raymond Johnson emphatically rejected 
protesters' allegations that racism played a role in Arreola's death. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said officers had no idea what Arreola's ethnicity was before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely ridiculous," Johnson said. "The officers had no way of knowing 
who or what he was. And it wouldn't have mattered anyway. That's foolish." 
</P>
<P>
A predominantly Latino demonstration is a rare event in Inglewood. Latinos have 
generally kept a low profile in the city, where the power structure is 
dominated by blacks and whites. Latinos rarely attend City Council and school 
board meetings and have no elected representatives, although they constitute 
30% of the city's population and about 44% of the school district's population. 
</P>
<P>
But two days before the Arreola shooting, Jose Fernandez, an aide to state Sen. 
Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), outpolled four other candidates in the District 3 City 
Council election April 4 to qualify for a June runoff against Bruce Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino community is "waking up," Fernandez said Tuesday. "I'm sure this has 
stirred up a lot of emotions. They feel they want to be included in the system. 
They want their opinions taken into consideration, like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Of Arreola's death, Fernandez said: "It's a total tragedy for everyone. For the 
officers, for the family, for the city." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Arreola's father, Lennox bakery owner Francisco 
Arreola, disagreed with statements by other relatives and family friends 
accusing the police of anti-Latino bias. But he denounced the police for his 
son's death, which he called "a crime." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Arreola's family retained Inglewood attorney Harold Sullivan, who 
said he is preparing a lawsuit against the Inglewood police. Sullivan said an 
independent autopsy commissioned by the family this weekend showed that Arreola 
was shot four times in the back and the back of the head at a range of about 
three feet with a .357 Magnum. He questioned the necessity of shooting the 
unarmed man and questioned the police versions of how and why the shooting took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the police overreacted," Sullivan said. "I believe the officer who 
shot him became too emotionally involved. We know from police psychologists 
that people become angered in a chase situation. I think (Arreola) was cowering 
behind the wheel. How many times do we hear police say 'He reached for a 
weapon'. . . . I don't understand why he was shot four times in the back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
D.A. Investigating 
</P>
<P>
As in all officer-involved shootings, the Los Angeles County district attorney 
is investigating, along with the Inglewood Police Department. The Los Angeles 
Police Department is also investigating because the incident took place in its 
jurisdiction. The investigations should be complete within the month, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The early morning shooting took place on the Santa Monica Freeway near La Brea 
after officers shot out Arreola's tires. Police say officers fired after 
Arreola ignored commands to surrender, backed up his van toward the officers 
and ducked under the dashboard as if reaching for a weapon. No weapon was 
discovered in the van. Officers said they found almost two ounces of cocaine 
and added that Arreola's mouth and nose were smeared with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Arreola ignored commands to surrender in both Spanish and English 
during the chase and after he came to a stop. He said officers fired from the 
back and sides of the van after Arreola started to back the van toward them and 
ducked down in the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he did not know whether the independent autopsy's report that the 
shots that killed Arreola were fired from a distance of three feet is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"He had adequate time to surrender," Johnson said. "He did not respond to 
orders. We don't like it, we don't relish the loss of a life. But it started 
with him, not with us." 
</P>
<P>
The 100-mile chase from Inglewood to Riverside County and back to West Los 
Angeles began when Arreola fled from police cars responding to a midnight call 
from a guard at an Inglewood construction site. Police said the guard reported 
that Arreola's van had been circling the site and that a hole had been made in 
a fence. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola had a list of construction materials in the van that he needed for a 
market he planned to open in Inglewood. Family members say police told them 
that Arreola probably intended to rob the construction site, although police 
have not said a theft occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Sullivan said Wednesday that Latinos in Inglewood feel that the police 
discriminate against them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common knowledge in the community that the police come down harder on 
Hispanics than other groups," Sullivan said. Latinos "have generally been very 
pacific, but they feel wronged in this case. They feel too much force was 
used." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Police Sgt. Harold Moret said the department does not discriminate 
against anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider ourselves a caring, compassionate department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehemence of the protest comes partly because the dead man was the son of a 
prominent businessman. Francisco Arreola owns the Arreola bakery, a fixture on 
the bustling Inglewood Avenue corridor in Lennox, and has been working to 
increase Latino political presence in the Inglewood area. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, Arreola and Inglewood 
businessman Jose Marrero formed the Inglewood-Lennox Latin American Chamber of 
Commerce last year. Arreola was involved in several City Council campaigns 
during last week's election, supporting candidates including Fernandez; the 
bakery van in which Javier Arreola died bore signs promoting Fernandez's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola said in an interview Tuesday that he disagreed with charges that racism 
was an element in the shooting, saying demonstrators made those statements in 
the heat of emotion. But he called for a full investigation of his son's 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know why they killed him," Arreola said in Spanish. "The law applies 
to everyone, including the police. I want to know the truth about what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola is a husky, stolid man who remains more comfortable speaking Spanish 
than English 22 years after he arrived in the United States from Mexico. He 
worked in a factory for seven years, then opened the family bakery where 
Javier, one of seven children and the elder of two sons, worked along with 
other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola considers himself a loving but tough father. He admits that Javier 
succumbed to drugs and other bad influences as a youth attending Lennox 
schools. Arreola himself called police and had his son arrested in 1986 when he 
discovered that Javier had stolen money from the family business. 
</P>
<P>
Javier served six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Francisco Arreola said, he and his son had reconciled, and Javier 
was building a new life. Along with an uncle, Javier was preparing to open a 
mini-mart on Arbor Vitae in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wasn't Violent' 
</P>
<P>
"He worked at my side at the bakery," Arreola said. "He had been married for 
two and a half years with two children. He was excited about the new business. 
He wasn't violent or aggressive. He didn't own a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Arreola attended the Inglewood City Council meeting with Marrero, 
the head of the Latin American Chamber of Commerce. Unlike Monday, there were 
no angry words or picket signs. Javier Arreola's father stood silent at the 
speaker's podium next to Marrero, who addressed the council on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"All we want is justice," Marrero said. "Too many questions have to be answered 
on how this happened. We request a complete inquiry and investigation, and we 
request that the results be made public."

WYSOCKI WINNER IN WILMINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
FLORES UPBEAT AFTER EASY COUNCIL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores scored an easy reelection victory in 
Tuesday's municipal primary, but unofficial returns show that the two-term 
incumbent lost in Wilmington to challenger Jo Ann Wysocki by more than 4% of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The returns from Wilmington's 20 precincts show that Wysocki, vice president of 
Wilmington's largest homeowner organization, won 52.3% of the vote to Flores' 
47.7%. Districtwide, Flores trounced Wysocki, 72.3% to 27.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just local pride in your former honorary mayor or your blond 
school teacher," said Wysocki, an elementary school teacher in Huntington Park 
who served as Wilmington's honorary mayor in 1988. "This blond school teacher 
had the gumption to go out there and say what others have been saying. Maybe 
this time (Flores) will listen." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, asked early Wednesday how she would react if precinct returns showed 
she had lost in Wilmington, said she would be unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of friends and supporters in Wilmington and people working for 
me," Flores said. "Besides, that is the area where (Wysocki) concentrated her 
campaign. If there was that trend, we will turn it around. By the end of the 
next four years, there is going to be such a snowball effect going on with the 
enthusiasm in the community because of the things we initiated there long 
before the campaign started." 
</P>
<P>
Wysocki, who has been one of Flores' harshest critics since becoming involved 
in Wilmington affairs in 1982, charged during the campaign that Flores has 
neglected the industrial port-side community. She complained about poorly swept 
streets, illegally parked trucks, inadequate police patrols and a general lack 
of city services. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has heard the complaints for several years from Wilmington and in recent 
years has worked to mend relations with the increasingly vocal and demanding 
community. Although she acknowledges that she has not won over all her critics, 
in an interview before the election Flores pointed to her work in Wilmington as 
her greatest accomplishment during her second term. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, she pointed to her efforts to revitalize downtown Wilmington, 
provide waterfront access to residents, control construction of apartment 
buildings, require oil companies to landscape oil wells and provide funding for 
the new Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
Several Wilmington residents and community leaders said before Tuesday's 
election that they would vote for Flores because of her overtures to the 
community. Others, still distrustful, said they would vote for Wysocki to let 
Flores know that she still has a long way to go to satisfy them. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' lopsided victory districtwide apparently was built on a strong showing 
in the northern part of the sprawling 15th District, which extends from Watts 
to San Pedro. In Watts, for example, where Wysocki is virtually unknown, Flores 
walloped the Wilmington activist by taking 93% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In San Pedro, where Flores lives, unofficial results showed Flores beating 
Wysocki by 68.4% to 31.6%. Although Wysocki was defeated in San Pedro by more 
than 2 to 1, she said the returns should give Flores cause for concern because 
those totals fall short of her districtwide averages. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial results available Wednesday did not include ballots cast for 
write-in candidate Clifford E. McClain of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and Wysocki never campaigned face to face, and they went about the 
election in very different ways. Flores spent $200,000 on the race, sending 
slick, targeted mailings to residents throughout the district. Wysocki, who 
spent about $6,000, relied on door-to-door campaigning on evenings and weekends 
when she was not teaching school. 
</P>
<P>
The women's differing styles were also evident on Election Night. 
</P>
<P>
Wysocki spent the evening with her mother, watching the election returns on 
television at the house they share on Wilmington's west side. Spread before 
them on a coffee table were the remnants of Wysocki's campaign: a map of the 
15th Council District, a clipboard containing a stack of voter registration 
records and a chart with the names of 110 people Wysocki recruited to help her 
canvass votes. 
</P>
<P>
Wysocki said her campaign workers either telephoned or sent fliers to every 
registered voter in Wilmington and to voters in selected precincts elsewhere in 
the district. She electioneered on her own behalf in her own precinct. "My 
precinct is a mark of honor with me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not My Nature' to Party 
</P>
<P>
Wysocki said she intends to thank each of her campaign workers personally. But 
when her mother, 79-year-old Evelyn Wysocki, suggested that they should have 
thrown a party, the candidate demurred. "It's not my nature," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several miles away in San Pedro, the atmosphere was far more festive at 
Franko's Restaurant, where Flores had invited her staff members and their 
families to join her in an Election Night celebration. About 80 people attended 
the dinner party, which Flores' press deputy described as "intimate." 
</P>
<P>
A huge framed photograph of Flores stood on an easel in the entryway to the 
restaurant, which was festooned with red, white and blue balloons and banners 
that bore Flores' name. After her guests finished eating, Flores entertained 
the crowd by narrating a skit that spoofed two of her top aides. 
</P>
<P>
Flores seemed confident and said she was in a mood to celebrate. Even before 
her staff began announcing the election returns, she thanked them and their 
families. "This evening really is for you," she said. "The success -- when we 
finally announce the success -- will be for you."

SLOW-GROWTH CARRIES DAY IN BURBANK; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION CREATES COUNCIL MAJORITY CAUTIOUS ON DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
With the election of Tim Murphy, the Burbank City Council will be controlled by 
members who favor slowing development, city officials and developers said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the same people disagreed on whether the slow-growth majority will 
establish new city policy on development. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is almost as slow as it can get in terms of growth," said Chuck 
Cusumano, a Burbank developer. "There have been so many restrictions put in 
during the last three years, on parking and on how much you can put on 
property, that there's not a lot more they can do." 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy said more restrictions may be implemented: "Development in Burbank 
will not stop, but it will slow down. We're going to be demanding more in the 
planning of projects. Our priority is going to be protecting residential 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard agreed. "There's a possibility that existing laws 
will be strengthened, not weakened," she said. "There's going to be less 
development, and the projects will be better." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and businessman Tom Flavin will join Howard and Michael R. Hastings on 
the council May 1. Murphy and Hastings were the top vote-getters in Tuesday's 
runoff election, and Flavin was elected in the city's February primary. Howard 
has two years left on her term and was not up for reelection. Neither was 
Robert R. Bowne, who will be the only pro-development member of the five-person 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Al F. Dossin, who said he favored planned growth, was defeated 
Tuesday. Councilwoman Mary E. Kelsey was voted out in February. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been criticized by Flavin and Murphy for favoring developers. 
Murphy said the council approved a number of large developments that threatened 
the sanctity of residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin, Murphy and Hastings supported a planned-growth ordinance, authored by 
Howard, that was approved by voters in February. The ordinance prohibits the 
City Council from allowing developers to build more units on their land than 
allowed under the city's code. The law also prevents the council from making 
changes in the city's master plan that would increase the number of residential 
units in Burbank. Developers opposed the law, saying it placed unfair limits on 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Slowing growth was the dominant issue in the recent campaign. The winners said 
Burbank was becoming increasingly affected by problems brought on by 
development, such as traffic congestion, noise and smog. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Thomas Tunnicliffe predicted the city's rate of development will not 
change with the new council majority. "There's still a lot of building to be 
done in downtown Burbank and in the city's Media District," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tunnicliffe cited the city's efforts to build a shopping center on 41 acres in 
the middle of downtown Burbank and said the project would attract additional 
development. 
</P>
<P>
August Bachetta, a developer and architect, said he thinks fewer development 
projects will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin said it was too early to determine whether the new council will be more 
or less restrictive toward development. "I think all of us on the council 
realize that growth and rejuvenation are important," he said. "But we need to 
do it in a fashion that is compatible with existing residential neighborhoods."

COUNCILWOMAN PRESSES TO OUST 2 FROM CARSON PLANNING PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson City Councilwoman Sylvia Muise, who pushed for the ouster of two 
planning commissioners from a key city panel, said she questions whether Frank 
Gutierrez and Charles Peters, who left the subcommittee this week, should stay 
on the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"If you educate them and they choose not to abide by the law (which gives the 
public the right to address the panel), then I wonder why they should be on the 
Planning Commission," Muise said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, who is chairman of the commission, and Peters have been the focus of 
attacks by North Carson residents and mobile home owners. The North Carson 
residents allege Gutierrez did not permit residents to speak at meetings on a 
proposed development near their neighborhood. Mobile home park residents accuse 
both men of bias toward park owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not biased. I am not rude," Peters said Wednesday. He said he resigned 
for the sake of "peace and harmony" from the seven-member city panel, which is 
to make recommendations on relocation benefits that mobile home park owners 
must pay tenants before shutting a mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
Peters said he has no intention of resigning from the Planning Commission. 
Gutierrez could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
With four mobile home parks announcing plans to close, the issue of relocation 
benefits has regularly drawn hundreds of park residents to council chambers. 
Park owners cite escalating real estate prices as an opportunity for them to 
develop mobile home park sites and the city's mobile home rent control program 
as a drag on profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Define 'Reasonable' 
</P>
<P>
The relocation benefits panel was set up after City Atty. Glenn Watson informed 
the City Council that state law limits park closure benefits imposed by 
municipalities to "reasonable" costs of relocation. Watson said the city must 
define what is "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which consists of three planning commissioners, two mobile home 
residents and two representatives of park owners, is to make recommendations to 
the Planning Commission, which in turn is to report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile home park residents, a potent political force in the city, have been 
pushing for an expansive definition, while park owners are seeking to limit 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the pending closures, the council voted last week to impose a 45-day 
moratorium on park closures so that the panel can complete its work. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, complaints about Gutierrez and Peters came before the 
council. Muise introduced a motion, seconded by Councilman Michael Mitoma, to 
remove the two. It failed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kay Calas said she got in touch with Gutierrez and Peters on her own 
after the meeting and asked them to view council meeting tapes, on which the 
two were denounced. If she had been the target of such an intense dispute, 
Calas said, she would resign. 
</P>
<P>
Muise said Tuesday the resignations of Gutierrez and Peters from the relocation 
benefits panel may be insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
At her prodding, city planning staffers are preparing a report for the council 
on the conduct of the two "because we have received an inordinate amount of 
requests for their removal" from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners Margaret Hudson and Joseph Harlow have replaced 
Gutierrez and Peters on the relocation benefits panel.

R.H. ESTATES REJECTS EXPANSION OF PRIVATE SCHOOL, CANCELS PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Citing opposition from nearby residents, the city of Rolling Hills Estates has 
rejected a request by the Peninsula Heritage School to increase its enrollment 
and add new classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also noted that the school has failed to meet the requirements 
of a previous conditional-use permit and directed the school to apply for a new 
permit to stay in business at Palos Verdes Drive North and Rolling Hills Road. 
</P>
<P>
The council heard the expansion request, which had been approved by the 
Planning Commission in January, on an appeal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Enrollment of 120 
</P>
<P>
The school, which is permitted to have 108 students on campus at any one time, 
has an actual enrollment of 120 students in kindergarten through sixth grade. 
The school had asked to increase the number of students permitted on campus to 
180 and to build five classrooms, replacing three of its existing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
During the four-hour hearing, more than a dozen residents spoke against the 
request, complaining of noise and traffic generated by the school. Some also 
said their property is periodically flooded with water from the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The school, a private, nonprofit institution, received a conditional-use permit 
from the city in 1976, when it was known as the Wingrock School. City officials 
said several conditions of the permit were never met, including a requirement 
to pave the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1976 permit had no expiration date, the city has since passed a 
zoning ordinance limiting the term of conditional-use permits to four years. 
City Atty. Richard Terzian told the council Tuesday that the school is 
technically in violation of the zoning ordinance for operating without a 
current permit. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to overturn the Planning Commission's decision 
and directed the school to apply for a new permit. Councilman Warren 
Schwarzmann said the city will then review the school's ability to comply with 
the original conditions and decide whether to add new conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision came as a relief to many neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mare Annoyed by Children 
</P>
<P>
Two residents brought a basketball and a soccer ball that had been tossed into 
their yards by children playing at the school and they complained that they had 
to retrieve balls from their property several times a week. One neighbor said 
his Arabian mare had been annoyed by schoolchildren. 
</P>

"I don't think it's fair for a school to come in and abuse the privilege of 
being in my back yard," said Glenda Urmacher, another resident. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nell Mirels said the city was partly to blame for the ill will that had 
developed between the school and its neighbors because it failed to pursue 
unmet conditions of the permit. "A lot of things slipped through the cracks," 
she said.

EL SEGUNDO PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 18 years on the job, El Segundo's public works director was abruptly 
fired Monday and told to clean out his desk and hand in his keys to City Hall 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
William Glickman said he was surprised by City Manager Fred Sorsabal's decision 
to fire him and was not told why he was being let go. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't know. I have no inkling," said Glickman, who earned $79,560 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say there haven't been any criticisms or negative comments or 
things suggested like 'Bill, shape up in this area or that area,' " the 
55-year-old Glickman added. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman said that by 5 p.m. Tuesday, he had said goodby to his co-workers and 
filled out his retirement papers. 
</P>
<P>
Sorsabal, who has resigned from his job effective next week to become Mission 
Viejo's city manager, declined to comment on the firing, except to say it was 
carried out in accordance with city personnel regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Those regulations specify that department heads such as Glickman serve at the 
pleasure of the city manager and can be terminated at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman and two other department heads were essentially stripped of some of 
their power about four months ago when Sorsabal created the position of 
development services director. Glickman and the city's planning and building 
and safety directors were instructed to report to the new department head. 
Previously, the three had reported to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Sorsabal said he was creating the new position, which was filled 
by former Planning Director Lynn Harris, to streamline the city's bureaucracy 
and make it more responsive to residents. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Councilman Alan West lashed out at Sorsabal's action, saying it 
was unfair to fire Glickman and not tell him why. Even if Sorsabal had been 
unhappy with Glickman's work, he should have been given an opportunity to 
improve his job performance, West asserted. 
</P>
<P>
West said he was unaware of Sorsabal's plan to fire Glickman. "To treat people 
like that stinks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Clutter said he, too, was unaware that Sorsabal intended to fire 
Glickman. Nevertheless, he defended Sorsabal, saying the city manager is trying 
to make programs work.

CHP BEGINS PROGRAM TO INSPECT TRUCKS PASSING THROUGH MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trucks in the Moorpark area will be subject to inspection at least once a week 
under a program that began Wednesday to reduce the volume of traffic on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Truck traffic through Moorpark has almost doubled in the past five years, from 
an average of 1,800 trips daily in 1983 to 3,500 in 1988, according to a 
Caltrans survey. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the truckers drive through Moorpark to avoid the Conejo Grade 
inspection station on the Ventura Freeway between Thousand Oaks and Camarillo, 
said Sgt. Terry Carroll of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't be able to avoid us as easily now," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
At least once a week at various locations throughout Moorpark, the CHP and the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department will check brakes and other mechanical 
features, and make sure trucks and their drivers are properly registered, 
Carroll said. Violators will be ticketed and, in some cases, detained until the 
necessary repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, officers set up a roadside inspection station on Los Angeles 
Avenue near Gabbert Road. CHP Sgt. Al Bowers said about 300 trucks will be 
inspected Wednesday and Thursday. Each inspection takes about 15 minutes unless 
the vehicle needs extensive repairs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By midday, officers had detained the driver of a moving van for having a rear 
tire with a hole the size of a softball, among other violations. Repairs, 
estimated at about $500, would have to be made before the driver could move on, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Some truckers complained about the delay, though none would admit to using the 
route through Moorpark as a means of avoiding the inspection station on the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark officials are working with Caltrans and the CHP to build a permanent 
truck inspection site on the western outskirts of the city. The station would 
generate revenue for Moorpark and encourage truckers to comply with safety 
standards, said Richard Hare, Moorpark's deputy city manager.

COMPANIES BILKED OF $680,000; 
</P>
<P>
MAN IN CREDIT SCAM GETS 6-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man who bilked scores of companies out of more than $680,000 through 
phony credit orders was sentenced Wednesday to six years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Leonard Balla, who pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud Jan. 9, 
was sentenced by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima. The federal probation 
department had recommended a five-year sentence, but Tashima said he added 12 
months because of Balla's involvement in a highly publicized vice trial in 
London. Balla could have received five years for each count. 
</P>
<P>
In the London case, Balla, 24, was accused of running a sophisticated call-girl 
ring that employed more than 200 prostitutes in the ritzy Mayfair district. 
Balla was arrested in London on Sept. 28, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
British authorities dropped the charges against Balla and four other defendants 
June 8 amid allegations, extensively reported in the tabloid press there, that 
one of the ring's prostitutes was romantically involved with a veteran Scotland 
Yard detective. British prosecutors apparently believed that the publicity had 
compromised their case, Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's hearing, Katz cited declarations by women who had said Balla 
had hired them as prostitutes in England. The declarations were provided by 
British prosecutors. Tashima said they show that Balla's British escort 
service, Brookwise Ltd., was really a front for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bust-Out' Scheme 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. charges against Balla stem from his involvement in a "bust-out" scheme 
that he operated in Oxnard and Canoga Park, Katz said. Balla used the good 
credit rating of Knolls Vacuum &amp; Sewing, a Long Beach store he purchased in 
1984, to order more than $1 million in food, clothing, exercise equipment and 
electronic goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Balla set up a phony storefront in Oxnard to receive the merchandise, later 
resold through two warehouses in Canoga Park, Katz said. Balla was indicted in 
the scheme June 4, 1986, but prosecutors believe that he was already in England 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
He was extradited from London to Los Angeles on Nov. 22, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement with prosecutors, Balla admitted defrauding five companies. But 
Katz said authorities believe that 209 companies across the country lost 
$686,786 in the scheme. Another 61 companies lost unknown amounts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima ordered Balla to make restitution to the victims, but Katz said Balla 
has no money. "Unless Balla wins the Big Spin, how's he going to pay it?" he 
asked.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CALTRANS OPPOSES SOUND WALL AT FREEWAY 
TRUCK-ACCIDENT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sound wall is not justified near where a truck careened off the Hollywood 
Freeway in January, based on sound readings taken Wednesday by the state 
Department of Transportation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans had agreed to monitor traffic noise across Babcock Avenue from the 
freeway, where houses were built before the freeway opened in 1968. They found 
sound levels there between 61 and 63 decibels, below the established 67-decibel 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Noise levels on the freeway side of Babcock Avenue were 76 decibels, in excess 
of the limit, but the houses there were built after 1968. According to state 
regulations, Caltrans is only responsible for reducing sound for houses that 
predate freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Caltrans agreed to install a guardrail along the freeway to 
help prevent future off-road accidents. But neighbors believe that a sound wall 
would offer more protection, both from vehicles and noise. 
</P>
<P>
The state maintains that a wall is the city's responsibility because city 
officials allowed the houses to be built next to the freeway. The city 
maintains that all sound walls are the state's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like we're in a limbo here," said Bob Brice, who lives on Babcock 
Avenue and has led the sound-wall fight. "It's a big mess."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An electrical fire erupted in a Sepulveda transmission repair shop early 
Wednesday, causing $130,000 in damage to the structure and its contents, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 3:40 a.m. at Steve's Automatic Transmission Service in 
the 9000 block of Sepulveda Boulevard, said Jim Wells, Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
It took 45 firefighters about 30 minutes to extinguish the blaze, Wells said. 
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Six cars stored in the repair shop were partially damaged by the fire, which 
Wells said was caused by an electrical short inside the building.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council has banned the sale of used cars along a 
six-mile stretch of Thousand Oaks Boulevard because a study showed that the 
activity posed a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Tuesday to prohibit owners from displaying their 
cars for sale on Thousand Oaks Boulevard between Lakeview Canyon and Moorpark 
roads. About 90 cars were parked along the thoroughfare each weekend, causing 
drivers to double-park and slowing traffic, said Jano Baghdanian, the city's 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved an ordinance that gives the city the authority to ban 
car sales on other streets if a study shows there are safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
The council is studying a proposal to allow public use of a city parking lot to 
sell cars on weekends.

AFTER ANOTHER LOSS TO GIANTS, DODGERS FINALLY HEAD HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the calendar, it's still mid-April, but after Wednesday's 3-1 loss 
here to the Giants, the Dodgers could hardly be blamed for wondering which 
would come first: their home opener or the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Even before setting a foot in Dodger Stadium, which they will finally do this 
afternoon against the Houston Astros, the Dodgers have gotten a first-hand look 
at the principals involved in baseball's two biggest scandals of the year: Pete 
Rose in Cincinnati, of course, and Ed Jurak in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Who's Ed Jurak? The Giant reserve who is best known as the guy who introduced 
Margo Adams to Wade Boggs, according to Penthouse magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Nancy Reagan toes the rubber today and makes her first pitch of 
1989, Orel Hershiser has allowed seven runs, Eddie Murray has hit one grand 
slam, Kirk Gibson has played with pain, and Mike Davis has been called out on 
strikes for stepping out of the batter's box in the mistaken belief that the 
plate umpire had called time. 
</P>
<P>
And even before today's pregame ceremony in which they will receive diamond 
rings for winning the World Series, the Dodgers have played in home openers for 
three other teams, sat through one rainout, and lost five games, which is two 
more than they have won. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those losses belong to Fernando Valenzuela, whose second start on the 
comeback road was short-circuited in the first inning Wednesday by the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
With two runners on base, Kevin Mitchell drove a 3-and-0 fastball from 
Valenzuela over the left-field fence to give the Giants all the runs they 
needed to win the rubber game of this three-game set with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Butler opened the game with a drag-bunt single, Robby Thompson followed 
with a line-drive basehit and, after Valenzuela struck out Will Clark, Mitchell 
connected for his third home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
When the next batter, Candy Maldonado, followed with another sharp hit, it 
appeared that Valenzuela might not get out of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
But he retired the next two batters and managed to last almost four more 
innings, escaping trouble in the third with the help of first baseman Eddie 
Murray, who ranged far to his right to make a backhand grab of Maldonado's 
ground ball, then force the runner at second. In the fifth, Valenzuela was 
lifted after Clark's two-out single, the sixth hit he'd given up. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger offense, however, was as little help to Valenzuela Wednesday as it 
had been in his first start Friday in Atlanta, when the Dodgers managed one run 
off Braves' starter Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Dodgers' only run came in the first inning on singles by Willie 
Randolph and Mike Marshall, with Marshall getting a chance to drive the run in 
only after Giant first baseman Clark and second baseman Robby Thompson got 
their signals crossed on Marshall's foul popup on the previous pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Giant starter Scott Garrelts and three relievers combined to limit the Dodgers 
to five hits, all singles. Rookie Jeff Brantley, who played college ball at 
Mississippi State with Clark, entered the game in the sixth after Garrelts 
walked Gibson and Murray with no outs to face Marshall, who had singled in both 
of his previous at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall hit a sharp ground ball to Jurak, who stepped on third to retire 
Gibson, then threw to second to force Murray. Brantley struck out John Shelby 
to end the inning. Atlee Hammaker left two Dodgers on base in the seventh when 
he retired Alfredo Griffin on a fly ball, and the Dodgers never had another 
base-runner. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda lamented the death of Sugar Ray Robinson, whom he described as a 
longtime friend. "He loved the Dodgers," Lasorda said. "Pound-for-pound, he was 
the greatest fighter who ever lived." Joe Morgan, the ex-second baseman, was in 
Lasorda's office at the time. "Pound-for-pound, he was one of the greatest 
baseball players I ever saw," Lasorda said of Morgan. Replied Morgan, now a 
Giant broadcaster: "Unfortunately, they don't rate them by the pound." . . . 
Vin Scully, the Dodger broadcaster, recalled seeing Robinson fight Joey Maxim 
in Yankee Stadium, a fight that Robinson appeared to be winning until he became 
ill in the ring. "I just remember the heat," Scully said. "It was 
overpowering." . . . Craig Lefferts, the Giant reliever who saved Tuesday's 8-3 
win, is 7-0 against the Dodgers in his six-year career, spent with the Padres 
and Giants. . . . Ed Jurak, who started at third base for the Giants in place 
of Matt Williams (1 for 23), is in his 15th season of pro ball but has played 
just 163 games in the major leagues, all with Boston, singled off Tim Crews' 
bare hand in the sixth and was given the ball for his first National League 
hit.

BRAVES JUMP ON RASMUSSEN TO KNOCK PADRES OFF TOP, 5-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER

<P>
First things first. The Padres' first-place standing met starting pitcher 
Dennis Rasmussen's first-inning blues Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
And this morning the Padres are in second place, thanks to a 5-0 loss to 
Atlanta before 14,621 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The continued first inning troubles of Rasmussen started the decline, and the 
inability of the Padres to figure out left-hander Tom Glavine, who handed the 
Padres their first shutout since last Aug. 30, sealed it. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen and first innings get along about as well as Bryant Gumbel and The 
Today Show cast. Last year, Rasmussen allowed 20 first-inning runs in 31 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
He has picked up this year where he left off last. 
</P>
<P>
Ever consistent, he spotted Houston a first inning run Friday in his first 
outing of 1989. The first three Astros to face Rasmussen reached base -- a 
double, single and bunt single. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the Braves took it a step further when their first four batters 
reached base. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to the park today, I got behind three or four cars that were slowing 
because of a fire truck and paramedics, so I took a detour," Padre Manager Jack 
McKeon said. "That's basically what Rasmussen did." 
</P>
<P>
The detour started in the first, when Rasmussen stepped onto the mound, toed 
the rubber and the hits began to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Smith started things with a single to right. Next came Dale Murphy, 
wearing some extra incentive having been moved up to second in the batting 
order for only the second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The move worked. Murphy drove Rasmussen's first offering over the inside wall 
in center field, 405-feet away. The home run was No. 335 for Murphy, tying Hank 
Aaron's Atlanta club record. 
</P>
<P>
How bad have things been for Murphy? A reporter asked him after the game when 
he last batted second, and Murphy misunderstood. Never impolite, Murphy 
acknowledged he hasn't been on base much this year, but pointed out that he had 
reached second base just last night. 
</P>
<P>
Once the question was made clear, he recalled batting second sometime around 
1980, when Bobby Cox, the current Brave general manager, was the Brave manager. 
</P>
<P>
After Murphy crossed the plate, Rasmussen was in a familiar setting. The 
opposition was on the scoreboard and the first inning was still young. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to get younger. Gerald Perry followed Murphy's blast with a single to 
left and clean-up hitter Andres Thomas, who had one of just three home runs in 
Atlanta's batting order, bounced a ball into the hole between short and third. 
Garry Templeton smothered it, but couldn't do anything. Perry was safe at 
second and Thomas was standing on first. And none were out. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen worked the fifth batter, Jody Davis, to a full count before finally 
inducing him to fly to right. Then, a couple of arms -- Rasmussen's and catcher 
Benito Santiago's -- prevented further damage. 
</P>
<P>
As Rasmussen struck out Ron Gant, Thomas attempted to steal second and Santiago 
threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen labored through the next three innings, but got away unscathed. One 
Brave reached base against him in the second, two more in the third, none in 
the fourth and three in the fifth. Murphy, who had walked, scored in the fifth 
on Thomas' single to center. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the fifth inning, Rasmussen's last, he was shaken for three runs 
and eight hits. He walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine (2-0), meanwhile, simply overmatched the Padres. By game's end, Glavine 
had thrown his first career shutout, allowing just six hits and walking just 
one. 
</P>
<P>
He was 7-17 last year, but his earned run average for this season, including a 
win over the Dodgers last week, is 0.00. 
</P>
<P>
"Glavine did a great job," Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon said. "That's two in a 
row for him against supposedly the two best teams in the division." 
</P>
<P>
Said Glavine: "I think it's a matter of going out there more aggressive and not 
being afraid to throw strikes. Last year, I was hoping I could make the pitches 
and get guys out. This year, I decided if they're going to hit me, they're 
going to do it doing what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Glavine used a fastball, slider, curve and change-up to keep the Padres 
guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"He was good," Garry Templeton said. "He pitched a hell of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Clark: "He was super. We never got anything going. Carmelo (Martinez) 
and Randy (Ready) had some good cuts, but other than that, he got everyone in 
the order out easily." 
</P>
<P>
Ready and Martinez each had two hits. Clark was frustrated again, going zero 
for four and reaching for strike three on his final time at bat in the ninth. 
His batting average dropped to .148. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Martinez and Ready, the only other Padre hits were by Tony Gwynn and 
Benito Santiago. Gwynn, who now has hit safely in all nine games, got his hit 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the game was decided. When the Braves scored their fourth run, it 
was apparent that breaks were falling everywhere but in the Padres' direction. 
Greg Booker replaced Rasmussen in the sixth and promptly walked his first 
batter, Ron Gant. John Russell followed with a single, moving Gant to second 
and then Jeff Blauser bunted them up a base. 
</P>
<P>
The infield pulled in, and the Padres got exactly what they wanted -- a ground 
ball. Then they got what they didn't want -- an error. Glavine grounded a shot 
to Roberto Alomar, but the ball cut through the infield grass and skipped past 
Alomar and into right field for Alomar's fifth error in nine games. Gant scored 
and it was 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Alomar was suffering from a swollen left arm as well as a 
bruised ego. He was spiked early on by Thomas, but not severely enough to take 
an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about it," Alomar said of his fifth error. "It just happened. I 
can't be concerned about it. You just try to do the best you can." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres put their leadoff man on in the fifth, seventh and ninth but failed 
to produce a run. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Greg Harris played long toss in the outfield Wednesday and then 
pronounced himself fit to pitch. "I feel a lot better today," Harris said. 
"I've made a lot of progress since yesterday." According to Harris, the injury 
was never officially diagnosed. "I think it was a small torn cartilage under 
the ribs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery was also feeling better Wednesday after taking himself out of 
Tuesday's lineup because of a bout with the flu. "First time ever," Flannery 
said of his decision to remove himself from the order. "I've played with torn 
ligaments and broken ribs, but I couldn't see straight yesterday. I thought I 
was going to get pulled over for drunk driving on the way to the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Rawls sang the national anthem before Wednesday's game. Rawls, in town to 
promote the United Negro College Fund, shagged some balls and took some swings 
during batting practice after John Kruk spied him on the field and handed him a 
glove. Good thing Rawls, a baseball fan, sings better than he plays. He took a 
fly ball in the face during batting practice but was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching rotations are set for this weekend's series with Cincinnati, the 
first series that can be called important since the Padres fell out of the 1985 
race in mid-season. On Friday, Danny Jackson (1-1) will face Eric Show (1-1). 
Saturday, Tom Browning (2-0) goes against Bruce Hurst (1-1). Sunday, Rick 
Mahler (0-2) takes the mound against Ed Whitson (2-0). The match ups are 
attractive because, among other things, a couple of hard-throwers -- Jackson 
and Show -- are pitted against each other, as are a couple of crafty left 
handers (Browning and Hurst). "I really don't think much about the match-ups," 
Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson said. "The only thing you really want to avoid 
is getting blown out three days in a row. You just want to play well and be 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
A 162-game season is full of little tests, and one began Wednesday night for 
the Padres. Starting with Tom Glavine, Atlanta's pitcher, the Padres face four 
left handers in four days. Look for Randy Ready to get plenty of playing time. 
Last season, the Padres batted .247 against lefties, the same average as 
against right handers.

NEWBURY PARK LETS GOOD TIMES ROLL IN 9-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sure, the Newbury Park High baseball team is having a good ol' time. And why 
not? 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers are unbeaten in their last 14 games. They have won all five of 
their Marmonte League games. And everybody seems to be getting in on the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wonder that they are not aggravating their opponents. Nothing worse 
than a bunch of guys having a good time as they dismantle you. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out here to have fun," pitcher Tim Beal said after Newbury Park defeated 
Thousand Oaks, 9-2, in a league game Wednesday at Thousand Oaks. "At least 
that's the way I see it. We just can't lose that. We can't get too confident." 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's success has driven Coach Gary Fabricius to quote Oklahoma 
basketball Coach Billy Tubbs, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember what Billy Tubbs said when Oklahoma was ranked first in the nation 
this year?" said Fabricius, who supplied his own answer. " 'It's great.' That's 
what he said. Not many teams have a chance to be here. And Newbury Park hasn't 
been on top in a while." 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be the Panthers' turn now, however. They are accomplishing it with 
durable pitching, clutch hitting and with flair on the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
Take this game, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Beal improved to 4-0 and completed his seventh game in eight starts. He 
scattered eight hits, allowing only two after the third inning. He struck out 
10, including the side in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the Panthers needed only six hits to score nine times. In the first 
inning, Eric Greene scored easily from third base on a wild pitch. The pitch 
from Thousand Oaks starter John Bushart bounced in front of the plate, hit 
catcher Jud Schlimgen in the chest and ricocheted in front of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Greene scored on another Bushart wild pitch. Greene and Brad 
Cleveringa each scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 5-2, Newbury Park (14-1-3 overall, 5-0 in league play) buried the 
Lancers (8-6, 3-2) with four runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveringa drew a lead-off walk and Greene, who was three for three, singled. 
Geoff Black then doubled to score two runs and Danny Madsen followed with his 
fourth home run, a two-run blast to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, which stranded nine baserunners, managed a run-scoring single by 
Bill Hall in the first and an RBI fielder's choice by Brian Higgins in the 
second. Hall was four for four. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked at the beginning of the year about doing whatever it takes to win," 
Fabricius said. "And they're doing what it takes right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to explain it, but I like it." 
</P>
<P>
Just having a little fun. 
</P>

NOTRE DAME STARTS FAST TO FINISH HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The temperature is not all that has cooled since last weekend. Less than a week 
after upsetting highly-rated Arcadia, Harvard High was cold cocked by Notre 
Dame in a San Fernando Valley League baseball game Wednesday at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights scored six runs in the first three innings on their way to an 8-2 
victory in the league opener for both teams. Notre Dame (14-1 overall) had six 
hits, including two doubles, in the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a heck of an offensive lineup," Harvard Coach Jim Brink said of 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Said Notre Dame outfielder Chris Lohman, who has a team-high 22 runs batted in: 
"We have a great hitting lineup. We'll get the hits, there's no doubt about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights wasted no time Wednesday. Kevin Crosby doubled to the left-field 
gap on the first pitch and came around to score on Lohman's sacrifice fly two 
batters later. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hughes followed with a walk, then scored on Kevin Milligan's double. 
</P>
<P>
"We started the game well," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville said. "Crosby set 
the tone for our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Crosby also started the Knights' four-run third inning with a walk. Chad 
Ratliff singled, Crosby and Ratliff each stole a base and Lohman singled both 
runners home. 
</P>
<P>
A sacrifice fly and an error accounted for Notre Dame's two other runs in the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Lohman also knocked in the Knights' final run in the sixth inning, giving the 
senior outfielder two hits, two walks and four RBIs for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a clutch hitter," Mandeville said of Lohman. "When he's going good, it's 
hard to find a guy with a better stroke than his." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame pitcher Cary Wichmann shut down the Saracens to benefit from the 
offensive support. The sophomore right-hander struck out four of the first six 
batters he faced and allowed only four hits and one run in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was overpowering us for a little while," Brink said of Wichmann. "We've 
seen some good pitching, but day in and day out, we don't see that kind of 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-0, Harvard (6-9) scored a run in the fourth inning on a double by 
Robby Thayer and an RBI single by Marty Holly. But Wichmann struck out two 
batters to get out of the inning.

TAGLIAFERRI SIGNS TO PLAY BASEBALL FOR FRESNO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gino Tagliaferri, a two-time Times' All-Valley shortstop from Kennedy High, 
signed a letter of intent Wednesday to play baseball at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri said he selected Fresno State over Arizona State and Oklahoma State 
because of the location and the opportunity to play as a freshman. Fresno State 
shortstop Ed Zosky, a junior, is a projected first-round pick in the June 
amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Oklahoma and didn't like the weather too much and it was a little 
too far from home," Tagliaferri said. "I liked Arizona State, but they started 
talking about how if you didn't perform you could lose your scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresno is a little closer to home . . . What really turned me on was the 
stadium and they get really good fan support. My friend, (USC shortstop) Kevin 
Farlow, said when they played there it was the greatest thing. I went there to 
see for myself and I fell in love with it." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri is batting .340 with five home runs and 18 runs batted in for 
Kennedy (13-4). He is the second Valley-area player to commit to Fresno State. 
Tim Costic of Monroe has also committed to play for the Bulldogs, ranked 12th 
in the latest Collegiate Baseball magazine poll. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame catcher Bobby Hughes signed with Loyola Marymount and Camarillo 
pitcher Steve Biggs signed with California on Wednesday. Other Valley-area 
players who committed to colleges are Alemany catcher Mike Sims (Cal State 
Northridge); St. Francis catcher Gregg Zaun (Texas); and Westlake catcher Derek 
Tamburro (UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is batting .459 with 20 RBIs for Notre Dame (141), ranked second in the 
Times' Valley poll. Sims is batting .306 with four extra-base hits and 13 RBIs 
for Alemany (10-8), which leads the Del Rey League with a 4-1 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Biggs is 4-1 with a 2.80 earned-run average and 43 strikeouts in 35 innings 
pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Tamburro, whose father Don is an assistant at UCLA, is batting .317. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Kane, a sophomore left-hander at Valley College, said he will sign a 
letter of intent with Cal State Long Beach. Kane said he considered USC and 
Loyola, but selected Long Beach so he could play for Coach Dave Snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a broadcasting major and they have a real good program at Long Beach," 
said Kane, who is 6-3 with a 2.20 ERA. "It's a chance to pitch and play for a 
great coach."

CSUN UPSETS FRESNO ST. ON VIGO'S HOME RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman third baseman Denny Vigo hit a two-run home run in the top of the 
ninth inning to lead Cal State Northridge to a 4-2 nonconference victory over 
host Fresno State on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge improved to 19-11-1. Fresno State, ranked 12th in Division I by 
Collegiate Baseball magazine, is 27-13. 
</P>
<P>
Senior left-hander Fili Martinez (4-3) pitched his third consecutive complete 
game, allowing six hits and striking out eight. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State took a 2-1 lead in the sixth on Steve Vondran's two-out single 
that scored Tom Goodwin, who extended his hitting streak to 28 games with a 
bunt single. 
</P>
<P>
Chae-Ho Chong led off the sixth with his eighth home run of the season to make 
the score, 2-2, setting the stage for Vigo's home run off Fresno State bullpen 
ace Bobby Jones that drove in Rusty McLain.

</P>
<P>
Chaminade (5-10 overall) tied the score, 3-3, in the fifth inning when Pete

DIGEST: CS NORTHRIDGE SIGNS FOUR SOFTBALL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge softball team is using Crescenta Valley High the way a 
major league baseball team takes advantage of a its minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors, who already have five former Crescenta Valley players on 
their roster, will add another next season. 
</P>
<P>
Gina Moe, a two-year starter at second base for the Falcons, has orally 
commited to play softball for Northridge. She said Wednesday that she will sign 
a letter of intent as soon as it arrives in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Also committing to CSUN was Lisa Ferraconi, a catcher from Palomar College; 
Danielle Wood, a first baseman from Hart High; and Lisa Huffaker, a shortstop 
from El Camino Real High who has been a starter on two City Section 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Cal State Northridge signed three basketball recruits -- all from 
Northern California -- to letters of intent Wednesday. Signing were Al Jackson, 
a 6-1 guard from West Valley College, Shanan Rosenberg, a 6-8 forward from St. 
Francis High and Percy Fisher, a 6-7 forward from San Francisco Riordan High. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson averaged 11 points and 5.5 assists for West Valley in 1988. He 
redshirted last season. Rosenberg averaged 16 points and 12 rebounds and Fisher 
eight points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Men's Senior Baseball League of Los Angeles and Ventura counties opens play 
this weekend with a doubleheader at Bluebird Field in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The four-team league for players 30-and-over includes a 15-game schedule and a 
double-elimination tournament in September. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Gran, a former Cal Lutheran offensive coordinator and wide receiver coach, 
has been hired as a graduate assistant football coach at Southeast Missouri 
State in Cape Girardeau, Mo. Gran played for Cal Lutheran before becoming wide 
receiver coach in 1987 and offensive coordinator last season.

DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: BALL GUESTS BARK UP THE RIGHT TREE

<P>
Not all of the 1,500 guests at Friday's third annual Fur Ball swallowed 
goldfish, but most freely admitted that the local social scene, at least for 
that night, was going straight to the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The goldfish, lest anyone get terribly excited, were the cheese-flavored 
cracker variety, since goldfish munching of the type featured in "A Fish Called 
Wanda" would have been out of place at a benefit for the San Diego Humane 
Society. The thrust of the gala was to encourage guests to cast votes -- in the 
form of cash contributions -- for any of the dozen or so "celebrity" dogs that 
vied for the "Acatemy Awards." 
</P>
<P>
The Fur Ball Committee (an independent humane society support group) plastered 
the lobby and ballroom floors of the U.S. Grant hotel with mock movie posters 
celebrating such non-films as "Gone with the Dogs" and "Hello, Doggy." The 
group also roped the reception area with red fire hydrants and some members 
wore dog biscuits as earrings. Magician and former mayoral candidate Loch David 
Crane, decked out in floppy ears and tail, performed somewhat amazing acts of 
prestidigitation. 
</P>
<P>
Guests were invited to have their photos taken with such hot-dogging pooches as 
Alex, the official spokesdog for Stroh's beer, and Pearl, a circumspect Shih 
Tzu who was accompanied by her companion and master, actor Martin Milner. Alex 
later presided over the competition in which Pearl and other party animals were 
presented to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The event did have a serious side, earning more than $30,000 for the San Diego 
Humane Society. Mimi Groom, director of the society's foundation, said that 
part of the proceeds might be used to purchase a van to carry animals for 
visits with abused children. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new program called 'Bless the Beasts and the Children,' in which we 
will be taking abused animals to abused children," said Groom. "Animals are 
good therapy, and there will be a lot of sharing and love flowing through this 
program." 
</P>
<P>
In the ballroom, masters of ceremonies Denise Yamada and Art Good joined Alex 
at the podium; Yamada and Good opened the proceedings with the aid of cue 
cards, but Alex, putting his best paw forward, ad-libbed. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd displayed an almost surprising enthusiasm for the parade of pets and 
masters that traversed the stage, especially when B-100 disc jockey Ellen 
Thomas, who weighs 80 pounds, was dragged quickly on and off by Bonzo, her 
200-pound Newfoundland retriever. Other notable owners and pets were San Diego 
Councilwoman Lucy Killea and Lady Airwolf, a black Labrador; Domino, the 
Dalmatian mascot of the Del Mar Fire Department, and plastic surgeon Dennis 
Nigro's massive Irish wolfhounds, Guido and Scarface. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Guido and Scarface captured the award in the political category 
(beating out not only Killea's canine, but the white Lhaso Apso brought by 
Councilman Ron Roberts); the mascot category was taken by the Humane Society's 
own Scottish terrier, Sandi, and Bonzo, perhaps more through force of bulk than 
personality, carried the celebrity category. 
</P>
<P>
LA JOLLA -- A fresh breeze would have been just the ticket Thursday, a dog-day 
afternoon if there ever was one, a day on which the thermometer percolated near 
100 degrees, and even this seaside neighborhood seemed ready to melt. 
</P>
<P>
So where was John McEnroe when he was most needed? 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe and his fellow contestants in the weekend's quarterfinal Davis Cup 
competition between the United States and France were invited to a reception at 
the home of Virginia and Jack Monday. The players -- besides McEnroe, the 
American team included Andre Agassi, Ken Flach and Robert Seguso -- were 
obliged to attend a team dinner instead, but Davis Cup chairman Gordon 
Jorgenson and U.S. Tennis Assn. president David Markin turned out to greet a 
houseful of admiring, tennis-crazed locals. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgenson, a longtime friend of the Mondays (both he and his hosts own 
adjoining homes in Palm Springs), seemed cucumber-cool despite the heat when 
the conversation turned to the American team's prospects in the weekend 
matches. "The United States will do very well," he predicted," and it did 
better than that, sweeping France 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Most guests held tickets for the three-day event and talk revolved around 
backhands and forehands. One man whose animated discussion of the courts never 
flagged was Philippe Chatrier, president of both the French Tennis Federation 
and the International Tennis Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Host Monday greeted his guests wearing a new and very prized possession, an 
official Davis Cup tie. "Now I've joined the fraternity," said Monday proudly. 
"Not too many guys have one of these." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included at least two men who are expected to have considerable 
influence in the San Diego sporting scene. Superagent Jeremy Kapstein attended 
with his wife, Linda, and entrepreneur Harry Cooper, who hopes to build a new 
sports palace in downtown San Diego or Sorrento Hills, escorted Valerie Preiss. 
</P>
<P>
Vangie and Dick Burt also attended. In the mid-1960s, Vangie Burt was 
Jorgenson's regular tennis partner when she worked as social director at the 
Biltmore resort in Phoenix. "We won a few tournaments together," said Burt. 
"Gordon was a partner who concentrated -- nothing could distract him."

LOOKING FOR MISS RIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD LOOKS AND BATON TWIRLING ARE NOT ENOUGH TO CAPTURE THE TIARA IN TODAY'S 
BEAUTY PAGEANTS 
</P>

<P>
Anna Marie Dalmatin hugged last year's champion, cradled a dozen red roses, 
adjusted her rhinestone tiara and began the traditional winner's walk. 
</P>
<P>
There she went, the new Miss Northridge, down the long, narrow runway at the 
Odyssey Restaurant in Granada Hills. It was the first formal duty of a one-year 
reign that will include ribbon cuttings, charity functions and civic 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when I'll climb down from my cloud," said Dalmatin, 18, shortly 
after winning the pageant Sunday afternoon. "I didn't think I did that well." 
</P>
<P>
The judges did. They liked her speech, her poise, her swimsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"My eye goes right to her," said Marjorie Goodson Cutt, the hostess on "Classic 
Concentration," a television game show. "She didn't try to be the seductress. 
She's wholesome, not a Barbie doll." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin, pageant veterans say, is typical of today's beauty contestant: 
attractive, ambitious, articulate. She studies history at College of the 
Canyons in Valencia and dreams of working to improve the environment. Indeed, 
many pageants have evolved from mere demonstrations of natural physical beauty 
to comprehensive evaluations of a woman's poise, maturity, and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Beck, who has worked on dozens of San Fernando Valley pageants, including 
Miss Northridge, for several decades, says women use the contest today as a 
vehicle for career advancement, even in such professions as business and law. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding a more intellectual girl, a girl more interested in a college 
education, in the future," said Beck. "Not the Valley girl, bubbly type." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Miss Northridge was crowned, the contestants and crowds departed. 
Someone took down the decorations and special lights. Another beauty pageant 
had begun its fade into memory. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. There will be more pageants next week, and the following week, and 
the week after that. The United States, a land obsessed with looks and grounded 
in ritual, has long counted the beauty contest among its favorite pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carl Dunn, publisher of the Louisiana-based Pageantry Magazine, 
there were over 12,000 contests nationwide last year, with about 3 million 
participants, and that figure doesn't even include independent competitions or 
Junior Miss and baby events. 
</P>
<P>
"Pageants are getting more popular all the time," Dunn said. "And that's 
because of television. Television is the name of the game. There's so much 
money involved these days. Winners can make thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The winners of the state events such as Miss California and Miss Texas can make 
anywhere from $60,000 to $90,000 in prizes and scholarships. Miss America can 
earn $350,000 to $450,000 during her yearlong reign. Nationwide, over $15 
million in scholarships is awarded to beauty pageant winners each year. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Valley chambers of commerce sponsor contests -- Granada Hills, 
Tarzana, Sylmar, Tujunga and Northridge among them. Local businesses, such as 
florists, jewelry stores and cosmetic supply outlets, donate merchandise to the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
While the sponsors emphasize the way pageants help to promote a woman's future 
career and build her self-esteem, they acknowledge that contests promote their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Over her bathing suit, evening gown and business attire, each Miss Northridge 
contestant wore her sponsor's name and gave a speech urging the audience to 
look further into the company. 
</P>
<P>
The companies paid $195 to be a sponsor, and many consider the fee to be well 
worth the publicity. Bob Giacobbe, president of Premier Bank in Northridge, 
which sponsored Dalmatin, said: "There's another year of Premier Bank's name 
being out there." 
</P>
<P>
And Premier Bank -- like all other sponsors -- wants an articulate, poised 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Welsh, a writer for Faces International Magazine who has judged dozens 
of pageants, said beauty is no longer enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I always make it a point to ask girls what they think the woman of the '80s 
has meant, and what the woman of the '90s will mean," Welsh said. "A good 
answer to that question is worth a lot of points. And I don't look to see 
whether a girl has a great figure. I look to see if she is physically fit, if 
she knows how to take care of herself." 
</P>
<P>
Some Valley pageants have eliminated the swimsuit competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We see very few occasions where we would need the winners representing us in a 
bathing suit," said Jo Ann Ainsworth, manager of the Sylmar Chamber of 
Commerce. "We are a business organization, and there was no reason to parade 
bathing beauties." 
</P>
<P>
In San Fernando, contestants are required to undertake a community service 
project and write an essay about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
In Chatsworth, Chamber of Commerce members have been adamantly opposed to 
pageants for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We never have had a pageant, and we never will," said Debra Sakacs, the 
chamber manager. "This is a very non-sexist organization, and we don't think a 
young woman should be judged by her looks." 
</P>
<P>
In Sylmar, the chamber sponsors a Mr. Ambassador contest in addition to a Miss 
Sylmar contest, although officials expect only about five contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the sexist stuff about pageants has receded in the Valley," said David 
Miller, president of the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce. "It was strong a 
few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Miss Northridge pageant drew 25 contestants and about 320 observers. 
All contestants had to be between 17 and 24 
</P>
<P>
years old, single, without children and a resident of the San Fernando Valley 
for at least six months. Resumes could not include professional modeling or 
acting experience. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the contestants were between 17 and 20, and their reasons for entering 
ranged from fulfilling girlhood dreams of glory to enhancing communication 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Lisa Horn, 18, a senior at Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, 
used to watch beauty pageants on television. She and her mother would write 
down their evaluations and predict the winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be just like Miss America," Horn said during rehearsals. "It's 
inspiring because she's done so much, because she can be so responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Horn's dream faded during her one-minute speech to the audience. After her 
opening statement, Horn stumbled and lost her place. Backstage, after her 
performance, she sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had memorized it so well," Horn said, "but when my boyfriend waved to me, I 
froze." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the other contestants moved in to reassure her. Deborah Stern, last 
year's Miss Northridge, who helped the women through all the rehearsals, told 
Horn to concentrate on the rest of the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
For other contestants, like Eileen Leiner, the dream was not about winning. It 
was about competing in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I am real insecure," said Leiner, 22, during a rehearsal. 
"You have no idea about how hard it is for me to go through this. I feel like 
I'm chubby. Getting in front of all those people in a bathing suit scares me. 
But I already feel better about myself. I've worn conservative clothing, and 
now I just want to go wild." 
</P>
<P>
Leiner, a teacher's aide, didn't finish in the final 10, but that didn't seem 
to matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I belong here," she said on Sunday. "I learned how to walk, and I learned how 
to respect myself." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Wagman said she entered the Miss Northridge contest to further 
develop her speaking skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to show people all I've got without being nervous," Wagman said. "Maybe 
I'm not so good in my bathing suit or evening gown, but instead of wearing a 
hot bathing suit, I want to give a good speech." 
</P>
<P>
(The judges thought Wagman gave a great speech -- which contributed to her 
finish as first runner-up.) 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wagman was concerned about her appearance. During a rehearsal she 
said she was worried that her black evening dress would look "too trashy." 
</P>
<P>
And looks were stressed throughout the contest. During the bathing suit 
competition, the master of ceremonies read the contestant's measurements. At 
rehearsals, pageant instructors repeatedly emphasized the importance of the 
right color of bathing suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't wear black," Deborah Stern told the contestants. "It will make you look 
pale. You want to look hot." 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Ann Frashure, who finished as the first runner-up in Miss Northridge 
1988, spent a whole day at the mall looking for the right bathing suit. She 
finally settled on something in purple. 
</P>
<P>
"When you try on a certain bathing suit and look at it in the mirror, you know 
if it's the right one," Frashure said. "I spent $54 on it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she wasn't looking forward to parading the suit in front of 
hundreds of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"There you are in front of 500 people and your back is to the audience," she 
said. "That's all they're looking at. I don't think a beauty pageant as a whole 
is degrading, but I think that part is degrading." 
</P>
<P>
Many women want to win so badly they come back year after year. And intensity 
can breed controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's Miss California pageant, the winner was Miss San Fernando 
Valley. But there is no Miss San Fernando Valley contest. The state winner, 
Christina Faust of Woodland Hills, simply lined up a sponsor and entered -- 
which is within the rules. Some contestants who had participated in community 
contests said her participation was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Valley Chamber of Commerce manager, "It's just not right. But what are 
you going to do? It's all about money, and if you've got it, you can compete 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
At-large contestants enter beauty pageants all the time, said Richard Guy, 
co-owner of Guyrex, a company that runs the Miss California pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"And often, they win," Guy said. "That's because they usually have the 
dedication to do it all themselves, which makes for better businesswomen. It 
would be unfair to not allow a girl to compete just because there wasn't a 
pageant in her town, or that she didn't win it." 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's Miss Northridge pageant, a handful of women claimed the contest was 
rigged in favor of Dalmatin. 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin and chamber officials denied the accusation. "Anytime you have 
something like this somebody says it was fixed," said Sandra Dack, executive 
director of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce. "But these judges were 
television personalities. They didn't know any of the girls or anybody on the 
chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin also denied those accusations, acknowledging that the bank "does 
choose its contestants" very carefully. Last year, Premier Bank, which has now 
sponsored the last three pageant winners, interviewed Stern three times. "I 
thought I was going for president of the bank," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Dalmatin was a judge at the Miss Northridge contest. As a previous 
contestant in Miss Teen California, she was regarded as something of an expert 
-- Sunday's competition was, in fact, her ninth since she was 11. Premier Bank 
gave her a tape of last year's event, which she carefully monitored to see how 
the women walked and how they delivered their speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dalmatin of Northridge moves on to assume her duties. "I want to be a role 
model," she said. "I want to be a woman who has a say in what's going on in 
this world." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin won a $500 scholarship to a modeling school, a one night's stay in a 
fantasy suite of her choice, a picture frame, a gift certificate from 
Bullock's, and a $600 registration fee for the Miss California Pageant, which 
she plans on entering in Palm Springs in August. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to take another traditional walk.

A PARENT'S GUIDE TO CHOOSING RIGHT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF, Melinkoff is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Selecting a summer camp used to be a relatively simple procedure for parents. 
Most facilities offered the same predictable menu of archery, swimming and 
silly campfire songs. Today parents and children looking for the perfect fit 
must sift through dazzling brochures and slick videos of dozens of camps. Do 
the youngsters want a day camp or a sleep-over camp? Computer classes or 
horseback riding? Water sports or drama? 
</P>
<P>
Parents who are interested in sending their children to camps -- which range 
from local day camps to exotic High Sierra sleep-over sites -- would do well to 
start studying their pamphlets and tapes and attending open houses. April is 
the traditional sign-up month, and popular camps fill up fast. 
</P>
<P>
Here are guidelines for picking a summer camp: 
</P>
<P>
COSTS -- A family's financial situation will probably be the most important 
factor in selecting a site. Day camps begin at about $65 a week, whereas two 
weeks in the High Sierra can run as high as $1,300. For working parents with 
young children who have 11 weeks of school vacation, day camps run by such 
organizations as the YMCA and Los Angeles city parks and recreation provide 
full-time programs, often with extended hours from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., at the 
lowest prices. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect luxurious environments. Such day camps use public facilities 
as much as possible, and schedules are filled with trips to parks, beaches, 
Olvera Street and Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
More expensive day camps (which can run up to $300 a week) frequently offer a 
higher counselor-to-child ratio and a more ambitious schedule of activities, 
according to their catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
Many camps charge for optional activities in addition to the basic weekly fee. 
These options may be such things as an extra hour of horseback riding in the 
late afternoon, computer classes and a trip to Disneyland (which one local camp 
prices at $100). 
</P>
<P>
What makes camp so expensive? "Insurance, staff and bus leasing," said Joyce 
Hurst, one of the directors of Meadow Oaks Day Camp in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
STAFFING -- Parents should ask about counselor-to-camper ratios. Camps 
accredited by the American Camping Assn., for example, must maintain a ratio of 
1 to 10 or less. (The ACA also requires that counselors sleep in the cabin with 
their charges at sleep-away camps and that counselors be high school 
graduates.) In addition, parents may want to ask what percentage of the 
counselors -- and campers -- have spent previous seasons at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Another consideration is the number of children at the camp. Some youngsters 
would do better in a smaller camp than in a larger facility with a lower 
counselor-to-camper ratio. 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVITIES -- Although some facilities cater to special interests -- computers, 
swimming, theater, for example -- most camps offer a variety of activities. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive camps frequently have spacious grounds, swimming pools, 
stables and horses, tennis courts and programs that include gymnastics, 
physical challenge courses, go-carts and dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
But camps run by community organizations are rarely as well-equipped. The key 
questions to ask at community-oriented day camps involve scheduling. Where will 
your child spend most of the day? Is there a lot of busing from place to place? 
Who drives the bus? How many different sites will a child visit in a typical 
day? 
</P>
<P>
LENGTH OF STAY -- Sleep-over camps typically schedule two-week sessions 
throughout the summer. Many day camps allow parents to sign up for two, three, 
four or five days a week, but camp directors recommend five days. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common is three days," said Saul Rowen, director of Cali-Camp in 
Topanga. "But we would recommend five days a week for a month or five weeks 
rather than three days a week for eight weeks. It's more beneficial to the 
camper. Especially when it comes to learning skills, like horseback riding and 
water skiing, it helps to have that daily repetition." 
</P>
<P>
READINESS -- Preschoolers 
</P>
<P>
who are attending nursery school should be able to segue into day camp with 
little difficulty, Rowen said, because they are already familiar with a 
schedule that changes activities every 45 minutes to an hour and have learned 
to interact with peers. 
</P>
<P>
Camp officials and counselors say children are ready for sleep-away camp at 
varying ages. But a more important question may be: Are the parents ready? 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell on a tour," said Lynn Lyneis, summer camp director at Cottontail 
Ranch in Malibu. "The parents will think up negatives. They say, 'Look how far 
it is to the bathroom!' instead of 'Doesn't this look like fun?' We have a lot 
of protective parents around here." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be within driving distance," said Margaret Denney, whose 
10-year-old daughter Amy has been going to Cottontail Ranch for three years. 
"Just in case something happened, I'd be able to get there. Of course, nothing 
has, but it gave me peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Parents know if it's the right camp for them when they visit," says 
Cali-Camp's Rowen. Most local camps with permanent grounds hold open houses on 
spring weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Although many day camps welcome parents' visits, they can be the undoing of a 
stay at a sleep-away camp. Parents are urged not to call the camp and speak 
with their children -- or risk setting off an avalanche of homesickness. 
Campers are encouraged to write home regularly but not to make phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child is trying to adapt to a camping situation, it defeats what we're 
trying to do to make them more independent. It's better to work through the 
homesickness than to give into it," Lyneis said. 
</P>
<P>
Though parents are concerned about safety, the campers are worried about making 
friends and having to take a shower with other people. "I found an 8-year-old 
showering at midnight," Lyneis said. "Half the kids wind up showering in their 
bathing suits." 
</P>
<P>
Both Cottontail Ranch and Cali-Camp report that more than half of their campers 
don't know anyone else when they arrive. Counselors suggest that parents assure 
their children that they won't be the only ones without a buddy from home. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to camping is to be able to change," Lyneis said. Change schedules, 
change patterns, change friends. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a sampling of day and sleep-away camps. Sleep-away camps close 
to the San Fernando Valley area:

<P>
BERNARDI IS ONLY COUNCIL MEMBER FACING A RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Portrayed as too old and too set in his ways to represent the ethnically 
changing northeast San Fernando Valley, Ernani Bernardi, the 77-year-old dean 
of the Los Angeles City Council, faces a difficult runoff against a political 
newcomer after Tuesday's municipal primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi was the only one of eight council members up for reelection who did 
not win outright, drawing 42% of the vote. Instead, he faces a June 6 
confrontation with the closest of his seven rivals, Lyle Hall, a 49-year-old 
former president of the city firefighters' union who had strong labor support. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year council veteran blamed his showing in Tuesday's election on "a very 
slick, hard-hitting campaign against me which involved a torrent of last-minute 
mailings full of distortions," a low voter turnout and a large field of 
candidates. In addition, he was running in a largely new 7th District, which 
was redrawn by the council in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi predicted that he will make a strong comeback in the runoff. "It will 
be an entirely different campaign," he said at a packed news conference in his 
City Hall office. "It will be one against one instead of one against seven." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a fire captain who received the department's Medal of Valor, said the 
election results simply showed voters are ready for a change. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the city, council incumbents Marvin Braude, Joan Milke Flores, 
Gilbert W. Lindsay, Gloria Molina, Joy Picus, Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky 
were reelected to four-year terms, as were City Atty. James K. Hahn and 
Controller Rick Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
In the council's 7th District, political analysts said Bernardi was hurt by the 
low voter turnout -- about 23% of the city's registered voters went to the 
polls -- and the large field. The field included one candidate, Irene Tovar, 
who had strong roots to the district's fast-growing Latino community, and 
another, Al Dib, the only Republican in the nonpartisan race who aggressively 
courted the GOP vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had too many candidates and too few votes," Bernardi's political 
consultant, Lynn Wessell said, adding that Bernardi supporters stayed away from 
the polls, believing that their candidate would easily win. "Some of our people 
just didn't think they needed to vote." 
</P>
<P>
But Arnold Steinberg, a political consultant not involved in the campaign, said 
Hall's attack on Bernardi's age and council absenteeism "struck a responsive 
chord" among voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever someone doesn't do well, it's easy to blame low turnout," Steinberg 
said, adding he doubted that voter apathy was the sole factor behind Bernardi's 
poor showing. 
</P>
<P>
"The change in district had to make a big difference," said Councilwoman Picus, 
another representative from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 council redistricting, Bernardi lost many of the Anglo, 
working-class neighborhoods in Van Nuys that provided the core of his support. 
The new district is still heavily blue collar and middle class, but it is 
nearly 50% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said Bernardi, who has never been in a runoff since he was first elected 
in 1961, did not campaign hard until the closing days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has a very good chance of winning . . . but needs an aggressive 
campaign," she said. "He's never done that before. We're all telling him to do 
it. . . . Ernie didn't wage a campaign until the very end." The big field, she 
said, made it difficult because each one could pick off a little piece of his 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
History has not been kind to incumbents forced into runoff elections. Of the 
three City Council members forced into runoffs in the last 12 years, only 
Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson survived a 1981 battle against Mike Woo, but she 
was defeated by Woo four years later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scrappy Fighter 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who has a reputation as a scrappy fighter of the city bureaucracy, 
said he was ready to fight for his seat. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a contest between someone who is independent and someone who is 
beholden to the special interests," he said, alluding to Hall's support from 
the city labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's campaign manager, Harvey Englander, promised more of the same 
hard-hitting tactics. He said future mailings will continue emphasizing Hall's 
"youth and vigor" and that Bernardi's reputation as the council's maverick has 
hurt the district. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Englander, watching a televised news report of an energetic 
Hall followed by a tired Bernardi sitting behind a smoked-glass cubicle at his 
campaign headquarters refusing to comment on the race, remarked: "Ernani 
Bernardi looked beaten in that photograph we saw on television tonight. It'll 
be easy to raise funds now." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Bernardi said: "If my math serves me correctly, I need 
to get only one out of every four votes cast for one of my opponents (other 
than Hall) in order to gain the margin necessary for victory. The odds are now 
in my favor." 
</P>
<P>
As for his age and health, he said, "I'm just as aggressive as I have ever 
been." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Answer Questions 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi contended that Hall distorted his attendance record. But 15 minutes 
into his press conference, Bernardi refused to answer any more questions and 
loudly hummed "Stars and Stripes Forever." 
</P>
<P>
Both runoff contenders immediately began courting the other candidates in an 
effort to win their endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
In other council races, Picus narrowly defeated five challengers to win 
reelection in the West San Fernando Valley's 3rd District. She attributed her 
close race to the low turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are angry vote," she said. "If they're not voting, then they're 
pretty satisfied with the status quo" and with "the way the city is being run." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky easily won reelection in the 5th District, which extends from the 
Westside to the Valley. His toughest foe, environmental activist Laura M. Lake, 
had tried to weaken Yaroslavsky by blaming him for the district's considerable 
development woes. But Lake garnered only 33% of the vote. She blamed her loss 
on Yaroslavsky's high name recognition and fund-raising skills. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th District, Woo easily turned back challenges from four candidates, 
each of whom had hoped to bring together a potpourri of disaffected voters 
unhappy with Woo over everything from Hollywood redevelopment to unreturned 
constituent phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who outspent his leading challenger by more than 10 to 1, described his 
showing as a "strong mandate." He attributed his success to a "textbook 
campaign," which identified likely voters and relied on extensive precinct 
walking, telephone banks, campaign coffees and targeted mailings in his Silver 
Lake-to-Studio City district. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Hills attorney Berndt Lohr-Schmidt, Woo's No. 1 challenger who 
finished with a disappointing 16% of the vote, said Woo's victory resulted more 
from low voter turnout than widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, whose 15th District extends from Watts to San Pedro, outpolled 
Wilmington activist Jo Ann Wysocki by a nearly 3-1 margin. Flores -- who 
outspent Wysocki 33 to 1 -- described the victory as the equivalent of "getting 
an A on your report card."

GAS IS TURNED OFF ON GRILL AND AN ERA; 
</P>
<P>
BLVD. CAFE ON OLD ROUTE 66 IN DUARTE SERVES ITS LAST BURGER AFTER 43 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody kept a tally of how many hamburgers were fried on the Blvd. Cafe's grill 
before they turned it off for good, but the number must be astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
When Shirley Halburian's family took over the little wood-slat orange juice and 
hamburger stand in Duarte in 1946, it fronted Route 66. The highway was "the 
mother road" back then, a humming 2,200-mile stretch of blacktop that connected 
heartland America to California. Just about anyone coming to Los Angeles had to 
pass the Blvd. Cafe, which got its name because the full "Boulevard" wouldn't 
fit on the sign above it. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard when I was a kid was that everybody gets to California on Route 
66," said Halburian, 49, during an unfettered closing celebration at the cafe 
over the weekend, complete with a jukebox pumping out oldies-but-goodies and 
family members passing out free beer and food. 
</P>
<P>
The Blvd. Cafe, seized through eminent domain by the city's redevelopment 
agency, will be bulldozed next week to make way for a long-planned seven-acre 
shopping center. The Trammell Crow Development Co. project will be anchored by 
a supermarket, a city spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
It's the end of an era, proclaimed a sign attached to a cafe wall. 
</P>
<P>
"My father used to love the highway," said Halburian, co-owner of the stand 
with her brother, Richard Tomasian. "On Sunday evenings, he'd stand out front 
and watch the endless ribbon of headlights coming back to Los Angeles from Las 
Vegas, Palm Springs, anywhere east." 
</P>
<P>
In those days, the Blvd., with its refrigerator full of fresh-squeezed orange 
juice, beckoned like an oasis to an endless stream of tourists, Okies, Las 
Vegas gamblers, con men, Santa Anita jockeys and movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
When Susie and Tommy Tomasian (Halburian's parents) and Susie's brother, Jimmy 
Zoker, transplants from Connecticut, bought the stand 43 years ago, the highway 
that sliced through Duarte was lined with citrus orchards and avocado groves. 
Now, what remains of Route 66 in the San Gabriel Valley is a series of 
boulevards, most of them lined with franchise stores. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the small businesses that served highway travelers have long since 
disappeared. The consensus among guests at the closing party on Saturday was 
that the Blvd. Cafe was "the last of the old hamburger stands." 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't get it," said Richard Tomasian, 60. "Nowadays, they're tearing 
other places down so they can make them look like this." 
</P>
<P>
Behind him, in the enclosed part of the cafe, Tomasian's wife, Doness, had just 
launched into a spirited jitterbug with one of the regulars. A crowd of more 
than 100 milled around a funeral wreath, propped in front of the building, with 
black-sprayed carnations and gladioli and a ribbon inscribed "Good-bye, Old 
Friend." 
</P>
<P>
"My father used to bring me here when I was 4 years old," said Dennis 
Reichenfeld, a lanky man who works as a general contractor. "We'd always stop 
here to get a burger. It was his way of being with the baby. Same with me now. 
My wife works weekends and I bring my son here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Times Recalled 
</P>
<P>
Though the founders of the Blvd. Cafe, Tommy and Susie Tomasian and "Uncle 
Jimmy" Zoker, are all gone now, they seemed a living presence at the closing 
party. The stories were flowing as fast as the beer. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, it was recalled how Tommy, the principal chef, was the organizing 
force behind the operation, inspecting the meat, stamping out the hamburger 
patties by hand, keeping the customers happy. "He wouldn't let us close on 
Christmas because he had to cook Christmas dinner for some of his older 
customers," Shirley Halburian said. 
</P>
<P>
As the party heated up, so did some of the customers, openly criticizing the 
Duarte City Council, which serves as the city's redevelopment board. "If this 
is redevelopment, then I don't believe in it," said Dennis Schwarz, pointing 
out that one supermarket in town had already closed and another is scheduled to 
close next month. "So the brain trust at City Hall says, 'Let's build another 
one.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requests for Market Told 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Ontal, the city's public information director, said that a major 
supermarket is the type of business most often requested by Duarte residents. 
Providing some material comfort to the owners, the city will pay them $1.1 
million for the 1 1/4-acre property, which includes the family's three-bedroom 
home on Sesmas Street. 
</P>
<P>
But that was little solace to the celebrants. By sundown, they had consumed 25 
cases of beer, 250 hamburgers and a bushel of cole slaw, all on the house. 
Dancers had spilled out behind the cafe. With the refrigerator empty, some were 
taking up a collection to get more beer. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, a bittersweet occasion, Richard Tomasian said the next day. "There 
were a lot of tears at the end," he said. "There were a lot of roughnecks, but 
they were crying, too. I guess a lot of people figured they'd never see each 
other again." 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATCHDOG PANEL URGED FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens' advisory commission to the Long Beach Police Department voted 
unanimously Wednesday night to recommend creation of an independent city agency 
to investigate allegations of officer misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Safety Advisory Commission also voted to revive the idea of a 
citizens review board to hear certain types of police misconduct cases, 
including brutality allegations and in-custody deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The ideas were proposed by a committee formed in the wake of the January 
incident in which Don Jackson, a black off-duty Hawthorne police sergeant, 
appeared to have been pushed through a plate-glass window by a white Long Beach 
police officer, Mark Dickey. Dickey faces misdemeanor criminal charges stemming 
from the incident, which was secretly videotaped by a television crew. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's proposals now go to the City Council, which last year rejected 
calls for a citizen review board. But Commission Chairman Larry Davis said he 
believes the Jackson incident has softened opposition to reforming the 
complaint process.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 HELD IN KILLING OF 'GOOD SAMARITAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police have arrested three of four youths suspected in the April 2 
killing of a North Hollywood man who chased the group after they tried to steal 
a neighbor's pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old alleged triggerman and a 17-year-old companion were arrested at 
a home in North Hollywood, and the third suspect, also 16, was arrested while 
walking along a street in the community, Lt. Ron LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers were booked on suspicion of murder and were being held without 
bail at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are looking for a fourth juvenile in the shooting of Darris 
Garvin, 37, who apparently surprised the youths as they were attempting to 
steal a pickup truck that belonged to another tenant of his apartment complex. 
Garvin chased them for a block before one shot him in the abdomen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just an innocent Good Samaritan," LaRue said. "And he ends up paying 
the ultimate price."

As Los Angeles heads into a crucial period, faced with problems of traffic 
congestion, air quality and overdevelopment, less than 5% of the population 
picked the man who will be the city's mayor for the next four years. (Tom 
Bradley, the incumbent, in case you hadn't heard.) 
</P>
<P>
In a city of 3.36 million people, just over 156,000 registered voters cast 
ballots for Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
How low was His Honor's vote count? For comparison purposes, the figure would 
fall short of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The crowd for one Hollywood Christmas Parade, two Pink Floyd concerts at 
the Coliseum or a three-game Mets series at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The number of people who own water beds in the city (an estimated 225,000). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The number of dogs registered with the city (230,000). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The number of vehicles using the Santa Monica Freeway in a 12-hour period 
(158,000). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The number of people in the city who say they regularly roller skate (about 
400,000). 
</P>
<P>
Some have blamed Mayor Bradley for failing to inspire the electorate with his 
low-key style. It should be noted, however, that a boisterous style didn't 
always work so well for the early leaders of the dusty little pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful cast of characters has included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles Mayor Stephen Foster (1854-56), who solidified his 
law-and-order credentials by resigning from office to help lynch a convicted 
killer whose execution had been stayed by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mayor Damien Marchessault (1859-65), a one-time New Orleans gambler, who 
culminated a controversy over the city's faulty wooden water pipes by 
committing suicide in the City Council chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mayor Joel Turner (1868-70), who startled visiting Secretary of State 
William Seward by "ambushing" his stagecoach near the Cahuenga Pass with a band 
of troubadours described by one writer of the time as "a barefoot Indian 
drummer, a ditto fifer, a mestizo flageolet player, an old (man) named 
Pinacarte with his flute, a skinny fiddler and a fat fellow with an accordion . 
. . all tricked out in ribbons and spangles in old-time Californian style." 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Mayor A.C. Harper (1906-09), who resigned after an investigation into 
reports that he frequented local brothels and that his aides were involved in a 
plot to sell the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
FASHION NOTE: When she accompanied officers on a recent "rock house" raid, 
Nancy Reagan wore a blue Los Angeles Police Department windbreaker that bore a 
"Nancy" nameplate. Today, she's expected to don another personalized blue team 
jacket, which was presented to her at the White House after last year's World 
Series. She's throwing out the first ball at the Dodgers home opener.

Winchell's Donut Shops, sellers of 125,000 cups of coffee per day in Southern 
California, has reduced the size of its small cups by 16%, to 10 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd gotten complaints that our small cup was too large," a spokesman said. 
"We'd find cups that still had coffee in them in the trash cans." 
</P>
<P>
The company also increased the price of a small coffee by a nickel to 55 cents, 
though no one had complained that the price was too low. "Rising costs" was the 
reason cited.

A typographical error in a newspaper advertisement the other day might have 
given the impression that the Time of Your Life Expo at the Los Angeles

"Crafts" gallery, not a "Grafts" Gallery.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DAUGHTER SENTENCED IN MOTHER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A radio broadcaster accused of involuntary manslaughter in the death of her 
bedridden mother was placed on four years' probation Wednesday after pleading 
no contest to a reduced charge of abusing the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major ordered Cynthia Jeter Green, 
39, to perform 300 hours of community service and to pay a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who has worked at several radio stations in the Los Angeles area, was 
arrested at her North Hollywood home Dec. 27 after calling paramedics to report 
that her 77-year-old mother had suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Jeter was rushed to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City, 
where she died. Authorities said that when she was found, the elderly woman 
weighed just 70 pounds and was covered with feces and maggots.

3 BOND MEASURES, 1 CHARTER CHANGE PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles voters approved three bond measures to improve libraries, police 
stations and other city facilities but narrowly rejected another one that would 
have helped finance rehabilitation of aging, low-income housing and would have 
provided $10 million to shelter the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
With the rejection of Proposition 3, some low-income housing advocates were 
already calling on the City Council to head off the loss of thousands of homes 
for the poor. Most of the buildings are in some of the city's poorest 
neighborhoods in East and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Interest Loans 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure, which drew just 64.8% of the 66% yes votes needed to pass, 
would have provided low-interest loans for the buildings' owners, many of whom 
cannot get conventional financing, to bring them up to earthquake safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 1, a $53.4-million bond measure to build three branch libraries in 
the San Fernando Valley and to improve 26 other branch libraries throughout the 
city, passed with 68.3% of the vote. Proposition, 2, which calls for $176 
million in bonds to build and remodel police stations, drew 68.7%. Proposition 
4, a $60-million bond issue for installation of fire sprinklers and removal of 
asbestos in municipal buildings, won with 68.4% 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved one proposed amendment to the City Charter but rejected 
another. Charter Amendment 5 would have reduced the number of votes required on 
the 15-member council to approve employee pay raises but was defeated 42.3% to 
57.6%. But Charter Amendment 6, which raises the limit on funds that can be 
transferred within the same city department without approval of the mayor and 
City Council, won 58% to 42%. Both Charter proposals required only a simple 
majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Older Buildings 
</P>
<P>
The rejected $100-million housing bond measure would have helped preserve an 
estimated 15,000 older brick buildings. Housing advocates fear their loss would 
sharply exacerbate the city's affordable-housing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council and the mayor have to do something or else we'll be 
displacing thousands of people," said Alice Callaghan of the Skid Row Housing 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
If the buildings are condemned, many of the poor residents could end up 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll pay for it one way or another," said Susan Romeo, co-manager of the 
Proposition 3 campaign. "We can save the buildings or we can pay for the 
homeless."

HALL'S LABOR BACKING MAY PROVE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD IN RUNOFF

Mingling in the crowd of volunteers at Los Angeles City Council candidate Lyle 
Hall's campaign headquarters in Sylmar on election night were many union 
members, some of whom do not even live in the 7th District. 
</P>
<P>
Their presence highlighted both the strengths and the Achilles' heel of the 
fire captain's coming runoff campaign against veteran Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, Hall's supporters acknowledge. His organized-labor connection gives 
Hall a ready-made constituency and bank of campaign help to draw from, but it 
also makes him vulnerable to charges that he is a "special-interest" candidate. 
Bernardi on Wednesday accused Hall of being "beholden" to labor interests. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 49, was raised in Burbank and has been a Los Angeles firefighter for more 
than a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 2-inch, 220-pound Hall joined the Fire Department in 1962, working 
his way through the ranks to his current position as captain at Fire Station 75 
in Mission Hills. Two of his three brothers also work for the department. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall of his Sylmar campaign headquarters hangs a commendation for his 
rescue of three police officers under gunfire in 1969 in South-Central Los 
Angeles. For that deed, he won the Fire Department's Medal of Valor. 
</P>
<P>
"You do what you have to do, and then you worry about it later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in North Dakota, he married at 17. He and his wife had four children 
before they were divorced. He remarried, and he and his second wife, Kitty, 
have two children. They live in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Hall became a well-known figure in City Hall, and demonstrated his political 
skills as a lobbyist for the 2,700-member United Firefighters union from 1976 
to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, the union spent $25,000 in an unsuccessful effort to defeat 
Bernardi because of his role in a campaign to limit police and firefighter 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he sees his labor support as a plus in the heavily blue-collar 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But he also hopes to campaign on other issues. Specifically, he said he wants 
to reclaim the district -- street by street -- from the grip of gangs and crime 
through more police officers and innovative prevention and rehabilitation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Hall took accumulated sick leave and vacation days to campaign full 
time for the council, his first try for political office. It was an idea he had 
been discussing for two years with Harvey Englander, an aggressive political 
consultant who is known for his campaign mailings and who engineered Michael 
Woo's 1985 defeat of Councilwoman Peggy Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
When Hall announced his campaign for the City Council last December, he pledged 
not to say anything bad about the incumbent. But as the election grew closer, 
he sent out a spate of mailers, many of them attacking Bernardi for his age and 
absence from council meetings.

The family of a Redding man convicted of murdering his wife is posting a 
$10,000 reward for information that will clear him or lead to another suspect. 
Members of Dale Crawford's family said they would announce the offer in an 
advertisement in a local newspaper and on flyers in public places where the 
victim reportedly spent her last hours. Crawford's court-appointed attorney, 
Jack Suter, has filed a motion for a new trial, claiming among other things 
that newly discovered evidence will show that a key prosecution witness 
committed perjury. Crawford, a 33-year-old sawmill worker, was convicted in 
January of beating his wife, Theresa, to death last year. The alleged murder 
weapon, a baseball bat, and the bedspread allegedly used to wrap her body have 
never been found.

At least six masked attackers stormed the stock exchange in Frankfurt, West 
Germany, beating employees and throwing firebombs onto the main trading floor, 
authorities said. Two people were injured. A police spokesman said the attack, 
carried out before trading began, was apparently intended to draw attention to 
a nationwide prison hunger strike by members and sympathizers of the terrorist 
Red Army Faction. Three suspects in the attack were captured. Supporters of the 
prison protest also claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a branch of 
the West German electronics firm AEG, the spokesman said.

Industry spewed at least 22.5 billion pounds of toxic and cancer-causing 
chemicals into the nation's air, land and water in 1987, the government said in 
an unprecedented report that officials called "startling." In releasing the 
first nationwide summary of toxic emissions, a top Environmental Protection 
Agency official said the enormous amount of chemicals released was 
"unacceptably high" and that the report underlined the need for industry to 
reduce toxic pollution. Worse, EPA officials said the figure of 22.5 billion 
pounds undoubtedly underestimates the actual amount of toxic materials 
released, since the report does not cover all chemicals nor does it include 
emissions from smaller companies and certain industries. The EPA report is the 
compilation of more than 75,000 annual toxic release disclosure forms filed 
with the government by about 17,500 factories and industrial facilities across 
the nation. The reports were required under the "community right-to-know" 
provisions of the 1986 Superfund reauthorization law.

Soviet arms control inspectors decided to conduct "short-notice" inspections at 
Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Huntsville, Ala., under terms of the treaty banning 
medium-range nuclear weapons, the Pentagon announced. The Soviet inspection 
teams had arrived in Washington on Tuesday. Cmdr. Ken Pease, a Pentagon 
spokesman, said one 10-member team specified a visit to a missile storage 
facility at the Redstone Army Depot in Huntsville. The other 10-member team 
asked to inspect Complex 16 at Patrick Air Force Base near Cape Canaveral. 
Complex 16 was once used as a launch test center for the Pershing 2 and 
ground-launched cruise missiles that are covered by the treaty.

A homeless man was charged with nine counts of murder after telling police he 
set a fire that swept through a Peoria, Ill., apartment house, killing seven 
children and two young mothers, a prosecutor said. Joe Pickens, 34, who has no 
permanent address, was charged in the Tuesday fire, the deadliest in Peoria's 
history, said Peoria County State's Atty. Kevin Lyons. Pickens was charged with 
criminal trespass, a misdemeanor, just hours after the fire. But Lyons said 
murder charges were lodged after Pickens confessed to setting fire to a 
sleeper-sofa on the first floor, igniting a fast-moving fire that swept up a 
stairwell to the second floor where three families slept.

A two-thirds majority of adults claim to have adopted the "designated driver" 
concept when attending social functions at which alcoholic beverages are 
served. Under this plan, a volunteer refrains from drinking in order to drive 
his or her companions safely home. The designated driver concept has been 
heavily promoted on television as part of the nationwide effort to curb drunken 
driving. This public service campaign has gained widespread attention. 
According to a recent Gallup Poll, 67% have seen one or more of the designated 
driver TV messages, up from 54% in a survey taken last fall.

The National Guard has more than 100 computers and close to 5,000 terminals 
that are collecting dust because it has been slow in purchasing software needed 
to run them, a House subcommittee was told. The Army National Guard Bureau, 
believing its Burroughs 1900s computers would be obsolete by 1986, bought 119 
Unisys 5000 minicomputers, about 5,000 terminals and hundreds of printers and 
other equipment as part of a June, 1986, contract. But units in 54 states and 
territories are still using the Burroughs 1900s because they lack the software 
to operate the Unisys computers, which may be obsolete after 1991. "In military 
terms, this would be analogous to buying missiles without guidance systems, 
troop carriers that do not protect troops and attack helicopters without 
engines," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations. The computers remain 
idle with the staff occasionally opening boxes to see if they still run or 
using them "for games like tick-tack-toe," said Richard Chervenak, a 
subcommittee investigator.

U.S. policy has hardened against new Israeli settlements in the occupied 
territories, and the United States will no longer defend Israeli expansion 
before the United Nations, a senior Administration official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking with United Press International on the condition he not 
be identified, defined what he said is a difference between the Bush 
Administration and past administrations: "We will not, we cannot, support 
further establishment of settlements, and they (the Israelis) shouldn't expect 
us to support or defend them in the United Nations. I'm not sure that's been 
done before." 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, while criticizing settlements as "an obstacle to 
peace," did not actively oppose them. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, saying that further settlements are necessary for the 
security of the state, has announced the establishment of two new settlements 
in the last two weeks.

WEINTRAUB CHALLENGER BLAMES LOSS ON LACK OF UTLA SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The teachers union and the Democratic Party could have easily forced Los 
Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub into a runoff election if they 
had chosen to back her opponents with money and volunteers, one defeated 
challenger said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks physician and screenwriter Barry Pollack was less than 1,000 votes 
short of forcing East Valley incumbent Weintraub into a June 6 runoff. A third 
candidate, Ernesto Llanes, received about 13% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who won a fourth term on the board, received 28,510 votes, about 
51.7% of the vote, according to semi-official results. A 50% plus one vote 
majority is needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said financial and volunteer support from United Teachers-Los Angeles 
could have won the union another ally on the board, namely him. UTLA, which 
gave strong support to West Valley incumbent Julie Korenstein and Westside 
challenger Mark Slavkin, remained neutral in the Weintraub race. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the UTLA made a grave judgment error," said Pollack, who received 
19,374 votes, about 35% of the ballots cast. "Weintraub outspent me 2 to 1, has 
10 years of name recognition and only managed to squeak by me with about a 1 
1/2% margin of victory." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said that if Pollack had received UTLA support, she would have run a 
more aggressive campaign. She said she spent only about half of the $100,000 
raised for her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question people threw up their hands about schools" and voted to 
oust incumbents, Weintraub said of the close outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said he told UTLA officials early in the race that he would support the 
union in the stalled contract talks that threaten to escalate into a teachers' 
strike by next month. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 22,000-teacher union contributed a total of more than $100,000, 
volunteered to walk precincts and telephoned voters to help Korenstein defeat 
her five challengers and to assist Slavkin in forcing incumbent Alan Gershman 
into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Although Slavkin was able to force Gershman into the runoff, the results of the 
costly union effort in the West Valley race are still unclear. Korenstein is 
less than 50 votes above the 50% plus one majority she needs for a victory over 
Principal Gerald Horowitz, with potentially hundreds of uncounted ballots 
remaining, city election officials said. Final results are not expected for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA took no position in the Weintraub race because "there was no strong force 
wanting Roberta out of office" among teachers and union officials, UTLA 
spokesman Don Schrack said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack also said he is disappointed that such Democratic Party leaders as Rep. 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky failed to endorse him even though he 
received the party's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, a Republican, received her party's endorsement in the school board 
race, which is nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
Parent activist Barbara Romey, who finished third behind Horowitz in the West 
Valley race, said she is pleased to have raised issues such as the reopening of 
closed Valley schools and the continuing opposition to year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
Romey, who split conservative votes with Horowitz, said she has not decided 
whether she will make any endorsements if there is a runoff. Romey lost to 
Korenstein in a bitterly fought 1987 runoff election, which was held to fill 
the two years remaining in former board member David Armor's term. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, a political newcomer, said his strong showing reflects the 
community's growing dissatisfaction with the school district and with 
Korenstein's strong ties with the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the district's current offer to teachers is adequate," Horowitz said.

ANGELS STOP ATHLETICS AGAIN, 5-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They might be giants at full strength and full roster, but without Jose 
Canseco, and now Mark McGwire, the Oakland Athletics have been reintroduced to 
the rest of the pack in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
With McGwire joining Canseco on the disabled list Wednesday night, the suddenly 
vulnerable A's went down to their second consecutive defeat at the hands of the 
Angels, losing, 5-0, before an Anaheim Stadium crowd of 24,650. 
</P>
<P>
That's one run in 20 innings for the Athletics, who have been outscored, 12-1, 
the last two days. Tuesday, Bert Blyleven beat them, 7-1, with a four-hitter, 
and Wednesday, Kirk McCaskill, Greg Minton and Bryan Harvey combined on a 
three-hit shutout. 
</P>
<P>
And that lower back strain McGwire had been complaining about? It turned out to 
be a herniated disk, an injury that put McGwire immediately on the 15-day 
disabled list. He is expected to miss a minimum of three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
With Canseco probably sidelined through mid-May because of a torn ligament in 
his left wrist, the A's find themselves in mid-April missing their lineup's 
heart, a duo that produced 74 home runs and 223 RBIs in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco and McGwire have become the Bashed Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
And the mighty Athletics, winners of 104 games last season, have become just 
another contender in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are some teams thinking, 'They're not the same without those 
guys,' " Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa said. "Our challenge is to show that 
we're still a very good ballclub without them." 
</P>
<P>
Without them, LaRussa has been starting rookie Felix Jose in right field in 
place of Canseco and will resort to Dial-A-First-Baseman to replace McGwire. 
LaRussa said third baseman Carney Lansford, catcher Terry Steinbach, outfielder 
Stan Javier and Wednesday's triple-A recall, Billy Beane, will all play some at 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be interesting," LaRussa said. "We've felt all along we have a deep 
ballclub. Here's our chance to show it." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire will return to Oakland today to begin physical therapy. Last year, 
McGwire missed seven days toward the end of the regular season because of 
similar back pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had back problems most of my life," he said. "I didn't think it would be 
this bad for me, (but) this was probably going to happen to me sometime." 
</P>
<P>
The pain, caused by a spinal disk rubbing against a nerve, forced McGwire to 
make a choice: Rest now . . . or pay later. 
</P>
<P>
"If I kept (playing in this condition), I'd eventually have to have surgery 
like Dave Winfield," McGwire said. Winfield, the New York Yankees outfielder, 
figures to be sidelined through late July after undergoing back surgery in late 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Life without Canseco and McGwire has been difficult for the A's: Seven hits in 
two days and only three hits Wednesday night -- two of the infield variety. The 
only line-drive hit of the game belonged to No. 9 batter Walt Weiss, who had a 
single to right field with two out in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, 2-0 after limiting Oakland to two hits in six innings, broached the 
subject of the Bashless A's gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fairly obvious their lineup is not as strong without those two 
guys in there," McCaskill said. "They still have a very good team, but those 
are two of the best players in baseball. They've got to miss them." 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitchers certainly didn't. When McCaskill was removed by Angel Manager 
Doug Rader after six innings because of a stiff back, Minton came on to allow 
one scratch single in two innings before Harvey retired the side in order in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
On a bad night for backs, McCaskill insisted his stiffness was nothing more 
than "standard," adding: "I could've kept pitching. I've had a little stiffness 
since my last start. It's probably due to the damp weather. It didn't worry me 
one iota." 
</P>
<P>
With Angel starters throwing complete games two of the previous three days, 
Rader saw the moment as a good time to get his top two relief pitchers some 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking all things into consideration, even though (the stiffness) wasn't 
major, coupled with Minton and Harvey needing work, shutting him down was the 
proper thing to do," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the Angels had a 3-0 advantage, courtesy of a two-run triple by Mark 
McLemore and Dante Bichette's second home run in four days. This homer, coming 
on an 0-1 pitch by loser Curt Young (0-2), was measured at 418 feet over the 
left-center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing made it 4-0 with a bases-empty home run in the seventh, before 
Bichette drove in the Angels' fifth and final run with an eighth-inning double. 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing four of the Angels' first nine games, Bichette leads the club 
in batting (.357) and is second in RBIs (4). He also is tied with Downing for 
most home runs (2). 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of production the A's are accustomed to -- production they'll 
have to find from new sources the rest of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's still early, but entering Wednesday's game, the maligned Angel pitching 
staff had an earned-run average of 3.00, with the five starters checking in at 
3.31. Last season, Angel starters finished with a composite ERA of 4.56. "If 
there's been a real bright spot so far, starting pitching is it," Angel Manager 
Doug Rader said. "I'm elated. It's been as big a plus as we've had." Bert 
Blyleven, 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA after Tuesday night's four-hitter, says the Angel 
rotation has drawn inspiration from the heavy criticism it received during 
spring training. "So much has been said about the negative part of our ballclub 
being pitching," Blyleven said. "We take a lot of pride in keeping the ballclub 
in every game we pitch. We're on a mission. If Mike Witt goes nine innings and 
I go nine innings, it adds a sense of competition among the starters. I'm sure 
Kirk McCaskill wants to go nine innings (Wednesday). All that creates positive 
thinking, which is what we need." 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield missed his first start of the season because of the 
chest injury he sustained Tuesday. Officially, Schofield's diagnosis is 
tightness of the right pectoral muscle, which, basically, prohibits him from 
loosening up his throwing arm. Schofield was available only for pinch-running 
duty Wednesday night. . . . So Punny It Hurts: Z Channel broadcaster Joe Torre 
watched Oakland's Curt Young brush back Glenn Hoffman with an inside pitch and 
mused, "Is that called 'dustin' Hoffman?' "

KINGS ARE DOWN TO FINAL CHANCE FOR NEEDED VICTORY IN EDMONTON

<P>
As Wayne Gretzky said, it's amazing what one victory will do. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he and the Kings know what one more loss to the Edmonton Oilers will 
do -- end what is supposed to be the Kings' renaissance season. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky set up two power-play goals and then scored an insurance goal with 1:17 
left Tuesday night at the Forum to lead the Kings to a 4-2 victory that cut the 
Oilers' lead in the Smythe Division semifinals to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Game 6 is tonight here at Northlands Coliseum, where the Oilers are on a 14-0 
playoff winning streak. Gretzky was with the two-time defending NHL champions 
for 12 of those victories before being traded to the Kings last Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said after Game 4, that even though we were down 3-1 we felt that we 
played pretty well throughout the series," Gretzky said. "This hasn't been a 
series, for a first round, that's been dominated by one team by any means. 
</P>
<P>
"And as I say, we've got the hardest draw in the league. We're playing the 
defending champions. We're playing a real good team that plays well under 
pressure. After we lost Game 1 at home we knew we had to win one game up there. 
. . . Now it comes down it has to be Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
"The momentum has changed a little bit, but we've still got a tough game in 
their rink," said Gretzky, who assisted on goals Tuesday by Chris Kontos and 
Bernie Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
Before the playoffs started, Gretzky insisted Northlands Coliseum was the 
hardest rink in which to win. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were 2-2 here during the regular season, but the postseason brings a 
whole different atmosphere to the Oilers. Their last playoff loss here was to 
Philadelphia in the fifth game of the 1987 Stanley Cup finals. Edmonton won the 
seventh game at home, then went 11-0 last year en route to their fourth Cup in 
five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
They then kept the streak going with Grant Fuhr's 4-0 shutout last Saturday and 
a 4-3 victory Sunday on defenseman Steve Smith's goal with 26 seconds left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of ice they like to play on. It's fast ice," said Gretzky, who 
was booed here every time he touched the puck last weekend. "It may be the best 
ice in the league. They thrive on that ice. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to be patient and be smart. We're going to play our same game. 
You never know." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers have lost only seven of 52 home playoff games since 1984, when they 
won their first Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Kings goalie Kelly Hrudey, an Edmonton native, is eager to atone for last 
weekend's losses. 
</P>
<P>
When told about the Oilers' winning streak, he said: "That's good. Because then 
the odds are that they're bound to lose one eventually. I'm not hoping, I'm 
going to go there to try and make that happen. I don't want to go up there and 
let Lady Luck play a part of it. We have to do it ourselves, not wait for 
somebody. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't care who the pressure is on. It's only in your mind, and let's 
just worry about our own game," said Hrudey, who evened his playoff record at 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey rebounded with a strong game Tuesday night, making several great saves 
late in the second period and then shutting the door on the Oilers after 
allowing Normand Lacombe's backhander with 4:05 left that cut the Kings' lead 
to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kings coach Robbie Ftorek, who's usually noncommittal about everything, 
had something to say about the Oilers' playoff winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a first time," he said. "Some people would say the odds are 
against us but some would say the odds are for us. I say it's another game that 
we've just got to go up and play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that they don't want to come back here, but by the same token they're 
confident that they can win in this rink and we're confident that we can win in 
that rink. So both games are going to be real exciting," he said, obviously 
confident the Kings can force Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton coach Glen Sather wasn't disappointed in his team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't die. We didn't expect to win this series easily. We expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Then Sather, who got into a war of words with Gretzky before the playoffs, took 
a jab at another Oiler-turned-King, Marty McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that McSorley said they were going to win in five, so we've already 
disrupted his prediction," Sather said. "Marty's usually right in his long-term 
predictions."

WHILE MAGIC SITS, SUBS PUT AWAY SPURS, 107-100

SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Always eager to resume playing in the final minutes of a close game after a 
break on the bench, Magic Johnson tore off his sweatsuit and swiftly moved to 
midcourt to await insertion into the Laker lineup late in the fourth quarter 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
There he sat for slightly more than two minutes, waiting for a stoppage of 
play. But while Johnson stretched and squirmed at the scorer's table, the 
Lakers got along surprisingly well without him. 
</P>
<P>
They went from an 88-88 tie with the San Antonio Spurs with 5:44 left to a 
97-90 lead with 3:32 remaining, when Johnson finally entered the game after 
Coach Pat Riley called a timeout for just that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
By then, though, Johnson's role had changed from head of a Laker salvage 
operation to caretaker of a lead, which they did not squander in turning back 
the Spurs, 107-100, before 15,861 fans at the HemisFair Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It was killing me to sit there," Johnson said. "I was about to go tell (Riley) 
to call a timeout. Even the scorer guy said to me, 'You're never going to get 
in.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 2:12 of enforced idleness turned out to be quite important for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did that surge without Johnson help the Lakers retain their two-game 
lead over the second-place Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division with six games 
to play, it also gave the Laker reserves a measure of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a confidence builder when they can get a run like that without 
him," Riley said. "When Earvin goes out of the game, we tend to defer and wait 
until he comes back for our offense. But tonight, we got our offense off the 
defense. We had a lot of (fast) breaks and completed them." 
</P>
<P>
This late-season victory was important to the Lakers in order to hold off the 
streaking Suns, who have won five straight. As a bonus, however, Riley seems to 
have finally settled the issue of his substitution pattern off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Productive in recent games, and especially effective Wednesday night, the 
Lakers seemingly now have settled upon swingman Tony Campbell to go with sixth 
man Michael Cooper and backup center Mychal Thompson. Center Mark McNamara may 
play a few minutes, as he did Wednesday, but Orlando Woolridge appears in 
limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to continue with it," Riley said. "I like this rotation. I made the 
statement four games ago that I'd like to go with Tony more because we need the 
quickness and the defense. But I also want to get Mychal (Thompson) some more 
minutes. That's the way it's going to be, probably for the rest of the regular 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had 24 points and 10 rebounds when allowed to play, said he hopes 
Riley has settled on a substitution pattern for the sake of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Riley) was waiting to see what would work," Johnson said. "But I 
think it's all set now. I just hope we're set on something. We need to know 
because me, as the guy running the show, needs to know what plays to run if 
(Campbell) is in there or if (Woolridge) is in there." 
</P>
<P>
Laker reserves accounted for 19 points and seven rebounds Wednesday night, but 
the contributions on defense were immeasurable. Campbell, who played 22 
minutes, helped the Lakers initiate their running game. Thompson, whose 27 
minutes were four more than starter Kareem Abdul-Jabbar logged, had 12 points. 
And Cooper was tenacious as usual on defense and scored a three-point play to 
culminate that 9-2 run during Johnson's sit-in. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was waiting to replace Cooper when the Lakers' sixth man scored on a 
fastbreak layup and was fouled with 4:07 to play. With Johnson still sitting, 
Cooper made the free throw for a 97-90 Laker lead. The game went on, each team 
missing shots without a stoppage of play. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with 3:32 left, Spur Coach Larry Brown called a timeout. Johnson 
thought he was free at last to enter the game, but Brown cunningly changed it 
to a 20-second timeout, during which substitutions cannot be made. Johnson 
looked at Riley and shrugged his shoulders. Only then did Riley call a timeout, 
and Johnson finished out the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker starters still were the main contributors. A.C. Green had 17 points 
and 11 rebounds, while James Worthy also had 17 points. Abdul-Jabbar scored 14 
points, including two key baskets on sky hooks in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio has lost 14 of its last 16 games. The Spurs did not go down without 
a fight, though. Alvin Robertson led them with 22 points, while forwards Willie 
Anderson and Jay Vincent each had 21. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which had the option to televise Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's final 
regular-season game April 23 at the Forum, has chosen instead to air a game 
between Atlanta and Detroit. The Lakers said the game, originally scheduled to 
start at 12:30 p.m., might be changed to a night game so that it could be 
televised on the Prime Ticket network. Coach Pat Riley, for one, was surprised 
that CBS chose to skip Abdul-Jabbar's final regular-season game. "It's their 
loss," he said. "I'm sure they're thinking, 'We'll see him in the playoffs.' 
But they won't see him like they will in this game. . . . ..(But) Kareem's 
going to have a nice day whether CBS wanted to televise it or not." . . . In 
one of the briefest Abdul-Jabbar farewell ceremonies so far, the Spurs 
presented the Laker center with a portrait of himself and a check of $10,000 
that will go to charity. Abdul-Jabbar, acknowledging the fans' support of 
basketball in San Antonio, told the crowd: "I've gotten to know what Texas 
hospitality is all about. You let your feelings show."

OILERS ARE NOT UNBEATABLE IN EDMONTON, BUT KINGS WILL HAVE TO PROVE IT

It is not the habit of the Edmonton Oilers to lose playoff games at the 
Northlands Coliseum. They didn't do so last year and they haven't done so this 
year. In fact, they've won 14 straight on their home ice. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say the Oilers can't be beaten in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they've lost there before," Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Ftorek is going to have to find a way for them to be beaten again if 
the Kings are not to be ousted from the National Hockey League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are going into Game 6 of the Smythe Division semifinal playoff series 
trailing, three games to two. One more win by the Oilers and the Kings can go 
on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings keep harking back to the two games they won up here at the end of the 
regular season. Granted, those were not playoff games, but by winning them the 
Kings did remove the invincible tag from the defending Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one understands the confidence the Oilers have in their playoff 
streaks and the advantage they have on their home ice better than the players 
who once played there. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the best ice in the league," Wayne Gretzky said. "They thrive on 
that ice." 
</P>
<P>
Marty McSorley pointed out that the fans in the Forum are louder than the fans 
in Northlands Coliseum, but said there is an intensity and a seriousness about 
hockey at the Northlands that cannot be denied. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when the subject of fast, open ice was mentioned, McSorley thought for a 
minute, admitted that the Oilers are fast, then added: "We have a lot of speed 
on our team. We've scored more goals in the league this year than anyone. If 
they want to turn it up a notch, fine. We'll have a shootout. We have some guys 
who would be very happy to oblige." 
</P>
<P>
In playing the Oilers, it is Edmonton's patience and discipline that the Kings 
have to keep trying to match. These have not been high-scoring games. Said 
Gretzky: "We felt like we have played pretty well throughout the series. There 
hasn't been a dominant team." 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Kings came to town for a playoff game against the Oilers, 
their chartered plane left Los Angeles two hours after their game at the Forum 
and they did not get to their hotel here until 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
They lost on each of the next two nights. 
</P>
<P>
This time, after beating the Oilers in Game 5 at the Forum Tuesday night, the 
Kings were allowed to go home and get a good night's sleep, skate at their own 
practice rink the next morning, then catch a 1 p.m. charter that put them here 
early Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called that plan "a lot more reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek said that travel plans were changed because some of the players didn't 
like the all-night travel. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the columnists are wondering, in print, why Ftorek is the coach of 
the Kings and how long he will keep the position. 
</P>
<P>
His contract runs only through the end of this season, so the questions to 
owner Bruce McNall are whether he wants Ftorek back, whether Ftorek's future 
depends on the outcome of the playoffs, and when these things will be decided. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even talked about it," McNall said. "Robbie is busy with the 
playoffs right now, and we won't sit down and talk about it for a while. My 
plan is to take a couple of weeks after the season and evaluate all personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been decided at this point. I don't even know what Robbie wants to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli, the oldest of the Kings and the man with the most playoff 
experience gave the Kings a lift by starting at left wing on the first line the 
Kings sent out Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But he logged very little ice time after that. He was not 100% after losing a 
reported 14 pounds last week while in hospital trying to recover from 
complications of the flu, including respiratory problems and high fever. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had put Tonelli out there for the first faceoff to give the team a 
psychological boost, Ftorek said: "I would imagine, possibly." That meant, he 
explained, that his fellow coaches, Cap Raeder and Bryan Maxwell, seemed to 
think it would give the team a boost. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sound defensively and he knew he wasn't going to see a lot of ice time," 
Ftorek said. "But he's hungry." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Game 6 of the Kings' playoff series against the Oilers will be televised by 
Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570) at 6:35 p.m. tonight. . . . Chris 
Kontos, signed by the Kings as a free agent on March 7, leads the NHL in 
playoff goals with six. That ties the Kings' club record for goals in a playoff 
series set by Marcel Dionne in 1976 against Boston. . . . With his goal Tuesday 
night, Wayne Gretzky passed Maurice Richard to become the NHL's second-leading 
playoff goal scorer with 83. Mike Bossy is first with 85. . . . Oiler Coach 
Glen Sather was not predicting whether the series would go six games or seven 
after the Kings stayed alive in Game 5, but he did take a little jab at one of 
his former players, saying, "Marty McSorley said they'd win it in five. We've 
already disrupted his plans." 
</P>
<P>
If the series goes to a seventh game, the teams will meet at the Forum Saturday 
at 7:15 p.m., with the scheduled Lazers' game being switched to Sunday at 11:30 
a.m.

SCOTT OSTLER: HEAT WANTS TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When last the world looked in on the little corner of Miami known as Overtown, 
the place was smokin'. It was late January, the Super Bowl was packing up its 
tents and sweeping up its peanut shells, and in nearby Overtown the ashes and 
the anger hadn't completely cooled. 
</P>
<P>
The ghetto neighborhood almost burned down in riots that started about the same 
time as the Super Bowl Week festivities. A policeman shot a suspected criminal 
off a motorcycle, and Overtown (and Liberty City) rioted. 
</P>
<P>
The riots were terribly embarrassing to Miami, which was counting on the Super 
Bowl to wipe out the city's Miami Vice image. The riots were embarrassing to 
the NFL, and annoying. It's hard to make an occasion look properly grand and 
festive when it's playing against a backdrop of barbecued buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Lobster thermidor was promised; ghetto thermidor was served. 
</P>
<P>
The riots ran out of steam several days before the game, for which Pete Rozelle 
publicly gave thanks. "The one big plus," he said, "is that it's early in the 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly three months later, comes some good news from Overtown. The NBA's 
Miami Heat has announced plans to build a community center in that downtrodden 
corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
If Miami will donate a piece of land, the Heat will build the building and give 
it to Overtown. There will be a gym, locker rooms, weight rooms, boxing 
facilities, tennis courts, a swimming pool, classrooms and a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers from nearby colleges will be enlisted to help run the show. Heat 
players and other Miami pro athletes have promised to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
The rec center is not a knee-jerk reaction to the riots. The Miami Arena is on 
the edge of Overtown and the team's front office was acutely aware of 
neighborhood conditions long before SuperRiot week, when one of the Heat's 
games was called on account of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were planning this project more than a year ago," says team owner Lewis 
Schaffel. "I can't even remember where the initial notion came from. We were 
looking to build a facility to practice at when the Arena is not available. We 
came up with this idea, we felt we could do some good, help the quality of life 
in Overtown. We want to try to make it as first-class as we can, something the 
people can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Brooklyn, Schaffel and his good pal, Billy Cunningham, spent a 
lot of time at the local rec center. Cunningham went on to become a pro 
basketball star, the Kangaroo Kid, then a successful NBA coach, then a partner 
in the Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
"That community center in Brooklyn made a difference in my life, and in 
Billy's, so we know the impact something like this can have," Schaffel says. 
</P>
<P>
The weird thing about all this is that the Heat, which hasn't completed its 
first season, is the only pro franchise that I've ever heard of to do something 
this big for its neighbors. An irony of big-time sports is that the richest 
teams, attracting the wealthiest fans, often perform in the humblest areas of 
town. Their games are least accessable to the closest fans. Yankee Stadium, the 
L.A. Coliseum, to an extent the Forum and Dodger Stadium, are examples of this. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure a lot of team owners reach out into the communities in various ways -- 
donate money, sponsor clinics, fund scholarships. But the Heat is breaking new 
ground here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think professional sports teams can do more," Schaffel says, "they can make 
a difference. When our players were told of the idea, everyone felt good about 
it, they all agreed to donate time, they felt it was something special. It 
makes us feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Heat will find out why no other teams have done this kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
One or two local politicians have expressed reservations about the project. 
Maybe the city won't donate land for something that will bring in no tax 
revenue. Maybe it's not what the people of Overtown really want. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it will prove too costly, even for the box-office-boffo Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Heat will have to be renamed the Miami Naive. 
</P>
<P>
The rec center seems like a great idea, but as someone once said, "A great idea 
is an idea that works." 
</P>
<P>
Still, how can you fault a team that wants to do the opposite of what so many 
teams and players are perceived of as doing these days -- wallowing in greed 
and excess? 
</P>
<P>
"We can be more than just a basketball team," Schaffel says. 
</P>
<P>
If that's not a great idea, it's a great idea for a great idea.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CUBS ARE SAVED BY WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The standings in the National League East must be upside down. The Chicago Cubs 
are supposed to be battling the Philadelphia Phillies for last place, not 
first. 
</P>
<P>
The big difference in the Cubs, who improved their record to 6-2 with a 3-2 
victory over the St. Louis Cardinals under the lights Wednesday night at 
Chicago, is the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams came to the rescue of Paul Kilgus with two out in the ninth 
inning and recorded his fourth save in as many chances. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgus and Williams were obtained in the deal that sent Rafael Palmeiro and 
pitcher Jamie Moyer from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgus, who has one of the Cubs' defeats, held the Cardinals to six hits and 
was working on a shutout going into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
An error by shortstop Domingo Ramos put Vince Coleman on to open the inning. 
Two outs later, Tom Brunansky hit a home run, and Williams was summoned. He 
gave up a single to Tony Pena but struck out Jose Oquendo to end it. 
</P>
<P>
It was a disputed strikeout. Umpire Charlie Williams ruled that an inside pitch 
tipped Oquendo's bat. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hit nothing," Oquendo said. "If I'd tipped it, they would have heard 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't overpower anyone," said Kilgus, who started fast for the Rangers last 
year but wound up 12-15. "But I don't walk many and I'm always around the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who will play their first home game today, are now 2-4 and have 
lost another starting pitcher. Scott Terry, hit in the knee by a pitch, had to 
leave after three innings when the knee stiffened. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals got a strong four innings from young Chris Carpenter in a losing 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
" Both Kilgus and Williams have helped get us off to the fast start," Manager 
Don Zimmer said. "We didn't have anybody who get get a man out and save a game 
last season. It certainly appears we have one now." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, Montreal 3 -- The Phillies did not treat their former pal, 
Kevin Gross, very well as they improved their record to 6-2 and remained tied 
with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt, Von Hayes and Ron Jones all hit third-inning home runs, and the 
Phillies took a 5-0 lead. With Steve Bedrosian in the bullpen, that usually 
means victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who hit only six home runs last season, has four in just eight games 
this season. Schmidt hit his third of the year and the 545th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 3, Houston 1 -- The Dodgers thought that Paul O'Neill didn't hit 
against anyone but them. It isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill doubled to left-center field to drive in all of the Cincinnati runs in 
the ninth inning and give the Reds the victory at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rhoden and Larry Andersen held Cincinnati to five hits in eight innings as 
the Astros took a 1-0 lead. Bullpen ace Dave Smith took over in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
His luck was poor. Eric Davis singled and went to third on a two-base error by 
first baseman Glenn Davis. Todd Benzinger was given an intentional pass, and 
Juan Agosto came in to face O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to meet the ball and get a run in," O'Neill said. "I'm just 
glad it got through." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, San Diego 0 -- Tom Glavine held the heavy-hitting Padres to five 
hits at San Diego in his second complete-game victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In his other start, he held the Dodgers to four hits and an unearned run. Last 
season, he led the league in defeats with 17. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Perry had four of Atlanta's 12 hits, and Dale Murphy homered with a man 
aboard in the first inning. DAN HAFNER

HEWLETT-PACKARD TO BUY STRUGGLING APOLLO COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silicon Valley computer giant Hewlett-Packard said Wednesday that it has agreed 
to buy struggling Apollo Computer for $476.5 million in a deal that underscores 
the increasing competition in the fast-growing market for sophisticated 
computer workstations. 
</P>
<P>
If completed as scheduled later this year, the purchase will give H-P an 
estimated 30% of the $4.1-billion workstation market. But analysts said that 
Sun Microsystems, the current leader in the workstation business with a 28% 
market share, is likely to retain its No. 1 position on the strength of its new 
product line unveiled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Workstations are powerful desktop computers with sophisticated graphics 
displays that are typically used by engineers and scientists for highly 
technical tasks. In most cases, they look much like personal computers, 
although they occasionally have larger screens. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal for Apollo, H-P would pay $13.125 for each of the 
Chelmsford, Mass., company's 36.3 million shares. Apollo's stock shot up 
$4.625, or more than 50%, to close at $12.75 in heavy trading on the 
over-the-counter market. H-P stock slipped 75 cents to $53.50, possibly because 
of the immediate impact investors thought the deal would have on H-P's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Although small compared to some mergers in other industries, the Apollo deal 
would be one of the biggest in the computer business, where acquisitions of 
major companies have been relatively rare until recently. However, analysts 
said the computer industry may be ripe for a round of acquisitions of 
struggling companies too weak to withstand the growing competitive pressures 
among computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually these weaker companies just die," said Peter Rogers, a technology 
analyst with Robertson, Colman &amp; Stephens, a San Francisco brokerage. 
"What's new here is that one of these weaker companies was actually acquired by 
a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the proposed deal is a "win" for both sides. H-P will get the 
technological advances that Apollo has developed in computer graphics and its 
Unix operating system software. In addition, the Palo Alto company has an 
opportunity to broaden its product line and expand its East Coast manufacturing 
and sales operations. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo, analysts agreed, was saved from virtual collapse. "Apollo has had some 
good products, but not good management," said Jay Stevens of Dean Witter 
Reynolds, a New York brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Added Rogers: "Apollo was saved from itself. It was growing at one-third the 
industry rate and was having trouble staying profitable." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1980, Apollo moved quickly to become a leader in the fledgling 
workstation market. But it ran into difficulties as big computer makers, 
including H-P, and younger upstarts, particularly Sun Microsystems, moved 
aggressively onto its turf and overtook it. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo, No. 4 in the workstation market behind Sun, Digital Equipment Corp. and 
H-P, squeezed out a profit of $2.1 million last year on sales of $654 million. 
</P>
<P>
H-P, an industry pioneer founded in 1939, had sales of $9.8 billion last year 
from a broad range of computer products. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were not unanimously in favor of the deal. Apollo, which has been 
slashing prices to remain competitive, is viewed as a second-rate producer, 
said Salomon Bros.' Mona Eraiba, who was unenthusiastic about the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are better things to buy for $500 million," she said. However, she said 
H-P's size and strength means the acquisition carries very little financial 
risk. "They can afford to make mistakes," she said.

SENATE PANEL BACKS BUSH IN APPROVING S&amp;L RESCUE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee completed work late 
Wednesday on a savings and loan rescue plan that in most respects would impose 
the strict discipline the Bush Administration is seeking for the faltering 
thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
In a significant victory for President Bush, the committee voted, 11 to 10, to 
drop a proposal by Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) to fund the 
$50-billion cost of the industry bailout by including it in the 
deficit-burdened federal budget for the 1989 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The panel instead accepted an Administration proposal that would reflect the 
cost over a period of 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the showdown vote, three of the committee's 12 Democrats broke ranks to 
support the Administration plan, which was supported by eight of the panel's 
nine Republicans. Each of the three Democrats -- Alan Cranston of California, 
Alan J. Dixon of Illinois and James R. Sasser of Tennessee -- said they were 
swayed by Administration threats to veto the bill if its funding plan did not 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, meanwhile, a strong stand by the S&amp;L industry Tuesday 
persuaded lawmakers to dilute tough new capital requirements that the 
Administration considers to be the cornerstone of the bailout package. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate version, which has been worked out in bipartisan, closed-door 
meetings over the past few weeks, the new capital standards were fully accepted 
and even toughened in some respects. 
</P>
<P>
Those standards would require S&amp;Ls to increase capital to a level of 6% of 
assets by June, 1991, up from 3% now. The 6% standard is currently required of 
nationally regulated banks. 
</P>
<P>
There was no attempt by the Senate banking panel to dilute the requirement that 
a thrift's capital must consist of tangible capital, or real money, instead of 
accounting artifices such as good will and subordinated debt. 
</P>
<P>
A subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee 
Tuesday cut the ratio back to 3% and changed definitions so that intangible 
items such as good will could be counted toward half of the capital 
requirement. In effect, that meant that only 1.5% of assets would have to be 
tangible capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to Sign 
</P>
<P>
The panel later restored some of the tougher requirements proposed by the 
Administration, but Treasury officials continued to warn that the House was 
developing a bailout bill that the President would be unwilling to sign. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, however, earlier threats of a presidential veto over the bailout 
funding issue were muted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief letter to Riegle, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady praised the 
emerging Senate package as "on balance meritorious." He repeated the 
Administration view that the cost of the bailout should be put "off budget" to 
avoid increasing the deficit. Under the Administration plan, the cost would be 
absorbed over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The letter did not repeat the veto threat, but Riegle, Cranston and Sasser 
agreed separately that Brady was adamant the bill would be rejected by the 
President if it did not contain the 30-year funding plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and Sasser cited the mounting cost of delaying the S&amp;L bailout and 
said that the probability the Administration would force the legislation, in 
Cranston's words, "back to square one" was the main reason they voted for the 
Bush plan. 
</P>
<P>
White House assistant Richard C. Breeden praised Riegle's management of the 
Senate bill, declaring the intense Administration-Congress struggle to hammer 
out an acceptable compromise the most fruitful such exercise in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
In public statements, however, Riegle stuck to his guns on the funding issue. 
He declared that his plan would avoid the "accounting and budget gimmickry" of 
Bush's proposal by reducing the interest costs of financing the bailout through 
direct Treasury borrowing at a savings of $4.5 billion to taxpayers over the 
next three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, said he still has a 
"fundamental disagreement" over allowing the bailout costs to swell the federal 
deficit in apparent violation of the mandatory Gramm-Rudman law's budget 
reduction target. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Treasury Department consistently has disputed Riegle's 
projected savings, arguing that the higher deficit would force up interest 
rates that the government must pay on its debt, thereby wiping out most of the 
projected savings. 
</P>
<P>
Garn was joined by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) in offering a showdown amendment to 
strike out the Riegle funding proposal in the committee's draft bill and 
substitute instead the Administration's initial proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, the unwieldy 47-member subcommittee struggled through a list of 
hundreds of proposed amendments. During the day, the subcommittee: 
</P>
<P>
* Voted 27-16 to further allow S&amp;Ls to continue to invest in risky areas 
such as commercial real estate development, fast food franchises and junk bonds 
and count those investments as capital. The Senate version of the Bush proposal 
would phase out such practices over five years. The Bush plan would end the 
practice immediately. 
</P>
<P>
* Voted 26-18 to require thrifts to concentrate 80% of their lending on 
housing, up from the current requirement of 60%. But the amendment, by 
subcommittee Chairman Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), sets forth a broad definition of 
housing to include consumer, education and small business loans and provides 
that no S&amp;L failing to meet the 80% requirement could be penalized if its 
current mix of loans falls short of the requirement.

FAILED DEAL FURTHER OBSCURES EASTERN'S FUTURE 
</P>

<P>
The collapse of Peter V. Ueberroth's attempt to acquire Eastern Airlines means 
more than just a failed opportunity for the former baseball commissioner and 
Summer Olympics chief to work his magic again. 
</P>
<P>
It also means that Eastern's prospects for surviving and prospering become even 
cloudier. 
</P>
<P>
Reviving the battered carrier and making it profitable -- a goal that has 
eluded parent Texas Air Corp. and would have been daunting even for the 
confident Ueberroth -- is becoming increasingly difficult the longer the 
carrier remains mostly idled with only a fraction of its planes airborne, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The longer the airline stays mostly grounded, the more inroads that competitors 
such as American, Delta and USAir will continue to make into Eastern's prime 
markets. Meanwhile, Eastern's already poor public image, particularly among 
business travelers and travel agents, continues to worsen. And rearing its ugly 
head is the growing risk of an economic recession -- one that Eastern would 
have had trouble surviving even without its recent difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Eastern) have already lost market share, and it will be even that much 
more difficult several months down the road to get it back," says Daniel A. 
Hersh, analyst with the Los Angeles brokerage of Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the collapse of the Ueberroth deal, Eastern President Philip 
Bakes said Wednesday that the Miami-based airline's strategy now is to 
reorganize as a smaller carrier serving roughly 50% to 60% of its pre-strike 
schedule of 1,040 flights a day and employing some 15,000 to 18,000 people, 
compared to 31,000 before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The airline currently is operating about 110 flights a day, mostly in its 
Northeast shuttle and in Latin America, with about 210 of its 250 aircraft 
sitting idle. 
</P>
<P>
Such a scaled-down strategy can work if Eastern's management concentrates on 
its most profitable routes and sheds the rest, suggests George W. James, 
president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm based in Washington. In some 
markets, such as in Washington and New York, competition is limited because of 
controls on airport landing "slots." Eastern owns many of these valuable slots, 
which also can be sold, James notes. 
</P>
<P>
"They are an unprofitable large airline, but they might make it into a 
profitable small airline," he says. "But it's not assured." 
</P>
<P>
However, others expressed skepticism about how effectively Eastern under 
current management can pursue that strategy, which the airline has been trying 
to do anyway. Moreover, such a buildup process could take weeks when Eastern 
can't afford the time, some analysts and observers say. Some still believe that 
selling the airline is a more viable option for Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, making the carrier profitable again will be tough under any 
owner. Even with labor concessions worth about $210 million in annual savings 
-- which Eastern's key unions agreed to grant Ueberroth in exchange for a 30% 
ownership stake -- the airline would still lose money, based on its 1988 loss 
of $335.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the "hub-and-spoke" system used by major airlines requires offering a 
large number of connecting flights through the same hub airport to remain 
competitive. Smaller airlines generally have survived by concentrating on only 
a few markets and serving them well. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, some analysts say, the airline's days as a large, separately 
managed carrier are numbered. It may have to be acquired by another airline, 
such as Trans World Airlines and its corporate raider chairman, Carl C. Icahn. 
</P>
<P>
Or it could be bought by a non-airline investment group similar to Ueberroth's, 
whose goal may be merely to get Eastern into good enough financial shape so 
that it can be sold to another carrier, possibly in a year or two. Such 
troubled carriers as Republic and Western airlines were revived by turnaround 
artists, only to be sold to Northwest and Delta airlines, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Full Capacity 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to see Eastern surviving long term on its own, it simply doesn't 
have the market penetration compared to the mega-carriers," says Raymond E. 
Neidl, an analyst who follows Eastern for the New York bond research firm of 
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei. 
</P>
<P>
Any owner's first step toward that end would be to get Eastern's flights back 
up quickly. Time is of the essence because the longer Eastern operates with a 
limited schedule, the more inroads into its market share can be made by hungry 
competitors, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
That was a lesson learned hard by Braniff, which in its prime enjoyed a major 
share of its chief hub at Dallas-Ft. Worth. But by the time it resumed flights 
in 1984, months after shutting down and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection, rivals American and Delta had gained dominant shares of that key 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The building-up process could take weeks because some idled aircraft must be 
"de-pickled" -- taken out of short-term storage -- and moved from Miami hangars 
to other airports. Also, crew members who have scattered around the country 
must return to their bases. Some pilots and others may need to be recertified. 
Laid-off non-union workers must be called back, if available. Marketing 
programs, reservation systems, fare and flight schedules, in-flight services 
and fuel contracts and countless other details must be worked out before 
flights can resume on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
"When Braniff started flying again, it cost them a lot of money," notes Dick 
Warden, an analyst at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
But even if it can get most of its flights restored quickly, Eastern still 
faces another major challenge: erasing its chronic negative public image, 
fostered by years of poor service and bitter management-labor relations and 
aggravated by the recent machinists union strike and subsequent bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
Shedding that image is critical, analysts say, because to turn itself around 
Eastern must increase its popularity among business travelers -- those 
passengers willing to pay higher fares in exchange for better service and 
greater choices of flight times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooing Back Business People 
</P>
<P>
That is because union concessions won't entirely erase Eastern's losses, and 
other costs already have been cut to the bone by Texas Air, analysts say. The 
difference between profit and loss must come from increased revenues, largely 
from business passengers, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Getting more business travelers won't be easy because Eastern's most successful 
operation to attract business travelers has been its Eastern Shuttle. But Texas 
Air plans to sell the shuttle to New York real estate developer Donald J. Trump 
for $365 million. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's primarily north-south route system, from the Northeast to Florida, 
Latin America and the Caribbean, is tourist oriented. For that type of 
passenger, low fares are the major draw, and Eastern -- like many other 
carriers emerging after crippling strikes -- is bound to use bargain-basement 
pricing at the start to bring back travelers. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, boosting business travelers over the long run requires 
improved service -- an elusive goal for Eastern in the past because of poor 
labor relations and rock-bottom employee morale. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth was hoping that his plan to give employees 30% of Eastern's stock, 
making it the only major airline to give workers such a large ownership stake, 
would have caused morale to rise markedly. Another owner may try a similar 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really the wild card," Bateman Eichler's Hersh says. "They (Eastern 
employees) may be so happy to get back to work and be rid of Frank Lorenzo. 
Quite frankly, we may all underestimate the power of what they can produce." 
</P>
<P>
Any owner also can be expected to try a myriad of marketing programs to revive 
Eastern's popularity among business and vacation travelers. For example, he 
could add incentives to the firm's frequent-flier program. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern's chief competitors -- particularly American, Delta and USAir -- 
are also seeking more business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Those rivals already have increased flights on many of Eastern's key routes. 
American Airlines, for example, announced Friday that it would add 11 flights 
in Miami, boosting its total to 31, and make that city a hub. Continental 
Airlines, which enjoys inside knowledge of what Eastern routes are most 
lucrative through their shared parent, Texas Air, also has been adding 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Recession 
</P>
<P>
But even if it successfully fends off competitors and boosts business 
travelers, Eastern faces another potentially crippling threat over which it has 
no control: that of an economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
Unless new owners have deep pockets, they may not have the financial resources 
to stomach a sustained decline in passenger traffic likely to accompany a 
recession, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Also, once it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings, Eastern or a new owner will 
have to resume interest payments on some $3.8 billion of debt, bond analyst 
Neidl says.

THE SMITHKLINE BEECHAM DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DRUG FIRM WOULD BE WORLD'S 2ND LARGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after revealing that they were in negotiations, SmithKline Beckman 
Corp. and Beecham Group PLC announced Wednesday that they have agreed to merge, 
creating the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
The new British-based company, to be called SmithKline Beecham, would have 
worldwide sales of $6.7 billion in prescription and over-the-counter drugs and 
health-care products. Only Merck &amp; Co. of Rahway, N.J., is larger. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the merger, Philadelphia-based SmithKline would spin off two 
profitable Orange County subsidiaries, Beckman Instruments in Fullerton and 
Allergan Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company said Beckman, a maker of medical and diagnostic equipment, 
and Allergan, a maker of eye and skin care products, would not fit into the 
merged company's focus on pharmaceutical products. The new firm would keep its 
SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories subsidiary, which operates a chain of 
clinical labs, including a large facility in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The SmithKline-Beecham combination would operate more effectively in "an 
increasingly competitive and truly worldwide marketplace" for their products, 
the chairmen of the two companies said in prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
The merger would open the U.S. and Japanese markets, two of SmithKline's 
strengths, for Beecham. It also would give Beecham access to SmithKline's 
worldwide marketing expertise and create a 6,000-member sales force, with 
nearly a third of that in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline would benefit from the Beecham presence in Europe, which is rapidly 
evolving into one market as the 12 Common Market nations prepare to remove 
economic restrictions in 1992. SmithKline, suffering from the faltering sales 
of its primary product, the anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also would gain from 
several of Beecham's promising new prescription drugs, including Eminase, a 
drug to quickly dissolve blood clots in arteries. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline is the world's fifth-largest pharmaceutical company, while Beecham 
is the 19th largest. 
</P>
<P>
With products such as Tums, Sucrets and N'Ice, Beecham has a strong market in 
over-the-counter drugs, and the merged company would rank No. 2 in such sales. 
The combination also would create the world's fourth-largest firm in animal 
health products. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal, which must be approved by regulators in both countries and 
by shareholders of both firms, would be close to a merger of equals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, current shareholders in SmithKline 
would receive half of the stock in the new company, and shareholders in 
London-based Beecham would get the other half. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, holders of SmithKline's 133 million shares also would receive a 
one-time cash dividend of $5.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline's chairman and chief executive, Henry Wendt, would become chairman 
of the new firm, and Beecham's executive chairman, Robert Bauman, would become 
chief executive. An equal number of directors would be appointed by each 
company to a new 18-member board, and board meetings would alternate between 
London and Philadelphia, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the pharmaceutical operations, which would represent about 51% of the 
new firm's revenues, would be John Chappell, currently president of Smith Kline 
&amp; French Laboratories. James Andress, a Beecham executive, would head the 
new firm's health products and services operations. 
</P>
<P>
But the company would be created under British law and based in London, and its 
shares sold on the London Stock Exchange. American depository shares, 
representing ownership in the new firm, would be traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diffuse Market 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that the power axis has shifted," said David H. MacCallum, an 
industry analyst at the investment firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"This is perhaps a merger of equal equity interests in terms of share holdings, 
but the power structure has moved from Philadelphia to London," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have mixed views about how well off the combined company would be as 
it competes in a diffuse market in which no firm has more than a 10% share of 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is a "good one" for both companies because they have strengths in 
different areas, said Kent Blair, an industry analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin 
&amp; Jenrette Securities in New York. But MacCallum said the bigger size won't 
necessarily mean better results. 
</P>
<P>
News of the definitive agreement made SmithKline Beckman's stock the volume 
leader on the New York Stock Exchange as nearly 4.7 million shares traded hands 
on Wednesday, closing at $62.75 a share, down $2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The merger, MacCallum said, "doesn't really fix the basic problem in both 
companies." That problem, more evident at SmithKline, he said, is that "the 
research pipeline is simply not producing a sufficient flow of product to 
replace some of the products that are getting tired." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Tagamet, which was developed in the mid-1970s, have slumped as 
competitors developed anti-ulcer drugs in the early 1980s. The company's 
profits fell 60% to $229.2 million last year from $570.1 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The bet in SmithKline is that the payoff in research is just around the 
corner, but that corner keeps getting farther away," MacCallum said. He also 
said he wasn't impressed by the prescription drugs that Beecham is developing. 
</P>
<P>
Blair agreed that there was "some truth to the belief that there is little in 
the pipeline," but he said the combined research and development operations 
should help the new firm come up with more products. 
</P>
<P>
Beecham spokeswoman Joanne Lawrence pointed out that the combined firm would 
spend $500 million a year on research and development. She said that Beecham 
has several drugs ready to be marketed now and in the next few years and that 
SmithKline is working on drugs that should be available later in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Since last fall, SmithKline has been under pressure to improve its financial 
results. In November, it spun off 16% of Beckman Instruments by selling stock 
to the public as part of an effort to shore up the corporation's declining 
profit and shaky reputation on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, SmithKline's president, George W. Ebright, surprised Wall 
Street by resigning. Two other top SmithKline executives resigned late last 
year. And the company's stock price fell well below analysts' estimates of its 
breakup value, touching off rumors that another drug company might mount a 
hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value in Allergan 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Beecham was rumored to be interested in SmithKline and, it was 
revealed later, executives of both firms had discussed a possible merger. 
SmithKline confirmed earlier this month that it was negotiating a possible 
merger with Beecham. 
</P>
<P>
MacCallum believes that the real value in the proposed merger is the spinoff of 
the two Orange County firms, especially Allergan, "which is a jewel of a 
company."

Savings Bonds Sales Higher: Sales of U.S. savings bonds increased 3.2% in March 
to $713 million, the Treasury Department reported. Sales for the first six 
months of fiscal 1989, which began last October, totaled $4.02 billion, up 9.5% 
from the comparable period a year earlier. Effective last Nov. 1 through April 
30, bonds held five years or longer earn at an annual rate of 7.35% for the six 
months, up from 6.9% during the previous six months. On May 1, a new rate will 
take effect based on open market interest rates.

GPA Group Ltd., one of the world's largest aircraft leasing companies, said

<P>
The planes will include wide-bodied and narrow-bodied planes and engines and 
will be the largest order ever, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the order and the companies lined up to lease the aircraft will be 
announced next Tuesday in London, Paris and New York, King said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Beat Delta Order 
</P>
<P>
The order includes engines supplied by Rolls-Royce PLC, Pratt &amp; Whitney, 
Britain's General Electric Co., and CFMI, a joint venture of General Electric 
and SNECMA of France. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes and would be worth 
almost $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about these figures, King said: "While I cannot confirm a precise number 
to you, the suggestion is substantially correct. It's in the region of 200 
aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that a figure somewhere between $11 billion and $20 billion would 
be nearer the total value of the order. 
</P>
<P>
The largest previous order was by Delta Air Lines last September for 225 Boeing 
and McDonnell Douglas planes worth $10.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
GPA was set up 14 years ago by Irish entrepreneur Tony Ryan in an inconspicuous 
four-story building on the perimeter of Shannon airport in western Ireland. 
Ryan has an 8% stake of GPA valued at over $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, whose owners include Air Canada, Prudential Insurance of Britain and 
the Mitsubishi Group of Japan, already has 350 new aircraft on order. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said the deal would leave the company three times larger than its nearest 
competitors in the aircraft leasing field. 
</P>
<P>
Leasing concerns are accounting for an increasing share of the world's aircraft 
orders, as airlines have relied more on leasing to give greater flexibility in 
their fast-changing business. Through the leasing route, airline companies fill 
short-term needs without costly investments in planes. About 20% of the world's 
airline fleet is now leased. 
</P>
<P>
The Engineer magazine reported that Rolls-Royce will supply engines for 50 
Boeing 757s likely to be involved in the order. 
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace will make the wings for the Airbus A330s and A320s, which may 
also be fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, the magazine said. GPA has already 
ordered 40 A320s.

S&amp;P to Monitor NWA Debt: Standard &amp; Poor's has placed $208 million of 
NWA Inc. debt on its credit watch surveillance list with negative implications. 
The rating agency said it was likely that NWA would take on more debt or sell 
assets if acquired by oilman Marvin Davis. Davis has offered to buy NWA, the 
parent of Northwest Airlines, for $2.7 billion.

J. P. MORGAN PROFIT DROPS 36%; HIGHER INTEREST RATES BLAMED

<P>
J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. became the first big U.S. money center bank to announce 
first-quarter earnings Wednesday when it reported a 36% drop in profit due to 
rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
It said earnings in the first quarter fell to $180 million from $281 million in 
the year-earlier quarter, which contained a $43-million tax refund. 
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates have risen significantly over the past 12 months, and recently 
the yield curves in the United States and other markets have either flattened 
or inverted, limiting the opportunities for profitable repositioning of 
interest rate exposures," the company said. J. P. Morgan said these 
circumstances were also unfavorable for trading and other income-earning 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Morgan, which owns Morgan Guaranty Bank, also expects to receive 
permission to underwrite and deal in corporate debt soon, President Dennis 
Weatherstone told shareholders at the annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We shortly expect to have final authority to underwrite and deal in corporate 
debt in this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have been excluded from participating in securities 
underwriting activities in the United States since the 1930s. However the 
Federal Reserve Board this year allowed commercial banks to underwrite and deal 
in commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

BOESKY ASKS JUDGE TO END PRISON TERM 
</P>

<P>
Ivan F. Boesky has asked a federal judge to end his three-year prison term but 
prosecutors Wednesday refused to take a stand on releasing the former 
speculator at the center of Wall Street's insider trading scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, who has already served one year in prison, claimed that his help led to 
a record plea bargain deal by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the subsequent 
indictment of its "junk bond" financier Michael Milken and others on 
racketeering and securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky's lawyers Tuesday asked U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker to reduce 
his sentence to time already served, which would allow his speedy release. 
</P>
<P>
"The true fruits of Ivan Boesky's unsurpassed cooperation with the government 
are now -- for the first time -- dramatically, fully and publicly known," the 
court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
The court documents claimed that Boesky was "to a significant extent a follower 
in a larger criminal conspiracy organized and operated" by Drexel and its 
high-yield bond department headed by Milken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Position' 
</P>
<P>
The 98-count indictment of Milken, handed down March 29, alleged that the 
Drexel bond trader illegally schemed with Boesky to defraud clients and the 
investing public by manipulating stock prices and skirting federal securities 
laws during attempted takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Lasker, who sentenced Boesky in December, 1987, the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Manhattan said "the government takes no position" on 
Boesky's move, but acknowledged his cooperation in the almost three-year probe 
into Wall Street corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jess Fardella, writing on behalf of U.S. Atty. Benito 
Romano, noted that "the fruits of his cooperation are now more vividly apparent 
to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Fardella described the Milken indictment and the $650-million tentative 
settlement of criminal charges Drexel reached with the government as "the 
centerpiece of Boesky's cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
The letter continued: "Boesky's disclosures were the essential catalyst for all 
that has been and remains to be revealed in those cases. Other investigations 
arising directly from Boesky's disclosures have also matured since Boesky's 
sentencing." 
</P>
<P>
But it added that "the government nevertheless articulated the value of that 
cooperation in unqualified terms when Boesky was sentenced." 
</P>
<P>
Boesky attorney Leon Silverman said: "I will have no comment while it's under 
consideration by the court." 
</P>
<P>
Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potential takeover targets, 
Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count as part of his plea bargain. Boesky, 
52, also agreed to pay a then-record $100 million to settle civil insider 
trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
On April 15, 1988, Boesky filed papers seeking a sentence reduction but asked 
Lasker to defer action. Attorneys again deferred the request in October and 
said last week that they planned to seek his release following Milken's 
long-awaited indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers on Tuesday said "public 'blood lust' " at the time of sentencing 
could not be countered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working as an Orderly 
</P>
<P>
"As the court recognized at sentencing, it was impossible for the public or the 
press to understand the incalculable value of Mr. Boesky's cooperation because 
the secrecy of the grand jury process precluded any public recitation of the 
value of the information that he had provided to the government," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky was eligible for parole March 21, two days before his one-year 
anniversary inside the minimum security prison camp in Lompoc, Calif., where 
the one-time corporate titan is working as an orderly. Boesky has supplied 
information used in more than a dozen cases in the United States and Britain. 
In exchange, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to 
lie to the SEC. His earliest non-parole release date is April 4, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of sentencing, prosecutors said Boesky's three-year term "was an 
appropriate sentence in light of all the competing factors." 
</P>
<P>
They also said that while Boesky provided a "window on the rampant criminal 
conduct" in the securities industry he also "engaged in serious and widespread 
criminal conduct."

Stocks rose again Wednesday in a session marked by takeover deals and mild 
optimism about the outlook for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.07 to 2,319.65, adding to its 
9.71-point gain on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 818 up, 618 down and 542 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were looking ahead to Friday's flood of economic reports, including 
widely watched ones on wholesale prices, merchandise trade, industrial 
production and factory use. 
</P>
<P>
Any indication of a slowdown would ease fears of inflation and thus take 
pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a way of cooling 
off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Healthy Fashion' 
</P>
<P>
High interest rates have siphoned money from stocks into the credit market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awfully hard to compete with 10% CDs and 9.5% Treasuries," said Richard 
Wholey, a broker-analyst at Wayne Hummer &amp; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market was basically flat Wednesday as traders awaited the economic 
reports, but stocks edged higher, continuing a gradual and uneven upward trend. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year the Dow index has risen just under 7%. 
</P>
<P>
"This is building in a very gradual and, I think, a healthy fashion. There has 
been no explosion of euphoria. Good, solid base-building is what appears to be 
going on," said Peter Barry, research director at Fahnestock &amp; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange was the second highest in 
what has been a quiet month on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.20 million shares, up from 
146.83 million in the previous session. That was just below the volume of 
165.88 million last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
195.46 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
On the deal-making front, SmithKline Beckman announced an agreement to merge 
with Britain's Beecham Group. SmithKline's stock was the most actively traded 
NYSE issue, falling 2 to 62 3/4 on volume of more than 4.6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard said it agreed to buy Apollo Computer, a workstation maker, for 
$13.125 a share or $476 million. Apollo jumped more than 50% in price in heavy 
over-the-counter trading of 10 million shares, rising 4 5/8 to 12 3/4. 
Hewlett-Packard fell 3/4 to 53 1/2 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actively traded stocks, Exxon rose 1/4 to 42, American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 31 1/4, Storage Technology was unchanged at 1 
7/8 and Greyhound rose 1/8 to 33 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,957.920, up 5.453. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.24 to 167.82. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.71 to 344.95, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index rose 0.50 to 298.99. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 2.14 to 415.68. 
At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 334.23, up 
1.09. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks ended mixed as political uncertainty spoiled an early rally 
attempt that brought the market into record territory. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices started at a record high, fell into the minus side in the 
afternoon and then rebounded near the close, brokers said. Activity was 
moderate. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index finished up 6.87 points at 33,256.45, after 
ending 250.56 points higher Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shares prices in London ended mixed after an early surge that followed details 
of the proposed Beecham-SmithKline merger. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 
index of 100 blue chips ended 1.7 points higher at 2,033.

The Japan Electrical Manufacturers' Assn. said the report was based on a survey

Government and corporate bond prices finished little changed to slightly lower 
in sluggish dealings Wednesday as traders awaited the scheduled release later 
this week of more economic data. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue slipped 1/16 point, or 63 cents for 
every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, 
rose to 9.10% from 9.09% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal prices edged up, however. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said government bond traders appeared to be holding back in 
anticipation of the slew of upcoming economic data, with the release of March 
retail sales figures due today followed a day later by new statistics on the 
U.S. trade deficit, producer prices and industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been unusually quiet for the course of this entire week," said Steven 
A. Wood, economist for BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco. 
"Everybody is looking for this data to give some kind of confirmation about the 
state of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
He said the most significant number may be the producer price index, which is 
viewed as a gauge of inflationary pressures. After back-to-back rises of 1% in 
January and February, Wood is looking for a 0.6% increase for March. 
</P>
<P>
A higher figure, he said, could prompt the Federal Reserve to boost interest 
rates in a bid to choke off inflation. Both rising interest rates and inflation 
lower the value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $7 billion in seven-year notes at the highest 
level at that type of auction in 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield was 9.39%, up from 9.30% at the last auction Jan. 11 and the 
highest since seven-year notes averaged 9.75% on Oct. 30, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term notes were 
unchanged, intermediate notes were down 1/16 point and long-term issues fell as 
much as 3/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial reporting service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 0.44 to 1,121.39. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, prices were steady. Moody's investment grade corporate 
bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, held firm at 299.59. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds rose 1/32 point to 90 23/32. The average yield to maturity slipped to 
7.73% from 7.74% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.99%, while the discount rose 3 
basis points to 8.68%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 9.29% as the discount 
rose 1 basis point to 8.77%. Yields on one-year bills held steady at 9.48% as 
the discount remained at 8.74%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
trading at 9 13/16%, up from 9.75% late Tuesday.

A student with long lank curls walked up the aisle of Crowder Hall at the 
University of Arizona and described to his girlfriend Japan's Kazuhito 
Yamashita, who was playing here as part of a national tour that brings him to 
UCLA's Royce Hall Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He burns!" 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was typical of the buzz that met the first half of Yamashita's 
classical guitar concert, in which he had played pieces by Fernando Sor, Johann 
Sebastian Bach and Benjamin Britten. They had seen a rapturous musician swoon 
over the guitar, his face occasionally buried in the crux of the neck and 
soundboard, rising off his stool as if the guitar were levitating. 
</P>
<P>
Most guitarists sit with the neck at the 2 o'clock position and simply watch 
what they're doing. Yamashita hangs on as though the currents of the music are 
taking him for a barely manageable ride through ecstasy, pain, troubled 
deliberation, and deliverance into the high sky of an unimaginable peace. 
</P>
<P>
"He's original, audacious. He always gets a response," said Tom Patterson, who 
heads the university's guitar department. 
</P>
<P>
They hadn't even heard what was to come, a complete, prodigious rendition of 
Dvorak's "New World" Symphony that took up the second half of the concert and 
left everyone shaking their heads. To haul the immense architectural edifice of 
an entire symphony with all its roots and rivulets out of that single soundhole 
-- one isn't supposed to do this sort of thing on the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
That's Yamashita. At 28, he has recorded 40 albums here and in Japan, including 
an "Italian Serenade" with flutist James Galway, an album called "Music of 
Spain" (he records in the United States on RCA Victor Red Seal), and a 
duo-guitar disc of works by Rimsky-Korsakov, Debussy and Francaix with his 
younger sister, Naoko (he has also played in concert with jazz guitarist Larry 
Coryell). 
</P>
<P>
But it was at the age of 19, in 1980, that he served notice with his 
individually arranged solo rendition of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an 
Exhibition." It was such a fiery and wholly unexpected tour de force that the 
guitar world greeted it much the same way Formula One circuit drivers peered at 
the first Ferrari tooling into their midst -- with total astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
This from a young man who took all of 20 minutes' instruction from Andres 
Segovia, a few more hours with Narciso Ypes, Jose Thomas and Japanese 
instructor Kohjiro Kobune, and the rest from his father, a self-taught guitar 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing about the offstage Yamashita to suggest the extravagance that 
comes out in his playing. He is trim, somewhat less than medium height with an 
inverted bowl of fine black hair, and graced with the politesse of someone who 
might be part of a diplomatic corps as well as a concert artist's world; that 
is, he is delicate without seeming over-ethereal. 
</P>
<P>
On the plane to Los Angeles he struggled through difficult English to explain 
that his father had been a shipyard engineer for Mitsubishi before he gave it 
up to found a guitar academy in Nagasaki, where Kazuhito was born, and it was 
for his father and friends that he first concertized. 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita didn't squawk when the stewardess made him put his classical Ramirez 
in the overhead bin, even though he had paid for an extra seat for his guitar. 
After the adjustment was made, he explained how he began entering Japanese 
competitions at the age of 10, and took first place in an all-Japan competition 
at 15. 
</P>
<P>
1977 was his big year. He took first prize in Spain's Ramirez competition in 
August, the Allessandro International Guitar Contest in Italy in September, and 
the Paris International Guitar Competition in October. He returned to Japan to 
find himself famous. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of musicians he admired. Julian Bream: "Very dreamy, very 
fantastical." He asked questions. But soon the effort to converse in English 
tired him. He took out some sheet music and began transcribing Bach's Sonata 
No. 6 for Unaccompanied Violin, which he will record later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The next day in Los Angeles he had the aid of a translator, UCLA 
ethnomusicologist Yoshiko Okazaki, and in his hotel room he talked more of his 
life and music. "Two things brought me to the guitar," he said. "From my first 
consciousness I heard guitar music at home with my father, Tohoru Yamashita, 
and his friends. To me, it wasn't human not to play the guitar. Then, I heard 
'Romanza.' It was so beautiful, I wanted to possess it by playing it. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school I was only an average student. I used the homework time for 
practice -- I didn't believe in homework anyway. I could have chosen other 
occupations, but the guitar was always such a part of me. People's expectations 
made me want to pursue and experience art. I never used any books on 
methodology. When I wanted to learn something I listened, and if I had trouble 
I asked my father. He's not a good performer, but he's a good teacher. Even now 
I'm learning from him." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita is far from the only Japanese musician to take up a Western idiom 
(postwar Japan has had a keen thirst for jazz and pop as well as classical 
artists). Asked why this portion of the East so often looks West, he replied: 
"We are a very adaptable people. From olden times we brought in Chinese music. 
When we heard Western music, we adapted to that. We have sympathetic feelings 
for other cultures and like to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of how he came by his extraordinary arrangement for "Pictures at an 
Exhibition," which he created in almost total secrecy and only recorded after 
the urging of friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to be able to play whatever came to my ear, whether it was 
classical music, or a TV or movie score. I never believed in the separation of 
music, saying, 'This should be for the piano, or this for the orchestra.' I 
always respond to melody, but with 'Pictures' I wanted to play the whole piece. 
The guitar has enormous possibilities for color and tone and symphonic 
expression. I also wanted to play a longer piece -- to do one piece that lasted 
40 minutes. That's a challenge. When I'm playing I'm in another dimension, 
where I'm so attracted to a piece that it feels like traveling. At the end I 
feel I've arrived where I began." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita has ambitions about his future that far transcend the normal hope of 
a concert artist. "Our scientific and economic development is such that I hope 
I can help through music to integrate spirituality into our way of life," he 
said. "The faith of art and music is very important in this age and for the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Where once it was simply the name of a place, the word Nagasaki is now a 
metaphor for one of the horrors of modern life. Has growing up there made him 
mindful of his home as a terminus of nuclear incineration, a symbol of militant 
contemporary paranoia? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel anything particularly about the past," he replied. "But maybe, 
subconsciously, there might be something. The hope for peace in Nagasaki is 
very strong. It's a beautiful city, more like a country place. I know that if I 
lived in Tokyo, I'd only see the separate sides of things. If I stay in the 
country, I can see the world move."

CRITIC AT LARGE: A 20-YEAR 'THREEPENNY OPERA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In more ways than one, the persistence of vision is what makes movies work. A 
trick of the eye makes a fast succession of still pictures seem to move. A 
persistent vision gets movies made, even if the planning and the peddling takes 
years. "The Last Temptation of Christ" was a dream of Martin Scorsese's for a 
decade or more, before his persistence paid off. Similar tales are part of 
Hollywood legend. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Chase, a producer not widely known outside industry circles, has had a 
persistent and probably obsessive feeling about the Kurt Weill-Bertolt Brecht 
"The Threepenny Opera" since he first heard the original 1928 version on 78 
r.p.m. Telefunken records, when he was an undergraduate at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, Chase, in partnership with director Carmen Capalbo, produced a new 
version, with the Kurt Weill songs and new lyrics and libretto by Marc 
Blitzstein, at the Off-Broadway Theatre de Lys. 
</P>
<P>
Weill's widow, Lotte Lenya, who had also been in the 1928 version when it was 
called "Die Dreigroschenoper," sang the part of Jenny again. Also in the cast 
were some other names that would be better known in time: Charlotte Rae, Bea 
Arthur and John Astin. 
</P>
<P>
Mounting the production, Chase said nostalgically during a recent interview, 
cost $8,897. By the time it closed seven years later, after many adventures, it 
had played 2,611 performances, longer than "South Pacific" or "Oklahoma!" More 
than 700 actors had played its 22 roles, including Valerie Bettis, Jerry 
Orbach, Paula Stewart, Pert Kelton, Georgia Brown, Ed Asner, Estelle Parsons, 
Leonard Nimoy and Carroll O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time business started to slow down, something would happen," Chase said. 
"First it was Louis Armstrong's recording of 'Mac the Knife' (the show's big 
hit), then Bobby Darin's, then Ella Fitzgerald's. It made the charts three 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Chase always thought "The Threepenny Opera" would make a movie, too. Or make a 
movie again. The great German director G. W. Pabst had made simultaneous 
French- and German-language versions of "Die Dreigroschenoper" in 1931. 
Unfortunately, Chase couldn't immediately acquire the film rights, and another 
German version was made in 1964, with Curt Jurgens and Hildegarde Neff. It was, 
in Chase's view, an embarrassment. When the rights became available in 1970, he 
grabbed them. The persistence of vision is not to be trifled with; getting the 
movie made took nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The musical had been Chase's first venture as a producer. He has since done 
some movies, including "The Hell With Heroes" and "Colossus: The Forbin 
Project," several plays, among them Graham Greene's "The Potting Shed," William 
Saroyan's "The Cave Dwellers" and a revival of Eugene O'Neill's "A Moon for the 
Misbegotten," and several television specials, one of them a biography of Grace 
Kelly starring Cheryl Ladd. 
</P>
<P>
After a good deal of shopping around, Chase found a somewhat improbably ally: 
Menahem Golan, co-founder of Cannon Films, which was even then in deepening 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Menahem," Chase said, "had directed theater in Israel before he got into 
producing, and it turned out that he'd always loved 'Threepenny Opera.' I'd had 
several versions of the film script and none of them worked. He understood the 
property and he wrote the script and directed it." 
</P>
<P>
The film, now in post-production, has Raul Julia as Macheath, Julie Walters 
(from "Educating Rita") as Mrs. Peachum, Roger Daltrey as the Street Singer and 
Lotte Lenya herself as Polly. 
</P>
<P>
Chase says he is pleased with the film and hopes it will be shown at the Cannes 
Film Festival. It is being called "Mac the Knife," to capitalize on the song's 
popularity, and Pathe, which bought out Cannon, is distributing it. 
</P>
<P>
The original vehicle was John Gay's "The Beggar's Opera," a ballad-opera first 
produced in 1728 and suggested to Gay, Chase believes, by Jonathan Swift, as an 
attempt to discredit then-Prime Minister Robert Walpole. 
</P>
<P>
Its sharp satire -- the murderous Macheath reprieved from hanging and given a 
medal -- was intended to mirror a decadent society. The Weill-Brecht "Die 
Dreigroschenoper" was timed to the 200th anniversary of "Beggar's Opera" and 
inspired by a magazine article about Gay's work. The musical's point of view 
seemed well-attuned to the waning days of the Weimar Republic. 
</P>
<P>
The later version prepared by Blitzstein had its debut as a concert performance 
conducted by Leonard Bernstein at Brandeis University in 1952, where Chase saw 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Weill had died in 1950 at the age of 50," Chase said. "My partner and I went 
to see Marc Blitzstein. Lenya was visiting him. They were planning a production 
for 1953 with Billy Rose. It didn't happen, and Lenya trusted us with the 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
It looks to be quite a year for the Weill-Brecht legacy, said Chase. Jerome 
Hellman is producing a new Broadway version of the musical, starring Sting and 
directed by John Dexter, for November. Donald Spoto is writing a biography, 
"Lenya: A Life," and there are plans for a Tri-Star film of Lenya's life, 
starring Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
It is enough to give persistence a good name.

JONES ON JAMAICAN COKE BUST: 'SOMEONE PUT IT THERE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grace Jones, who spent three days in a Jamaican jail on suspicion of cocaine 
possession, is determined to turn adversity into advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Released on $2,700 bail Tuesday, Jones, 36, has decided to return to the 
Kingston jail in which she languished this weekend to film videos for two cuts 
on her upcoming album, tentatively titled "On My Way," which is due out in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
She also made good use of her time in jail, writing six songs for a future 
album and completing a storyboard for a video, she said good-naturedly in a 
telephone interview from her home in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant singer-actress and her husband of 15 months, Chris Stanley, had 
gone there to scout video locations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Something strange always happens to me when I come to Jamaica," said Jones, a 
native of Jamaica who moved to New York when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, police searched the couple's house -- which includes their Music 
Mountain Recording Studio -- in the Kingston suburb of Stony Hill, confiscated 
.006 ounces of cocaine and arrested her. 
</P>
<P>
The often-outrageous Jones grew serious when discussing the drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about this and oh, it looks so bad," she said. "The way it comes over 
the radio, it's like you're guilty before you're even tried. But I just hold my 
head up high because I know inside me that I am innocent and it will be 
proven." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the cocaine, which police found wrapped in two Jamaican $2 bills 
and stuffed inside her purse, was planted there by someone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definite third party involvement," she said several times during the 
interview. "This will be proven in court. Someone put it there." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that the identity of the person will be revealed during her trial, 
which is scheduled to start June 6 in Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the charge of cocaine possession, she would probably be fined 
rather than sentenced to more jail time because of the small quantity of drugs 
involved, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a song on her new album is titled "Crack Attack" and warns against 
the perils of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of her exotic and trend-setting image, Jones emphasized that she has 
long denounced the use of drugs: "I was never an abuser. I've seen what it's 
done to other people, and that's enough to frighten me. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even smoke pot. I have a drink and that's about it. I like tequila. 
When I want to binge, I'll just go to tequila." 
</P>
<P>
She has already informed jail officials of her plans to film the videos for 
"Crack Attack" and "Kicked Around" at their facility. 
</P>
<P>
What was their reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"They sounded delighted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The "Kicked Around" lyrics were particularly evocative of the way Jones felt 
during her stay behind bars: 
</P>
<P>
 I've been kicked around 
</P>
<P>
 I've been bounced around 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought that I could fall 
</P>
<P>
 Thought I was standing tall 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that I'm the ball and I've been kicked around. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she regarded her jail time as "quite an experience," she laughed when 
she considered the misfortunes that so often befall her when she visits 
Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of my Jamaican saga," said Jones, who spends most of the year in New 
York or Los Angeles. "But I refuse to stop coming." 
</P>
<P>
She colorfully recounted those earlier episodes in the saga: She was robbed in 
the middle of eating dinner. She was run over by a speedboat. She was stranded 
on a reef while sailing. She was thrown off an American Airlines flight because 
she refused to check some master recording tapes through the luggage carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said she thought about never going back to Jamaica, but consulted a 
fortuneteller a couple years ago who told her she should go back "and face it 
positively." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, she returned to Jamaica for the funeral of a family member 
and met her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Given her propensity to find the bright moment among the bleak ones, she said 
she expects that something positive will come out of her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "I don't know what it is yet, but I will know it when it happens."

BUSINESS CHANNEL MARKS BIG-TIME CABLE DEBUT FOR NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. LEE, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 6 a.m. (EDT) Monday, CNBC, the nation's newest cable network and NBC's 
biggest-ever push into cable, will start its 24-hour-a-day service with "World 
Business," a lot of hope and only three well-known names. 
</P>
<P>
CNBC -- the initials stand for Consumer News and Business Channel -- says it's 
starting up with 13 million homes, or 26.3% of the nation's cable-equipped 
homes, able to receive its programming. A rival claims the actual figure is 
only 6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The "name" anchors it will have on launch day are a mixed lot: former CNN 
anchor Mary Alice Williams, who may not be permanent; conservative talk-show 
host John McLaughlin, and Dick Cavett, once of ABC, then PBS, and better known 
for his discussions of cultural creativity than of crass commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many industry eyes will be on the new venture, which reportedly is 
costing $65 million to start and is housed on two floors of a new, 
impersonal-looking grey office building in this busy New York City suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, founding father of CNN, will be watching. So will executives of CBS 
and ABC. David Meister, president of the Financial News Network, will take 
particular interest in how his new competitor fares. 
</P>
<P>
A neutral observer, Sander Vanocur, anchor of ABC's Sunday "Business World," 
feels that there is room in TV for another player in the fields of high 
finance, business news and consumer news. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that business is the best story around now," he says. "It's better 
than politics -- because business, financial and technological decisions always 
seem to move ahead of government's ability to deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
But Vanocur may be in the minority in feeling there is room for another 
business-news venture. Something may have to give. 
</P>
<P>
Consider. New York-based FNN, begun in 1981, says it serves 32 million U.S. and 
Canadian homes. CNBC says it needs 30 million homes to break even. 
</P>
<P>
Is a turf tiff imminent? Is the nation in for the cable equivalent of the 
gunfight at the OK Corral? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's as much that as it is walking down a deserted street late 
at night with your hands in your pockets, wondering about sounds and shadows 
and noises in the dark," says the feisty Meister. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what they really are," adds FNN's chief, saying he's not certain 
that CNBC will be only a financial and consumer news channel. He also asserts 
that it will have 6 million homes on debut day. 
</P>
<P>
There is muttering from the Turner camp, too, that CNBC is but a ploy to lay 
the groundwork for a general-news channel battling Turner's successful Cable 
News Network. 
</P>
<P>
Such talk nettles CNBC president Michael L. Eskridge, whose NBC-managed company 
is to be owned 50-50 by NBC and Cablevision Systems Corp. when an agreement 
reached last year becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his office, his cowboy boots propped on his desk, Eskridge flatly 
denies that CNBC is headed the way of a CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"No, absolutely not. Consumer news and business news are what we started out to 
do, and that's what we're doing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he says, CNBC's contract with its cable affiliates "precludes our 
doing general news." 
</P>
<P>
But comparisons with Turner's 24-hour news service are inevitable, although CNN 
only had access to 1.7 million homes when it began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, CNN had a staff of about 300 -- now up to around 1,600 world-wide. 
CNBC also is starting small, with a staff of 275 -- 200 of whom will be based 
in Ft. Lee. Fifty are anchors and reporters providing 17 hours of live and 
taped first-run material each weekday, with seven hours of repeat material 
aired after that. 
</P>
<P>
CNN took five years and $77 million in red ink before turning a profit in 1985. 
Eskridge projects that CNBC will be in the red -- he won't say how much -- for 
three years before turning profitable in the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
Also like CNN, CNBC is non-union, which keeps costs and salaries of its on-air 
and production staff well below those of the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, say officials of each company, being non-union allows for 
far greater flexibility than is possible under union contracts at the three 
major networks, including NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of young, aggressive people here who have a little bit of 
training in a few fields, and a couple of senior people who will help finish 
the training job," Eskridge says. 
</P>
<P>
"And those people will operate a camera one day, run a Chyron (character 
generator) the next day, sweep up the studio the third, then carry furniture 
around, write copy, do all this stuff that you just can't do" under rigid 
network-style union rules, he says. 
</P>
<P>
This ability to have jack-of-all-trades employees "is great from their point of 
view, and great from ours. . . . We can afford to survive." 
</P>
<P>
For the predominantly young staff, it's a way to break into the major leagues. 
But it's likely, once CNBC gets going, that they'll be hearing from organizers 
from technical unions and the American Federation of Television and Radio 
Artists. The latter represents on-air anchors and correspondents at the major 
networks, as well as entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
When NBC originally announced plans for its cable venture, they included a 
weekend sports package. But that idea was quietly dropped early this year. 
Eskridge, who was executive producer of NBC's Summer Olympics telecasts last 
fall, frankly admits that it "never made a great deal of sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
There already is a lot of weekend sports on cable and the networks, and CNBC 
wasn't going to able to afford "anything that was substantially different, yet 
it was going to cost us a significant amount of money for rights," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, cable operators felt the same way, he says. Now, Eskridge 
says, he'll use weekends for counter-programming against sports and trying new 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The start of CNBC's day may prove a tad early for West Coast viewers. Sign-on 
will be 3 a.m. PDT, because all CNBC shows will air nationally at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
A CNBC spokesman said the service will be available in the Los Angeles city 
area on United Cable and West Valley Cable. Elsewhere in Southern California, 
it will be on cable systems serving Ventura, Alhambra, Pasadena, Riverside, 
Santa Ana, Fullerton and Seal Beach. In San Diego, CNBC said, the service will 
be carried by Cox Cable and Americable. 
</P>
<P>
CNBC's weekday schedule so far has "World Business" starting the day, then 
"CNBC Morning," then the constantly updated, 8 1/2-hour "Money Wheel" of 
financial, market and business news segments, starting at 5:30 a.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
That's followed at 2 p.m. (PDT) by "Smart Money," a consumer show with a studio 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes "Media Beat," a half-hour report on media business that initially 
will be hosted by Mary Alice Williams, who last month joined NBC News after 
eight years at CNN. How long she'll remain isn't certain. Her main duties lie 
at NBC News in Manhattan, where she's substitute-anchoring regular network 
newscasts and planning to co-anchor a new prime-time news series. 
</P>
<P>
Her CNBC work "depends on how her schedule shapes up with her network 
obligations," Eskridge says. She'll probably do her CNBC turn "until it becomes 
logistically difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Following "Media Beat" will be "Business View," a one-hour wrap-up of the day's 
hot business news, then "The Dick Cavett Show" at 4:30 p.m. (PDT), in which 
he'll interview guests on consumer, business and life-style issues in front of 
a studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes "CNBC Live," described as a two-hour information show with a format 
akin to that a network morning program. That will be followed by "McLaughlin," 
another studio-audience show with the host interviewing people from business, 
politics, law, medicine, media and other fields. 
</P>
<P>
After that, everything except "Money Wheel" is repeated until 3 a.m. (PDT) the 
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
CNBC's 24-hour service continues on weekends, under the umbrella title of "CNBC 
Weekend." But it only will have three to 3 1/2 hours each day of first-run 
material, including a Sunday childrens' program called "Kids Are Consumers, 
Too." Other special weekend segments will cover real estate, the business of 
sports, workplace conditions, a women-at-work segment, and a "consumer 
speak-out" segment, a spokesman says.

LONG BEACH COUNCIL ACTS TO GAG GAGGLE OF GADFLIES

<P>
A motley assortment of self-anointed City Council watchdogs who live by the 
credo that silence is anything but golden are probably going to have to learn 
to hone their critical skills. 
</P>
<P>
For they may soon be given a mere three minutes to tell the council what they 
think. 
</P>
<P>
Often bogged down by the commentary of a faithful following of gadflies who 
seize the podium to complain, censure and sometimes even sing, the council is 
preparing an ordinance that would reduce from five to three minutes the amount 
of time an individual can take to address the council. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to move along and do the business we were elected to do," Mayor Ernie 
Kell said in support of the reduced comment period. 
</P>
<P>
It is not, Kell said, that the council doesn't want to hear from the public. It 
is that the council doesn't want to hear quite so much from a few individuals 
who "have to be heard for five minutes on every subject." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jan Hall noted that "our meetings continue to get longer and 
longer." Three minutes, she suggested, is quite enough to express one's 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more loquacious members of the council, Ray Grabinski, took 
exception, noting that "I talk as much as anybody down here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Thomas (Ski) Demski, an occasional podium commentator, suggested that 
if the council members were willing to limit their speeches to three minutes, 
he would too. 
</P>
<P>
A number of residents took advantage of their five minutes while they could, 
almost all of them opposing the move to shorten the speaking period. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't deprive us of saying what we need to say," implored Ann Morgon, who 
later in the meeting gave the council a five-page memo outlining her concerns 
about life in downtown Long Beach. She asked that she be allowed to discuss it 
at three consecutive council meetings, so as to fully air her thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that even a three-minute comment period would be longer than that 
allowed by many other city governments, Councilman Les Robbins informed one 
speaker that his remarks opposing the ordinance could have been more polished 
and concise. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rosenberg, whose fondness for discourse on city matters is behind the 
three-minute proposal, told council members that they had it all wrong. "We 
need more open government, not less." 
</P>
<P>
The council, as it so often does, ignored Rosenberg's advice and asked its 
staff to prepare the ordinance on a 7-2 vote. Grabinski and Councilman Warren 
Harwood voted no.

ALTERNATIVE TO LOSING HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
PUT NEW SCHOOL OVER RIVER, RESIDENTS URGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the prospect of watching the Los Angeles Unified School District 
level an entire neighborhood for a new elementary school, residents in Bell and 
Cudahy are urging school officials to consider building the proposed facility 
over the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting this week sponsored by Bell officials, about 60 residents of 
the two cities urged support of suspending the proposed elementary school over 
the cement-lined riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
The residents oppose the school district's current plan -- called the Bell 
Elementary No. 3 -- to tear down 263 houses, businesses and apartments and 
build the 1,000-student elementary school on 13 acres at Florence and Wilcox 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have put men on the moon, and we've developed the greatest architectural 
capabilities known to man," said James Kleinpell, a spokesman for the Committee 
Against Bell Elementary No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"With that in mind," Kleinpell continued, "we ask why can't a structure be 
built over the river that makes maximum utilization of space and doesn't 
displace men and women and children that potentially could become homeless and 
a burden on society." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, although stressing that they believe the Florence Avenue site 
is the best place to build the school, said that they will present the 
residents' plan to school district officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It beats displacing people," Mayor George G. Mirabal said. The city has no 
power to approve or veto a school district decision to build a school in the 
city, but can make suggestions, apply political pressure and offer to work with 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 residents would be forced to move if the school district 
approves the Florence Avenue site, which lies in both Bell and Cudahy. The two 
cities fall within the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the new elementary school would be bound by Florence on the 
north, Wilcox on the west, Live Oak Street on the south and an extension of 
Crafton Avenue on the east. Walnut Street, a cul-de-sac one block south of 
Florence, would be eliminated entirely. 
</P>
<P>
If built on the site, the school would be named Walnut elementary School, after 
the cul-de-sac. It will replace overcrowded Elizabeth Street Elementary School, 
scheduled to be converted into a junior high. A majority of students would come 
from Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the resident group's over-the-river proposal was considered an 
unlikely alternative to the politically sensitive task of forcing residents 
from their homes, city officials said. At the Monday night meeting, however, 
several city officials said that the idea should be pursued because it would 
not displace residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Innovative Approach' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very innovative approach," Councilman Jay Price said. 
</P>
<P>
The residents' proposal might allow the large school district to take advantage 
of a new school construction program that was established last year to finance 
creative ways to build schools without displacing residents, said state Sen. 
Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
The "Space Saver School" program, sponsored by Greene, will subsidize pilot 
programs by the first four school districts in the state -- two in Southern 
California and two in Northern California -- who submit a space-saving school 
plan, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans could include putting new schools over freeways, over existing buildings 
or underground, Greene spokeswoman Alex Ives said in a telephone interview from 
Greene's Sacramento office. 
</P>
<P>
Several school districts have inquired about the Space Saver School program, 
and Greene has met with Los Angeles Unified School District officials to 
discuss the concept earlier this year, he said. But no school has submitted a 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Offers Options' 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie R. James, building services administrator for the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, said district officials know of the Space Saver Program, but 
have not decided if the district will participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is unique," he said. "It offers options to districts who are 
highly urbanized. It tries to minimize the impact of displacing people." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether he would consider the residents' Los Angeles River 
plan. "We're still identifying a number of sites (in Bell) that have 
potential," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinpell and other residents who supported the over-the-river school plan 
offered no details about how the school would be built over the river. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Delegal, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works, said that any proposal to build a facility over the cement-lined 
riverbed would need to be approved by the county and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, which paved the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
She said that no structure has been built over the Los Angeles or the Rio Hondo 
rivers, which join about two miles south of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance for Discussion 
</P>
<P>
District administrator James said residents and city officials will have an 
opportunity to discuss the river plan and other alternatives at an April 25 
Building Committee hearing at the Bell Community Center. He said several 
optional sites will also be unveiled at the school district's 6 p.m. hearing. 
</P>
<P>
School district and city officials, in a struggle to balance housing and 
commercial growth against the need to build more schools, have been at odds 
since 1986 over a suitable site. The two sides agreed on the Walnut Street site 
earlier this year after Bell and Cudahy officials added a provision to require 
seven acres of ball fields and other green space.

YAROSLAVSKY VOWS TO CURB GROWTH DURING NEXT TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, savoring his convincing victory 
early Wednesday morning, pledged to explore all means of curbing further growth 
in the congested 5th District during his coming term. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman, who was criticized during the campaign for the amount of 
commercial development in communities such as Westwood, the Beverly-Fairfax 
area and Sherman Oaks, despite his co-sponsorship of the city's landmark 
slow-growth measure, conceded that more must be done to protect neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take a closer look at growth," Yaroslavsky said. "My district is 
overzoned, even now. . . . There's no question you'll see tighter controls on 
commercial development in the Westside and the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he will consider moratoriums on construction, downzoning and 
tougher planning guidelines as ways to slow the area's explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old councilman said he will also focus on such citywide problems as 
police staffing and the affordable housing crisis, signaling that he expects to 
continue his high-profile role on the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory Celebration 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, nearly 200 Yaroslavsky supporters crowded into his campaign party 
at the Beverly Plaza Hotel in West Los Angeles to cheer him on. There was wild 
applause as Yaroslavsky, accompanied by his wife, Barbara, emerged to claim 
victory about 10:30 p.m., and the celebration lasted late into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who was once expected to run for mayor, faced the stiffest 
challenge of any Westside councilman this year. Mike Woo, who represents the 
13th District, had nominal opposition and received about 71% of the vote. 
Marvin Braude of the 11th District was unopposed, receiving 100% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
After the election, Yaroslavsky said his constituents provided a mandate for 
his programs and policies when they reelected him with 63% of the vote against 
environmental activist Laura M. Lake, transportation consultant Ryan Snyder and 
political adviser Jack McGrath, a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peace Offering 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky extended his hand to Lake, his chief rival, but said his opponents, 
who were highly critical of his 14-year stewardship of the sprawling 5th 
District, must be more reasonable if they want to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants to play a constructive role will have a role to play . . . 
because we need to work together," he said. "But just because you don't get 
110% of what you want does not mean that your councilman is a sellout." 
</P>
<P>
Lake, the feisty Westwood activist who rallied the support of about 33% of the 
voters by branding Yaroslavsky a political insider and a latecomer to the 
slow-growth movement, did not immediately take up Yaroslavsky's offer. 
</P>
<P>
She said the councilman must prove that his commitment to quality-of-life 
issues is genuine before his opponents return to the fold. Lake, a UCLA 
professor, said she was proud of her showing on Tuesday. She blamed her defeat 
on Yaroslavsky's high name recognition and his fund-raising advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Lake, who raised less than half of the $215,000 collected by Yaroslavsky, said 
the race would have been closer if more challengers had emerged and if the 
voter turnout had been higher. Nevertheless, Lake said she is proud of her 
campaign. "We went into this with our eyes open," she said. "And we built a 
wonderful base against a political machine that's rarely challenged." 
</P>
<P>
Lake's campaign party at her West Los Angeles headquarters attracted about 75 
people. The event was fairly lively in the early going, but turned solemn as 
the returns showed Yaroslavsky holding on to his substantial lead. And by 
midnight, as the final results rolled in, the room was nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
Lake, 42, and her family will spend several days vacationing in Northern 
California. Upon her return, the environmentalist said she expects to continue 
her work as president of Friends of Westwood and Not Yet New York.

SATICOY PLANT CITED IN 1988 FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS 
</P>

The chemical fire that forced the evacuation of 1,500 Saticoy residents this 
week was only the latest sign of problems at Pacific Intermediates, a company 
that mixes compounds for the pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, a Ventura County Fire Department inspector was literally hit in the 
face with evidence that all was not as it should be at the plant just east of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"One minute it was clear," said former inspector Ken Bates, who now is a 
firefighter, "and the next, it was a cloud." 
</P>
<P>
Inspecting three 55-gallon plastic drums containing thionyl chloride, which 
turns to corrosive hydrochloric acid when exposed to air, Bates and county 
building inspector Ian Brodie suddenly were engulfed in toxic vapors. 
</P>
<P>
He and Brodie were treated at the Ventura County Medical Center, and 20 other 
fire officials who had contact with them were ordered to shower and change 
their clothes. Businesses in Pacific Intermediates' industrial park were 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
The company was later served a citation for the incident, which stemmed from 
improper storage of barrels outdoors, according to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition last year, Ventura County Environmental Health Department officials 
sent several written notices requiring the firm to correct problems connected 
to the production and disposal of chemical waste. 
</P>
<P>
When neither agency received a satisfactory response, the matter was referred 
to the Ventura County district attorney's office, which opened an investigation 
in December, deputy district attorney Marcia W. Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
A warrant to search the plant was prepared just last week, but had yet to be 
sent to a judge for approval, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote it, and the business burned down," Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
The company is owned by Benjamin L. Adams of Newbury Park, who could not be 
reached for comment.

DEVELOPER TO REDESIGN MALIBU PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
BUT DISPUTE REMAINS OVER PLAN, SCHABARUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a controversial $150-million project in Malibu agreed 
Wednesday to redesign plans for the development after it was discovered that 
its construction would disturb an ecological preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Ring, an attorney for VMS/Anden, the developer of Rancho Malibu, told the 
Los Angeles Regional Planning Commission that the group would revise the 
project and bring it back to the panel May 17. 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents of the proposed development of 62 single-family homes, a 
golf course, club house, tennis courts and a restaurant along Encinal Canyon 
Road, said they would continue to fight the plan unless the developer reduced 
the amount of grading needed for the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schabarum Investment 
</P>
<P>
The development calls for the grading of 4.5-million cubic yards of land on a 
270-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is opposed by homeowner groups in the area, became mired in 
controversy last week when it was discovered that Supervisor Pete Schabarum 
invested in a limited partnership that is managed by VMS Realty. The 
Chicago-based company and the Anden Group in Sherman Oaks are partners in the 
Rancho Malibu venture. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Schabarum, who voted to deny exclusion of VMS/Anden 
from Malibu's proposed city limits while he served on the Local Agency 
Formation Commission, had a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schabarum's investment in VMS Mortgage Investors Limited Partnership 
III has no direct financial link to the Malibu project, the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission guidelines on conflict of interest consider 
parent companies and their subsidiaries as one firm. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Turvill, a spokeswoman for the FPPC, said public officials may not 
participate in decisions "in which they know that they have a financial 
interest in or would have a material financial affect on their financial 
interest." But she added that if a public official was unaware of the 
connection between a parent company and its subsidiaries, "then it would 
probably be OK." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Knowing Link 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said Tuesday that he was unaware of the FPPC guidelines but has asked 
the county counsel's office for an opinion on the matter. Ruth Benell, LAFCO's 
executive director, said she would also seek a ruling from the independent 
counsel chosen to handle the pending Malibu incorporation matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you today that it was not known to me then or up to today," 
Schabarum said. "None of the stock I have acquired involved Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said it won't make any difference if the matter comes up before LAFCO 
again, because he said he no longer wants to serve on the state panel that 
decides incorporation matters. Benell said the matter is moot, since a Superior 
Court judge earlier rescinded LAFCO's approval of Malibu's cityhood petition 
and the incorporation process must start over. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the Rancho Malibu project is approved by the county Planning 
Commission, it would then go to the Board of Supervisors for a final vote. 
Schabarum said that if county counsel rules that he might have a conflict of 
interest, then he would disqualify himself from voting on the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Over Character 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Malibu property is located in a rural area off Encinal Canyon Road 
about two miles inland from Pacific Coast Highway. Residents object to the 
project, saying it does not fit in with the character of the surrounding rural 
area. 
</P>
<P>
County planners recently discovered the proposed development would disturb the 
nearby Steep Hill Canyon area that has been deemed environmentally sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Encinal Canyon Road resident Walt Keller, who is co-chairman of the Malibu 
Committee for Incorporation, said the project poses a threat to the ecology and 
would increase traffic in the area. He said residents are not opposed to the 
housing development but that the golf course and other aspects of the plan are 
too large for the area.

W. HOLLYWOOD CIVIC CENTER FOES CONFIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
BOND DEFEAT BUOYS PARK GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bolstered by the defeat of a bond issue to build a new fire station and library 
in West Hollywood, opponents of a long-awaited civic center on Wednesday 
expressed renewed confidence in their effort to prevent the center from being 
built in West Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who thought you couldn't fight City Hall and win now know you can, 
and the election should signal that we're going to press ahead full steam," 
said Tom Larkin, a leading opponent of the civic center who helped oppose the 
bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the endorsement of four members of the City Council and support from 
the politically influential Coalition for Economic Survival, a renters' rights 
group, voters on Tuesday rejected the proposal 1,928 to 1,764. 
</P>
<P>
With a two-thirds vote needed for passage, the $8-million measure captured only 
48% of the vote in a higher voter turnout than leaders on either side expected. 
It was the only local item on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the other side must have known they were going to lose, but I don't 
think they ever expected that we would actually win a majority," said City 
Councilman Steve Schulte, the only council member to oppose the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the election, opponents had another reason to celebrate. On Tuesday, 
the Los Angeles County registrar's office announced that the Save Our Parks 
Alliance, a group formed to oppose the civic center, had obtained enough valid 
signatures to place an initiative on the April, 1990, ballot aimed at 
preventing the center from being built in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a double whammy for us," said Larkin, the group's chairman. "It's 
been quite a week." 
</P>
<P>
He and others portrayed the election as a referendum on the civic center, 
claiming the bond issue was a backhanded attempt to squeeze more money for the 
center, since the fire station and library were originally part of the center's 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Had it been approved, the measure would have increased property taxes by up to 
$33.47 per $100,000 of assessed valuation over the next 20 years. The money 
would have been used to replace a single-engine fire station that officials 
have said is seismically unsafe, as well as quadruple the size of the county 
branch library that serves West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by plans to use scarce park space to build a civic center, opponents 
argued that the city should dip into its $14-million reserve fund to pay for 
the fire station and library and then let voters decide whether the center is 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bond issue tried to frame the election as an attempt to 
undermine rent control, noting that three of the council members supporting the 
measure -- John Heilman, Abbe Land and Mayor Helen Albert -- are on the 
25-member steering committee of the Coalition for Economic Survival. 
</P>
<P>
And on Wednesday, Heilman continued to sound that theme. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commitment Questioned 
</P>
<P>
"They (the opponents) don't have any commitment to the park or to the civic 
center. Tom Larkin and his friends wanted a vehicle to attack us, and they 
found it," Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, he and Land rejected the idea that the election reflected 
anti-civic center sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"This election wasn't about the civic center, as hard as the other side would 
like to make us believe that," Land said. 
</P>
<P>
Land, who will become mayor next week as part of an annual rotation, accused 
opponents of the measure of "jeopardizing the safety of West Hollywood 
residents" by opposing the bond issue "since they know that without the bond 
issue the city doesn't have the money to build the station." 
</P>
<P>
However, Schulte dismissed the accusation as "the same thing we've heard all 
along," and offered to join Land "in bringing a sensible plan to the council 
within the next two weeks to build a fire station." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire Station Support 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the way the other side has tried to paint it, we've never opposed 
the fire station," he said. "What we've objected to is the backhanded attempt 
to make a down payment on the civic center by using a bond measure, when there 
are higher priorities we should be giving attention." 
</P>
<P>
Schulte said he resented a campaign mailer sent out by proponents with the 
message that "our pro-tenant council members" supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"There are five pro-tenant members on the council," Schulte said, referring to 
himself. "I think anyone can see from the (election) results that there were a 
lot of tenants who opposed this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue would have provided $4.3 million to build the fire station, and 
$3.3 million for the library, with the remaining $400,000 to cover bond fees 
and other financial costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Facilities 
</P>
<P>
Had the measure passed, a two-engine fire station would have been built to 
replace the existing single-engine station on a narrow residential street that 
officials acknowledge is seismically unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The 21,000-square-foot library proposed in the bond measure was to have 
included up to 6,000 square feet to house the International Gay and Lesbian 
Archives, an extensive private collection of gay and lesbian research materials 
whose owners have expressed a desire to see them placed permanently in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
While the county provides library and fire services to West Hollywood, 
officials have said that county funds are not available to replace either 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
For civic center opponents, word that enough valid signatures had been 
collected to qualify the initiative for the ballot came as welcome news after a 
similar effort failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin's group submitted 2,806 signatures last July, but after an official 
count by the registrar's office the group fell 344 valid signatures short of 
the number needed then to place the initiative on the 1990 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enough Signatures 
</P>
<P>
In its revived effort, the group was able to collect almost half the signatures 
on Election Day last November, and last month submitted 3,358 signatures to the 
city clerk's office. On Tuesday, the registrar's office said 2,459 of the 
signatures were valid, 277 more than the minimum needed to qualify the 
initiative for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials who support building the civic center in the park, 
including a majority of council members, have hinted that they may try to 
challenge the legality of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Michael Jenkins has already been asked to determine whether a 1963 
court case involving a park in Fresno may have set a precedent that may be used 
to deny the initiative a place on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Paul Brotzman has said that Jenkins is likely to render an opinion 
on the matter "sometime within the next month."

SWASTIKA BURNED INTO LAWN IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone burned a swastika into the lawn of an apartment house near Beverly 
Hills High School last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-by-4-foot Nazi symbol, burned in with chemicals, is barely visible from 
the street, but tenant Harvey Myman said he found it disquieting. 
</P>
<P>
"If the (apartment) house was toilet-papered it wouldn't bother me so much," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wilmore B. Finerman, owner of the eight-unit building on Spalding Drive, 
said he believes the swastika was etched onto his lawn as a prank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Want to Make Fuss' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't call the police because I didn't want to make a fuss about it," he 
said. The swastika was first spotted last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bill Curtis, spokesman for the Beverly Hills Police Department, said there 
have been no complaints of such vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
But Rabbi Steven Robbins of nearby Temple Emanuel said such incidents should be 
reported and investigated, and those responsible punished. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it can be just an action of a group of wacky kids . . . when you see 
it move out of neighborhoods where you'd expect to see it, to neighborhoods 
where you wouldn't, then it becomes even more disturbing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether to report such incidents has always been a matter of debate, said 
Steven Windmueller, executive director of the Community Relations Commission of 
the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The argument is, if you report this, do you give it publicity and visibility, 
and at the same time the argument is that, no, you need to report it because it 
makes the statement that this kind of behavior is inappropriate and socially 
unacceptable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase in Incidents 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said in a report issued in January 
that anti-Semitic incidents rose last year in California and across the country 
for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
"(Swastikas) are not very common any place but they do occur," said David A. 
Lehrer, the league's regional director in Los Angeles. "In a country of 250 
million people, we have 800 incidents. It's quite commonly a neighbors' dispute 
or a problem with children in school."

COURT UPHOLDS BIAS RULING FOR WOMEN IN OIL FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that four Long Beach women were 
discriminated against when they tried to secure jobs at a Santa Fe Springs 
company in the male-dominated oil field service industry. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeal held that Plant &amp; Field Service Corp. 
discriminated against Marjorie Van, Modena M. Owens, Vinell Davis and Dorothy 
Johnson when they sought temporary oil field jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling upholds a District Court judge who ordered the company to consider 
more women for its temporary, manual labor jobs and to stop advertising 
entirely by word of mouth, which is believed to limit the number of female 
applicants.

Menachem Begin of Israel cleared the way for the Camp David summit during the 
Carter Administration. 
</P>

PARKING ORDINANCE CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week introduced and approved an interim ordinance that 
requires developers to provide 3.5 parking spaces for three-bedroom units in 
multifamily dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is effective immediately and replaces a similar ordinance 
approved last fall that mandated 2.5 parking spaces for three-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steven Gourley, who asked for the stricter limits, said many 
three-bedroom apartments are rented by groups of adults, who tend to have more 
cars, than by families with young children.

SUIT ON LAND JURISDICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles is expected to hear a suit April 19 by 
two Santa Monica Mountains property owners, challenging the California Coastal 
Commission's inland jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by Quaker Corp., owner of 272 acres about 6.5 miles from the 
ocean near Mulholland Drive and Las Virgenes Road, and by Michel T. Ghosn, who 
owns 160 acres in the same area. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the property owners seek to remove coastal zone and coastal plan 
jurisdiction at the ridgeline from Kanan-Dume Road to Topanga Canyon. They 
argue that maps of the area drawn by coastal commission staff and approved by 
the state Legislature were drawn in error. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also requests damages for the plaintiffs, who for years have tried to 
develop the property. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the litigation would remove thousands of acres of mountain land 
from coastal commission jurisdiction and open up development in the Santa 
Monica Mountains.

HOUSING HEIGHT LIMITS

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council's Planning Committee will consider a motion to 
limit multiresidential housing heights citywide to 35 feet on May 11, 
Councilman Marvin Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Waterhouse of Pacific Palisades organized a community campaign in 
support of stricter height limits last year after a 71-foot condominium was 
build on Sunset Boulevard near his home on Wildomar Street. Waterhouse received 
a Golden Sparkplug award from the Palisades community council for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said the council may vote on the ordinance this summer. Braude said that 
if the ordinance does not pass, he will reintroduce it for implementation in 
the Palisades only.

RECYCLING SYSTEM EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PLASTIC BOTTLES

Downey is expanding its residential recycling program to accept plastic soft 
drink and mineral water bottles in addition to glass, newspapers and aluminum 
cans. The city will start accepting the plastic bottles Monday, recycling 
coordinator Kathy Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey started its recycling program for residents of single-family homes in 
1976. Participants are provided with a 32-gallon barrel at no cost to store the 
refuse, which is picked up every other week. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 of the city's 24,000 single-family residences participate in the 
program, Simmons said. A recruitment drive will be held this weekend to try to 
boost program participation to 50% or 60%, she said.

'HOT POTATO' AT THE DMV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RE: "Queen" Cathie Wright whose daughter, Victoria, can do no wrong. At least 
this seems to be the consensus of mother, the courts and especially the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
As a retired DMV employee, that kind of record would cause immediate revocation 
of the driver's license, at least for you and me. 
</P>
<P>
And the incident of vital information missing from DMV files and court records 
sounds like it was advised not to be entered as it was considered a "hot 
potato." 
</P>
<P>
I understand Judge Bruce A. Clark is tough and observes the law. Perhaps he was 
advised the issue was too sensitive or "Queenie" got to him. 
</P>
<P>
Before I retired I was advised not to write this type letter as it would put my 
job and promotions in jeopardy.

WARNS AGAINST PAYING IN ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Thursday, March 30, I experienced an activity that must be symbolic of the 
breakdown of justice in California. As president of the Continental Assn. that 
coordinates the activities of 150 nonprofit funeral/memorial societies in the 
United States, I had gone to Long Beach to offer testimony in a hearing 
conducted by the State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers. The board had 
proposed changes in regulations affecting the funeral parlors of the state -- 
and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
These changes would: 1) give the funeral businessmen more of their customers' 
money and 2) permit them to pay salespeople with their customers' money, to 
promote the sale of prepaid funerals. The funeral industry has since 1983 tried 
to get these benefits by legislation. Now the state regulatory board that is 
supposed to protect consumers was proposing to bestow them by a change of 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
After two hours of testimony involving the American Assn. of Retired People and 
the nonprofit societies -- but dominated by funeral industry representatives, 
the board, composed of two morticians, a "public" member whose wife is in the 
funeral industry and two other public members, voted to give the industry 
yearly $40 for every $1,000 of the customer's money held in trust for payment 
of a future funeral (up from $25 per $1,000) -- and permission to pay for 
promotion of pre-need funeral plans out of that money. Could there be a more 
obvious example of a conflict of interest? 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit funeral/memorial societies do not recommend paying for a funeral 
in advance of need. For consumer-protecting funeral information, readers may 
write to Channel Cities Memorial Society, P.O. Box 424, Santa Barbara 93102.

Jack O'Connell of all people should not be a victim of this foolish recall 
attempt. He would be the first one to care about the people in the so called

and discourses on subjects from wife beating to Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev. Participants will be allowed to camp on the Sierra Quad lawn on 
campus during the event. 
</P>
<P>
The object of the conference is to demonstrate how a more peaceful world can be 
built, said Carol S. Kelly, a child development professor at the university and 
director of the International Institute for Violence Prevention, which 
organized the event. The institute, formed in 1986, consists of 200 Cal State 
Northridge teachers, students and community members who are working to develop 
peace topics in the university's curriculum, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want just another conference," she said. "We can't afford just to 
look at what we don't want -- we don't want spousal abuse, child neglect, 
nuclear annihilation. We have to look at moving to what we do want." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, organizers said, participants will be asked to submit written 
reports on their visions for the future -- a clean planet or a world without 
political borders, for instance. The reports are to be presented to the United 
Nations next year. 
</P>
<P>
The $20,000 to run the expo, which organizers predict will draw 2,500 people 
during its three days, comes from donations, Kelly said. The events will be 
free and will be held at the Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
For children, games are scheduled such as "hug tag": You're "it" if you are 
tagged while not hugging somebody, and the hugging limit is four seconds per 
person, said Jack Foley, associate professor in leisure studies and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Even college students have a lot to learn about peace, said expo student 
coordinator Lisa Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
"People my age are so much into 'What am I gonna do . . . ? How am I gonna make 
money?' " and don't feel "connected to foreign policy and global decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood will be on a panel discussing student involvement in such movements as 
the French Revolution and U.S. civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Other panels will feature students from England and Argentina discussing the 
Falklands/Malvinas war. The university debate team will argue the pros and cons 
of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
55 Community Groups 
</P>
<P>
About 55 community groups will offer workshops or information booths, including 
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, Survivors of Physical and Emotional 
Abuse as Kids, the California Vegetarian Assn., Gray Panthers of the San 
Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP, the War Resisters League 
and the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Keynote speakers include the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., a longtime peace 
activist; Stanley Sheinbaum, an organizer of the Americas Watch Committee of 
Southern California and one of five American Jews who met in December with 
Yasser Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, and author Riane 
Eisler, who wrote "The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future," a book 
about societies throughout history in which men and women have been equal 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Listen 
</P>
<P>
There are no scheduled speakers who believe that a strong military is the route 
to peace, but people with that opinion are welcome at the expo, Kelly said. "We 
have to be open to listening to them. We're trying hard to understand each 
other's position." 
</P>
<P>
The expo will also feature workshops on date rape, domestic violence, gang 
violence, racism and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope each person who comes -- children, youths, adults -- will leave not 
only with more information and resources, but leave feeling empowered to . . . 
do at least one thing to make a better world and make a difference," Kelly 
said.

8TH-GRADERS' WRITING ABILITY HAS MODEST GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Education has released school scores for a test of 
eighth-graders' writing ability in the 1987-88 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, California's eighth graders made modest gains over last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987-88 statewide average on the California Assessment Program direct 
writing exam was 256, six points higher than the 1986-87 average of 250. That 
meant that, although they are gradually improving, most eighth graders are fair 
to marginally adequate writers, state education officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Below are scores for schools in Ventura County. Officials offer these 
guidelines on how to read them: 
</P>
<P>
The scores are scaled between about 100 and 400 and allow comparisons with the 
state average of 256. 
</P>
<P>
A different group of eighth graders is tested each year, which could account 
for large jumps or drops in scores. Other factors are changes in socioeconomic 
status. For instance, an influx of students whose parents have a high level of 
education could result in higher scores. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, state officials said, the 1987-88 test was more demanding than the 
previous year's exam. The latest exam required students to be prepared to write 
six, as opposed to four, types of essays. The two new types of writing added 
were a biographical sketch and a story. The other categories were 
autobiography, evaluation, informative report and description of a problem and 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
School districts are in boldface, followed by individual schools. Scores for 
magnet programs, continuation schools and other programs with small numbers of 
students have been omitted. The state does not provide individual student 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
Officials may notice that the score for their school for the 1986-87 academic 
year, the first year in which the test was administered, has been revised. 
Department of Education officials said they learned a few weeks ago that an 
outside firm hired to compute the scores miscalculated the standard deviation, 
a common formula used to rank test results. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987-88 scores were calculated using the correct standard deviation, state 
officials said.

VENTURA HAVING TROUBLE WEATHERING LONG SEASON PLAGUED BY SHORT GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest question at Ventura High? Whether the Cougars can beat the weather 
to the finish of a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars have had two consecutive home games end prematurely because of the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, vice principal Helena Torres-Reaves halted a Channel League game 
against San Marcos because of a first-stage smog alert. It was the first time 
in six years that an alert of that magnitude had been declared in the area. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Cougars had a league game against Rio Mesa stopped with the 
score tied, 8-8, in the eighth inning because of darkness, despite objections 
from Ventura Coach Dan Smith and Rio Mesa Coach Rich Duran. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last two games have been called because of dumb things," Smith said. 
"There was as much daylight as the inning before. Duran and myself wanted to 
continue. I think the umpire had an appointment." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he has never heard of game being stopped because of poor air quality 
and he has worked in smoggier places than Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to coach in Riverside where the smog can really get bad, but I don't 
ever remember having a game stopped because of smog," Smith said. "I know San 
Marcos was upset and we were upset, too. We were playing one of the best games 
of the season and it's stopped because of smog. It's not like baseball is a 
continuously strenuous activity like football." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he was annoyed to find out that his game was the only one in Ventura 
County that was postponed. The game between Nordhoff and Righetti was 
interrupted for 45 minutes before it was completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Buena played their game," Smith said. "I know a swimming meet at our 
school wasn't stopped because I could hear the starter's gun still going off." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who improved to 7-7 overall and 3-1 in league play, received 
credit for a 7-2 victory. San Marcos, however, has filed a protest with the 
Southern Section office, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Add Cougars: Ventura pitcher Gary Myers struck out the side on nine pitches in 
the first inning against San Marcos. He allowed only two unearned runs and had 
seven strikeouts to earn his second victory. Myers (2-4) entered the game with 
an earned-run average of more than 4.00. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best-pitched game of the season," Smith said. "I wished the game 
had lasted longer." 
</P>
<P>
Streaking Spartan: When Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High defeated Inger Miller 
of Pasadena Muir in the 200 meters at the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday 
night, it was Burnham's third consecutive Arcadia victory in the event. 
</P>
<P>
Her time of 23.63 was a season best and the second-fastest high school time in 
the country this season, behind Miller's 23.62. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to run this fast this early in the season," said Burnham, who 
lost to Miller, 11.59-11.64, in the 100 meters earlier in meet. "When I came 
off the turn, I just told myself to relax and go after her. I figured that if 
it was my time to beat her, I would. And if it wasn't, I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200, also lost to Miller 
in the 100 at the Alemany-Northridge Relays at Cal State Northridge on March 
18. 
</P>
<P>
"She's extremely strong right now," Burnham said of her rival. "I knew it 
wouldn't be easy to beat her this season." 
</P>
<P>
Add Burnham: Though no official records are kept, Burnham's five career 
victories and three second-place finishes at Arcadia might be the best total 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Burnham placed second to Tami Stiles of Hawthorne in both the 
100 (12.36) and 200 (24.61) in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, she won both races in 12.07 and 24.47, respectively, and as a 
junior, she lowered those marks to 11.65 and 23.94 to defend her titles. 
</P>
<P>
Though her 100 win streak was snapped by Miller on Saturday, Burnham's times of 
11.64 and 23.63 put her ahead of last year's pace, when she ran personal bests 
of 11.28 in the 100 and 23.45 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Last add Burnham: The Rio Mesa senior said she has narrowed her college choices 
to USC, UCLA and Texas. Burnham originally considered five schools, but has 
dropped Tennessee and Nevada-Las Vegas from the running. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar face: Larry Lawrence doesn't need an introduction when he takes over 
the Santa Clara football program for spring practice in May. Lawrence has been 
coaching many of the players for years. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, the team's defensive coordinator last year, was selected Friday as 
the new head coach. He succeeds Steve Dann, who resigned in January to pursue 
business interests. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year veteran of the Oxnard Police Dept., Lawrence was Tim Gutierrez's 
first football coach when the all-state quarterback was a 9-year-old on the 
Oxnard Chiefs. He has coached youth football since 1970 and also has been an 
assistant at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to joining the varsity staff at Santa Clara, Lawrence ran the school's 
junior varsity program for three seasons, winning two Frontier League 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be a head coach at a varsity level," Lawrence said. "I 
didn't think I would get the opportunity because I don't have a college degree, 
but I probably have enough credits to get one." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gutierrez, running back Kwinn Knight, tackle Leo Berry and 
linebackers Augie Maciel and Carlos Martinez will be top returning players. 
All-league center Ted Lawrence, the son of the new coach, will also return. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll continue to throw as much as last season," Lawrence said. "We'll 
probably run more plays out of the shotgun because we'll have a younger 
offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara had a 44-14 record in five years under Dann, including an 11-1 
record last season. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy filled: Greg Ropes has been selected to replace Ken Barone as boys' 
basketball coach at Newbury Park, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ropes, a teacher at Thousand Oaks High, coached Camarillo during the 1986-87 
season, filling in for John Harbour, who took a year off. He guided the 
Scorpions to a 4-16 overall record and a mark 3-9 in the Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
Ropes also has coached women's basketball at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Barone resigned Feb. 22 after coaching two separate stints totaling 11 years. 
Newbury Park finished 13-12 last season, 4-8 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for contenders: Ventura College is alone in first place atop the 
Western State Conference baseball standings going into the final three weeks of 
the season, but that doesn't mean that Coach Gary Anglin thinks the Pirates are 
the best team. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think Valley is the best team in the conference because it has the 
most experienced pitching staff, the best hitters and is doing the little 
things to win," Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (21-8, 9-3 in WSC play) has won six of its last seven games, but the 
Pirate hitters are struggling. The Pirates are fourth in the WSC with a team 
batting average of .297.

PORN CASE FIGURE LOST SCOUTS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An Orange County man who Los Angeles authorities allege was involved in a child 
pornography ring is now being investigated by Huntington Beach police because 
he served as an assistant scoutmaster for a Boy Scout troop in that city. 
</P>
<P>
David Negrette, 26, of Westminster was dismissed from the Scouts in 1988 for 
not meeting the "leadership standards" of the youth group, according to Devon 
Dougherty, a spokesman for the Orange County Council for the Boy Scouts of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty refused to elaborate on why Negrette was dismissed, but he did say 
that there was "no relation" between the dismissal and the child pornography 
charge that Negrette now faces. Dougherty also refused to disclose the number 
of the Huntington Beach troop. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Detective Sgt. Bill Peterson said Wednesday that investigators 
were interviewing boys 8 to 14 years old from the northern part of Huntington 
Beach who may have come in contact with Negrette. He declined to be more 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
"Right at the moment, I can tell you that we have not identified any victims 
from Huntington Beach," Peterson said. "We are having meetings and interviewing 
people to try to identify possible victims, but we are having some difficulty 
in finding them." 
</P>
<P>
Negrette and Jerry Houchens, 49, of Santa Ana are being held in Los Angeles on 
$150,000 and $200,000 bail, respectively, on suspicion of soliciting young boys 
in Mexico to participate with them in the making of pornographic videotapes. 
Also charged was John Bauer, 52, of Los Angeles. Bauer, a former priest, is the 
group's ringleader, detectives allege, and is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fourth Man Sought 
</P>
<P>
A fourth man, Victor Feliciano, 29, of Rosemead, is also being sought by 
authorities for his alleged involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, Negrette and Houchens all were charged with conspiracy to distribute 
child pornography throughout the Southland and the United States. Houchens 
pleaded innocent Wednesday to the conspiracy charges in a Los Angeles court at 
his arraignment. A preliminary hearing for both Negrette and Houchens is 
scheduled April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that the group lured the Mexican youths -- all ages 8 to 14 
-- into participating in the videos by paying them a few dollars. The tapes 
were allegedly filmed last year in motels in and around the city of Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Bill Dworin of the Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited 
Child Unit said that investigators so far believe that the three victimized 
only the Mexican youths, but that Huntington Beach detectives, along with Los 
Angeles authorities, would continue their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"As of yet we have no information to believe that either Negrette or Houchens 
were involved with any boys in Orange County," Dworin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Shocked 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Negrette, who lived in a Westminster trailer park, greeted the 
news of the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. employee's arrest with shock. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always real nice -- a quiet fellow, always well-dressed and never a 
problem," said Carl Dobos, a manager at the park in the 14000 block of Hoover 
Street. "When he was arrested, we were amazed. He seemed to just come and go 
from work and that's it," Dobos observed. 
</P>
<P>
Dobos said the only time that Negrette had a problem in the large park was when 
his video camera was stolen from his mobile home last November. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, we didn't think too much about it. But after he was arrested, the 
police took several different pieces of gear out of his trailer. Lots of 
cameras, VCRs and stuff like that," Dobos added. 
</P>
<P>
Along the well-kept, tree-lined Santa Ana street where Jerry Houchens lived, 
neighbors of the man who always agreed to watch their houses while they were on 
vacation reacted with disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable. There would be nothing in the world that would make me 
believe that he could have done something like that," said J. H. Dever, a 
next-door neighbor.

COUNTY EASES BACK ON BILL TO PROTECT PACTS WITH BUILDERS 
</P>

<P>
Averting a confrontation with environmentalists, Orange County officials on 
Wednesday acceded to watered down legislation that could have significantly 
strengthened the ability of developers to lock their building plans in place 
years before beginning construction. 
</P>
<P>
The county, pushing legislation authored by Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los 
Alamitos), agreed to amendments that would leave intact the right of citizens 
to challenge zoning changes and other building approvals, even if they stem 
from "development agreements" meant to give builders prior approval for 
long-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
The county's bill, as it was approved 7 to 0 by the Assembly Local Government 
Committee, would prohibit court challenges to development agreements 120 days 
after the agreements are approved by city councils or county boards of 
supervisors. The measure, which would take effect Jan. 1, 1990, also would give 
opponents 120 days to challenge any agreement approved before the bill was 
enacted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protecting Agreements 
</P>
<P>
However, the bill would not affect challenges to later government actions 
implementing development agreements, increasingly popular long-term pacts under 
which governments grant development rights in exchange for a builder's 
agreement to finance public works projects, such as roads and sewers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is meant to protect developer agreements approved by Orange County in 
recent years which cover the construction of about 60,000 new housing units 
during the next 20 years. Without the bill, a county lobbyist and Assemblyman 
Brown argued, the agreements could be subject to challenges for 4 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"With the major financial commitments made by developers and builders, a 
four-year statute of limitations would have severe financial consequences," 
Brown told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Carrell, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said the environmental 
organization is not opposed to a statute of limitations as long as it does not 
restrict the right of citizens to challenge environmental impact reports, 
zoning changes or other parts of the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can live with it," Carrell said of the bill, which now moves to the 
Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think it is going to put some constraints on our ability to unravel 
what's in these agreements," Carrell said. "But we do acknowledge that some 
sort of statute of limitations was within the realm of reason."

Kai Wang stood in the family room of his home in Costa Mesa on Wednesday 
afternoon, cradling a studio portrait of his three children and remembering the 
day last spring when his two teen-age girls and his 11-year-old son presented 
the gift to his wife for Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the kind of children they are," Wang said softly of his daughters, 
Cori and Pei. "Nobody helped them do it, they just went out and got it taken by 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, on a winding, dipping stretch of Placentia Avenue near Estancia 
High School, a sporty maroon Honda Acura which Wang had given to his oldest 
daughter last fall spun out of control, crossed the center line and slammed 
into a light pole on the other side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Cori Wang, who was the only passenger in the car, was killed instantly. Pei, 
who was driving, suffered massive head and internal injuries and was later 
reported in critical condition at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center. Both girls had just left Estancia High, where they were students. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence indicates that Pei probably was drag racing with a car driven by 
her boyfriend, also 16 and also an Estancia student, just before the accident 
occurred, according to Floyd Waldron, the Costa Mesa police investigator in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Kai Wang, owner of a landscaping business who brought his family to the United 
States from Taiwan 13 years ago, vehemently disputed that. 
</P>
<P>
"She would never race or speed. She was such a good girl," he said. "People 
should not assume they were speeding just because they are teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
A witness to the accident, a girl who was a passenger in the car Pei's 
boyfriend was driving, told the family that neither car was traveling faster 
than 50 m.p.h., said Sandy Wang, the girls' aunt. The speed of both cars had 
picked up, the witness told the family, because they were traveling downhill. 
The speed limit is 40 m.p.h. along that stretch of Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Waldron acknowledged Wednesday afternoon that not all of the witnesses to the 
accident had been interviewed. He said that skid marks on the road indicated 
that the Acura was traveling between 60 and 65 m.p.h. when it started braking. 
</P>
<P>
"They were almost certainly going faster than that before she tried to slow 
down," said Waldron. The race, he said, "was probably just a spur of the moment 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The force of the crash was so tremendous, Waldron said, that the entire right 
side of the vehicle was caved in, trapping Cori inside. Further investigation, 
he said, will determine whether anyone will be charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Waldron said numerous accidents have occurred along Placentia near the high 
school through the years and that most of them involved speeding. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Wang said Tuesday's tragedy had left Pei's boyfriend uninjured but 
devastated. Her family, she said, especially the mother of the girls, was 
reeling from the blow. Both girls, she said, were well-liked, had numerous 
friends and were very involved in school activities. 
</P>
<P>
Pei, who turned 16 in October, the same month she received her new car, played 
tennis at Estancia High and is a member of the school's vocal ensemble, said 
Estancia Principal Robert Francy. She stands out among the school's 1,400 
students, he said, mainly because of her singing. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally you don't see a sophomore in the ensemble, but Pei apparently got in 
while she was still a freshman," said Francy. Sandy Wang said Pei had returned 
Monday from her last out-of-town engagement with the chorale, a trip to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blood Drive Planned 
</P>
<P>
Cori Wang, whose Taiwanese name was Pei-Chen, was a budding dramatist. On the 
day of the accident, Estancia students said, she had been seen at the school 
dressed to perform in a play she had written. 
</P>
<P>
The students said they planned to organize a blood drive for Pei Wang, who has 
already undergone one round of surgery to repair internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Hall, a 15-year-old Estancia student who said he had a math class with 
Cori, spent part of Wednesday afternoon with three friends walking along 
Placentia to find the spot where the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
They set up a small wooden cross as a memorial at the scene of the accident. 
Hall said they left school early because being there was like attending "a 
6-hour funeral." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do any work," he said. "We just looked at films and talked about 
what happened. I couldn't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Estancia administrators said psychologists and counselors had been brought into 
the school to discuss the accident with students. They will remain as long as 
they are needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Cori Wang are scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at Dilday 
Brothers Chapel in Huntington Beach.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EL TORO; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD-CARE SUPERVISOR ALLEGEDLY MOLESTED 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 25-year-old supervisor of a child-care center at the El Toro Marine 
Elementary School in Irvine allegedly molested five boys under 10 years of age, 
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne Symons said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Howard Nokes of Huntington Beach, a supervisor, was arrested on seven 
counts of child molestation on April 3 after an investigation by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department and the Naval Intelligence Service at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
He was set free on $10,000 bail and placed on leave. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the El Toro base said the school and the day-care center 
operation are not in any way connected with the Marine Corps. The school is 
near one of the air station's gates and carries the Marine Corps name because 
of its proximity. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care center at the school was operated by the YWCA, whose director, 
Mary Douglas, said Wednesday she would not comment on the allegations against 
Nokes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you will appreciate my position," she said. "I just can't say 
anything now." 
</P>
<P>
Symons said she would ask the court to raise Nokes' bail from $10,000 to 
$100,000 when he is arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think with the number of children involved in this case . . . the low bail 
is not appropriate," she said.

UCI, AFTER CRITICISM, TO OFFER LIBRARY POST TO LATINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC Irvine Library, which has come under criticism for having no Latino 
librarians and few other minority workers, will offer a post to a Latina 
librarian this week, university officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The candidate, who has indicated that she will accept the job if offered, could 
begin work May 1, according to University Librarian Calvin Boyer. University 
officials would say only that the librarian, whose name was not released, is 
working at a university in the South. 
</P>
<P>
William Parker, acting vice chancellor for research, said the candidate was 
interviewed during a nationwide search and got the recommendation of the 
Library Review Committee, which oversees hiring and promotions. He confirmed 
that an offer will be extended to the woman this week. 
</P>
<P>
The library currently has seven unfilled librarian positions and is 
aggressively seeking qualified candidates from under-represented minority 
groups, Boyer said. Library officials Tuesday interviewed three women, 
including one black and one Asian, who are finalists for another pening. 
</P>
<P>
The actions follow the recent departure of two black librarians and the 
announcement that an Asian librarian plans to leave. All three are male. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, women and minority employees have complained that they have been 
unfairly denied raises and promotions and that the work environment is not 
hospitable to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Of 50 librarians employed by UCI, five are Asians, one is black and none is 
Latino. The support staff of 121, excluding student employees, includes 22 
minority members. 
</P>
<P>
Parker and Boyer have insisted that there is no pattern of discrimination in 
the library, which promotes and issues raises following recommendations by a 
peer review panel and approval by the office of academic affairs, headed by 
Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien. 
</P>
<P>
However, Parker confirmed that individual complaints are being reviewed and 
that the library is examining ways to improve overall management. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see rapid feedback on decisions, more frequent and candid 
discussions between supervisors and librarians and more open discussions about 
issues confronting librarians," said Parker, whose duties include the library. 
"Those are the kinds of practices that will produce a more professional 
environment; they are not in response to isolated cases." 
</P>
<P>
Campus Ombudsman Ron Wilson, however, has charged that "institutional racism" 
is perceived by some library employees and said that the library has not done 
enough in the past to recruit and retain minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers speak for themselves," Wilson said. "If people don't feel welcome, 
they are not going to come and stay. We can offer money, but what really 
matters is freedom to do your work in a professional atmosphere, unencumbered 
by ethnic insensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that in an investigation this year, he substantiated complaints 
that some library employees had mocked Asian and Middle Eastern library 
patrons. A cultural-sensitivity workshop was subsequently scheduled for library 
employees, but university officials said the session was planned before the 
complaints arose. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of a Latino librarian was among the demands presented Monday by 
student protesters who met with UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, Executive Vice 
Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien and other top administration officials. In addition, 
the students called for increased recruitment of minority students and faculty, 
establishment of an African studies department and increased funding for 
minority programs. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason told the students that almost 20% of new students admitted for the 
fall semester are from under-represented minority groups, which at UCI are 
blacks, Latinos, American Indians and Filipinos. In addition, Tien said that of 
40 faculty positions for which offers have been made for the fall, 22 were 
offered to minority or female candidates. 
</P>

LEGAL LOOK AT ANTI-GAY EFFORT DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before putting the measure on a ballot, the Irvine City Council has ordered a 
legal analysis of a controversial initiative that would remove homosexuals from 
the protection of a human rights ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in Orange County that the issue of equal rights for 
gays has been put before voters. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday night told the city attorney to report back May 9 on the 
legal and other ramifications of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative qualified for the ballot after the Irvine Values Coalition, a 
group made up primarily of residents who are religious fundamentalists, 
collected 5,433 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, if approved, will remove the words "sexual orientation" from the 
ordinance, which was passed last year and bans discrimination on the basis of 
sex, race, religion, physical handicaps, marital status and sexual orientation. 
The measure will also require approval by the city's voters on any future law 
involving sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran said he wants the city attorney to study the initiative so 
that council members have as much information as possible before assigning the 
measure to an election. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council could hold the election on Nov. 7, consolidating it with the 
school district's election at a cost of $35,000, or wait until the council 
elections on June 5, 1990. A move by Councilman Edward A. Dornan to assign it 
to the November ballot, without the attorney's report, failed 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Peotter, chairman of the Irvine Values Coalition, says his group prefers 
waiting for the 1990 election so that the measure will not cost the city money. 
But if the city schedules a park bonds election in November, he prefers the 
earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy the citizens will have an opportunity to have a say on this," he 
said, adding that the initiative will delete "special protection for gays and 
lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equal vs. Special Rights 
</P>
<P>
But James Boone, the mayor's appointee to the human rights committee that 
recommended the ordinance, said the ordinance guarantees equal rights, not 
special rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It applies to everyone equally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boone said Peotter's group is "trying to impose their moral and religious 
standards on Irvine. . . . It is clearly an attempt to establish their right to 
discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that voters will reject the initiative. Orange County is 
conservative on issues of defense and economics but is "pro-choice, 
pro-privacy. . . . They want government out of their bedroom."

3 DEAD SEA LIONS FOUND; GILL NET BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three dead sea lions washed ashore Wednesday in Sunset Beach, and a federal 
official said the mammals were probably drowned in commercial fishermen's gill 
nets. 
</P>
<P>
"About 99% of the sea lion deaths we investigated earlier this year, when there 
was a rash of sea lions washing ashore between Seal Beach and Huntington Beach, 
all were caused by gill nets," said Joe Cordaro, a marine biologist with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro said that all the information he received about the dead sea lions 
found Wednesday indicated that their deaths occurred far out in the ocean and 
probably after they had been caught in gill nets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action by Allen 
</P>
<P>
The new deaths of sea lions in Orange County waters emphasize the need for 
state legislation limiting the use of gill nets, Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress) said. 
</P>
<P>
Gill nets are narrow-weave devices that are set upright in the water to catch 
fish by entangling their gills in the meshes. The nets are already banned from 
most of Northern California's ocean waters, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The sea lions and other mammals, such as porpoises and harbor seals, that 
become trapped in gill nets die horrible deaths," Allen said in a telephone 
interview from her Sacramento office. "I think my bill to move the gill nets 
out of our coastal waters is the most important environmental piece of 
legislation before the Legislature this year," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has introduced a measure, Assembly Bill 1, that would ban most uses of 
gill nets in waters heavily populated by marine mammals. The bill would set up 
a "Marine Resource Protection Zone" from the coastline to 3 miles out in the 
ocean, ranging from Point Arguello to the Mexican border. The zone would also 
include waters of less that 70 fathoms around the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Other Creatures Imperiled 
</P>
<P>
"The restrictions are needed because gill nets kill thousands of marine mammals 
-- dolphins, sea lions and seals -- each year," Allen said. "Gill nets also 
imperil the stocks of halibut, white sea bass and other populations through 
overfishing." 
</P>
<P>
Allen's bill proposes to raise funds to compensate commercial fishermen by a 
new $3 "Marine Resource Protection Stamp" to be required of people fishing in 
ocean waters in the state. The $3 would be in addition to the $11 charge now 
required for a state ocean-water fishing license, Allen said. The new stamp 
would be sold only through 1993 and would not be required of one-day fishing 
permits, so as not to affect tourism, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The stamp is projected to raise $4 million to $5 million during its existence, 
Allen said. "The money raised would be used to buy out those gill-net fishermen 
fishing within the 3-mile Marine Resources Protection Zone," she explained. 
"This compensation will provide commercial fishermen the investment funds 
needed to switch to alternative gear that is less destructive to the marine 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
But Nello Castagnola, president of the California Gillnetters Assn., said the 
organization is opposed to Allen's bill. "It's the same old stuff we've been 
fighting for years," he said. "Of course we're opposed to it." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the first hearing on her bill is scheduled for Tuesday by the 
Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee. She said many environmentalists 
and sports-fishing advocates favor the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
One prominent Orange County environmentalist, Dennis Kelly, a professor of 
marine biology at Orange Coast College, said Wednesday that he enthusiastically 
endorses Allen's bill. 
</P>
<P>
"As one who has seen what happens to mammals who become trapped in gill nets, I 
can tell you it is very unpleasant," Kelly said. "Those mammals are very 
intelligent beings, and they die slow, agonizing deaths when they become 
trapped in gill nets. I would really like to see it stopped, and I certainly 
support Assemblywoman Allen's bill."

A Santa Barbara man was convicted Wednesday of laundering more than $24 million 
in narcotics proceeds for two Colombian cocaine organizations that sold the 
drug in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Von Metzger, 65, was convicted of 36 counts of conspiring to aid the 
distribution of cocaine and to defraud the United States and making false 
statements on federal documents. He faces sentencing June 12. 
</P>
<P>
After a 2-week trial in U.S. District Court, jurors found Von Metzger deposited 
millions of dollars in cash into Santa Barbara-area banks in 1985 and 1986 and 
transferred the funds to South American banks. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gordon said Von Metzger's organization laundered the 
money for two suspected Colombian drug kingpins, Jose Miller and Eduardo 
Losada.

MCCASKILL IS CALMLY STEPPING BACK TO THE PAST; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER WEATHERING A ROUGH SPRING, RIGHT-HANDER REGAINS HIS FORM OF 1986 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill's got this good-news-bad-news thing down pat, not that he's 
particularly fond of the routine. It's only April, but the Angel right-hander 
already hasbeen on an emotional roller-coaster ride this season. 
</P>
<P>
He began spring training full of optimism, hoping the nerve problem in his 
right arm that prematurely ended his 1988 season on Aug. 18 was nothing more 
than a painful memory. 
</P>
<P>
But he ended spring training wondering if he'd ever get another out after the 
triple-A Edmonton Trappers slapped him around for nine runs in 4 1/3 innings of 
the Angels' final exhibition tune-up. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill bounced back to win his first start, though, holding Seattle to four 
hits and one run over seven innings last Friday night. And Wednesday night, he 
boosted his record to 2-0, holding the Oakland Athletics to two hits for six 
innings of the Angels' 5-0 victory at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the good news. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill left the game Wednesday night with a two-hitter because his upper 
back stiffened and Manager Doug Rader decided to give his well-rested bullpen 
some work. 
</P>
<P>
"I could've kept pitching," McCaskill said, explaining that the stiffness was 
minor. "I didn't want to come out, but it's the old kid-gloves-with-McCaskill 
thing. He's got a hangnail so you gotta watch out." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he became aware of McCaskill's problem in the fourth inning and, 
after a discussion with pitching coach Marcel Lachemann during the sixth, 
decided to "shut Kirk down" and give relievers Greg Minton and Bryan Harvey 
some work. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, after all, has not been the most durable pitcher around. He missed 
most of the 1987 season after surgery to remove bone chips from his right 
elbow. Then there was the nerve problem last year. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the really scary last couple weeks of spring, when McCaskill 
felt just fine and pitched perfectly horribly. 
</P>
<P>
Things were looking so bad after his final two starts of the spring that Rader 
said "protecting" McCaskill was one of the reasons he decided to open the 
season with 11 pitchers instead of the more-traditional 10-man staff. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looking more for a display of skill than performance in the spring," 
Rader said, "but when one of your starting pitchers doesn't have any better 
command than that, to say it's disturbing is to put it lightly." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill felt pretty much the same way. He watched some old videotapes of 
himself from 1986 (when he was 17-10) and tried to remember what it felt like 
to be successful. Then he went out and shut down the Mariners and everybody in 
an Angel uniform felt considerably better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all that spring training garbage is behind me now," McCaskill said. 
"This game wasn't so much a desperate situation like the Seattle game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my problems were one part mechanical and two parts mental. When things 
were going bad, my mind was going 100 miles per hour. I was thinking about 
August in April. I wasn't focusing. Basically, I've just calmed myself down, 
and now I'm concentrating much better." 
</P>
<P>
That's evident. The A's may be without Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire at the 
moment, but their lineup still is considerably more formidable than say, the 
Edmonton Trappers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was delighted with the way he pitched," Rader said. "He got a little wild at 
times, but as far as his stuff and overall command goes, he was excellent." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill said the cold and damp of Wednesday evening may have played a part in 
his back problems, but he says the stiffness hasn't dampened his spirits "one 
iota." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just your standard stiff back," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to worry about, Angel fans. The man whose revitalization is considered 
by many to be a key to the team's chances for success says he's back . . . even 
with a stiff back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm a key to this pitching staff," McCaskill said. "I'm just one 
member, and I hope I can stay healthy and help this team." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he's certainly helping. And, well, he's semi-healthy, anyway.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / BARBIE LUDOVISE;

SHE KNOWS WHERE SHE'S GOING, BUT SOMETIMES NOT WHERE SHE'S BEEN

<P>
There's a standing joke among members of the UC Irvine women's tennis team. If 
team captain Kathy Rose has something of value one day, she'll probably lose it 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, a senior and the team's No. 2 singles player, has had, from time to time, 
some trouble keeping track of her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
First it was her tennis rackets. Rose said they mysteriously disappeared en 
route to a tennis tournament at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I had them when I left the house for the tournament," Rose said. "But 
when we got to Texas, they weren't with me." 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Rose borrowed a spare from a teammate and proceeded to win all of 
her matches. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was her tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"When we left this tournament in Northern California, Kathy had two shoes on 
her feet," Anteater Coach Doreen Irish said. "When we got home, she had just 
one shoe. The other was never found." 
</P>
<P>
Then it was her car. 
</P>
<P>
"We drove through four lots on campus looking for it," Irish said. "It just 
wasn't anywhere. But then we found it in the parking lot of the hotel her 
parents were staying at. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an explanation for that one, though." 
</P>
<P>
Rose had forgotten that her parents had arranged to borrow the car. 
</P>
<P>
Absent-minded? Rose admits, at times, it's true. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny things happen like that all the time," she said. "Everyone gives me a 
hard time about it." 
</P>
<P>
But it's all in fun. 
</P>
<P>
On the tennis court or in the classroom, Rose, a 21-year-old social ecology 
major, rarely loses her way. Although her overall singles record of 9-9 is not 
spectacular, Rose has been a stabilizing force for Irvine as team captain for 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Especially this year, because Irvine (10-13 overall) has not had the most 
stable of seasons. Injury and illness have haunted the Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
"This year it's been so up and down," Rose said. "It's different from last year 
(when the team finished 18-6 -- its best record since it was 23-4 in 1977). 
</P>
<P>
"When your team does well, it's like everything keeps rolling, the wins seem to 
just come. But when there's sickness and injuries . . . well, everyone's really 
got to concentrate on their own game really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said her concentration on the court has been a greater challenge this year 
because she is scheduled to graduate in June and then plans to go into 
corporate health management. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing her weightlifting Wednesday morning, Rose ordered a bowl of 
granola and skim milk at a Newport Beach coffee shop and listed her present 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I like helping people, especially helping them get fit," she said. "Like I 
just heard about this machine that measures people's body fat and cholesterol 
and lean body mass. . . . I heard they cost about $5,000, but I'd love to have 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Rose is a part-time intern at the Irvine Medical Center, where, among other 
duties, she writes exercise therapy programs. She is also an on-campus peer 
health adviser, which means she organizes health, fitness and nutrition 
workshops for students in the dormitories and high school students. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're starting to do drug and alcohol prevention workshops," said 
Rose, whose mother, Sharon Rose, is the national chairperson of the Red Ribbon 
Campaign, a national drug prevention group. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Rose, who was a nationally ranked junior tennis player while growing up 
in Davis, Calif., said she has little desire to play professionally after she 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see pro tennis as my life," Rose said. "It's just not for me. With all 
the travel and the life style, it's too mentally draining and there's so many 
good players." 
</P>
<P>
Rose got a taste of the hard-core tennis life style when, as a junior in high 
school, she attended Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
"It had its ups and downs, but mostly it was like boot camp," she said. "Lights 
at out 10. Get up and play by 8 a.m. No girls by the boys' dorms. No food 
allowed in the rooms. . . . "My boyfriend there had given me a huge Hershey's 
Kiss, but during a room search they found it and took it away. 
</P>
<P>
"Life's a little different in college." 
</P>
<P>
With just three weeks remaining in her collegiate career -- without a chance of 
a berth into the NCAA Championships in May, the Anteaters will finish their 
season at the Big West Conference Championships at Ojai, April 27-29 -- Rose 
said she'll be happy to retire into the world of career and recreational 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rose: "Most of my friends say, 'No way. You're not going to play (on the 
pro circuit) this summer?' But I just want to work and have some fun now. It's 
time to do other things." 
</P>
<P>
In men's tennis, senior Mark Kaplan, 26-5 and on a 20-match winning streak, was 
named the Volvo tennis player of the month for March by the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Coaches Assn. Kaplan, ranked 14th in the nation, went 15-0 during the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Trevor Kronemann, ranked 20th, is 22-14; sophomore Mike Briggs from 
Corona del Mar High is ranked 58th and is 19-9, and junior Richard Lubner is 
21-15. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (18-6) are ranked fifth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Victory No. 1: The men's volleyball team won its first Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. match Tuesday night by defeating 14th-ranked Loyola Marymount, 
15-12, 12-15, 15-13, 15-10, at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Anteaters' first after 18 conference losses. Sophomores 
David Pettker, an outside hitter, had 25 kills and Steve Florentine, a middle 
blocker, had 24 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (7-24 overall, 1-18 in the WIVA) is ranked 17th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning its program as a club sport in 1987, Irvine is in its second 
season of intercollegiate competition. All Irvine players will return next 
season.

MONTGOMERY WINS THIS MATCHUP; 
</P>
<P>
HOMER OFF FULLERTON'S ARIAS HELPS SUNNY HILLS TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are sibling rivalries, and then there's the special relationship between 
Fullerton High School pitcher Rene Arias and Sunny Hills outfielder Jon 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, a native of Mexico, moved into Montgomery's home 2 1/2 years ago after 
Arias' mother moved back to Mexico. He has remained at Fullerton and has 
developed into one of the school's premier athletes. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched a no-hitter in the Southern Section 3-A division playoffs as a 
sophomore. He was the starting varsity quarterback last fall and was among the 
county's top three-point shooters in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery has been selected to play in this summer's Orange County All-Star 
football game as a defensive back, but for the most part, his athletic exploits 
have been overshadowed by Arias'. That is, until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery hit a three-run homer off Arias that keyed a five-run outburst in 
the sixth inning in Sunny Hills' 10-8 victory at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Fullerton (7-6-1, 4-2) out of a first-place tie with Sunny 
Hills (10-6, 5-1) in the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery hit an 0-2 curveball high over the right-field fence to give Sunny 
Hills a 10-5 lead and chase Arias (5-2). Afterward, Montgomery was asked if the 
play would be discussed at the dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm going to say to Rene was that it (homer) was a lucky shot," Montgomery 
said. "I'll feel more uncomfortable talking about it than he will. I was 
looking for a curveball and got lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have rather hit it off somebody else than Rene. Whenever I hit against 
him, I try to block it out of my mind, but I'm always aware that it's him on 
the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Arias said the pitch was a fastball, but there was no argument that 
Montgomery's homer took Fullerton out of the game in a ballpark where the 
center-field fence is only 175 feet away from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad pitch that took us out of the game," Arias said. "I won't see Jon 
until tomorrow, but I'll congratulate him and tell him, 'Nice game.' I made 
some bad pitches today, but we get another shot at them Friday." 
</P>
<P>
George Montgomery, who invited Arias into his home, was caught in the middle of 
the confrontation between his son and Arias. 
</P>
<P>
"I had mixed emotions," he said. "My family has grown very close to Rene, and 
he's almost become a son to me. I was happy for Jon, but I was hurting for 
Rene." 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 4, Sonora 3 -- Rob Szente had an RBI double with no outs in the sixth 
to give the Highlanders (7-5, 3-3) a 4-3 lead at La Habra. David Stevens (2-3) 
pitched a six-hitter, striking out seven, for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Troy 12, Buena Park 5 -- Matt Carter had a grand slam in a five-run first 
inning for the Warriors (10-4, 5-1) at Troy. Carter had three hits and three 
runs scored.

LITTLE ROCK 'BOND DADDY'; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESSMAN ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA S&amp;L CASE 
</P>

<P>
A Little Rock, Ark., businessman, indicted on racketeering and fraud charges in 
connection with the failure of North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana, 
has been arrested, the FBI said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Morgan, 53, owner of Southland Securities in Little Rock, was arrested 
Tuesday at his business on a warrant issued in California, according to FBI 
spokesman Ron Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was indicted along with five others by a grand jury in Los Angeles on 
bank fraud and conspiracy charges dealing with multimillion-dollar losses 
suffered by the now-defunct North America. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-count indictment was related to the failure of that savings and loan in 
1987 and alleges violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organization, or RICO, statute, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
The founder of the S&amp;L, Orange County dentist Duayne D. Christensen, died 
in a one-car accident in January, 1987, on the morning the S&amp;L was put into 
receivership by the federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan made an initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate H. David Young and was 
released on his own recognizance, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said Morgan was "described locally as a broker and a real estate 
venturer. He has owned several different ventures, most of which are closed." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, Wolfe said, was known in Little Rock as a "Bond Daddy" -- a type of 
mortgage banker of whom a number are located in Little Rock, the second largest 
mortgage banking center outside of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite well known in Little Rock," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said the other five people indicted were also arrested Tuesday, in 
California. He identified them as Janet F. McKinzie, 39, of Newport Beach; 
Fredrick Youngdahl, 53, also of Newport Beach; Armando J. Vasquez, 52, of 
Irvine; Victoria R. Walker, 42, of Elk Grove, and Thomas C. Clarke, 63, of 
Vista.

Just in time for Mother's Day, Tiffany &amp; Co. at South Coast Plaza has begun 
carrying its new perfumed bath collection. 
</P>
<P>
The collection -- which includes five new products -- marks the Fifth Avenue 
jeweler's entree into bath products and extends Tiffany's fragrance line that 
was launched in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The fragrance market hasn't grown in terms of consumer-unit sales over the 
last 5 years," said Susan Sussman, Tiffany's vice president of fragrance. "It's 
a very tough, competitive environment. . . . The only way to be successful is 
by being better." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, new products can also bring new customers. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing a collection of bath products also makes sense, considering that 
the bath business is more than 25% of the lucrative fragrance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany's bath-collection line includes scented body creme, body lotion, bath 
and shower gel and dusting powder that comes with a swan's down puff. All of 
them come in square containers that mimic the shape of the Art Deco facade of 
Tiffany's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for those "luxury accessories" -- as Tiffany has dubbed them -- range 
from $40 to $75 for 5 ounces.

TRANS COM TO BE SOLD TO SONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trans Com Systems, an Irvine manufacturer of stereo and movie systems for 
airplanes, will be sold to Sony Corp. for more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Selling was Sundstrand Corp., a Rockford, Ill., defense contractor hit recently 
with $198.6 million in fines and payments to settle a federal investigation of 
defense contract fraud. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation Sundstrand may have agreed to sell Trans Com to raise 
cash, but a spokesman said that is not the case. Instead, he said, Sundstrand 
sold the unit because it could no longer compete effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Trans Com has encountered a much more difficult market since the Japanese 
company Matsushita decided to sell its own stereo and movie equipment directly 
to airlines, bypassing a Trans Com competitor that had packaged Matsushita's 
systems for sale. 
</P>
<P>
By selling directly to the airlines, Matsushita was able to undersell Trans Com 
and other companies in the market. 
</P>
<P>
So Sundstrand decided to sell, since its "philosophy is to be the market leader 
in almost every business we're in," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sony should do better with the unit since it already supplies Trans Com with 
70% of its video and audio components. All the major airlines are customers, 
said the Sundstrand spokesman, and Trans Com had sales of $40 million last 
year. The company employs 260. 
</P>
<P>
The sale must be approved by both companies' boards. MICHAEL FLAGG

ARBY'S WILL CHALLENGE THE HAMBURGER GIANTS WITH A MAJOR EXPANSION HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Mary Ann Galante, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watch out, McDonald's and Carl's Jr. Arby's Inc. is betting that hungry Orange 
County diners will be willing to swap their burgers for roast beef. 
</P>
<P>
And to put its money where its mouth is, Arby's has announced plans to develop 
at least 20 Arby's restaurants in Orange County over the next 3 years -- an 
expansion that will more than double its presence here. 
</P>
<P>
The roast beef sandwich chain has signed an agreement with Kyotaru Co. Ltd., a 
Tokyo-based restaurant company, to build 20 franchise restaurants. Construction 
of the first should start within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Arby's also has commitments from other franchisees to build an additional 50 
restaurants in Southern California over the next 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Roberts, Arby's president and chief executive, said the company plans 
to open 400 additional restaurants in California within the next 5 years. "Our 
goal is to have 500 total by 1993," he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Arby's so bullish on California? 
</P>
<P>
"We like what we see in terms of demographics," Roberts said. He cited the 
state's dense population and highly competitive environment for fast-food 
dollars as factors that make the state attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"We do the strongest when you put us next to a McDonald's, a Burger King or a 
Wendy's, where the traffic pattern is established," he said. When a market is 
saturated with competitors, Roberts explained, customers are more likely to 
choose an alternative like roast beef sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Arby's sells only roast beef these days. The chain's menu includes a 
breakfast menu with croissants, sausage and biscuits, and chicken items such as

THERE'S NOTHING -- AND EVERYTHING -- BORDERLINE ABOUT FOSTER &amp; LLOYD'S 
SUCCESS

Foster &amp; Lloyd figure they wouldn't have been around very long in country 
music if they had shown up about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That's because nobody in country radio would have played their records. 
</P>
<P>
But Radney Foster, who hails from Del Rio, Tex., and Bill Lloyd, a native of 
Bowling Green, Ky., figure that they lucked out. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at the right place at the right time," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster &amp; Lloyd are country rockers, or rocking countrians, depending on the 
way one looks at things. But either way, one thing is clear: Country music fans 
like 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Their current single, "Fair Shake," from their new album "Faster and Louder," 
is already in the top 10, following a string of chart successes. 
</P>
<P>
They were asked about being on the borderline, the edge of what is considered 
country and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're just making music we enjoy and were influenced by as kids," 
Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it was the rock side of things -- the Beatles and the Byrds -- or the 
country side of things -- like Buck Owens, Merle Haggard and Glen Campbell -- 
in the '60s there was tons of stuff on radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill and I have been influenced by all those things, and I think we're trying 
to throw all those together. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there's a lot of rock influence and a lot of country influence. It 
works for us. I don't think there's a need to apologize for either one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said "strict credentials" are primarily for marketing purposes and not 
for listening purposes: "People will listen to whatever they like. And if you 
present them a good song, they should like it. There's all kinds of formulas 
for hit records, but the basic one is, 'Do you like it? Will you buy it?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Faster &amp; Louder" has a list of "guest pickers," the two singers said. They 
include John Cowan and Sam Bush of the New Grass Revival, great dobroist Jerry 
Douglas, and pop revisionist Marshall Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to stretch some of the boundaries on songs and think about 
different ideas," said Foster, adding that the album "was a great experience 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Foster &amp; Lloyd sing Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano. The Jack Rather Band opens at 9 p.m. Tickets: $13.50. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

'MASH'S' FARRELL LEADS CAST IN TV DRAMA ABOUT PATRICIDE 
</P>

<P>
Mike Farrell knew when he took on the role of Paul Gianelli, the attorney who 
defended a New York teen-ager accused of arranging her father's murder, that he 
wanted to put some of himself into the character. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw some videotape of him being interviewed," said Farrell, best remembered 
for his "MASH" role as B.J. Hunnicut. "I decided I wasn't going to do an 
imitation of him. I was going to create my own character. He was very real 
within the script." 
</P>
<P>
In the ABC movie "A Deadly Silence" on Sunday, as in actual events on Long 
Island, N.Y., Gianelli defends teen-ager Cheryl Pierson on a charge that she 
hired a schoolmate to kill her father. She contended that she had him killed to 
stop his sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I met the reporter who wrote the book," he said, referring to Dena Kleiman of 
the New York Times. "She was a terrific source of information. Gianelli was a 
straightforward lawyer whose practice was mostly domestic, but he had done some 
corporate work. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that interested me was that on a human level he really connected 
with this girl and became very committed to her welfare. The more he found 
about what her life had been like, the more passionate he became about her 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Kleiman's book related Cheryl's story of her years-long entrapment in an 
incestuous relationship with her father, James Pierson. It probed deeper, 
however, to reveal a conspiracy of silence by friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson was shot to death on Feb. 5, 1986, at his home in Selden. Cheryl, then 
16, was accused of paying a classmate $1,000 to kill him. She served 3 1/2 
months of her 6-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"A Deadly Silence" also stars Charles Haid as Pierson, a robust electrician who 
clung to such trappings of youth as fast cars and motorcycles; Sally Struthers 
as social worker Marilyn Adams; Bruce Weitz as Detective James McCready, and 
Heather Fairfield as Cheryl. John Patterson directed from a screenplay by 
Jennifer Miller for executive producer Robert Greenwald. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the circumstances" of Cheryl's case, Farrell said, "some people 
felt she should not serve any time at all but should be put on some form of 
probation. She was a person who was trying to extricate herself, albeit 
violently, from a terrible situation. 
</P>
<P>
"She hired a classmate to kill her father. Her class had discussed a story 
about an abused wife who had hired someone to kill her husband. She said, 'Who 
would do a thing like that?' and her classmate said he would." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell has not been in a series since "MASH" left the air in 1983. He had been 
a journeyman actor before that, appearing in two other series, but it was 
"MASH" that gave him star power. He has starred in several unsuccessful pilots, 
however, including the 1985 movie pilot "Private Sessions," in which he played 
a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would now prefer to devote his time to movies, as he has done for 
the last several years. He produces feature and TV movies and appears in some 
TV films. 
</P>
<P>
His production partner is Marvin Minoff. They produced the feature film 
"Dominick and Eugene," and Farrell also directed the TV movie "Run Till You 
Fall." He starred in "Memorial Day" and "Choices of the Heart." 
</P>
<P>
If many of Farrell's films seem to have messages, it's no accident. He is 
passionately committed to causes. 
</P>
<P>
One is fighting pollution; his next movie, "The Smell of Money," deals with 
toxic waste. He co-wrote the story with David Reiss. Albert Rubin wrote the 
screenplay. Farrell will produce and star in the movie for Turner Network 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie's about a man against the system," Farrell said. "His daughter 
becomes ill and dies from what he learns is toxic waste dumped into a stream by 
a factory. It's a one-factory town, and when he takes on the factory everyone 
turns on him rather than the polluter. We'll shoot it on location in Utah." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Farrell has been married to actress Shelley Fabares, who is 
co-starring in the ABC series "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just come back from El Salvador in 1982, and CBS asked me to go to their 
affiliates meeting in San Francisco," he said. "Shelley was doing 'One Day at a 
Time' and she was there, too. Neither one of us was married, and it turned out 
very well."

BALLROOM BRAWLS; 
</P>
<P>
THE FANS ARE AN UPSCALE BUNCH AT THE IRVINE MARRIOTT, WHERE 'NICE' IS THE WORD 
FOR FIGHT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Joey Bishop has been a fight fan for as long as he can remember. The 
71-year-old comedian remembers being thrilled at the opportunity to usher at 
the big bouts in Philly when he was a teen-ager, and the small neighborhood 
gyms were churning out more quality fighters than the local halls could 
showcase. 
</P>
<P>
He also fought as a senior welterweight in the Army and, as a young entertainer 
on tour, religiously sought out matches wherever he could find them. 
</P>
<P>
When he did his talk show, boxers were a staple. Bishop boasts that he "fought" 
-- at various times for various charities and varying chuckles -- heavyweight 
champions Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, George Foreman and Joe Frazier. He did 
Marciano's eulogy and Joe Louis' testimonial. 
</P>
<P>
And now Bishop, who is retired and lives in Newport Beach, is seated ringside 
in the Irvine Marriott's Grand Ballroom where, in front of a crowd of 1,140 on 
a recent Thursday night, boxing -- Orange County style -- is on display. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it here. It's a nice, family crowd, a great atmosphere for a fight," 
Bishop says between bouts. "You won't see any big names here, but it's a good 
card (program) and the fights are spirited. The fans are polite and 
well-behaved. I never miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Margot Condon, a teacher with a doctorate in education, the mother 
of nine and a big fan of Johnny Taipa, an undefeated bantamweight from 
Albuquerque who on this night hammers out a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband bought me season tickets as a birthday gift last year," says the 
Newport Beach resident, "and I told him, 'Get 'em for me again this year.' It's 
comfortable here, a nice atmosphere to see a fight." 
</P>
<P>
"Nice" seems to be the operative adjective here. There are no tuxedos or 
sequins in evidence, but the crowd is more upscale than the sport's seedy 
reputation would lead one to expect. Smoking is limited to the corridors 
outside the ballroom, so the air is both breathable and see-through. 
</P>
<P>
Waitresses circulate, bringing beer and cocktails to seated patrons. In two 
corners of the ballroom are buffets offering everything from popcorn and 
brownies to roast beef sandwiches and jumbo shrimp. In the other corners, 
bartenders dispense wine and mixed drinks at a brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, fighters now residing in Westminster, Santa Ana, Huntington 
Beach and other Southland cities battle each other spiritedly. Between rounds, 
young women wearing big smiles and microscopic bathing suits sashay through the 
crowd -- to the accompaniment of traditional wolf whistles -- with cards 
indicating the upcoming round number. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of Bishop's heroes has ever fought here, the Irvine Marriott 
boxing series has had its moments. Ali himself once showed up -- typically 
unannounced and with entourage -- to see Robert Shannon, a member of the 1984 
U.S. Olympic team, in one of his early pro fights. Promoter Don Fraser -- who 
in 1972 staged the title bout between Ali and Ken Norton -- adroitly moved in a 
new row of seats at ringside and let Ali work his magic. The Champ leapt into 
the ring and shadowboxed, reprising the Ali shuffle. The crowd, of course, went 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been memorable bouts: Jaime Garza, a former super bantamweight 
champ, battled Daryl Thigpen a few years ago in a back-and-forth thriller in 
which each fighter went down twice before Thigpen finally stopped Garza on an 
eighth-round technical knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake about it: Boxing has carved out a comfortable home for itself 
in Orange County. The 47 shows that have been staged at the Marriott since 
January, 1985, typically fill the 1,250-seat arena to more than 90% of 
capacity. The fights are held once a month, except in December. From January 
through August, fight night is on Monday, filling the void left by prime-time 
NFL games. The rest of the year, fights are on Thursday nights. The next fights 
are scheduled for April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Holding fights in hotel ballrooms "is a highly unusual phenomenon," says 
Fraser, head of Don Fraser Promotions, which stages the fights. Fraser says he 
has spent his entire adult life in boxing -- as publicist, promoter and 
official in and around Southern California. But he as "not tuned in" to Orange 
County, he says, and had to be persuaded by the Marriott to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
When Ed Proenza, then the marketing director at the Irvine Marriott, wanted to 
stage fights at the facility, he says he "had to sell it internally." 
</P>
<P>
"There was apprehension," says Proenza, who still works for the Marriott. "They 
were afraid boxing wouldn't draw the right kind of crowd. But I argued that if 
we didn't allow smoking, dressed the waiters in spiffy uniforms, offered valet 
parking, handled the beverage and food ourselves, charged $25 a head, then it 
could be a first-class operation. Hey, it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an affluent area far enough removed from Los Angeles to be a viable 
site," Fraser said. "It might not work elsewhere; it hasn't worked elsewhere. . 
. . Several other Marriotts have tried to stage fights: Santa Clara hasn't 
caught on, and in La Jolla, they flopped totally." 
</P>
<P>
So here, among the glass skyscrapers and business parks that seem to be 
sprouting up at every intersection, boxing has found a home. But Fraser is 
hardly amassing Michael Milken-like riches. His profits for each event are in 
the $3,000 to $5,000 neighborhood, and he must scramble to protect even that 
from spiraling costs -- his insurance has tripled and his rent doubled in the 
last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But things could be a lot worse. "This has been profitable from the very first 
show," Fraser says. "It was a sellout by the day of the fight; we had a good 
card, word of mouth was good, and it just sustained itself." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Luce, the hotel's current marketing director, says the fights "keep our 
name out there and are a good revenue source." Although the stay-over spinoff 
is minimal, Luce says that since most of the repeat customers work within 3 
miles of the hotel, they come directly to the fights from work and drop 
appreciable dollars into the hotel coffers eating, drinking and unwinding 
before the show starts. 
</P>
<P>
The live gate at $25 to $30 a seat (slightly less for groups) usually covers an 
evening's expenses of $25,000. The profits come from the amounts kicked in by 
the sponsors: Tecate Beer, Allen Cadillac and Olds of Laguna Niguel and, 
starting last month, the Camel cigarette division of R.J. Reynolds, which 
overlooked the no-smoking ban in the arena and handed out gifts and free packs 
of cigarettes in the corridors outside. 
</P>
<P>
The upscale nature of the crowd is precisely what attracted the program's major 
sponsor, Tecate Beer. According to Jerry Prial, division manager of Wisdom 
Imports, Tecate pays $30,000 a year to sponsor the fights. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who come here are our type of people: 21 to 35, upper-income, male 
and female," Prial says. "This is yuppie boxing. It's right up our alley. The 
identification Tecate gets from these fights is phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
Despite what Prial says, there is no more than a yuppie veneer to the Marriott 
boxing crowd. Far more typical are couples like Joe and Mary Ellen Siegel of 
Garden Grove, regulars at the Marriott fights since the start and boxing fans 
from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to go to the fights at the Olympic (the inner-city Los Angeles arena 
that hosted the Olympic matches in 1932), but it got to the point where it 
wasn't safe for my wife," Joe Siegel says. "This is a family atmosphere, and 
the promoters really give you a good card every time." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just people who buy tickets," his lwife says. "The promoters know 
us, know our names. They make us feel at home." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one night a month I look forward to," says Tim Reaves, 38, of 
Costa Mesa. "It's always exciting, always a good crowd. There are always 
celebrities. I like to bring friends here who say they don't like boxing. They 
invariably enjoy themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Bauly, a regular from Newport Beach, agrees. "The novelty of having fight 
nights right here in Orange County is still a draw," he says. "It's a little 
different from seeing the Rams or watching the Lakers on TV. You get out among 
friendly people and yell your head off." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been up against World Series games, Oscars, Emmys, whatever, and we draw 
despite that stuff," says Roy Englebrecht, event coordinator for Don Fraser 
Promotions. "It's only once a month, and if you need your boxing fix or your 
one night of uninhibited fun, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine matches will never lose their small-time allure. The size of the 
ballroom limits the size of the purses. Fraser says he has never paid a single 
fighter more than $5,000 and must keep a night's total purse to $10,000 in 
order to make money. 
</P>
<P>
So the fighters will always be up-and-comers. And they will always be on the 
small side, says Fraser, since the heavier weight classes traditionally command 
bigger purses. 
</P>
<P>
Not that this bothers devotees like Joe Siegel. "It's especially enjoyable when 
you can see someone fight before he makes a name for himself," Siegel says. 
"Then, after he makes it, you can tell your friends, 'I saw him fight when he 
was just starting out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Up in the ring, two kids with dreams bigger than either their reputations or 
their pocketbooks are trading flurries of punches as the seconds tick away in 
the final round of a bout that could go either way. The spectators are on their 
feet, stomping and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
It's Fight Night. The audience is as much into the fight here as they would be 
anywhere else, Joey Bishop would no doubt tell you -- if he weren't at this 
moment madly pounding his fists against the ringside table.

JOSEPH N. BELL: DOES HE FIGURE THE ODDS ARE IN HIS FAVOR? YOU BET

<TEXT>
<P>
I spent several days in Las Vegas last week and came home with my usual 
loathing for that place. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling has very little to do with whether I've won or lost. Although when 
I'm there, that isn't true -- I can feel pretty good about the place if I'm 
winning. But once I'm home, I hate Las Vegas. I also know that feeling will 
pass and I'll go back. 
</P>
<P>
I'll go back because I've loved gambling most of my life. 
</P>
<P>
This time I was in Vegas with my two grown daughters. My younger had a birthday 
(I dare not say which one), and the trip was a present from her sister and me. 
One of the traits I passed along to my daughters is taking pleasure in 
gambling. I used to think that was a considerable disservice, even though they 
play within their means. Now I'm not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
I started playing cards as an adolescent growing up in the Midwest. My brother 
and I would play bridge with my parents, and I have warm memories of those 
games. In high school, one of the principal recreations for the boys I ran with 
was poker. We even played the morning before our high school graduation 
ceremony, and when a guy we didn't like very much won, we paid him with 300 
pennies in a sack as we were waiting in line to get our diplomas. He knew he 
had to take it or lose it, and I'll never forget the sight of him marching down 
the steps with his diploma and a quite obvious 300 pennies bouncing in his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
In the military during World War II, gambling was a way of life. In preflight 
school, where church attendance was mandatory, I remember betting with the 
cadet next to me on whether the next hymn would be an odd or even number. We 
played hearts and poker for high stakes, and while I was overseas, I played 
bridge for a half-cent a point (which can get expensive). We used to prey on 
Pan-Am pilots when they came through our bases because they made a lot more 
money than we did and therefore tended to play recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, I carried this love of gambling into my later life. I suppose it 
could have been a serious problem -- for a time it threatened to be -- but I've 
learned how to stay within my limits. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has a great deal to do with my outlook on life, and I became very 
much aware of that this month when a plane flying out of John Wayne Airport 
crashed onto a tennis court near my home. The day after the crash, The Times 
carried interviews with people living in the area, most of whom expressed fear 
of its happening again. 
</P>
<P>
One said: "We're always nervous, and this confirms our fears." 
</P>
<P>
Another said: "The noise is a problem, but the other thing you know is that one 
of them is going to drop one day." 
</P>
<P>
And a third said: "Every day I see these planes take off. I can't tell you how 
many times I've thought of what might happen." 
</P>
<P>
We live in Santa Ana Heights, directly under the flight pattern for the airport 
and close enough, I suppose, to be in maximum danger of being victimized in a 
similar accident. I can honestly say, though, that the thought has never 
occurred to me. I'm sure that is partly because I have lived on military air 
bases, but I think that it is mostly because my lifelong association with 
gambling has made me very conscious of odds. 
</P>
<P>
Since I don't believe that God causes airplane crashes, I look at the chances 
of one's happening in my back yard as pretty remote. To worry about it would be 
rather like worrying about whether a tidal wave will hit Newport Beach. You 
would unquestionably be safer from a tidal wave in Des Moines, Iowa, but that 
probably isn't keeping very many people from living in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fear should not keep very many people from living near the airport, either. 
(The matter of noise is something else entirely.) According to airport manager 
George Rebella, there have been 19 aircraft "incidents" at John Wayne in the 
past 6 years. Ten took place within 200 feet of a runway and did not involve 
fatalities or injuries. Of the remainder, five were accidents that involved a 
total of 12 fatalities. During that same period, there have been more than 3 
million individual takeoffs and landings. All that adds up to some pretty good 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
Although I believe in odds, I also believe in taking every edge you can get. 
You don't push the odds by neglecting the maintenance of a car or a plane, just 
as you don't try to jaywalk across the traffic on Coast Highway. I take normal 
precautions; from there on, I figure, the odds are all on my side. Should I end 
up on a plane carrying a bomb or being shot at by a lunatic on the freeway or 
under a plane falling into my back yard, then I was only in the wrong place at 
the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
But the odds against any of that happening are astronomical, and to worry about 
such catastrophes -- assuming I've taken reasonable precautions -- would be a 
terrible waste of energy better devoted to something positive. 
</P>
<P>
That approach may not work for everyone. You've got to believe -- really 
believe -- that the odds very much favor your coming out of this day whole and 
sound, whether you're taking an airplane trip, driving on the freeway or just 
sitting in your own back yard. It does work for me. And maybe it has helped my 
daughters reach some sort of accommodation with the uncertainties of life.

ANN CONWAY: EXHIBITIONISTS HAVE BISTRO'S OPENING NIGHT COVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"I could just plaster myself against the wall and fit right in," said a 
colorfully dressed Debi Bremner, eyeing an equally colorful painting by Ellen 
Schriebman Salk on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true Exhibitionist. Bremner, a sartorial standout in a dress 
dappled in deep purples and reds, is president of the Exhibitionists, a new 
women's council of the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night marked the coming out party for the new group and for Santa Ana's 
newest upscale bistro -- Gustaf Anders, formerly of La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in tears -- devastated that Anders has gone," groaned Jeanne Jones, a La 
Jollan whose syndicated column "Cook It Light" is devoured by 15 million 
readers. (Jones' son, David Beek, is the manager of the sleek new hot spot.) 
"But then we decided that Orange County isn't that far away, so get ready to 
see a lot of San Diegans and La Jollans up here." 
</P>
<P>
That'll be just fine with Wilhelm Gustaf Magnuson, co-owner (with Ulf Anders 
Strandberg) of the Scandinavia-flavored restaurant. "It's strange to have such 
a big party and not recognize anyone," said Magnuson, eyes taking in the lively 
gathering of about 120 guests. "I'm used to knowing everybody." Well, if Monday 
night's fare is any indication, it'll take about one week for Magnuson to be on 
an air-kiss basis with locals. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the affable Magnuson stood behind the zinc-topped bar and helped 
guests heap creme fraiche onto golden caviar heaped upon crunchy unleavened 
Swedish rye bread. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the bistro's signature gravad lax -- literally, "buried salmon" -- 
served up with a mustard sauce so tangy it made you wish you had toted along 
some Tupperware. Not to mention the complementary wines provided by Robert 
Mondavi, a near-and-dear of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
And the dinner. On the please-keep-it-coming menu: cured beef sprinkled with 
truffle oil (ooh) and Parmesan cheese; red bell pepper soup with basil 
croutons; parsley salad; and Anders' famous fillet of beef in Stilton red wine 
sauce with creamed morels. 
</P>
<P>
On the scene: Don and Claudette Shaw (she's museum board president); Kitty and 
museum director Charles Desmarais; Anton Segerstom, with his stylish grandmum, 
Ruth Segerstrom; Elizabeth and Tom Tierney; Claire and Mac Burt; Marla Bird; 
Howard and Anne Cusic (who came up with the name Exhibitionists: "I was being a 
wise guy when I mentioned it," she said, "and darned if the board didn't decide 
it was a great name. I couldn't talk anybody out of it!"), and Teri and Dr. 
John Kennady. 
</P>
<P>
Hat's On to Olive Crest: What a madcap idea! The fine print on the invitation 
to Olive Crest Women's Guild's "April in Paris" benefit read: "Please wear a 
hat to the fashion event, as a donation will be made for every lady wearing a 
chapeau." 
</P>
<P>
Well, you would have thought the Royal Family was holding court at the 
Disneyland Hotel on Saturday. Hats -- 300 of them -- in every shape and color 
drifted into the ballroom on the perfectly coiffed heads of their chic wearers. 
There were black hats sprouting rose gardens. Blue hats sprouting ruffles. 
Yellow hats sprouting feathers. Even a rakish beret or two. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting $9 per hat," said Jodi Ferragamo, guild board member, attending 
with husband Vince, the former Los Angeles Rams quarterback. Nordstrom donated 
$3 per hat, an anonymous donor threw in another $5, and a Mrs. T. Duncan 
Stewart donated $1, said event chairwoman Judi Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo, a blond dynamo with a heart-stopping smile, said the women's guild 
tapped her on the shoulder 2 years ago, asking her to become involved in the 
fight against child abuse via fund-raising for the Olive Crest Treatment 
Centers in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three daughters," she said. "And I can't think of a thing they need. 
But on a visit to an Olive Crest home, I met a child who said he just wanted 
his 'own pillow.' Can you believe it? Just a pillow. I'm so glad I became 
involved. I can't think of a better way to help children." 
</P>
<P>
After a cocktail crush, the 525 guests enjoyed a luncheon and fashion show that 
featured summer togs and furs -- an unusual combo, but this was a delightfully 
unusual crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds were $45,000. Also on the committee: Peggy Mandarino, Shirlee Heidler, 
Colleen Casciari, Tami Hay, Jill Bull, Sally Rothbart, Kathi Davis, Linda 
Hearn, Sylvia Burnett and Carie Mourey. Vince Ferragamo was co-host of the 
event with actress Morgan Brittany, who arrived fashionably late with Alana 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
High Tea and High Hopes: Consider the Latina. "Culturally, she's taught to be 
more involved with her role in the family than discovering her potential," said 
Irene Martinez during a benefit at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. "In the 
Hispanic culture, the woman is the nucleus of the family." 
</P>
<P>
But if she is helped to discover her talents, if she is encouraged to become 
more upwardly mobile, "the whole community benefits," said Martinez, who is 
president of the Orange County chapter of the Mexican-American Women's National 
Assn. Members met on Sunday for "High Tea and High Fashion." 
</P>
<P>
"For example, 40% of Hispanics drop out of high school," Martinez said, "and 
unless we help turn that around, those young people, rather than being 
contributors, will take poor-paying jobs and create a whole cycle of concerns 
and issues." 
</P>
<P>
The organization was founded in Washington in 1974 to represent the concerns of 
Mexican-American women, its mission being to advance their educational, social 
and economic standing. The local chapter was established in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to develop the Hispanic woman's leadership ability so that, 
eventually, we can afford to hire an executive director and have office space," 
said Martinez, who added that the local staff is now composed solely of 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds -- $10,000 is hoped for -- will be used for scholarship funds and to 
defray costs of running the operation. Clothing designer Angela Palomina was 
chairwoman.

ASK THE VET: MANY DOGS MOURN WHEN CANINE BUDDIES VANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. Recently, we had our old Labrador put to sleep because of a long illness. 
Now the other dog, also a Lab, seems to mope about the house and is much less 
active. She seems to miss her companion but otherwise appears to be normal. 
Should we get another dog for her? My wife doesn't think that she will accept 
another dog. What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. R. Volkman, Orange 
</P>
<P>
A. When two dogs are together for long periods of time and one is suddenly 
missing, there does seem to be a period of mourning in many dogs. It may be due 
to a lack of companionship or an actual loss of affection. When this occurs, 
the pet should receive extra attention and affection to help him or her adjust 
to the change. In many instances, introducing a new puppy or very young dog 
will help your other dog recover from the loss and may even spark new life into 
her. A young dog or pup is easier and should pose no threat to the older 
established dog as they start to get to know each other. There is always a 
chance that the older dog will not accept any other dog or pup, so a trial 
period, if possible, would be best. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In the past several days, our miniature poodle has started dragging her 
bottom on the carpet and is starting to chew at her rectal area. When I checked 
her, there was some redness, so I put some ointment on there, hoping it would 
make her feel better. I have checked for tapeworms but have not seen any. What 
else should I do to help her? 
</P>
<P>
Marianne DeLaMar, Brea 
</P>
<P>
A. When a dog (or cat) starts to scoot or drag its bottom on the floor, it 
generally means that there is a problem with the anal sacs. There are two sacs, 
one on each side of the rectum, that contain a material that is used for 
scent-marking. Now and then the duct to the outside can become clogged, causing 
the sacs to fill and become uncomfortable. If left unchecked, the sacs could 
become infected and eventually require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Have your pet checked by your veterinarian, who will also check for tapeworms 
and the chance that there might be tumors starting, since both of these 
conditions will also cause some irritation for your pet. When you have your dog 
bathed or groomed, ask that the anal sacs be expressed. This will help minimize 
any problems.

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: HE COOKS UP A STORM FOR REALLY GOOD CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For $1,000 or so, Fred K. Bailey has been known to take over people's homes and 
prepare knock-their-socks-off gourmet feasts. 
</P>
<P>
That probably doesn't sound like much of a bargain until you figure that the 
cost is mostly tax-deductible and a very authoritative saying of grace is 
thrown in free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Father Bailey, 35, is a priest -- associate pastor of San Antonio Catholic 
Church in Anaheim Hills -- and his chef's duties are auctioned off to raise 
funds for worthy causes. 
</P>
<P>
A recent $1,000 winning bid bought a nine-course meal for a party of six that 
took 6 hours to consume. The menu included steamed mussels, various pates, 
cheeses, fresh shrimp, shrimp bisque, woven halibut and salmon poached in white 
wine and herbs, fresh fruits, mini filets of beef, blackened chicken, homemade 
bread and desserts -- all washed down with champagne and a variety of wines. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey says his parishioners have a lot more faith in his culinary skills than 
he does. "I always start the meals with great trepidation," he says, "and am 
more surprised, relieved and grateful than anyone when they turn out well. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, I have no formal training; it's just something I've picked up over 
the years and enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
An Anaheim native (his parents, Mary and George Bailey, still live there), 
Bailey is a graduate of Cal State Fullerton. It was while attending St. John's 
Seminary in Camarillo that he started cooking. "I began with cookies and 
brownies -- things like that -- and just kept moving up, from crock-pot dishes 
to formal meals." 
</P>
<P>
The recipe he shared with Guys &amp; Galleys is one of his favorites, a 
chocolate mousse cake that has (naturally) an angel food cake base. The name, 
"Spirited Mousse Cake," incidentally, has nothing to do with religion -- but 
rather the half-cup of brandy that's a key ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRED BAILEY'S SPIRITED MOUSSE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
2 angel food cakes, store-bought or homemade 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup brandy or favorite liqueur 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 pints whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1 cup granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
9 extra large eggs 
</P>
<P>
Pinch of cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
1 large package real chocolate chips 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup prepared coffee 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Using hands, chunk the cakes into lemon-size pieces and place in large mixing 
bowl. Sprinkle with brandy and set aside. In separate bowl, whip half the cream 
with an electric mixer until stiff. Mix in half the sugar and continue mixing 
until absorbed. Refrigerate. Separate whites from yolks of eggs and whip them 
until stiff peaks form. Sprinkle in cream of tartar while mixing. Now gently 
fold the meringue into the whipped cream and chill mixture. Melt chocolate in 
double boiler, add coffee and stir until smooth and glossy. Allow to cool (it 
doesn't have to be cold; warm is OK). With whisk, blend together chocolate with 
whipping cream-meringue mixture (scrape sides of bowl often to make sure it 
blends well). Add angel food-brandy mixture to chocolate mixture and stir with 
spoon or rubber spatula to make sure cake is thoroughly covered with chocolate 
without crumbling the chunks. Pour entire mixture into a spring-form pan and 
refrigerate at least 4 hours (overnight is better). Just before serving, whip 
remaining cream with remaining sugar. Remove cake from pan and coat with 
whipped cream. Garnish with grated chocolate or fresh strawberries.

13-DAY TRIP FIELDS YAHOO AND DORADO, BUT BIG TUNA ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was excitement at 22nd Street Landing in San Pedro last week when the 
Deluxe returned from a 13-day trip to Clarion Island 200 miles north of Cabo 
San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Trolling for wahoo and dorado resulted in big catches. 
</P>
<P>
On one stop there was suddenly a huge swirl of water as bluefin tuna broke the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers dashed for heavier tackle, but the tuna refused the bait and fish 
weighing only 15 to 25 pounds were decked. Capt. Chuck Ellis said anchovy bait 
would have raised the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Odnell of Torrance, trolling with a mackerel, had a marlin strike. After a 
45-minute fight the fish, estimated at 400 pounds, broke off. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gerber of Hawthorne hooked and released a 140-pound marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Milleson of Palos Verdes had a good catch of wahoo, dorado and tuna, as did 
Norman Woodruff of Redondo Beach and Delbert Marcus of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The total count of the long trip was 217 wahoo, 54 dorado and 14 tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Martinez of Wilmington, fishing from his boat the Antelope, brought to gaff 
a big halibut. Not possessing a scale, he headed to 22nd Street Landing and the 
flattie weighed in at 35 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Catches of spotfin croaker set the pace for surf anglers over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hawks of Torrance fished the surf at Dockweiler Beach and caught a limit of 
four- to five-pound fish. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Bret Janus of Long Beach, fishing Catalina Island on the Aztec, pulled a 
yellowtail out of the kelp and won the whopper of the week -- 28 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ivanho of Gardena won the jackpot aboard the Grande at Cherry Bank with a 
27 1/4-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Taft of San Pedro, aboard the Topgun, brought a 20-pound yellowtail out of 
the rocks at Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Merrill of San Pedro, fishing at Cherry Bank aboard the Explorer, won the 
jackpot with an 18-pound salmon grouper. 
</P>
<P>
Gum Baiz of Hermosa Beach, on the Redondo Special at Twin Roads, caught a 
15-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: 
</P>
<P>
During the recent heat wave the higher water temperature was reflected in 
catches of barracuda and bonito from Horseshoe Kelp to Rocky Point. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina anglers saw plenty of yellowtail but few bait-takers. Limits of bonito 
made up most of the island's catches. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the rock reefs and anglers 
caught 57 sand bass, four halibut and two bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar worked the Venice Beach area and anglers sacked 210 sculpin and 36 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman tried the bay and returned from a half-day trip with 125 mackerel 
and five halibut. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Southern Cal worked Twin Roads and claimed 244 
sand bass, eight rockfish, four halibut and three mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special took a half-day trip to Hermosa Flats and anglers landed 23 
halibut and 14 sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
The barge Isle of Redondo was invaded by mackerel and fishermen caught 510, 
plus 120 rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo, on two half-day trips, chalked up 241 
sand bass and 188 sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
The First String on the last rock cod trip of the spring to Cherry Bank 
returned with 600 rockfish and 10 lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Sportking worked Catalina and returned with 58 
bonito, 16 barracuda, seven sculpin and three halibut to 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits scored at Catalina with 83 calico bass and three yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge had a weekend count of 914 kingfish, 777 mackerel, eight 
halibut, three sand bass and one black sea bass, which was released. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory headed to Catalina and anglers chalked 
up 29 barracuda, 21 calico bass, 20 bonito and 10 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec fished the west end of Catalina and anglers claimed 45 calico bass, 
30 sculpin, 10 sheepshead and one yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica worked San Clemente Island and anglers sacked 230 rock cod and 28 
cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Sanders of Torrance, fishing Silverwood Lake, caught and released 218 
pounds of striped bass. He kept only two fish, which totaled 39 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Tolson of Gardena fished Irvine Lake and used cheese to land a 3 
1/2-pound trout. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Adchio of Mar Vista tried Castaic Lake with power bait and caught a 
three-pound trout.

<P>
AGENCY FIRES 20 IN PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has fired 20 employees and suspended 11 others in the Department of 
Water and Power after an extensive investigation of drug use and theft at the 
city maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
The city notified 33 of the department's 280 employees last month that they 
would be dismissed, suspended or demoted after an investigation found that 
workers were using cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines and alcohol on the job, 
that drug sales had taken place at work and that some employees had stolen 
personal property and city property. 
</P>
<P>
Department supervisors had recommended the dismissal of 26 employees, but David 
Plumb, the department's general manager, reduced the penalty for six of them 
after reviewing the evidence and conducting conferences. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dismissals, Plumb suspended 11 employees and ordered salary 
reductions for two others. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Ed Aghjayan said those who were dismissed can file appeals 
and grievances, but they cannot return to work during the appellate process. 
Employees who were suspended for drug use can return to work only if they agree 
to random drug testing, he said.

PERFORMANCE OF CITY MANAGER QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How do you reward a city manager who has been so ineffective that he has lost 
the services of every department head in a period of four years? Some 
departments had multiple replacements during that brief span. Efficient 
management personnel have either resigned or been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the reward the South Pasadena City Council came up with at its April 5 
meeting. All but one council member praised the city manager. A huge scroll 
with John R. Bernardi inscribed in vivid green lettering was presented to him. 
He said he was "speechless." 
</P>
<P>
Only minutes before, the council unanimously approved a 10% salary increase 
that Bernardi determined was "commensurate with my abilities. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
If this farce was intended to be an April Fool's trick on South Pasadena 
taxpayers, it was four days too late!

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY; 
</P>
<P>
CITIES FILE PROPERTY TAX SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suit challenging the constitutionality of how property tax revenues are 
distributed among California cities was filed Friday in San Bernardino Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City, along with Rancho Cucamonga, Compton, Carson and El Segundo, are 
petitioners in the suit, which charges that the system unfairly penalizes 
cities that levied no or low property taxes before Proposition 13 was approved. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition passed in 1978 limited property taxes to 1% of a parcel's 
assessed value. State legislation passed to implement it calls for distribution 
of property taxes according to cities' tax rates before the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
As a result cities, such as Temple City, which did not have a property tax 
receive no revenues, although their residents pay the same flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Sturgeon, attorney for the petitioners, the suit was filed in 
San Bernardino County because Rancho Cucamonga is the biggest loser in the 
current system among the five cities. No court date has been set. The suit was 
filed in San Bernardino because the state Supreme Court declined without 
comment to hear the case on March 31.

'HORRIFIED' OVER DESTRUCTION OF SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is with great sadness that I write this letter. I am horrified by the total 
lack of respect some people have in Glendora for the constitutional rights of 
fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The continuous destruction of "No on 1530" signs was culminated on Election Day 
by the destruction of most remaining "No" signs. (City ordinance No. 1530 would 
have raised the maximum height for two-story homes in some areas from 25 to 30 
feet, and would have permitted heights of 35 feet with City Council approval.) 
It is regrettable that this is the standard of behavior our children have to 
follow. I found my rights denied by not being allowed to speak at the Rancho 
Glendora Mobile Home Park by the actions of a person representing the "Yes" 
position. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that this letter is necessary so people will be aware of what took 
place during the recent election. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were signs destroyed and individuals not permitted to speak but some 
members of our community decided to be judge and jury by deciding that the 
citizens should not read distributed material by removing it from cars. 
</P>
<P>
For those individuals who attempted to circumvent our basic rights, I only have 
contempt. For the future, I pray for an electorate more mature and respectful 
of the rights of others.

LIGHT-RAIL ROUTE SELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors has selected the Foothill (210) Freeway as the route for 
an east-west light-rail line through Pasadena. In action this week, the board 
directed its Light Rail Alignment Task Force to study safety and access 
problems at stations along the line and to consider terminal sites in east 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The board action, in effect, discards two routes through downtown Pasadena that 
had drawn strong opposition from property and business owners on Green Street. 
One of the routes would have turned Green Street into a transit mall, and the 
other would have put rail cars on both Green Street and Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole said the choice was dictated by the technology being used by 
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a 
light-rail line from Long Beach to Los Angeles and plans to extend it through 
Pasadena. The rail cars would be boarded from platforms three or four feet high 
and 90 feet long. Cole said that putting such platforms on city streets is 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said the light-rail system will serve commuters, but do little or nothing 
to enhance the downtown area. He said the city's next step should be to push 
forward with development of a local transit system, such as trolley cars on 
rails or rubber tires. 
</P>
<P>
The board instructed the Light Rail Alignment Task Force to give attention to 
developing a local transit system and to resolving safety, access and parking 
problems connected with the light-rail line.

CLOSED MEETINGS BY COUNCIL-ELECT RULED LEGAL 
</P>

<P>
The City Council-elect did not violate the state's open meetings laws by 
excluding the public and press from some of its discussions, a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge ruled this week. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper had filed suit against the city and the five council 
members-elect -- who were elected March 7 and will be sworn in next Tuesday -- 
complaining that they had violated the Ralph M. Brown Act, which requires 
elected officials to conduct virtually all business in public. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley Daily Tribune was granted a temporary restraining order 
on March 24, which compelled the council-elect to permit the public and press 
to attend its meetings and provide 72 hours notice of the matters to be 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Judge Dzintra I. Janavs reversed this ruling, rejecting the 
newspaper's request for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the Brown 
Act does not apply to elected officials who have not taken their oaths of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Disappointed 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're disappointed that she chose not to apply the Brown Act," said 
Stephen Contopulos, the newspaper's attorney. "But we hope the council members 
. . . will voluntarily subject themselves to the Brown Act." 
</P>
<P>
Council members-elect this week hailed the ruling, but said they did not expect 
it to have any effect on the proceedings during the final few days before 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't foresee any more meetings that wouldn't be open anyway," said Mayor 
Pro Tem-elect Paul Horcher. An attorney, Horcher said he believed the judge's 
ruling was consistent with the law. "The judge decided she would adjudicate and 
not legislate." 
</P>
<P>
As part of their defense, the council members-elect said they had been told by 
Ruth Bennel, executive officer of the county Local Agency Formation Commission, 
that they were not bound by the Brown Act until they are sworn in. The county 
counsel has given the same advice to newly incorporating cities for more than 
20 years, Bennel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spirit of the Law 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, the newspaper acknowledged that the law did not specifically cover 
incorporating cities, but argued that the council had violated the "spirit" of 
the Brown Act by discussing matters, such as the selection of a new mayor and 
interim city manager, behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs would not comment on her ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper has not decided whether to pursue the matter further, Contopulos 
said, but he called on legislators to change the law. "I think it's a real 
problem the Legislature should address, because I think it clearly violates the 
purpose of the act." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor-elect Phyllis Papen said she hoped Monday's ruling would clarify the law 
for the next city that incorporates. Papen stressed that the council never 
sought to conceal its decision-making from the public.

BOARD REJECTS BAN ON ANIMAL SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday rejected a motion that would have 
prohibited the county Department of Animal Care and Control from selling 
animals picked up in Altadena to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who recommended the ban, was not able to get a 
second for his motion. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member town council of unincorporated Altadena, which is in Antonovich's 
district, had unanimously approved a resolution supporting the ban March 21. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being hit with a lead balloon," Altadena resident Rita Bernier said 
of the defeat. Bernier, a former volunteer at the county's Baldwin Park animal 
shelter, had originally brought the issue to the town council. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's press deputy Dawson Oppenheimer said the supervisor was 
disappointed but not surprised because the board has rejected similar measures 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to give up," Bernier said, adding that she was considering 
asking the town council, which has no jurisdiction over the animal control 
operation, to continue to press the Board of Supervisors for a ban. She said it 
was cruel to use animals for experiments and that researchers should use tissue 
cultures or computer models instead. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bernier persuaded the City Council of Bradbury, which is 
served by the Baldwin Park shelter, to adopt a similar resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the 35 cities that contract with the county for animal shelter 
services have approved similar "pet-protection" measures within the past four 
years, said Bruce Richards, assistant director of the county animal control 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Department employees check a computer after animals are brought in to determine 
whether they were picked up in cities covered by a "pet-protection" resolution, 
he said. Those animals are not sold for research. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold animals for seven full days," during which time the animals can be 
claimed by their owners or adopted, he said. After seven days, the animals not 
sold for research are put to death. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95,000 animals the department takes in each year, 20,000 are adopted and 
800 are sold to research centers such as the USC Medical School or the 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, he said. Department figures for 1987-88 show that 
6,764 pets were claimed by their owners.

JAPANESE TO BUY 100% OF RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB, SITE OF L.A. OPEN

<P>
The Riviera Country Club, fashionable site of the Los Angeles Open golf 
tournament, will be bought by the Japanese company that took a 49% interest in 
the club last year. 
</P>
<P>
Marukin Shoji Co. Ltd. has notified the owner of the club frequented by 
Hollywood celebrities that it intends to exercise an option to buy the 
remaining 51% of the Riviera for $55.1 million in cash, the owner said today. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to close by Aug. 31, said LAACO Ltd., which owns the 
Riviera, Los Angeles Athletic Club and the California Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Marukin Shoji paid $52.9 million to buy 49% of the golf and tennis club from 
LAACO in August, 1988. The deal gave the Japanese real estate and construction 
company a one-year option to buy the rest of the 168-acre club on the city's 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has reassured the 1,500 members of the exclusive club that it intends 
to honor current memberships, said Alex Auerbach, a spokesman for Marukin 
Shoji.

The state Assembly today narrowly approved a bill, identical to one vetoed last 
year, that would require all motorcycle riders to wear safety helmets. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 41 to 24, a bare majority of the 80-member house, for AB8 by 
Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Carson). It goes to the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The law now requires helmets to be worn by riders 15 1/2 years old and younger. 
The bill would require all motorcycle riders to wear helmets approved by the 
federal Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Legislature passed an identical Floyd bill, but it was vetoed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian, who said he was concerned "about the need to mandate 
all motorcycle riders and passengers to wear helmets."

House Speaker Jim Wright, choking back tears, said today he never "knowingly or 
intentionally" violated House rules and asked for "the very earliest possible 
opportunity" to answer Ethics Committee charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
In a defiant defense of a lifetime in public life, a feisty Wright vowed to 
defend his wife, Betty, who figures in the allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
She is a "good decent, caring, thoroughly honorable person," Wright said, "and 
I'll damn well fight to protect her honor and integrity from any challenge from 
any source whatever the cost." 
</P>
<P>
There have been charges that his wife did little work for a salary she was paid 
by a Fort Worth business partner of Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's performance signaled his determination to fight aggressively against 
the Ethics Committee charges -- allegations that could ultimately lead to his 
removal as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wright spoke even before a formal announcement of the vote by Democrats and 
Republicans on the Ethics Committee to pursue allegations that he improperly 
accepted gifts from a business partner and tried to evade outside income limits 
through the sale of his books. 
</P>
<P>
He was flanked by a virtual who's who of House Democratic leaders as he 
appeared before reporters. The scene unfolded in the ornate Rayburn Room a few 
steps outside the House chamber -- a hall named for another Texas Democrat who 
rose to become Speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
"I will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that I possess," 
Wright vowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that in the 34 years I have served in the Congress I have not 
violated any of those basic rules or any commonly accepted standard of ethical 
conduct," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to demonstrate that in each of these instances no rule has been 
violated," Wright said of the Ethics Committee charges. 
</P>
<P>
"This House has been my life for more than half of my life," Wright said. "I 
love this institution." 
</P>
<P>
Wright made a detailed defense against the allegations he faces after noting 
that the Ethics Committee had not yet established any proof that he had 
violated the rules or even that there was "clear and convincing evidence" of a 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
The public scene came after a private defense. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Wright, speaking on a highly personal level, told senior House 
Democratic colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he will fight to defend his 
honor following Wednesday's votes in the Ethics Committee, which has been 
investigating his finances for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things worth fighting for, and one of them is personal honor 
and reputation earned over 66 years of living and giving," Wright told 
reporters after the leadership meeting. "And that's far more precious to me 
than any public office." 
</P>
<P>
The last of the ethics decisions were reached Wednesday on strong bipartisan 
votes, according to sources familiar with the panel's probe. The votes mean the 
panel has found "reason to believe" Wright violated a series of House rules, 
and they point toward a new phase of the case that could involve a disciplinary 
hearing and possible punishment.

Charles Lewis, former Virgin Islands official and friend of District of 
Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr., was indicted today on 10 felony counts 
stemming from Barry's visits to his hotel room last December. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury indicted Lewis, who also is facing cocaine possession charges in 
the Virgin Islands, on three counts of cocaine possession and seven counts of 
giving false statements to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The perjury charges center on questions Lewis was asked about visits Barry made 
to his hotel room and what went on there, according to sources close to the 
case.

A car bomb exploded outside a hotel in the northeastern city of Trincomalee 
today, killing at least 38 people and injuring 57 in an attack military 
officials blamed on Tamil rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the blast, a group of angry Sinhalese attacked Tamil residents in 
the city with knives, killing one and injuring seven, military officials in 
Colombo said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion in the port city, 145 miles northeast of Colombo, occurred as 
more than 100 Sinhalese in a marketplace adjacent to the hotel hunted for gifts 
and sweets to celebrate the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The mid-morning blast flattened four neighboring shops, the military officials 
said. Sketchy reports reaching Colombo did not say whether the hotel was still 
standing or how large it was.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl today fired his defense minister and replaced seven 
other Cabinet members in an apparent bid to stop his party's declining 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the defense post, Kohl announced a new chief of staff and new 
ministers for finance, interior, transport, economic cooperation, construction 
and information. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Rupert Scholz was the only Cabinet member left jobless under 
the changes. He was replaced by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said at a news conference that the changes were not a direct consequence 
of his Christian Democratic Union's recent election setbacks, but he conceded 
that his party and coalition government face "a totally new situation."

Formica Corp. announced today it has approved a sweetened merger agreement with 
a management-led investor group which will pay about $365 million in cash for 
the laminated products company. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not allow Formica to accept offers from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
The $19-per-share bid by FM Acquisition Corp. includes the assumption of 
Formica debt. Formica announced Monday that it had rejected a $243-million 
takeover from FM Acquisition, one of several offers made for the company in 
recent months. That offer was $18.75 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Formica also announced today that an unidentified industrial corporation, which 
had reportedly offered $20 per share for the company, has withdrawn its offer.

With the debut of the summer driving season only six weeks away, America's 
refining industry may not be able to produce enough gasoline to meet demand, 
oil industry analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaskan oil spill and a fire at a major West Coast refiner have already cut 
supplies and boosted prices, setting the stage for higher prices by the time 
the Memorial Day weekend arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, average U.S. gasoline retail prices jumped more than 10 cents a 
gallon in the three-week period ended last Friday to $1.1063 a gallon, 
according to Lundberg Survey Inc., a Los Angeles-based consulting firm that 
tracks gasoline prices at 12,000 retail locations. 
</P>
<P>
The price is the highest since 1986 and more than 14.5 cents a gallon above 
prices drivers were paying last year at this time.

CAR SALES UP 26.5% EARLY THIS MONTH DUE TO INCENTIVES

<P>
Big Three auto sales shot up 26.5% in early April, when incentives were in full 
force, compared with last year when the deals had expired, the companies said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler said cars and light trucks sold at an average 
daily rate of 34,931 during the April 1-10 period this year, contrasted with a 
rate of 27,621 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales soared 27.6%, and sales of light trucks were up 24.6% during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Ford and GM announced new incentive packages featuring 2.9% 
interest on two-year loans and increased rebates. Chrysler got into the fray 
April 3, going one step further to interest-free financing on two-year loans 
for all of its cars. 
</P>
<P>
While incentives surely contributed to some of the early April sales boom, some 
of the increase is attributable to slow sales during the period last year. 
Incentives in effect during the first quarter of 1988 expired March 31, 
persuading consumers planning spring or summer purchases to make them earlier.

RETAIL SALES UP SLIM 0.1% IN MARCH AFTER SHARP FEB. DECLINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Retail sales, held back by sluggish business at car dealerships and department 
stores, edged up a slim 0.1% in March after posting a sharp decline during the 
previous month, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $139.42 
billion last month after falling 0.6% in February and rising 0.6% in January. 
The figures are not adjusted to exclude the effects of rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight month, overall sales in March were held down by a 
decline in spending on autos, which account for almost one-fourth of the retail 
total. Car sales were down 0.1% in March after declining 2.5% in February and 
1.9% in January. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that auto sales had declined for three straight months 
since July through September, 1984, when the decreases were more pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
Car makers in recent weeks have launched a new round of incentive programs in 
hopes of luring customers back to showrooms during the prime spring selling 
season despite higher interest rates for loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closely Watched 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the automotive category, retail sales last month still were up just 
0.2% after holding virtually even during February and rising 1.4% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Retail spending accounts for about one-third of overall economic activity and 
is closely watched as a measure of the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are expecting an economic slowdown this year in response to an 
ongoing campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to push up interest rates and 
thus dampen demand and restrain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In the key category of department and other general merchandise stores, sales 
fell 1.2% in March to $15.6 billion after declining 1.5% in February. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report earlier this month, the nation's big retailers reported 
mixed March results, with giant Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. reporting strong sales 
under its new competitive pricing policy while other chains were less pleased 
with last month's showing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Ticket' Items Down 
</P>
<P>
Overall, sales of durable goods, "big ticket" items expected to last three or 
more years, were down 0.2% last month after plunging 1.7% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.3% in March after climbing 0.2% 
during the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Among the categories of goods to report sales increases last month were: food 
and grocery stores, up 0.2%; gasoline service stations, up 0.5%, and bars and 
restaurants, up 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Categories posting declines included building and hardware stores, down 1.9%; 
furniture stores, down 0.2%; clothing and accessory stores, down 0.4%, and 
drugstores, down 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of the year, overall retail sales were up 5.7% from 
the same period in 1988.

Investigations by the Miami Dolphins and the NFL into allegations involving 
Mark Duper uncovered no wrongdoing, and the wide receiver has been reinstated 
and will report to camp next week, Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Duper was suspended last season for violating the league's substance abuse 
policy. Sources quoted in December by Sports Illustrated alleged that Duper had 
ties to a convicted drug dealer and has been a cocaine user since at least 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to substantiate or come up with anything from those 
allegations," Shula said Wednesday. The investigations by security officials 
from the team and the NFL have been concluded, Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Duper plans to report next week for off-season workouts. Because of his 30-day 
suspension last Nov. 30, he will be subject to random drug testing.

ROSE CHECK REPORTED FOUND IN RAID;

A bank check from Cincinnati Reds superstar Pete Rose to a man later convicted 
of bookmaking reportedly was found during a 1984 gambling raid in Bristol 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald and The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin reported today 
that they were told by unidentified sources that Rose bet with the man and gave 
him his 1975 World Series championship ring as payment for a gambling debt. 
Rose got the ring after the Reds beat the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal-Bulletin also said the bookmaker had stayed with the Reds at a 
Florida hotel during spring training and received the team rate. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol County Dist. Atty. Ronald A. Pina has agreed to turn over evidence on 
betting to the baseball commissioner's office, which is investigating 
allegations Rose bet on baseball games, Pina's spokesman Jim Martin told the 
Herald. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the information we have . . . is that, in fact, Pete Rose turned over 
his 1975 World Championship baseball ring . . . to this individual in 
Somerset," the Herald quotes Pina as saying Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald and Journal-Bulletin said they were told that the man involved was 
Joseph Cambra of Somerset, who was convicted on bookmaking charges after the 
1984 raid. Martin would not confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, now manager of the Reds, faces a one-year suspension from baseball if he 
is found to have bet on baseball games. If found to have bet on games involving 
the Reds, he will be suspended for life. 
</P>
<P>
Cambra declined to discuss how he and Rose met, the Journal-Bulletin reported. 
"That's my business," he told reporters who confronted him outside his home 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal-Bulletin also said an unidentified desk clerk at the Holiday Inn in 
Plant City, Fla., confirmed Cambra stayed there from March 18-26 at the team 
rate of $35 a day instead of the regular rate of $65. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said more than 20 people were arrested in November, 1984, as a result of 
the gambling investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said allegations were made during the investigation that Rose, who was still 
playing at the time, placed bets. 
</P>
<P>
One source told the Herald that authorities listening in on hundreds of calls 
intercepted in a court-ordered wiretap never identified Rose as placing bets 
with Cambra by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators reportedly examined the alleged check from Rose to Cambra but 
returned it because it could not be linked directly to the investigation. The 
Journal-Bulletin said a police source told it that the check had been destroyed 
as part of routine procedure.
