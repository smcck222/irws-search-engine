PLEASE PASS THE 'DOLPHIN SAFE' TUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision Thursday by America's three largest purveyors of canned tuna not 
to purchase fish caught in nets that also trap and kill dolphins represents 
more than a victory for conservationists concerned with protecting marine 
mammals. It also signals, in a dramatic fashion, that consumers' willingness to 
vote their environmental convictions at the cash register has become a powerful 
force for good in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 100,000 of the highly intelligent dolphins are killed in the eastern 
Pacific each year by fishermen in pursuit of yellowfin tuna, most of which is 
canned and sold in the United States. Because schools of dolphin and mature 
tuna swim together -- the air-breathing mammals on the surface, the fish below 
-- fishermen sight the dophins and surround them with circular nets, called 
purse seines. As the nets are drawn in, dolphins, as well as tuna, often are 
trapped. The mammals drown if they are held too long beneath the surface. 
American fishermen, whose conduct is regulated by the Marine Mammal Protection 
Act and whose boats carry federal observers, kill fewer than 20,000 dolphins 
each year. The other 80,000 or so are netted by foreign fishermen, mostly Latin 
Americans. Only about 30% of their craft carry U.S. inspectors, and 
environmentalists have criticized the National Marine Fisheries Service for its 
lack of vigor in monitoring non-American fishermen, most of whose catch 
ultimately is sold here. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by H.J. Heinz, parent company of Star-Kist, and the Van Camp 
Seafood company, which markets Chicken of the Sea, and Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. 
means that 70% of the tuna sold in this country can now be labeled "dolphin 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
Heinz's Irish-born chairman, Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, said that his company 
simply was responding to consumer concern and expected the decision actually to 
increase tuna sales, even though the price will increase a few cents per can. 
He said his firm would not only continue its current policy of refusing to 
purchase albacore tuna caught in highly destructive drift nets, but also 
actively support pending federal legislation to require any tuna caught in nets 
that kill marine mammals to be labeled "dolphin unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., one sponsor of the bill, called the 
companies' action "one hell of a sound business decision." So it is, and, as 
such, it marks the end of the era in which some folks in the board room thought 
good business and good environmental policy were mutually exclusive.

DOWN WITH THE MONSTROSITY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not often that a city gets a chance to correct a mistake as big as the 
Embarcadero Freeway, the massive double-decked highway that is one of the few 
eyesores in San Francisco -- a town otherwise famous for its scenery and the 
collective good sense to preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
As originally envisioned by California's mega-builders of the 1950s, the 
Embarcadero was to link the Golden Gate Bridge (U.S. Highway 101) with the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) by cutting along San Francisco's 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Because it would have taken out parts of North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and the 
Marina District along the way, a community uproar halted the project. So the 
freeway now comes to an abrupt end near the city's Financial District and 
Chinatown. Because it blocks inland views of San Francisco Bay and the city's 
historic Ferry Building, the Embarcadero has long been the highway many folks 
in the Bay Area love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Last October's Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the freeway so severely it had to 
be closed. (It did not collapse, thankfully, like another double-decked freeway 
in Oakland.) Now there's a surprisingly fierce debate under way in San 
Francisco over whether the Embarcadero Freeway should be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown's merchants in particular claim business will suffer if inbound 
tourists no longer leave the freeway in their neighborhood. Mayor Art Agnos 
proposes using federal and state money earmarked for repairing the freeway to 
build a wide, tree-lined waterfront boulevard in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Our northern neighbors have done a fine job of preserving their lovely city 
without much advice from us. But in this case -- since out-of-town tourism is 
part of the debate -- we opt for tearing down that Monstrosity by the Bay. 
Chinatown, and the rest of San Francisco's charms, can only be enhanced by its 
removal.

'TO LIVE IN TRUTH'; 
</P>
<P>
* AFTER 50 YEARS, SOVIETS ADMIT THE HORROR OF KATYN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Aquinas held that memory ought to be a branch of ethics. History is a 
people's memory of themselves, and without it they are left to wander soulless 
in a moral wasteland. That is why Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel has 
described the most critical aspect of the popular revolution now under way in 
Eastern Europe as a struggle "to live in truth." 
</P>
<P>
A milestone in the course of that struggle was reached Friday, when the Soviets 
officially acknowledged, for the first time, that in the spring of 1940, Josef 
Stalin's secret police murdered more than 15,000 captured Polish officers in 
their custody. The bodies of 4,250 of them were found in mass graves in the 
Katyn Forest near the western Russian city of Smolensk. Each had been shot in 
the back of the head; their corpses were stacked in layers. The remains of the 
estimated 11,000 Polish internees killed in the camps in Starobielsk and 
Ostashkow never have been found. Soviet apologists have insisted ever since 
that the Poles were killed by invading Nazi troops. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, however, Tass released a statement announcing that Soviet and Polish 
historians had turned up conclusive evidence that the massacres were carried 
out by Stalin's NKVD. "The discovered archival material," Tass said, "puts 
direct responsibility for the atrocities in the Katyn Forest on (secret police 
Chief Lavrenti) Beria, (V. N.) Merkulov and their henchmen. The Soviet side, 
expressing profound regret over the Katyn tragedy, declares that this tragedy 
is one of the gravest crimes of Stalinism." 
</P>
<P>
Poles have long regarded Katyn as a national and not simply human disaster. The 
15,000 murdered officers represented the cream of the Polish intelligentsia, 
called up from the reserves in 1939. Stalin thought the elimination of such 
"class enemies" would destroy the Poles' national spirit and will to resist. 
Such is the calculus of tyranny, and the Soviets' willingness to speak honestly 
of it now, even as they confront wrenching nationalist turmoil within their own 
borders, says much about the changes Mikhail S. Gorbachev has brought to the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, in those first dark months of 1940, when barbarism appeared 
everywhere triumphant, spring must have seemed a mockery. Today, the season of 
promise and the lives of nations are once again conjoined, as the green shoots 
of hope and truth push their way to the light, even in the dark soil of Katyn.

<P>
I don't find it difficult to accept that water rationing is in our immediate 
future, perhaps, even, for all time hereafter. 
</P>
<P>
However, I will oppose, with all the conviction I can muster, the granting of 
additional building permits -- both residential and commercial -- so long as 
the rationing of water is deemed necessary for those of us who occupy existing 
dwelling units. 
</P>
<P>
The granting of new building permits will only exacerbate the water shortage: 
Every additional dwelling unit will be allowed to consume -- without penalty -- 
the water "saved" by nine existing consumers who reduce their consumption by 
the proposed mandatory 10%. 
</P>
<P>
That's not just unfair. It is simply unconscionable for the City Council and 
the Department of Water and Power to allow those new water connections.

I wonder if the Grand Old Party would have demonstrated the same compassion

election if they found out that any of them had experimented with drugs at some 
time in their life.

According to Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), "Ryan's generation of Americans is now 
emerging into top leadership positions in the government." If you follow that 
train of thought, then Timothy Leary should be President of the U.S.

COUNCILMAN'S ABILITY TO SERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the recent article (Metro, April 1) concerning the physical condition 
of Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, followed by your editorial (April 3) urging him 
to resign: 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, after only a brief convalescence, returned to regular attendance at 
the City Council, but on a reduced schedule prescribed by his doctor to aid his 
more rapid recovery. Gil has now completed the first phase of his post-stroke 
therapy, and is soon to commence a second phase, which it is predicted will 
restore him to nearly his pre-stroke vigor. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of some, publicly and privately, to Gil's current disability, has 
varied. Understandably, there are those who have been waiting in the wings for 
many years as he has passed his 70th birthday, then his 80th, and now 
approaches his 90th, waiting for him to retire to open the seat for "new 
blood." To those the disabilities caused by his stroke give an opening to 
demand his resignation now which may become moot if he continues to improve 
through his new therapy. They tend to lay aside the fact that the road back 
from stroke is difficult, and is not traveled in a day. 
</P>
<P>
We should not be so ready to abandon those of advanced age who have served so 
well for so long as Gil has and who still has the ability to recover to the 
point of nearly full participation. 
</P>
<P>
There is another point to be made as well, which has to do with the word 
"democracy," the right of the people to choose their own representatives, and 
the duty of the chosen to serve. In 1988 Gil suffered his stroke. In 1989 there 
was an election in the 9th District, and Gil's opponents made a major point of 
the disability caused by his stroke. Gil won overwhelming reelection to a term 
that lasts until July 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Lindsay is the elected representative of the people of the 9th District, 
and he has not only the right but the duty to remain in office for the balance 
of his term.

RYAN WHITE'S BATTLE AGAINST IGNORANCE, AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The life struggle and death of Ryan White inspires everyone, touches everyone 
and silences one and all with respect. He is a genuine hero. 
</P>
<P>
My comments are directed to the multitude of sad-eyed newscasters and 
hypocritical politicians who made such a point of mourning this particular 
victim of AIDS. I am appalled by the double standard of compassion exhibited by 
the public. No, Ryan White never "deserved" what he got and he fought 
valiantly. Remember, however, he is one of the hundreds of thousands who have 
gone "quickly into the night." Many victims of AIDS have had to keep their 
affliction a secret. Inevitably, they lost their jobs, their homes and most 
died without family near them. 
</P>
<P>
How dare you, Joe Public, cry for only Ryan White! He was safe to mourn! Mourn 
for those dying daily, their deaths hastened by cancelled insurance, 
exorbitant, unreachable black-market drug prices and a federal policy that 
ignored the existence of AIDS because it was considered a "homosexual" disease. 
</P>
<P>
We need a federal policy cognizant and sympathetic to the realities of testing 
HIV positive. And we all need to let the compassion and spirit that brings us 
together to mourn the passing of Ryan White open our eyes and hearts to the 
harsh reality of dying going on around us daily.

Rationing the user is not the answer. Conservation at the beginning of the

</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of all the rain that falls on Los Angeles County runs off and 
immediately ends up in the Pacific Ocean. We must stop this wasteful run-off 
and collect this precious commodity. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that a cost analysis of the necessary infrastructure changes and 
construction to collect our rainwater would prove this to be the most 
cost-effective method of increasing the water supply.

What I find most disturbing in your article on California's drought (front 
page, April 1) is that the officials at MWD seem to be surprised that we are 
running short of water. 
</P>
<P>
For years now MWD has been openly supportive of the extraordinary growth in 
Southern California as though there was an unlimited supply of water. 
</P>
<P>
Never once have they suggested that we should limit our growth to ensure that 
we have an adequate supply of water to meet future demand. Even now when they 
are on the verge of rationing water, MWD officials are still not suggesting 
that we attempt to plan California's growth. 
</P>
<P>
At our present growth rate, this year's 12% water shortage is equivalent to the 
amount of water that three years of Southern California's growth uses. After 
the 1977 drought if our water officials had recommended that we start planning 
our growth instead of just accommodating it, we would not be facing the severe 
water shortage we are today.

When is a crisis -- a crisis -- a crisis? 
</P>
<P>
When there's no more water at all! 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Supervisors and Mayor Tom Bradley should issue an 
immediate order for a moratorium to become effective not later than May 15 on 
all building and construction that will have water hook-ups of any type. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptions would be those that are within 90% of completion by May 15 and have 
an OK for water and sewage hook-ups. 
</P>
<P>
If the rainfall exceeds normal levels in our vital areas of water supply -- 
namely Mono Basin and Shasta Lake regions -- then and only then should the 
moratorium be lifted in 1991.

I finally figured out how the NCAA tournament selection process works, and what 
a shame for Joe Harrington and his brave Long Beach State 49ers.

All they had to do to get an invitation was beat the eventual NCAA champion 
UNLV in the Big West tournament and they blew it. They could manage only to 
keep up with the Runnin' Rebels for a half. Still, that's 20 more minutes than 
Duke did.

He sits in the front row, next to the opposing team's coach. Half the time he 
has a better seat than Magic. Hey, Jack, I love you. I root for you every time 
I see "The Shining," but could you please pass those suckers up to the top, 
where someone with bad eyes can see the game?

LET REBELS ENJOY THEIR TITLE . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the sanctimonious stance of the NCAA infractions committee, there seems 
to be an arbitrarily punitive and perhaps vengeful motive pertaining to its 
investigation of UNLV's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Leaking damaging rumors about schools to the media before the competition of an 
investigation is tantamount to lynching. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has done so with UNLV, thereby disrupting its program and discouraging 
athletes to join the school for fear of possible retributions by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian should be accountable for any misdeed he perpetrates, but first he 
should be proven guilty. It behooves the NCAA to exercise fairness in its own 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
ARMEN GOENJIAN, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: Tarkanian was, indeed, found guilty of recruiting violations by 
the NCAA in 1977, and UNLV was ordered to suspend him for two years. Tarkanian 
took the case to court, where it dragged on for nearly 12 years before the 
Supreme Court decided, in late 1988, that the NCAA had such a right. Recently, 
Tarkanian and the NCAA settled out of court, but another possible recruiting 
violation by Tarkanian has been under investigation by the NCAA since 1987.

It is now very evident why Mike Downey understands so little about the game of 
baseball. Instead of watching the Atlanta Braves play the sport on TBS, he's 
busy critiquing the commercials. Downey should stick to covering college 
basketball and leave the national pastime to the real writers.

It's too bad that a young man died, but try to look at it objectively: Gathers

He could have settled for the million-dollar insurance policy and a normal

If there is still anyone who thinks the Kings made a horrible deal in trading

Contrary to what most of the critics have been muttering, it will probably go 
down as the second-best trade in Kings' history. (If you have to ask what the 
first was, then you probably don't have an opinion to begin with.)

HOCKEY STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
RANGERS USE GARTNER'S HAT TRICK TO MAKE ISLANDERS DISAPPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Gartner came out of his slump Friday night, and the New York Rangers 
became the first team in the Wales Conference to get to the second round of the 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Gartner, a sharpshooting right wing, was scoreless in the first four games, 
then had a hat trick at Uniondale, N.Y., to lead the Rangers to a 6-5 victory 
over the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers won the series, 4 games to 1. 
</P>
<P>
His third goal was the clincher. The Islanders had battled back from a 
three-goal deficit to cut the lead to 5-4 on a goal by Randy Wood with 8:42 
left. But on a power-play only 26 seconds later, Gartner scored the goal that 
won it. 
</P>
<P>
The clincher came on the 50th anniversary of the last Stanley Cup championship 
the Rangers won, in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders, buoyed by the return of Pat LaFontaine and Jeff Norton from 
concussions suffered earlier in the bitterly-fought series, battled all the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
LaFontaine set up Norton for the Islanders' first goal, but after John 
Ogrodnick tied the score, 2-2, on a power play late in the third period, the 
Islanders were never in front again. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers will play the winner of the New Jersey-Washington series. The 
Capitals hold a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, New Jersey 3 -- The Devils knew the way to beat the Capitals in 
Game 5 at East Rutherford, N.J., was to stop high-scoring Dino Ciccarelli. 
</P>
<P>
So they hounded, checked and tackled the Capitals' star most of the night. With 
these tactics, the Devils built a 2-1 lead after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
But Ciccarelli broke free from the smothering defense to lead the Capitals, who 
now lead the best-of-seven series, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the faceoff to start the last period, Ciccarelli had an assist on 
Mike Ridley's goal that tied it at 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The next time on the ice, Ciccarelli created his own scoring opportunity. He 
stole the puck just outside the Devils' zone and worked hockey's version of the 
give-and-go with teammate Kelly Miller. Miller gave the puck back to 
Ciccarelli, who swung at the airborne puck like a baseball hitter and swatted 
the puck into the net. 
</P>
<P>
When Geoff Courtnall scored with three minutes left, it made the final New 
Jersey score just before the end meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will play the sixth game Sunday at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, Hartford 2 -- The Bruins, still without injured defensive star Ray 
Bourque, won this game at Boston on a big play by Cam Neely. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, while the Bruins were killing a penalty, intercepted goaltender Peter 
Sidorkiewicz's clearing pass and put a 25-foot blast into the net for a 
short-handed goal, and that was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Brian Propp and Neely scored on power plays to give the Bruins seven 
in the series on 24 tries. The Whalers, who trail the series, 3-2, have only 
two power-play goals in 26 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The last period was a 20-minute roughhouse in which there were only nine shots 
on goal, five by the Whalers, who couldn't get the tying shot past goalie Andy 
Moog. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Buffalo 2 -- The Canadiens are playing better on the road than they 
are at home, so they lead the series, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring star Stephane Richer scored two more goals and the Canadiens improved 
their record at Buffalo in this series to 2-1. Richer has six goals in five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens can clinch the best-of-seven series with a victory Sunday at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo twice took one-goal leads. The second time, Rick Vaive's goal made it 
2-1 midway through the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Smith tied the score at 17:13 of the period and a little over a minute 
later Richer's second goal put Montreal ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres continued to battle for a tying goal, getting 12 shots on goal in 
the last period, but Russ Courtnall ended their hopes with an empty-net goal.

HAWKS HELP PLAYOFF CHANCES BY BEATING PISTONS 
</P>

<P>
Are the Detroit Pistons beginning to feel the pressure that has made it so 
difficult for NBA champions to repeat? 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Hawks, fighting to earn a spot in the playoffs, came into the 
Palace at Auburn Hills, Mich., on Friday night and defeated the Pistons, 
115-111. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks' Dominique Wilkins scored 25 points and made a key defensive play as 
the Pistons lost for the sixth time in 11 games. Detroit's Central Division 
lead is two games over Chicago. Those teams meet in the final game of the 
season at Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
With Atlanta leading, 113-111, with five seconds left, the Pistons were trying 
to set up a tying basket. Wilkins intercepted a pass by Isiah Thomas, was 
fouled and made both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I laid back and hoped he would pass it to the outside, and when he did I 
jumped out and took control of it," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Hawks into the final playoff spot in the Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very big win for our team against the world champions," Atlanta Coach 
Mike Fratello said. "We can't afford to lose anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons were called for seven technical fouls, three for illegal defense. 
</P>
<P>
"(The officials) called it as they saw it," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. 
"It's their decision, they're the law. They made quite a few zone calls, and 
that was interesting." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was only the fifth in 38 home games for the Pistons, who were 27-0 at 
the Palace when scoring 100 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to let the division title get away," said James Edwards, who led 
the Pistons with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 116, Milwaukee 106 -- Michael Jordan had 26 points and 10 assists at 
Chicago and the Bulls raced to their ninth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls improved their home record to 34-5. They trail by two games overall 
and only one game in the loss column with six games to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Pierce had 22 points and Greg Anderson 20 for the Bucks, who need a 
victory to clinch a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be great to win the division, and we will give it our best shot," 
Jordan said. "We see the Pistons within striking distance." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 117, Orlando 102 -- Tyrone Corbin had 36 points and 19 rebounds at 
Minneapolis as the Timberwolves handed the Magic their 11th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell had 27 points and former UCLA standout Pooh Richardson had 26 for 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 124, Dallas 92 -- Clyde Drexler played less than three quarters at 
Portland but scored 22 points to lead the Trail Blazers. DAN HAFNER

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
SHARP HORSES ABOUND IN SUNDAY'S $200,000 FEATURE FOR FILLIES, MARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finding the sharp horses in Sunday's $200,000 Santa Anita Budweiser Breeders' 
Cup is an easy task. Six of the eight entrants are coming off victories, 
another was second in her last start, and the other was fourth, beaten all of a 
length. 
</P>
<P>
But as a consequence of this, isolating which of the fillies and mares will win 
the mile turf race is a more difficult chore. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it wouldn't be surprising to see any of them in the winner's circle 
after the stake is run for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably, Saros Brig is the sharpest of the group. The 6-year-old Saros mare 
has won two consecutive races for Dominick Manzi. After a 9-1 upset of Royal 
Touch and Nikishka in the Buena Vista Handicap on Feb. 25 at Santa Anita, Saros 
Brig went wire to wire in the Golden Poppy at Golden Gate two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of three of her last four starts, she will again be ridden by Pat 
Valenzuela, and speed horses have been faring well in recent weeks on the Santa 
Anita turf course. 
</P>
<P>
Given time off after she wilted in the San Gorgonio Handicap in early January, 
Stylish Star returned on March 24 and won the Las Cienegas Handicap. Victorious 
in four of her 12 turf starts, the 4-year-old Our Native filly has come back 
with two solid works for Dan Hendricks since her sprint victory, and one mile 
seems an ideal distance for her. 
</P>
<P>
Like Saros Brig, Run to Jenny enters Sunday's contest with a two-race win 
streak. Third in a Group I event in Ireland last year, the 4-year-old has been 
impressive in her two U.S. starts, but she hasn't had much behind her. She beat 
a weak field of males on March 9, then returned to outrun her own sex in an 
allowance contest 19 days later. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she fits very nicely with these," jockey Gary Stevens said. "The 
competition is obviously a lot different than what she has faced, but I have a 
lot of confidence in her. Those two races were very easy on her. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confident that she could beat the boys in that condition, and she just 
played with them. In her last race, I only had to let her run the last 50 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"She was kind of crazy (in Europe), but she's been very willing to train and 
has been very kind in the afternoon. On the track, she acts like a pony." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Jackson, who trains Run to Jenny for owner Jack Munari, also thinks she 
belongs in this field. 
</P>
<P>
"She looks like she fits," he said. "I guess we'll find out Sunday. I'm sure 
she's run against this kind or better in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Fieldy was fourth in the aforementioned Santa Ana and the well-traveled 
7-year-old mare was finishing best of all. She has won 14 of 44 races on the 
turf for trainer Tom Skiffington while earning almost $805,000. Some might 
think a mile is too short for her, but she won the Joe Namath at Gulfstream 
Park in January at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
The field also includes Formidable Lady, who was second to Saros Brig in the 
Golden Poppy but is perfect in two starts on the Santa Anita grass; Reluctant 
Guest, who beat allowance rivals on March 21; Petalia, who overcame a terrible 
beginning to win her first start in about 10 months, and Fantastic Look, who 
has won two straight on the dirt for Gary Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for her near-upset of Open Mind in the Alabama at Saratoga last 
August, Dearly Loved makes her California debut today in the $81,975 Santa 
Lucia Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the main track. 
</P>
<P>
Freshened since running third in the Tattling Handicap on Dec. 3, the 
4-year-old Raise a Native filly is now in Charlie Whittingham's barn and will 
be ridden by Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked her three times and I think she's a freak," said the rider who has 
wrapped up his third Santa Anita title. "I've talked to Charlie and (assistant 
trainer) Rodney (Rash), and they said she's a lot more settled. When she got 
here, she was real nervous and skinny. She was wound real tight. She's settled 
now and she's put on a lot of weight." 
</P>
<P>
A restricted stakes, the Santa Lucia also attracted Voila, Fortunate Flyer, 
Cascading Gold, Sugarplum Gal, Tis Juliet, Carita Tostada and Lady Brunicardi, 
who finished in a deadheat for second behind Vive in this race last year. 
</P>
<P>
Apprentice Omar Berrio scored the first two victories of his career Friday at 
Santa Anita. Unfortunately, for him, only one of them counted. 
</P>
<P>
After riding Fit to Run to a 47-1 surprise in the first race, Berrio, 21, saw 
his number come down in a disqualification that had a lot of people scratching 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Berrio came back in the sixth race, split horses and got Perfectly 
Taylor up for a $49 upset. No doubt, there were some anxious moments for him 
again because the inquiry sign was posted after jockey Robbie Davis claimed 
foul. This time, however, the stewards ruled in Berrio's favor. Instead, they 
disqualified Flying Vamp and Eddie Delahoussaye, who had finished third, and 
placed them sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the first race, Fit to Run had gotten the better of favored Roger's Trick in 
mid-stretch. The Run of Luck filly did veer in toward the rail, and Corey 
Nakatani, on Roger's Trick, took up sharply, an action some thought was 
executed a bit too dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Roger's Trick finished second and was going to stay there if 
nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse was still in there, she wasn't out of the heel-clipping stage," said 
steward Pete Pedersen in explaining why Fit to Run was disqualified. "The rider 
had to take up for five strides, and in an instance where danger is involved, 
we take the position to disqualify. 
</P>
<P>
"In our judgment, the potential chance of an accident was significant, and we 
couldn't excuse it." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham won a race on his 77th birthday Friday when Tartas, 
making his first U.S. start, defeated Neskimo in the fifth race. . . . For the 
second straight day, nobody was able to hit the Pick Six, so there's a 
carryover of $248,406.55 today. On a mandatory payout day in the Pick Nine, two 
tickets had six winners and each paid $249,791.60. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect is the 124-pound highweight of the 13 horses given invitations 
for the San Juan Capistrano a week from Sunday. Then come Hawkster, with 123; 
El Senor, with 121; Ten Keys, with 118; Brown Bess, Live the Dream, Colway 
Rally and Super May, with 116 apiece; Delegant, with 115; Just as Lucky, with 
113, and Maceo, Santangelo and Valdali, with 112 each.

<P>
PROPONENTS OF A MISUNDERSTOOD SPORT BATTLE TO IMPROVE THE GAME'S WIMPY IMAGE 
WHILE TRYING TO FIND A DECENT PLACE TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Newmark tells a story about a famous Hollywood producer who answered the 
question, Is there paddle tennis after death? 
</P>
<P>
The producer's Beverly Hills estate came equipped with a paddle-tennis court. 
Every week for years, he played doubles with the same bunch of guys. When he 
died, he made sure the game went on without him. 
</P>
<P>
"In his will, he specified that we could play paddle tennis on his court as 
long as we wanted," says Newmark, who lives in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Newmark, a 63-year-old former California doubles champion, considers himself 
lucky to have friends with private courts. In Los Angeles, if a player lives 
outside Venice, finding a convenient public paddle-tennis court is almost 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Take away the 11 courts at Venice Beach and there are only a handful of public 
courts in the entire L.A. area, probably none in your neighborhood. In the 
Valley area, the only public courts in good shape are the two at the Racquet 
Centre in Studio City. The three courts at North Hollywood High are in 
disrepair and the one at Granada Hills Park doesn't have a net. There are no 
courts in county parks in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Why so few public courts in a town that produces almost all of the great 
paddle-tennis players in the world? That's one of the many puzzling questions 
about paddle tennis, America's most misunderstood sport. Despite being around 
for nearly a century, it has yet to imprint its image into the American 
consciousness. If anything, people are more confused than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Ask around at the office and this is what you usually get: 
</P>
<P>
"Paddle tennis? It's like table tennis and paddle ball. I think in the East 
they call it deck tennis and play it on a wooden platform." 
</P>
<P>
"They play it in a chicken-wire cage." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that the game that old, bald, infirm guys play at the beach?" 
</P>
<P>
Tell them that paddle-tennis is almost exactly like tennis. The rules are about 
the same. But the playing surface is only 20 by 50 feet, a little more than a 
third the size of a tennis court; the net is only 31 inches high; there are no 
walls or chicken wire; hard-birch paddles weighing about 16 ounces can whack a 
forehand drive upwards of 90 m.p.h.; and the ball is served underhanded, almost 
eliminating faults. 
</P>
<P>
The ball used in paddle tennis also creates a lot of confusion. It is a regular 
tennis ball that has been punctured by a hypodermic needle to let the pressure 
out (try explaining that at the office). But the deadening effect gives a 
player more control of the ball coming off his paddle than a tennis player has 
with a lively ball on a string racket. The result is a game that is easier than 
tennis to learn and to play well. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike tennis players, paddle-tennis players like to dress down, perhaps 
because of the beach's influence on the game. And the strict etiquette that is 
required in tennis is almost completely ignored. Sol Hauptman, who has won 14 
of the last 15 national doubles titles, is renowned for screaming -- at 
teammates -- during matches. Tournaments get nasty -- players have been known 
to purposely smash overhands at opponents' torsoes from point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
At its highest levels, paddle tennis is played at the net, fast and furious, 
the players only a few feet apart, cracking volleys at one another with 
dizzying speed. Because of the lack of courts, doubles is the preferred game. 
Age has little to do with ability. Newmark, at 63, can hold his own in a 
friendly game with top players, and he plays regularly with a 76-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Culver City-based U. S. Paddle Tennis Assn. -- the sport's 
governing body -- only an estimated 200,000 people in the country regularly 
play paddle tennis, and half live in the L. A. area. No one is quite sure 
whether Americans aren't playing paddle tennis because there are no courts or 
there are no courts because Americans aren't playing. But it's evident that the 
image problem doesn't help. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't understand the sport," says Barry Zelner, an attorney and a 
highly regarded open-class player. 
</P>
<P>
Like Newmark's Hollywood producer, Zelner has solved the court-shortage problem 
by building one in his Tarzana back yard. And like most dyed-in-the-wool 
players, he's passionate, almost evangelical, about the game. "It just amazes 
me that more people don't play," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A former tennis teaching pro, Zelner didn't play paddle tennis until he entered 
a tournament at the Racquet Center about eight years ago. He and his partner 
used a pair of ancient Marcraft PT-90 paddles, circa 1950. Somehow, they came 
in third and "I haven't hardly played tennis since," says Zelner, who teamed 
with Newmark to win the California A-class title in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, a bright yellow glow spills over the palm trees in his 
neighborhood as Zelner bangs paddle-tennis balls on his lighted court. He is 
playing with Newmark, '89 U. S. doubles runner-up Lance Tepper, and a man so 
far in over his head that he prefers not to be identified. The game is doubles, 
which Tepper considers "three times as fast as singles and more fun." 
</P>
<P>
The games on Zelner's court get combative but never sink to the level of 
competitiveness found in tournaments. In the 90-minute, sweat-inducing workout, 
Tepper and Zelner, both of whom can launch rockets off their paddles, 
graciously hit balls slow enough to be returned, and Newmark doesn't direct as 
many volleys at the feet of the inexperienced player as he could. Tepper lets 
it slip that "we were going about one-quarter speed." 
</P>
<P>
Inside Zelner's Southwest-influenced house, they sit around talking about 
paddle tennis. With them are Zelner's wife, Lori; their son, Brian, an 
8-year-old who hits a mean forehand; and Shasta, a golden retriever who fetches 
errant shots during games. 
</P>
<P>
Lori also plays paddle tennis, preferring singles. When she drives around the 
Valley, she says, she always notices paddle-tennis courts in back yards and one 
day wants to organize their owners into a Valley league. An advocate of the 
sport, she comes to its defense if she hears anyone disparage it. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry's uncle has a tennis court in his back yard and he's always putting down 
paddle tennis, calling it 'walking Ping-Pong,' " Lori says. "He thinks it's so 
easy. 'Give me a chance at you,' I tell him. 'You'll find out.' "

AGOURA FIRST BASEMAN SIGNS TO PLAY AT NO. 1 ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura High's Brian Smith has signed a national letter of intent to play 
baseball at Arizona State in the fall. Smith, a 6-foot-5 infielder/pitcher who 
is batting .353, has been limited to six games this season because of a broken 
bone in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, an All-Frontier League selection who hit .449 last year, also visited UC 
Santa Barbara. He chose Arizona State, whose team is ranked first in the nation 
by Baseball America, after a January visit. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who signed Wednesday, canceled visits to USC and UCLA. The Sun Devils 
recruited him as a first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ask for anything more in a program," Smith said.

LIEBERTHAL HITS 2 HOMERS TO KEY PAIR OF WESTLAKE VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westlake High's Mike Lieberthal hit two home runs and drove in seven runs 
Friday to lead the Warriors to two wins in the Chaparral tournament in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, a senior catcher who has signed to play with Arizona State, was two 
for three and hit a three-run home run as Westlake beat Basic of Nevada, 14-3, 
in its first game of the day. Lieberthal added a grand slam in an 11-6 win over 
Serra of California. The games were limited to six and five innings because of 
a time limit. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal's 10th and 11th home runs of the year give him the lead among area 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, which lost for the first time this season in its tournament-opening 
game Thursday, amassed 19 hits and improved to 17-1. Westlake entered the 
tournament as the top-ranked Southern Section 5-A Division team. 
</P>
<P>
"We started slow in both games, but rose to the occasion when we had to," 
Westlake Coach Rich Herrera said. "You could hear the guys in the dugout 
saying, 'Hey, we can't get beat again' " 
</P>
<P>
Against Basic, Westlake erupted for six runs in the third inning and added 
eight in the sixth. Keith Hess was two for three and hit his fourth home run, 
and James Jones drove in four runs. Mike Eby, a senior left-hander who has 
signed a letter of intent with UCLA, allowed seven hits and improved to 6-0. 
Eby is within one win of tying the school record for wins in a season, which 
was set in 1987 by John Chiaramonte. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Rob Neal was three for four with a triple, and Rick Wolters 
added two hits for the Warriors, who committed seven errors and allowed five 
unearned runs. Lieberthal's grand slam, his seventh homer in nine days, 
highlighted a four-run fifth that allowed Westlake to extend a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Bonanza 6, Simi Valley 4 -- Simi Valley rallied for two runs in the 
seventh inning on Aaron Fischer's two-run single, but the Pioneers' four errors 
proved costly in a second-round game in the Chaparral tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer was three for four with a double, and Jeff Sommer and Tyler Nelson each 
had two hits for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Hood had his hitting streak snapped at 19 games, one short of tying the 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Clark 11, Simi Valley 7 -- Aaron Fischer, John Sawyer and Darryl 
Hernandez each had two hits for Simi Valley (8-8), which used 19 players. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley 11, Las Vegas Bishop Gorman 0 -- B. J. Petersen and Rick 
Nickols combined on a six-hitter, and Matt Chaffin pounded two doubles to lift 
the Antelopes (6-9) in the third round of the Chaparral tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley 3, La Salle 2 -- With the Antelopes leading, 2-0, in the second 
inning, Chad Eberhart doubled home Tony Abrams with what proved to be the 
decisive run. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood 14, Avalon 4 -- Nat Perlof hit two home runs in one inning to lead 
Oakwood (5-2, 2-1) in a Liberty League game at Avalon. Perlof hit a two-run 
homer and a three-run blast to key a nine-run fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS' BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Mid Valley ARC 61, Team Los Angeles 39 -- Mid Valley advanced to the final of

Photo, Putting in His Two Cents: Tom Shelley of West Hills was among an 
estimated 35 pickets who marched outside the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan office 
in Sherman Oaks on Friday, a day shy of the one-year anniversary of the 
S&amp;L's seizure by federal regulators. Many of the demonstrators, along with 
another group in Tustin, carried signs demanding their money back and chanted 
slogans that recommended harsh punishment for Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman 
of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent. The bailout of the thrift is 
likely to be the nation's costliest, with the cleanup bill put at $2 billion. 
The S&amp;L's collapse also means that more than 22,000 investors who bought 
American Continental bonds, many at Lincoln branches, now hold virtually 
worthless paper. MEL MELCON/For The Times

'VIDEOS' AND DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning columnist Howard Rosenberg's criticism of "America's Funniest Home 
Videos" as a danger to children (March 24 and April 9): 
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant in epidemiology at UCLA I've been involved with a study 
on mild brain injuries in children. For nearly a year I visited emergency rooms 
looking for such cases, typically resulting from play activities -- the stuff 
of "funny home videos." 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't be surprised if many of the children in the clips shown on TV ended 
up in an emergency room with the symptoms of a mild brain injury or concussion. 
I know because I've reviewed hundreds of ER charts. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg did well to point out that each clip ends at the point of impact. 
What happens afterward?

SANITARIUM REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly released Dudley Moore movie "Crazy People" lampoons the very serious 
subject of mental health and the patients in mental health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Funny? Is it funny when 20-year-olds break down in drug-induced psychosis? Or 
when no one ever comes to visit them? Or when someone such as myself, whose 
only "crime" is to have a trashy home and too many pet cats, is put inside the 
"bin" and exposed to violent, screaming patients? 
</P>
<P>
The horror is still in existence, no matter the claims that the "cuckoo's nest" 
has been improved. I would suggest a boycott of "Crazy People" if the situation 
in mental hospitals isn't changed. 
</P>

 Johnson, the subject of a column by Doug Smith in the Times Glendale section,

FACES . . . : WARFIELD LIVES A DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am in the dream-come-true part of my life now," proclaims Marsha Warfield. 
"Who wouldn't want to be me?" 
</P>
<P>
Probably most performers would love to be in Warfield's shoes these days. The 
acerbic stand-up comic stars as the caustic bailiff, Roz Russell, on NBC's 
long-running sitcom "Night Court," and hosts her own NBC daytime talk series, 
"The Marsha Warfield Show." 
</P>
<P>
Humor, not sensationalism, is the cornerstone of Warfield's show, which airs 
Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. on KNBC Channel 4. Each day, Warfield 
discusses a topic with her studio audience and two celebrity guests. Since its 
premiere, Whoopi Goldberg and Catherine Oxenberg have chatted about 
"Celebrities and Tabloids"; Jackee and Lorenzo Lamas offered their opinions on 
"Is It OK to Borrow a Man?" and Zsa Zsa Gabor discussed "Does Everyone Have to 
Be Skinny?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oprah, Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael all do a great show," says Warfield, 
"but they are journalists. For me to do a journalism show would be bogus. We 
had to do what we do best, which is comedy -- taking another look at the same 
issues we all face and seeing if it's as bad as it seems. If they tell us on TV 
that 20 people got killed last night, they don't tell us that 7 million people 
got home and had dinner and nothing happened to them." 
</P>
<P>
NBC has a 13-week commitment to the series, which premiered March 26. Warfield 
says she's personally committed to the show forever. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, confesses Warfield, where else could she meet and talk with her idols. 
"Smokey Robinson was on the show," she recalls. "I have been in love with 
Smokey since I was born. If I could have married Smokey Robinson at any point 
in my life, I would not be in show business. He sang 'I'll Try Something New' 
to me and I almost cried. That's what it's all about for me -- it's better than 
the money." SUSAN KING

FACES . . . : A 'BIG DAY' FOR SLATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't think my agents tell me when plays come up," jokes Helen Slater, who's 
taking a break from her busy film and TV schedule to play nervous bride Moey 
Bowes in Douglas McGrath's new comedy, "The Big Day," opening next Sunday at 
the Pasadena Playhouse. "I get to fall apart and be emotional," says the 
actress, 26, who's married in real life to film editor Rob Watzke. "There's 
also a big surprise, but I'm not allowed to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Slater's other projects are less secretive. The film "Happy Together," in which 
she stars opposite Patrick Dempsey as mismatched college roomies, opens locally 
on May 4. After "The Big Day," she's off to Texas to film the dark comedy "In 
Deep," playing a lawyer who gets romantically involved with her client, a black 
man. And she's just made her TV debut on the new ABC series "Capital News," as 
bright-eyed, bushy-tailed cub reporter Anne McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
Research for that role included hanging out with a Times Metro writer and 
talking with reporters at the Washington Post, on which the series is loosely 
based. "I think it's amazing," she says of the journalist's life. "As a 
reporter, you have carte blanche to ask any question. And you'd have to have an 
unusually pessimistic nature to be constantly dealing with deception. I think 
it would be wearing after awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Born on Long Island, raised in Maryland and Manhattan, Slater attended New 
York's prestigious High School for the Performing Arts -- before Hollywood 
beckoned with roles in "Supergirl," "The Legend of Billie Jean," "Ruthless 
People" and "The Secret of My Success." As for acting, "I love doing it . . . 
but 80% of the time you're not working. My real desire is to return to school 
and get a degree. If I could choose any career in the world? I think I'd be an 
elementary school teacher." JANICE ARKATOV

MIXED RESULTS IN LONG BEACH VERSION OF 'COWARDY CUSTARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cowardy Custard," at Long Beach's Studio Theatre, is new to the West Coast. 
But it may look familiar to anyone who caught "Oh Coward!" in one of its local 
incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
These collections of songs, brief sketches and other reflections from the pen 
of Sir Noel Coward are much like each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Cowardly" begins with a rush of truncated solos, none of which has time to 
make much of an impression. But the show catches its breath as the first half 
goes on. It finally catches some real laughs in a rendition of "Mad About the 
Boy," with verses sung consecutively by four disparate women characters, all of 
them watching their idol in a movie theater. And certainly you've got to give 
credit to any show that precedes intermission with a number titled "Why Must 
the Show Go On?" 
</P>
<P>
The second half begins with a rousing selection of music-hall numbers, 
suggesting a lower, heartier class than the drawing room habitues we usually 
associate with Coward. Some of these songs are sentimental ditties about 
London, but the sentiment disappears in the next, strategically placed number, 
"There Are Bad Times Just Around the Corner," the lyrics of which belie the 
spirit of the melody. It's Coward at his wittiest. 
</P>
<P>
The show was assembled by Gerald Frow, Alan Strachan and Wendy Toye and first 
presented in London in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
This cast is best in the group numbers, most of them adroitly directed by Kent 
Johnson and choreographed by Roberta Kay. Carole Best's robust voice and 
presence are especially memorable, and Alan Wager projects the slightly frantic 
focus of a young social climber who hasn't quite made it to his destination. 
But a couple of the men look too juvenile for Coward's worldly lyrics, and a 
couple of the women sound excessively fluttery on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Musical director D. Jay Bradley not only provides most of the expert piano 
accompaniment but also steps in to play Coward. He doesn't look much like 
Coward, but he speaks and carries himself with a debonair bearing that's in the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
A glittery strip across the step at the center of the stage looks too 
meretricious for Coward. The costumes were coordinated (not designed) by Ryk 
del Campo, but a few of them are trite or puzzling. A Nehru jacket and 
miniskirt in a song called "Beatnik Love Affair" suggest the wrong decade. And 
the cast got carried away with looking quaint in the music-hall medley. 
</P>

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: RHINO RECORDS' ALBUM OF WWII MORALE BOOSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Songs That Got Us Through WWII," an 18-song album from Rhino Records, is a 
fascinating combination of musical history and sociology. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the selections -- including the Frank Sinatra/Tommy Dorsey Orchestra 
version of "I'll Be Seeing You" and the Mills Brothers' "Till Then" -- are 
expressions of loneliness and love that could have been hits in peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
But other songs -- from the Andrews Sisters' "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" and 
Johnny Mercer's "G.I. Jive" to Vaughn Monroe's "When the Lights Go on Again 
(All Over the World)" and the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra's "(There'll Be Bluebirds 
Over) The White Cliffs of Dover" are clearly morale boosters aimed at 
comforting a wartime audience. 
</P>
<P>
The CD, compiled by singer Billy Vera and supervised by James Austin, includes 
an excellent 12-page booklet that puts the music in cultural perspective. Other 
selections include Mercer's "Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive," the Song Spinners' 
"Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer" and Martha Tilton's "I'll Walk Alone." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said that Vera -- whose No. 1 single "At This Moment" was released by 
Rhino -- suggested the concept and even the album title. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea wasn't to just do the biggest hits from those years, but to look for 
songs that had a special poignancy -- songs that actually did help get people 
through those difficult times," said Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already thinking of doing a Volume 2, but we don't want it to just be a 
repeat of this one. We're going to put some special twist on it -- possibly a 
group of R&amp;B songs about World War II or country songs about World War II." 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET SAMPLERS: Record companies have found that sending promotional CD 
samplers to industry tastemakers is such an effective way of showcasing new 
artists -- many of whom have difficulty getting mainstream radio airplay -- 
that labels are begining to make low-priced samplers available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Sire Records has already released some samplers and now CBS Records is 
releasing two of them -- one spotlighting country- and folk-related pop acts, 
the second centering on alternative rock artists. They can be found in most 
stores for between $6 and $8 each. 
</P>
<P>
The country-folk collection, titled "Hitchhiker," features tracks by 
Mary-Chapin Carpenter, Rosanne Cash, Shawn Colvin, Rodney Crowell, the Indigo 
Girls, James McMurtry, the O'Kanes and Darden Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Theodore," the second CBS sampler, features 16 songs, six of which have never 
been available on a CD album. The last include Kate Bush's "Be Kind to My 
Mistakes," Big Audio Dynamite's "If I Were a Carpenter" and Living Colour's 
"Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution." Among the other artists represented: Public Enemy 
("Welcome to the Terrordome"), the Psychedelic Furs ("House"), 3rd Bass, Poi 
Dog Pondering, the Rave-Ups, Nuclear Valdez and Prong.

'LIVING COLOR': BRASH, CRUEL BUT FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Saturday Night Jive, a butt-kicking half hour of the brashest, funniest, 
cruelest comedy on TV. 
</P>
<P>
That "In Living Color" would surface on Fox -- premiering at 9:30 p.m. Sunday 
on Channels 11 and 6 in advance of its regular run at 9 p.m. Saturdays -- is no 
shock. After all, Fox is where bold comedy has always been welcome, witness 
"The Simpsons," "The Tracey Ullman Show" and -- not always for the better -- 
"Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
"In Living Color" is a gamble not only time slot-wise -- airing on an evening 
when much of its youngish target audience can be expected to be out on the town 
-- but also attitude-wise. 
</P>
<P>
Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, this latest child of Fox is an earthquake of 
laughs that give satirical sketch comedy a distinctive flavor and, yes, color. 
Of the nine members of this talented comedy troupe, seven, including Wayans, 
are black. 
</P>
<P>
The show opens joltingly, with Mike Tyson (Wayans) and Robin Givens (Kim Coles) 
as they would appear with Chuck Woolery (Jim Carrey) on "The Love Connection." 
Even more than the material, it's the impressions -- especially Wayans as Tyson 
-- that put you away. 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight is "The Homeboy Shopping Network," a spoof of "The Home 
Shopping Network" with Wayans and his brother, Damon Wayans, as a couple of 
kids selling stolen goods -- including a NASA satellite dish -- out of the back 
of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Still unkinder, but very, very funny, is "Men on Film," with Damon Wayans and 
David Alan Grier vamping to the hilt as flaming gays discussing movies, 
including "Great Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
A running bit is "Great Moments in Black History," this week revealing the 
story of astronaut "Slick Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the greatest moments of "In Living Color" arrive in later episodes. One 
is a parody of those pretentious TV commercials for Calvin Klein's "Obsession" 
cologne. This time most of the actors are black, and the name of the cologne is 
"Oppression." 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to show up later is the hilarious "Wrath of Farrakhan," in which 
the Nation of Islam leader unseats Capt. Kirk and takes over the Enterprise 
with the cooperation of Spock and the the crew. Kirk to Spock: "Are you out of 
your Vulcan mind?" 
</P>
<P>
Nothing and no one is sacred here. No one, apparently, but Sammy Davis Jr. The 
very funny "Sammy Is Mandela" -- with Tommy Davidson as Davis singing "The 
Mandy Man" -- was dropped after getting an intense negative reaction from a 
test audience. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of "In Living Color" works, and some of the show looks like it was 
finished about 30 seconds before air time. Otherwise, this is just wonderful 
stuff. There's a sense of danger here. "Saturday Night Live" has had it from 
time to time. "In Living Color" has it big time. HOWARD ROSENBERG

Baseball must share the spotlight with hockey and boxing among this weekend's 
sports viewing choices on television. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are featured in CBS' first Major League Baseball telecast since 
1965, with the Houston Astros providing the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage begins at 10 a.m. today on Channels 2 and 8. The same two teams meet 
at 11:30 a.m. Sunday on Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, whose coverage in the early days of this season has established it as the 
successor to NBC as the baseball network, debuts its Sunday-night game schedule 
with the Montreal Expos hosting the New York Mets at 5 p.m. Zane Smith, who was 
1-13 last season but whose salary this season will be $660,000, is scheduled to 
pitch for Montreal against Dwight Gooden. 
</P>
<P>
In hockey, the Kings remain on the brink of ousting the defending Stanley Cup 
champion for the second consecutive season and again could break many hearts in 
the province of Alberta with a win over the Calgary Flames tonight. Prime 
Ticket's telecast of the Smythe Division semifinal sixth game begins at 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of boxing's middleweight championship will be decided today. Mike 
McCallum defends the World Boxing Assn. version against Michael Watson at 4:30 
p.m. on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" (Channels 7, 3, 42), while undefeated 
Michael Nunn of Agoura Hills risks his International Boxing Federation 
championship against Marlon Starling at 7 p.m. on Home Box Office. STEVEN

CARVEL COLLINS; WILLIAM FAULKNER EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carvel Collins, considered the world's foremost authority on the complex and 
controversial author William Faulkner, has died in an Oceanside hospital after 
a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who had lived in Vista in San Diego County since his 1978 retirement, 
died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
First intrigued by Faulkner in 1929 as a student at Miami University, Collins 
was the first professor in the world to offer a course solely devoted to 
Faulkner. He did that at Harvard in 1942 -- seven years before Faulkner won the 
Nobel Prize and with it worldwide critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Collins spent more than five decades researching Faulkner, but, to the 
disappointment of many scholars, never wrote a planned biography. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never tired of knowing Faulkner," he told a Los Angeles Times interviewer 
in 1986. "My joy in this search is inexhaustible. Never been dull. The more you 
know, the more you realize how divine he really was." 
</P>
<P>
He had personally promised Faulkner never to write his biography until after 
his death, which occurred in 1962, Collins said in that interview. His plans 
were further delayed, he said, when Faulkner's widow authorized another writer 
to do a two-volume biography published in 1974 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Collins did write scores of articles on Faulkner and introductions to books of 
Faulkner collections he edited, including "New Orleans Sketches" and "The 
Unvanquished." 
</P>
<P>
He had arranged for his prodigious research files, which filled his workroom 
behind the garage of the Vista house, to go to the University of Texas 
Humanities Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
Born June 14, 1912, in West Union, Ohio, Collins earned his bachelor's degree 
at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and his master's and doctorate at the 
University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He taught English at Colorado State College, Stephens College, Harvard 
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' first marriage, to Mary Brewster, ended in divorce. He is survived by 
his second wife, Ann Greene Collins; his daughter from his first marriage, Lucy 
Emerson Collins of New York City, and a brother, Charles, of Phoenix.

CREATIONISTS SUE FOR RIGHT TO GIVE MASTER'S DEGREE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: INSTITUTE IN SANTEE SAYS THE STATE HAS VIOLATED ITS CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS BY WITHDRAWING ITS PERMISSION TO ISSUE DEGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small, private Christian graduate school filed suit in federal court Friday 
alleging that the state Department of Education, Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig and other state administrators have violated its 
constitutional rights by withdrawing its license to issue master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In a 23-page complaint filed in U. S. District Court in San Diego, attorneys 
for the Institute for Creation Research in Santee alleged that Honig and his 
department have deprived the school of freedom of speech, free exercise of 
religion and due process. The suit seeks an injunction against the state for 
withdrawing its approval, unspecified damages and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not what view of origins is correct," the suit says, "but 
whether a private institution may be forced to indoctrinate its students in the 
state-approved interpretation and to censor an alternative interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
In March, after a state Board of Education evaluation team recommended that 
state approval be removed, Honig denied approval to the institute to grant 
master's of science degrees. Since then, administrators at the institute have 
accused Honig of being a "religious bigot." 
</P>
<P>
"If the state can tell a private Christian school that they can't teach 
Christian doctrine, then the state has too much power," said John Morris, 
administrative vice president of the institute. "We're not asking the state to 
rule that creationism is the valid scientific interpretation, and we're not 
asking for inclusion of creationism in the public schools. We are asking for 
freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Morris and others claim that Honig's aim is to shut down the institute, which 
adheres to a strict biblical interpretation of the creation of the Earth and 
life on it. The institute has granted about 20 master's degrees in biology, 
geology, physics and science education since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to Honig, disputed that claim. 
</P>
<P>
"ICR's continued existence is not at question. Nobody is trying to shut down 
ICR," said Rukeyser, who had not yet seen the lawsuit. "But we cannot legally 
describe ICR's current curriculum as qualifying for a master's of science 
degree. . . . If they wish to grant master's of creationism degrees, that would 
be fine with (Honig). If they want to describe it as a degree in a system of 
beliefs, that would be fine. 
</P>
<P>
"What is at question is essentially truth in advertising," Rukeyser said. He 
compared the institute's claims to a car salesman offering "to sell me a used 
Ford, but calling it a Chevy." He also said that, if the institute sought 
independent accreditation, as do most private colleges and universities, "then 
they wouldn't have to deal with what Bill Honig thinks." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said: "I've been trained in only evolutionary schools, and I have many 
close friends who are evolutionists. We're not saying evolution is not a valid 
viewpoint. We're saying there's a better viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not Bible-thumping fundamentalists," he said. "We are scientists who are 
also Christians. We don't teach the Bible; we don't teach theology; we teach 
science. But Honig has said that, because our school has this creationist 
flavor, our science is no good." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit points out that the Department of Education licensed the institute 
in 1981, 1984 and 1988, "when the graduate school was not as strong 
academically as it was in 1989 and is today." The approval was withdrawn, the 
suit claims, only after Honig's intervention turned the approval process into a 
"sham." 
</P>
<P>
The suit says the five-member team that visited the school in late 1989 was 
"carefully stacked" to guarantee a negative evaluation. The team included two 
science faculty members from UCLA, one from UC San Diego, one from California 
State University, Long Beach and one from Cedarville (Ohio) College. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also accuses Honig and the department of violating California law by 
changing regulations governing the procedure to be followed when a license 
renewal has been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Rukeyser disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"At every step of the way, what we've done has been with legal guidance, and we 
are quite convinced that all the laws involved have been followed," he said. 
Instead of suing, he added, "ICR would be much better served by using its 
resources and energy to bring its faculty and curriculum up to the standards 
where they could seek accreditation from a non-governmental association." 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Honig and his colleagues have balked at licensing the 
institute because they "wrongly contended that such approval implied state 
endorsement of the school's philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Because the school is not accredited, it needs a state license to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said endorsement is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There are approved by Mr. Honig's office homosexual brothels that teach 
homosexual technique. Do they endorse that?" Morris asked. "The brochure is 
full of nude men doing things to each other. So hopefully we're not talking 
about endorsement here." 
</P>
<P>
Rukeyser retorted: "Does he claim that any of those institutions are claiming 
to offer master's of science degrees? I don't think so."

STUDENTS GROW TOMATOES FROM SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County school officials weren't exactly panicked, but they expressed 
some caution Friday in the wake of a report that some tomato seeds distributed 
to U.S. schools after exposure to radiation in space could be toxic. 
</P>
<P>
The officials took the position that an attack of killer tomatoes in the county 
later this year appears unlikely but is worth thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
Tomato seeds that spent more than five years on an earth-orbiting satellite as 
part of a NASA experiment already are flourishing in Ventura County, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at Cabrillo Middle School in Ventura said students planted the tomato 
seeds from the NASA school program soon after they received them three weeks 
ago. The tiny plants have already sprouted and are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
Science teacher Donald Boger said the school's three science instructors have 
turned the experiment over to about 200 seventh-grade students to compare the 
development of the plants, whose seeds were flown into space aboard the shuttle 
Challenger, with the growth of plants from a control group that remained on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But Boger said school officials will wait until any tomatoes appear and are 
tested before deciding whether they are safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the fruit appears, I would say nobody would be able to tell," Boger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A memo written by a NASA contractor and obtained this week by The Times said 
there is "a remote possibility that radiation-caused mutations could cause the 
plants to produce toxic fruit." 
</P>
<P>
But NASA officials called a press conference Friday to dismiss any threat that 
"killer tomatoes" may have accidentally found their way into the country under 
its auspices, proclaiming the tomatoes to be as safe as any grown in the 
nation's back yards. 
</P>
<P>
About 12.5 million seeds were stored on the satellite as part of NASA's Space 
Exposed Experiment Developed for Students (SEEDS). The satellite was retrieved 
in January. Information about the experiment was sent to 180,000 teachers 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
At least half a dozen schools in Ventura County are participating in the SEEDS 
program, said Deanna Pinson, a spokeswoman for the Park Seed Co. in Greenwood, 
S.C., which supplied NASA with the seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura High School agricultural science teacher James Parton said that a 
package from NASA containing the seeds is on his desk at the school waiting to 
be planted when classes resume next week after spring break -- and that the 
students will go ahead and plant them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real skeptical that these seeds would have been exposed to anything that 
could carry over to their fruit once they grow," Parton said. "I'm more worried 
about the environment it's in now than what it may have been exposed to 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Parton said he would consider eating the tomatoes. "The possibility that it 
could cause any harm to any human is just ridiculous," he said. "If I grow 
them, I'll eat them." 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura High Principal Robert Cousar questioned whether the seeds are safe 
enough for school experiments. "Why distribute them to schoolchildren?" Cousar 
asked. "Why not give them to some experimental laboratories to see if something 
is wrong with them? It doesn't seem very intelligent, does it?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Piru School in Piru, Principal Lynn Edmonds said teachers have received 
the seeds and will plant them, but that officials have never really considered 
eating the tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wise not to eat the fruit," Edmonds said. "We saw it as a 
scientific investigation and didn't see it as a fruit-growing exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds said the seeds arrived in a "nice little packet" of well-organized 
information and Piru's students and teachers are eager to begin the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real strong science program and we also have a school farm, so it 
fit in very naturally," Edmonds said. "I don't think there's any problem from 
the experiment itself." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds said students at the year-round elementary school, who are on a 
three-week spring break, may wait until the beginning of the next school year 
in August to plant the seeds to monitor their growth over time. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrillo science teacher Richard Smith said the most immediate question at the 
school is how many of the plants will survive spring break. About 80% of the 
seeds germinated, and teachers expect to lose about 10% of those this week, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As for scientific observations thus far, Cabrillo students have noted nothing

COUNCILMAN, CITY IN 'FRIENDLY' SUIT OVER GARAGE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, after discovering that he had unwittingly built a customized 
carport on city property, Ventura Councilman John McWherter faced a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, elected officials cannot enter into contracts with the cities 
they represent, so McWherter cannot buy the land under his carport or accept it 
as a gift from the city. 
</P>
<P>
This left McWherter with the prospect of tearing down his garage or resigning 
from office -- all for a clump of land that is of no use to the city and that 
was recently appraised at a mere $500. 
</P>
<P>
Neither idea appealed to him, so the councilman came up with an original 
solution -- he asked the city to sue him, in hopes that a judge would decide 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them to sue me; it's the only way we could do it," McWherter said. 
"Then I had to countersue to give my side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the countersuit was the other attorney's idea," he said, referring 
to the special counsel appointed by the city attorney to handle the case on 
behalf of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's trying to do is to get an equitable resolution not by contract but 
through a court order, which would have the same effect as a contract," said 
Alan Ashby, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office. He would not 
comment on the appropriateness of such actions. "The problem arises rarely 
enough that there is no normal way to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Since neither McWherter nor the city could be properly represented through the 
city attorney's office, both sides hired private firms to represent them. For 
the past year, the dispute has been quietly and slowly working its way through 
the legal process. By the time it is over, it will have cost each side about 
$9,000, the councilman estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council is our boss," said Assistant City Atty. Mike Dougherty, 
explaining why he hired outside counsel. "It isn't appropriate that we go 
against them." 
</P>
<P>
The issue will be decided by a Superior Court judge in a non-jury trial 
scheduled to begin July 30. If he loses, McWherter said, he will tear down his 
$1,000 garage and park his 21-foot-long recreational vehicle on the driveway. 
Resigning his council seat is out of the question, McWherter said. "I've been 
there for 17 years and loved every minute of it. I've got two more years left 
and I plan to run again." 
</P>
<P>
McWherter's problem was discovered in October, 1987, when a city crew surveying 
the adjacent property discovered that Mint Lane, which leads directly into 
McWherter's garage, was about 12 yards north of where it should have been, 
according to city maps. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter, who bought his three-bedroom house in 1966, thought the surveyors 
had made a mistake and asked for a remeasurement, which eventually showed that 
Mint Lane had been laid down improperly when the land was subdivided in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last September, accuses McWherter of trespassing on city 
property and seeks a restraining order to keep McWherter out of his garage. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendants' interference, occupancy, possession and use of the disputed 
property will continue, causing great and irreparable injury to the plaintiff," 
the suit alleges. It also demands payments from McWherter "for damages in an 
amount to be determined." 
</P>
<P>
Standing at the entrance of his hillside chalet one recent day, enjoying his 
spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean, McWherter seemed hardly affected by the 
allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how lawsuits work!" he cried, throwing up his hands, bursting into 
laughter. "You can't go to court as a sham and tell the court 'we're buddies.' 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the suit didn't say how much the damages are worth, did they? That's 
because the damages are zero!" 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty seems to agree. "We're trying to work it out so the public is 
protected and Mr. McWherter is protected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter's countersuit asks the city to deed the land to his name or place it 
in a trust until he retires from the council and seeks payment of his 
attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the councilman is anything but troubled by the thought of 
suing the city he serves. "This is a friendly lawsuit," he said. "The lawsuits 
say a lot of things, but what really matters are the memos the attorneys 
exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legal proceedings continue at a less than hectic pace. A 
court-mandated settlement hearing scheduled for April 19 was postponed 
indefinitely. That is because the attorney for the city could not fit it in his 
schedule, McWherter said. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorneys don't work long hours on this case," he said. "That's why it's 
taking so long." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is no point to the settlement hearing because both McWherter 
and Dougherty confirmed that no settlement will be reached because it is 
illegal for the parties to enter an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody understands why we have to go through this," McWherter said. "The only 
reason I'm in this predicament is because the city built the road in the wrong 
place."

OFFICERS' FIRINGS UPHELD BY CIVIL SERVICE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego police officers who lost their jobs, one for alleged sexual 
misconduct, the other for falsely reporting his involvement in an off-duty 
shooting, have lost their appeals to be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released Friday, the city Civil Service Commission ruled that the 
conduct of Officer Charles R. Demers was "offensive," "deplorable and seriously 
jeopardized the reputation and public trust of the entire" Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Two young women testified in commission hearings that they were frightened when 
Demers pulled them to the side of the road in separate incidents, then began 
making sexual advances toward them in the summer of 1988 -- a time of 
heightened public awareness because of the Craig Peyer case. Peyer, a 
California Highway Patrol officer, was convicted of murdering a young woman he 
had pulled over on Interstate 15 late at night. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the commission noted that Demers provided "untruthful testimony" 
under oath and that his firing should not be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also found that Officer David A. Nellis lied to his superiors 
and to the commission in fabricating the details of a shooting that he said 
occurred in the 2100 block of Saipan Drive on April 26, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites Nellis for waiting "approximately 42 hours prior to reporting 
the shooting" to the Police Department. It notes that none of 13 area residents 
who were contacted about the shooting heard the shots "alleged to be fired" by 
the officer. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk who worked at the convenience store where Nellis said the shooting took 
place testified that he did not hear any shots or observe any "shooting victims 
or any related activity," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The commission supported Nellis' termination notice of February, 1989, which 
says: "You falsely reported that you were involved in an off-duty shooting. 
Further, you failed to obey lawful orders of superior officers during the 
investigation, and failed to answer questions truthfully." 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Civil Service Commission also noted that Nellis refused to 
cooperate fully with internal-affairs officers investigating his case. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt, the attorney for both officers, said Friday that he will take 
the Demers case to court in an attempt to win back his client's job. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely intend to pursue Demers through the courts," he said, contending 
that the officer was fired and then reinstated on various levels of the command 
staff, and that Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper eventually intervened and 
upheld the termination. 
</P>
<P>
"That was unprecedented," Bobbitt said. "And I've got new information that one 
of the alleged victims was a friend of (Dist. Atty.) Ed Miller. So I want to 
find out what involvement Ed Miller may have had." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said he has not studied the commission's report on Nellis and will 
"wait and see" whether to pursue that appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Pent, chief of the special-operations division for the district 
attorney, said on Miller's behalf that "the district attorney has intervened in 
no way in the Charles Demers matter and has no knowledge of either of the two 
victims that were mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
The commission cited each officer's otherwise impeccable police record in 
making its findings, but said the civil service violations in each case fail to 
warrant a repeal of the department's dismissals. 
</P>
<P>
In Demers' case, the report says, "despite such record . . . the commission 
finds that the appellant's egregious, unacceptable misconduct in this case, 
aggravated by his providing untruthful testimony under oath and his admission 
of issuing previous invitations to female citizens for personal conversations 
while conducting official business, critically detracted from his suitability 
and acceptance as a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
Demers was fired in March, 1989, after two years as a police officer in San 
Diego and after seven years as an officer in Rhode Island. The district 
attorney declined to file criminal charges against Demers, 32. John 
Vanderslice, a deputy city attorney who asked the commission to uphold the 
termination, said prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence for a 
guilty verdict of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year-old aerobics instructor testified that she and a friend were driving 
home from a nightclub in July, 1988, when Demers pulled them over. After giving 
her a sobriety test, she said, he threatened to take her to the County Jail at 
Las Colinas. 
</P>
<P>
She testified that, later, while she sat in the back of the patrol car, he 
squatted 2 feet in front of her and asked her to show him her genitals. 
</P>
<P>
The woman "responded by saying something to the effect of, 'Give me a break,' " 
the report says. "The appellant (Demers) then backed up and said something to 
the effect of, 'OK, you can go; go on, get out.' " 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a 19-year-old San Diego State University student testified 
that she was headed home after a late-night party when Demers pulled her over. 
She said he gave her a sobriety test, threatened her with jail and then said he 
would release her. 
</P>
<P>
But she testified that Demers told her, "Since you've been partying with your 
friends all night, would you mind partying with me for a while?" 
</P>
<P>
She said he motioned her to a patch of nearby shrubbery and when she cried, he 
asked her, "Are you embarrassed because you've never been with a man before?" 
</P>
<P>
She said she began crying "really hard" and covered her face with her hands. 
She testified that Demers then told her that, if she stayed with him, "it would 
be the best five minutes she ever had."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OBSTETRICIAN LOSES LICENSE OVER 4 INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State health officials have revoked the medical license of a longtime Long 
Beach obstetrician who they say injured four infants by prematurely 
administering anesthesia to mothers in labor, then using forceps improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Archibald F. Forster, 67, was ordered by the state Board of Medical Quality 
Assurance to surrender the medical license he was issued in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined his actions were "so far below the accepted standard 
of care" that they constituted "gross negligence and incompetence," according 
to the decision made public this week. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation centered on four babies delivered by Forster at Pacific 
Hospital of Long Beach between October, 1984, and July, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Forster said he retired four years ago after Long Beach hospitals refused to 
allow him on staff, and that he has not delivered a baby since. He said his 
license expired last October.

EX-SECURITY GUARD ADMITS KILLING HOMELESS WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man who was a security guard at the downtown San Diego courthouse 
pleaded guilty Friday to murdering a homeless mother who came to the courthouse 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kulo, 31, admitted to second-degree murder in the Jan. 7 slaying of Mary 
Jo Zavala, 34, who authorities believe was killed in Kulo's trailer in the area 
of Orange and Cypress avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Kulo also pleaded guilty to molesting the dead woman's two daughters, ages 10 
and 4, who are believed to have witnessed their mother's murder along with 
their 2-year-old brother. Zavala was strangled and struck with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Kulo faces a maximum sentence of 31 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Bill Woodward dismissed a third molestation count and 
a charge of kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Kulo's attorney said that, if Kulo had gone to trial and been convicted of 
first-degree murder plus the two dismissed counts, his sentence would have been 
substantially greater. 
</P>
<P>
"He was looking (at a possible sentence) in excess of 40 years. . . . That's 
what the potential was," attorney Bill Youmans said. 
</P>
<P>
Kulo answered yes to questions posed by the judge about the case and admitted 
to molesting the girls, but he did not elaborate on any of his answers. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for June 1. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be eligible for parole in his early 50s," Youmans said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said he was satisfied with the plea. 
</P>
<P>
The main witnesses to the murder were the girls, he said, who told police that 
Kulo offered to let them stay in his trailer. They were awakened in the night, 
they said, and the 10-year-old said she saw her mother on the floor with blood 
on her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Zavala reportedly tried to get up, but Kulo put a rope around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
Elias said one girl was molested after the mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Kulo reportedly dropped the three children off at an information booth in 
Mission Bay Park. The 10-year-old told workers there about their ordeal and 
their mother's slaying, and her information led police to the discovery of 
Zavala's body Jan. 10 in the 2400 block of Murphy Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Kulo remains in County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 45-DAY MORATORIUM ON CONSTRUCTION SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned by oversized homes and recent resident complaints about the 
proliferation of condominiums, the Alhambra City Council has enacted a 45-day 
moratorium on construction. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency moratorium will give city officials "breathing room" while they 
review development standards for areas zoned for medium to high density, Mayor 
Barbara Messina said. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium exempts property owners who have already submitted plans to the 
city's Department of Community Development. About 120 applicants fall into that 
category, City Manager Kevin Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the city imposed a moratorium for about six months while it rezoned 
and reduced densities in 23 neighborhoods. The council, which may extend the 
latest moratorium, scheduled a May 14 public hearing on the matter.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: AIRPORT RENTAL FEE PROPOSAL REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Lawrence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vocal opposition from pilots at Camarillo and Oxnard airports has led to the 
rejection of a proposal that would have charged renters for sharing space with 
other aircraft owners. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, part of a revised rent and fee schedule to be presented to the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors, was recommended by the Department of 
Airports. 
</P>
<P>
The $25 monthly user fee would have helped offset the costs of services such as 
fire and rescue, security, and unrestricted use of taxiways and runways, said 
Austin Cline, the airports' administrative officer. Airports Administrator Jim 
O'Neill said that non-renters are "getting a free ride" by being able to store 
aircraft in hangars rented by others. 
</P>
<P>
But about 20 pilots and renters from the two cities were at the airport 
authorities' monthly meeting Thursday to challenge the proposal, saying those 
who occupy space in already rented hangars pay their way by buying airport 
fuel, parts and labor. 
</P>
<P>
Cline said he believes about 90 planes are being stored rent-free at the 
county-run airports, and that revenue from the $25 fee would have amounted to 
between $21,000 and $28,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Airport Authority member Mike Morgan said the revenue "wouldn't be 
worth the trouble." O'Neill added that not having the extra money "wouldn't 
break us." 
</P>
<P>
Pilots also opposed a recommended flowage fee increase from 4 to 5 cents a 
gallon on fuels sold by vendors on airport property. That was also rejected. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the proposed 1990-91 airport budgets were approved, and a 
study of the economic impact of the airports on surrounding communities was 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
The revised rent and fee schedule will go into effect July 1. Scott Lawrence

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUNIPERO SERRA HIGH TO ADMIT GIRLS IN FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major break from tradition, Junipero Serra High School in Gardena is 
planning to add pink tiles to one of its locker rooms, romance novels to its 
library and, most important, girls to its all-male student body. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Roman Catholic school will go coeducational in the fall of 
1991, administrators announced. 
</P>
<P>
Principal James Crowell, a 1970 Serra graduate, began pursuing coeducation 
about two years ago when enrollment began declining significantly as it lost 
potential students to coeducational parochial schools in Torrance and Playa del 
Rey. From 1986 to this school year, Serra's enrollment dropped from 520 to an 
all-time low of 266. 
</P>
<P>
"An all-boy school is really a holdover from the past," said Crowell, who spent 
14 years at Serra as a teacher and dean before becoming principal last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys are in favor of it," said student body President Kenny Davis.

ELECTIONS PALMDALE COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
FINAL TALLY CONFIRMS VICTORIES OF 2 CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The margin of victory narrowed Friday, but the result remained the same in the 
Palmdale City Council election, as a final vote count confirmed victories by 
two challengers who favor controlled growth over two pro-development 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
In semiofficial returns from Tuesday's election, challenger James Root held a 
slim 26-vote lead over first-term incumbent Tom Smith, with 137 of the 4,153 
ballots uncounted. When those ballots were tallied Friday, Root's lead slipped 
to 15 votes, but that was more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough three days and a sleepless three nights," said Root, 37, a 
high school teacher and homeowners group leader. "I feel a lot of relief right 
now. It's been tense, and the tension had built up hour by hour, and day by 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was unavailable for comment Friday but had said earlier that he would not 
ask for a recount if Root had at least a 10-vote lead. 
</P>
<P>
Root's victory means the Palmdale City Council, which had five pro-development 
lawmakers, now will be split 3-to-2. Root ran a joint campaign, calling for 
more controls on growth, with city Planning Commissioner James Ledford, the top 
vote-getter in the 10-candidate race. 
</P>
<P>
The final tally had been closely watched by supporters and foes of development 
in Palmdale. Although they will be a minority on the council, Ledford and Root 
together are expected to have some say in controlling development. 
</P>
<P>
In the final tally, Ledford got 1,621 votes (20.7%), and Root got 1,500 votes 
(19.2%), each winning four-year terms. Smith trailed with 1,485 votes (19%), 
followed by Daniel Becker, the other losing incumbent, with 1,204 votes 
(15.4%). None of the other candidates got more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The new tally made no change in the outcome of the other two contests on the 
Palmdale ballot. Mayor William (Pete) Knight got 60.8% of the vote to beat two 
opponents and win a new two-year term. And a ballot measure to give the mayor a 
four-year term starting in 1992 was defeated, 64.6% to 35.4%.

SUSPECT HELD AFTER ROCKS SMASH 5 CARS ON GOLDEN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

An Arleta man was arrested Friday for throwing softball- to watermelon-sized 
rocks from an overpass above the Golden State Freeway, hitting at least five 
cars and slightly injuring a teen-age boy, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was held for CHP officers by an enraged motorist whose truck was 
struck by a rock as it passed beneath Branford Street in Arleta. The motorist 
said he ran across the freeway and up the incline to the overpass, and then 
chased the suspect for a mile and a half. 
</P>
<P>
David Colon, 29, was arrested on suspicion of throwing debris at cars on a 
freeway, a felony, Officer Dennis Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing rocks about the size of softballs off of the overcrossing and 
at least five vehicles were damaged" in the southbound lanes, Yates said. "Some 
had dents and some had broken windows." One of the rocks that crashed through a 
windshield was the size of a small watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no known motive at this time," Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said a teen-age boy, whose name was unavailable, suffered a slight cut 
from broken glass but did not need medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The damaged cars pulled to the side of the freeway and traffic was not slowed, 
Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said at least two other men were throwing rocks from the overpass but got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Nichols, 50, of Mission Hills said he was a passenger in a pickup struck 
on the hood by a rock. Nichols said when the driver pulled over, he saw a man 
on the overpass "standing there with a big rock in his hand," and set out after 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if we tried to call the cops, by the time the cops got there, the 
guy is going to be gone," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing the freeway and dashing up an incline, he chased the fleeing man about 
a mile and a half, Nichols said, catching him with the help of CalTrans workers 
who saw the chase. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said Colon was being held at the Van Nuys Jail.

OIL SLICK 30 MILES OFF OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A slow-moving oil slick was seen Friday morning about 30 miles from the 
Oceanside shore, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The slick was noticed by a U. S. Coast Guard helicopter about 10:30 a.m. 
between San Clemente Island and Oceanside and was moving north, Coast Guard 
Petty Officer Charles Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared to be about 25 miles long and 25 yards wide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were not sure of the source of the slick and were monitoring it, but 
as of late Friday the oil was not moving ashore. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping an eye on it," Cowan said. "It is so far from shore there is not 
much we can do right now." 
</P>
<P>
If the slick remains at its current distance from shore, Cowan said, wind and 
wave action will break it up.

STREET SIGNS FADING FROM GREEN TO BLUE

<P>
The city of Ventura is slowly but surely replacing green street signs at major 
intersections with blue ones designed for easier reading. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been going on for the past two years and, according to 
Maintenance Services Supervisor John Betonte, night drivers should note a 
visible difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The new high-intensity signs are brighter and easier to read than the older 
engineering-grade signs we used to use," Betonte said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being easier to read, Betonte said, the new signs will be 
directly bolted to traffic-light structures. This will prevent the new signs 
from swaying in high winds. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Wells Road, the city is responsible for all signs beyond 
the curbside of freeway ramps. 
</P>
<P>
The silk-screened wood street signs in downtown Ventura will not be replaced 
with the new blue signs. Smaller street markers, those on poles and not 
attached to traffic lights, will also remain unchanged. RUSS CHARVONIA

SUIT CHALLENGES WATER-SAVING LAW; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: A GROUP CALLS THE CITY'S ORDINANCE THAT RATIONS WATER AND PLACES A 
MORATORIUM ON NEW HOOKUPS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit seeking to invalidate Ventura's water conservation ordinance, which 
calls for a moratorium on new construction and cutbacks for local business and 
residences, was filed late Friday against the city, Ventura City Atty. Peter 
Bulens said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was filed by a group called the Ventura Assn. for Fair Water Allocations, 
or something like that," Bulens said. No individual plaintiffs were named in 
the lawsuit, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Nielsen, the attorney representing the group, could not be reached for 
comment Friday at his home or office. 
</P>
<P>
Bulens said the lawsuit "basically alleges that the water ordinance is not fair 
because it violates equal protection rights guaranteed in the Constitution and 
that it should also be nullified because we didn't go through an environmental 
review process before adopting it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the suit is the first of its type filed against a municipal 
entity since the four-year statewide drought began. 
</P>
<P>
Bulens said he is confident that the water ordinance will withstand the legal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ordinance is quite defensible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Council members were reached by phone or in person by Bulens and 
informed about the suit near the end of the workday, he said. Councilmen Todd 
Collart, John McWherter and Gary Tuttle said they had not seen the suit and 
therefore could not comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Monahan, who cast the only council vote against the ordinance 
when it was adopted in March, said: "I knew this would happen. It was just a 
matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, single-family homes are receiving allocations of 294 
gallons a day and multifamily residences are limited to 196 gallons a day 
unless they can obtain exemptions from the city for undue hardships. Businesses 
and institutions, such as the city government, have to reduce their water 
consumption by 15% to 20%. Violators are penalized by up to 10 times the normal 
fee for excess use. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was adopted despite strong opposition from developers and members 
of the business community, who complained that the measure was too drastic and 
called it a ploy to control growth in the city.

WEST VALLEY PET OWNERS GET DISCOUNT ON SPAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who adopt stray dogs and cats from the city's West Valley animal shelter 
may have them sterilized at subsidized rates at nearby private veterinary 
clinics, under a program announced Friday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The new program is aimed at increasing the percentage of adopted pets that are 
spayed or neutered by making it more convenient for owners. The city operates a 
single veterinary clinic in the Valley, in North Hollywood, that performs the 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that some people who adopted pets at the West Valley Animal Care 
and Control Center were not having the animals spayed or neutered because they 
had to either drive to the North Hollywood shelter or pay the higher charges 
set by private vets. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, when adopting a pet, the new owners must pay a sterilization 
deposit -- $20 for a female and $14 for a male -- refunded when they provide 
proof that the animal has been spayed or neutered elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, the shelter also will issue the new pet owners surgery 
vouchers that can be redeemed for sterilizations at 22 participating private 
West San Fernando Valley clinics. The city will reimburse the private vets $48 
for spaying a female and $40 for neutering a male. Pet owners will pay only 
their sterilization deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the reimbursements will come from the city's Animal Sterilization 
Trust Fund, an accumulation of unclaimed sterilization deposits and other 
donations, Bradley said. The trust fund totals about $225,000, said Dyer 
Huston, a spokesman for the city Department of Animal Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Huston said the additional hassle for pet owners in the West Valley may have 
contributed to the abundance of unsterilized pets. Huston said department 
records show that more than half of the sterilization fees charged by the 
city's animal shelters are never refunded, indicating that those pets probably 
are not sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, cities must encourage pet owners to sterilize their animals.

AROUND THE VALLEY / SEBASTIAN ROTELLA : GROUP TARGETS CASTRO'S DOMINO

<P>
Cuban Spanish ricochets in the private dining room, fast and hard and soft at 
the same time: 
</P>
<P>
"He is a modern Nero," Javier Quintero says. 
</P>
<P>
"He realizes that he is surrounded," says Maria Quintero, his wife. "If we 
dance to his tune, that's no good," growls Reynaldo Rodriguez, a white-haired 
warrior with chiseled features. "He expects us to want war. They say we want an 
invasion, we want to fight. . . . No, that's not the way. What we must tell him 
is this: We want elections, we want a plebiscite, we want to be allowed in, 
organize, express ourselves, create parties of opposition. Democracy! He 
already has the invasion within." 
</P>
<P>
The monthly meeting of the National Assn. of Cuban Lawyers in Exile, California 
chapter, is a gathering of voluble veterans of a Thirty Years War. The war has 
gained urgency over the past year as the walls of Eastern Europe dissolve with 
the speed of images flickering across the 6 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
Energized, the Cuban lawyers discuss ways of bringing about what they see as 
the inevitable fall of the next domino: Fidel Castro's Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the scene multiplied in Cuban-American communities nationwide, 
conversations laced with coffee and smoke and hope. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about the aging dictator -- shaggy, wide-eyed, blustering, defying 
all comers during televised harangues. But he is running out of friends. There 
have been rumblings, rumors, cries of "Down with Fidel" in public places. He 
looks more than ever like an endangered species, a dinosaur-tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 men and women in the restaurant are in their 50s and 60s, well-dressed, 
their dignity forged from the ashes of a frozen tropical past. Most of them 
live comfortably rebuilt lives in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But all of them remain citizens of El Exilio, The Exile, that Cuban-American 
space preserved by nostalgia and passion. 
</P>
<P>
Vindication has been a long time coming, according to Mario Tapanes, who wears 
square glasses and gestures pugilistically as he talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years telling the truth and no one listened," he says. "I have no 
confidence in the American media. The media romanticized Castro." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez agrees. "They made him into Jesus Christ, the Robin Hood of America. 
. . . Finally he has lost stature internationally. . . . For the first time in 
the 31 years that he has been in power, I see him truly worried." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez is the president of an international federation of former Cuban 
political prisoners. He spent six years as a political prisoner, two years in a 
squalid compound on the Isle of Pines that he said was rigged with dynamite to 
prevent escape or invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Aguirre, association president, calls the meeting to order. Among the 
items of past business is a telegram of congratulations sent to Nicaragua's new 
president, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez announces that his prisoners' federation will honor six 
Cuban-American officers in the U.S. military for writing an open letter urging 
the Cuban army to refrain from violence against their people if there is an 
insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion touches on TV Marti, the latest U.S. government offensive 
against Castro, a television version of Radio Free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts by the Cuban government to block the signal, the word from 
Miami is that the programs are reaching viewers in Cuba, Tapanes says. He takes 
vigorous exception to complaints that the programming includes too many "light" 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are saying here in the press is that it costs $30 million for 
nothing, for silly programs. That is not true. When the people there see what 
life is like here, how a man who works in a factory lives -- he has his own 
car, his computer, the VCR, he goes to McDonald's, he comes and he goes -- that 
will have even more impact than the news. These programs carry a message, a 
powerful message." 
</P>
<P>
Then Tapanes says he would like to introduce a concept he has encountered in 
dealings with corporate America. He savors the syllables: 
"Brain-storming-session." 
</P>
<P>
The first time Tapanes took part in a brainstorming session -- people 
free-associating and thinking out loud, every opinion given equal value -- he 
was amused. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'That's what we Cubans do whenever we get together.' " 
</P>
<P>
Suggestion adopted. A note pad fills with ideas for shaping post-Castro Cuba: 
Agrarian reform. Urban reform. Labor reform. 
</P>
<P>
Silver-haired Felix de Quesada adds a suggestion: "Political tolerance in 
Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
"Now there's a good specific suggestion," Tapanes says. "What will happen to 
the Fidelista or Communist Party in Cuba. Will it be legal?" 
</P>
<P>
"First we shoot them and then we legalize them," Quesada says, deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread laughter, aimed as much at their own ideological intensity as at the 
joke's exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Aguirre and Ernesto Torres are asked how many people in the room 
would go back if the dream of Fidel's fall materializes. The men smile wryly, 
they nod, they talk of children and grandchildren and Americanization. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably more would stay than move back," Aguirre says. 
</P>
<P>
"But think about this," Torres says. "I might be a guy who goes on vacation to 
Las Vegas, to Baja California. Why do that if I can go back to my own country, 
get a little place of my own? . . . Miami is 50 minutes from Cuba. The cultural 
movement and interchange would be incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Gatherings such as this serve a cathartic purpose, says Benito Borges. There is 
an expression for it, he says, his tough open face growing reflective: Sudar el 
odio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweat out the hate," he says. "We have to sweat out the hate, as if it were a 
fever. So we can go back without hate."

POLICE DOG STOPS SUSPECT IN CAR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old El Cajon transient was arrested Friday in Lakeside after leading 
police on a chase that ended shortly after he rammed a Sheriff's Department 
canine unit car, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase started Friday evening in El Cajon when police saw Christopher 
Rossmiller in a car that had been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Officers radioed for assistance from the Sheriff's Department, said Sgt. Roy 
Stamper of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police pursued Rossmiller through Lakeside, traveling north on Highway 67 until 
they reached a dirt lot by East Pino Road. The car driven by Rossmiller 
stalled. When he restarted it, he rammed the car carrying the police dog Sarge 
and continued out toward Lake Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
The damaged Sheriff's Department car remained in the chase. When Rossmiller 
reached Flynn Springs Road off Interstate 8, he jumped from his car and began 
running through a mobile-home park. The German shepherd leaped after Rossmiller 
and stopped him by fastening onto his groin, Stamper said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAR RUNS STOP SIGN; DRIVER KILLED, 6 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and six other people, including four children, were injured 
when a car went through a stop sign and hit another auto broadside in an 
intersection near Palmdale, the California Highway Patrol reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said Louis Ross, 58, of Littlerock died about 8:20 p.m. Thursday after 
the car he was driving north on 110th Street went through a stop sign at 
Palmdale Boulevard and crashed into a westbound car carrying five people. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in Ross' car, Michael Jackson, 35, of Littlerock suffered major 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the other car, Steven Schroeder, 33, of Murrieta also had major 
injuries. His wife, Laura Schroeder, 31, and Kimberly Schroeder, 1, Jamie 
Henderson, 10, and Kevin Henderson, 9, had injuries ranging from minor to 
moderate. All were being treated at hospitals in the Antelope Valley, Officer 
Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said it was unclear why Ross did not stop at the intersection.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PALMDALE HIGH WINS IMPROVEMENT AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palmdale High School was honored Friday as one of California's most improved 
high schools in the results of an annual awards program announced by state 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig. 
</P>
<P>
Of more than 800 public high schools in the state, Palmdale was one of only two 
in Los Angeles County to receive the improvement award. 
</P>
<P>
The other was Avalon High School in Long Beach. Only 17 high schools statewide 
received the designation. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement awards honor schools, generally low achievers in the past, that 
have made substantial progress in bettering their performance in areas such as 
student test scores, numbers of students enrolled in advanced classes and 
dropout and attendance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale still has a high dropout rate compared to other California high 
schools, said Carol Kennedy, a state Department of Education analyst. But she 
said the school made progress in getting more students enrolled in advanced 
level classes and in improving scores.

COUPLE CARING FOR 5 SMALL CHILDREN WITH AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
FOSTER PARENTS: A WOODLAND HILLS COUPLE MAKE A HOME FOR AILING YOUNGSTERS AND 
SHARE THEIR LOVE WITH SIX OTHER ADOPTED CHILDREN. 
</P>

<P>
The bureaucratic designation for the five small children Christine and 
Roosevelt Coleman have taken into their home is "medically fragile." 
</P>
<P>
That means the children, all under 3 years old, probably won't live more than 
another five years because they all have AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best luck the children have had in their short lives is that there 
are foster parents such as the Colemans. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills couple care for more children with AIDS then any other 
foster parents in Los Angeles County, according to officials of the county 
Department of Children's Services. And they have six other adopted children 
from troubled backgrounds, for a total of 11. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Coleman carries gloves, a mask and goggles in a diaper bag on her 
frequent trips to the hospital, in case she must be present during procedures 
that might splash her with blood. She uses medical terms with an ease gained 
from intensive independent study of the disease as she recounts how she watched 
five-month-old twins die in January. 
</P>
<P>
"The wasting stage of the illness attacks the body systemically," she said 
Thursday. Her husband and their six healthy adopted children joined her during 
an interview in a cramped radio station studio in Sepulveda, part of a campaign 
to encourage foster care and adoption of AIDS-afflicted babies. 
</P>
<P>
"No part of the body is spared . . . They died five days apart to the minute." 
</P>
<P>
But, Coleman said: "The most difficult time in dealing with it is when they are 
healthy. In their own little minds they might have plans for the future. When 
they talk about 'When I grow up,' that's when it's the saddest. That's when I 
have to get up and go out of the room." 
</P>
<P>
When the Colemans first decided to adopt children after learning Christine 
could not give birth, they chose to take in those from troubled backgrounds, 
including children of drug addicts. Growing news about AIDS-infected babies 
born to intravenous drug users caused them to consider the possibility that one 
of the children they had adopted might be at risk. In looking for information, 
they learned of the pressing need for adults who would care for AIDS-infected 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
County child welfare officials estimate that they encounter 20 such babies a 
month. The incidence of AIDS among pregnant women in Los Angeles County is 
estimated at 1 in 1,000 by groups and officials trying to deal with the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Christine, who grew up in a family torn by drug addiction, studied the risk of 
transmission and decided that caring for AIDS-infected babies was something 
that she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt Coleman, who runs a toxic chemical disposal company from the family 
home, said it took some persuading. 
</P>
<P>
"The main concern was about the possibility of them biting and stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the family and two live-in housekeepers have undergone training that has 
prepared them to handle the babies and increased their sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned about infection, 13-year-old Teddy said, "It doesn't 
concern me. When there's blood, the kids don't touch it because they've been 
trained not to touch it." 
</P>
<P>
Only one neighbor family grew suddenly reticent about letting their children 
play with the Coleman children, she said. Otherwise, she said, the family has 
encountered no local hostility, such as that confronted by Ryan White, who died 
Sunday of AIDS at age 18 after becoming nationally known for fighting prejudice 
in his Indiana school. Instead, they have gotten much support and encouragement 
at school and activities such as Little League baseball, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is more awareness," Christine Coleman said. "You might get 
problems in more backward areas or parts of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman is active in encouraging and training foster parents interested in 
caring for babies with AIDS. She promotes the cause at events such as an 
upcoming benefit for a group called Caring For Babies with AIDS, which wants to 
establish a group home for afflicted babies in Los Angeles.

NEW VISA POLICY TO LIFT AIDS CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bowing to unrelenting international pressure, the Bush Administration on Friday 
unveiled a special 10-day visa that does not require foreigners to declare 
whether they are infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is clearly intended to avoid a widespread boycott of June's 
international AIDS conference in San Francisco by AIDS activists and 
researchers upset with previous immigration restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But while conference organizers were optimistic that the announcement will 
bolster international participation at the meeting, the policy still left some 
unsatisfied, and attendance for the meeting remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, a foreigner infected with the AIDS virus had to disclose that fact 
and then seek a waiver -- a procedure that many found offensive. 
</P>
<P>
The new "short-term" visa will be available to visitors scheduled to attend any 
professional, scientific or academic conference that has been deemed "in the 
public interest" by Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement, by the Justice Department and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said Sullivan has "certified" two such conferences: the 
four-day, sixth annual International Conference on AIDS and the five-day 19th 
International Congress of the World Federation of Hemophilia, to be held in 
Washington in August. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen whether this new policy will relieve the concerns of the 
countries and health organizations threatening to boycott all international 
health conferences in the United States," said Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) and 
a member of the National Commission on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents progress, and all progress is welcomed. But, obviously, it is 
not a resolution for the problems raised," added Dr. June Osborne, chairwoman 
of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the controversy over whether AIDS infection belongs at all 
on a list of contagious diseases -- including leprosy, syphilis and 
tuberculosis -- for which foreigners can be barred from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was added to that list -- 
which is normally compiled by the U.S. Public Health Service -- by Congress in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Following prolonged and vocal protests from groups that included the 
International Societies of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization, the 
federal Centers for Disease Control last February recommended that all but 
active tuberculosis be expunged from that list. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly HIV does not belong on that list," said Osborne, dean of the 
University of Michigan School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush Administration officials have said that it would take another act of 
Congress to remove HIV infection from the list. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rowland introduced legislation that would grant Sullivan the 
authority to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland on Friday called the new visa policy "a positive step forward," but he 
said that "more needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) agreed, adding: "The Administration needs to 
continue to work with Congress in order to realign U.S. immigration policy with 
sound public health principles." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who remained unappeased by the new visa was Dr. Mervyn Silverman of 
the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terribly disappointed because, on a scale of 10, this is probably a minus 
2," he said. "It misses the point. The issue isn't the 1990 conference. The 
conference only focused attention on what is very poor policy." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Van Gorder, a spokesman for the San Francisco conference, said: "I would 
think this change will secure the continuing sponsorship of WHO and the 
International AIDS society." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I don't think this will impress in the least some of the other 
boycotting organizations." Among them are the French and Swiss health 
ministries. 
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 6,000 scientists, public health officials and AIDS workers 
from around the world have registered for the meeting, with organizers hoping 
for as many as 12,000 attendees. Last year, 11,200 persons attended the fifth 
annual meeting in Montreal.

BUSH, THATCHER MEET, CALL FOR SOVIET RESTRAINT

<P>
President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meeting here 
Friday, expressed frustration over the latest Soviet ultimatum on Lithuania but 
conceded there may be little the West can do to prevent a Soviet crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a great desire on the part of Americans to know what we might 
do . . . what the President of the United States can do" about the situation, 
Bush said. "It's not that clear." 
</P>
<P>
The latest Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania threatens the Baltic republic with an 
embargo of oil and other vital products unless it backs down on its challenge 
to Moscow over its declaration of independence within two days. 
</P>
<P>
Bush described the threat by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov as "deeply disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
"Coercion, escalation is not the way to go," he added. "The answer is dialogue 
and peaceful change." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, when asked about Lithuania, said improvement in East-West relations 
"could not continue" if the Soviets use force there. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not lecturing anyone, but we are entitled to express a view," she added, 
referring to Gorbachev's complaint Thursday to visiting U.S. senators about 
Western "lectures" on the subject. "We have a duty to say what we think." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, as Bush flew here for four hours of talks with the British 
leader, he told reporters aboard Air Force One that he feels the time has come 
to "forgive" Germany for the Holocaust, a remark that drew protests from some 
Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect to the President, it is not in the power of people living 
now to forgive" those who committed "the most horrific crimes ever," said Rabbi 
Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. "The only people who 
have the right to forgive are the victims, and they're not here any more." 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Parliament Thursday asked forgiveness for Nazi crimes, 
abandoning that country's past insistence that it bore no responsibility for 
the Holocaust because its Communist founders had fought Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, calling his comments a "personal observation," not official policy, said, 
"I'm a Christian, and I think forgiveness is something that I feel very 
strongly about." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm inclined to think we ought to forgive -- not forget," he said, adding that 
the Easter season is a "very special time of the year . . . a time to take 
stock." 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who have faith, most of the teachings have ample room for 
forgiveness and moving on," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hier said he feared Bush's comments would be "counterproductive" and encourage 
those in Germany who hope unification of the country will put an end to 
discussion of the Nazi past. 
</P>
<P>
German unification and the resulting changes in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization were the main subject of the Bush-Thatcher talks. There was a 
"very wide measure of agreement" between the two, Thatcher said, "just as you 
would expect." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, however, the two leaders disagree substantially on at least one major 
issue: whether and how to add new nuclear weapons to NATO's arsenal in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Before last year's dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, NATO drafted plans to 
install new short-range nuclear weapons in West Germany that would be capable 
of hitting targets in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher still supports those plans. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO will continue to need a mix of conventional and nuclear weapons, and they 
must be kept up to date," she said. "That does, of course, include short-range 
nuclear weapons." Officially, the Bush Administration sides with Thatcher, and 
Bush has asked Congress for money for more missiles. Privately, however, 
Administration officials concede that the plans are obsolete. German leaders 
oppose any new nuclear weapons on their territory and Congress is resisting the 
idea of spending money for them. 
</P>
<P>
Bush ducked the issue when asked about it, but an Administration official 
confirmed that no progress had been made in reconciling the British and 
American views. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also issued a statement commemorating the December, 1988, 
bombing of a Pan Am jet bound from London to New York. Relatives of the victims 
had presented the two leaders with a petition asking for more action to find 
those who committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to solve that terrible tragedy more than we do," said Thatcher. 
"But we simply can't pull solutions out of a hat." 
</P>
<P>
The talks here were part of an intensive round of discussions Bush has had with 
foreign leaders since his December summit with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4 1/2 months since the Malta meeting, Bush has met with every major 
Western leader at least once, in some cases twice. Next week, he will travel to 
the Florida Keys to meet with French President Francois Mitterrand, whom he saw 
on the Caribbean island of St. Martin in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has had so many meetings, in fact, that White House aides have lost count. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three different lists -- they disagree," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the meetings have mixed business with some sort of recreation, in the 
now-familiar Bush style. This time, the chosen event was kite flying, a Bermuda 
tradition on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a blustery wind under rainy skies outside Government House here, Bush and 
Thatcher each briefly tugged at kite strings and talked to small children 
before heading back indoors. The wind nearly forced cancellation of the event. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, on his way to a reception that preceded dinner with Thatcher at 
the Governor-General's Residence, the President plunged into a crowd of 400 to 
500 cheering bystanders to shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
The President is scheduled to play a round of golf today before flying back to 
Washington.

GORBACHEV DOCUMENTS SOVIET GUILT AT KATYN

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, seeking to defuse the single biggest issue 
poisoning relations between the Soviet Union and neighboring Poland, gave 
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski documents Friday that showed that Soviet 
secret police killed thousands of Polish army officers during World War II and 
buried them in mass graves in a Russian forest. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic admission from the Kremlin, accompanied by an expression of regret 
for what an official statement called "one of the gravest crimes of Stalinism," 
was a clear effort by Gorbachev to shore up relations with a key Warsaw Pact 
nation as East Germany and other socialist countries drift further westward. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow, in a statement carried by the official news agency Tass, reversed 
almost half a century of denials in admitting that its secret police had killed 
4,000 soldiers whose bodies were found in 1940 in the Katyn Forest near 
Smolensk, southwest of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass statement added that another 11,000 Polish soldiers disappeared, but 
did not detail their fate. Historians, however, believe they also were 
massacred. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were among about 130,000 Polish soldiers who were in the part of 
prewar Poland taken over by Moscow in 1939 as part of a nonaggression pact 
between Soviet leader Josef Stalin and Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin apparently ordered some of the troops killed because he feared that they 
"might in the future enter the struggle for their country's rebirth," according 
to Soviet historian Natalya Lebedeva, whose views were published last month in 
the progressive weekly Moscow News. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis later occupied the area around Katyn and in 1942 revealed the 
discovery of the mass graves. After trying to pass it off as a medieval burial 
site, the Soviet Union contended that the Poles had been shot by German troops 
in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
When Poland's government in exile in London demanded more evidence, Stalin 
angrily broke off ties with what he described as a "hostile" Polish leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Western countries largely ignored the massacre or accepted 
Stalin's version of events. But by the 1950s, Western historians were blaming 
the Soviets for the killings. Moscow continued to deny that it had any role in 
the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski and Gorbachev agreed in 1987 to set up a commission to study World 
War II events at Katyn. In November, Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, 
after a visit to Katyn, demanded "moral compensation" for those who died. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's meeting, Gorbachev gave Jaruzelski copies of documents from Soviet 
archives, which reportedly were only recently discovered and which dealt with 
Polish soldiers held in Soviet prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
Tass did not report further details of the meeting, but Jaruzelski said earlier 
this week that he expected the two leaders would discuss the reunification of 
Germany and the future of Soviet troops on Polish soil. Jaruzelski is to visit 
Katyn today. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Katyn damaged relations between Poland and the Soviet Union 
for decades. There had been speculation that Gorbachev would discuss the Katyn 
incident during his official visit to Poland last year, but he avoided the 
topic. By choosing to reveal the guilt of Soviet secret police now, Gorbachev 
was making an obvious overture to Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is seriously concerned about the future of the Warsaw Pact, particularly 
as East Germany's new leaders have indicated they would support a united 
Germany's becoming a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if the 
Western Alliance establishes an all-European strategic system. The Soviet Union 
has repeatedly said it finds that proposal unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was seeking to demonstrate once again that he and his government are 
vastly different from any previous Soviet leaders. It was not immediately 
clear, however, how much good the Soviet admission would accomplish in Poland, 
where perceptions of Moscow are colored, perhaps irreversibly, by years of 
false denials regarding Katyn. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the 11,000 Polish officers whose fates were not detailed by the 
Soviet statement, for instance, have long demanded and are still seeking a full 
explanation of what happened to the troops. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's admission also answers growing calls in this country for greater 
Soviet forthrightness on the issue. On Sunday, for instance, the Medecinskaya 
Gazeta called for publication of official medical reports regarding the Katyn 
killings, contending that most of the victims were killed with a bullet in the 
back of the neck and some bore wounds produced by Soviet-made bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his effort at glasnost, or greater openness, Gorbachev has sought to 
fill in the so-called blank spaces in Soviet history and particularly to 
publicly reveal the crimes of Stalin, whose bloody period of dictatorship is 
referred to here euphemistically as the "Cult of the Personality." 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin statement clearly blamed the massacre on Stalin and his NKVD, the 
brutal forerunner of the modern KGB secret police. It singled out by name NKVD 
Chief Lavrenti Beria and his protege V. N. Merkulov. 
</P>
<P>
"Just recently, Soviet archive workers and historians discovered some documents 
concerning Polish servicemen," the Soviet statement said. "It follows from 
these documents that in April-May, 1940, 394 of the 15,000 or so Polish 
officers kept in the three camps (in Kozelsk, Starobelsk and Ostashkov) were 
transferred to the Gryazovetsk camp" in northern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"The larger part, however, were turned over to the NKVD administrations . . . 
and never mentioned in NKVD statistical accounts again," the statement said. 
"The Soviet side expresses deep regret."

NASA PROTECTS TELESCOPE DURING DELAY

The $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most valuable payload, will be 
exposed to minimal contamination inside Discovery while it awaits a second 
launch attempt, the agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kept this vehicle extremely clean," said Fred Wojtalik, a NASA project 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more dust is expected to settle on the telescope's 94-inch mirror, the 
finest ever made, Wojtalik said. But the additional debris still will be well 
within contamination limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done all the cautionary things that we can," he said. "We're going to 
get some degradation. Some particles are going to come into the Hubble that we 
just can't avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Once the telescope reaches orbit, scientists want no more than 5% of the 
surface of Hubble's 94-inch mirror covered with dust or other debris, Wojtalik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 2% rate of contamination was expected had Discovery been launched on time 
Tuesday, Wojtalik said. That is expected to rise to 2.1% as a result of the 
delay until the new launch date, April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Clean air was being circulated inside Discovery's sealed payload bay Friday to 
reduce contamination of the telescope. NASA planned to open the payload bay 
Saturday so the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries can be removed and taken 
to a Kennedy Space Center laboratory for recharging. 
</P>
<P>
A protective cover will not be placed over the telescope's aperture door 
because the procedure is difficult and might result in even more contamination 
or damage, Wojtalik said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's launch was postponed four minutes before liftoff Tuesday when one 
of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units failed. Technicians will replace 
the unit with a new one this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time NASA has ever replaced an auxiliary power unit at the 
launch pad. As a result, the space agency has told technicians to take their 
time and that "there is no schedule pressure there." 
</P>
<P>
Hubble is to orbit 380 miles high, studying stars and galaxies so distant that 
their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years. Scientists 
believe the universe was created about 15 billion years ago.

RESULTS 'SPOTTY' IN D.C. DRUG WAR, BENNETT SAYS;

One year after he pledged to make the District of Columbia a "test case" in the 
nation's drug war, national drug policy director William J. Bennett said Friday 
that the results of federal efforts here have been "mixed, spotty, incomplete" 
but that he had no intention of abandoning the city. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the city's homicide rate remains at a near-record level, Bennett 
said, there are "encouraging" signs that the worst days of the drug epidemic 
here may be over. 
</P>
<P>
The number of hospital emergency room patients reporting drug use dropped 13% 
in 1989, after more than doubling between 1986 and 1989, he said. In addition, 
in urinalysis drug testing at D.C. Superior Court, 60% of defendants showed 
positive for cocaine or other drugs -- down from a peak of 73% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital emergency room admissions and drug testing of arrestees are considered 
key indicators of drug abuse. But Bennett aides acknowledged that they are not 
certain what caused the declines and that it is too early to say they represent 
a long-term trend. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Washington is still in trouble," Bennett said at a news 
conference. "Work in some very serious areas . . . is not as far along as I'd 
like to see. But progress in some other serious areas has been made and 
shouldn't be minimized." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was joined at the news conference by Sterling Tucker, the District of 
Columbia's director of drug control policy. Both officials avoided the type of 
acrimony that has marked relations between Bennett's office and D.C. officials. 
</P>
<P>
"On balance, I would have to say the federal government is meeting its 
commitment to the District of Columbia," Tucker said. "Now we are hopeful there 
will be new commitments." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett refused to be drawn into a discussion of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry -- an 
earlier target of his unflattering remarks -- and of Barry's upcoming trial on 
cocaine possession and perjury charges. However, Barry was absent from the list 
of city officials singled out by Bennett for praise. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett had called the news conference to fulfill a promise to give semiannual 
reports on the D.C. anti-drug initiative that he announced last year. The plan, 
which at the time was estimated to cost $80 million, called for the creation of 
a multi-agency law enforcement task force, the construction of a new federal 
prison in the area and a 500-bed pretrial detention facility in the city, more 
federal prosecutors, the eviction of drug dealers from public housing 
development and new "model" drug treatment clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett acknowledged that some of the major elements of the plan never got off 
the ground. The federal prison, the costliest element, was scrapped within a 
week because of political opposition to a proposed site in Anne Arundel County, 
Md. "This project has now entered the American 'not-in-my-back-yard syndrome' 
lore, and enough said about it," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
There is still no agreed-on site for the pretrial detention facility. In 
addition, federal officials acknowledge that no new treatment beds for addicts 
have been added as a result of the Bennett initiative.

<P>
For nearly nine years, through deportation from her native Poland and war's 
devastation, Helena Krahelska kept her husband's shoes and shirts waiting. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1948, she acknowledged that her beloved Piotr must have been among the 
Polish army officers massacred early in World War II by the Soviets in Katyn 
Forest in the western Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Soviet government 42 more years to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
The massacre of thousands of Polish officers has seared the national 
consciousness for 50 years. On Friday, Poles received Moscow's official 
acknowledgement that Josef Stalin's secret police were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
A statement and apology by the official Soviet news agency Tass reversed 
decades of insistence that the Nazis murdered 4,000 Polish officers. The bodies 
of 11,000 others were never found; Tass referred to these soldiers as having 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that my mother could not live until this day," said a tearful Wanda 
Zadrozna, Krahelska's daughter. "There is a great regret that it took 50 years 
and the wives of those people didn't live until this day. But whatever happens 
now, it is good that the truth will be finally written in history." 
</P>
<P>
The Tass statement came during a three-day Soviet visit by Polish President 
Wojciech Jaruzelski. Jaruzelski met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and planned to visit Katyn today. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, Poland acknowledged Moscow's admission, but demanded clarification 
of other "blank spots" in the two countries' history. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet admission of the crime committed on the Polish officers in Katyn 
was long-awaited. The event which took place 50 years ago in the woods near 
Smolensk painfully overshadowed relations between our two nations," a 
government statement said. 
</P>
<P>
But it added: "Reconciliation can only be built on truth. Acknowledging the 
importance of the official statement by the Soviet side, we expect 
clarification of all so-called blank spots in our common history, of which the 
symbol for us Poles was the Katyn massacre." 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British government welcomed Moscow's admission. Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said the "terrible things" that Stalin did cannot be 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that criminals admit their crimes," Solidarity leader Lech Walesa 
said in Gdansk. Walesa called the Soviet admission "an act of moral justice 
which has been awaited for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
He said there must also be "punishment of those guilty of the genocide," 
reparations stemming from the Soviet occupation of eastern Poland in 1939 and 
free access to Soviet territory that is "emotionally important" for Poles. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a great joy now that after so many years the truth has been revealed," 
said Bozena Lojek, whose father-in-law died at Katyn. "For us, it is a great 
success," and will lead to "many political and economic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
For Zadrozna, who was 12 when she last saw her father, the memories cut deep. 
</P>
<P>
"We got three letters, the last one was from March 5, 1940," Zadrozna recalled. 
"Then no one got any letters any more." 
</P>
<P>
While Poland's Communist governments echoed the Soviet explanation that the 
Nazis were to blame, most historians concluded that the massacre was committed 
by Stalin's secret police in late April and early May, 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been missing those people for so many years," Zadrozna said. "They 
were not ordinary people. They were people of science, good, wise people and, 
unfortunately, nothing can make up for this loss."

LITHUANIA REACHES 'POLITICAL DEAD END' -- TEXT OF SOVIET LETTER

<P>
Here is the text of the letter that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent to the Lithuanian leadership, as carried 
by the official Tass news agency. It was translated into English by Tass: 
</P>
<P>
Artificially and illicitly provoked by the Lithuanian leadership, the issue of 
the republic's position in the federal state tightens into an ever-tighter 
knot, assuming the nature of a political dead end. 
</P>
<P>
Despite constructive and well-considered measures by the supreme bodies of 
state authority of the U.S.S.R., which would enhance Lithuanian sovereignty 
within the constitutional framework, the republic's leadership continues to 
adopt legislative acts and decisions that set Lithuania in opposition to other 
republics and the Soviet Union as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
On April 5, for instance, a law was adopted, "on identity cards for citizens of 
the Lithuanian republic" that discriminates against Soviet citizens who are 
willing to live and work in accordance with the constitution and laws of the 
U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet's decision to halt spring conscription activities 
in the republic is a flagrant violation of the U.S.S.R. Law on General Military 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers' resolution "on measures to 
protect the property of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the 
territory of the Lithuanian S.S.R. (Soviet Socialist Republic)," republican 
authorities are making illegitimate attempts to seize this property. 
</P>
<P>
Such actions, the list of which continues, can no longer be tolerated. They aim 
to undermine political and socioeconomic stability in the country, damage 
democratic processes and seriously infringe on Soviet citizens' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Other constituent republics are asking quite aptly why they should continue 
supplying products to Lithuania at the expense of their own needs, while the 
latter's steering agencies continue their anti-constitutional actions and 
disregard the rightful interests of the integral national economy and the 
country's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In this situation, we are compelled to issue the following warning: If the 
Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian S.S.R. do not 
rescind the above decisions within the next two days, instructions will be 
given to stop supplies to the Lithuanian S.S.R. from other constituent 
republics of those categories of products that are sold on external markets for 
freely convertible currency. 
</P>
<P>
We do not want things to go as far as this measure, but the situation now fully 
depends on the Lithuanian leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we reaffirm once again that we look to the Lithuanian Supreme 
Soviet and the Council of Ministers to take decisions that will restore the 
republic's position to that of March 10, 1990. This would make it possible to 
begin dealing with the entire package of issues without delay.

FORMER OPPOSITION FIGURES STILL BEING BUGGED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Czechoslovak opposition figures -- some of them now in the government -- 
are still being monitored through electronic devices, a Socialist Party 
newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Devaty, former spokesman for the human rights group Charter 77, found 
a new bugging device in his apartment several days ago and sent a letter of 
inquiry to non-Communist Interior Minister Richard Sacher. 
</P>
<P>
Charter 77 was founded in Czechoslovakia in 1977 to monitor the former 
Communist government's compliance with human rights accords of the Helsinki 
agreements signed by all European nations but Albania. Many of its spokesmen 
and supporters were persecuted and some, including Devaty, were imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
Devaty told the Socialist Party newspaper Svobodne Slovo that one bugging 
device he found earlier "had been rendered ineffective" by his neighbor. But 
then he found a microphone with a new cable leading to it "and wondered to whom 
to return the microphone because the state security no longer exists." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second case this week of electronic eavesdropping being uncovered, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
A bugging device was dismantled in the flat of Jan Urban, a member of the board 
of the main non-Communist umbrella group Civic Forum and a key adviser to 
President Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party was the first of the legal, Communist-allied parties to 
break its ties and join ranks with the Civic Forum in the demonstrations last 
November that toppled the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
Sacher, who has the job of dismantling the nation's state police operation, has 
proposed establishing job-training centers for unemployed security police. He 
also has said there is no immediate threat of armed action by those police, but 
that some of them should be kept to combat terrorism and drug abuse because 
they are highly trained. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of continued secret activities by factions opposed to democratic 
reform is a persistent one in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, the former Communist Party was damaged by a scandal in which 
opposition parties' telephones were tapped. In Poland, Interior Minister 
Czeslaw Kiszczak endorsed legislation requiring the approval of both himself 
and the prosecutor general for any telephone tapping of suspected criminals.

China has launched a three-year campaign to stop the nation's toilets from 
leaking, confident that it has overcome the defects of socialist plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
Dripping toilet systems in countless Chinese homes are wasting 200 million tons 
of water a year, the official Economic Information newspaper said Friday. A 
unified toilet system, central planning and cooperation between departments 
could plug all leaks in three years, the newspaper said.

ARREST STUNS INDIAN ARTIFACT DEALERS; 
</P>

MONEY LAUNDERING: A WELL-KNOWN EXPERT IS ACCUSED OF AIDING DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

<P>
In the marketplace for antique American Indian artifacts, Mark Winter is known 
as a man with a Midas touch. 
</P>
<P>
He forged his reputation in the mid-1970s when he parlayed a small personal 
loan into a world-class collection of rare Navajo rugs later exhibited at 
museums across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But federal drug agents who arrested Winter, 39, last week charge that the 
consulting services he provided extended beyond chichi auction houses and 
galleries to include drug traffickers seeking to launder money by investing in 
American Indian rugs, baskets and pottery. 
</P>
<P>
Winter's arrest at a Phoenix hotel by agents of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration has stunned art dealers from New York to roadside trading posts 
in the New Mexican desert. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," said Bernard de Grunne, in charge of the African and American 
art department at Sotheby's auction house in New York. "He was the most 
prominent Navajo textile weaving dealer in America." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the subsequent seizure of artifacts valued at $5 million from vaults 
in and near Winter's home in the southern Colorado town of Pagosa Springs has 
horrified legitimate collectors who had entrusted weavings to him for storage 
and fear that their irreplaceable items are being mishandled by federal 
authorities, who are hardly art conservators. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to allay such fears, Jack Egnor, the U.S. marshal in Denver, has 
turned over the job of handling artifacts in his custody to members of the 
Colorado Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Richard Ballantine, who purchased 75% of a famed collection put 
together by Winter and one of his associates, is still concerned. The so-called 
Durango Collection includes the oldest example of Navajo weaving in existence, 
and Ballantine elected to keep it in Winter's vault. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I are very concerned about the condition of the weavings -- they 
are delicate and fragile and need to be stored quite carefully," said 
Ballantine, publisher of the Durango Herald in Durango, Colo. "We are looking 
forward to talking to Mark about all this when he is out on bail." 
</P>
<P>
Winter was arrested after he met with an undercover agent investigating a major 
drug ring that smuggled marijuana from Thailand and involved suspects in Mexico 
and Carlsbad, Calif., a spokesman for the DEA said. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation started about two years ago and it is still going on," said 
Joseph Moody of the DEA office in Carlsbad, who refused to discuss details of 
the case. "Winter is just one of the rocks we picked up along the road." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a money-laundering scheme involves investing illegally obtained 
money in a bank account or real estate, then later obtaining "clean money" by 
withdrawing the funds or selling the property. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, federal agents allege, Winter took drug money and invested it in 
Indian artifacts that would hold their value or appreciate. Winter allegedly 
purchased the items in his own name and stored them at his business but 
recorded their true ownership in a secret portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The agents contend that the case illustrates the creative ways in which drug 
dealers have sought to launder their profits and how this money has become 
financially intertwined in everything from jewelry stores and foreign bank 
accounts to oil paintings and American Indian rugs. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with search warrants and powerful drills used to pierce the steel walls 
of Winter's vaults, the agents confiscated all of the artifacts in his 
possession, along with his home, condominium, BMW automobile and coin 
collections. They plan to conduct an inventory to determine which items, if 
any, were purchased for drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Winter, who was being held at the county jail in Phoenix pending extradition to 
San Diego, could not be reached for comment. But his attorney, Richard Barnett, 
said his client is "totally innocent." 
</P>
<P>
"The government has made allegations that my client sold some Indian artifacts 
to people who turned out to be drug dealers," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that my client had an extremely large business and it is not 
clear whether he made any sales to these individuals," Barnett added. "Nor is 
there any evidence he ever knowingly sold items to people he knew to be drug 
dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Winter's friends and business associates in southern Colorado said they 
were saddened, but not surprised, by his legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Winter, they recalled, started out in Pagosa Springs in 1974 as a sandal-clad 
"hippie type" who hawked artifacts out of the back of a van that sometimes 
served as his sleeping quarters on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years of hard work and intense study later, Winter opened a business in 
Pagosa Springs that was called American Renaissance and offered weavings and 
advice to elite collectors and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"When he started out, he was a sweet, humble young man who worked like hell and 
even built a house with his own hands," said Jackson Clark, who owns a bottling 
company in Durango and lent Winter the money to build the Durango Collection. 
</P>
<P>
"But he changed about two years ago when he got involved with those New York 
auctioners who asked him for advice," Clark said. "He became impossibly 
arrogant, going back to New York, Boston and Florida for 10 days at a time with 
a platinum American Express card and a cellular phone." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Winter, 38, who separated from her husband two years ago and has since 
moved away from Pagosa Springs with their three children, held out hope. "I 
feel the legal problems are unfortunate and unfounded," Mrs. Winter said. "I 
have faith in Mark."

347 ARRESTED AT PROTEST OVER ABORTION

Nearly 350 people attempting to prevent women from having abortions on Good 
Friday were arrested outside a city health center during a peaceful 
demonstration by activists on both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Police said about 800 people, both opponents and supporters of legal abortion, 
demonstrated outside the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center for Women. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents of abortion, praying and singing, were surrounded by an even 
larger and more vocal group of abortion rights advocates who chanted and yelled 
obscenities from behind police barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic Director Jean Hunt said most of the 20 abortions scheduled Friday were 
performed despite the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Protest organizers nevertheless insisted that no abortions were performed. 
</P>
<P>
Police began making arrests about 11 a.m., lifting anti-abortionists onto 
stretchers and carrying them into buses. The 347 protesters were taken to a 
temporary holding facility at Family Court where they were issued citations for 
blocking a public highway and released. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Philip Berg, who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor 
as an abortion rights advocate, attended the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McMonagle, a spokesman for the opponents of abortion, said the Good 
Friday demonstration is traditionally the group's largest of the year. He said 
it is held at the Blackwell clinic because most others are closed for the 
Christian holiday.

RETURN RATE FOR CENSUS FORMS RISES TO 59%

<P>
The Census Bureau said Friday that the nation's lethargic rate of census 
returns jumped by 2 percentage points in 24 hours to 59%, with Wisconsin, Iowa 
and other Midwestern states leading the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Stand up and be counted now!" Census Bureau Director Barbara Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fill out and return your 1990 census forms this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census has been plagued by reports of foul-ups, confusion, missed 
addresses, housing units that do not show up on official lists, undelivered 
forms and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, Bryant warned that the national mail response 
rate was an alarming 57% -- far lower than expected for the nationwide count, 
held every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The government hoped to have a 70% return of the 90 million census forms that 
were put in the mail at the end of March, and Bryant blamed some of the slow 
response on "sociological trends such as the dual career couple." 
</P>
<P>
According to its latest estimates, released Friday, "Wisconsin remains ahead in 
statewide returns of census forms, with 73.4%, closely followed by Iowa, at 
72.2%." 
</P>
<P>
"Both states added 1 percentage point overnight, while the nationwide tally of 
census returns jumped 2 points to 59%." 
</P>
<P>
South Dakota, Minnesota, Ohio, North Dakota, Indiana and Michigan were close 
behind, officials said.

PENTAGON, IN EFFICIENCY QUEST, TO MERGE COMMISSARY SYSTEMS

The separate Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps commissary systems and 
supply depot operations will be merged to streamline operations and provide 
better service, the Pentagon announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The four systems, a Pentagon statement said, "constitute one of the largest 
grocery store operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidating them into a single organization will achieve the kinds of 
efficiencies and economies available to a commercial grocery store chain." 
</P>
<P>
There are 413 commissaries in the four branches of the military services, 
Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Defense Department study indicated that consolidation would save about 
$90 million a year and improve service to members of the armed services and 
their families, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The department also intends to consolidate the supply depot operations of the 
military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. The first consolidation 
will take place among the five depots in the San Francisco Bay area, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The department's 35 supply depots in the United States operate 3,400 
warehouses, storing supplies valued at $95 billion, plus $23 billion worth of 
ammunition, the statement said.

Hundreds of radical students demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops fought 
riot police with firebombs in the provincial city of Taejon, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The protests were fueled by rumors that the U.S. Army would move its South 
Korean headquarters from Seoul, the capital, to Taejon. "Expel U.S. soldiers!" 
about 1,000 students yelled as they marched from Chungnam University, according 
to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. Police fired tear gas to break up the 
protest. About 800 students at Taejon's Gongju University also fought police to 
demand a U.S. pullout, Yonhap said.

Three European hostages freed this week in Beirut were captured by Col. Moammar 
Kadafi's government and held in Libya, not Lebanon, the Paris daily Le Figaro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The French government said it could not confirm or deny the report. The 
newspaper cited unnamed sources in Paris, Brussels and Beirut as saying the 
government of Algeria -- and not Kadafi -- served as the principal mediator in 
negotiations to free the hostages, Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 32, Belgian 
Fernand Houtekins, 42, and their daughter, Sophie, 2. France's Socialist 
government has come under international criticism for commending Kadafi for his 
role in freeing the captives.

LOGGERS SAY FIGHT TO SAVE OWL ENDANGERS JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: 13,000 RALLY AGAINST A PLAN THAT WOULD PLACE UP TO 40% OF 
NORTHWEST TIMBERLAND OFF LIMITS TO THE INDUSTRY.

PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loggers put down their chain saws Friday, piled into trucks and set out from 
hamlets like Sweet Home and Myrtle Creek to tell their city-dwelling cousins 
that the fight to save a rare species of owl is endangering the livelihood of 
people who depend on timber. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 13,000 tree fallers, truck drivers, mill workers and their families 
overflowed Pioneer Square in the center of Portland for a boisterous noontime 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Logging trucks, vans and pick-ups, all with yellow ribbons trailing, rolled up 
Interstate 5 to Portland all morning. An estimated 350 small and large 
businesses throughout rural Oregon closed for the day so workers could attend, 
shutting down most commerce in several small towns in a show of support for 
rural Oregon's No. 1 industry. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming tens of thousands of timber jobs are at stake, organizers from a group 
called the Oregon Lands Coalition called the rally to protest a proposal made 
earlier this month that would ban logging on as much as 40% of the available 
timberland in the Pacific Northwest in order to save the rare northern spotted 
owl. 
</P>
<P>
"I have reached the limit of my patience," proclaimed Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.), one of several politicians who vowed at the rally to fight efforts to 
preserve additional timberland. 
</P>
<P>
"You have got to make a stand," said Phil Britt, 37, a tree faller from 
Carlton, Ore., who joined the crowd packing the square. Fearing that he could 
lose his job and his small town would "dry up and blow away," Britt gave up a 
day's wage to demonstrate. "You can't sit back and think it won't happen here, 
because it just might," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the square, a contingent from Zipo Logs, a mill in Eugene, Ore., 
bemoaned the prospect of closing down if the virgin forest land that is the 
spotted owl's habitat is declared off limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We could always go to work for McDonald's," mill worker John Wilhelm said. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to be around to buy hamburgers?" Doug Updegrave shot back, his 
pregnant wife, Christy, standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I know -- mill work. I can't afford to go back to school," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several loggers and mill workers in the crowd talked about how their fathers 
and grandfathers were loggers before them. Many said they fear they will be 
forced to leave their small towns for big cities if more timberland is closed 
to chain saws. The thought of big city traffic and raising kids in a place 
where they wouldn't know their neighbors did not sit well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to where you can't even cut a tree," complained Guy Walker, a 
third-generation logger from Lyons, Ore., who brought his 7-year-old daughter 
Bridie. If work gets much harder to find, he said, he might be forced to 
consider a new trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I like working in the woods," he said. "The freedom. You don't have anybody 
standing over your shoulder. Just being outside." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event said that even though Portland's economy benefits from 
logging, many residents side with the old growth forests -- the kind most 
valued by loggers because of their density -- against lumber interests. But 
they hoped to convince people in Portland, home to half the state's population, 
that owls and people can co-exist. 
</P>
<P>
The fight is uphill. 
</P>
<P>
"Rightly or wrongly, people up here think this is God's acre," Chris Tobkin, 
executive assistant to Portland Mayor J.E. Bud Clark, noted after the rally. 
"They don't like anyone who might do it damage, whether it be a California 
developer or a timber company executive." 
</P>
<P>
In rural Oregon, mills have been shutting down for years as old growth stands 
are depleted as a resource by timber fallers and are protected by 
environmentalists. But in the past year, the spotted owl has emerged as the 
symbol of a fight over the remaining old growth stands that is as bitter as any 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers say nothing less than their right to live and work as they choose is at 
stake. Environmentalists, trying to save what's left of the forests, contend 
the owl needs them to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the fight escalated when a panel of government scientists issued a 
report concluding that continued logging of the old growth stands was 
threatening the spotted owl with extinction. The report called for a ban on up 
to 40% of the available timberland in the Pacific Northwest in order to protect 
the subspecies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requested the report to help 
it decide by June 23 whether to classify the bird as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
The report's release prompted the Oregon Lands Coalition to organize Friday's 
rally. In the burg of Sweet Home, convincing people to join in was easy. The 
town of about 7,000 people 100 miles south of Portland had six mills a few 
years back. Now it has three. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the owl to survive. We don't want the last tree in Oregon cut," said 
John Kunzman, part of a third-generation timber family and one of the main 
organizers. "But how far is this going to go before people count, too." 
</P>
<P>
The town has tried to diversify. But Mayor Dave Holley noted that a plant that 
makes metal detectors and one that processes organic baby food do not make up 
for the 350 timber jobs that have disappeared in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
So with a feeling of some desperation, the citizenry started massing at dawn. 
Perhaps 3,000 went to Portland. Some chain stores stayed open, but everything 
else, from the Busy Bee Drive-in to Arlie Elliott's real estate company, was 
closed tight. In all, more than 100 businesses closed. 
</P>
<P>
Barb Walker, who has poured coffee at the Spring Restaurant in the heart of 
Sweet Home for the past 27 years, filled a few last cups before closing for the 
day about 7:30 a.m. No one had to ask her to close. When word spread about the 
rally, she said: "It was a matter of honor" that the Spring would shut down, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's loyalty," Walker said, estimating that 97% of her customers work in the 
woods or mills. "You just can't turn your back on the people who supported 
you."

Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, the latest candidate in the Democratic gubernatorial 
field, acknowledged he is being treated for depression but his opponents Friday 
shied away from making it an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Chiles, 60, readily admitted Thursday that he has been treated for the last 
year with Prozac, a costly anti-depressant drug that came onto the market in 
late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had known about Prozac earlier because it has helped me," said 
Chiles, who added that his condition stemmed partly from his retirement from 
the Senate in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had depression and sought treatment," Chiles told the Palm Beach Post. 
The Post attributed the initial report about his ailment to unidentified 
"Republican officials," but GOP officials Friday distanced themselves from the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was depressed about what was going on in the state," joked Chiles, 
who said he takes one pill a day and feels great. "Now I'm going to do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Chiles said in a telephone interview Friday that his treatment is near 
completion. "I think I'm finishing up," Chiles said. "It has really helped me. 
I really feel great." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Chiles' two Democratic opponents said that their candidates were 
healthy and that Chiles' depression was not presently an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not making it an issue, certainly at this stage," said Don Pride, press 
secretary for Rep. Bill Nelson, who had been considered the Democratic 
front-runner until Chiles' entry. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pride said Chiles' decision to leave the Senate after his third term 
because the senator claimed to be "burned out" was an issue.

KAUFMAN'S BIRD COURT REMARKS ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the state Supreme Court under former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth 
Bird disagreed sharply Friday with charges by retiring Justice Marcus M. 
Kaufman that the court had delayed capital cases because of personal opposition 
to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen anyone who worked harder than Chief Justice Bird to get 
those decisions out," said former Justice Cruz Reynoso, who along with Bird and 
Justice Joseph R. Grodin was defeated by the voters in the fall, 1986, 
election. "Any notion to the contrary belies the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to think that Justice Kaufman was speaking without knowing what the 
situation was at the time," Reynoso said, adding wryly: "Clearly the tradition 
of justices speaking through their court opinions rather than press conferences 
makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Allen E. Broussard, who has served on the state high court since 1981, 
said: "When Justice Kaufman was on the court, I frequently had to bite my 
tongue; maybe it's just best to continue to bite my tongue after he retires." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Stanley Mosk, another former member of the Bird Court, declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1987 after Bird, Reynoso and 
Grodin were ousted, retired at the end of January. He charged at a farewell 
news conference Thursday that the Bird court had sought to undermine the death 
penalty by delaying cases and reversing an inordinate number of capital 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-year period ending in 1986, the liberal-dominated court under Bird 
affirmed four death sentences and reversed 64. Since then, under Chief Justice 
Malcolm M. Lucas, the new and more conservative court has upheld 66 death 
sentences and overturned 25. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the Bird court rejected Kaufman's allegations, contending that, at 
the time of the rulings, much more effort was required to resolve the complex 
issues surrounding capital punishment. The Bird court's work in clarifying the 
law has enabled the current court to decide cases faster, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso, now practicing law in Sacramento, noted that in the early 1980s the 
high court was faced with interpreting a 1977 law enacted by the Legislature 
that reinstated capital punishment. A subsequent 1978 initiative that expanded 
the law -- an initiative widely criticized as poorly drafted -- also required 
interpretation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court was in the midst of deciding key 
constitutional questions that affected California cases. 
</P>
<P>
"All that brought a great deal of uncertainty to the law," Reynoso said. "By 
the time Justice Kaufman got to the court, the law was pretty well clarified, 
and clearly the percentage of death sentences affirmed was going to go up." 
</P>
<P>
Grodin also defended the Bird court, saying he thought the court did a "good 
job" in working out the problems in the 1978 law. He said Kaufman's remarks 
were like newcomers to the West complaining about how long it took the pioneers 
before them to clear the land and till the fields. 
</P>
<P>
"When Justice Kaufman got there, there wasn't all that much to do," Grodin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern 
California criticized Kaufman's contention that defense lawyers and civil 
libertarians had sought to circumvent widespread public support for the death 
penalty by making it so expensive and burdensome on the courts that it could 
not be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply disturbed that a justice of the Supreme Court would seem to be 
more concerned with public opinion polls than the Constitution," said Dorothy 
M. Ehrlich, executive director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"Even proponents of the death penalty don't want to see an execution that is a 
miscarriage of justice. We have to look to the appellate courts to be above 
politics and above the fray," she said.

Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie sought an injunction in San Francisco 
Superior Court Friday to prevent the governing board of the California 
Automobile Assigned Risk Plan from going ahead with its plan on May 1 to stop 
accepting new applicants who qualify as "good drivers" under Proposition 103. A 
hearing was set for Tuesday. Gillespie's attorneys said such a stoppage would 
make auto insurance unavailable to thousands of low-income inner-city 
residents.

A Northern California church group is trying to ban from stores a line of 
greeting cards that contain condoms. 
</P>
<P>
The greeting cards are being test marketed in Redding, Chico, Sacramento, Reno 
and elsewhere. The distributor, "Condom-Wise" of Redding, says they are 
designed to promote AIDS awareness. But Pastor Burt Smith of the Little Country 
Church in Palo Cedro says the cards violate Christian beliefs. Smith says he 
has collected more than 300 signatures on a petition seeking the ban.

INS SEEKS 18% HIKE IN BORDER STAFFING

<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary is seeking 
to increase Border Patrol staffing in San Diego by about 18%, to 1,000 agents, 
perhaps by the end of this year, his chief spokesman said. The hirings would 
make 1990 the year in which the San Diego branch of the agency received its 
largest staff increase ever. 
</P>
<P>
The steep increase would follow a yearlong, 1989 hiring freeze that left the 
patrol severely undermanned, officials said. The expansions are targeted at 
understaffed San Diego -- the busiest illicit crossing along the almost 
2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border -- and do not represent increases nationwide, 
said Verne Jervis, spokesman for INS Commissioner McNary. Jervis and McNary 
visited the San Diego-Tijuana border area this week.

L.A.'S HOUSING AGENCY HELM WILL BE TAKEN BY N.Y. OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending a yearlong search, Mayor Tom Bradley and housing officials Friday 
announced the selection of New York City's chief operating officer of public 
housing to run Los Angeles' 21 scattered and troubled housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Shuldiner, 45, who takes on the $135,000-a-year job as director of the 
Los Angeles Housing Authority in May, will leave a massive agency of 15,000 
employees that provides housing to 600,000 poor tenants. The much smaller Los 
Angeles agency provides housing to 21,000 of the city's poorest residents. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the Housing Authority has "chosen the best person . . . in this 
country after an exhaustive nationwide search." 
</P>
<P>
Described by housing officials in both cities as a proponent of tenant 
management and the hiring of tenants as managers within the projects, Shuldiner 
said his first order of business will be a walk-through of the Los Angeles 
projects with tenant leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenants are not naive, and if they know you are out there trying, they give 
you more leeway than you perhaps deserve," he said at a news conference, where 
he and his family were joined by Bradley and housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney, Shuldiner has overseen daily operations of the New York agency 
since 1986. Previously, he ran a 1,200-person office that managed apartments 
which had been taken over by New York City after landlords failed to pay their 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
According to public housing experts, Shuldiner "only became available" because 
of the recent election in New York City of Mayor David N. Dinkins. In recent 
months, Dinkins passed over Shuldiner for a higher-ranking job and has been 
systematically replacing the top managers in city government, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is getting an outstanding opportunity because of those changes in New 
York," said Bob McKay, of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities in 
Washington. "He's a really premiere executive director in the country and one 
of the brightest, most competent persons in this business, who has been 
involved in a whole range of issues." 
</P>
<P>
Shuldiner, however, received mixed reviews from tenant leaders of New York 
City's vocal and politically active public housing committees. Some said 
Shuldiner was a disappointment to them because he was unable or unwilling to 
influence the city's public housing chairman and commissioners on behalf of 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Violet Hamilton, chairwoman of the Tenant Advisory Council, which is funded by 
New York's Housing Authority but elected by the tenants, said Shuldiner 
"probably did the best he could, but I did not get along with him." 
</P>
<P>
She complained that Shuldiner refused to pay for a breakfast proposed by tenant 
leaders to meet the candidates in the mayor's race, and she faulted him for not 
helping her group get its budget approved by the housing commission last year. 
</P>
<P>
James Fisher, a tenant leader at the Marlboro Houses development in 
Bensonhurst, said he had "great expectations when Shuldiner originally came in, 
but . . . I can't really give him praise. I feel that things under his 
administration kind of fell backwards." 
</P>
<P>
But Shuldiner also had his supporters among tenant activists. Ann Sanchez, 
chairwoman of the Council of Tenant Patrol Supervisors, which assists the 
police in controlling crime in the projects, said: "Oh my God, that's bad news 
that we are losing him. He is a great person, and when we meet with him he has 
been very good to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, also president of her tenant group at Gravesend project on Coney 
Island, said efforts to discourage crime "thrived under him better than before 
. . . I am surprised anyone has anything to say against him." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Shuldiner will oversee 8,500 public housing units that date 
from the 1950s and that require massive renovations. The previous two directors 
of the agency were both pressured from office amid charges of mismanagement, 
and the agency has been run by interim directors since early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The last director, Leila Gonzalez-Correa, was embroiled in a bitter, 
months-long feud with tenants. She left amid disclosures that she had awarded 
contracts to acquaintances without following bidding procedures and caused the 
city to lose $5 million in federal funds by proposing that the Jordan Downs 
project in Watts be sold to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly hoping to allay concerns over the agency's past troubles with tenants, 
Bradley, Shuldiner and Housing Commission Chairman Carl D. Covitz all 
emphasized the new housing chief's belief that tenants should control what 
happens to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Covitz said that Shuldiner's long-term assignments will include turning over 
some projects to tenant managers, with the ultimate goal of tenant ownership of 
apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission is completely committed to the idea that tenants should have a 
say in their destiny," Covitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Shuldiner pointed out that 21% of New York City's public housing residents are 
employed within the projects -- a stark contrast to Los Angeles, where only a 
handful of poor tenants have found work within the developments where they 
live. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about past Los Angeles directors who have not worked out, Shuldiner said 
he hoped to avoid such pitfalls by "dealing with people straight up."

MAN HIT BY TRUCK PLUNGES TO DEATH IN PIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A driverless truck careened down a steep hill in downtown Los Angeles Friday 
morning, hit a passing car, then struck a man as he waited for a light -- 
knocking him through a plywood fence to his death at the bottom of an 80-foot 
construction pit. 
</P>
<P>
Another pedestrian was injured in the bizarre accident about 10:30 a.m. at the 
intersection of Grand Avenue and 5th Street, across the street from the 
Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, who was not immediately identified, had parked it on 
the hill on Grand between 4th and 5th streets, locked it and had gone into a 
nearby building, said Lars Oakander, a Los Angeles police detective. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, the vehicle started to roll, picking up considerable speed, 
the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified passer-by ran alongside the Ford pickup trying to get inside, 
but the doors were locked, Oakander said. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to hold the truck back" with his hands, Oakander added. "But you know 
what it's like trying to hold onto a vehicle when it's moving." 
</P>
<P>
Only a stack of wood, he said, kept the pickup from plunging into the huge, 
concrete-lined pit, which is to be a four-story underground parking garage for 
the Los Angeles Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified a Francisco Molina Espinoza, 38, of La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered massive injuries and fractures as he fell into the pit and struck a 
series of steel supports, Oakander said. 
</P>
<P>
The second pedestrian, an unidentified man who also had been waiting for a 
light to change, was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, where he was treated and 
released. The driver of the car that was struck apparently was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Jonas Matz, a movie crew medical technician, was working inside the Biltmore 
when he heard that there had been an accident. He grabbed his medical bag and 
ran to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I climbed over the hood of the truck and suddenly there was this huge hole 
that I didn't expect," he said. "I looked down and there was a construction 
worker standing on a little platform about halfway down. I don't know if he 
jumped out of the way or what." 
</P>
<P>
The construction worker, who was not injured, pointed out the body at the 
bottom of the hole. Matz said Espinoza was unconscious when he reached him and 
died minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against the truck's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not know if he had put the truck's emergency brake on or if the 
truck was in park or neutral, Oakander said. 
</P>
<P>
Charges could be filed later if the truck owner is found to have acted 
negligently, Oakander said.

INVESTIGATORS FIND WELDS ON REFINERY PIPES FAULTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State investigators tested at least 25 welds on piping at the Shell Oil Co. 
refinery in Carson and found them all faulty in a unit that would have carried 
very hot and highly flammable petroleum liquids, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health discovered the bad 
welds during an investigation this week into work performed during a routine 
overhaul of the refinery's so-called coking unit by two contractors, Brown 
&amp; Root and Cooperheat Inc., said Kim Wiese of Local 1-128 of the Oil, 
Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union. 
</P>
<P>
Had Cal/OSHA not been called in, "those pipes were OKd to go into service and 
could have endangered employees," said Wiese, local representative of the 
union, which represents about 320 to 340 Shell workers. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA spokesman Richard Rice confirmed the investigation but declined to say 
what it had turned up. He would say only that Cal/OSHA was looking into 
allegations that Cooperheat failed to perform hardness tests to ensure the 
completeness of the welds made by Brown &amp; Root workers. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Cal/OSHA could expand its investigation into work done by the 
contractors at other Southern California refineries. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is there for major problems," said a source familiar with the 
investigation. "You're dealing with flammables and explosives." The source 
added that Cooperheat had been asked for records detailing work it had 
performed at other area refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the investigation comes at a time when critics are questioning the oil 
and chemical industry's safety record in the nation's refineries, and union 
officials have singled out the use of contract workers as a contributing 
factor. Industry and contractor officials have denied a safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Cooperheat, which is based in New Jersey and has an office in 
Long Beach, declined to comment on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, Shell spokeswoman Dee Dee Taylor said the company's routine 
auditing and testing procedures turned up "a problem with a contractor's 
weld-testing procedures." 
</P>
<P>
"However," she added, "we want to emphasize that the integrity of the welds was 
never in question." If there was a problem and "Cal/OSHA hadn't found it, we 
would have found it in our testing and we would not have started the unit," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Brown &amp; Root in Houston also denied there was a problem 
with the welds, saying X-rays of 10% of the welds showed them to be sound. 
</P>
<P>
Brown &amp; Root, one of the nation's largest engineering, construction and 
general management contractors, has done work in the Atlantic Richfield Co. 
refinery in Carson and the Texaco refinery in Wilmington, but the bulk of its 
work locally is done for Shell, said Joe M. Stevens, a Brown &amp; Root vice 
president in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperheat also has done work at the Arco refinery and at other area 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for Arco, said Brown &amp; Root had performed 
work on "just about every major construction project at the plant in recent 
years." He added that the company used Cooperheat for occasional work. He said 
the company was not aware of any problems with either contractor's work at the 
Arco refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shell's 125,000-barrel-per-day crude oil refinery employs about 600 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The welds in question were made on piping in the coker or coking unit, which 
heats heavy liquids left over after the initial distillation of crude oil to 
extract gas, gasoline and distillates and to leave behind coke, a nearly pure 
form of carbon. Temperatures within a coker can exceed 1,400 degrees, Wiese 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The piping was being installed during a routine "turnaround," or shutdown of 
operations to perform maintenance and repairs. None of the newly welded pipes 
had ever been placed in operation. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was prompted by a complaint Cal/OSHA received on March 19, 
Rice said. Brown &amp; Root's Stevens said the complaint came from a Cooperheat 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Cal/OSHA is investigating Cooperheat's work in "stress-relieving" 
the welds. That is work performed after welds are made. Cooperheat workers heat 
a pipe to very high temperatures and hold it there for a specified period of 
time, then gradually reduce the temperature to normal. The heating and cooling 
is designed to relieve stress on the welds and to reduce their brittleness, 
industry observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Wiese said Cooperheat certified the welds it stress-relieved. But, he said, 
Cal/OSHA subsequently came in and performed its own tests three times on each 
of 25 welds -- and found them all to be faulty. 
</P>
<P>
Although the investigation centers on Cooperheat's work, Rice added that if the 
welds were found to be bad, it would also call into question the quality of 
Brown &amp; Root's welding. "Any kind of pressure-bearing piping, if a weld 
were to fail and it were carrying a flammable liquid, there would be a 
potential for a fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens at Brown &amp; Root defended his company's work. "As far as we know, 
the welds are good. We tested the welds, and we have the X-rays to back them 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Although Shell officials would not comment on the current investigation, the 
refinery's health and safety manager defended the plant's safety record in an 
interview earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"In my experience, Shell has sufficient safeguards, auditing procedures and 
assurances in place to avoid a situation where we have people out there doing 
unsafe acts," said health and safety manager Aamir Farid. "We check them up 
front, we run spot checks and field checks, and we require immediate corrective 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Shell has had at least two accidents at the plant in the past two months. On 
March 15, a fire broke out in the plant's alkylation unit while employees were 
removing liquids from a large vessel. The vessel apparently ruptured during the 
process, and escaping vapors ignited. Fourteen people were given first aid 
treatment. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, Farid said. 
</P>
<P>
On March 17, a contract worker was electrocuted while working on an electrical 
substation in the plant. Cal/OSHA is investigating that accident as well.

MERCHANTS OF MENACE IN WAR ON DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
PARAPHERNALIA: HOUSEHOLD ITEMS THAT CAN BE USED IN SMOKING CRACK ARE STOCKED AT 
MANY STORES IN PARTS OF THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In some parts of Los Angeles, getting the paraphernalia needed to smoke crack 
cocaine is as easy as stopping at the corner store. The items are on the 
shelves at almost every liquor store and neighborhood market. Because most are 
common household products in everyday use, store managers seem unconcerned 
about running afoul of the law. But for drug users, these products take on an 
entirely different meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Glass tubes are easily fashioned into crack pipes. Copper mesh scrubbers used 
to scour pots are taken apart and made into tiny pipe screens. Cotton balls 
doused with 151-proof rum are a preferred method for "firing up." And there are 
tiny zip-lock bags for storing and selling the highly addictive form of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of the clothing gang members use to identify themselves. In 
some stores and at swap meets it is easy to find bandannas and athletic 
shoelaces in colors or brands favored by certain gangs, clothing with gang 
names sewed or stamped on and even magazines and catalogues targeted to gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
As crack use and gang activity mushroom in Los Angeles and across the country, 
so has the demand for these products, although few store owners seem to be 
getting rich on the sales. In neighborhoods hit hard by gangs and the crack 
epidemic, merchants are being criticized for profiting at the expense of their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like one big conspiracy of greed and everybody's a part of it," said Leon 
Watkins, who operates the South-Central Los Angeles-based Family Hot Line, a 
telephone service for families in crisis. "The worst part about it is it's all 
out in the open where kids can see it. Everybody knows the stores." 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants contend that they merely stock the products they know sell 
quickly. They insist they have no idea how the items are used once they leave 
the store. Police often are skeptical of these claims, yet seldom are able to 
act because the items have legitimate uses. 
</P>
<P>
But the way in which these products are displayed at certain stores and the 
volumes in which they are sold leave little doubt as to the intentions of many 
merchants and buyers. 
</P>
<P>
In an informal survey of more than a dozen liquor stores and markets in 
South-Central Los Angeles, a reporter found the pot scrubbers in every outlet, 
usually displayed conspicuously near the front entrance, away from other 
cleaning products. 
</P>
<P>
In other instances, they were stored behind the counter because -- as a clerk 
at one liquor store along Western Avenue put it -- "If we kept them on the 
shelves they (crack addicts) would steal them." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why his customers were purchasing the scrubbers, the owner of the 
Western Avenue store, who identified himself only as Mike, began vigorously 
scrubbing the counter. Almost as an afterthought, he lifted the scouring pad to 
his nose and took a long sniff. 
</P>
<P>
"Smoke, too," he said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
Other merchants seemed similarly resigned to the sale of products used by gangs 
and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't sell it, the guy down the street will," said one clerk at the L.A. 
Slauson Swap Meet on Slauson Avenue in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk, who identified himself only as Rick, was explaining why he was 
willing, upon request, to sew onto the back of a jacket the words "Playboy 
Gangster Crips," the name of a faction of one of Los Angeles' most notorious 
and deadly street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, a tiny shop that specializes in decorative lighting featured 
several cases filled with glass pipes that the owner insisted were intended for 
smoking tobacco and herbs. There also was a supply of small plastic bags 
ostensibly designed for storing jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't sell cars so people can get run over," said the shop owner, who 
spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. "But it happens. Does 
that mean you stop selling cars?" 
</P>
<P>
The problem extends beyond Los Angeles and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Father George Clements, a Catholic priest who gained national 
attention several years ago when he adopted a child, has mounted a highly 
visible campaign to rid neighborhood stores of glass pipes and other items that 
could be used to smoke crack. In Detroit, a newspaper writer was responsible 
for halting gas station sales of pipes, tiny weighing scales and the miniature 
zip-lock bags by printing in her column the names of the mostly suburbanite 
station owners. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, protests against drug paraphernalia sales have been less 
visible. Police say they receive few complaints from citizens about stores that 
sell these products, said Detective Dennis Zeuner of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Zeuner, who coordinates the department's efforts to crack down on drug 
paraphernalia, said officers are aware of the problem but focus their 
enforcement efforts on stores that sell large numbers of items that can more 
easily be categorized as drug-related. Most of these are stores that in the 
1960s would have been called "head shops." 
</P>
<P>
Under California's 7-year-old drug-paraphernalia law, Zeuner said, it would be 
all but impossible to prosecute owners of, say, a liquor store that stocks 
common household items that also are used to smoke crack. He cited the copper 
mesh pot scrubbers as an example of the difficulties in pressing a case. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there have got to be some people who buy those things to clean pots," 
Zeuner said, adding that some merchants may not know that the scouring pads 
also are used to smoke crack. On the other hand, he added, some stores sell the 
mesh already cut into pieces and packaged in little plastic bags for as much as 
75 cents, about the price of a whole scourer. 
</P>
<P>
Under most conditions, Zeuner said, merchants could be prosecuted only if they 
advertise the scourers as crack paraphernalia and indicate they are selling 
them solely for use with the drug, by selling pipes along with them, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true with other products such as disposable lighters or the cotton 
balls and rum that some addicts use to make homemade torches. None of these 
products, in and of themselves, can be classified as drug paraphernalia, even 
though spent disposable lighters and burned-out homemade torches typically 
litter areas where crack users congregate. 
</P>
<P>
To discourage stores from selling items such as glass pipes and the small 
plastic zip-lock bags, officers will sometimes visit store owners or managers, 
show them a copy of the state law and ask them to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
"In 99 cases out of a hundred," Zeuner said, "the stuff disappears because it's 
not a large part of the guy's inventory." 
</P>
<P>
Zeuner does not believe that any liquor store or market owner is getting rich 
from selling scourers or lighters to crack users. Pipes, however, depending 
upon the volume of a store's sales, can be very profitable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The smallest can be purchased for 50 cents and sold for up to $8, Zeuner said. 
Some large, ornately shaped or decorated pipes go for considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
Some anti-drug activists contend that the manufacturers of the products popular 
among crack users are making big profits from the crack epidemic. But there are 
no sales figures to support their claims. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Dedera, a spokeswoman for the Phoenix-based Dial Corp., manufacturer of 
Brillo brand copper mesh pot scourers, which are found in stores in the Los 
Angeles area, said sales did not increase as drug use surged. She insisted that 
Dial's share of the pot-scourer market is tiny and referred a reporter to a 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the New Jersey-based Airwick Industries, maker of the Chore 
Boy, the brand Dedera contended is the largest seller on the market, did not 
return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Profits made by manufacturers of gang wear or stores that stock the clothing 
are similarly difficult to determine. 
</P>
<P>
Some stores surveyed by The Times stocked only a single product -- bandannas, 
typically -- and displayed just a few of the items. 
</P>
<P>
Customers include hardened gang members and those who simply want to emulate 
their style. Swap-meet vendors who sew gang names on caps and other apparel 
said this represents only a small percentage of their business. Other store 
owners said it was never their intention to serve gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conway, the owner of No Sweat, an athletic-wear shop on Manchester 
Avenue, said that several months after he opened his business he was stunned to 
discover some of his customers were gang members who adopted the logos of 
professional and college sports teams as their own. Particular products are 
chosen by gangs because a team name corresponds to the initials of their gang 
faction, the color of the item corresponds with a favorite color of the gang, 
or because the team's name sounds menacing. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang members don't come in here throwing high signs, but they occasionally 
come in," Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
Conway said he has since learned much about what gang members want. One 
South-Central gang that calls itself the Kitchen Crips wears clothing stamped 
with KC for the Kansas City Chiefs, he said. Another Crips set that operates on 
nearby Main Street likes the initials of Michigan State University because they 
can also stand for Main Street University, a name the set has adopted for 
itself, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and school officials say the logos of teams such as the Los Angeles 
Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers are popular with Los Angeles gangs. A Crips 
faction that claims as its turf portions of Grape Street in Watts has adopted 
Los Angeles Lakers apparel because much of it comes in purple, one of the 
team's colors. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gang workers sympathize with merchants like Conway, who clearly are not 
going out of their way to cater to gangs. But they are less tolerant of 
merchants who, they are convinced, know what buyers intend to do with their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Guzman, a Community Youth Gang Services worker who speaks to schools and 
parent groups about gang paraphernalia, said he has found in the racks of 
convenience stores magazines that are unmistakably targeted to Latino gang 
members. The letters and articles in one appear to be written in a code common 
to some gang graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman also has in his collection a catalogue from a store in Reseda that 
advertises apparel adopted by gangs, including colored bandannas and 
intricately woven cords that are worn on the hands and wrists of "cholas," or 
girl gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Other activists point to liquor store owners who stock blue bandannas in Crips 
neighborhoods, knowing that blue is the gang's color, or red in a Bloods 
neighborhood, knowing that Bloods favor red. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, volunteers in the Brotherhood Crusade's anti-gang, anti-drug "Taking 
Our Community Back" campaign surveyed stores in a targeted area in 
South-Central and asked store owners to remove blue bandannas wherever they 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
At one store, the owner refused to honor the request. The activists entered en 
masse, demanded the bandannas be turned over, then burned them in the store's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Although schools have attempted to discourage gang-style clothing, prosecutors 
say merchants who sell bandannas to rival Crips or Bloods, even knowingly, have 
broken no laws. As is true for much of the drug paraphernalia, certain kinds of 
apparel cannot be banned, they say, because many of the logos adopted by gangs 
are the legitimate logos not only of sports teams but of clothing designers and 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Calvin Klein apparel that carries the initials CK is favored by 
Bloods who say the initials actually stand for Crip Killers. Athletic shoes and 
other apparel bearing the initials of the manufacturer British Knight are 
favored by Crips, who say the letters stand for Blood Killers. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, some activists say, is that there are shootings almost every day 
in Los Angeles in which the victims are targeted chiefly because they happen to 
be wearing the wrong color or brand of clothing. In some cases merchants, they 
insist, have a duty to warn law-abiding customers of the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
V.G. Guinses, executive director of Save Every Youngster Youth Enterprise 
Society, a 20-year-old anti-gang, anti-drug program in South-Central, cited the 
case of a well-regarded high school student who was gunned down in a drive-by 
shooting in Southwest Los Angeles about two years ago simply because he was 
wearing blue shoelaces in an area claimed by Bloods sets. 
</P>
<P>
"A person has a right to buy what he wants," Guinses said, "but he should at 
least be told that it could get him killed." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the killings and the notoriety of Los Angeles' street gangs, there are 
some merchants in crime-ridden neighborhoods who insist they know nothing about 
the problems that surround them. 
</P>
<P>
At the J.C. Mini Mall/Broadway Swap Meet on South Broadway in South-Central, a 
woman who refused to give her name agreed, without hesitation, to sew the word 
"Crips" on a baseball hat at the request of a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, she said she had no idea what the name stands for, even though it 
was scrawled in large letters among other graffiti on the front of the building 
where she works. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs?" she asked. "(Are) gangs bad?"

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE CLEARS WAY FOR COMPOST HEAP'S REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who calls himself Zeke the Sheik stood Friday in Pasadena Superior 
Court with a 3-foot-tall green onion in his hand and pleaded for time to save 
the colossal compost heap that he began in 1973. But Judge Harold E. Shabo 
issued a temporary restraining order clearing the way for Mountain View 
Cemetery to dispose of the 30-foot heap, which sits on a vacant parcel of its 
land adjacent to Zeke's home in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my creation, my work of art . . . and they're going to wipe me out," 
Zeke, the alter ego of 47-year-old Timothy Dundon, said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cemetery years ago gave Dundon permission to pile the steamy mass 
on its property, the county Department of Health Services says the hill is an 
illegal dump and that work to remove it must begin by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dundon vowed to have himself nailed to a giant cross atop the mound when the 
bulldozers come.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT SEIZED IN 1979 MURDER OF GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man wanted for the suspected murder of his girlfriend in Vermont more than a 
decade ago has been arrested at a Woodland Hills motel. 
</P>
<P>
Francis W. Malinosky, 44, disappeared from Burlington, Vt., in 1979 while he 
was a suspect in the disappearance of Judith Leo-Coneys, a 32-year-old 
schoolteacher with whom he had recently ended a two-year relationship. 
</P>
<P>
She has never been found and is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Malinosky, 44, who had been a teacher and school administrator 
in the Burlington area, apparently had been living for at least two years in 
Los Angeles under the name Michael Bryant, working as a free-lance photographer 
and house painter. He was being held Friday at the Parker Center jail awaiting 
extradition to Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
A Vermont prosecutor said Malinosky was traced through a credit card to mail 
drops in Hollywood and Woodland Hills.

COURT URGED TO OVERTURN LIBEL AWARD TO SINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An NBC attorney attempted Friday to persuade federal appeals court judges in 
Pasadena to strike down the largest libel verdict against an American news 
organization -- a $5.3-million judgment that the network defamed singer Wayne 
Newton in newscasts that linked him to organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
NBC lawyer Floyd Abrams said the stories were the product of aggressive 
reporting, not ill will, and should be protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
But Newton's lawyer, Morton R. Galane, urged the judges to uphold the December, 
1986, verdict of a Las Vegas federal court jury that Newton had been injured 
unfairly by three broadcasts in 1980 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Newton, 47, who listened to the legal arguments with his daughter and friends, 
said that regardless of who wins he has been injured forever. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone accuses you of what I've been accused of by these people . . . 
the effects of what they said will last the rest of my life," the singer said 
outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said after the hearing that the case is very important because "a loss . 
. . would make it very difficult for the news media to report about 
investigations and suspicions about public figures, particularly in their own 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Galane agreed that the case has broad ramifications. In his brief, he asserted 
that there would be negative consequences for many people besides Newton if the 
punitive damages, which constitute $5 million of the $5.3-million verdict, are 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"If such awards are prohibited, victims of malicious defamation by the mass 
media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred from 
disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods," Galane wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle stems out of three newscasts by NBC's special investigative 
unit, headed by reporter Brian Ross and producer Ira Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
The first report, on the Oct. 6, 1980, Nightly News, focused on Newton's 
relationship with Guido Penosi, who was described as "a New York hoodlum from 
the Gambino Mafia family." 
</P>
<P>
The story said that Penosi was a key figure in an ongoing federal grand jury 
investigation of the activities of the Gambino family in Las Vegas and that 
investigators were looking into Newton's purchase of the Aladdin hotel-casino 
there. The broadcast said Frank Piccolo, a Gambino family boss in New York, had 
become a hidden partner in the Aladdin as a result of helping Newton take care 
of a problem of an undisclosed nature. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the newscast showed Newton testifying before the Nevada Gaming 
Board on the subject of his relationship with Penosi. Federal authorities said 
Newton had not told them the whole story about the relationship, the broadcast 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Newton's lawyers demanded a retraction four days later, calling the report 
"untrue and slanderous." NBC stood by the story. 
</P>
<P>
The network ran two follow-up stories, one on Nov. 6, 1980, after Newton 
testified before a Connecticut grand jury investigating Piccolo, and another on 
June 12, 1981, the day Piccolo and Penosi were indicted by a federal grand jury 
in Connecticut on extortion charges. Piccolo was shot to death in a Bridgeport, 
Conn., telephone booth before the extortion trial and Penosi was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Newton sued for libel in 1981 and after numerous delays a 37-day trial was held 
in 1986. The jury awarded him $19.3 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
On a verdict form, the jury said that there had been one false statement in the 
stories and one false impression conveyed. But the jurors did not say what they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven months later, U.S. District Judge M.D. Crocker, who presided at the 
trial, reduced the award to $5.3 million. In January, 1989, Newton agreed to 
accept the reduced award rather than have a new trial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One issue emphasized by Abrams in the appeal is whether a broadcaster can be 
held liable in a defamation case based upon a "false impression" created by 
true statements in its broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams acknowledged that "there was no way this broadcast could have been made 
at all without leaving a negative impression" of Newton. But NBC did not 
deliberately set out to injure Newton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Galane said Abrams had misstated the issue because the jury found that 
there was a false statement in the report, not merely that a false impression 
was conveyed. Moreover, his brief contends in detail that NBC was out to get 
Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals court Judge William Norris questioned both Abrams and Galane 
intensively about the extent of an appeals court's power to review jury 
findings in First Amendment cases involving public figures. Galane asserted 
that the review should be limited to the question of whether the jury had 
abused its discretion, while Abrams argued for a much broader review. 
</P>
<P>
Norris also asked the lawyers to compare the NBC stories to articles done by 
Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate 
scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
"We tread a very fine line here to make sure that future Woodwards and 
Bernsteins aren't inhibited in pursuing their stories," Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
Another key issue in the appeal is whether Judge Crocker erred by refusing to 
grant NBC's motion to move the trial from Las Vegas, where Newton has been a 
longtime headliner in showrooms and will start a four-week appearance at the 
Las Vegas Hilton next week. A street has been named after him there and he has 
received many civic honors. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said putting NBC on trial in Las Vegas "was the American equivalent of 
trying author Salman Rushdie in Tehran for defaming the Ayatollah." 
</P>
<P>
A pretrial poll taken for NBC showed that 95.6% of the people in the area knew 
who Newton was and that 70% had a favorable impression of him. But Judge 
Crocker said the poll revealed nothing about whether they would be biased. 
</P>
<P>
Federal appeals court Judges Alfred T. Goodwin and Dorothy Nelson also took 
part in the hearing. A decision is not expected for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Newton sold his interest in the Aladdin some time ago.

TOP LAPD OFFICIALS AGREE TO SUBMIT TO RANDOM DRUG TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department will begin mandatory random drug testing of 
all 93 of its captains, commanders and deputy chiefs on May 1, Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates and the Command Officers Assn. announced Friday. The testing 
program is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the $250,000 program outlined at a news conference at Parker Center, 
command officers will be selected randomly by a police computer and undergo 
urine tests for several illicit narcotics -- including cocaine, marijuana and 
PCP. Gates said he, too, will be tested. 
</P>
<P>
Those who test positive for illegal drugs face being fired, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is that they have no place in the Police Department," the chief 
said. "We would do our very best to fire them." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department began similar testing of cadets in August, 1988. Since 
then, Gates said, only two cadets have been dropped from the force for testing 
positive for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The department fires about 10 police officers a year for drug abuse, said Cmdr. 
William Booth. The department has roughly 8,000 officers and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Command Officers Assn. maintained that none of their members 
use drugs, but they have consented to be tested without advance notice to set 
examples for both rank-and-file officers and the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to demonstrate to the community that they have the right to feel some 
confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department," said Cmdr. Larry Kramer, one 
of the directors of the Command Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said he hopes the drug-testing program will encourage the Los Angeles 
Police Protective League, the police officers' union, to support his plan to 
begin random testing of all of the department's officers by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to block his plan, the 7,800-member union filed a complaint with 
the city Employee Relations Board in February charging the chief with unfair 
labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying hard to discuss this with the union," Gates said. "Somehow, we 
have not been able to reach an agreement. . . . I'm hopeful this example shown 
by the leadership here will start the ball rolling." 
</P>
<P>
A union spokesman said the Police Protective League does not oppose drug 
testing, but fears Gates is trying to use the issue to reopen contract 
negotiations prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what he's trying to do," said George Aliano, the president of 
the union. "Drug testing is not the issue. The contract is the issue. But I can 
tell you that, confidentially, less than 80% of the officers support mandatory 
random drug testing." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the latest program will test every command officer at least once a 
year, but there will be no limit on the number of times an officer can be 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
During the test, Gates said, two urine samples will be taken. The police lab 
will examine one sample for traces of illegal drugs. If that sample tests 
positive, the second sample will be taken to an independent lab and tested. 
</P>
<P>
If the two test results conflict, a third analysis at a private lab will be 
conducted to resolve the discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any program like this in the country," the chief said, 
referring to the testing of top brass. "I have heard that other places are 
contemplating this, but we're the only police department that I know of to 
actually do it." 
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Gates also addressed reports that scores of 
misdemeanor drug cases were not prosecuted by the city attorney's office in 
1988 because an LAPD policy permitted officers to bypass preliminary testing of 
suspected narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, officers were told they could skip the preliminary test 
because the police crime lab would fully analyze seized substances. But the lab 
results did not come back in time for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Because there were no available tests to show that many of the confiscated 
substances were illicit drugs, many drug arrests were never prosecuted, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely unhappy over this whole issue," said Gates, who last September 
rescinded the order permitting preliminary tests to be bypassed. "The fault is 
both on our side and the city attorney's side. We retested those cases, took 
them back to the city attorney's office and were assured that they would be 
filed. They have not been." 
</P>
<P>
But officials at the city attorney's office said about 50 cases were affected 
by the order, and that all eventually were filed. 
</P>
<P>
"(Gates) is 100% wrong," said Alice Hand, the supervisor of the filing and 
arraignment branch of the city prosecutor's office. "As far as I know, they 
have all been filed. . . . Gates . . . has bad information."

RICK DU BROW: DEATH, TAXES AND 'THE TONIGHT SHOW'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: PAT SAJAK IS THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE OF CHALLENGERS TO LOSE THE 
LATE-NIGHT BATTLE AGAINST A PHENOMENON THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

One by one, they fire, fall back and eventually are blown away. Dick Cavett, 
Merv Griffin, Joey Bishop, Joan Rivers, Alan Thicke and now, this week, Pat 
Sajak. All have tried to unseat Johnny Carson, but no one has yet found the 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is none. And that is why it was no surprise when CBS canceled 
"The Pat Sajak Show" only 15 months after it debuted with great fanfare. Sajak 
tried to challenge Carson on the late-night king's own terrain -- emulating the 
format that he has perfected in an incredible 27 1/2 years of hosting NBC's 
"Tonight" show. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sajak series ran into another impregnable force -- "The Tonight Show" 
itself. And "Tonight" is a practically perfect television structure, a star in 
its own right, which has been an accommodating home to its three principal 
hosts over the years: Steve Allen from 1954-57, Jack Paar from 1957-62 and 
Carson from 1962 until now. 
</P>
<P>
Elegantly simple, with comfortable and familiar rituals -- Carson's monologue, 
his chat with Ed McMahon -- "Tonight" is an ideal creature of habit for its 
viewers, who clearly still enjoy having the comedian turn out the lights after 
all these years. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that the only major talk show competitor who has made a real 
run at Carson -- Arsenio Hall -- has been smart enough to play on his own field 
and not fall into the trap of unwinnable comparisons. While their formats bear 
some similarities, their tones are distinctly different in keeping with the 
styles of the two personalities: Carson the smooth and Hall the smoothie. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's strategy is smarter than even he or his staff may realize, for the 
competition is also "The Tonight Show" itself, and not only Carson. Stylish to 
a fault in its show business know-how, "Tonight" is a television arena that 
somehow makes everyone who appears on it look a little better, a little 
classier than they appear almost anywhere else. Performers know it. They know 
they're playing the Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Rivers, whose often-raunchy humor somehow played 
beautifully when muted slightly by the aura of "The Tonight Show." When she 
took her act to Fox TV for her own late-night series, the atmosphere was simply 
more common, and raunchy was just raunchy. Bishop was also better with Carson 
than on his own show. And so, for that matter, was Sajak -- in no small degree 
because Carson is a masterful straight man as well as gagster, which 
contributes to the overall tone of civility. 
</P>
<P>
This tone -- this blend of show and performer -- is what has given Carson a 
setting of credibility for the social and political comments of his monologue. 
There may be off days, Carson may have his blue jokes, but "Tonight" is almost 
never, ever, tacky. For that reason, it gets respect and attention from the 
political establishment. 
</P>
<P>
During election campaigns and at times of national crisis, Carson's jokes are 
among the most influential political commentary in the land. When, during 
Chrysler's bad days, Carson cracked that Sen. Robert Dole was "a Chrysler on 
the parking lot of life," it did the politician no good. Carson's unrelenting 
jibes at Ronald and Nancy Reagan when they were in the White House were 
representative of the level of commentary that no other comedian could pull off 
with equal stature. 
</P>
<P>
Carson sub Jay Leno, for instance, is superb at instant political and social 
commentary, and he has been growing wonderfully against the backdrop of 
"Tonight." But probably the only TV comedian to come close to Carson in terms 
of national impact -- though in a wholly different manner -- is David 
Letterman, because his attitude came to speak for an entire generation during 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing Carson's special status as a sort of barometer of public opinion, Sajak 
indicated before his debut in January of 1989 that he did not intend, at least 
for a while, to attempt to match the comedian as a national voice. But in 
hardly any time at all, he seemed to be doing just that -- not that he didn't 
have the right, but he certainly didn't have the credibility, coming as he did 
from the game show "Wheel of Fortune," in which he starred, and continues to 
star, with Vanna White. 
</P>
<P>
CBS put a lot of money on Sajak, and he seemed a pretty good bet at the time. 
Like Carson, who had also been a TV game show host -- on "Who Do You Trust?" -- 
Sajak had shown promise on "Wheel of Fortune." And because of that enormously 
successful syndicated series, he had perhaps more national popularity than any 
other contender who had ever challenged Carson for the late-night crown. He was 
certainly better-known than Hall, who debuted with his syndicated show only a 
week before Sajak launched his CBS entry. 
</P>
<P>
But after a quick ratings start, and the pleasant surprise to see that Sajak 
could deliver a monologue with confidence and aplomb, the tune-in for the show 
began to slip and slip. Cutting the program from its original 90-minute length 
to an hour last October didn't help, nor did the elimination of a sidekick and 
the desk-and-couch format, which gave way to a round-table setting. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was more than changing the furniture around. "The Pat Sajak Show" 
simply didn't offer anything unique. It was just more of the same, and not as 
stylishly done as "Tonight." The question was why anyone would tune out Carson 
for the clone-like Sajak show if there was a choice between the two. Viewers 
clearly felt that way. Carson creamed Sajak in the ratings. And so, for that 
matter, did Hall. 
</P>
<P>
CBS erred from the start. Its notion was that if Sajak could just hang in there 
until Carson retired, he would be the heir as the logical and established 
late-night leader. In short, the next Carson. The flaw in this thinking was 
monumental. Carson is Carson. Who says the world is waiting for a twin? Steve 
Allen, Jack Paar and Carson have been totally different and totally successful 
hosts of "Tonight." Letterman and Leno and Hall are all different from each 
other -- and from Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do something different and CBS didn't," says a late-night 
executive. (CBS, while deciding on the future, will turn principally to 
"Wiseguy" reruns starting Monday to fill the slot of the Sajak series, which 
ended Friday night). In Nashville this week, Sajak's TV sidekick, Dan Miller, 
who eventually was removed from the job and turned into an announcer, was 
quoted as saying "We tried to play it safe" and that the show "never found its 
own identity." And that's certainly the way it looked on screen. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Carson's identity as the reigning power of late-night TV survived another 
threat, and rather more easily than might have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a sudden urge to call it a day -- or a night -- Carson has indicated 
often that he will continue on the NBC series, but only as long as he is No. 1. 
And you can bet on that. He works hard to stay in shape, looks good and seems 
to be enjoying "Tonight" as much as ever. If his upcoming annual decision on 
whether to return another year is anything but positive, it would stun many of 
those involved with him. 
</P>
<P>
But however long Carson continues on "Tonight," the series itself will still be 
there to daunt the competition -- a triumph of taste and eternal showmanship in 
an increasingly sleazy, juvenile entertainment arena. It is one of TV's rare 
and regal series, with a genuine lineage -- and all the hosts are still with 
us: Carson, the cool, controlled humorist and incomparable sketch performer; 
Allen, the brilliant ringmaster and wit; and Paar, the emotional comic whose 
unpredictability gave his "Tonight" shows the thrillingly dangerous sense of a 
runaway train with an uncertain end. 
</P>
<P>
Carson is arguably the most successful star in TV history. Good times and bad, 
"Tonight" always delivered the goods -- and the profits -- for NBC. With 
Letterman and Leno as heirs apparent, the show's future is assured. And past 
and present are remarkably linked: Letterman, whose show is produced by Carson, 
also grew up an admirer of Allen -- which is obvious from his program -- and 
his director, Hal Gurnee, was also Paar's director. 
</P>
<P>
Call it breeding. "Tonight" is a history of TV.

SNOQUALMIE: IT'S NO 'TWIN PEAKS'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE WASHINGTON TOWN THAT SERVED AS THE SETTING FOR THE NIGHTTIME 
SOAP LIKES THE SHOW BUT NOT ALL THE ATTENTION.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Reed claims that most of this city's bowlers checked out early this week 
from his Mt. Si bowling lanes to watch ABC's "Twin Peaks" when it made its 
debut Sunday night, followed by the series start Thursday. The new murder 
mystery series, created by "Blue Velvet" director David Lynch, was filmed in 
part in Snoqualmie, a logging town 25 miles east of Seattle hard by Snoqualmie 
Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Most people wanted to compare notes, to see how the location work matched with 
the final television version, how many familiar sights they could spot. But a 
"Twin Peaks" mystery of another sort is bedeviling the residents: are some of 
this town's 1,500 residents engaged in bloody satanic rituals, plunging to 
untimely deaths from the top of 246-foot Snoqualmie Falls, or facing off in the 
backwoods to solve lovers' quarrels with dueling chain saws? That's the 
impression some residents claim has been produced. Not by the television series 
but by a reporter for the tabloid weekly the Star. 
</P>
<P>
When Lynch selected this mountain retreat and its smaller twin city North Bend 
as his fictional Twin Peaks, Snoqualmie residents welcomed the attention. But 
then the Star claimed to find a dark side to Snoqualmie, darker even than the 
television portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
According to the April 10 issue of the Star: "Real Twin Peaks Town Hides Dark 
Secrets of Its Own." At first, residents were outraged or amused over 
Snoqualmie's image as the fun-with-chain-saws capital. Even Police Chief Dan 
Isely claimed that the Star article became "kind of a joke with a lot of the 
people in the town." 
</P>
<P>
Star reporter Dave Lafontaine wrote that Snoqualmie's majestic woods hide 
hooded satanic cults who draw pentagons with human blood and leaving mutilated 
cats, goats and chickens hanging from the trees. "Scores" of suicides have 
jumped into thundering Snoqualmie Falls. Residents still whisper about a former 
Snoqualmie citizen: serial sex murderer Ted Bundy, executed last year in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Also common in Snoqualmie, according to the Star, are knife fights over women 
between drunken loggers, often ending in shootings and "chain-saw duels." 
</P>
<P>
All this somehow seems weirdly appropriate for the filming location of "Twin 
Peaks," whose story revolves around the murder of a high school homecoming 
queen. 
</P>
<P>
According to Isely, the peaceful people of this logging town are no more likely 
to duel with chain saws than they are to ship the body of the homecoming queen 
down the falls in a plastic bag. "It's (the Star's portrayal) so blown out of 
proportion that if anybody believes that of a town of 1,500 people in the 
Northwest -- well, I'm concerned about that person," Isely said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Olah, marketing director for Snoqualmie's Railway Museum, said of the Star 
and the television series: "both are based on fiction, and both are amusing," 
adding that the only rumor he's heard about viciousness of loggers concerns one 
logger who can "eat a hot dog and drink a beer through his nose at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Some in Snoqualmie fail to see the humor in the town's portrayals. "Nobody is 
happy about the Star article," said Mayor Jeanne Hansen. Businessman George 
Swenson, 64, who was born in Snoqualmie, said that while he found the Star 
article funny, it spoiled the town's enjoyment of "Twin Peaks." "They'd like to 
tangle up the town in the series' story line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But most everybody here seems more ready to laugh than cry about the town's 
notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
Kwok Louie, owner of North Bend's Hangchow restaurant, has a picture of two 
chain saws hanging on the wall of his bar like some absurd family coat-of-arms. 
A sign outside Big Edd's Dine In/Drive Thru Tavern warns: "Please Check Your 
Chainsaw Before Entering." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the television series is concerned, many of the town residents so far 
have found it slow and hard to follow. Most said they watched to see what 
buildings, places and people they could recognize. 
</P>
<P>
Dog trainer Bill Williams, having his hair cut at Ed's Barber Shop by Doug 
Bergquist, was unenthusiastic. "They didn't have no dogs in there," he 
complained. "And where'd they get those actors? Geez, it was worse than a high 
school play!" Then he drove off in a truck bearing the license plate "DAWG." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Coast to Coast Total Hardware found co-owner Betty Carmichael deep 
in discussion about "Twin Peaks" with her employees. "It wasn't the crime, it 
was the Peyton Place image that I didn't like," Carmichael said. "I know it's 
silly, but this is your home, and it isn't anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
City Hall account clerk Peggy Skinner called "Twin Peaks" hokey, but admitted 
she watched Thursday's episode "to see if they are going to solve anything, at 
least one more night." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner does not believe the sinister goings-on in the movie will lead tourists 
to avoid the town. "It's so much the opposite -- about the worst crime here is 
that a few garbage cans get knocked over," she said. "But it may attract 
visitors to this bad, bad town." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Snoqualmie residents were celebrating because a decision to 
make nearby Snoqualmie Ridge part of the city of Snoqualmie had been accepted, 
allowing for the development of 2,000 new homes and a professional golf course. 
Clearly, growth in the area has not been stopped by chain saws. The development 
was approved Thursday night by town officials who obviously had heavier duty to 
perform than to watch the high-rated show. 
</P>
<P>
Still, those who oppose growth in the area remain hopeful that things will 
remain the same. "There are some who say, 'Well, maybe all these stories will 
stop all those Californians from moving up here," Isely said.

'PEAKS' MAKES STRONG MOVE TO REGULAR TIME SLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Twin Peaks," which arrived with whopping ratings for its two-hour premiere 
Sunday, continued its strong showing in its regular time-period debut Thursday 
against "Cheers" and "Grand," part of NBC's top prime-time lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The new ABC series averaged 27% of the national audience for its hour. Although 
defeated by "Cheers," which drew 33% of viewers, "Twin Peaks" was a solid 
second with 26% for that half-hour. "Twin Peaks" then won its second half-hour 
with 27% of the audience, while "Grand" had 25%.

DAYHIKE: A RAINBOW OF HISTORY IN EAST MOJAVE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The designation on the map of "National Natural Landmark" is a tip-off, but 
nothing can prepare hikers for the colorful hills that make up Rainbow Basin. 
Pink, white, orange, brown, red, black and green sediments form the basin's 
rainbow-colored walls. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Basin is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the agency 
in charge of the 1.5 million-acre East Mojave National Scenic Area. Rainbow 
Basin's location just north of Interstate 15 in Barstow puts it just out of the 
scenic area (which will become a national park if Sen. Alan Cranston succeeds 
with his California Desert Conservation bill). 
</P>
<P>
Though geographically gerrymandered out of the scenic area, Rainbow Basin is, 
to say the least, colorfully scenic. This place in the Calico Mountains is 
ideal for the hiker to sample the mountains, the geology and the rich historic 
record of the East Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The topography of the Mojave, termed "basin and range," is characterized by 
south-trending mountain ranges rising abruptly from the desert floor, separated 
by irregularly spaced basins. (Basins, unlike valleys, are not drained by 
rivers.) The mountains have been formed by the movement of land along 
earthquake faults that run through here. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 million years ago, grasslands filled Rainbow Basin, then populated by 
saber-toothed tigers, mastodons, camels, three-toed horses and even 
rhinoceroses. Their fossil remains are encased in sedimentary rock that once 
formed a lake bed. As a result of intense geologic activity over the millennia, 
what was once at the bottom of the lake is now a series of folded, faulted, 
colorful hills. 
</P>
<P>
Owl Canyon, one of three moderate hikes in Rainbow Basin, takes its name from 
the barn owls who live there. Hikers should be reasonably agile in order to 
tackle Owl Canyon Trail, because getting through the canyon means scrambling 
over some boulders. 
</P>
<P>
You could spend a pleasant weekend camping and hiking in Rainbow Basin. 
Stationed at Owl Canyon Campground is a campground host, who can provide hiking 
and touring tips. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trail head: Follow Interstate 15 to Barstow, then join Highway 58 
to Ft. Irwin Road, following it 5 miles. Turn west on dirt Fossil Road and 
proceed 3 miles to Owl Canyon Campground. The trail begins at the north end of 
the campground. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: Follow the marked trail into Owl Canyon. Half a mile up-canyon look 
for a small cave on your right. Sandstone and silt stone, shale and volcanic 
debris are among the exposed rock. The geologic formations en route are not 
only rainbow-colored but dramatic in shape. Particularly evident are massive 
down-folds geologists call synclines. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon narrows for a time then opens up at its end into a multicolored 
amphitheater. Velvet Peak is the high spot above the rocky bowl. Experienced 
hikers can scramble up the bowl's rocky ridges for fine views of Rainbow Basin 
and the vast East Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
Return the same way. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Rainbow basin or nearby East Mojave National Scenic 
Area, visit the California Desert Information Center, 831 Barstow Road, 
Barstow, or call (619) 256-8617.

DISCOVERY: TUSTIN GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A man in an oil-decorated blue uniform stands just outside the red and white, 
wood-frame building and gazes retrospectively down the street. "You know, this 
used to be the last stop for service and gas between Los Angeles and San 
Diego," says Mark A. Sequeira, owner of the historic Tustin Garage. 
</P>
<P>
Not much has changed since the business opened nearly a century ago. It still 
looks and feels like a garage. Fan belts and gaskets hang from the rafters. 
Cartons of motor oil are stacked five deep to one side, and dismembered 
engines, clutches and carburetors await their turn on the operating tables. 
</P>
<P>
And it smells like a garage. A rich, hearty fragrance of grease and metal and 
sunlight and dust has seeped into every crack and pore of the landmark site. It 
is a scent intrinsic to the business and it instills an unquestioned trust and 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
One can almost hear partners William Huntley and Nicholas Gulick in the old 
days tell a customer whose shiny red, 1926 Model T has just rolled in 
sputtering, "No problem. Just needs a tuneup. That'll be $1.75." And the 
customer whose gleaming black, 1990 Cougar has lost its purr to an ill-sounding 
hiss is likewise reassured when Sequeira tells them, "Probably just needs a 
tuneup. Should be no more than $50." 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin Garage has had a steady line of cars in and out of its doors since 
Huntley and Gulick took over the floundering business in 1915, after a couple 
of false starts by less-enterprising owners. Most likely it was Gulick who 
handled most of the chores -- Huntley was busy as a member of Tustin's first 
City Council, and its second mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The garage continued to prosper even after the pair sold it in 1940 to Patricia 
Bryce. It was sold again in 1946 to Virginia Stevens, who was responsible for 
removing the gas pumps that had served motorists on the El Camino Real for 
decades. After another shift in ownership, the business changed hands most 
recently in 1984, when Sequeira happened to be in the right place at the right 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved out here from Boston with my wife and daughter because I had a job all 
lined up in transportation," Sequeira says. "But when I got here, it had fallen 
through. I just happened on this place. The owners were about ready to retire, 
clients had started to fall off, so I made a deal to buy this place right then 
and there and go into business for myself." 
</P>
<P>
With a lot of hard work, a complete automotive-repair service, reasonable 
prices and a good business head, Sequeira turned things around quickly and has 
been in the black since his first year; he now has a staff of five full-time 
mechanics including himself, and one full-time office manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Our specialty is the bigger jobs like body work, clutches, electrical work, 
and engine and transmission overhauls" Sequeira says. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a 1927 journal entry preserved in the Tustin Area Museum that 
reads "regrind and overhaul motor and transmission . . . $25," that service 
today would be around $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, as much as things change, they remain the same. And at 
the rate Sequeira is going, the Tustin Garage will still be doing a booming 
business long after Capt. Kirk has dropped off the Enterprise for a quick lube 
and force-field rotation.

Lebensraum is not a word you will hear above a whisper in Europe these days, 
but the local equivalent is alive and well, with cities always looking for ways 
to expand their borders. After all, a third of the county is still 
unincorporated. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Orange County's cities have increased in size since they became cities; 
only Villa Park and relative newcomers Dana Point, Laguna Niguel and Mission 
Viejo are the same as their original size. The growth of the other cities, on a 
percentage basis, is a study in contrast -- all the way from Los Alamitos' 16% 
growth to Tustin's 3,567%. Here's a comparison of what percentage, in square 
miles, county cities (excepting the aforementioned no-growth four) have grown 
since their incorporation dates:

ON THE WATERFRONT: A NEW HONOR FOR THE 'FASTEST WOMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goldie Joseph, 77, is known as a fast woman. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this year's official program for the Ensenada Yacht Race lists Joseph 
as "the fastest woman" in the 42-year history of the regatta. In 1983, Joseph 
won a first-place trophy in her class and set two records -- fastest race ever 
by a female skipper and fastest wooden boat to finish in any race. 
</P>
<P>
When Joseph accepted her trophy at the spry age of 70, she said: "Everybody 
kissed me because I was the token old lady." 
</P>
<P>
On April 25, Joseph will be honored along with other female skippers, including 
Nancy Hutchinson, Carole Byrne and Peggy Slater. 
</P>
<P>
The idea to turn the spotlight on the female sailors came from Lorin Weiss, 
president of the Newport Ocean Sailing Assn., sponsor of the race. "I felt that 
they deserved to be recognized in the sense that what women are doing today is 
not new," Weiss says. "There have been women in sailing for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss revels the little-known fact that the first Ensenada Yacht Race was won 
by a woman, the late A.L. (Dennie) Barr, who skippered her husband's 46-foot 
sloop across the finish line. When the 43rd annual race sets sail April 27, 
Weiss estimates that women will make up about 15% of the 5,000 sailors aboard 
the 600 boats expected to compete in the event. 
</P>
<P>
Although Goldie Joseph will not be among this year's competitors, she will be 
watching as the fleet takes off at noon near the Newport jetty. Joseph, who 
quit sailing about five years ago, says she has sailed in 12 to 15 Ensenada 
races. She can't remember the exact number, she says, because she's raced in so 
many different events. 
</P>
<P>
She has won more than 100 racing trophies, all of them proudly displayed in her 
waterfront home on Lido Isle. Also on display in front of her home is Bonita, 
the 46-foot wooden sloop Joseph fell in love with and bought 27 years ago. 
Together, she and the boat have logged thousands of miles and have sailed in 
nearly every local race, becoming a legend among the Orange County sailing 
community. Coincidentally, Bonita is the sister ship to the boat sailed by the 
regatta's first winner, Dennie Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, with her colorful wardrobe, twinkling eyes, wide smile and 
narrow-brimmed straw hat, may not look like a salty sea captain, but don't let 
appearances fool you. "Have sextant, will travel," she says and means it. She 
has traveled all the way to Scandinavia to race and has sailed across the 
Pacific to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, whose husband, Sam, does not sail, says she took up the sport in 
mid-life because it looked like fun. "Let's see, how old was I then?" she asks. 
"I was probably in my 40s." 
</P>
<P>
She bought a small sailboat called a Snipe and taught herself how to sail it. 
"I fooled around with it until I figured out how to put up the sails and 
managed to figure out how to make the boat go with the wind," she says. "But I 
never figured out how to stop it. So if I wanted to stop, I'd just hit the 
dock." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph figures she ran into a lot of docks before she decided to sign up for a 
Power Squadron boating course and learn how to sail the proper way. Since then 
she has become quite active in the boating organization and eventually went 
through all the courses, including the tough navigational course. 
</P>
<P>
After completing all the Power Squadron courses, she began to receive 
invitations to crew on other people's boats and was in great demand, she says, 
because "I could cook without getting seasick." Eventually she wrote and 
published her own cookbook called "The Racing Galley," a spiral-bound book that 
she says is waterproofed for wet sailing. One of her books was aboard a boat 
that sank, Joseph says. When the boat was recovered the owner washed the 
cookbook off and it was as good as new. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, when Joseph thought she was ready to sail her own boat, she bought the 
Bonita. "I was 50 years old," she says. "When the women would see me out there 
sailing my boat, they'd look and say, 'What are you doing out there?' The men 
would just sort of look at me." 
</P>
<P>
She recalls one friend who, after watching Joseph in action supervising a male 
crew, remarked: "I was surprised when Goldie told all those men what to do, but 
I was even more surprised when they did it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Joseph no longer sails, she says she has no intention of selling her 
boat. "I'm going to keep her and look at her," she says, smiling broadly. "I 
love to look at her." 
</P>
<P>
The reception honoring Joseph and other female racing skippers will be from 5 
to 8 p.m. April 25 at the Newport Harbor Nautical Museum, 1714 W. Balboa Blvd., 
Newport Beach. The event is open to the public. For information, call (714) 
673-3377. 
</P>
<P>
Other Ensenada Race activities include a pre-race seminar at 7:30 p.m. April 20 
at the Balboa Yacht Club, 1801 Bayside Drive and a pre-race fiesta at 5 p.m. 
April 26 at the Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club, 1601 Bayside Drive, Corona del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Newport Ocean Sailing Assn. is seeking donations for its 
"Hands Across the Border" program. Items needed include clothing, bedding, 
towels, furniture, kitchen supplies (not food), appliances, toys and school 
supplies. Donated items are delivered to Ensenada's needy in large trucks that 
leave Newport Beach by land at about the same time the racing fleet sets sail 
at sea. For information, call (714) 644-9530. 
</P>
<P>
Grunion off-limits: Grunion hunters should be aware that the slippery fish are 
off-limits during April and May so that they will be free from harassment 
during spawning. The next period when grunion may be taken by licensed anglers 
will begin the second week in June, according to the Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
Going fishing: A short seminar on fishing, followed by an ocean fishing trip, 
will be offered today by the Dana Point Harbor Youth and Group Facility. 
Participants should meet at 9:30 a.m. at the Dana Wharf sportfishing dock in 
Dana Point Harbor. For information, call (714) 661-7122.

PARRETTI'S REPORTED REMARKS OUTRAGE MOVIE EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-Semitic remarks attributed to Italian entertainment executive Giancarlo 
Parretti generated alarm in Hollywood on Friday, and several top film 
executives said Parretti's bid to buy MGM/UA Communications Co. will be 
endangered if he fails to explain himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have a real hard time now," said one executive who asked not to 
be named. "This is the one thing, that, if it's proven true, can derail the 
entire deal. This is a very liberal community, and I don't think people are 
going to be happy about working with someone with that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
But Time Warner Inc. Co-Chairman Steven J. Ross, whose firm is providing 
financing for the MGM/UA deal, rose to Parretti's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti, the co-founder of Pathe Communications Co., was quoted as saying, 
"Jews have ganged up on me" in a recent interview with the Italian newspaper, 
L'Unita. He also reportedly charged that Jews control the media. Parretti has 
denied making those statements in the past, but on Friday he refused to discuss 
the controversial remarks with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti is being closely watched in Hollywood these days as he attempts a 
buyout of MGM/UA for $1.2 billion. His chances of pulling the deal off were 
seen as remote until last Monday, when Time Warner offered to put up more than 
half the purchase price in return for the worldwide distribution rights to the 
United Artists film library and future MGM/UA and Pathe releases. 
</P>
<P>
Ross on Friday defended Parretti, saying the embattled executive "has never 
exhibited any prejudice." Ross, who released a prepared statement to The Times 
through his son, pointed out that Time Warner's business deal is with a public 
corporation (Pathe), not Parretti personally. He also questioned the motives of 
Parretti's critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that if studio people are quoted and they're not disclosing who 
they are, that in itself must mean something, especially since most major 
studios with the possible exception of Fox, have contacted Mr. Parretti and/or 
Warner Bros. to negotiate a deal of their own," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many leading film figures questioned how Ross, who is extremely active 
in Jewish and Israeli affairs, can continue doing business with Parretti under 
the current circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
They said Parretti will be treated as an outcast in entertainment circles if 
the remarks attributed to him are not thoroughly and convincingly refuted. 
Besides being offensive, the statements are factually in error, they said, 
noting that studios such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment are owned by such 
non-Jewish owners as the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti's alleged statements also drew fire from the national office of the 
Anti-Defamation League on Friday. Chairman Burton S. Levinson called on the 
Hollywood community to "forcefully reject the anti-Semitic stereotyping and 
bigotry" detailed in the story. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged remarks were made public in the United States by Business Week 
magazine. Editor-in-chief Stephen Shepard said his staff spoke to the reporter 
who interviewed Parretti and personally viewed the videotape of an Italian 
television show in which Parretti made similar, though less inflammatory 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Berg, chief executive of International Creative Management talent agency 
and an acquaintance of Parretti's, said he hopes the film executive can clear 
himself. "If it's true, it's highly unfortunate because it plays into every 
historical stereotype in anti-Semitic thought," Berg said. "I can only hope 
Giancarlo did not say what was reported." 
</P>
<P>
Most others declined to be identified for this story. But the reaction of one, 
who said, "My eyes nearly popped out of my head," when he read the story, was 
fairly typical. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's true, it's horrible," said a major industry executive. "I would 
suspect that the number of people who would want to do business with him would 
be limited. As an anti-Semite, I don't see how he could even function in this 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Added another longtime member of Hollywood's creative community: "It's one 
thing to note that many prominent figures in all aspects of Hollywood are 
Jewish and always have been. It's quite another, however, to make hostile 
statements based on that fact." 
</P>
<P>
One Hollywood executive who is in partnership with Parretti, and who also 
happens to be an Israeli-born Jew, jumped to the embattled businessman's 
defense. Yoram Globus, co-president of Pathe, said Parretti is one of the most 
loving and generous people in Hollywood. Globus also claimed that Parretti has 
made generous donations to Israeli and Jewish causes over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think I would have worked with him?" he asked. "It's ridiculous that 
the media are trying to take the blood out of the man. There is not even an 
inch of anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA, the object of Parretti's desire, released its second quarter financial 
statement Friday and the company continued to report sizeable losses, which 
reflected interest expense and the studio's continued hard luck at the box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 28, MGM/UA reported operating income of $10.3 
million on total operating revenue of $176.8 million, compared to operating 
income in the same period last year of $10.1 million on total revenue of $241.8 
million. The company managed to reduce its net loss from $14.7 million to $9.8 
million.

U.S. TUNA FISHERMEN FEAR DECISION MAY BE FINAL BLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American tuna fishing industry, which has made a home here since World War 
II, has absorbed its share of shocks. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments have seized boats. Foreign fleets have slashed prices on 
tuna, aggressively selling their catch into the U.S. market. One U.S. cannery 
after another was shuttered. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the American fleet survived, if at times just barely. 
</P>
<P>
But the most devastating blow of all may have come Thursday, boat owners and 
industry officials say, when when the three largest U.S. tuna canners announced 
they would no longer buy or sell tuna caught using methods that kill or injure 
dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Marietta Zolezzi, whose husband Julius owns and operates four tuna boats based 
in San Diego, called the canners' action "devastating and tragic. We've been 
fighting this for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Tuna boat owner Leo Correia said he did not know if he could remain in 
business. "The damage is all done . . . I don't know what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
"This could be the last nail on the American tuna boats," said Peter Schmidt, 
president of Marco Seattle, whose Campbell Industries subsidiary in San Diego 
is one of the world's leading builders of the boats that use massive nets, or 
seines, to catch tuna. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 giant boats called purse seiners that are based here catch the bulk of 
their tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific where, for reasons that remain a 
mystery to marine scientists, large schools of tuna are accompanied by schools 
of dolphins. To envelop the tuna in the huge umbrella-shaped purse seine nets, 
the boats invariably snare and drown dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The number of dolphins killed by U.S tuna boats, which catch about 15% of the 
world tuna supply, has declined from 108,000 in 1976 to 12,643 last year, 
largely because of the presence of National Marine Fishery Service observers on 
each voyage. That's significantly below the government's maximum quota of 
20,500 dolphins that can legally be killed annually by U.S. tuna fishermen. 
Implicit in the quota, fishermen say, is an admission by the government that 
some dolphin deaths are inevitable in purse seining. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement, the level of kills is still too high to satisfy 
environmentalists, whose years of pressure finally caused tuna canners to 
switch their policy. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tuna fleet now views the alternatives to traditional fishing 
techniques and patterns as unappealing. 
</P>
<P>
American boats can try to fish in other regions such as the Indian Ocean or 
Western Pacific Ocean where the dolphin phenomenon does not exist. But those 
regions are the scenes of intense competition among Asian, French and Spanish 
boats. Many of the boats in the American fleet are too small to make that great 
a voyage anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet could go after schools of smaller fish in the Eastern Pacific which 
do not attract dolphins, but tuna industry officials say catching "juvenile" 
tuna would be both inefficient and harmful to tuna preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Going after smaller fish also would require the boats to get closer to foreign 
shores, raising the risk of seizure by foreign governments who enforce 200-mile 
territorial limits, said August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat 
Association, a San Diego-based trade group that includes 40 locally based tuna 
boat owners. 
</P>
<P>
Felando ruled out as impractical a large-scale switch to other methods of tuna 
fishing such as pole-and-bait and long-line fishing, both of which require far 
more workers. The pole-and-bait technique involves using lures to catch tuna in 
feeding frenzies and long line fishing is the use of one huge line with 
hundreds of baited hooks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 35 years, the tuna industry's technology and capital investment 
have revolved around the giant purse seiner boats, Felando said, which can 
measure up to 220 feet in length, weigh 1,500 tons or more and cost $10 million 
each. There are about 380 of the ships operating in the world, of which 65 are 
registered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials were skeptical that the U.S. canners' policy switch would 
significantly reduce the killing of dolphins. Foreign tuna seiners would 
continue to fish in the Eastern Pacific but without the supervision of National 
Marine Fishery Service observers. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt foresees the possibility that foreigners' catch could be shipped to 
U.S. canneries via freezer cargo ships, in which tuna from various fishing 
grounds are mixed together, including tuna caught beneath dolphins. In such 
cases, government inspectors would have a hard time determining if tuna was in 
fact dolphin-safe. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, U.S. tuna fishers have proven a hardy lot, adjusting to a series of 
setbacks over which they have had little control. But the number of tuna 
seiners based here has steadily decreased from the peak of 130 vessels in 1976 
that caught a total of 300,000 tons of tuna to the current 40 boats that last 
year caught 275,000 tons, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
The purse seining method was developed by San Diego fishermen in the 1950s as a 
reaction to what Felando described as the "dumping" of low-cost tuna onto the 
U.S. market by Japanese fishermen in an attempt to drive the U.S. fleet from 
the seas. The huge purse seiners not only dramatically increased the size of 
each boat's catch, but the fishing technique relieved boat operators from the 
time and expense of catching and maintaining live-bait fish on board. 
</P>
<P>
The highly productive Eastern Pacific fishing ground, a triangular area that 
stretches from San Diego to Chile to Hawaii, increasingly has been fished by 
tuna boat association members in preference to areas closer to shore partially 
in response to foreign seizures of U.S. tuna boats. Most of the seizures took 
place after the boats intruded in what the governments held were territorial 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
The local boat owners have also been affected by the closure of nearly all 
canneries located on the U.S. mainland. The last of the six canneries once 
located in San Diego closed down in 1984 and local boat owners must now unload 
their fish at cannery plants in American Samoa and Puerto Rico.

WHOLESALE PRICES DROP IN MONTH AS COLD WEATHER EASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wholesale prices fell 0.2% in March as energy and food costs descended from 
cold-weather high levels, the Labor Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.4% decline in energy prices last month helped compensate for the huge 
13.6% surge in this category in January spurred by shortages in home heating 
oil. The 0.6% drop in food prices also reflected the onset of warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
The declines "are basically an expected offset to big increases earlier, and 
the core rate without food and energy is basically unchanged over the past five 
years," said David Wyss, an economic analyst at Data Resources Inc. of 
Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said the March levels show inflation continuing at a moderate rate as 
the economy continues to grow and avoid recession. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, inflation for finished goods was 0.3% -- solidly 
within the 3.5% to 4% annual rate that has prevailed for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a boring report, but if you're a businessman, a little boredom sometimes 
is a blessing," said Wyss. "To live in interesting times is not, in the old 
saying, a blessing. It's a curse." 
</P>
<P>
The March dip in energy prices, combined with February's even bigger 5% drop, 
still did not fully counterbalance January's leap, which was the greatest in 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get lower energy prices for a couple more months because crude oil 
prices are still falling," said Donald Ratajczak, head of the economic 
forecasting project at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "But we'll never 
get all of the way back down the mountain we climbed in January because 
underlying inflation is still going up. There's no sign it's accelerating -- 
but there's no sign it's going to decline toward zero, either." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts saw a hint of good news in one particular increase -- a 2% spurt in 
crude industrial materials. 
</P>
<P>
Prices in this category had dropped 6.4% during the 12 months, reflecting 
sluggish manufacturing activity. The March uptick "seems to be an indication 
industrial activity is picking up, adding inflation at that level," Ratajczak 
said. "We'll have to keep an eye on that." 
</P>
<P>
Also supporting that impression was a 0.4% increase in finished industrial 
equipment. "That suggests the economy is alive and well," said Allen Sinai, 
chief economist of Boston Co. "The capital goods prices mean increased capital 
investment has been happening, and capital spending plans for the future look 
solid. So that's another solid sign of a growing economy, despite all the 
anecdotal evidence you hear of softness." 
</P>
<P>
Sinai noted that the continuation of moderate inflation at the wholesale level 
does not mean that retail inflation will remain moderate. The consumer price 
index, which measures those prices, includes services while the producer price 
index considers the prices of wholesale goods only. Service industries have 
experienced some of the most entrenched inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the producer price index fell by 0.4 point, or 
0.3%, to 117 in March on a base of 100 calculated for wholesale prices in 1982. 
That means a hypothetical market basket of goods that cost $100 eight years ago 
would have cost $117 last month and $117.40 in February.

Nabisco to Sell Pet Snacks Division: Nabisco Brands plans to sell its pet 
snacks division, which makes Milk Bones dog biscuits, to concentrate on making 
"human foods," a company official confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The RJR Nabisco Inc. subsidiary said it had not yet received any offers. The 
pet snacks division employs about 275 people at a plant in Buffalo, N.Y., and 
12 at a kennel in Sherburne, 40 miles southeast of Syracuse, N.Y., where its 
products are tested. The pet snacks division had about $150 million in sales 
last year. Its profit was not disclosed separately from Nabisco's.

Lotus, Novell Sued Over Merger Plan: Two stockholders have gone to court to 
block the proposed $1.4-billion merger of software giants Lotus Development 
Corp. and Novell Inc., the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court seeks an injunction against 
the proposed merger, which sent shares of both companies tumbling after it was 
announced last week. The suit, filed by Novell shareholders Stephen Maskaleris 
and Herbert Podell, contends that Novell and its directors breached their 
fiduciary duties to shareholders in agreeing to merge with Lotus. Novell said 
it and Lotus believe that the suit is without merit and intend to defend 
against it vigorously.

While there are still a number of obstacles to a takeover of the Worcester,

FARWEST SAVINGS' PARENT IN RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parent company of Newport Beach-based FarWest Savings on Friday reported a 
loss of $46.1 million for 1989, suffering from a $105.9-million decline in the 
value of its junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous year, the company reported net earnings of $8.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Losses at the thrift have continued into this year, and it now meets none of 
three federal standards on how much capital it must have. At the end of 1989, 
the savings institution had met one of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest officials said the thrift, owned by FarWest Financial Corp. of Los 
Angeles, is still solvent. They are talking with regulators about a plan to 
raise the thrift's level of capital, its final reserve against losses. The plan 
includes shrinking the firm, cutting costs and altering the S&amp;L's business 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
"In one way, this loss demonstrates the resiliency of the company," said 
Charles H. Green, the thrift's president. "To see that the company was able to 
absorb that hit and still meet one capital test shows the company's strength." 
</P>
<P>
The annual loss at the parent firm, which is controlled by the Belzberg family 
of Canada, also reflects a $45.1-million writedown in assets other than junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest had about 14% of its assets in high-yield, high-risk corporate 
securities known as junk bonds when Congress passed a law in August to rescue 
the beleaguered thrift industry's deposit insurance system. The huge 
restructuring of the industry included a provision requiring thrifts to divest 
themselves of all junk bonds within five years. At the end of December, FarWest 
held about $535 million in junk bonds, or about 12% of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Green said the thrift has reduced its assets to about $4 billion at the end of 
March from $4.3 billion three months earlier and a peak of $4.7 billion last 
summer.

FDA CITES RAGU FOR LABELING ON ITS PASTA SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has cited Ragu Foods Inc. for misleading 
consumers with its "Ragu New! Fresh Italian 100% Natural Pasta Sauce" labeling 
in violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was the word "fresh" and not the word "natural" that was the 
sticking point, said Allen Halper, assistant to the director of the Division of 
Regulatory Guidance at the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"The term 'fresh' in the food name is false and misleading in the labels of 
these foods, which have been made in part from tomato paste and have been 
heat-processed, preserved or cured," Halper said. "Also, the name 'Italian' 
implies a geographic origin of the food" that it does not have. 
</P>
<P>
Ragu must now advise the FDA in writing what it plans to do about the labeling, 
said Donald Plumb, an FDA consumer safety officer. Plumb said the company plans 
to respond by April 20. MARIA L. La GANGA

The Internal Revenue Service will keep its toll-free telephone lines open 
through this afternoon to help taxpayers rushing to meet the midnight Monday 
deadline for filing 1989 tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS said Friday that telephoned tax questions also will be answered into 
the evening Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers to call are listed in the instructions for filling out Forms 1040, 
1040A and 1040EZ. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers with touch-tone telephone service may use the IRS Tele-Tax lines 24 
hours a day. Tele-Tax is a system of tape-recorded explanations of more than 
140 specific topics, including pensions, dependents and the child-care credit. 
Phone numbers and topics also are listed in the IRS instructions.

<P>
The IRS expects one of every five tax returns to be filed next week -- 23 
million out of 111 million due this year. Four of every five returns have been 
qualifying for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
Those who wait until the final hours to file will have to wait another eight 
weeks or so before receiving any refund. When a return is filed on time, the

ANGELS GIVE THE TWINS A HAND, 7-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two nights after Mike Witt played a key role in the kind of game pitchers dream 
of, he endured an inning that pitchers dread. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who shared credit with Mark Langston in a combined no-hitter Wednesday, 
struggled in relief of Jim Abbott Friday night. The Angels' defense also 
struggled, committing three errors in the seventh inning and four overall to 
help the Minnesota Twins rally for a 7-4 victory at Anaheim Stadium before a 
crowd of 33,217. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Angels' three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, the last pitcher in the Angels' rotation to make his season debut, 
pitched into the sixth inning before giving way to Witt. Abbott, who was 
charged with giving up only one earned run, had some trouble early, but left 
with a 4-2 lead, thanks in good part to Lance Parrish's three-run home run in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
That lead disintegrated in the seventh, with Witt pitching. Angel shortstop 
Kent Anderson bobbled two grounders and left fielder Chili Davis misplayed a 
double by Brian Harper, an unusual occurrence for a team that last season had 
the second-best fielding percentage in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Gagne led off the seventh with a single to right and moved to second when 
pinch-hitter John Moses walked. Dan Gladden's easy grounder to short didn't 
stay in Anderson's glove, an error that loaded the bases. Gagne and Moses 
scored on a single to left by pinch-hitter Jim Dwyer. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Puckett hit another seemingly easy grounder to Anderson, who was charging 
in and bobbled it. Dwyer moved to second and Gladden to third. Gary Gaetti then 
flied out to right, deep enough for Gladden to score. Dwyer tried to tag and go 
to third, but Dante Bichette made a fine throw to third to get him. Harper then 
doubled to left. The ball was misplayed by Davis, which enabled Puckett to 
score. Witt hit Gene Larkin with the first pitch, which became Witt's last 
pitch. He left to a mixed sendoff of cheers and jeers. 
</P>
<P>
Witt (0-1) had given up four hits and five runs in 1 2/3 innings, but only one 
run was earned. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bailes came on and walked Hrbek and Gagne to force in a run, but the 
inning ended when Moses -- the ninth Twin to bat -- hit a shot back to Bailes 
for a play at first. Four of the Twins' runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had taken a 4-2 lead during a three-run fourth inning. Davis led off 
with a double, moved to third on Brian Downing's grounder to first and scored 
on Bichette's single to right to give the Angels a 2-2 tie. Then Parrish, who 
had managed only two hits in his previous 11 at-bats this season, hit Allan 
Anderson's 2-2 pitch into the left-field seats for his first home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
It stayed that way through the sixth inning, which Abbott started but couldn't 
finish. Witt got out of that inning unscathed, getting Gaetti and Harper to 
ground into force plays before striking out Kent Hrbek. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson (1-1) allowed eight hits and four runs in six innings but got 
the victory when Minnesota rallied. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough start for Abbott, who labored in the first inning, falling 
behind most batters. With one out, Shane Mack, formerly of UCLA, was walked 
after working the count full, and he advanced to third when Puckett singled to 
right. Abbott walked Gaetti on four straight pitches, prompting a visit to the 
mound by pitching coach Marcel Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Lachemann said appeared to make a difference. Abbott retired the next 
two batters, although Harper hit a fly deep enough to left to score Mack. Then 
Abbott got Larkin to ground to first to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels came back to tie the score in their half of the inning. Devon White 
led off with a sharp single that rolled past left fielder Dan Gladden, White 
going to second on the fielding error. Johnny Ray's sacrifice bunt toward first 
enabled White to move to third. Wally Joyner walked and Anderson's first pitch 
to Davis bounced in the dirt and away from Harper for a wild pitch, which 
allowed White to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins manufactured another run in the fourth. Harper led off with a liner 
to left that took one hop and bounced into the seats, a ground-rule double. 
Larkin hit a grounder back to Abbott, who engaged Harper in a rundown before 
finaly tagging him out. Larkin had time to go to second. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Castillo followed with a grounder to short, on which Larkin initially 
held up. As Kent Anderson's throw was heading toward Joyner, Larkin dashed 
toward third. Joyner's throw to third ended up several rows back in the stands, 
and Larkin was waved home. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A number of Angels took early batting practice Friday afternoon, still trying 
to make up for lost time because of the lockout. "We're still kind of in spring 
training as far as hitting goes," hitting instructor Deron Johnson said. "The 
thing about spring training is that you don't get to see that many breaking 
balls. You've got to see them and adjust. That's what's happened all over 
baseball. Hitting is timing. You've been off six months, and here come these 
guys with forkballs and sliders. Fastball pitchers get hit in spring and then 
you come into the season and see a 2-and-0 curveball and go, 'Holy smokes!' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's prize pupil is third baseman Jack Howell, who was five for seven 
before Friday night's game. That included two hits in three at-bats against 
left-handers, who owned Howell last season. He hit only .140 against 
left-handers in 1989 and .179 over his career. "He got off to a good start, 
which is amazing because he was out a week," said Johnson, referring to the 
sprained left ankle that sidelined Howell until Wednesday. "You can't have 
everybody all hitting at the same time -- you'd rather stagger it, keep three 
or four going at the same time." Howell, however, was hitless in four at-bats 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The saves by Mark Eichhorn Tuesday and Thursday and Mike Witt Wednesday gave 
the Angels' relievers saves in three consecutive games for the first time since 
the relievers recorded six straight from July 6-15, 1988. . . . The MRI test 
done on the left elbow of reliever Bob McClure, showed no tissue damage. 
McClure was placed on the 21-day disabled list retroactive to April 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins acquired infielder Fred Manrique from the Texas Rangers in exchange 
for right-handed pitcher Jeff Satzinger.

Shirley Otto and a few hundred other fans are sitting on wooden bleachers 
before a Continental Basketball Assn. game between the hometown Islanders and 
the Rapid City (S.D.) Thrillers. A dozen future Laker Girls -- dolled-up 
10-year-olds wearing lipstick and leotards -- finish their pregame routine. 
It's tipoff time, and Otto gets ready for the action to begin -- off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see him," Otto says, scanning the gym from her courtside seat. An 
Islander investor, she is awaiting the arrival of Craig A. Case, the embattled 
former president of the team. "He usually comes late," she says sardonically. 
"That way he won't run into any of us." 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders score on a spinning inside move by Luther Burks, and the crowd 
cheers. Otto is too preoccupied to notice. She zeroes in on the last few rows 
of the bleachers, then frowns. "There he is," she says, indicating a heavy-set 
man sliding into his seat. Otto, a widow in her 60s, shakes her head. "He does 
have his nerve, I'll give him that." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Islander basketball. In this, their first, and probably last, 
season, the Islanders won the Western Division title with a 37-19 record, 
making them the most successful expansion team in the CBA's 44-year history -- 
on the court. Off it, they lead the league in controversy and melodrama. "It's 
the real 'Santa Barbara' soap opera," says Bob King, CBA vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
How the world turned for the Islanders this season: Investor Howard Schneider 
goes on talk radio and calls Case, one of the town's leading citizens, a crook; 
the CBA commissioner, a man who could settle a key issue, is killed in a plane 
crash, and the Islanders are kicked out of town, evicted for not paying bills 
and forced to play their playoff games in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a poor motherless team," Otto says. 
</P>
<P>
Normally astute businessmen say they disregarded caution for the chance to 
become an owner of a sports team. All seven investors lost not only their 
money, a total of $610,000, but their team as well -- the league took over the 
Islanders Feb. 23, declaring them "abandoned" and refusing to pay the team's 
creditors an estimated $500,000. Investors are alleging fraud by Case and 
blaming the CBA for contributing to the franchise's problems with questionable 
business practices. Lawsuits are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her losses -- Otto alleges that Case "flimflammed" her out of nearly 
$250,000 -- she still feels deeply about the team. It was her vision that 
helped give Santa Barbara its first professional basketball franchise. Then she 
breathed life into the Islanders with money and nurtured them with emotion, 
attending all 34 home games. The collapse of the franchise, she says, "breaks 
my heart." 
</P>
<P>
"None of us expected to make a fortune," Otto says. "We went in it for fun 
because there's nothing to do in Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Otto didn't want a basketball team in town so she could be merely a patron of 
the athletic arts. She loves the game. "I was born and raised in Indiana," she 
says. "It's in the genes." Her family even had season tickets to the old Ft. 
Wayne Pistons, forebears of the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, she and her husband moved to Santa Barbara. Several years 
ago, Otto's satellite dish pulled in a CBA game from Chicago. She remembers 
seeing a CBA commercial that basically said: "You, too, can own a pro 
basketball team." She stored the information "in the back of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Otto ran into Bill Bertka, longtime Laker assistant coach and a Santa 
Barbara resident. She mentioned the CBA to him and her interest in bringing a 
pro basketball team to town. Bertka, 62, knew Case casually. They often saw 
each other at various charity functions and would sometimes discuss the 
possibility of the CBA putting a team on the West Coast, Bertka says. A year 
after his first conversation with Otto, Bertka brought her and Case together. 
They met for lunch twice. Otto says that Case impressed her as a man who had 
the requisite enthusiasm, drive and connections to go after a CBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Case, a 42-year-old Santa Barbara native, owned the Case Detective Agency and a 
real estate investment company, and he was active in the community -- he is a 
past president of both the Athletic Round Table and the Las Positas Park 
Foundation. Bertka calls him "a very prominent civic leader in the community." 
Otto saw no need to check further. 
</P>
<P>
But had she promptly looked into Case's background, she says, she would not 
have invested. Santa Barbara County Superior Court records indicate that Case 
has been a defendant in several lawsuits. Among them: In 1985, according to 
court records, Santa Barbara Bank and Trust obtained a default judgment against 
Case for $72,195. In addition, Case and his detective agency have been involved 
in dozens of municipal and and small-claims court lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the CBA wanted to expand to the West Coast for the 1989-90 season. 
To make travel and scheduling easier, the league was eager to have two teams in 
California, both starting play in the same season. At a mid-May owners' meeting 
in Iowa, the league granted conditional franchises to Case in Santa Barbara and 
to State Assemblyman Dominic Cortese in San Jose. Each owner had to pay a 
$500,000 franchise fee -- $125,000 down plus three equal installments spread 
over three years -- and provide detailed financial statements plus a mandatory 
letter of credit from a bank guaranteeing the $375,000 balance on the franchise 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
The two franchises were bonded together. According to the minutes of the May 
meeting, "Both teams must qualify together or neither is approved because of 
economic and divisional alignment reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Cortese had his financial package ready in June. Case never did, contrary to 
league rules and strict federal and state guidelines for selling shares in a 
corporation. But the CBA approved both franchises on June 2, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The league kind of took a chance on Santa Barbara," says Dave Cortese, the San 
Jose owner's son who runs the Jammers. "They rushed into it. They never should 
have hitched Santa Barbara's wagon to ours. San Jose was ready." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara wasn't, basically because Case had nothing but promises from 
potential investors. When Case made a presentation to the CBA last May, Cortese 
says, "Representations were made that apparently didn't pan out. But the league 
thought the information they got was correct and reliable." 
</P>
<P>
The league has been burned many times before by undercapitalized franchises. 
About 150 teams have come and gone in CBA history. The league prides itself on 
never having ceased operation -- it traces its lineage back to the 1940s and 
the Eastern Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But the CBA has come under fire for its handling of the Islander situation. 
"They're a bunch of third-rate guys who wanted to be NBA owners and couldn't 
cut it," says Schneider, who owns a Santa Barbara luxury automobile dealership. 
When Schneider became an investor last January, he says he got no satisfaction 
from the league. "They're an arrogant bunch of wise guys," he says. "When we 
went to them (for help), they said drop dead. It wasn't their problem." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the Islander franchise was in trouble. Case, himself not an 
investor, received a check from only one substantial investor until Schneider 
got involved. Of the original $200,000 raised by Case last spring, $175,000 
came from Shirley Otto. But Otto says that Case told her the money was only a 
deposit to the league to obtain the franchise, that it would be refundable if 
she chose to withdraw. Hugh Haferkamp of Santa Barbara, Case's attorney, 
counters that Otto was "clearly and fully advised" of all her options. 
</P>
<P>
Case refused to comment for this story, but a source close to him says he is "a 
victim of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
"The franchise came about quickly, and Craig was always pressed for time," the 
source said. "He decided to go forward on the basis of certain assurances (from 
potential investors) that didn't materialize. It was a perfectly innocent 
thing. I think the only thing you can really say is that Craig's bookkeeping 
was not as good as it should have been." 
</P>
<P>
Case did have investors drop out. He had been counting on Barry Berkus, a Santa 
Barbara architect. But in June, a few days after the franchise was granted, 
Berkus decided not to invest, citing what he calls "a difference in philosophy" 
with Case. Mainly, Berkus says, Case refused to provide full-disclosure 
information to Berkus and other potential investors. Berkus also disputed 
profit-and-loss projections that Case was showing to potential investors. The 
projections showed the Islanders making money their first season, a very 
unrealistic assumption, Berkus and others say. 
</P>
<P>
Although CBA players don't get rich playing basketball -- a team's entire 
player budget for a season is only $90,000, which comes out to $500 a week per 
player -- an owner still has "to expect to lose money his first season," Dave 
Cortese says. 
</P>
<P>
A team's expenses for a season, Cortese estimates, are between $700,000 and $1 
million, and the Jammers "have definitely incurred some cash losses this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of capital, Case forged ahead to prepare for the Nov. 14 
season opener. A staff -- marketing, public relations and community relations 
directors -- was assembled. Players were drafted. A coach, Sonny Allen, 
formerly of Nevada Reno, was hired. But at CBA headquarters in Denver, the 
league was getting very worried. By September, Case still hadn't provided the 
league with any details about shareholders, including their names and the 
percentage of shares they owned, nor had he posted the mandatory letter of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 22 letter to Haferkamp, acting commissioner Jerry Schemmel said it 
was "absolutely mandatory at this point" for Case to come forth with financial 
details. An Oct. 10 letter from Schemmel cited "additional problems . . . that 
are quite serious" and said that Case "was currently in default with the CBA" 
for not posting the letter of credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult dealing with them," Schemmel now says, referring to Case 
and Haferkamp. 
</P>
<P>
Case, through Haferkamp, continually stonewalled the CBA on the 
letter-of-credit issue by contending that Jay Ramsdell had privately waived the 
requirement. Ramsdell had been commissioner of the league. However, he could 
neither confirm nor deny Case's claim because he had been killed July 19 in the 
crash of United Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not aware of any agreement with Jay," Schemmel says. "I have a tough 
time believing Craig on that one." 
</P>
<P>
Corporate law experts say that incorporation is a routine, two-day procedure. 
But the Islanders weren't incorporated by the California Secretary of State 
until Sept. 19, 1989, meaning that the operation was not a legally recognized 
entity for nearly four months, which investors were not told, Otto says. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion also resulted because the CBA had awarded the franchise to 
Professional Basketball in Santa Barbara, Inc. -- the name Case was calling the 
entity. But the California Secretary of State lists the corporation as Santa 
Barbara Islanders, Inc. "We originally gave the franchise to a corporation that 
didn't legally exist," Schemmel says. Case reportedly still has banks accounts 
under both corporate names. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, the Islanders were playing Allen's fast-breaking offense and 
leading the league in scoring with an average of 128 points. Not that Santa 
Barbara noticed. Maybe it was the $15 ticket price -- highest in the league -- 
but there were believed to be only about 400 hard-core Islander fans, including 
about 250 season ticket-holders. The CBA says the Islanders' regular-season 
average attendance was 1,940 in the 2,500-seat Santa Barbara City College 
Sports Pavilion, but a source claims that Case gave away a large number of 
tickets for most games. 
</P>
<P>
"We love our Islanders," says David Avrick, who has season tickets with his 
wife. "What happened is just a shame. They were the most exciting team in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
By the first of this year, while the Islanders were headed for the playoffs and 
the record of most victories by an expansion team, the franchise was in 
turmoil. Creditors, notably City College, were pressing Case for payment. 
That's when he went to Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, 46, owns Gregg Motors, which he says has $100 million in annual 
sales. He was an original Islander season ticket-holder, becoming one at the 
request of his 14-year-old son, Gregg. Schneider knew Case from charities in 
which they were both involved. Case approached him on Jan. 11. "He said he had 
an emergency need for capital to pay the players," Schneider says. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider immediately wrote a check for $12,500. "I usually do a lot of digging 
before I put any money in anything, but I didn't do a diligent search," 
Schneider says. "I just acted impulsively because the team was involved." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider kept "writing checks" to Case, four overall. He says he gave Case a 
total of $42,500 and then "all of a sudden realized I was in for some serious 
money." 
</P>
<P>
The more Schneider got involved, the more he grasped the corporation's 
peculiarities. There had never been stock certificates or meetings with 
investors or corporate minutes. On Jan. 31, Schneider assembled all seven 
investors along with Case, Haferkamp and a court reporter. At the end of the 
seven-hour meeting at a law firm, the investors voted unanimously to remove 
Case as president and put the team in Schneider's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider says he never would have become involved had he known about the 
team's financial problems. But he says Case told the investors during January 
that the franchise was only $50,000 in debt. Schneider also says that the CBA 
never mentioned any problems with the franchise. In a mid-January conference 
call with two CBA owners and new CBA Commissioner Irv Kaze, Schneider says, "I 
asked them, 'Is everything OK?' and they said, 'Oh, yeah, all it needs is the 
front office cleaned up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schneider says he also asked them, "How is Case's standing with you?" and they 
replied, "We're current with him." But the CBA did have several problems with 
the Islanders at that time -- for instance, it was trying to collect $90,000 in 
travel fees and the illusive collateral from Case. The CBA office had also 
withheld about $50,000 -- the club's share of NBA money -- from the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
"The CBA knew what was going on," Schneider says. "They're culpable for 
allowing this monster to be created by prior management." 
</P>
<P>
The league blames their misstatements to Schneider on the confusion in 
transfering the stewardship of the CBA from Schemmel to Kaze, who took over as 
commissioner Jan. 2. "I only went by what Case had told me -- I had met him in 
January and he said things were excellent," says Kaze, a former executive with 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take Schneider long to figure out that the franchise he was now 
running was anything but excellent. "The day after the (Jan. 31) meeting, we 
were in Case's office and found huge stacks of unopened bills," Schneider says. 
</P>
<P>
In going over the Islanders' books, Schneider says, he also found checks for 
more than $100,000 made out to Case. A source close to Case claims that Case 
had lent the money to the team and was simply paying himself back. But 
Schneider says he asked for copies of checks Case allegedly made out to the 
team, but Case never provided them. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider appointed investor Bill Richling as general manager and they ran the 
Islanders for three weeks, eight games in all. But more bills were arriving in 
the mail. Despite "pumping up the team" with about $200,000 of his own money -- 
plus a few thousand more from Otto and other investors -- Schneider added up 
the bills and was startled to discover that the franchise debts didn't total 
$50,000 but more like $500,000. There was $40,000 owed to a bank, $25,000 to 
the state and federal governments for payroll taxes, $12,000 to City College 
for arena rental and dozens of other payables. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, the CBA owners met at the Santa Barbara Inn, but nobody from 
the Islanders was allowed to attend unless the league was paid the outstanding 
$90,000 in travel fees. The CBA also didn't recognize Schneider as the new head 
of the Islanders because he hadn't been approved by the league. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to meet with the owners, Schneider phoned in a proposal that could have 
resolved most of the franchise's problem. The investors would pay off the 
outstanding bills and continue to run the team, he said over the phone, if the 
CBA would waive the $375,000 franchise-fee balance. The league turned him down, 
then countered with an offer that only gave Schneider's group an 8% discount on 
the franchise fee. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners took the position, 'Why should we help you pay your debts? Nobody's 
helping us,' " Dave Cortese says. "The league was not responsible for the 
Islanders' bills." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider and the other investors promptly advised the CBA that they were 
discontinuing their involvement with the Islanders. CBA attorney Alan 
Rothenberg of Los Angeles then sent Case a certified letter dated Feb. 23, 
saying the league was taking over the operation of the franchise for the rest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Multiple and material breaches of (the franchise) agreement, as well as 
numerous violations of the CBA bylaws have previously been called to your 
attention and have not been cured," the letter stated. "Termination of your 
franchise is justified on many grounds." 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders became orphans, then homeless when City College evicted them just 
before the playoffs. Playing all six "home" playoff games at Ventura College, 
they advanced to the best-of-seven semifinals before being eliminated by Rapid 
City last Tuesday night, four games to two. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider took some heat from fans for backing out of the Islanders, so he 
explained his reasons on radio talk shows and in newspaper articles, using 
strong words not usually heard in this quiet, genteel seaside community where, 
according to punsters, citizens are either "newly wed or nearly dead." 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, there was shock radio in Santa Barbara: "I found out the 
people I was dealing with were a bunch of crooks," he said on the air and in 
print. "Case lied to us and robbed all the investors. This is the most 
mismanaged, mis-run, fraudulent, misrepresented thing I've ever seen in 28 
years of business." 
</P>
<P>
The source close to Case dismisses Schneider's claims. "The problem with 
Schneider is ego. He said the owners don't know how to run the league. They've 
been running it for 44 years; he'd been in it for 44 minutes and he was telling 
them how to do business. They rebuffed him, and now he's blaming (Case) for 
everything that went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders' front-office problems may have upset some people but had 
virtually no effect on team morale. "The players always got paid, and they 
don't care who the owners are," says Allen, the team's coach. The players, in 
fact, don't have much more than a fuzzy concept of the corporate quagmire. "The 
first owner messed up, and the others took over and then backed out and left us 
hanging," says 6-foot-10 forward Brian Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
The players also say they're ambivalent about the team's future. After all, 
their goal is getting out of Santa Barbara and into the NBA (during the season, 
four Islanders were called up, including Jawaan Oldham by the Lakers). 
</P>
<P>
But Allen wants to stay. "I like living in Santa Barbara. That's one of the 
reasons I took this job," he says. Allen, 54, was living in Las Vegas, coaching 
the Silver Streaks to the World Basketball League title, when Case called last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Allen recently approached Berkus, who had originally decided against investing, 
about bailing out the franchise, but Berkus says, "I haven't made up my mind." 
The possibility also exists, sources say, that the CBA may simply disband the 
Islanders and move a franchise from either Topeka, Kan., or Wichita Falls, 
Tex., to Santa Barbara. So fans, of Santa Barbara -- the team, not the soap 
opera -- might still wind up with pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we can get this resolved in a very happy way for a lot of people," Kaze 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, Case has told associates that he will not be involved. Stay 
tuned.

TONIGHT.

When Michael Nunn, the unbeaten International Boxing Federation middleweight 
champion, fights World Boxing Council welterweight champion Marlon Starling 
tonight, it will be Team Turmoil vs. Team Tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn (34-0), in a bitter split with the management team that had guided his 
career since 1984, walked out of training camp March 17. However, a meeting was 
underway late Friday night in what sources said was an attempt to resolve the 
fued between Nunn and his manager, Dan Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
Starling (45-5-1), in contrast to such turmoil, seems happy and confident. And 
he is laughing at the 6-1 odds favoring Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, at 6 feet 2, will tower over Starling, who claims to be 5-8. Nunn will 
also have a huge reach advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Starling, reach advantages can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
At his training camp in Fountain Hills, Ariz., two weeks ago, Starling rolled 
his eyes when a reporter raised the subject. He put his face two inches from 
the reporter's. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you this question," he said. "What good will Nunn's reach do him, 
when my face is right here?" 
</P>
<P>
Starling, 31, is from Hartford, Conn., and has been a professional since 1979. 
He received little recognition until 1987 when, in an upset, he knocked out 
Mark Breland in Columbia, S.C., and won the World Boxing Assn. welterweight 
title. 
</P>
<P>
He defended that championship twice, including a Las Vegas draw with Breland. 
He was beating Tomas Molinares in Atlantic City, N.J., one night in 1988 when 
Molinares hit him after the bell ending the sixth round and knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, the fight was declared "no decision" by New Jersey boxing 
officials, but the WBA recognized Molinares as champion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Starling won the World Boxing Council welterweight crown by knocking 
out Lloyd Honeyghan in Las Vegas. He successfully defended it against South 
Korean Yungkil Chung last September. 
</P>
<P>
He has never fought a true middleweight, but insists he is a natural 
middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
"Before my last fight (against Chung), I went into training camp at 169 pounds, 
got down to 147 and won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Between fights, I'm walking around at 165. Hey, this is right for me. This is 
luxury, being able to fight at 160. This is the first time in my career I 
haven't had to train in (rubber) sauna suits." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like Ray Leonard, I'm a moneyweight fighter. I'll fight where the money 
is. After I beat Nunn, I think I'll fight at light-heavy. Or maybe I'll go down 
and fight Julio Cesar Chavez." 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time a welterweight champion has taken on a middleweight 
champion for the latter's title since 1974, when Jose Napoles unsuccessfully 
challenged middleweight champion Carlos Monzon. 
</P>
<P>
Starling is managed by Mort Sharnik, former Sports Illustrated boxing writer 
and CBS boxing consultant. He said Nunn's management problems probably won't be 
a factor in the outcome tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the bell rings, I don't think Nunn will give a thought to any of that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fighters tend to be very focused on fighting -- Muhammad Ali had all kinds of 
problems outside the ring but he never let them affect his performance." 
</P>
<P>
Starling seemed to sympathize with Nunn at a news conference Thursday when he 
pointed to "New Wave media" representatives and asked: "Any of you guys do 
roadwork? Any of you get hit? Any of you have fights with your manager? It's 
tough, sometimes, just to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Starling predicted a reduction in the odds on the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"If you could look into Michael Nunn's mind right now, you'd see those odds 
dropping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at my career, who I've fought, what I've done. Then look at who 
Nunn's fought. Then you look at those odds again." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, who lives in Agoura Hills, will earn $1.1 million tonight, Starling 
$675,000. 
</P>
<P>
And for the winner, bigger purses await. Sharnik said Starling could receive $1 
million to fight Chavez or Hector Camacho, win or lose against Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, 26, said he is no longer interested in unifying the middleweight 
division. He said Thursday that he might move up and challenge Virgil Hill for 
the WBA light-heavyweight championship.

<P>
University of Portland basketball Coach Larry Steele was reported resting 
comfortably after undergoing a surgical procedure to correct an irregular 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Steele's wife, Vicki, said doctors at Oklahoma Memorial Hospital in Oklahoma 
City believe the six-hour procedure was a success. 
</P>
<P>
Steele's team was Loyola Marymount's opponent March 4, the night Hank Gathers 
collapsed and died. Gathers had an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Steele, a former Portland Trail Blazer and University of Kentucky player, had 
been diagnosed as having Wolf Parkinson syndrome. The condition is caused by an 
extra electrical pathway in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Steele has said he plans to return to work on Monday.

SAILING: FIRST LAYOVER IN U.S. COULD BE LAST 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the arrival of the leaders, this is the first time the Whitbread Round the 
World Race for the Beefeater Trophy -- that's two sponsor plugs in a single 
title -- has touched U.S. shores, and it could be the last. 
</P>
<P>
However significant in sailing circles, the event is probably less historic 
than Columbus' arrival in the West Indies 498 years ago. There are no American 
entries -- two prospects failed to find funding -- although several Americans 
are sailing on boats in the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The Whitbread, which started in England on Sept. 2, scheduled Ft. Lauderdale 
this time only because some potential sponsors weren't thrilled that the past 
four biennial races had used Cape Town, South Africa, for one of five layovers 
in the 32,932-nautical-mile race. So, it was decided that it would be in 
everyone's interest to scuttle South Africa and substitute Ft. Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
Any old port in a political storm. 
</P>
<P>
The switch created a strange route that included one grueling 7,650-mile leg 
through the frigid and ferocious Southern Ocean from Punta del Este, Uruguay, 
to Fremantle, Australia, then a second stop at Punta del Este on the way home. 
Now there is discussion about including both Ft. Lauderdale and Cape Town in 
the 1994 event and eliminating Fremantle and one stop in Uruguay. In other 
words, the route would go from England to Ft. Lauderdale to Cape Town to New 
Zealand to Punta del Este to England. 
</P>
<P>
Stopping first in Ft. Lauderdale might be a good idea, catching Americans 
before they become bored with the whole thing. Despite the danger and 
excitement of survival conditions, sailing's most competitive ocean racing 
event is of much greater interest in the rest of the world than it is here. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been boring for the 23 boats. That would include Martela, the Finnish 
entry that lost its keel and went belly up on the fourth leg in February. Two 
other boats altered course to rescue the 16 crewmen, who survived and will be 
able to watch highlights of their adventure on ESPN Monday at 7 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. professional sailing series got underway last weekend. Australia's 
Peter Gilmour, after a mediocre showing in the Congressional Cup off Long Beach 
last month, sailed a neon pink Ultimate 30 to victory in a five-boat fleet at 
Haleiwa on Oahu's north shore to earn $59,500. Following were John McLaurin, 
Los Angeles, $27,500; Mike Hobson, Annapolis, $16,500; Bill Ziegler, Darien, 
Conn., $12,700, and Russell Long, San Francisco, $5,500. Gilmour's sponsor flew 
the boat to Hawaii from Australia via Japan by Federal Express. Brothers 
Jonathon and Charlie McKee, 1984 and '88 Olympic medalists, respectively, from 
Seattle, won the One-Design 14 class and $9,250. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Smyth, formerly of Huntington Beach and now from Mary Esther, Fla., 
opened defense of his two consecutive ProSail titles by defeating challengers 
Jack Halterman, Santa Cruz, 3-1, Brett Dryland, Australia, 3-1, and Randy 
Hatfield, Dana Point, 3-0, in a series of best-of-five match races for modified 
Formula 40 catamarans at New Bern, N.C. ProSail's new format has everybody else 
sailing against Smyth. Anyone who beats him wins $100,000. Smyth gets a salary 
from his sponsor, SuperLube, plus each $5,000 entry fee over three entries. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Sailing Assn. of Santa Monica Bay has a daysail scheduled on April 
22, with non-members welcome. Information: (818) 786-8173.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: UCI FRIENDS OF LIBRARY WILL HONOR O.C. WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the recipient of the UC Irvine Friends of the Library's first Fiction Award 
in 1966, E.M. (Mick) Nathanson of Laguna Niguel jokes that "I was the only one 
around, so they grabbed me." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, 17 books were submitted in three categories -- fiction, nonfiction 
and juvenile -- the first year the library support group honored county 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Nathanson's novel, "The Dirty Dozen," that the Friends deemed "the 
most outstanding" in the fiction category. Also honored that year in nonfiction 
was UCI history professor Arthur J. Marder of Newport Beach for his history of 
the Royal Navy and Leon Ware of San Juan Capistrano for his book in the 
juvenile category. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends' first annual authors recognition dinner was held at the Sheraton 
Inn in Huntington Beach in May, 1966, with TV personality Frank Baxter, 
professor emeritus of English at USC, as guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Nathanson, who was presented a plaque and delivered a brief thank-you 
speech to the assembled crowd of 400: "I was elated to be noticed by my 
community, and I felt great joy that the Friends of the Library had taken note 
of this novel." 
</P>
<P>
The UCI Friends of the Library is still taking note of Orange County authors. 
</P>
<P>
After a number of years selecting "the most outstanding" among an increasing 
number of submissions, however, the library support group quit making 
individual awards and began giving equal honor to all Orange County authors who 
had books published the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 50 authors who had books published in 1989 will be 
recognized at the Friends' 25th annual Authors Recognition Dinner at 7 p.m. 
April 29, at the Irvine Marriott. The keynote speaker will be literary agent 
Robert Gottlieb of the William Morris Agency in New York, whose impressive list 
of clients includes the best-selling Tom Clancy. (Gottlieb has described the 
megabuck sale of Clancy's next thriller to Putnam/Berkley as being no less than 
"the deal of the century.") Other Gottlieb clients include Stephen Coonts, 
Donald T. Regan, Caspar Weinberger and Alexandra Ripley (the author who is 
writing the sequel to "Gone With the Wind"). 
</P>
<P>
The event is open to the public and tickets ($25 each) may be obtained by 
calling the Friends of the Library office at (714) 856-5300. 
</P>
<P>
During a social hour beginning at 5:30, all the honored books will be on 
display and guests will have an opportunity to chat with the authors in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
As in past years, this year's crop of honored books and authors spans a diverse 
range: from William E. Dannemeyer's "Shadow Land: Homosexuality in America" to 
romance novelist Suzanne Forster's "Wild Honey," and from Jess J. Araujo's "The 
Law and Your Legal Rights" to E.C. Ward's Orange County mystery "A Nice Little 
Beach Town." 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Taylor, who is being recognized for two novels published last year -- 
his adult thriller "Monocolo" and his young adult thriller "Sniper" -- is an 
old hand at the annual literary gathering: This will be the Laguna Beach 
author's eighth dinner as an honoree. "It's a nice social affair," said Taylor, 
whose book "Sniper" also has been nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery 
Writers of America. "You get a chance to schmooze with other writers in the 
county. You don't really get a chance to see them that often. I don't anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Femling of Costa Mesa, honored for her Newport Beach-set thriller "Hush, 
Money," is looking forward to the dinner for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fun to see the other authors in the county," she said. "One knows 
a few, but it's really interesting to see people who have just been names to 
you before." 
</P>
<P>
For first-time honoree Jo-Ann Mapson of Costa Mesa, who is being recognized for 
her collection of short stories, "Fault Line," being acknowledged by the 
Friends of the Library is just plain "great." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel delighted that they want to honor my book and I'm a little nervous," 
she said. "I'm excited to be going to the dinner, and I'm really looking 
forward to hearing Robert Gottlieb. Wow! Big time!" 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine Friends of the Library is the university's oldest support group. 
And, with 2,700 members, it is considered the largest Friends of the Library 
organization in the nation. A $25 annual membership fee entitles members to a 
university library card, which, given its reputation as a research library, is 
an added bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the Friends have made substantial donations to the library, 
including the purchase of a complete microform collection of the New York Times 
and London Times. 
</P>
<P>
During the year, the group hosts various breakfasts and luncheons for members, 
but the annual author recognition dinner is the most anticipated event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really the highlight of each year," said John B. Cobb, a Newport Beach 
attorney, who is the group's current president. "It takes a lot of work, but it 
does bring us together and also it re-establishes our relationship with the 
authors." 
</P>
<P>
Muriel Reynolds of Newport Beach, who co-founded the Friends with B.N. 
Desenberg of Newport Beach, said the idea for the annual dinner was to put the 
group on the map. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious we had to do something to have recognition so that we could get 
members and be a strong organization, and this is how we did it," said 
Reynolds, who attended the first dinner and plans to be at the 25th. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dinner has really been a successful thing -- it has always been packed," 
Reynolds said. "People are interested because we celebrate the authors of 
Orange County, and I think it gets to be more of a tradition every year." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the best efforts of the Friends' book committee, the list of authors 
being honored each year does not necessarily reflect every Orange County writer 
who had a book published the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Eleanor Savage, book committee chairman, said letters are sent to previous 
honorees notifying them of the upcoming dinner and the deadline for submitting 
their novels published the previous year. Flyers also are sent to libraries and 
writing groups asking for nominations. And, during the year, members keep their 
eyes out for newspaper stories about local authors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a hard thing for us to reach out, but we certainly try," Savage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of honorees who nevertheless make the list each year reads like a 
"Who's Who" of the county's constantly growing literary community. 
</P>
<P>
Savage said: "We feel very proud of the fact so many of our authors who have 
started out with us are now (recognized) nationwide like Dean Koontz, T. 
Jefferson Parker, A.E. Maxwell and Robert Ray." 
</P>
<P>
Ray, alas, moved to Seattle last December and, as Savage noted, "will no longer 
qualify." 
</P>
<P>
But Ray's most recent mystery, "Merry Christmas, Murdock" was published in 1989 
while Ray was still living in Irvine and it will be honored this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, however, won't be flying down for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview from Seattle, Ray said he enjoyed attending a previous 
dinner where he met Laguna Beach science fiction author Gregory Benford: "We 
split a bottle of wine," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, who is currently revising a thriller that deals with money laundering, 
even more fondly recalls the author reception hosted by the Friends of the 
Library in the weeks before the dinner. That's one part of the Friends' 
literary tradition that was phased out a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled the self-described "guerrilla book marketer" with a chuckle: "I sold a 
bunch of books there. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
Open House: The new UC Irvine Bookstore will host a weeklong open house 
beginning Monday and continuing through next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. Monday, Irvine-based Pacific Writers Press will host a reception and

<TEXT>
<P>
When President Bush watched U.S. soldiers performing war games in the Mojave 
Desert recently, he warned them that despite plans to scale back forces in 
Europe and Asia, America must remain "prepared to fight." 
</P>
<P>
"God bless you . . . and now, back to war," he told the Ft. Irwin troops as 
they paused briefly in their simulated battle between the United States and a 
Red Army brigade. 
</P>
<P>
The President's remarks were reminiscent of another line: "Praise the Lord and 
pass the ammunition!" immortalized at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. Chaplain 
Howell M. Forgy shouted the encouragement to a chain of men loading guns aboard 
the cruiser New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of the U.S. military chaplain walking a fine line, upholding the 
principles of religion and peace in organizations geared to the rigors of war, 
dates to the Civil War, when Army chaplains ministered to soldiers on the 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
And it continues today. In the latest U.S. military skirmish in Panama, 
chaplains from the 7th Infantry Division at Ft. Ord and the 82nd Airborne 
Division from Ft. Bragg, N.C. -- testing their mettle in the throes of battle 
after a long period of peace -- went along with the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The airborne chaplains parachuted right down with them," said Lt. Col. Dean 
Ruddle, chaplain recruiter for the 6th Army. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. John Wells, division chaplain for the 7th Infantry, compared the 
experience to Vietnam and said it was the first time since 1968 that chaplains 
and chaplains' assistants were deployed as a unit to a combat situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty proud of our division," he said of the 16 chaplains under him. 
"Battalion chaplains were as close to the front lines as possible . . . giving 
a spiritual presence and a calmness prior to battle." 
</P>
<P>
The need for chaplains will decrease accordingly if U.S. troop strength and 
military installations are reduced decisively, as proposed by the Defense 
Department. More than 100 military installations around the world have been 
proposed for elimination or consolidation because of the relaxing of tensions 
in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But military chaplains are not now an endangered species. In fact, military 
recruiters predict that a shortage of Roman Catholic chaplains will continue 
for the foreseeable future. And despite the changing atmosphere, events such as 
the U.S. invasion of Panama could happen again. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only the Navy has indicated plans to slightly reduce its chaplain corps 
-- from a present 1,138 to 1,116 by 1994. The Navy also supplies the Marines 
and Coast Guard with chaplains. Spokesmen for the Army and Air Force said it is 
too early to tell what cuts, if any, the military reductions will mean for 
their chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 12,000 military chaplains and assistants of 162 faiths serve 3.8 million 
members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, National Guard and reserves 
and their families, in addition to military veterans. Leaders of these 
ministers in uniform agree that their work and religious ideals are neither 
inconsistent nor compromised. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to talk about the peace of Jesus while working on an ammunition 
ship," conceded Rear Adm. Alvin B. Koeneman, Navy chief of chaplains. "But 
sailors live in that situation. Someone needs to be there to live the 
contradiction with them and wrestle with it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Maj. Gen. Norris Einertson, Army chief of chaplains: "My parishioners 
(Army personnel) are contributing to peace in a troubled world. The military's 
first function is to keep the peace, not make war." 
</P>
<P>
And Lt. Col. Walter H. Quandt, senior chaplain at George Air Force Base near 
Barstow, said: "No one in the military wants war, but we are asked by our 
country to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Readiness for the Army means looking for a few more good men -- 352, to be 
exact -- to become Roman Catholic chaplains, as well as several more rabbis, 
both male and female. Despite plans to slightly reduce its overall chaplain 
corps in four years, the Navy would like 15 more Jewish chaplains and 20 
Catholic priests. The Air Force needs 30 more Roman Catholic and two Eastern 
Orthodox priests. 
</P>
<P>
The military doesn't yet have a Buddhist chaplain, but that is expected soon. 
Two years ago, the Defense Department for the first time authorized the 
Buddhist chaplaincy. And when he is commissioned, the Rev. Hiroshi Abiko, who 
serves the Palo Alto Buddhist Temple in Northern California, will become the 
first official U.S. military chaplain of his faith. 
</P>
<P>
Because quotas for military chaplains roughly follow the percentages of 
personnel identifying with each faith group, the Roman Catholic Church, 
representing from one-fourth to one-third of military personnel, requires the 
single largest number of chaplains. But, according to Archbishop Joseph T. 
Ryan, who heads the nation's Archdiocese for the Military Services, the 
Catholic share of the chaplain corps is only 13%, with a current total of 681 
chaplains on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of Catholic chaplains is especially acute in the Army, where the 
ratio of active-duty priests to Catholic personnel is about 1 to 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
"A priest in field maneuvers may do eight to 10 Masses a weekend -- minimum," 
said Maj. Gregory P. Sykes, Catholic chaplain recruiter in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maj. Charles Gunti, another full-time Army chaplain recruiter, 
mailings and brochures have gone out to every priest in the United States, 
asking them to consider a shorter, two-year (instead of three-year) stint in 
the chaplaincy before returning to a civilian parish. In addition, older 
priests are now allowed to stay on active duty to age 65 -- three years past 
the usual mandatory retirement. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Army chaplains' office is advertising for priests in the 
Catholic press and has hired a high-powered New York advertising agency to plug 
a "chaplain candidate" program. The plan is designed to induce seminarians to 
enter the Army Reserve or National Guard and be paid while still in school. 
After ordination, commissioning and three years' pastoral experience in a 
civilian diocese, the candidate would be ready for active duty as a chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
"As an Army priest," says a recruiting brochure, "you'll minister to officers 
and enlisted men and women, their family members, hospital patients, prisoners. 
You'll officiate at a wedding one day, hear confession in a pine forest the 
next." 
</P>
<P>
But despite aggressive recruiting at most of the nation's Catholic seminaries, 
the Army is gaining an average of 14 new priests a year, and retirees are 
outpacing new recruits. The Navy and Air Force chaplain candidate programs are 
having only slightly better results attracting Catholic priests. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there's no shortage of white male Protestant candidates from major 
denominations. And chaplains representing conservative, evangelical churches 
are in abundant supply. But chaplains of racial minority groups and female 
chaplains tend to be under-represented. 
</P>
<P>
Because the overall number of U.S. Catholic priests has declined drastically 
during the last two decades, competition is keen for the few men who are 
preparing for ordination. And some bishops are reluctant to see their valuable 
priests disappear from the local scene for far-off military duty. 
</P>
<P>
In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the nation's most populous with 3.5 million 
Catholics, 83,000 members serve in the armed forces worldwide. But there are 
only 11 active-duty military chaplains, including three serving the Veterans 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although four seminarians in final years of study at St. John's Seminary in 
Camarillo are preparing for the chaplaincy, the school -- which supplies 
priests for the archdiocese -- is one of a handful that no longer allow 
chaplain recruiting on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony "thinks we are sheep-stealing, I've been 
told," Army recruiter Gunti said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. George Niedenauer, rector at St. John's Seminary, said the school doesn't 
allow new chaplain candidates because the seminary's summer internship program 
conflicts with the chaplain candidacy summer camp. But Gunti said the conflict 
could be worked out: "We work with other seminaries that have similar 
arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Thomas J. Curry, vicar for Los Angeles priests, said the archdiocese's 
policy is to replace a priest who returns from active duty with another 
chaplain. But, if they don't return to the archdiocese -- or if they die or 
retire while in the military -- "we tend not to replace them," Curry explained. 
</P>
<P>
The two dozen reserve and active-duty chaplains interviewed for this story said 
their military service had been a good experience; many said they would like to 
make the chaplaincy a career. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, I love it," said Lt. Betty Lawson, 31, who has been a Navy chaplain 
for four months. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson works with up to 1,600 all-male boot-camp recruits between the ages of 
18 and 21 at the Naval Training Station in San Diego. Her husband, Greg, is 
also a Navy chaplain, assigned to the 450-member crew of the cruiser William H. 
Standley in San Diego.

Lawson, ordained by an independent evangelical charismatic church group, said 
she finds "nothing negative" in working strictly with men. 
</P>
<P>
"When people need a chaplain, they're looking for someone who can help; they 
don't care if it's a man or a woman," she said. Overall, women make up 10.8% of 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of her work, Lawson said, is "seeing these recruits very involved 
in worship." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego training station has one of the largest religious programs in the 
Navy, offering 13 worship services each weekend -- including Jewish, 
Seventh-day Adventist, Roman Catholic, "general" Protestant, Latter-day Saints 
(Mormon), Eastern Orthodox, Islam and Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson works with 15 other chaplains, including Lt. Mark Koczak, one of the 
Navy's nine Orthodox priests. Like most chaplains, Koczak spends a major share 
of his time counseling -- 385 personnel sought him out in the last three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
And what do they talk about? "Getting out of the Navy and changing orders 
(assignments) are the two big concerns," Koczak said. 
</P>
<P>
Chaplain Ruddle, a Seventh-day Adventist, said he is challenged to help young 
members of the military "find answers and values in life when they find 
themselves with a gun in their hands . . . things they're not willing to face 
out there in civilian life." 
</P>
<P>
Col. Shimon Paskow, an Army Reserve rabbi, is attached to the Health Services 
Command and also serves a temple in Thousand Oaks. He thinks chaplains have a 
special entree to 18- to 30-year-olds and that rabbis should be "more involved" 
in the chaplaincy. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. John Dawson, pastor of St. Sebastian's Catholic Parish in West Los 
Angeles and an Army Reserve chaplain, likes the authority a chaplain wields. 
</P>
<P>
"The chaplaincy is an escape valve to relieve stress; you can cut through red 
tape for immediate or pressing problems. You can go to whoever is in charge -- 
including the general," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chaplains mentioned other reasons they prefer the military life: the 
stimulation of working with those of different faiths; overseas assignments; 
unlimited accessibility to personnel in an informal atmosphere, and relative 
freedom from administrative tasks found in civilian parishes, such as dealing 
with church mortgages and raising funds. 
</P>
<P>
But there are drawbacks too. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent moves, family separations and hardship assignments can take their 
toll, chaplains said. Because of rotation, personnel turnover at a typical Air 
Force base is about 100% within three years, according to Chaplain Quandt of 
George AFB, making for a transient congregation rather than a longtime 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
And chaplains affiliated with minority religious groups sometimes find the 
going lonely when they are isolated from other clergy of their faith, Eastern 
Orthodox Chaplain Koczak noted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, few chaplains seemed ready to turn in their military insignia. 
</P>
<P>
"The luster still continues," says Air Force Col. Bill Mattimore, 63, with 33 
years experience as a chaplain. "Working with people has been the best thing 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHAPLAIN STRENGTH 
</P>
<P>
Protestant military chaplains are slightly above required quotas, but a 
critical need exists for more Roman Catholic priests. Jewish chaplains are also 
under-represented.

EASTER SERVICES ABOUND ACROSS THE SOUTHLAND; 
</P>
<P>
RITES: THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS CENTURY THAT THE DATE OF THE HOLIDAY 
COINCIDES FOR WESTERN AND EASTERN CHURCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Southern Californians will celebrate Easter late 
tonight and early Sunday, the last time this century that the date of 
Christendom's most important holiday coincides for Western and Eastern 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Christian tradition requires that the day recalling Gospel accounts of 
Jesus' resurrection be observed after the start of the Jewish holiday of 
Passover, in keeping with the sequence in the New Testament. Although the 
Easter dates for the two branches of Christianity usually coincide every four 
or five years, the next time will not be until April 15, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
The 70th renewal of the Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service, which follows 
the Western religious calendar, will reflect the dual celebration this year by 
having two principal sermons -- one by Father James Pappas, a priest at Los 
Angeles' St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral, and the other by Episcopal Bishop 
Frederick Borsch of the six-county Los Angeles Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor sunrise services are a popular tradition in the normally balmy 
Southland. The services atop Mt. Rubidoux in Riverside and Mt. Helix in La Mesa 
have been held even longer than the Hollywood Bowl observance. 
</P>
<P>
But few Orthodox Christians are likely to show up. That's because the 
liturgical high point for Eastern Christians comes at midnight tonight when 
darkened church interiors are brightened to proclaim "Christ is Risen." 
</P>
<P>
At St. Katherine Greek Orthodox Church in Redondo Beach, for instance, Father 
Fred G. Fotion, holding a lighted candle, will announce, "Come, receive the 
light," and the flame will be spread to candles held by parishioners. The 
congregation will then file outside the church to symbolize Christian missions 
to the world. At many Orthodox churches, the midnight liturgy is lengthy and 
often followed by the exchange of Easter eggs and a fellowship meal. 
</P>
<P>
In Roman Catholic parishes and in many Episcopal churches, Holy Saturday vigil 
services are planned for tonight. Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, 
who will take part in the traditional blessing of the animals at 2 p.m. today 
at the plaza near Olvera Street, also will preside at the 7:30 p.m. Easter 
Vigil at St. Vibiana Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Many Protestant churches have expanded schedules of services Sunday morning, 
and some have sunrise services on their own grounds. Two such outdoor services 
-- in exceptional ocean-view settings -- are scheduled for 6 a.m. at Wayfarers 
Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, a church affiliated with the Swedenborgian 
Church, and for 6:15 a.m. at Malibu Presbyterian Church, 3324 Malibu Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Several interdenominational services for worshipers interested in greeting the 
dawn at 5:34 a.m. also are available. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Bowl service is one of the longest -- from 5:15 to 7 a.m. It will 
parade 13 clergy, several of them of Eastern European heritage, and half a 
dozen choirs off and on the stage. Joining them will be actors Charlton Heston 
and Rhonda Fleming as well as soloists Bob Ralston, former musical director of 
the Lawrence Welk TV program, and 13-year-old flutist Gregory Jefferson, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The 5:30 a.m. service on Mt. Rubidoux, a ridge that is easily reached on paths 
with the help of flashlight-bearing Boy Scouts, features a talk by Norm Nelson, 
speaker for the radio program, "The Morning Chapel Hour," music by the 50-voice 
Ramona High School Choir and solos by Horace Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Sunrise services at four Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks all begin at 5:45 a.m. 
About 2,500 worshipers are expected at the Covina Hills park for the 21st 
annual servicesponsored by the Pomona Valley Council of Churches and two 
ministerial associations. Ted Engstrom, president emeritus of World Vision 
Inc., is the main speaker. Music will be provided by the 100-voice Sanctuary 
Choir and Orchestra of the Covina Assembly of God Church. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 3,000 worshipers will assemble for the service at the Cypress 
cemetery. San Pedro Regional Bishop Carl Fisher of the Los Angeles Catholic 
Archdiocese will give the Easter message. The Rev. James Froede, senior 
minister of Long Beach's Covenant Presbyterian Church, will speak at the Forest 
Lawn Sunnyside service, and the Rev. Bill Miller, pastor of Burbank's Victory 
United Brethren in Christ Church, will speak at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Lawn is not the only cemetery providing a venue for outdoor Easter 
rites. 
</P>
<P>
Clergy of six Whittier area churches will conduct the second annual sunrise 
service, starting at 5:30 a.m., at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. The 
45-voice Long Beach City College Master Work Chorale will sing. The local 
council of churches will receive a special offering at the service to help fund 
a shelter and food program for homeless of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Clergy of Westlake Village churches will begin their annual sunrise service at 
6 a.m. at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park. The Easter message will be 
given by the Rev. Robert C. Bos of Westminster Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
In the resort city of Palm Springs, a community Easter sunrise service will be 
at McDonnell Golf Course starting at 6 a.m. For years sponsored solely by Palm 
Springs Community Church, the service now has ecumenical involvement. The Rev. 
Jeff Rollins, pastor of Ajalon Baptist Church, will speak. 
</P>
<P>
Another annual tradition is the 6 a.m. service at the 400-seat Wagon Camp area 
of Knott's Berry Farm. Worshipers may park free and be admitted to the park for 
that event. The Rev. Doyle Braden of the sponsoring Orange County Southern 
Baptist Assn. will speak. 
</P>
<P>
People who would like to attend an oceanfront service could go to Morro Rock, 
where the annual observance at 6:30 a.m. this year features a message by the 
Rev. W. Norris Barnes of the United Methodist Church, or to Point Loma at the 
Cabrillo National Monument. Navy Chaplain J. James Mowry will speak there 
during a 6:30 a.m. service. Kiwanis Clubs sponsor both the Morro Bay and Point 
Loma services. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the San Diego area are two more services starting at 6:30 a.m.: The 
73rd annual Mt. Helix sunrise service featuring Pastor John Maxwell of Skyline 
Wesleyan Church and a 100-voice choir, as well as the seventh annual, broadly 
sponsored service in Balboa Park at the Spreckel's Organ Pavilion. Bishop 
George D. McKinney of St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ and the combined 
choir from his church will be featured at the Balboa Park service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EASTER 
</P>
<P>
Easter Sunday represents the culmination of Holy Week observances for 
Christians who recall the Gospel stories of Jesus' trial, crucifixion and 
resurrection. Both the Western and Eastern wings of Christianity will celebrate 
the holiday this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: The New Testament declares in various ways the significance for 
Christians of their belief that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. Early 
church practice was to celebrate that belief every Sunday; indeed, the Russian 
word for Sunday is "Resurrection." The Ecumenical Council of Nicea (AD 325) 
established that the special annual celebration should fall after the first day 
of Spring, but also follow Passover on the Jewish calendar. Because of other 
complications, the Eastern and Western calculations of Easter coincide only at 
different intervals. The date coincided this year and in 1987, but will not do 
so again until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: Roman Catholic, Episcopal and Protestant churches will be filled 
with worshipers for Sunday morning Masses and services -- congregations 
supplemented by many Christians who do not attend church on a regular basis. 
Eastern Orthodox Christians will gather for midnight liturgies tonight. Easter 
lilies and brightly colored eggs convey in popular ways the Easter themes of 
new beginnings and renewed hope.

RUMOR OF ATHEIST AIRWAVE ATTACK PERSISTS; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: A FALSE RUMOR THAT MADALYN MURRAY O'HAIR IS PETITIONING THE FCC 
BAN ALL RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING IS 15 YEARS OLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Rumor travels faster, but it don't stay put as long as truth," humorist Will 
Rogers once said. But don't try telling that to the Federal Communications 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A false rumor that atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair is petitioning the FCC to ban 
all religious broadcasting is now 15 years old -- and it still brings in as 
many as 83,000 letters a month to the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
Since the FCC started counting in 1976, more than 23.5 million petitions and 
letters of protest or inquiry about O'Hair have flooded the agency's Washington 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, 1.14 million pieces of mail were sent to Washington and 
monthly totals early this year are running even higher. The still-traveling 
rumor also prompted 3,959 phone calls to the federal agency last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although no current cost estimate is available, FCC officials calculated that 
the commission spent $1.5 million in the first 11 years alone responding to the 
rumor. Its consumer assistance division sends denials to all inquirers, except 
those who mail in form letters. The FCC repeatedly has said it has no legal 
authority to prohibit religious broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fire that is difficult for the FCC to put out," said Audrey Spivack, 
acting chief of the agency's news media division. She would not speculate on 
why the rumor persists. 
</P>
<P>
Most religious observers, and O'Hair herself, say the rumor seems plausible 
because of the atheist's fame as an opponent of religion. A lawsuit by O'Hair 
contributed to the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that banned devotional Bible 
reading in public schools. Her name also is frequently, though wrongly, linked 
to a 1962 Supreme Court ruling that forbade government-mandated prayers in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"To evangelical Christians she is considered perhaps the archenemy of 
religion," said Randall Balmer, a historian of American religion at Columbia 
University. Balmer also noted that the supposed threat from O'Hair would strike 
a blow in one area where conservative Christians have been dominant -- 
religious radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are fearful that the traditional values they hold are 
threatened, and that they must act to defend God," said Thomas McAnally of 
Nashville, national president of the Religious Public Relations Council. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally said the United Methodist news and information office he directs has 
sent out "a half-dozen" releases over 15 years trying to quell the rumor. "The 
alarm that it triggers in them overshadows the need to find out where the 
information comes from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At her American Atheist headquarters in Austin, Tex., O'Hair said she thinks 
"religion has to have an enemy (to succeed). I've been on radio talk programs 
where people say, 'Even if you didn't do it, it sounds like something you would 
do.' They think it's a legitimate way to protest against me." 
</P>
<P>
When Juanita Rayle of Altadena, for example, received a women's club newsletter 
last month with an attached flyer alerting Christians to the alleged threat, 
she said, "I was hopping mad when I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
Rayle went to her church, Pasadena First United Methodist, to run off 100 
copies to distribute to fellow church members and the Altadena Republican 
Women's Club. "Boy, they wanted to do something about that old girl," Rayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors having to do with anti-Christian threats don't stop with O'Hair and the 
FCC. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble has been plagued since 1981 with virulent rumors about its 
supposed satanist influences. Rumors of unknown origin have claimed falsely 
that the company's half-moon and stars trademark is a satanic symbol. Other 
rumors contended, wrongly, that a company executive on a television talk show 
credited his success to "satanic influence." 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble dropped the symbol from its packaging in 1985, got several 
religious leaders to issue disclaimers, and the company filed lawsuits in 1982 
and 1985 against individuals for spreading malicious falsehoods. A new wave of 
rumors coming this year from the South led the Cincinnati-based company to 
reissue an old letter from evangelist Billy Graham reminding Christians that 
"it is a sin to 'bear false witness' " and release a letter written last month 
by Jerry Falwell urging that the rumors be "squelched." 
</P>
<P>
The FCC has not taken such active steps to cut off the O'Hair canard. "We 
respond to requests for interviews by the news media, but we have a small staff 
and no means to do an outreach," said Spivack, the FCC spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Religious publications -- by Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Mormons, Catholics 
and others -- periodically carry articles criticizing the spurious "campaign" 
to the FCC. "Experience has shown that church people contribute many" of the 
protests, said an editorial in the nationally circulated United Methodist 
Reporter. "Let's waste no more effort or postage on it. Instead, let's use our 
energy to identify and confront real evils, to share the Good News of God's 
love with others," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The photocopied O'Hair rumor that appears to be the most commonly circulated 
has some clues to indicate it is unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the notice is unsigned, misspells O'Hair's name and refers 
to her eliminating Bible reading and prayer in schools 15 years ago, which 
suggests the circular was written at least 12 years ago. The notice also 
declares that if O'Hair is successful, then "all Sunday worship services being 
broadcast, either by radio or television, will be stopped" even though 
religious freedom provisions of the First Amendment prohibit such 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
But the urgent tone of the notice still spurs many to action. The notice claims 
that O'Hair has been granted a federal hearing on her petition, which was 
accompanied by 27,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
"We need ONE MILLION (1,000,000) signed petitions," the circular exclaims. 
"This should defeat Mrs. O'Hare by showing that there are still many Christians 
alive, and well, and CONCERNED, in our Country." 
</P>
<P>
Only the petition number cited in the circular -- 2493 -- relates to a real 
case. According to the FCC, a petition by Jeremy D. Lansman and Lorenzo W. 
Milam in December, 1974, was routinely assigned the number RM-2493. That 
petition asked that no licenses be granted for any new, non-commercial 
educational stations, including those of religious educational organizations, 
until their operating practices were examined. That petition was denied by the 
FCC on Aug. 1, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, the rumors had started, saying that RM-2493 called for all 
religious broadcasting to be banned and that O'Hair was behind it. 
</P>
<P>
In the first year it counted them, the FCC received nearly 4.7 million pieces 
of mail on the issue. Subsequently, the volume has fluctuated, falling to a low 
of 546,000 in 1981, but remaining above 1 million letters every year since. 
</P>
<P>
Of 10 letters sent to the FCC early this year and chosen randomly for The Times 
as examples, one was a protest petition from Canada signed by 10 people. The 
other correspondents inquired whether the report was true or not. 
</P>
<P>
One letter writer, the Rev. Jeffrey A. Lambert, pastor of two churches in South 
Shore, Ky., said in an interview, "If it was true, I wanted to get on the 
bandwagon and do everything in my power to fight it." Told by the FCC that the 
rumor was false, Lambert said he distributed copies of the denial to church 
leaders and told members about it from his pulpits. John van Genderen, a member 
of Arcadia First Presbyterian Church, said his wife picked up a circular where 
she works at Caltech. It was one of the copies made by Juanita Rayle. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered seeing something like that several years ago at church, and we 
all signed a petition against it," Van Genderen said. "I thought we were not 
successful, that they required more signatures," he said. He was about to 
present the notice to a social group at his church until someone told him it 
was bogus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RUMOR THAT WON'T DIE 
</P>
<P>
More than 23.5 million letters have flooded the FCC offices in Washington since 
the mid-1970s because a totally false rumor that atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair 
has petitioned to shut down all religious broadcasting. Despite denials by the 
federal agency and disclaimers in the religious press, as many as 83,000 
protests and inquiries arrive monthly at the FCC. Below, the number of letters 
received yearly since 1976.

EASTERN ORTHODOX LEADER WILL VISIT U.S. IN JULY

<P>
His Holiness Dimitrios I, spiritual leader of the world's Eastern Orthodox 
Christians, will tour the United States in July in the first-ever visit to 
North America by the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old patriarch will arrive in Washington from Istanbul on July 2, 
meet with President Bush 10 days later and visit at least eight cities, 
including San Francisco, according to officials of the New York-based Greek 
Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Dimitrios I tentatively is set to visit San Francisco from July 19 to 21, his 
only stop west of the Mississippi, said Nikki Stephanopoulos, information 
director for the archdiocese. "Los Angeles people are trying to get him to stop 
there, too, although the schedule is tight already," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Very Rev. James T. Adams of Los Angeles' St. Sophia Greek Orthodox 
Cathedral said, "We are hoping that His Holiness will be able to visit Los 
Angeles, even if it is a short stopover." 
</P>
<P>
The 269th ecumenical patriarch is the administrative and spiritual leader of 
Greek Orthodox faithful worldwide. In addition, he is regarded historically as 
"first among equals" among the patriarchs of Russian, Ukrainian, 
Carpatho-Russian, Romanian, Albanian, Antiochian, Bulgarian and Serbian 
Orthodox believers. Estimates of Eastern Orthodox faithful around the world 
range between 150 million and 250 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Enthroned as patriarch on July 18, 1972, Dimitrios I limited his travel outside 
of Turkey in his first dozen years to visiting the ancient sees of Christian 
churches in the Middle East. He also received Pope John Paul II in 1979 at his 
small Greek Orthodox enclave in Istanbul (the name given to Constantinople in 
1930). Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim country periodically at odds with 
Greece, had been wary of any sign that the patriarchate was seeking a stronger 
political and diplomatic foothold in the country, analysts have said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dimitrios I has demonstrated over the years that he is "apolitical," said 
Bishop Isaiah, chancellor of the Greek Orthodox archdiocese. Despite the plan 
to meet Bush in Washington, the patriarch "emphasizes on his trips that his 
purpose is to meet with church leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Dimitrios I made his first western trip in December, 1984, traveling to the 
Vatican to meet with the Pope, then to England to meet with the Archbishop of 
Canterbury, Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican churches. 
Then in 1987, he traveled extensively, including the first visit to the Russian 
Orthodox Church by an ecumenical patriarch since the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The patriarch's 11-day stay in Washington is designed to coincide with the 30th 
Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese. Dimitrios I 
will celebrate and preach at the Patriarchal Liturgy on July 8. He will meet 
with Bush at the White House on July 12, followed by a church congress banquet, 
which Bush is expected to attend, Stephanopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
He will visit New York City from July 13-17, with a liturgy at the Cathedral of 
the Holy Trinity; a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel; a luncheon at the 
United Nations; meetings with church leaders, and tours of parishes, an 
orphanage and a school. 
</P>
<P>
He is to meet with Russian Orthodox leaders in Perth Amboy, N.J., on July 17 
and with Ukrainian Orthodox leaders in Allentown, Pa., on July 18. Then he will 
go to San Francisco and Chicago for three days each. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos said he will spend part of July 25 in Buffalo, N.Y., for two 
reasons: "He requested to see Niagara Falls from both sides and will be walking 
across the Peace Bridge. Then, because there are many Orthodox in Canada, it 
will be an opportunity for people from Canada to come see him in Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Buffalo, Dimitrios I will stay in Boston, visiting an Orthodox 
theological school, receiving an honorary degree and meeting Albanian Orthodox 
residents, before returning home on July 29.

WORLD VISION SUES TV STATION, CATHOLIC AGENCY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stung by separate incidents of criticism regarding their financial practices, 
the British and Irish branches of World Vision are taking a British TV network 
and the Irish Catholic Relief Agency to court. 
</P>
<P>
Both incidents, officials of World Vision contend, have undermined the major 
fund-raising effort of the group, which centers on a 24-hour Lenten fast for 
famine-struck people of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
The fast, expected to raise as much as $4.25 million in Britain and $474,000 in 
Ireland, is "the biggest fund-raising event" of the year, according to Phil 
Malone, the press officer for World Vision of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
World Vision of Britain filed a libel action in a London court April 2 against 
Channel 4 and the makers of the TV program "Dispatches," a March 28 documentary 
which accused the charity of spending more money for overhead and proselytizing 
than for relief. 
</P>
<P>
In papers issued April 6, "Trocaire," the Irish Catholic bishops' relief arm, 
is asked to "rescind allegations" made about the "high overhead and 
proselytizing practices" of World Vision of Ireland, said Thora Mackey, a 
spokesperson for the evangelical humanitarian aid organization. 
</P>
<P>
World Vision describes itself "as a leading Christian relief and development 
agency operating in 80 countries. It is non-denominational and has no political 
affiliation." 
</P>
<P>
The legal action was taken after the 24-hour fast in Ireland lost a number of 
sponsors in the wake of the Trocaire criticisms and the Channel 4 documentary, 
according to accounts in the Irish press. 
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of people have pulled out," Ingrid Knapp, director of the Irish 
World Vision body, told the Irish Times. 
</P>
<P>
The legal action was taken "to protect World Vision Ireland's reputation and 
good name," according to an April 4 release by Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
"We have asked them twice to rescind those allegations. As they haven't, we are 
forced to take this legal action," Mackey said. "We don't like doing this, but 
we are left with no alternative. It's interfering with our fund raising and 
work in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Brian McKeown, the director of Trocaire, sent a letter to all Irish bishops 
urging them to inform their people that World Vision uses funds raised in 
Ireland to try to turn Catholics in the Third World from their faith. 
</P>
<P>
The "fundamentalist aims" of World Vision and the Catholic Church are in 
conflict, the letter contends. Reports in the Irish press say Trocaire 
officials accused the charity of timing its fund-raising campaign to cut into 
Trocaire's own Lenten campaign and gearing it to Catholic youth. 
</P>
<P>
Trocaire is "especially concerned that World Vision is actively seeking the 
cooperation of Catholic schools, which are by nature and tradition supporters 
of the church's Lenten campaign," according to a Trocaire spokesman. Especially 
upsetting to the Catholic charity, according to Irish press reports, was that 
"World Vision was approaching Catholic schools without revealing its 
evangelical and fundamentalist origins." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, World Vision leaders were upset because Trocaire's letter 
was "beautifully timed" to coincide with World Vision's fast, according to 
press reports. 
</P>
<P>
A segment of the Dispatches TV series titled "In the Name of Hunger" was 
broadcast March 28 and claimed that less than half the money collected by the 
worldwide evangelical relief organization reached its charitable goal in the 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
"World Vision of Britain made the decision to take legal action with deep 
regret. However, the results of the program could be seriously detrimental for 
World Vision's projects in the Third World," Malone said in a statement 
released April 2. 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raising fast has been held in Britain for five years, "and during that 
time we have built up a great deal of loyalty amongst our supporters. This year 
an estimated 220,000 people had pledged to take part, of whom 80 percent were 
teen-agers. We do not know what will happen," said the executive. 
</P>
<P>
John Swenson, the deputy executive director of Catholic Relief Services in the 
United States, said he was not aware of the legal action taken against 
Trocaire. He described relations between the U.S. bishops' relief arm and World 
Vision U.S. as "cordial."

UKRAINIAN CATHOLICS REGAIN CATHEDRAL

St. George's Cathedral in Lvov has been returned to Ukrainian Catholics after 
being used by the Russian Orthodox Church for more than 40 years, according to 
an announcement by Ukrainian Catholic officials in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement from the temporary see in Rome of the Archeparchy of Lvov said 
the transfer of the cathedral was authorized April 6 by a 124-6 vote of the 
newly elected city council of Lvov. 
</P>
<P>
It said the Orthodox Church was told to vacate the cathedral and its entire 
complex of buildings by last Thursday and to relocate to the Latin-rite Church 
of St. Nicholas in Lvov. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a joyous day for the Ukrainian Catholic Church," said Cardinal 
Myroslav Lubachivsky, who has headed the worldwide Ukrainian Catholic community 
from Rome since 1985. "Our prayers have been answered, and we thank God for his 
mercy upon our people." 
</P>
<P>
The Cathedral of St. George was built between 1744 and 1770 on the site of an 
earlier church. The bell of the older church, which was cast in 1341 and is the 
oldest in the Ukraine, remains in the cathedral's bell tower. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Catholic Church, also known as the Uniate Church, was forcibly 
disbanded under Stalin in 1946. Last October, Ukrainian Catholics took over the 
Transfiguration Cathedral in Lvov in what Russian Orthodox leaders said was a 
violent seizure, but Ukrainian Catholics described it as a change that was 
agreed upon by the cathedral congregation.

The Rev. Marvin Abrams, a Seneca Indian and a United Methodist pastor, will 
begin a 200-mile walk Monday from Santa Barbara to San Diego as a way to call 
attention to his denomination's newest special offering day -- Native American 
Sunday on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it a 'Seventh Generation Walk' (because) in the Seneca nation we make 
decisions based upon what they will cause in seven generations to come," Abrams 
said. He is pastor of the Native American United Methodist Church in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
United Methodist Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles said he would join Abrams 
on parts of his walk. The itinerary, mostly along Pacific Coast Highway, 
includes stops at Methodist churches at Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Northridge, 
Santa Monica and California Heights in Long Beach. Abrams will be driven from 
the coast and back in order to make speaking appearances at the inland 
churches. "I've been walking every day" to get in shape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the second leg, from Norwalk to San Diego, were not available this 
week, but Abrams said he would end the jaunt with an evening powwow April 22 at 
the Norwalk church. 
</P>
<P>
Donations received on Native American Sunday -- the last Sunday this month -- 
will support Native American ministries, scholarships for Indian seminarians 
and six urban ministries that help Indians.

Father George Stallings, suspended as a Catholic priest last year after he 
established his independent Imani Temple in Washington, is scheduled to speak 
at two churches in Los Angeles next week. Stallings will talk Wednesday at 
Faith United Methodist Church, 1713 W. 108th St., during a 7 p.m. revival, and 
Thursday at First African Methodist Episcopal Church, 2270 S. Harvard Blvd., at 
a 7 p.m. service. At the annual conference last month in New Jersey of the 
National Assn. of Black Seminarians, Stallings said African-Americans must 
"redefine, reclaim and reconstruct our history as well as our theological 
foundations." The Rev. M.A. Robinson-Gaither, pastor of Faith United Methodist, 
said Stallings "has given fiber" to renewed desire among young black Christians 
to reassert their perspective on church life. "We might be seeing the '60s all 
over again, but with a different approach," Robinson-Gaither said.

Father Terrance Fleming, vice chancellor of the Los Angeles Catholic 
Archdiocese and a key organizer of preparations in 1987 for the Los Angeles 
visit of Pope John Paul II, was named by Archbishop Roger M. Mahony this week 
as pastor of St. Vibiana Cathedral, effective next month. The assignment moves 
Fleming into a position often favorable for subsequent appointment to the 
Catholic hierarchy. Three former pastors who later became bishops were Alden 
Bell, William Johnson and John Steinbock. Msgr. Royale Vadakin, appointed as 
cathedral pastor six years ago by the late Cardinal Timothy Manning, will 
remain director of the archdiocese's highly praised ecumenical and interfaith 
programs. He will receive an honorary doctorate on May 12 from Loyola Marymount 
University. On May 18, Vadakin will assume new duties as pastor of St. 
Anastasia parish in Westchester.

before becoming a campus minister at Cal State Los Angeles. A member for 26 
years of the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Towler also established 
four years ago the Dan Towler Educational Foundation, a trust that has awarded

MEASLES OUTBREAK PLAGUES 23 STATES; FUNDS RUN SHORT 
</P>

<P>
The measles outbreak now plaguing California is part of a larger, two-year 
epidemic that health officials say is sweeping the nation, causing thousands of 
cases of illness and scores of deaths. 
</P>
<P>
From Maine to Texas, Alaska to Florida, there have been measles outbreaks in at 
least 23 states this year, and the number of reported cases is running 70% 
ahead of last year at this time, health officials said. For 1989, the Centers 
for Disease Control in Atlanta reported 17,800 measles cases and 45 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
By April 6 this year, at least 31 measles-related deaths had been reported 
nationally, two in Orange County and 24 in all of California. And the "measles 
season" of late winter and early spring, is not yet over, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
State after state has turned to the Centers for Disease Control for additional 
money for vaccine to immunize vulnerable populations. Consequently, $9.5 
million in special federal funds allotted this year for outbreak control is 
already gone, CDC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent the last of the money out today," Dr. William Atkinson, a CDC 
epidemiologist who has been monitoring the nation's measles outbreak, said 
Thursday. "We've asked the government for a supplemental appropriation. Until 
we get it, people will just have to wait or they will have to go to their state 
Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Most states say they have adequate supplies of vaccine on hand. But, they said, 
they are being cautious with their remaining stores. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we're running nip and tuck, kind of hand to mouth in order to 
immunize all the people who need to be immunized," said B. J. Laing, a nursing 
consultant for the Nevada Department of Social and Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got enough at the moment for outbreak control," said Dr. Mack Sewell, 
New Mexico state epidemiologist, "but we're being very judicious about how we 
use it. We have to be careful because of the limited supply and the amount of 
funds we have." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Nelson, a public health adviser in Washington, said he is keeping his 
fingers crossed that Merck, Sharp &amp; Dome, the only federally approved 
manufacturer of measles vaccine, can keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
"The worse case scenario is that we may be two or three days in getting the 
vaccine into the areas," said Gary Bruell, spokesman for the West Point, Pa., 
company. "But we're getting it there as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of measles cases in Orange County is already outstripping 
last year's. By Friday, 141 residents had been infected so far this year, 
compared to 95 cases by the same date last year. The cases are mounting so fast 
that county epidemiologist Dr. Thomas A. Prendergast -- who in early January 
had hoped the epidemic was waning -- now gloomily believes that no end is in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the nation's outbreak has been concentrated among preschool 
children, either because parents failed to have them vaccinated against the 
disease or because they contracted the disease before the recommended 
immunization age of 12 months, officials said. Both Orange County children who 
died this winter -- a 7-month-old Santa Ana boy and a 10-month-old Anaheim girl 
whose measles led to pneumonia and then encephalitis -- were too young to have 
been vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, an estimated 30% of preschoolers have not been vaccinated, 
officials said, and Atkinson of the CDC believes those numbers are probably 
reflective of other major urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), has introduced legislation for a 40% 
increase in the $131.5 million allotted to the CDC to be distributed to states 
for immunization. 
</P>
<P>
"We should eliminate any financial barriers and second we should reach out to 
bring people in to have their children immunized. It's inexcusable that we 
should have people suffering." Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
For most communities, the biggest problem is providing enough staff as health 
officials struggle to identify affected pockets and to vaccinate susceptible 
residents. In Washington state, local health departments in some cases have 
recruited Boy Scout troops to go door to door handing out flyers urging that 
residents be immunized. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Paul, Minn., which has had 117 reported measles cases since January, 
compared to seven cases for all of last year, department officials have been 
forced to pull staff from other departments, hire additional workers, recruit 
volunteers and enlist the services of a home health care agency to meet the 
demand for immunization. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had this type of an outbreak in recent years," said epidemiologist 
Dr. Paula Henry." 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, which has already reported 1,600 cases of measles, five times last 
year's number, and four deaths, health department officials have been working 
almost around the clock, said county epidemiologist Charles Haley. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to drive our staff past any reasonable limits," Haley said. "In the 
month of February, we immunized more people than we did in all of 1989, and in 
the first 10 days of March, we immunized more than we did in February. And 
that's with no additional staff." 
</P>
<P>
While the current outbreak pales in comparison to the pre-vaccine era when 
measles cases numbered 500,000 to a million annually, health officials say they 
are concerned because of the highly contagious nature of the disease in what 
has become a more mobile national population. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to even be in the same room to get the disease," said Atkinson 
of CDC. "We know that an infected person can have left a room two hours ago, 
and you can walk into the room and catch the disease from the germs still 
floating around in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Officials have tracked cases that were passed on county-to-county and 
state-to-state via crowds in medical waiting rooms, at spring break and at 
weddings and other family gatherings. Health officials say many cases can be 
traced to Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua and El Salvador. More than 300 
measles-related deaths were recorded in Mexico alone last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say one reason that many young children have not been immunized is 
that the health care system has sometimes not made immunization easily 
accessible. Consequently, many communities are now considering changes in 
location of their clinics or the hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
But officials also warn that it is parents who ultimately are responsible for 
seeing that their children are immunized. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one death where the parent lives six blocks from an immunization 
clinic," said Haley in Dallas. "That wasn't a problem of accessibility." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen-month-old children don't walk into the clinic," Atkinson added. "They 
have to be brought in." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials said part of the problem has been the inability of the health 
care system to educate many people, particularly recent immigrants, to the 
importance of immunization. That, they said, accounts for the disproportionate 
number of measles cases in Latino, non-English-speaking populations and other 
immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We've polled people in our Hispanic community, and it's an accepted thing in 
childhood that everyone gets the measles," said Laing of the Arizona Health 
Department. "It's a way of life, an expected happening. We're trying to reach 
them through the media to let them know that we do have some prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials report a similar situation in Minnesota, where the Laotian 
immigrants settled near St. Paul and Minneapolis following the Vietnam War, and 
in the Amish communities scattered throughout Iowa, New York, Michigan and 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a couple of hundred cases simply because the Amish people don't 
believe in immunization," said William Fagel, spokesperson for the New York 
Health Department. "Once it starts in a closed community like that, it spreads 
like wildfire." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the outbreak, officials said, are a large number of measles 
infections in adults who have been vaccinated. Officials said that in about 5% 
of all those vaccinated against measles, the vaccination fails to take hold, or 
sometimes the protection wanes over time. That has accounted for large 
outbreaks of measles around the country in colleges and universities among 
young adults, who are most susceptible to the deadlier aspects of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Academy of 
Pediatrics has recommended to public and private health providers that those 
born after 1956, particularly school children, college students, medical 
personnel and those in high-risk locations, be vaccinated at least twice to be 
sure that the vaccine takes hold.

GORBACHEV DOCUMENTS SOVIET GUILT AT KATYN

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, seeking to defuse the single biggest issue 
poisoning relations between the Soviet Union and neighboring Poland, gave 
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski documents Friday that showed that Soviet 
secret police killed thousands of Polish army officers during World War II and 
buried them in mass graves in a Russian forest. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic admission from the Kremlin, accompanied by an expression of regret 
for what an official statement called "one of the gravest crimes of Stalinism," 
was a clear effort by Gorbachev to shore up relations with a key Warsaw Pact 
nation as East Germany and other socialist countries drift further westward. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow, in a statement carried by the official news agency Tass, reversed 
almost half a century of denials in admitting that its secret police had killed 
4,000 soldiers whose bodies were found in 1940 in the Katyn Forest near 
Smolensk, southwest of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass statement added that another 11,000 Polish soldiers disappeared, but 
did not detail their fate. Historians, however, believe they also were 
massacred. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were among about 130,000 Polish soldiers who were in the part of 
prewar Poland taken over by Moscow in 1939 as part of a nonaggression pact 
between Soviet leader Josef Stalin and Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin apparently ordered some of the troops killed because he feared that they 
"might in the future enter the struggle for their country's rebirth," according 
to Soviet historian Natalya Lebedeva, whose views were published last month in 
the progressive weekly Moscow News. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis later occupied the area around Katyn and in 1942 revealed the 
discovery of the mass graves. After trying to pass it off as a medieval burial 
site, the Soviet Union contended that the Poles had been shot by German troops 
in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
When Poland's government in exile in London demanded more evidence, Stalin 
angrily broke off ties with what he described as a "hostile" Polish leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Western countries largely ignored the massacre or accepted 
Stalin's version of events. But by the 1950s, Western historians were blaming 
the Soviets for the killings. Moscow continued to deny that it had any role in 
the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski and Gorbachev agreed in 1987 to set up a commission to study World 
War II events at Katyn. In November, Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, 
after a visit to Katyn, demanded "moral compensation" for those who died. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's meeting, Gorbachev gave Jaruzelski copies of documents from Soviet 
archives, which reportedly were only recently discovered and which dealt with 
Polish soldiers held in Soviet prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
Tass did not report further details of the meeting, but Jaruzelski said earlier 
this week that he expected the two leaders would discuss the reunification of 
Germany and the future of Soviet troops on Polish soil. Jaruzelski is to visit 
Katyn today. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Katyn damaged relations between Poland and the Soviet Union 
for decades. There had been speculation that Gorbachev would discuss the Katyn 
incident during his official visit to Poland last year, but he avoided the 
topic. By choosing to reveal the guilt of Soviet secret police now, Gorbachev 
was making an obvious overture to Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is seriously concerned about the future of the Warsaw Pact, particularly 
as East Germany's new leaders have indicated they would support a united 
Germany's becoming a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if the 
Western Alliance establishes an all-European strategic system. The Soviet Union 
has repeatedly said it finds that proposal unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was seeking to demonstrate once again that he and his government are 
vastly different from any previous Soviet leaders. It was not immediately 
clear, however, how much good the Soviet admission would accomplish in Poland, 
where perceptions of Moscow are colored, perhaps irreversibly, by years of 
false denials regarding Katyn. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the 11,000 Polish officers whose fates were not detailed by the 
Soviet statement, for instance, have long demanded and are still seeking a full 
explanation of what happened to the troops. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's admission also answers growing calls in this country for greater 
Soviet forthrightness on the issue. On Sunday, for instance, the Medecinskaya 
Gazeta called for publication of official medical reports regarding the Katyn 
killings, contending that most of the victims were killed with a bullet in the 
back of the neck and some bore wounds produced by Soviet-made bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his effort at glasnost, or greater openness, Gorbachev has sought to 
fill in the so-called blank spaces in Soviet history and particularly to 
publicly reveal the crimes of Stalin, whose bloody period of dictatorship is 
referred to here euphemistically as the "Cult of the Personality." 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin statement clearly blamed the massacre on Stalin and his NKVD, the 
brutal forerunner of the modern KGB secret police. It singled out by name NKVD 
Chief Lavrenti Beria and his protege V. N. Merkulov. 
</P>
<P>
"Just recently, Soviet archive workers and historians discovered some documents 
concerning Polish servicemen," the Soviet statement said. "It follows from 
these documents that in April-May, 1940, 394 of the 15,000 or so Polish 
officers kept in the three camps (in Kozelsk, Starobelsk and Ostashkov) were 
transferred to the Gryazovetsk camp" in northern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"The larger part, however, were turned over to the NKVD administrations . . . 
and never mentioned in NKVD statistical accounts again."

Inside the home of Danute Mazeika, a facsimile machine sending documents to 
Eastern Europe hums noisely amid the din of children playing and the telephone 
ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Mazeika answers the phone with a curt "hello." Then, when she recognizes the 
caller's voice, she informs him of the events taking place in Lithuania 
thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a report that soldiers from Moscow are in tanks driving in Vilnius and 
damaging buildings, street lights and everything," Mazeika says. "And we hear 
that the thugs are out in force." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Baltic HQ, the Mazeika residence, which up until recently was a 
typical home for a family of five. But increased tensions between the Soviet 
Union and nationalists in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia have transformed the 
Mazeika home into the Southern California hub of information, linking thousands 
of Baltic-Americans to events taking place in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their relatively small numbers, the Baltic-Americans represent a highly 
vocal community. Both Mazeika and her husband, Anthony, were born in the United 
States. But she is a distant cousin of Lithuania's president and granddaughter 
of one of the signers of its 1918 independence pact. Her husband, who has a 
real estate business in Mission Viejo, has distant relatives in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
They both are co-founders of the Baltic American Freedom League, one of several 
Eastern European ethnic organizations that met with President Bush and his top 
advisers this week. Anthony Mazeika, who is considered one of this country's 
leading spokesmen on Baltic issues, was a member of the 14-person delegation 
that met with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, this is a pretty average household," said Danute Mazeika, a mother of 
three. "I had to deport my three kids to another home while my husband was in 
Washington. I mean, it got crazy around here." 
</P>
<P>
The one positive aspect that has emerged as events in Eastern Europe unfold, 
she said, is that Orange County Baltic-Americans "have come out of the 
woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast with other ethnic groups, the Lithuanian community is not large. 
There are an estimated 20,000 residents of Lithuanian descent in Southern 
California. While the majority live in Los Angeles, a number of the leaders are 
in Orange County, where they and other Baltic-Americans number about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County businessman Richard Kontrimas, a Lithuanian-American who also 
lives in Mission Viejo, recently accompanied Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach) as an interpreter during the congressman's observation of elections in 
Lithuania in February. 
</P>
<P>
Kontrimas said Lithuanians have found strong support from Cox and other elected 
officials, but not from President Bush. "Despite meeting with Baltic-Americans 
in Washington who asked for him to take stronger action, we still don't have a 
clue as to what Bush is going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Danute Mazeika said that since the declaration of independence in Lithuania 
more than a month ago, she has put aside her at-home art business. Her 
husband's real estate business also has taken a back seat to more pressing 
events taking place in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For the Mission Viejo couple, it was an easy decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an ethnic issue," Anthony Mazeika said. ". . . There's a much greater 
issue here. When we formed the freedom league in 1981, we felt that it was time 
to have a nationwide grass-roots effort to champion freedom of the Baltic 
region. We're busy giving information, developing American consensus and trying 
to develop a favorable policy in the Bush Administration towards the Baltic 
states." 
</P>
<P>
The Mazeikas are well-versed on political causes. In 1983, Anthony Mazeika and 
other Baltic-Americans organized a "Ban the Soviets" movement aimed at 
eliminating Russian athletes from participating in the 1984 Olympics in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I was nine months pregnant when Tony came in and said, 'Honey, 
we're going to ban the Soviets from the Olympics,' " Danute Mazeika said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she doubted her husband's goal then but has since gone toe-to-toe with 
Soviet propaganda officials. At a recent speech by a Soviet official at UC San 
Diego, the official refused to answer Mazeika's tough questions on Lithuania. 
But she was undaunted. When she was asked to sit down, she refused. When they 
went to another speaker, she fumed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a housewife out of Mission Viejo going up against somebody from Russia. 
Why should they be afraid to answer me?" 
</P>
<P>
She said she believes that a lot of Americans are being taken in by the 
openness of the Soviet Union under glasnost. She warned, "You cannot turn your 
back on the dancing bear."

CHILD REPORTS SHOTS THAT KILLED PARENTS

An 8-year-old boy, awakened by gunfire, discovered his mother bleeding from the 
head, called police and ran outside. Police said they later found both the 
bodies of both his parents in their bedroom Friday morning, apparently the 
victims of a murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The child called 911 at 11:34 p.m. to report his mother's injury, said Orange 
Police Sgt. Bob Gustafson. When police arrived two minutes later, the child ran 
out of the apartment and officers sealed off the area. 
</P>
<P>
For nine hours, they tried to contact the father. Finally, they stormed the 
upstairs apartment about 9:15 a.m. and discovered the body of Larry Eugene 
Wardlow, 38, and his wife, Elva Figueroa Wardlow, 32. 
</P>
<P>
After brief questioning, the 8-year-old was taken to the Orangewood Children's 
Home where he is being held in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he could see his mother bleeding from her face and it looks like she 
was shot in the head," Gustafson said. "He said his dad was still in the 
apartment and that he could see him rolling on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said police discovered Larry Wardlow's body on the bedroom floor. His 
wife was stretched out on their bed. A .38-caliber revolver believed to be the 
murder weapon was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said investigators believe that Larry Wardlow killed himself moments 
after he fatally shot his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Since last August, officers had gone to the Wardlows' home in the 700 block of 
North Kathleen Street three times to investigate domestic disturbances, 
Gustafson said. The most recent call was several days ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the couple moved into the apartment building last August. Larry 
Wardlow worked as a supervisor in a Santa Ana machine shop, while his wife 
worked for a Costa Mesa packaging company, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrie Egkan, who lives in an adjacent apartment, said Elva Wardlow summoned 
police several months ago after Larry threw a knife at their son, James. 
</P>
<P>
Then, "they had another dispute . . . and Elva and James had left for a long 
time," Egkan said. "But a few days ago, I saw they were bringing back Elva's 
stuff into the house." 
</P>
<P>
Egkan said she recently warned Elva Wardlow that her husband had threatened to 
kill her. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a nice woman. . . . I wished she had listened to me and left," Egkan 
said, burying her face in her hands. "But she kept saying that Larry had 
changed, and that she was going to make their marriage work for James." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors gathered outside the building Friday to talk about the tragedy and 
the night's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Jude Nichol, 47, said she returned home about midnight and discovered that 
police had sealed off her street and evacuated the Wardlow's building and the 
four-plexes on either side. Nichol said she spent the night trying 
unsuccessfully to sleep in her car. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of her apartment, Nichol looked on as an Orange detective 
discovered a shoulder holster in Larry Wardlow's beige Datsun pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking her head, she said: "It's awful. He had no right to kill his wife . . . 
and the little boy saw something he should not have seen. That's awful because 
he is going to live with that for the rest of his life."

INDIANS WIN ACCESS TO ARCHEOLOGY DIGS

<P>
Irvine Co. officials assured a group of local Indians on Friday that they will 
have a new role in monitoring future archeological digs at the Newport Coast 
development between Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
But company officials refused a request to change their policy of digging up 
ancestral Indian remains and burying them in areas that are earmarked for open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything according to state law," said project director Bernard 
A. Maniscalco. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Gabrieleno Indian tribe, whose territory once stretched from the 
coast to the San Gabriel Mountains, have accused the Irvine Co. of desecrating 
the burial grounds of their ancestors and destroying ancient artifacts during 
construction work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," said tribal chairwoman Vera Rocha, who spent Friday morning 
inspecting a variety of archeological digs in the sage-covered hill country. 
"They have no respect for our people." 
</P>
<P>
Rocha and others had planned to picket the Irvine Co. headquarters on Friday to 
press company officials for access to the dig sites. They wanted to check out a 
complaint that bones unearthed by a backhoe had been carelessly tossed aside. 
</P>
<P>
But the picketing was not necessary. After a last-minute round of negotiations, 
Irvine Co. officials agreed to escort the Indians to various digs, where they 
watched teams of archeologists and field workers catalogue shells and animal 
bones and inspect hillside caves for signs of human habitation. 
</P>
<P>
The handful of Gabrielenos who went on the tour were accompanied by David 
Belardes, chief of the San Juan Capistrano-based Juaneno Indian tribe, and 
several local environmentalists, who criticized the company for building on 
land considered sacred by the Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
After the tour, the Irvine Co. agreed to allow Rocha or her representative to 
monitor future digs. They also agreed to consider turning over some of the 
artifacts to Rocha. Currently, they are given to the Natural History and 
Science Foundation of Orange County, which plans to open a museum in Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha said that the company has violated the state Historic Sites Preservation 
Act of 1966 by failing to notify her or other members of her tribe of the 
various finds. 
</P>
<P>
According to the law, companies that unearth artifacts or human remains must 
notify a tribal member. The human remains must either be turned over to a 
descendant or reburied within the project site. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco said that the company has contracted with Jim Velasques to monitor 
archeological activity. Velasques is a registered Gabrieleno with the state 
Native American Heritage Commission and the U.S. Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha has long refused to recognize Velasques as a member of the tribe. She 
also questioned whether there is a conflict of interest because Velasques is on 
the Irvine Co. payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco said the tour "went as good as you can expect." He agreed to 
investigate the charges that a backhoe operator mishandled human remains. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha said she will continue to demand that human bones be left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they won't go to Greece and tear up their dead," Rocha said. "They 
should have the same respect for our culture, our heritage." JAMES M. GOMEZ

CONDEMNED HOMES NEED NEW LOCATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 35 condemned homes in Costa Mesa that the county had hoped to use for 
low-income housing may be demolished if officials cannot find a place to store 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the houses could be decided Monday, when Anaheim city officials 
consider a county request to store the structures on a one-time waste-hauling 
site near Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
County officials had planned to start today on the task of relocating the 
houses, which are being removed to make way for a $25-million road widening 
project along a 1 1/2-mile strip of Victoria Street. 
</P>
<P>
The houses were originally supposed to be relocated to a 15-acre parcel at the 
intersection of Grand and McFadden avenues in Santa Ana. But police concerns 
that the houses would provide a haven for criminals and vagrants quashed plans 
for the site, which is owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the county turned to Anaheim for help. Officials from Anaheim and 
the county plan to inspect the lot near the stadium Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If Anaheim rejects the proposal, "very likely the opportunity (to save the 
homes) will be lost," said Rick Ekfer, who supervises new housing development 
at the county's Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
If the county fails to secure the site at Anaheim Stadium, the county would 
still be able to save three or four homes, Ekfer added. Many of the rest could 
go to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
People who want the homes, however, "would have to be able to move them on 
short order," said Bill Morris, Costa Mesa's community service director. LEON

<P>
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASS GETS IN FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a typical kindergarten class, "cut" usually is the signal to begin creating 
paper dolls, and mastering "colorization" means guiding a blue-green Crayola 
within the lines. 
</P>
<P>
But at Mitchell Elementary School in Garden Grove, those terms take on a very 
different meaning. At an age when most kids are making mud pies, students there 
are making movies. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters have piled up local, regional and even international honors for 
their work. But teachers say the biggest benefit is the improved self-esteem of 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen yourself on video? It's not that big a thrill for adults, 
but for a child to see themselves . . . ," said Jeanne Cassesso, one of three 
kindergarten teachers involved in the project. "By the end of the year, they 
gain confidence. They learn by looking at themselves. If a kid's standing there 
with his finger in his ear, pretty soon he learns that's not such a neat 
trait." 
</P>
<P>
The school's first film project was 20 years ago when kindergarten teacher 
Marlene McConville took out a Super-8 camera and recorded "Snow White" to lure 
parents to back-to-school night. McConville and another teacher, Patricia 
Purcell, decided to start a film program after that night. 
</P>
<P>
The film work is "above and beyond" regular classroom work, and teachers donate 
time and money toward the project. They also provide many of the technical 
skills, including camera work and editing, but students write the scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"We start with brainstorming ideas," McConville said. "For instance, once we 
brought in a bunch of hats, and the kids could pick any hat and then tell what 
they would do if, for instance, they had a policeman's hat. It's from this that 
we glean our stories." 
</P>
<P>
One video, "Kaleidoscope of Dreams," began with the study of colors and ended 
up winning third prize in the drama category of the International Student Media 
Festival held in February in Anaheim. Another Mitchell production, "Hocus 
Pocus," won first place in the comedy division for its tongue-in-cheek magic 
tricks. 
</P>
<P>
The "Mitchell Stars," as the 90 or so kindergarten students involved are 
called, have also won $4,500 in community service grants from Disneyland and a 
1982 award from Filmex, Los Angeles' international film exposition. JAMES

<P>
DOCTOR LOSES BID TO REGAIN HIS LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A judge refused Friday to reinstate a doctor's medical license that had been 
revoked by state officials after he treated up to 6,000 allergy patients, 
including those at an Anaheim clinic, by injecting them with their own urine. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski denied an appeal by Dr. 
George R. Borrell to overturn a Dec. 4 cancellation of his license by the 
Medical Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
Borrell, 69, operates clinics in Canoga Park and Anaheim under the name Allergy 
Control Medical Group. 
</P>
<P>
State medical authorities said Borrell's urine injections constituted an 
"extreme departure" from proper medical care. They said Borrell, who attended a 
military medical school in Mexico but was described as a "self-taught" 
allergist, also exhibited a "shocking and extreme" lack of medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Borrell could not be reached for comment Friday. But in previous interviews, he 
has defended his urine injections as a safe and effective "folk remedy" that 
has been practiced for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
While urine treatment sounds "kind of preposterous or ugly or dirty," it had 
helped numerous allergy sufferers, Borrell said. 
</P>
<P>
But state medical officials labeled urine injections as quackery, and said they 
can lead to infection, kidney failure, breathing difficulties and death. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski said his decision was based not on "either tolerance or repugnance 
for the concept of urine injections" but on a lack of legal evidence that 
Borrell's license was improperly revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Borrell's lawyer, Herbert Selwyn, said Zebrowski and state medical officials 
had "already made their minds up" about taking away Borrell's license after 
first hearing of his treatments. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Earl Plowman said the license revocation means Borrell 
will have to either sell or close his two clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last December, Borrell said he injected 5,000 to 
6,000 allergy patients with their own urine over a 12-year period. He said only 
two or three of them developed infections from the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
State officials acknowledged they knew of no patients who died or required 
hospitalization as a result of urine therapy and that they received only one 
complaint about Borrell. 
</P>
<P>
But they said many of Borrell's patients were chronic sufferers desperate to 
believe that his unusual therapy was helping them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we've seen again and again and again in quack cases," 
Plowman said. "There's a lot of people out there who are deathly afraid of 
institutionalized medicine, who are looking for quick cures." JACK CHEEVERS

STOCK CONFLICTS ADMITTED BY SAN CLEMENTE PLANNER; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: HAROLD JOSEPH SAYS HE HELD SHARES IN A COMPANY THAT BENEFITED FROM 
HIS VOTE ON A HOUSING PROJECT. 'I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ILLEGAL,' HE SAYS.

<P>
A city planning commissioner acknowledged Friday that he held stock in a land 
development company at the same time that he voted in favor of plans for three 
San Clemente housing projects owned by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Harold Joseph said he sold the stock last month when City 
Clerk Myrna Erway reviewed his state-required financial disclosure statement 
and pointed out the apparent conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold it the same day," said Joseph, who owns a real estate firm in San 
Clemente with his wife, Mary. "I didn't know it was illegal. There was never 
any intent to do anything irregular." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph held more than $10,000 in Centex Development Corp. stock when he joined 
a 5-0 vote by the Planning Commission in November to approve the three 
subdivisions, which will total 476 single-family homes and condominiums when 
built. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits appointed and elected officials from voting on issues in 
which they have a financial interest, said Jeevan Singh Ahuja, senior attorney 
for the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The state could levy fines of up to $2,000 per infraction, and civil and 
misdemeanor criminal penalties could also be imposed, the FPPC attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph has been involved with Centex since 1988, when he acknowledged to city 
officials that he helped steer the development company toward property in east 
San Clemente. The Texas-based development company is building 398 homes on the 
Forster Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
Although the planning commissioner received a finder's fee of more than 
$10,000, the city attorney ruled that Joseph had done nothing wrong because he 
was paid the commission by Estrella Properties Ltd., the firm from which Centex 
bought the Forster Ranch site. In addition, Joseph has abstained from voting on 
the Forster Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the City Council subsequently passed an ordinance requiring 
immediate disclosure of any conflict of interest from city employees, which 
strengthened state requirements that a conflict be reported within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said he and his wife invested in Centex in April, 1989, "because it was 
a fun thing to do. This whole thing had been swirling around, and then it was 
over and I said, 'Gee Mary, let's go out and buy some of this, it would be 
fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, "it was bad judgment on my part," Joseph admitted. "I certainly 
didn't mean to break any laws." 
</P>
<P>
Three of four council members contacted said they would not vote to renew 
Joseph's two-year term as commissioner when it expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Brian J. Rice said Joseph is "using every loophole he can find to 
remain on the Planning Commission. It's pretty sad when the city clerk has to 
point out the problems here." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Candace Haggard said, "There are so many qualified people who can do this 
job, if there is any hint of impropriety we should let someone else do the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Scott Diehl said the stock purchase "was not very prudent," but he 
also said Joseph has never shown any indications of being influenced by a 
developer.

One of two girls pulled from a back-yard swimming pool Wednesday was released 
from the hospital Friday, but her comatose sister remained in critical 
condition with little hope of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Three-year-old Robyn Newkirk left St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center 
Friday with her parents, three days after she was pulled out of her 
grandmother's pool in Fullerton, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers revived Robyn and her 5-year-old sister, Randi, who was found on the 
bottom of the pool. Randi, who is breathing with the help of a respirator, 
remains in critical condition at Childrens Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Clint Walker, the family's pastor, said the parents are "holding up real well 
for what they are going through." 
</P>
<P>
He said the family has received an outpouring of support from family and 
friends throughout the country. "People they don't even know have been calling 
to say their prayers are with them," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
The parents declined to talk about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now they are concerned about Randi's condition," he said. "In the next 
few days, things should become more clear."

DROWNED WOMAN HAD DIED 2 HOURS BEFORE BODY FOUND

<P>
A 36-year-old woman found at the bottom of a back-yard swimming pool Thursday 
had been dead for about two hours before a neighbor discovered her body, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A 2-year-old boy, who was secure in a floating ring, was in the pool at the 
time Martha Munoz-Lemus drowned, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's cries drew the attention of a neighbor, who looked over the fence and 
saw Munoz-Lemus on the bottom of the pool behind the two-story residence in the 
25000 block of Owens Lake Circle in El Toro. The neighbor called 911. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy revealed that Munoz-Lemus of Mexico died about 4 p.m. Thursday, more 
than two hours before paramedics were called. She was found wearing a shirt and 
shorts, not swimming attire, a coroner's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators consider the case closed. "As far as we're concerned, 
it's a nonsuspicious death," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Burnett, the owner of the house, said Munoz-Lemus was a friend of the 
family who occasionally cared for his 2-year-old son.

Billy Bardens doubled in a run and scored another to lead UC Irvine to a 3-1 
victory over University of the Pacific in a Big West Conference baseball game 
Friday at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters managed only one hit in four innings off starter Jim Yanko, who 
faced the minimum when Chris Gallego was caught stealing after his first-inning 
single. 
</P>
<P>
But Fred Combs led off the fifth with a single, and one out later, Bardens 
lined his RBI double to the wall in left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't hit too many long balls," Bardens said. "I was hoping that it just 
would fall (in for a hit). I guess I was hoping it would go out, too." 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Bardens scored to give Irvine a 2-1 lead on John Skaggs' triple 
up the alley in right. But Ed Luna flied deep to center to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific (13-25, 0-5 in conference) scored in the third inning on Doug Welpot's 
two-out solo homer to center. The home run served as a wake-up call for the 
Anteaters, who still seemed sluggish after being swept in a three-game series 
at Fresno State last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
David Bladow (5-3) finished with a four-hitter, striking out nine and walking 
one, for Irvine (25-17, 3-5). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any stuff," Bladow said. "My split (finger fastball) wasn't 
working at first. But right after the home run, I started to feel more in 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine scored another run in the eighth. Dan Roberson singled, stole second and 
took third when catcher Curt Wright's throw went into the outfield. Roberson 
scored on Luna's sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
In California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball:

UC Riverside 11, Chapman 9 (11 innings) -- Chad Townsend hit a two-run home run 
in the 11th for first-place Riverside (29-10, 13-6) at Hart Park in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Klopfer had four hits and two RBIs, Jason Rolish had two hits and two RBIs, 
and Tom Allison had three hits and scored twice for second-place Chapman 
(23-14, 13-6).

POPOFF FANS 10 AS TITANS WIN, 5-2

<TEXT>
<P>
As Cal State Fullerton's James Popoff lulled Fresno State to sleep with his 
offspeed pitches, Phil Nevin provided an offensive wake-up call that helped 
propel the Titans to a 5-2 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 300 at Titan Field saw Popoff, a sophomore right-hander from 
Whittier, pitch a four-hitter and strike out 10 as the Titans won their second 
in a row over the Bulldogs and improved to 20-16 overall, 4-1 in the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin, a freshman third baseman from El Dorado High School, provided the 
offensive spark when he led off the fourth inning with a home run off 
right-hander Eric Schullstrom, who had retired the first nine batters, five of 
them on strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin's homer to left-center field tied the score at 1-1, and Fullerton broke 
it open in the fifth with a two-out, four-run rally highlighted by Mate 
Borgogno's three-run double. 
</P>
<P>
The victory brought the Titans to within a half-game of first-place Fresno 
State (27-13, 6-2 and ranked 18th in the Baseball America poll). Fullerton, 
which has hovered around the .500 mark all season, can move into first with a 
victory in today's 4 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
"People doubted us this year because we have a lot of new guys that no one knew 
about," Nevin said. "But we never doubted ourselves. We knew we would contend 
for the conference title. We're going to surprise some people, and I think we 
already have." 
</P>
<P>
Popoff had a pleasant surprise in the bullpen before the game when he 
discovered his knuckleball, a pitch he had used sparingly this season, was 
working. He combined that with his fastball, curve, slow curve and changeup to 
keep the Bulldogs off-balance for much of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Popoff, who retired the first nine batters, allowed an RBI single to Todd 
Johnson in the fourth and a solo home run to Jeff Borgese in the seventh. Of 
his 10 strikeout victims, seven were caught looking, but his most impressive 
pitch got designated hitter Chris Gonzales swinging in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Knuckleballs are known to dance a bit, but this one did the Lambada, starting 
high and diving down and away from the left-handed hitters, who missed the 
pitch by at least a half-foot. 
</P>
<P>
"I got two or three ground-ball outs and a couple of strikeouts with the 
knuckler," Popoff said. "I haven't used it much before because I haven't needed 
it, but it was working well in the bullpen so I used it." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom third of Fullerton's order rallied in the fifth, as Steve Sisco, 
Domingo Mota and Kevin Farlow each singled with two outs. Farlow's hit scored 
Sisco to give the Titans a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin walked to load the bases, and Borgogno, a left-handed hitter, sliced a 
double into the gap in left-center field that bounced inches past center 
fielder Mike Noel's glove and rolled to the fence. That gave Fullerton a 5-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno and Sisco each had two hits to lead an eight-hit attack, and the 
Titans, who have the 12th-rated defense in the nation, played an errorless 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now, we haven't played total baseball," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell 
said. "We'd get good pitching with no hitting one night and good hitting with 
no pitching the next. Tonight, we got great pitching and the hits when we 
needed them."

RAPPING RIDER COLBY OUTLAW MOVES AT SEA AND ON SHORE

<TEXT>
<P>
Take a hike, M.C. Hammer. Bust a move, Young M.C. It's time to make room for 
Colby Outlaw, the rapping surfer from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport filled with charismatic characters, Outlaw can surf, and rap, with 
the best. Whether he's catching a tasty wave or finding time to rhyme, Outlaw 
has one rule -- be original. 
</P>
<P>
"My image is to not portray anything or anyone," Outlaw said. "I'm always in 
the limelight and I'm really energetic. I think God gives each of us a gift. 
Some get the gift of gab. Some get other gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Outlaw, 20, certainly has the gift of gab, and he's not afraid to use it. 
</P>
<P>
He and his surfing pal, Solo Scott, did their rap routines for anyone within 
earshot Friday at the Easter Surfing Classic at Bolsa Chica State Beach. Most 
of their lyrics are unprintable, but clever nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"Colby's a party animal," said surfer Anthony Ruffo of Santa Cruz. "He's really 
fun. He's a great rapper. He's a crowd favorite." 
</P>
<P>
During a stop on the Professional Surfing Assn. of America tour in Puerto Rico 
earlier this year, Outlaw jammed with a local band. 
</P>
<P>
"He jumped up on the stage and grabbed the mike," Ruffo said. "He was great." 
</P>
<P>
But Outlaw said his rap career probably won't go much further than the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it for fun," he said. "It's entertainment. I used to do a lot of dancing 
-- soul, breaking and popping -- then I got into rap. I love all kinds of 
music: reggae, rock, punk." 
</P>
<P>
Outlaw developed a knack for rhymes at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a little kid, I used to write a lot of poetry," he said. "Once I 
get going . . . I can really rip it off." 
</P>
<P>
The words come as naturally as surfing for Outlaw, who was one of eight Orange 
County competitors who won fourth-round qualifying heats Friday. They advanced, 
along with the second-place finishers, to today's fifth round against the top 
32 seeded surfers. The quarterfinals, semifinals and finals are scheduled for 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Outlaw wasted little time Friday showing why he is ranked No. 16 in the PSAA 
rankings. He carved the open face of each wave like an Easter ham, even buzzing 
by an unsuspecting bodyboarder who had wandered into the competition area. 
</P>
<P>
"His surfing is really quick and agile, kind of abrupt," said surfer Garth 
Tarlow of Fullerton. "He's got a lot of room to grow, but he should be a big 
name." 
</P>
<P>
And big names surf with the world tour. With a finish in the top 16 on the PSAA 
tour, Outlaw could get a shot at the major leagues of surfing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only 20 years old and I might give the world tour a try in a couple of 
years," said Outlaw, a 1988 graduate of Huntington Beach High School. "It's 
hard because you have to travel all over with the tour, but it would be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Outlaw certainly fits the surfer look. He's muscular and tan with sandy blond 
hair and a ready grin. 
</P>
<P>
But Outlaw is careful not to let his image overstep its bounds. He said he is 
concerned that surfers are characterized as trouble-making fools. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that portrayed the surfer image of the 1970s," Outlaw said. "It was 
all long hair and smoking dope, you know. That image sold in the 1970s and 
'80s, but now surfers are taking the sport seriously. We're athletes." 
</P>
<P>
And with the surf as his turf, Outlaw approaches life with a freewheeling 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Tarlow knows. 
</P>
<P>
"His last name kind of says it all," Tarlow said. "He's the Outlaw." 
</P>

PARACHUTES FLY HIGH IN SMALL WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THIS SINGING TRIO IS STARTING TO GET NOTICED AND THE MEMBERS HOPE THE 
GROUP WILL BECOME "THE BEATLES OF CHILDREN'S MUSIC" IN FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Move over Raffi, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois and Bram's "Elephant Show." In 
five years, Parachute Express hopes to be "the Beatles of children's music." 
</P>
<P>
Parachute who? 
</P>
<P>
Parachute Express is a trio of thirtysomething adults -- Donny Becker, Janice 
Hubbard and Stephen Michael Schwartz -- who are starting to get noticed for 
their sophisticated vocal harmonies and participatory, movement-oriented 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet the kind of notice reserved for the aforementioned Canadian stars who 
have dominated the children's music market. But with credits that include one 
cable-TV concert for the Disney Channel's Kaleidoscope series, two videos, five 
albums, 14 shows at Knott's Berry Farm's Camp Snoopy last September, sellout 
crowds and a national touring schedule, this emerging talent is understandably 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
After hopscotch East and West Coast tour stops, including a stop Saturday in 
Glendale, its next Orange County appearance will be at Anaheim's Celebrity 
Theatre on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview at Schwartz's Glendale home, the chemistry that binds the 
trio together was evident -- they're unrelated, but like close siblings often 
finish each other's sentences and speak in chorus. 
</P>
<P>
The "Beatles" comparison was a laughing, unison response to being asked about 
their hopes for the future. "Raffi can be Elvis," Hubbard conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Becker got serious. "Raffi does important work; he really has paved the way. We 
don't talk about our vision that much, but we believe in our music, and the 
chemistry between us feels so real, I think we'll continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Parachute Express has already outgrown the traditional, mostly public-domain 
folk sound of its 1985 first album, "Shakin' It." The group has found its niche 
in a slick mix of original songs in musical styles geared to young audiences, 
from '50s doo-wop and '60s rock, to R&amp;B and pop. 
</P>
<P>
"Our music sort of touches a baby-boomer nerve," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
It's feel-good music, dedicated to helping "a small child feel bigger in his 
world," Hubbard said. Songs range from goofy -- "Doo-Wacka-Doo" and 
"Goo-Goo-Giggly-I-Oh!," to practical -- "Tie a Bow," to lyrical -- "Pioneer 
Baby" and "Indian Lullaby." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Odegard, director of creative services for the music publishing company 
Filmtrax Copyright Holdings, while not professionally involved with the group, 
offers high praise. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered them as a parent going to elementary-school fairs," he said, "and 
became a fan because my kids walked around humming their melodies. The songs 
are well-written and well-crafted in the way great pop songs are. 
</P>
<P>
"In live performances," he said, "they have that same performance vibe as Raffi 
-- non-threatening, accessible and friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Parachute Express began as a non-performing, four-member group recording music 
for Gymboree, a movement/play program for parents and preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, a singer and former elementary school teacher, was, with wife Adrien, 
an early Gymboree franchise owner who decided to enhance the program with 
music. 
</P>
<P>
He enlisted his brother-in-law, Rick Cunha, and neighbor Schwartz. Both men are 
professional singers and songwriters; Schwartz is also an actor and a former 
preschool teacher; Cunha is an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz brought in singer-songwriter Hubbard, a friend from the '70s when they 
both were members of Story Theatre, the groundbreaking fairy-tale theater 
founded by Paul Sills. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just putting music together for Donny's program," Schwartz explained. 
"We weren't aware of what this was going to become." 
</P>
<P>
Public performances began when parents wanted to know where they could see the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet became a trio when Cunha, who has other professional interests, 
opted out of performing. He's still involved as both a musician and engineer. 
Schwartz's wife, Althea, co-manages the trio with producer/musician Peter 
Dergee. 
</P>
<P>
They're eager to stress that they're proud of the Gymboree affiliation, but 
it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be known as the ambassadors of Gymboree," said Becker. "Even 
when we began, we tried to make music that existed on its own." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the vocals, Becker and Schwartz play guitar; Hubbard plays the banjo 
and the flute. Performances are lively, with "choreography, space work and 
mime," using live and taped music. "We're 5 years old on stage," Becker 
enthused. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, 41, a dad with two young children, is jocularly referred to by the 
others as "grandpa." Hubbard, single, is 37; Schwartz, 36, has an 8-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
After a Parachute Express concert, "I'd like kids to come away with a feel for 
music and a sense of wonder at what the songs were about," Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are incredible critics," Schwartz said. "If we even try to fake it, 
we'll be busted, because kids know the truth. The minute we forget who we're 
doing it for, it's time to check out." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard added, "We stay connected, so it's fresh every single time." 
</P>
<P>
"We always go for something a little different," Stephen said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it comes across as real," Becker added. 
</P>
<P>
 Parachute Express will be at Glendale High Auditorium today at 2:30 p.m.;

Festival at Mariner's Point in Mission Bay for 10 performances, April 25-29,

GIMME SHELTER;

<P>
FOUNDED IN THE '70S BY STUDENT SQUATTERS, UCI'S LOW-RENT TRAILER PARK MAY GO 
MOBILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY SULLIVAN, Danny Sullivan is a free-lance writer based in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds rough, living in a thin-walled trailer the size of a large bedroom. 
Getting a decent shower means throwing on a bathrobe and walking down an 
asphalt road to a communal bathroom. On a cold night, the power fails when too 
many space heaters click on to combat the chill. And everyone has a story about 
leaks during heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine's only student trailer park, Irvine Meadows West, on the 
undeveloped edge of the campus, the grass grows long, the animals run wild and 
no home looks like another. Friends drop by with dinner or invite neighbors out 
to a movie, and every so often, a group gets together to tidy the grounds or to 
sing around a campfire. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Meadows West is home to about 100 students -- a low-priced, alternative 
form of university housing pioneered by UCI. It has survived for nearly 20 
years, ever since a handful of students first squatted in buses, vans and 
campers on the original site across from the college. 
</P>
<P>
The four-acre trailer park is sheltered from the nearby academic buildings, 
undergraduate apartments and a campus road running alongside it by hillsides 
and large trees. It opens toward pristine hills now green from rain. Fashion 
Island is off in the distance to the west, and nothing but open space is 
visible in between. To the south are more knolls, some with University Hills 
homes for faculty and staff peeking over the crest lines. 
</P>
<P>
Five years from now, however, buildings will stand on this site, and presently 
no one knows if there will be land on campus set aside to accommodate the 80 
trailers. Residents fear the worst: that someday there won't be an Irvine 
Meadows West. 
</P>
<P>
Renting the space for a trailer is $100 per month, with electricity and water 
thrown in. The community is friendly and laid-back, and a passing "hello" 
easily becomes a 10-minute conversation. And years without a building code have 
allowed the expansions of many trailers, resulting in a hodgepodge of 
odd-shaped and -sized room additions. This alone sets the settlement apart from 
the private apartments next to the university or other campus housing projects 
-- for which residents are grateful. 
</P>
<P>
"It kept me kind of sane," said Toby Buchanan, a two-year resident of Irvine 
Meadows West and one of its three student managers. "I don't like the Irvine 
attitude where all the colors have to be the same and you can't have your car 
in the alley." 
</P>
<P>
A walk along the asphalt fire road that separates the park's inner and outer 
rings of trailers reveals, for example, a white camper with "Al's Bed and 
Breakfast" written on its front in blue letters. An addition resembling a 
hillbilly's shack erupts skyward from its top. Others have patios and rooms 
attached to their sides. 
</P>
<P>
Residents grow strawberries and sweet peas, fertilized from small compost 
piles, in small gardens behind some of the trailers. The communal Circular 
Garden, about the size of a ball diamond, is filled with bamboo, 
licorice-smelling fennel and cacti. 
</P>
<P>
The garden was a thesis project by a fine arts major who lived in the park when 
it first opened, said Brian Miller, another of the park's managers. Scattered 
among the plants are large art projects, legacies from other residents. Giant 
ceramic feet stand silently, and a totem pole-like statue guards the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, there's nice bushes and trees and rabbits running around that don't look 
like they were stuck there," said Graham Davis, a sophomore art major and 
resident since January. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its idyllic setting, Irvine Meadows West is not a campground. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner's not cooked over a can of Sterno; it's zapped in the microwave. 
Entertainment's not limited to watching the sunset and going to sleep when 
darkness falls; there are plenty of stereos and VCRs. The nearest water supply 
is not a hike away; it comes from the tap, in hot or cold -- and you don't need 
to boil it to kill germs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of Kimberly Spears' friends thought the senior English major was 
crazy when she moved into the park a year ago. But two friends who saw the 
8-foot-wide, 40-foot-long trailer she bought from a former resident for $3,500 
signed up on the park's one-to-two-year waiting list the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Spears' 35-year-old trailer is essentially a long, wooden box without the 
stationary tables and seats of conventional recreational vehicles, allowing her 
to decorate and furnish it like a small house. She has a full-size refrigerator 
and a queen-size bed, a small blue couch and a little desk lit by a pink lamp 
-- all found in any regular apartment. And she has the place to herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like I'm living in a travel trailer," Spears said. "I'd lived in 
a dorm for a year, then shared a room, so coming in here, it felt spacious." 
</P>
<P>
Not all residents have trailers as nice as Spears'. Some live in small ones 
where the kitchen table doubles as a desk and folds up when there's need for a 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
Space is a constant consideration. Tiny refrigerators mean never buying a 
two-liter bottle of Coke, and minuscule freezers make the park's communal ice 
machine a popular appliance. It's a common sight to see residents clutching 
soap and shampoo as they stroll to the park's modest bathroom facility because 
their hot-water tanks are too small to provide a long shower. 
</P>
<P>
But these are minor inconveniences compared to other forms of student housing, 
residents say. To them, a rough life is paying an average $250 or more a month 
to share an apartment bedroom, on or off campus. There's not much privacy in 
those places either when people are squeezed into an apartment to lower 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The park's low rent attracts students without parental support or who lack 
hefty scholarships. "These are mostly independent students," said Jim Craig, 
UCI's director of housing, "who are trying to make it on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the rent, residents say they're attached to the park's strong sense of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Passannante, a junior fine arts major who has lived in the park since 
September, says residents look out for each other. Her neighbors know that she 
doesn't have a car, so they ask if she needs anything when they go shopping. 
When someone has extra food or furniture, it's donated to another resident. 
"Things don't get thrown away here," she said, "they move around." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents say the tight-knit community exists because of the people 
attracted to a lifestyle that provides life's necessities on a small scale. 
Residents are characterized as everything from "a real granola crowd" and 
"earthy" to "rebels" and "leaders," depending on whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
Another explanation for the community spirit could be that a smaller population 
is a closer one, said Gretchen Casey, acting associate director of the Campus 
Village undergraduate apartments. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 100 or so residents of Irvine Meadows West compared to almost 
800 students in Campus Village, UCI's undergraduate apartment complex. About 
11,500 of UCI's 16,000 students -- 72% of the campus student population -- live 
off campus, according to the UCI Housing Office. 
</P>
<P>
Turnover is slow at the park because once residents have a space, they may stay 
as long as they remain full-time students. An unenrolled roommate is allowed, 
which helps a few former residents hang on to the low-rent, idyllic life. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the old trailers with additions manage to hang on, too, rather than be 
rooted up and replaced when new residents move in. Residents like the extra 
space some of the older trailers offer, and depending on amenities, trailer 
prices can range up to $4,000. Most residents break even or make a small profit 
when they sell their trailers, but many invest time repairing and improving 
their homes after they buy them, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer park has moved three times since it began, gaining size and 
strength with each move, despite the odds. 
</P>
<P>
Its origins in the early 1970s were unlikely. Modern-day squatters living in 
buses, vans and campers on private property across from UCI asked the 
university if they could move onto the campus. The city of Irvine had taken aim 
at people like the squatters in the winter of 1972 by passing ordinances 
prohibiting sleeping in a vehicle and parking an RV on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing students to live in a housing experiment on campus during the time of 
the Vietnam War protests wasn't an easy idea for the proponents, including 
squatters and two campus officials, to pitch to the administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fairly revolutionary," said Robert F. Gentry, associate dean of 
students who was acting dean of students at the time. 
</P>
<P>
James Phillips, acting director of housing then, narrates a taped oral history 
of the park and recalls the different reactions to the idea: "The squatters' 
proposal was met head-on with a whole spectrum of closed minds. Safety people 
said it wouldn't be safe. Health people said it would be unhealthy. Insurance 
people said it would be risky. A vice chancellor said that people shouldn't 
live that way. When asked why, he said, 'Because it's a crummy way to live.' " 
</P>
<P>
But with a severe housing shortage on the 7-year-old campus, and 
then-Chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. behind the idea, doubts were pushed aside 
and a temporary site for 12 trailers was prepared. 
</P>
<P>
When it opened in September, 1973, Irvine Meadows -- as it became known after a 
small sign was posted by a resident in the early years -- boasted perks such as 
two toilets and a cold water tap. No electricity. No telephones. Rent was $10. 
</P>
<P>
The site changed once more in 1979 from near the present site of the Bren 
Events Center to its current location. A rent increase to $70 accompanied the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
While it may appear that the park has beaten the odds and is a permanent 
fixture at UCI, its biggest fight for survival is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
This month, construction begins on a road around the far side of the park which 
will effectively end its isolation. The park will no longer be forgotten on the 
edge of the campus but rather exist as part of the campus whole. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they fear that officials in the administration who think the 
park is an unsightly sprawl will eliminate Irvine Meadows West. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here at the edge of the campus, and it's wonderful. They're going to 
build a road around us, and who knows what that'll do? We want to plant trees 
and keep it enclosed," said resident Passannante. 
</P>
<P>
To address concerns over safety and appearance, the park's management agreed to 
a building moratorium after consulting with the campus housing office last year 
following a fire marshal's inspection, Buchanan said. Trailers moving into the 
park are restricted to 35 feet in length and 8 feet in width, and residents are 
required to keep areas around their spaces neat. 
</P>
<P>
Under the university's long-range plans, physical sciences classrooms, office 
space and research labs could be built on the park site in the next five years, 
according to Leon M. Schwartz, vice chancellor of administrative and business 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The park site "is seen as temporary," said housing director Craig. "That means 
some time in the future, it might be redesignated as academic space. I would 
like to think it would be relocated." 
</P>
<P>
The future area for new student housing -- where the park would probably be 
relocated -- is within view of the upscale community of Turtle Rock, on a hill 
overlooking UCI. 
</P>
<P>
The question asked by Schwartz is: If some administrators find a collection of 
trailers unsightly, "what are the people in Turtle Rock going to say?" 
</P>
<P>
Another concern, Schwartz said, is that high-density housing projects are 
prefered. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Irvine Meadows East remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
It's demise would sadden Christopher Stevens, a 1984 graduate student in fine 
arts who lived in Irvine Meadows and helped moved trailers to Irvine Meadows 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"That would just be terribly sad. It's a good institution. It would be an 
extreme loss," Stevens said. "Some people would not have been able to be 
students if it weren't for living there."

SEMINAR PROVIDES ADVICE ON CLOAKING CANCER'S DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, Patricia Arthur seems the picture of health. 
</P>
<P>
In a crowd of women, she stands out in her striking purple turban and the 
dramatic lavender eye shadow that accents her almond-shaped brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Only after she tells you she's a cancer patient do you notice the effects of 
chemotherapy: Fine pencil marks fill in where her eyebrows used to be, eye 
liner gives the illusion of lashes, blush colors a pale complexion and the 
turban hides her hair loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost my eyebrows and eyelashes, so I have to fake it," Arthur explains. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur has come from her home in Orange to Nordstrom in South Coast Plaza, 
Costa Mesa, on a recent Saturday morning to attend an "Image and Outlook" 
seminar for people with cancer. The seminar combines inspirational messages 
from cancer survivors with practical tips for improving a cancer patient's 
image, such as how to tie head wraps and apply makeup to camouflage loss of 
facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a woman, your look is so important," Arthur says. "To function, you have 
to look pretty, because you're going to get stared at, no matter what you do. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be creative. And you need to know you aren't what you are on the 
outside. It's what's inside that matters." 
</P>
<P>
Many come to the seminar not just to enhance their outward appearance but to 
gain inner strength. The crowd of mostly women fills an entire department in 
the store. Some bring friends and family. A few women arrive in wheelchairs, 
and one tows an oxygen tank. 
</P>
<P>
Here they can talk freely about cancer. Here they can meet others like 
themselves who are engaged in a battle to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I have metastasized breast cancer. It was discovered February first," says 
Judy Bergersen, a San Juan Capistrano resident and past president of the South 
County League of the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
"When you first learn you have cancer, you think you're going to die. Here, we 
can look around and see all these other women. We see them dressed up and 
walking around. And we realize, 'I can beat this.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible journey to take, but it helps knowing we're not alone. We're 
all here and we're with friends." 
</P>
<P>
The physical changes brought on by radiation treatment and surgery can 
devastate patients. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first lost my hair, it came out in gobs," Bergersen says. 
</P>
<P>
She quickly turned to scarves and hats, but found little additional information 
about products for cancer patients, a population often ignored by the fashion 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this big gap for those who need to redo their whole persona," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar begins with brief talks by speakers who have overcome cancer, 
including Jill Eikenberry of TV's "L.A. Law," who was found to have breast 
cancer shortly after filming the series pilot, and Selma Schimmel, founder of 
Vital Options, a support group that caters to young cancer victims. 
</P>
<P>
At the fashion show that follows, models wear head wraps or hats and show off 
comfortable mix-and-match clothes. Presentations by Dermablend and Estee Lauder 
representatives focus on makeup that conceals scars or discoloration and will 
not aggravate skin that can become sensitive from chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to do things differently," says Pat Shores, a Newport Beach 
cancer patient who showed up in an elegant red suit and hat. 
</P>
<P>
"Hats are so conspicuous that I hardly ever wear them. Wigs are not as 
comfortable. I don't usually wear scarves, but now I have to figure out how to 
tie them." 
</P>
<P>
After the presentation, patients adjourn to a private room, where they can try 
different head wraps, scarves, makeup and protheses. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Carpenter of Huntington Beach sits in her wheelchair before a table 
piled with colorful scarves while two Nordstrom employees show her how to wrap 
a turban. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any hair back here to hold it," she says. They teach her to wind 
the scarf tightly to keep it from slipping. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been wonderful," says Carpenter, who came to the seminar wearing a 
green felt hat. "Since I found out I have cancer, I've felt like I fell down a 
rabbit hole. It's so nice to have someone help make you feel beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
At a nearby demonstration, Shirley Weenig of Laguna Beach discovers a nylon cap 
that keeps her wig from sliding around on top of her head. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that something?" she says, smiling at her reflection in a hand mirror. 
"Without the cap, a good wind could come by and blow my wig right off." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of good humor inspires those who work with the patients. 
</P>
<P>
"They cherish life more than other clients," says Karen Erdman, a manager for 
Nordstrom. "I come out of this with a real good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Erdman helps patients who need to revamp their wardrobes in the store's 
"personal touch" program. Sometimes they have gained or lost weight and need 
new clothes, or they need soft fabrics that will not irritate their skin, and 
elasticized waistbands and button-down tops that make it easier to dress. 
</P>
<P>
"Some want to look better than they've ever looked," she says. "They need it 
more. They need people to say, 'You look great.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom is not alone in recognizing that cancer patients have special needs. 
</P>
<P>
Up to eight patients a week come into the Salon Russo in Brea to be fitted for 
wigs in a private room designed especially for them. David Russo and his 
father, Gene, have offered the service for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a void in this area," David Russo says. "Before we came 
along, the patients would have to go into a store's wig department serviced by 
an employee and pick a wig off the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
Often, they would choose wigs that didn't match their coloring or facial 
structure, or wigs that looked too stiff. 
</P>
<P>
"When people have chemotherapy, you can usually spot their wig 20 feet away," 
Russo says. 
</P>
<P>
The Russos, who deal in wigs and custom hairpieces, were already sensitive to 
their balding male customers who want private appointments so they will not 
have to peel off their toupees in front of other customers. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that cancer patients might also feel awkward, they started offering 
after-hours appointments and eventually set up an enclosed booth where they can 
be fitted in privacy. Area hospitals refer patients to the salon. 
</P>
<P>
The Russos then "cut what's left of their hair" and help them select a wig with 
the right shape, curl, body and color. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to put a jet-black wig on a 60-year-old woman," Russo says. 
</P>
<P>
Working with patients has special rewards for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Russo remembers an eighth-grade boy who has had cancer since he was 2. His 
parents wanted him fitted with a wig before he entered high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never seen a kid that age with cancer," he says. "It gets you thinking 
about your own problems. You think, 'If someone that young can handle this, 
he's one strong person.' " 
</P>
<P>
Russo finds that he has to be a bit of a psychologist when dealing with some 
patients. Some become so depressed when they first learn of the diagnosis that 
they can't get out of bed in the morning. Many don't like others knowing they 
have cancer, because some people still think the disease is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
"Many don't get any more hugs," Russo says. 
</P>
<P>
He tries to make up for that: "If you get a person feeling good about 
themselves, doctors have better luck caring for them."

CRUCIFIXION STORY'S DISTORTIONS HAVE BEEN BASIS OF MANY SINS; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD FRIDAY: ALTHOUGH CHRISTIANS HAVE CONFESSED GUILT FOR THE DEATH OF JESUS, 
JEWS HAVE USUALLY BORNE THE BRUNT OF HOSTILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christians on Good Friday marked the crucifixion of Jesus, whom they regard as 
manifesting God on Earth. Through twists of history, his death has been blamed 
variously on fellow Jews, Romans and a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
A noted professor of ancient history, Paul L. Maier, says it is "beyond debate" 
that the Roman governor Pilate delivered the execution verdict and bears the 
final legal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Theologically, however, Christians themselves, in recalling that event, 
acknowledge that their own sinful failings brought about the crucifixion, 
necessitating it to redeem humanity. 
</P>
<P>
They were involved. They "were there," a hymn for the day's services goes. Only 
through that confessed participation in the wrong do they find forgiveness for 
it through Jesus' suffering on the cross. 
</P>
<P>
It's regarded as the "atonement," the laying down of a sinless life to make 
amends for universal offenses against that goodness. In that purpose, "God so 
loved the world that he gave his only Son," Scripture says. 
</P>
<P>
The day is called "Good Friday" because the crucifixion is seen as absorbing 
the results of human wrongs in God himself, thus providing His pardon from 
them, His grace. 
</P>
<P>
It is the great saving act in the belief of Christians, the essential key to 
their ultimate salvation. For them, it is a topmost good. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that basic theology, however, various slants, contentions and 
distortions about Jesus' death have sometimes made it a bitter legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably no issue in the history of religion has elicited more blind 
partisanship, misinterpretation, faulty logic, hostility or fad following," 
Maier writes. 
</P>
<P>
The "pendulum has swung from one illogical -- indeed, ridiculous -- concept to 
another, from assuming Jewish generic involvement to arguing for no involvement 
at all," he writes in the April 9 issue of the evangelical fortnightly, 
Christianity Today. 
</P>
<P>
Maier, who teaches ancient history at Western Michigan University and who has 
written several books about 1st-Century Judaism, of which Jesus was a part, 
says the early church often bent Scripture to blame Jesus' fellow Jews. 
</P>
<P>
That notion of "Jewish collective responsibility" for the crucifixion had 
"horrifying results" through the centuries -- ghettoization, pogroms, the 
Inquisition, centuries of anti-Semitism, the Nazi Holocaust, Maier says. 
</P>
<P>
Past labeling of Jews as "Christ killers" was "illogical, unethical and 
misinterprets the gospels," Maier says. That falsehood has been repudiated by 
almost all churches, including the World Council of Churches and Roman 
Catholicism's Second Vatican Council. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says that in trying to atone for the past, it's become "high 
theological fashion to argue that no Jews were involved on Good Friday in the 
manner set forth" in the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
These arguments blame only Pilate, but to deny any Jewish participation "flies 
in the face of historical fact," including traditions in the ancient 
non-biblical Jewish sources, Maier writes. 
</P>
<P>
He says opposition to Jesus of the Jewish religious rulers, led by the high 
priest, is confirmed by the ancient Jewish historian Josephus' account of their 
later plotting the death of Jesus' kinsman, James. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly Jesus had his Jewish opponents," Maier says, and doubtlessly there 
was a group shouting "Crucify," but that "claque seems to have been primarily a 
throng from the temple -- a group perfectly orchestrated by Jesus' priestly 
adversaries. "But Jesus also had his Jewish friends and supporters on Good 
Friday and not just the timid 12 disciples," Maier says, citing the massive 
adulation he received on Palm Sunday and other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of Jewish Passover pilgrims must also have remained loyal to him," 
Maier says, but most of the pro-Jesus Jews "failed to learn of his arrest, 
hearings and trial until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
"He was arrested after many had retired for the night on Thursday, and he stood 
trial at dawn the next morning," Maier says. That early morning camouflage was 
arranged by Pilate apparently to avoid an uprising. 
</P>
<P>
However, Maier contends that past misinterpretations should not justify 
"tampering with the scriptural sources. Secular historical records of the 1st 
Century support the New Testament records," he says. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says Christians should always identify generalizing of "the Jews" 
in John's Gospel as meaning Jesus' Jewish opponents, never Jews in general. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean John's Gospel is anti-Semitic, Maier says, noting that 
Josephus also often refers to his opponents simply as "the Jews" without 
intending to generalize.

JODOROWSKY LOOKS AT HIMSELF AND UNCOVERS 'SANTA SANGRE'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE CANDID DIRECTOR'S 'WEIRD' SENSIBILITIES INFUSE A TENDER PORTRAYAL 
OF A MASS MURDERER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing can be more terrifying, or exhilarating, than absolute candor. And 
Alejandro Jodorowsky, the Chilean-Mexican-Parisian director who made the '70s 
cult hits "El Topo" and "The Holy Mountain" is nothing if not candid. When 
describing the generation of the eerie imagery in these movies, and in his 
latest, "Santa Sangre," he explains: "Everything came from me. I am a very 
weird person." 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Sangre" is a very weird movie. Shot in a voluptuous style that suggests 
Federico Fellini fused with modern slasher movies, it's an unnervingly tender, 
magical portrayal of a mass murderer, Fenix, and his childhood traumas. 
</P>
<P>
Its imagery blends circus fantasy and horrific carnage. A huge elephant dies of 
a nosebleed, receives a loving funeral procession and is devoured by peasants. 
A gigantic super-woman mangles masked wrestlers. A cultish temple, torn down by 
wreckers, has a pool filled with blood. An amputee mother forces her own son to 
be her "arms": Their joint mime routine suggests Jodorowsky's stint as 
assistant to mime artist Marcel Marceau. 
</P>
<P>
From where do these bizarre notions emerge? "From my liver," insists 
Jodorowsky. "My ideas come like dreams . . . suddenly. And when it happens, I 
say 'Thank you!' to my unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
This interview is a little weird too. Connections were missed with Jodorowsky 
when he was in Los Angeles, so we're catching up by phone. It's morning in 
L.A., evening in Paris where he lives. He apologizes, in a charmingly fractured 
accent that suggest equal parts of Mel Blanc and Ricardo Montalban: "This is my 
English; I have not another English. If you can understand me, is good." 
</P>
<P>
"El Topo" and "The Holy Mountain" probably sum up the fantasies of the period 
-- the fascination with outlaw culture, sexuality and primitive myth -- as much 
as the novels of Tom Robbins or Kurt Vonnegut, the comics of R. Crumb, or, 
earlier, the music of the Beatles and The Who. They're quintessential, if 
slightly cracked, period artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
"When I made 'El Topo,' " Jodorowsky says, "I didn't know what I was doing. I 
made it because I needed to." 
</P>
<P>
But he had made no movies at all in the 10 years between "Tusk" and "Santa 
Sangre." 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Sangre" was inspired by the actual story of the Mexican serial killer, 
Goio Cardenas, who murdered women and buried them in his garden. He was 
eventually arrested and sent to an asylum. Emerging a decade later with no 
apparent memory of his crime, Cardenas married and became a lawyer and writer. 
</P>
<P>
Jodorowsky, hired by a producer who wanted a crime quickie, studied the case. 
He interviewed Cardenas, went to his house, visited the "garden" -- and had his 
script rejected as too bizarre. It was finally rescued by Claudio Argento, 
younger brother of Italian horror specialist Dario Argento. Along the way, the 
personalities of Cardenas and Jodorowsky began to fuse. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this identification stems from Jodorowsky's own tormented home life: an 
absent father, a dominating mother. "Now my mother's dead. But even now I 
realize how much I hated her, and how much I loved her. What I thought was hate 
was love. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell in the picture only the essential thing: A person who kills women, who 
repents, who tries to buy his soul and get enlightenment . . . . I asked 
myself: 'Why am I so interested in this?' And then I realized I was a 
psychological murderer. I was, all my life, in my unconscious, killing women." 
</P>
<P>
Is he talking here, by extension, about the way most men treat women? "Sure. I 
believe the power of the men in our society is getting worse and worse. We are 
afraid of women's equality. I believe the woman's revolution is only 
superficial . . . The day I see the Pope, the Papa, with a woman Papa near him, 
then I will believe this society is androgynous." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster himself, Jodorowsky experienced three artistic shocks. First, 
there was German Expressionist dance; then pantomime; then the surrealists. 
When he finally got to Paris, he called up writer Andre Breton, a patriarch of 
the last group, at one in the morning and demanded to speak to him, saying: "I 
am the biggest surrealist you will ever know!" 
</P>
<P>
He also had a memorable encounter with the late Nobel laureate Samuel Beckett. 
"He was drinking Irish beer in a very white little apartment, and all the 
window looked out on a jail. From his window, all you could see was the hundred 
little windows of the prison." 
</P>
<P>
Over and above these influences however, there was always the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life . . . movies was the most important thing. I was very solitary 
boy: immigrant, white, with a big nose. They called me 'Pinocchio.' The movies 
were the only friend I could have. I loved Erich Von Stroheim, 'The Cabinet of 
Dr. Caligari,' 'Frankenstein' and Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre 
Dame.' I get crazy!" 
</P>
<P>
His philosophical teachers, he says, were the Marx Brothers. "For me, there are 
not three, but four: Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo. If you look closely, they 
are all in 'Santa Sangre.' Axel (Jodorowsky's eldest son), who plays the 
criminal, is Groucho. The little boy, the child, is Chico. My son who plays the 
dealer of cocaine is Harpo. My son who plays the assistant of the doctor, we 
called Zeppo -- because he's not comic." 
</P>
<P>
Jodorowsky is sanguine again about the future, which will probably include a 
sequel to his most famous film, called "Sons of El Topo" and starring his four 
sons. "I am a surrealistic optimist. I think we can get out of this madness. 
Myself from the '80s, I am saying: 'I am optimist, I am optimist.' All the 
persons laugh at me. But look at today: Berlin, Pinochet, democracy in Chile, 
Bucharest. It's very weird in the world now. For the first time in years: 
optimistical visions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in the repetitions of history. I believe we will forget this 
century as my character forgets everyone he kills. Humanity will forget us, all 
our works. The 20th Century will be forgotten. All our civilization will be 
like Goio Cardenas. We killed millions of persons, but we'll not remember 
anymore. Because we'll get cured."

MODERN-DAY THOREAU TAKES A LIGHTER LOOK AT NATURE IN 'SIDE OUT' SCRIPT; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DAVID THOREAU MAKES NO APOLOGIES TO HIS DISTANT RELATIVE ABOUT THE 
THEME OF HIS FIRST SCREENPLAY. HIS MOVIE ABOUT BEACH VOLLEYBALL IS PLAYING IN 
THEATERS ACROSS THE NATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Like his distant relative, Henry David Thoreau, Laguna Beach writer David 
Thoreau has an affinity for nature and the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
So for his first screenplay, "Side Out," this Thoreau chose as his setting a 
late-20th-Century Walden Pond where millions of Southern Californians head for 
reflection: the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"With apologies to Frankie and Annette, it's the best beach movie ever," says 
Thoreau, who makes no apologies of his own to Henry David about the good-time 
subject material of the movie that currently is playing across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an excellent spring-summer movie," he said. "It's uplifting, 
energetic. It's for the audience that falls somewhere between 'Ninja Turtles' 
and 'Driving Miss Daisy.' " 
</P>
<P>
That "Side Out" isn't "Walden," nor does it try to be, doesn't bother Thoreau, 
though it did result in an unfavorable comparison raised in Michael 
Wilmington's movie review for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like killing a sand flea with a sledgehammer," Thoreau said. "My five 
novels have all been reviewed extensively, and no reviewer has ever compared my 
books to 'Walden,' one of the great works in American literature. Besides, this 
was a story about beach volleyball, hardly a transcendental subject. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that, unlike a novelist, where you're totally responsible for the 
finished product, a screenwriter quickly becomes an interested bystander," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau, who grew up in San Francisco but has lived in Laguna for nine years, 
decided on the subject of beach volleyball as a means of capturing what he 
calls "the essence of the California lifestyle." While first attempting the 
script four years ago, he consulted his friends, Greg and Jon Lee, both beach 
competitors. Jon Lee is editor of Volleyball Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's healthy, a total game, with no specialists like in some sports," he said. 
"The way I approached the story was to write a movie about what it would be 
like for a Midwesterner to see the beach for the first time. Visually, it's a 
fantastic sport." 
</P>
<P>
For Thoreau, this was his first attempt at breaking into the movie business, 
although he has done extensive work in television in recent years, having 
written for "Highway to Heaven," "The Street," "Miami Vice," "Quantum Leap" and 
"Dirty Dozen." 
</P>
<P>
This month promises to be a big one for Thoreau, the modern author. His new 
mystery novel, "The Book of Numbers," is being published in paperback (Pocket 
Books, $3.95). It's a sequel to his 1988 novel "The Good Book," a mystery 
revolving around sports betting and a fictitious Los Angeles football team, the 
Los Angeles Marlins, whose owner dies of unnatural causes and whose wife takes 
over the team. 
</P>
<P>
Times sports columnist Jim Murray called it "a crackling good, gritty Southern 
California mystery in the best hard-boiled (Raymond) Chandler tradition." It 
has been optioned for a movie. 
</P>
<P>
The new book is the second in a series revolving around his lead character, 
Jimmy Lujack, a former vice cop who becomes a bookie in Los Angeles. "The Book 
of Numbers" stars Lujack again. In it, Lujack picks up his partner's niece from 
the Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Springs. The next time he sees her, she's been 
decapitated in a ritualistic killing. The suspects include characters from the 
kinky Melrose nightclub scene to the Southern California defense industry and 
the Japanese underworld, the Yakuza. 
</P>
<P>
As far as writing goes, Thoreau doesn't seem to prefer one medium over the 
other. "A screenplay is a completely different process than writing a novel. 
It's much more collaborative. You work with the director, the producer and the 
actors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's currently working on a new screenplay, not about beach volleyball. But 
he's hopeful that the limited opening run of "Side Out" will get to reach a 
wider audience. It opened two weeks ago in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
Seattle, Cincinnati, Tampa, St. Petersburg and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for the best," he said.

TWO PULITZER PRIZES IN THE RIGHT KEY; 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSER: MEL POWELL WINS FOR A PIANO CONCERTO HE DIDN'T KNOW HAD BEEN 
NOMINATED.

"I'm looking at my hand right now to see if it's still trembling," said 
composer Mel Powell, laughing into the phone at his CalArts office a half hour 
after learning that he had won the Pulitzer prize for music. 
</P>
<P>
"And I am positively ecstatic, especially since it comes as a total surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old academic, who moved to California two decades ago as founding 
dean of the Disney-endowed school's music department, said that his winning 
piece, "Duplicates: a Concerto for Two Pianos," was submitted to the Pulitzer 
board without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The telegram stating the happy news arrived Thursday at Powell's Van Nuys home 
after his departure for the Valencia campus and was received by his wife, 
actress Martha Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"But she had not yet been able to get through to me," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I showed up for a graduate student's lesson -- in orchestral writing 
-- he was just getting off the phone at my desk. 'Someone from back East,' 
Arturo (Marquez, the student) said, unimportantly. 'They'll call again.' 
</P>
<P>
"We started having our lesson when another call came. This time it was Susan 
Feder, the veep of G. Schirmer (Powell's music publisher). 
</P>
<P>
" 'Congratulations,' she said. And I thought uh, huh, this would be one of 
those typical financial dealings that go on between composers and publishers, 
that she'd probably found a hundred bucks belonging to me. 
</P>
<P>
" 'OK, what is it?' I said. It turns out she had heard the Pulitzer 
announcement on the radio in New York and never suspected that the news hadn't 
yet reached me. Meanwhile, Arturo knew about it from the previous call and 
refused to say a word. 
</P>
<P>
"But after the big bang, there were other surprising elements to consider. Like 
being out here on the coast, far away from the whole Eastern Establishment to 
which the Pulitzer is connected. That made me a remote prospect. I just didn't 
expect it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the three judges in Powell's category -- composers Roger Reynolds (the 
1989 Pulitzer-winner who teaches at UC San Diego) and Donald Martino (who 
teaches at Harvard) and New York-based critic David Hamilton of the Nation -- 
cover a wide geographic range. And the single runner-up for the 1990 prize is 
Chicago-based composer Ralph Shapey. 
</P>
<P>
So who did Powell suppose submitted the piece? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to sort it out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But my guess is Andre Previn," who, as then-music director of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, together with managing director Ernest Fleischmann and patron 
Betty Freeman, commissioned the double concerto last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that fellow," Powell said with an affectionate chuckle. "It's the kind 
of thing he would do." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Previn -- an admirer of Powell's from the '40s when the two tooled 
around Hollywood as music men with jazz-pop-film careers -- owned up to the 
deed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't take full credit," he said, "because if Hank O'Neal, a friend of 
Mel's in the record business, had not called me with the vital information 
about the Pulitzer deadline, March 1, this would not be happening. I had 
thought we had another 10 months to put things together. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 48 hours I got the forms, sent them off with the fee and express-mailed 
the tape. But I must say I'm surprised it went our way, given the many 
mysterious choices usually made by the Pulitzer music committee." 
</P>
<P>
In an ironic laugh that harked back to his resignation last season as 
Philharmonic director, Previn went on to say: "I've not been as happy about any 
recent happening in this city as I am about Mel's great win. He certainly 
deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann added his kudos. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have happened to a nicer piece," he said, then added that a 
Philharmonic commission has never before won a Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this award to Mel Powell is wonderful for every possible reason and 
I'm proud to be the midwife or, shall we say, midhusband. It should get a wide 
currency." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Fleischmann said he has sent tapes to European orchestras, and Previn 
has scheduled the work next year on one of his programs with the Royal 
Philharmonic in London. 
</P>
<P>
The other benefactor, Betty Freeman, said, "the pleasure (of helping make it 
possible) was all mine. I knew at rehearsal that it was a masterpiece, as well 
as the first universal work of music -- a passionate and profound one -- to 
come out of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Lavine, president of CalArts, lauded Powell for "a daring and vision 
that has been present all along not only in his music but in his ideas, that 
are the very foundation of our institute in Valencia." 
</P>
<P>
Conductor David Allan Miller led "Duplicates" at its January premiere. 
Originally, Previn and Powell were supposed to play the exceedingly difficult 
piano parts, but the prize-winner's physical disability and Previn's hectic 
schedule made that plan inoperable, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
As a post-Schoenbergian serialist, Powell has been associated with other 
American composers such as Milton Babbitt and Elliott Carter -- dubbed "the 
difficult trio." But before establishing this identity, Powell had, beginning 
as a teen-ager, a celebrated career as a jazz pianist, joining the Benny 
Goodman band where he wrote his first string trios and brass quintets. 
</P>
<P>
Powell has admitted that the music he and Babbitt and Carter write is 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
"'But the bottom truth for a composer resides in technical matters. We live in 
theory, which explains the very skeleton of music, of a fugue, for instance. I 
can't believe Goethe, who thought that all theory was gray. Rather I trust 
Einstein, who says that theory is laden with mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"I subscribe to atonality because it's egalitarian. It cancels hierarchy and 
creates anarchy, the ideal musical state." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Powell spoke to The Times about this "private art" he practices, 
writing austere music for minuscule audiences and happily giving up "the bitch 
goddess" of his youth: jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"I joined a guild peopled by Bach and Mozart," he said of his composer 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"How dare I sit and whine while belonging to that domain? You do the noblest 
you can and then hope to be embraced for it."

TWO PULITZER PRIZES IN THE RIGHT KEY; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYWRIGHT: AUGUST WILSON TAKES HONORS FOR 'PIANO LESSON,' HIS SECOND WIN IN 
FOUR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thursday's news that his "The Piano Lesson" had won the Pulitzer Prize for 
drama caught playwright August Wilson largely unprepared. It was only three 
years ago, after all, that he won the Pulitzer for "Fences." 
</P>
<P>
Once is terrific, but twice? 
</P>
<P>
"I was just so busy trying to get the show open that I wasn't even thinking 
about it. I'm very honored and very much delighted by it," Wilson said on the 
phone from the Walter Kerr Theatre in New York, where "The Piano Lesson" is set 
to open Monday, its future pretty much assured. "Surprised too. Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
"I also feel it is a testament and reward for the actors who've worked on the 
show for two years and have turned down other jobs to do it, giving me the 
opportunity to continue to work on the play. This just adds fuel to the fire. 
It makes me want to sit down and start another one right away." 
</P>
<P>
"The Piano Lesson" is the fourth play (fifth, if you count "Jitney," an early 
piece that never made it) in a Wilson cycle about black American life in 
different decades of the 20th Century. The cycle started with "Ma Rainey's 
Black Bottom" in 1984, then continued with "Fences" (1987, which also won the 
Tony) and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" (1988). In all cases, Wilson's director 
was Lloyd Richards, artistic director of the Yale Repertory Theatre and a 
founder of the O'Neill Playwrights Conference in Connecticut, where he first 
became acquainted with Wilson's work. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 44, began his career as a poet and short-story writer who submitted 
five scripts to the O'Neill before "Ma Rainey" was accepted. He had come to 
playwriting late and largely self-taught. He readily acknowledges his debt to 
Richards, who has championed his work and been his mentor and friend for the 
better part of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we got to 'Piano Lesson,' " Wilson said during the Los Angeles run 
of the play earlier this year, "Lloyd knew how I worked, I knew how he worked. 
One of the things that has made the relationship successful is that I don't 
direct for Lloyd and he doesn't write for me." 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the outpouring of congratulations, Wilson claimed Thursday that 
the idea for "Piano Lesson" had come from a painting by black artist Romare 
Bearden (who also inspired "Joe Turner") of a young girl sitting at a piano 
with her teacher standing over her. 
</P>
<P>
"I know very little about my characters when I start with the dialogue," he had 
explained earlier this year. "I flesh out a character usually by way of him 
revealing something about himself, generally through a story that he relates. 
The more I know, the more fleshed out my characters become." 
</P>
<P>
"The Piano Lesson" is set in the '30s (as in so many of his plays, the locale 
is his native Pittsburgh, where he lived until he was 33). It begins with a 
sister and brother, Berniece and Boy Willie, who have jointly inherited a 
heavily carved ancestral piano and are at odds about what to do with it. The 
play -- which, among other things -- mines the world of the supernatural, 
began, Wilson said, with a question: Can you acquire a sense of self-worth by 
denying your past? "That turned into what to do with your legacy and how best 
to put it to use for you," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson also has acknowledged another powerful influence on "Piano Lesson": 
the blues world -- specifically a song by Skip James called "Special Rider." 
</P>
<P>
"Listening to it," Wilson had said, "I thought, 'Boy, if I could write a play 
like this. . . . ' It's very elegant and powerful. It has a beautiful guitar 
line and then he thrashes across it.. . . . I consciously tried to mimic its 
beauty in 'Piano Lesson.' I find in the music the ideas and attitudes of the 
characters and I dig 'em out. Music has this kind of baptismal grace that just 
spills over." 
</P>
<P>
"The Piano Lesson," which opened at the Yale Rep in November, 1987, skipped 
over to Boston's Huntington Theatre in January, 1988, before seriously hitting 
the road a year later. It then traveled to Chicago's Goodman Theatre, the San 
Diego Old Globe, Washington's Kennedy Center and Los Angeles' Doolittle 
Theatre, where it closed April 1.
