Thanks to NBC, I can now get some work done because I won't have to sit in 
front of the TV watching my favorite game show. NBC took off the wonderful 
"Sale of the Century." When they cancel "Classic Concentration," I will sell my 
TV and go work for McDonald's.

American TV stations were supposedly being freed of prior constraints when the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) summarily repealed its 38-year-old 
Fairness Doctrine in 1987. The rule, which required stations to give balanced 
treatment of "controversial issues of public importance," supposedly inhibited 
them from tackling troublesome hot potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, says a new study, those uninhibited stations now give less time to 
public affairs than they did before the rule was thrown out. Comparing 
programming aired on commercial stations in 1988 with a similar period in 1979, 
Essential Information, a public-interest research group, found a 51% decrease 
in the amount of time devoted to "issue-oriented public affairs" material. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who founded the group, says, "This study refutes 
FCC predictions that repeal of the Fairness Doctrine would remove an impediment 
to presenting issue-oriented public-affairs programming on television." 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and his telecommunications 
subcommittee have begun marking up legislation to restore the Fairness Doctrine 
and make it law. Markey says the study "underscores the importance of Congress 
reinstating the Fairness Doctrine as soon as possible" and reveals the 
"intellectual bankruptcy" of the FCC's rationale for killing it. 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate voted to make the doctrine law in 1987, but President 
Reagan vetoed the bill. Reagan and his FCC clung to the idea that marketplace 
forces would compel stations to do their civic duties, but the record shows 
they have cut back on the kind of public-minded programming that benefits the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the fallout from deregulation has been an epidemic of trashy, 
gutter-minded tabloid TV shows like "A Current Affair," "Geraldo" and "The 
Reporters." Some stations actually consider these to be public-affairs 
programming. They sometimes deal in affairs, but that's about as far as it 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
For its Fairness Doctrine study, Essential Information looked at programming on 
217 TV stations in 50 markets from January through April of last year and 
compared it with a similar period nine years earlier. Jim Donahue, the staff 
researcher who wrote the report, says that local TV Guides were used to gather 
programming data because the FCC no longer requires stations to file their 
program logs. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue says that the FCC couldn't care less about the public interest and that 
its decision to repeal the Fairness Doctrine was "based totally on ideology to 
enhance corporate interests rather than the interests of the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Lawrence, speaking for the FCC, was not impressed by Donahue's findings. 
"This report is nothing short of outrageous," she said. "There is nothing in my 
data file that corroborates this study." Lawrence claims networks and local 
stations are doing more public-affairs programming, not less. 
</P>
<P>
The very day that the study was released, FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick was at 
the White House submitting his resignation. The resignation had nothing to do 
with the study. The Bush Administration is expected to name a successor who has 
a less fanatical ideological agenda -- and someone who thinks the job of a 
regulatory agency is to regulate, not stand back and watch. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, kinder and gentler television may be on its way. 
</P>
<P>
Some aspects of the doctrine remained in force after 1987, mainly those 
concerning ballot issues such as referendums and propositions. A report 
released in February by the Public Interest Research Group found many stations 
unaware that such provisions were in effect. Of those that acknowledged such a 
requirement, the study found, 98% "agreed to present opposing points of view" 
on such issues as California's voter crusade to cut insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
But among stations that considered all Fairness Doctrine obligations to be 
extinct, only 56% were willing to give time to opposing viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
"This conclusion stands as powerful evidence that the Fairness Doctrine works," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources on Capitol Hill say the new, revived Fairness Doctrine should reach the 
House floor by the end of April. The Supreme Court may be asked eventually to 
rule on its constitutionality, though it upheld the principle behind the 
doctrine in its landmark Red Lion decision in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue says no TV network sent reporters to cover the press conference at 
which the results of the study were revealed. He called one network to tell it 
of the report on the Fairness Doctrine and the response he got was, "the what 
Doctrine?"

A PRETTY FACE CAN COST AN ARM AND A LEG

<P>
NOBODY'S perfect," proclaims a recent cover of Harper's Bazaar. Hope springs 
eternal, I think, eager to discover "what to wear if you are too tall, short or 
heavy." Ever the slave to beauty, I quell my suspicions that this is another 
ruse to sell me something and turn to Page 82, where Aphrodite's secrets will 
be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Fooled again! The imperfections under consideration are those of such 
disfigured wretches as Paulina Porizkova (sharply defined bone structure), Kim 
Alexis (a thin top lip) and Cheryl Tiegs (too tall). Suddenly, I'm depressed. 
If these are flaws, I'm a walking disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But not to worry. A beauty addict can always find some new, revolutionary 
beauty fix on the horizon, especially if she's willing to fork over a couple of 
months' salary. Women (and men) are no longer paying even lip service to the 
concept that beauty comes from within. They now know that beauty comes from 
investments in French manicures, shiatsu pedicures, herbal body wraps, 
custom-blended makeup in a personalized seasonal palette, $2,500 Chanel suits, 
daily workouts with a personal trainer and a few nips and tucks by a plastic 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, whatever you do is never enough. Recently, for example, I invested the 
equivalent of a week's groceries in a facial. For 20 minutes, I lay sweating in 
a thick cloud of steam, my skin encrusted with gritty, lime-green pore 
cleanser. Then the cosmetician smothered me with a wet towel, covered my eyes 
with tea-soaked cotton and began assaulting my cheek with a sharp instrument. 
Finally, I lay motionless for half an hour while an enzyme masque removed a 
layer of skin. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, I basked in the satisfaction that one part of my body was under 
beauty control -- for a glorious second. Then my beauty policewoman scowled. 
"You really should be using our revitalizing neck cream," she warned me. 
</P>
<P>
Neck cream? This was new. So far this year, people have tried to sell me eye 
cream, lip cream, day cream, night cream, foot cream, hand cream and breast 
cream. Will ear cream be next? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win," says my sister, Laurie. "You could spend 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week on your appearance, and you would still miss some critical beauty 
maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie is right. I religiously go to the gym three times a week. Surrounded by 
grunting would-be Mr. Universe manques, I lie upside down on a slant board and 
pump ridiculous amounts of weight with my feet. Then I ride the LifeCycle for 
half an hour and finish with 20 minutes of stretching. 
</P>
<P>
And I still feel as if I'm shirking. After all, there are people who go from 
the LifeRower to the StairMaster to the treadmill to the Versa Climber to the 
free weights, and that's not even counting the classes that feature muscle 
conditioning with huge rubber bands, six different "impacts" of aerobics, 
Aerobic Slimnastics, Jazzercise and yoga. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do gyms," scoffs Laurie, who believes that I'm beauty-obsessed. "I 
don't need a personal trainer. I have a dog. I pick her up occasionally. She 
weighs 42 pounds; that's as close as I get to Nautilus. I run her around the 
block a few times. She goes one way; I go another. It's resistance." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, I can't believe that we were raised by the same mother. My beauty 
addiction began in the womb. "When I went to the hospital to have you, I wore 
an exquisite nightgown and a matching peignoir," my mother recalls. "And I had 
beautiful white mules with high heels and little bows, and, of course, my hair 
was all fixed. I looked like I had stepped out of a magazine. I went into the 
labor room, and the nurse said, 'Where do you think you're going in that? It's 
see-through.' " 
</P>
<P>
"When Mom had me, she went into labor at the Dairy Queen," Laurie says. "That's 
the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, my sister recently jumped at a chance to be the model for a 
beauty makeover for a women's magazine. "It was a nightmare," she says. "I went 
in looking about as bad as I could. I rolled out of bed. I didn't brush my 
hair, which is not that unusual. I hadn't slept in a week. I thought I looked 
plenty bad enough, but they wanted to make sure that the circles under my eyes 
really showed, so they darkened them in for the 'before' picture." 
</P>
<P>
Next, they photographed her in the same complexion-dissolving light that's 
usually found in department-store dressing rooms. As for the "after" picture: 
"I spent an entire day having people fuss over me so I looked perfect," Laurie 
laments. "I was in the beauty shop for five hours." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line? "I did find out that, with enough makeup, I could look like an 
anchorwoman," she says. She estimates that it would cost her $300 a month, plus 
an additional 10 hours a week, to duplicate this look. "Of course, if I were an 
anchorwoman, it would be worth it," Laurie says. "And I could afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, many people believe that they can't afford not to look like an 
anchorperson. More curiously, not all of these people are women. The other day, 
I ran into my friend Jeff at the hairdresser's. He was smocking up for a 
conditioning shampoo and trim. "Your looks are something you have to maintain 
in this society," says Jeff, who spends his working day locked in an editing 
room with a Moviola. "I have an advantage over people who are less 
good-looking, so I work to keep the advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Where does he draw the line? "I know guys who go to a tanning salon, and I 
think that's over the top," he says. "I don't get my nails done or get facials. 
I don't see the need. That seems more like a luxury than a requirement for 
beauty. If I was on vacation in a spa or a resort and that service was offered, 
I might indulge. But I think plastic surgery is obscene." 
</P>
<P>
My friend Doug disagrees. "I'd have a face lift in a minute," he says. "If my 
jowls were sinking, I'd go to Beverly Hills and have it taken care of." Why? "I 
feel that I look better when I look younger," he says. "And when I feel better 
about myself, I'm more creative. I don't want to turn it into a business 
decision, but it's that important." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd try just about anything," says my friend Katie, who is about to 
give up on her regimen of mail-order cactus moisturizers and drive to Tijuana 
to buy Retin-A over the counter. "I don't draw any lines. The object is to get 
rid of the lines." Katie does confess that she prefers to avoid anything that 
causes pain, unless she is knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of being knocked out . . . A few months ago, my beauty bibles reported 
that au courant eyes would be shadowed and lined in rich shades of purple. So I 
made my semiannual pilgrimage to the cosmetics counter. There, a lacquered 
makeup artist expertly smudged my eyelids with a palette of dusty, smoky and 
downright dirty plums. 
</P>
<P>
"See how natural this looks," she gushed, as she coated my lashes with navy 
blue mascara. "It really brings out your eyes." It also brought out my 
checkbook. Forty-five dollars later, clutching a small bag filled with two tiny 
boxes (I didn't spend enough to rate the free gift), I left the store. Shortly 
thereafter, I ran into a friend. "Are you and your husband getting along?" my 
friend asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," I said, widening my perfectly shadowed eyes. She seemed 
unconvinced. So did the next person I ran into. And the next. I couldn't 
understand why everyone kept asking about the state of my marriage. Then I 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
"Were you in an accident?" my husband asked. I shook my head. "Don't tell me 
you got into a fight," Duke said. I shook my head again. "Then where did you 
get the black eye?" 
</P>
<P>
Fooled again!

LOOKS: BURNING ISSUES;

<P>
NEW HEALTH SCARES CAUSE CONFUSION AND CONTROVERSY OVER SUNSCREENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
ALTHOUGH SKIN-CARE and medical experts continue to urge the public to wear 
products with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of at least 15, choosing the right 
protection is becoming increasingly difficult and, in some ways, downright 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, news agencies reported that some sunscreen products containing 
Padimate O were contaminated with the nitrosamine 
N-methyl-N-nitroso-p-aminobenzoic acid octyl ester (known as NPABAO). Other 
nitrosamines have been found in cigarette smoke, automotive exhaust and even in 
some foods. Some nitrosamines have been shown to cause cancer in lab animals. 
The news caused concern among those who wear sun protection daily. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, according to John Wenninger of the Food and Drug 
Administration, there is no conclusive evidence that the nitrosamine found in 
sunscreens containing Padimate O is a carcinogen. Wenninger, an FDA official 
who was involved in the research that spawned the reports, says: "There is no 
information to indicate that using a sunscreen represents a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet been able to tell if the nitrosamine in sunscreens can 
penetrate the skin," he continues. The FDA has issued no new warnings about 
sunscreens, and no products or ingredients have been withdrawn based on the 
findings. More research is under way. "Certainly, consumers should not stop 
using sunscreens," Wenninger says. 
</P>
<P>
But consumers face yet another confusing issue. Many sunscreen users believe 
that products labeled SPF 15 or higher provide adequate protection. However, 
the SPF numbers, established by the FDA, refer only to protection against the 
sun's ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, once thought to be the only harmful rays. Now, 
ultraviolet A (UVA) rays, the so-called tanning rays, are considered as 
dangerous as UVB, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. But numbers 
to indicate the amount of UVA protection have not yet been standardized. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Beio, manager of personal-care products for Amway, explains that UVA rays 
penetrate deeper into the dermis, "resulting in long-term damage, such as 
cancer and the breakdown of the collagen and elastin fibers, which support the 
skin. UVB rays burn the upper layers, apparent as a sunburn. UVA damage is 
indicated by a tan that takes 24 to 72 hours to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Iris Model of Clinique reports that although an SPF 30 blocks about 99% of UVB 
rays, "we cannot guarantee that for UVA." However, she says, ingredients such 
as benzophenone, octyl salicylate and Padimate O also screen a broad range of 
rays, including UVA. 
</P>
<P>
According to industry reports, the $450-million-a-year sun-products category is 
one of the fastest-growing segments of the personal-care market. Yet, consumers 
are still not sure which products to buy. Ruth G. Sikes, a representative of 
the American Academy of Dermatology, urges consumers to read labels and 
continue wearing products with an SPF 15 or higher. "It is still the first line 
of defense against the ravages of the sun," she says. 
</P>

WINE: A CAPITAL TASTE; 
</P>
<P>
A CRESTON MANOR WINE FIT FOR THE PRESIDENT IS A CANDIDATE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
LARRY AND Stephanie Rosenbloom, owners of Creston Manor Vineyard and Winery, 
have made great strides since buying cattle-grazing land a few miles inland 
from San Luis Obispo in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bush Inaugural in Washington in January, Creston Manor winery was among 
the select group of American wineries pouring their finest. 
</P>
<P>
The Creston Manor wine that was served was the winery's newest. The 1988 
Presidential Cuvee ($9) is a classical blending of 85% Semillon with 15% 
Sauvignon Blanc. On the label of this limited release is a portrait of 
President Bush by James-Paul Brown that was commissioned for the Inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
The Semillon is fermented in stainless steel to preserve its fresh fruitiness, 
and the Sauvignon Blanc is barrel-fermented in French oak, with nine months on 
the yeast lees. This young wine, which has refreshing hints of lemon, shows an 
inviting complexity that makes it a chilled aperitif of considerable 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
Even more recently, the winery added to its reputation when its 1987 San Luis 
Obispo Chardonnay ($12) fared better in a blind tasting than the more 
well-known and slightly more expensive Sterling Vineyard 1987 Napa Valley 
Chardonnay. The tasting was conducted by Rod Smith of the San Francisco 
Chronicle. Of the six wines they sampled, the tasters, who included a wine 
market analyst, a wine buyer and a chef, voted Creston Manor No. 1. Its wine, 
the panel said, was "a beautifully balanced, tightly structured Chardonnay in 
the French style." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for Larry Rosenbloom, a Beverly Hills insurance agent turned vintner in 
1982. Creston Manor received its first gold medals for its Sauvignon Blanc that 
year and has continued to win for every vintage edition that wine maker Vic 
Roberts produces. The 1987 San Luis Obispo Sauvignon Blanc ($8.25), fermented 
and aged in Nevers and Limousin oak, with "taming" additions of Semillon, is 
one of California's best, not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
The winery's companion to its 1987 Chardonnay, which won the taste test, is its 
1985 Cabernet Sauvignon-Winemaker's Selection ($16.50). Composed of 90% 
Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, and aged in the barrel for 27 months before 
bottling, the wine is ready to enjoy now. It has a satin smoothness and 
harmonious finish. 
</P>
<P>
Like a great number of California wineries, Creston Manor also makes Beaujolais 
Nouveau, but it became the first in the state to use the elegant Pinot Noir 
grapes instead of the traditional California variants of Gamay. The bouquet of 
the Creston Manor nouveau is almost floral, and the taste suggests that of rose 
petals. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' stylish original, while forsaking the traditional Gamay, submitted the 
Pinot Noir grapes to the classic carbonic maceration method in which whole 
clusters are placed in open fermenters. This procedure produces a wine of 
intense jewel color, but with no tannic bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the wine is cold-settled, racked, gently filtered, bottled and 
labeled. It is ready for the market within 60 days of harvest -- in time for 
the nouveau madness. Although Creston Manor 1988 Petit d'Noir ($8) is ready to 
drink right after it is bottled, it will develop gracefully for two to three 
years, unlike other nouveaus.

GARDENS: SHADY CHARACTERS;

<P>
SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE PROBLEM OF DARKNESS IN THE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Robert Smaus is an associate editor of Los Angeles Times 
Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALL GARDENS have what seem to be impossible places: too dark, too small, or 
both. This tiny sliver of land on Lido Isle in Newport Bay seldom sees the sun 
and is too narrow for any grand scheme, but it proves that almost any space has 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a dark location, such as under a dense tree, which is a shade more 
difficult. Here, a substantial patch of open sky (but no direct sun) gives 
enough light to grow a number of things. And the plants chosen here are among 
the best for shady places. 
</P>
<P>
The basic ground covering, baby's tears, grows where few other ground covers 
can. Even in dense shade it is an aggressive spreader. Poking out of the sea of 
baby's tears are two companions that can successfully compete with it. 
Impatiens add nearly year-round flowers to the scheme; bronze-leaved ajuga 
supplies handsome, contrasting foliage (and short blue spires in spring). The 
ajuga is important to the design, breaking up the green monotony and seeming to 
point the way to the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
The shrub with the maple-like leaves is an abutilon, also tolerant of shade and 
capable of outgrowing this spot. However, Roger's Gardens Colorscape in Corona 
del Mar, designers of this slice of garden, has found that abutilons can be 
pruned to practically nothing and rebound in a few months time, looking all the 
better for it. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston ivy, clinging to the wall, will grow in complete shade. It can, in 
fact, completely cover the side of a house and must be pruned away from windows 
and doors. It is one of the few vines that attaches itself, clinging with 
little suckers that stay attached, even when the vine is removed from the wall. 
But as compensation for that annoyance, the ivy becomes a hedge-like wall of 
green that turns orange and red in the fall just before the leaves drop. Even 
after that -- in winter -- it makes a fine tracery against the wall, adding 
dimension to the design.

<P>
Is pursuing one's own "needs" more important than "subjecting our children to 
an experiment" in child care that may fail? 
</P>
<P>
What choices do these middle- to upper-class moms have? Working part time, job 
sharing, working in the home, altering (lowering) one's life style are all 
viable considerations. There are so many homes that "look so much like the 
American dream" filled with children being raised by strangers.

It is interesting that there is no mention at all of any of the Anglo fathers 
in this article. Could it be that they are so uncomfortable with the 
servant/nanny/ housekeeper/ baby-sitter that they have chosen to distance 
themselves from the whole thing and left their overburdened wives to deal with 
la situacion? If this is indeed an experiment in child rearing, when, how and 
by whom will the results be judged?

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: WAGE INFLATION BECOMING MORE THAN A BAD DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting next to me is Hugh R. LaZee, the only person in America without a job. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Hugh, how long do you think you can hold out before going to work? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: John, it's getting pretty tough to turn down some of the offers I've 
received. You know, I'm 45 and I don't have any skills or ambition, but heck, 
these companies are making it pretty hard for me to keep saying no. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of offers have you received? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, several fast-food joints want to pay me $10 an hour to put those 
little pickles on their burgers, $10.50 if I'll also handle the ketchup. And 
one wants to make me a manager at twice that. But I think I'd like to become a 
nuclear engineer instead. I'm told that's where the real big bucks are. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Brilliant Burgers isn't paying the minimum wage anymore? 
</P>
<P>
A: Where you been? This is 1991. Nobody makes the minimum anymore. Even 
journalists must be doing better than that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Yeah, some. 
</P>
<P>
While this 1991 scene might seem like worker heaven, today it's actually 
considered one of the worst things that could possibly happen to this country's 
economy. Call it the inflation fighters' nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
And it is this very nightmare that is keeping investment professionals from 
sleeping soundly the night before the government releases its monthly 
employment figures. 
</P>
<P>
There will never be full employment in this country, not in the sense that the 
nation has run out of people looking for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, experts suspect that "full employment" these days actually means an 
unemployment rate of 5%. And that's exactly where the U.S. civilian 
unemployment rate was in March -- its lowest monthly level in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to government figures released earlier this month, there were 180,000 
additional jobs created in March. That figure would have been a more bothersome 
205,000 new jobs if the growth hadn't been offset by the fact that 25,000 
airline workers went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The tightness in the labor market is currently generating stronger wage 
inflation than we've had in the last five years," says John Hagens, an 
economist with WEFA Group of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. He predicts that the inflation 
rate will be 5% this year, one percentage point above what is considered by 
many experts to be a natural and acceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, investors will hear the drum roll each time the employment figures 
are due. Experts say a critical point has arrived. If the rate of unemployment 
continues to go down and new jobs are created at the same brisk pace, the 
Federal Reserve Board could panic and send interest rates shooting up. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts, including Hagens, are predicting that the economy will slow down 
over the next few months, resulting in a jump in the unemployment rate to about 
6% by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
But on the employment front line, experts say they don't see any signs of a 
slowdown. James E. Challenger, head of the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas 
outplacement service, says his clients are having little trouble finding new 
jobs. And even older workers are in strong demand. "Our clients, in the last 
quarter, got jobs in 3.03 months. And that's fast," says Challenger. The normal 
period between jobs is 3.2 months. "We're in a very good hiring period," 
Challenger adds. 
</P>
<P>
The same strong demand for workers is apparently being felt on college 
campuses. Victor R. Lindquist, head of Northwestern University's Placement 
Center and director of the Lindquist-Endicott Report, says college kids haven't 
had it this good in years. 
</P>
<P>
"Salaries are up, job opportunities are going up and recruiting on campus is 
up," says Lindquist, whose survey dates back to 1945. Overall the job market 
for college graduates is 8% stronger this year than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And CV magazine, which is geared toward college students, said a job fair that 
it held last week in Boston was strongly attended by corporations looking to 
fill positions. Marian Salzman, president of New York-based CareerVision, which 
publishes the magazine, says: "This year is the first year of a seller's 
market, where college graduates are in a better position than in recent years 
to pick and choose among employers." 
</P>
<P>
Where is this all heading? "Obviously," says Charles Lieberman, head of 
Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.'s financial markets research, "at some 
point we run out of workers." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Lieberman says, people -- including retirees and those who've voluntarily 
left or never entered the labor force -- will have to be lured by generous 
salaries. That generosity will result in higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is to slow down economic growth to a sustainable point," says 
Lieberman. The country, he says, seems able to absorb 1.8 million new jobs a 
year without aggravating inflation, but not the 2.4 million new jobs now being 
created. 
</P>
<P>
Experts admit that they really don't know where the crisis point is for the 
labor markets and inflation. Most, in fact, contend that labor force-induced 
inflation -- like the United States had in 1979 -- is the kind of problem that 
creeps up gradually rather than appearing in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
Says Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets: "It 
works more like a dimmer switch than a light switch." 
</P>
<P>
A management training company called Motivational Systems in West Orange, N.J., 
estimates that as many as 25 million American workers would quit their jobs if 
they didn't feel appreciated. In a survey, the company asked workers if they 
would leave their present company for a similarly paying job at a company with 
a reputation for giving recognition and praise. Twenty-seven percent of the 
1,020 people surveyed said they would . . .

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / GEORGE L. PERRY: YOU REALLY CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE L. PERRY, GEORGE L. PERRY is a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution research organization in Washington.

<P>
When economic problems get difficult, Fed-bashing becomes popular. The actions 
and statements of the Federal Reserve Board chairman are scrutinized and 
second-guessed not only by the financial community and press, but also by the 
White House and Congress. Because of this, the ability to take the heat is one 
of the more important qualities a Fed chairman must have. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from any or all of these quarters provides a useful safeguard against 
Fed policies that may occasionally be misguided or inconsistent with the aims 
of elected officials. Often, however, the Fed is criticized not because it is 
plainly wrong, foolish or acts contrary to the will of the people, but because 
others have political motives or are themselves misguided about the economic 
risks or about what the Fed can accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
There are many dimensions to good economic performance. The Fed has the 
unenviable task of trying to do well on all counts even though it has only one 
reliable instrument of policy with which to operate. It can raise or lower 
short-term interest rates -- by adding or removing reserves from the banking 
system. When it moves interest rates, it will affect the economy in many ways, 
not all good. 
</P>
<P>
Its most obvious conflict is between goals for real growth of output and 
employment on the one hand and inflation on the other. Everybody wants strong 
growth in output and employment. Lower interest rates help promote these goals. 
But under some circumstances, faster growth brings more inflation -- if not 
now, then down the road a bit -- and the Fed always worries about more 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when falling oil prices helped bring inflation as measured by the 
consumer price index down to only 1%, the inflation rate has been creeping up. 
At the same time, growth in real output has been brisk, reducing the 
unemployment rate to near 5%. The Fed has reacted by gradually raising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, some have already been criticizing this Fed policy. Early in the 
year, there were even hints of a rift between the Fed and the new 
Administration over it. In estimating the budget deficit for next year, the 
Bush Administration has projected a strong expansion in the economy together 
with much lower interest rates. The Fed's policy would add to the estimated 
deficit both by producing slower growth and by raising interest expenditures on 
the national debt. The incipient rift was quickly put to rest by Administration 
officials, but the issue could reemerge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, markets and other Fed watchers react to each new straw in the 
economic wind. Most recently, the economic statistics have become mixed. When 
the monthly price statistics worsen, as they did when average producer prices 
recently rose 1% in a month, financial markets react on the assumption that the 
Fed will raise interest rates. At the same time, critics who fear inflation 
complain that the Fed has not raised rates soon enough or high enough. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, after statistics reveal that the economy is slowing, as they 
have for the past few weeks, critics begin saying that the Fed has tightened so 
much that a recession is on the way, and financial markets react on the 
assumption that interest rates will fall before long. 
</P>
<P>
But financial markets and critics reflect what may be too optimistic a view of 
what the Fed can accomplish. It may well be that slowing the expansion will 
still not slow inflation. In most past business cycles, inflation did not 
ratchet down until the economy went into recession. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to improve on that experience, the Fed -- first under Paul A. Volcker 
and now under Alan Greenspan -- has tried to assure the world that it would 
allow only as much growth as was consistent with no acceleration of inflation. 
The idea was to influence the expectations of markets about inflation and, 
through those expectations, to moderate actual price and wage behavior and so 
keep inflation from rising. Whether this hope will be fulfilled remains to be 
seen. But there is as yet no evidence that we have broken the old cyclical link 
between lower unemployment and higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
This conflict between spurring output and slowing inflation has only begun to 
emerge in the present economic cycle. The genuine dilemma for the Fed will come 
if inflation does not come down even after the economic expansion has slowed 
and an actual economic recession becomes a clear risk. That may be the 
situation before the year is over. If it is, the Fed may well see its 
responsibilities differently than the general public, most politicians and the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the decade, Volcker's Fed caused a massive and prolonged 
recession in order to stop an inflation that had reached double-digit rates. 
Criticism of that policy was remarkably muted, largely because inflation was an 
overriding concern, and the painful medicine was accepted as inevitable. Today, 
high inflation is a fairly distant memory and there is little appetite for a 
recession. Indeed, the financial fragility and indebtedness that has built up 
in banks and corporations over the years of President Ronald Reagan provides 
added reasons for fearing high interest rates and the recession they would 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
Today we know that the fear of inflation will loom larger in the Fed's thinking 
than in the thinking of politicians or the public at large. Because of that, 
and despite the costs of recession, the Fed may one day decide that it must 
raise interest rates much further out of fear that, if it does not, inflation 
will get continuously, if gradually, worse. That is when the capacity of 
Chairman Greenspan to take the heat will be sorely tested. And, if it comes to 
that, it will be hard to render a verdict on whether the Fed is right or wrong. 
The world may simply offer unattractive choices.

HMO MEMBERS FIND QUALITY OF PROGRAMS MUCH SUPERIOR TO TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his March 26 Viewpoints column, "HMOs Are Far From DOA: Despite Their 
Numerous Problems, Health Maintenance Organizations Are Here to Stay," Dr. 
Brant S. Mittler used scare tactics in another attempt to influence public 
opinion against HMOs. This time, he is "warning" that many people may be 
encouraged to join an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
Survey after survey indicates that HMO members find the coverage, cost and 
quality of care preferable to the fee-for-service system. Members give their 
HMOs high marks for the caring attitude of the physicians, availability of 
appointments at short notice and the extent of their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers continue to find the quality of care in prepaid plans as 
good if not better than fee-for-service practice, whether the coverage is 
employer-based, Medicare or Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
After his "chilling" opening statement, Mittler suggests that HMOs have failed 
to stem the tide of rising health-care costs. Apparently he doesn't know that 
the approach to medicine introduced by HMOs saves the health system millions, 
perhaps billions, of dollars each year. While HMOs and indemnity insurers are 
subject to the same steep rises in hospital costs and salaries, HMO premium 
increases are consistently lower. But HMOs account for 13% of the market. They 
cannot be expected to cure the ills of the 87% they do not yet cover. 
</P>
<P>
Mittler cites the old chestnut about younger, healthier employees joining HMOs, 
while older, sicker workers stay with traditional insurance and increase the 
costs. Sophisticated observers know this doesn't make sense. Ask employers 
where their health dollars go. As studies have shown, a disproportionate number 
of health-care dollars go -- and should go -- to prenatal and neonatal care, 
both areas where HMOs provide top-of-the-line coverage. 
</P>
<P>
More important is the HMO offering of comprehensive benefits while employers 
continue to cut reimbursement for services through dramatically increased 
co-payments and deductibles.

Thomas M. Berry needed big money in a bad way. 
</P>
<P>
An official of a railway workers union in Chicago, Berry watched in 1987 and 
1988 as the Chicago &amp; North Western railroad sold off rail lines and tried 
to eliminate hundreds of union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, he and some fellow union members decided to try to buy part of the 
railroad to protect the jobs and run the line themselves. But no conventional 
bank would provide the financing. 
</P>
<P>
So, Berry said, an investment banker put him in touch with Otis Cheerful Canupp 
of Tucson, Ariz., chief executive of Regal Bank of Montserrat, a tiny Caribbean 
island. 
</P>
<P>
Regal's financial statements showed assets of $2 billion. The bank's license 
application in Montserrat listed assets of $51 billion, according to court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
And Berry said Canupp was very accommodating, promising to lend the union the 
money it needed. But Berry said Canupp told him that the bank needed an advance 
fee of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
Federal labor law prohibited using union money for the fee. So Berry withdrew 
his life savings and borrowed some more to come up with the money. Last Nov. 3, 
he sent a cashier's check for $55,000 to Canupp. He has been waiting for his 
loan ever since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Personal Expenses 
</P>
<P>
"We're against the wall now, but I still haven't given up," Berry said in a 
telephone interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law enforcement official said at least seven other people paid 
$55,000 each to Regal Bank in recent months for loans they have yet to receive. 
</P>
<P>
An affidavit prepared by FBI agent Robert M. Keefe for a search of Canupp's 
Tucson office last month said Berry's money was used to pay personal expenses 
for Canupp and some associates, including department store charge accounts. The 
affidavit said Canupp admitted to Keefe in February that the bank's entire 
assets consisted of stock in a defunct mining company. 
</P>
<P>
Regal Bank, which was not chartered by WFI Corp., is one of the Montserrat 
banks now under investigation by Scotland Yard, according to the island's 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is also investigating the bank, according to Keefe's affidavit. Along 
with the alleged advance-fee schemes, the Keefe affidavit said Otis Canupp told 
undercover federal agents that he could launder drug money and help them 
acquire illegal weapons, all through his bank. 
</P>
<P>
Canupp and his mother, Alberta, were jailed briefly in Montserrat last month on 
charges of conspiring to defraud the island government. Free on bail, they are 
restricted to the island and awaiting a hearing in June. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta Canupp said in a telephone interview that she and her son are innocent 
of any wrongdoing. She said they were unfair victims of the problems created by 
a few offshore banks and she said the loans had not been fulfilled because of 
"interference" by banking authorities. 
</P>

"Everybody is being lumped into one pot and everybody is being penalized," she 
said. DOUGLAS FRANTZ

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a conversation with reporters, put 
forth two approaches to East-West rela tions in Europe: The first encourages 
the Soviet Union to reduce progressively its political domination over Eastern 
Europe in return for negotiated assurances that the Atlantic Alliance would not 
move militarily beyond current dividing lines; the second deems negotiations 
unnecessary because the Soviet empire in Europe -- and perhaps the Soviet Union 
itself -- is disintegrating on its own. Baker, while expressing sympathy for 
the negotiated approach, seemed to imply that he could pursue both options in 
sequence with diplomacy needed only "if you had anarchy and a reaction by the 
Soviets. "

Matters might have rested on this essentially theoretical level had not the 
Baker remark evoked a flood of comments on both sides of the Atlantic, ranging 
from denunciation of any such negotiation as a second Yalta to arguments that 
Europeans, not Americans, should be the principal negotiators. I became 
involved in the debate because Baker at first seemed to endorse a fragmentary 
summary of a private conversation, a distorted version of which was then 
"rejected" by an unnamed Administration spokesman -- although it is far from 
clear precisely for whom this person spoke. 
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that the goal of U.S. policy should be the reversal of 
Yalta, not the revival of Yalta. The opportunity for this exists because of the 
increasing disillusionment of Eastern Europe, the policy of glasnost that makes 
it possible to articulate this unrest and perhaps a growing Soviet recognition 
that policing hostile populations drains resources from the imperatives of 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not possible to ease the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe without 
Moscow noticing; therefore the undoing of Yalta will surely be complex. The 
strategy should be to enable the countries of Eastern Europe to associate 
themselves -- on a case-by-case basis -- with the European Community while the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact continue at reduced 
levels in Central Europe. Existing forums could conduct the negotiations: The 
European Community would design the framework for its association with the 
countries of Eastern Europe; the Vienna talks on conventional arms control 
would provide a security framework for that process. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely because such an evolution requires difficult -- and, for the Soviet 
Union, painful -- adjustments, its direction must be understood by all key 
players. A confidential dialogue between Washington and Moscow will therefore 
be not only unavoidable but desirable. Its purpose should be conceptual: to 
clarify the goals and methodologies of the process of unifying Europe. The 
European Community would participate as an integral partner. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, if the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe is disintegrating, diplomacy 
might be unnecessary. On the other hand, once there is anarchy and the tanks 
roll, it is too late for diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
In reality the policy of watchful waiting for the disintegration of Eastern 
Europe is a paper option: Western unity is unlikely to survive the process of 
coasting. Ironically, each of the alliances may be counting on the 
disintegration of the other. If both turn out to be wrong, there will be 
stagnation. If both turn out to be right, there will be chaos. If we are not 
careful, regional conflicts may be settled while the focal point of crises 
returns to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin's reliance on centrifugal tendencies in the West can be found in 
many pronouncements to the effect that Western unity will evaporate once the 
image of a common enemy has been removed. In that view the withdrawal of U.S. 
strategic forces from the continent of Europe under the Intermediate Nuclear 
Force agreement will weaken the link between the nuclear defense of Europe and 
America. As negotiations under the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks reduce 
overall numbers, recourse to strategic nuclear weapons based in America or at 
sea will seem less reliable or legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
The probable trend of conventional arms-control negotiations could accelerate 
the erosion of Western cohesion. The effort of elaborating an appropriate 
balance to offset Soviet proximity, central geographic location and mobilizable 
reserves and of inspecting for violations in the vast spaces of the Soviet 
Union will surely be divisive. More important, the process cannot go far 
without leading to a removal of some U.S. troops, a redeployment that will 
probably accelerate with the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of American troops has become so much a fixture in European minds 
that even their partial withdrawal will have a seriously adverse psychological 
impact. Europeans -- especially Germans -- may complain about low-level flights 
and other irritations. But a different reaction is likely to develop when it 
sinks in that the remaining NATO forces will be stretched so thin as to 
complicate the establishment of a credible defensive line against an adversary 
able to concentrate at a decisive point. This would hit home at the precise 
moment that the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear forces, combined with the reluctance 
of West Germany to modernize the remaining nuclear forces, was moving NATO 
toward a de facto denuclearization of CentralEurope. In this scenario, Eastern 
Europe would not be the only part of Europe facing ferment. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has put forward a formula to accelerate this ferment: the 
concept of the "Common European House" from the Urals to the Atlantic. Many 
European foreign ministers refer favorably to this idea even though it 
relegates the United States to a secondary status, establishes a Soviet claim 
to economic assistance based on geography and provides a basis for Soviet 
domination of a denuclearized Central Europe. Moscow knows that if its notion 
of a European House becomes conventional wisdom, the Alliance structure cannot 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
Two conclusions follow: a) arms-control negotiations can no longer carry the 
full weight of East-West relations; b) a political concept of a united Europe 
is needed to relate the existing separate negotiations on arms control, trade 
and human rights to one another. 
</P>
<P>
The West's internal cohesion requires it to put forward its vision of a united 
Europe, because without it the economically and militarily strongest nation of 
Europe -- the Federal Republic of Germany -- will surely pursue its own course. 
</P>
<P>
For the turmoil in Eastern Europe falls directly on the fault line of the 
division of Europe which cleaves the German people; no German statesman can 
afford passivity. Even in normal times, Germany has rarely found the means to 
reconcile the perils of its central geographic location with a sustainable 
concept of its own national interest. 
</P>
<P>
In part this is because Germany, unified only in 1871, never developed a 
coherent concept of the national interest. Except for the Bismarck period, 
1871-90, Germany's diplomacy was based on a restless quest for status which, by 
threatening each neighbor individually, brought about the very nightmare of 
hostile coalitions it dreaded. Historically, Germany's ties were either in 
Central Europe with the Austro-Hungarian Empire or in the east with Russia. It 
was not until 1950 that a decision in favor of the West was made. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade and a half that choice has been increasingly challenged. The 
truism of the postwar period -- that the United States was essential to balance 
a genuine Soviet menace -- has been shaken at both ends. U.S. policy has come 
to appear opaque and less steady. The Soviet threat has diminished in West 
German eyes; Mikhail S. Gorbachev has in fact turned into a sort of West German 
folk hero. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of West Germany do it no favor by muting a disquiet many Allied leaders 
feel but are reluctant to articulate. It is impossible to travel through Europe 
without becoming conscious of the concern of influential Europeans, not that 
West Germany will leave the alliance, but that by pursuing all its options 
between East and West simultaneously it will repeat -- with the best of 
intentions -- the historic German debacle of self-isolation. Restless German 
unilateralism could thus wind up splitting either Europe or NATO or both. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany cannot by itself provide the necessary framework for healing the 
split of Europe. If the Federal Republic challenges the Soviet Union in Eastern 
Europe on a national basis, it would revive historic nightmares for the Soviet 
Union and tempt Moscow into a demonstration of strength, perhaps over Berlin. 
But if West Germany sought to avoid this danger by ever closer rapprochement 
with Moscow -- as it would be tempted to do -- it would lead to a cooling of 
relations with Washington. Bonn, in trying to be popular everywhere, could wind 
up forfeiting its hard-earned reputation for reliability. 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, a reassessment of Allied purposes and relationships and the 
elaboration of a coherent strategy are essential. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Atlantic Allies must put forward their own concept of a united 
Europe. If the Soviet Union participated without the United States, it would 
dominate. If both the United States and the Soviet Union joined, Europe would 
lose its identity. To avoid both hegemony and to achieve identity, the borders 
of this new Europe must run from the Polish-Soviet frontier to the Atlantic, 
not from the Urals to the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Second, there must be a concept of how to achieve the goal of reuniting Europe. 
In the real world, progress can be made without the risk of war only if the 
political freedom of Eastern Europe is somehow related to meeting legitimate 
Soviet security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Neither America nor Europe can achieve this goal alone. The European Community 
must accelerate political unification while developing a strategy for the 
association of interested countries of Eastern Europe with its economic 
institutions. Eastern Europe should know that this association is available to 
any nation prepared to meet the Helsinki requirements of human rights and to 
make clearly defined progress toward democratic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Once the European Community has established such a political framework, NATO 
would be in a position to transform the conventional arms-control negotiations 
from an esoteric numbers game into a systematic effort to accelerate greater 
political freedom for Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The existing NATO arms-control proposal foresees the continued presence of U.S. 
and Soviet forces in Central Europe, albeit at reduced levels. This reflects 
the reality that no European government is prepared to see a complete 
withdrawal of U.S. forces, without which a total Soviet withdrawal cannot 
occur. (I doubt that the Soviets would accept even such an offer, nor could it 
be made without generating panic.) But to be compatible with greater political 
freedom for Eastern Europe, three limitations are necessary: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The principle of nonintervention into the domestic affairs of all 
participants must be established in binding international agreements; in other 
words, the Brezhnev Doctrine must be ended. 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. and Soviet troops should be confined to base areas except for a 
limited number of pre-announced maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Troops withdrawn from areas of limited armaments must not be reintroduced. 
</P>
<P>
Why should the Soviets agree to such an approach? They might do so if Soviet 
leaders are genuinely prepared to live in equilibrium with their neighbors. If 
Gorbachev wants to transcend the endless conflicts that have marred the history 
of his country, he should welcome an evolution that provides economic 
assistance and normal security guarantees in return for political freedom for 
nations whose restiveness would otherwise condemn the Soviet Union to policing 
endless, unforeseeable crises. 
</P>
<P>
In such an evolution Europe would restore its historic relationships. The 
Soviet Union would have a military buffer but Moscow would disembarrass itself 
of the costs and risks of sustaining unpopular regimes. The United States would 
continue as the guarantor of the security of its allies while they assume an 
increasing role in shaping their continent's political future. 
</P>
<P>
History will not do the work for us. But it has given the Atlantic nations an 
opportunity to do it for themselves.

BASEBALL PLAYERS: BOY-HEROES IN A CLOUDLESS SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, associate editor at the Pacific News 
Service, is the author of Hunger of Memory (Godine). 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The TV sportscaster -- blue blazer, orange hair, baritone -- is looking for 
evidence of damage the Pete Rose affair may have worked on the souls of the 
boys of Cincinnati. The series of childish interviews rolls on the screen, and, 
as if scripted from some classic American novel, several boys, shrugging, I 
dunno, I guess, describe disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Adults can be as disappointed as children when they see professional athletes 
strike for money or abandon teams to swim with sharks. But most of us, drinkers 
of coffee, readers of sports pages, are not unduly demoralized by tales of 
steroids or womanizing or gambling. A sportswriter friend, many years retired, 
dismisses the idea of sports heroes. "Athletes are an odd bunch -- and the 
worst of the worst are the baseball players -- the bus full of men, free from 
their wives and far from home for a summer." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless I think there are reasons why the boy's imagination is trained on 
the glamour of athletes. The kinship between a boy and a ballplayer is 
immediate and protracted because the ballplayer makes his living in the boy's 
world. If the athlete fails us as a moral hero because of his immaturity, that 
same immaturity is his entire glamour for the child. The athlete is subversive, 
at war with inevitability, which is the boy's inclination, too. 
</P>
<P>
The other day I was sitting next to a boy of 10 on an airplane. The boy in turn 
was sitting next to a man who said he had, a few years ago, been a boxer. 
During the course of the flight, the ex-boxer modestly described his athletic 
career to the boy. Then playfully -- but as irrefutable proof -- the ex-boxer 
formed a biceps under his suit jacket and offered it to the boy. The boy 
laughed, but he went for it. It would have been superstitiously wrong for the 
boy to have refused to connect with the touchstone of American virility. The 
biceps is the seat of comic virtue in America. Comic book heroes are true; they 
have no virtue beyond strength. 
</P>
<P>
The athlete is wonderful to the adult for being so uncomplicated. He 
exaggerates the mystery of childhood. The athlete is wonderful to the child for 
being so big. He minimizes the mystery of adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Dad is too complicated during those boyish years to count as a hero. Dad 
doesn't figure in the moral universe. Dad is substance -- unquestioned 
dad-ness. He has authority, a quarrelsome or a corny voice, a persona. The 
athlete-hero is sure to win by comparison, for the athlete is power and form. 
The athlete exists in the silent universe of pure performance. 
</P>
<P>
Moral authority attaches to the athlete by virtue of his body. The performance 
of his body is his perfection. Muscular, graceful, young -- these physical 
qualities represent spiritual qualities. It is an idea at least as old as the 
Greeks: Beauty is moral. For the child there is no more reliable iconography. 
</P>
<P>
In the second grade, in my Catholic school, the prevalent heresy among us was 
that Christ was the handsomest man who ever lived and the Virgin Mary the most 
beautiful woman. It was, at any rate, a heresy I shared with Renaissance 
painters. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that beauty is moral is not without a practical logic. The athletic 
body gives evidence of discipline, clear-minded effort, therefore spiritual 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Jackson regrets that black children have only athletes to look up to -- 
not a wide enough selection of role models, he says. Children, he says, need 
the examples of chemists and lawyers. But any kid will tell you that books are 
what you settle for if you can't make it athleticly. Kids are clear-eyed about 
such things. 
</P>
<P>
The sports hero reaches his apotheosis in high school with the crowning of the 
homecoming court. The election of senior class president marks some shift of 
power, the ascendancy of a more complicated hero. The sports letter remains 
important, equivalent to a war record, but there are new criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Most boys must give up the idea of excelling in sports by the time they go to 
college or join the army or get a job. We join the crowd of spectators. I 
remember first hearing athletes mocked in college. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy I was never romantic enough or easy enough in my body to fantasize an 
athletic future. I admired solitary sports -- boxing, long-distance running. 
The sports offered me were the conventional American triad of team sports. 
</P>
<P>
I was not then nor am I now oblivious to the romance of team sports and to the 
distinctly American charm of baseball -- that clubhouse world of hand-signals, 
hubba-hubba, backslapping and butt-touching. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was a cloudless sport, there were no shadows. There was no meanness, 
no villainy. Baseball was a contest of heroes. 
</P>
<P>
In adolescence, I moved away from any serious consideration of sports and of 
heroes. But baseball still belongs in my mind with summer, with a lost languid 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Things change. Cynicism could not touch American boys during those long summers 
before we felt ourselves changing into men's bodies. Boys collected and traded 
baseball cards. Memorizing a system of history and myth and rite as complicated 
as the Trojan War, rehearsing it out loud in the furious pentameter of the 
sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, at a junior high near San Francisco, I was talking to some boys 
about heroes. Whom do you admire? Whose success? The names they lobbed belonged 
to rock musicians and athletes. The athletes were not held as heroes exactly. 
They were -- to use that morally vacuous term -- role models. That is, the boys 
wanted to be like a particular athlete only in that they wanted to be as 
famous, to drive an identical Porsche, to lure a beautiful girl. And they 
wanted to be rewarded for themselves -- for a natural talent. They didn't want 
to enter the world, they wanted to sit on top of the world. They wanted to 
remain unchanged. The sports hero doesn't change. He carries his talent with 
him. That's the beauty of him. That's the impossibility of him. He does not 
have to become an adult to be a star. 
</P>
<P>
On TV last year, during the playoffs, I remember seeing a baseball player in 
the dugout weeping. In a moment, I felt the full pathos of the game -- this 
twilight entertainment of boys in men's bodies where the stakes are real.

THE LOS ANGELES BRAND OF BIRACIAL COALITION POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Raphael J. Sonenshein, Raphael J. Sonenshein, an associate professor of 
political science at California State University, Fullerton, is completing a 
book on the Los Angeles biracial coalition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles voters last Tuesday wrote a surprising new chapter in the 
remarkable story of the city's biracial coalition -- which rather narrowly came 
together once again to reelect Mayor Tom Bradley to a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
The way Bradley's coalition was created and maintained tells us something about 
what is possible in the city's future. We might also be able to avoid the fate 
of cities like New York and Chicago, where the failure to build progressive 
coalitions led to electoral defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles politics is, by necessity, coalition politics. No single group has 
the numbers to win power by itself. Blacks constitute less than 17% of the 
city's population. While Latinos have increased, their low voter registration 
has made it hard to translate numbers into power. Jews, the most liberal white 
group in the city, do not exceed 7% of the population. There are even fewer 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley coalition grew out of two enduring Los Angeles realities. First, 
the black community is the most unified and consistently liberal in the city. 
Second, the white community is severely split along ideological lines. 
</P>
<P>
The two poles of Los Angeles politics have been the black community on the left 
and the conservative white community on the right. The fundamental differences 
between these two worlds constitute the roots of major city conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In each city election between 1965 and 1985, black districts and conservative 
San Fernando Valley districts have been on opposite sides. In Bradley's mayoral 
campaigns, and in his two races for governor, he attained his highest vote in 
the black community and his lowest in the northwest and central valley. 
</P>
<P>
The 5th Council District, now represented by Zev Yaroslavsky and about 
one-third Jewish, has been the home of white liberalism. It differs profoundly 
from conservative Valley districts in political choices. On the average, 
Yaroslavsky's district and the valley regions have been 20-30 percentage points 
apart on city, state and national elections; these differences have marked 
Bradley's mayoral and gubernatorial races. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Bradley coalition has been the linkage between two liberalisms, 
black and white. The coalition that eventually took city hall away from Sam 
Yorty in 1973 had its roots in the 1963 campaign to elect Bradley as 10th 
District councilman. In that multiracial district with large black and Jewish 
communities, black activists joined forces with Jewish liberal reformers. 
Bradley's biracial organization, led by black and Jewish activists, provided 
the model and key personnel for the government to come. Ten years later, blacks 
and white liberals, long shut out of citywide power, gained control of city 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
What held this part of the coalition together? We have heard much about 
Bradley's personality and symbolic appeals. Both are important, but it should 
also be understood that Bradley and his black and liberal allies have used 
specific coalition techniques. Black activists led by Bradley openly rejected 
anti-Semitism, and white liberal activists paid respect to the independent 
political role of the black community. When conflicts arose between blacks and 
Jews, Bradley associates often called closed-door meetings to air differences 
and forge unity. It was no accident at all, but rather the careful application 
of such coalition techniques, that allowed Los Angeles to avoid the interracial 
tensions devastating to coalitions in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond this biracial base, the coalition expanded to incorporate downtown 
business and the Latino community. Latinos joined late, having backed Yorty in 
1969. But in successive elections, their support for the liberal regime 
increased steadily. Bradley's downtown redevelopment programs brought him 
unswerving business support and established a key role for business in the 
regime. Thus a black-Jewish alliance expanded into a minority- liberal-business 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
This center-left coalition has pursued policies of moderate liberalism, 
including affirmative action in city hiring, greater civilian control over the 
police, extensive federal aid (before the onset of the Reagan presidency) and 
downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, 1981 and 1985 liberal politicians calculated the odds of facing 
Bradley and decided not to run. So did the strongest conservatives. Bradley 
then faced and outgunned weaker conservative opponents and won easily. But the 
same script did not play all the way out this year. For the first time since 
Jesse Unruh ran in the 1973 mayoral primary, Bradley faced direct competition 
for his liberal base. He lost votes not just on the right, which was normal, 
but in the liberal Westside and in the Central City, while being hurt by the 
apathy of his own supporters. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden and former Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter 
Ward together exceeded Bradley's vote in the conservative white Valley 
districts. Bradley's base was the same as usual: minority districts added to 
the white liberal 5th District. The 5th was the only white majority district 
where Bradley exceeded 50%. Fortunately for the mayor, a contested council race 
in the 5th brought a comparatively massive turnout. But, like Unruh in 1973, 
Holden cut into Bradley's support in each of these areas. Bradley's normal 
85%-90% range in the three main black districts fell toward 70%; his usual 
65%-70% in the 5th dropped to 51.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly all is not well in the dominant coalition. Bradley's 52% showing 
certainly was a major shock. But in terms of coalition evolution, the shifting 
pattern is not unexpected. A majority coalition of the center and the left is 
likely to be highly popular with the majority of voters, but over time will 
have growing problems with the activists who provide the energy and sharp edge 
to politics. When a coalition becomes too big and cautious, it becomes an 
inviting target for dissension from within. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for progressives in Los Angeles today is quite different from that 
facing Bradley and his allies in 1973. Liberalism was newly emergent then and 
had just barely won over a long-dominant conservatism. Now, liberalism is a 
stable regime, whose power is taken for granted. But the examples of Chicago 
and New York City tell us that liberal power can collapse, and when it does, it 
will happen from within. If a center-left coalition divides down the middle, 
the winner will be a resurgent conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
The air is filled with new ideas, and we see new activists everywhere. Many 
groups now seek a greater role in the city's progressive politics: blacks, 
Westside liberals, Latinos, Asians and women. Seeking to establish new city 
policies, they may be less interested in building coalitions. On the other 
hand, those who seek to maintain existing coalitions may have difficulty 
creating new policies. The future of progressive politics in Los Angeles can 
only be assured if one of two things happens: new activists learn to build 
coalitions, or existing leaders develop new policies. 
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to agree with all of Bradley's policies in order to see the 
necessity of learning from the model of coalition politics his experience 
offers. It is only necessary to be concerned about the future of progressive 
politics in the city. While new sorts of policies may be desirable, it will be 
impossible to implement any of them without a successful strategy for winning 
and holding power. 
</P>
<P>
Once lost, power is hard to recover. Coalitions succeed when leaders hold the 
loyalty of their own group while reaching out to others. The reward is 
electoral victory, and the opportunity to bring about social change.

NEW LESSONS AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week a bucolic corner of the Stanford University campus produced one 
rather commonplace lesson: Never throw anything away just because it is not 
absolutely up to date. From that, though, will flow cosmic lessons almost 
beyond the imagining of ordinary folk, let alone their comprehension. As Burton 
Richter, director of Stanford's Linear Accelerator Center, puts it, what comes 
next will help scientists who are "trying to understand what's in the mind of 
God." 
</P>
<P>
The something not quite up to date is the 20-year-old accelerator, which 
Richter and a team of scientists modified for $115 million -- peanuts in the 
big-science business where people think in billions -- by adding a loop to the 
end of an existing 2-mile-long tunnel through which sub-atomic particles ride 
waves of electric power. The accelerator now sends positrons into the loop in 
one direction and electrons in the other so that they collide at nearly the 
speed of light. The nuclear debris from what used to be called atom-smashing is 
scattered into a big concrete pillbox packed with instruments that sort out and 
identify the bits and pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic aspect stems from the fact that after two anxious years of trying to 
calibrate the modified atom-smasher, Stanford's instruments detected a Z 
particle in the debris Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Z particle is what Richter and his colleagues had been looking for. With 
the tricky business of calibration apparently solved, according to spokesman 
Michael Riordan, Stanford may become the world's largest supplier of Z 
particles by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Z particles important to physicists is that they existed 
naturally for about one-trillionth of a second after the Big Bang that 
scientific theory says created the universe, and then they decayed. By creating 
Zs in a collider and observing the artificial particles decay, physicists can 
add one more level to what they know about how and why our galaxy and other 
galaxies arranged themselves as they did. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a crucial step toward what Sidney Drell, co-director of the 
accelerator center, calls the Holy Grail of physics, a grand unifying theory 
that would explain the relationship between gravity and electromagnetism. 
</P>

Stanford's Z is not the first ever trapped in an atom-smasher. The first was 
detected six years ago in the collider of the European Center for Nuclear 
Research near Geneva by a team of researchers who were awarded the Nobel prize 
for physics for their effort. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford may become the first mass producer of the heaviest sub-atomic 
particle now known to exist, the one that may hold the key to understanding 
how, in a trillionth of a second, the pattern was set for everything that 
exists billions of years later. It is good to see California again on the 
cutting edge of science. But the real cause for celebration is one more lesson 
wrung from science, one more lesson that compels us to ponder once more the 
wonders of physical discovery, discovery with the power to make the mind both 
wince and dance.

The great thing about democracy is that we pretty much deserve what we get. 
Ronald Reagan and his string-pullers didn't make any secret about the fact that 
they believed in lower taxes for the rich. Now is not the time for those of us 
in the middle who have to make up the shortfall to scream and rend our 
clothing. After all, we are the very ones who put him there -- not once but 
twice -- and then elected his veep for yet another four years!

Have no pity, George -- sock it to us.

NANCY REAGAN AT DRUG RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As it is bound to happen again, please consider these simple pointers as to 
what readers of The Times consider vital details in coverage of designer drug 
raids: temperature setting of the air conditioner in the motor home; country of 
export of the grapes; activity which kept Nancy on her feet all day; social 
significance of watermelon in a controlled environment. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that Mark Weinberg, the Reagans' press secretary, was 
disappointed.

NANCY REAGAN AT DRUG RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So this is what drug control has come to! A publicity-avaricious female with 
"Nancy" scrolled across the front of her jacket and a politically ambitious 
police chief grinning at us! 
</P>
<P>
This is not even to mention the taxpayers' dollars spent on the 
"air-conditioned motor home parked beside the alleged rock house" which "had 
been ordered up for Mrs. Reagan's comfort because 'she's been on her feet all 
day,' " and to which she could repair with her police chief host to munch fruit 
salad. A regular high-society party! 
</P>
<P>
Has she no shame, being the focal point of this kind of egocentric carrying on? 
Has Gates no shame using this tragic comedy to what he thinks is going to be a 
governorship? (I have news for him!) Have you no shame for printing it? And 
have I no shame for reading it?

NANCY REAGAN AT DRUG RAID

<P>
I'm really steamed! 
</P>
<P>
What a photo opportunity; Nancy Reagan in South-Central Los Angeles at one of 
Police Chief Daryl Gates' famous drug raids (Metro, April 7-8). 
</P>
<P>
In an interview she uttered the standard platitudes about "empty lives," and a 
real corker, "Maybe they could have been helped years ago." Yeah, maybe at 
about the time that her husband was sacking and burning federal aid to 
education. Or maybe when he cut the job training programs. Better yet, I'll 
wager they could really have been helped when he was cutting funds to fight 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy, stay in Beverly Hills, or go down to Reagan country in Orange County. 
The big drug money is spent by the rich and famous who don't have to worry 
about police raids. 
</P>
<P>
Tell them to just say no.

As I write my check to the IRS, I'm reflecting on the bills it will pay to keep 
our country going. I feel good about contributing to education, housing, health 
care, and saving the environment. But that just adds up to 14 cents of my tax 
dollar. My hair stands straight on end when I think about 52 cents of that 
dollar going into military budgets. Wouldn't we, in the end, be a stronger and 
better nation if we could turn those figures around?

THE COMPETITIVE PULL TO NATIONAL HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE IACOCCA, Lee Iacocca is the chairman of Chrysler Corp. and writes a 
syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, any red-blooded American business leader caught even whispering 
the notion of national health insurance would have been asked to turn in his 
pinstripe suit. And, of course, the medical Establishment saw any greater 
government role in health care as the possible end of Western Civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Well, don't look now, but there's a big crack in the dike. More and more 
business people are not just whispering but talking out loud about making 
health-care financing a government responsibility. And the prestigious New 
England Journal of Medicine, which had never before supported national health 
insurance, said in January that maybe it's time to try something new. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not ready to turn over all the responsibility for health-care financing to 
Washington, but the reason the idea is getting more attention is simple. We've 
waged a war on health-care costs for more than 10 years and lost it. Those 
costs have gone up year after year at almost double the rate of inflation, and 
they now account for about $550 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the only major country without some kind of national 
health-financing program, our per-capita health bill is 41% higher than 
Canada's, 61% higher than Sweden's, 85% more than France's, 131% more than 
Japan's and a whopping 171% above Britain's. 
</P>
<P>
Our life expectancy is no better than the rest of the industrialized world, our 
infant mortality rate is one of the worst, and we have 37 million people 
without any health coverage at all. 
</P>
<P>
For businessmen like me, the issue is competitiveness. Health costs have become 
a major drain on America's ability to compete in the world. 
</P>
<P>
That's because American business pays a substantial part of the cost of our 
overpriced system. Those costs go directly into the price of our goods, and 
that has the effect of an export tax when we try to sell abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of my company, more than $700 of the cost of producing a vehicle in 
the United States goes to pay for health care for employees, retirees and their 
families. But we have plants in Canada, too, and there our cost is only $223 a 
car. So, most of our foreign competitors have a $300- to $500-cost advantage 
over us just in health costs alone for every car and truck they build. 
</P>
<P>
And the gap doesn't go away when a foreign company builds a plant here, because 
there are no retirees to cover and the new work force is always younger, and 
therefore, healthier. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has an aggressive cost-containment program that has probably saved the 
company more than $1.3 billion since 1981. But even with that, our health costs 
have grown at the rate of 8.5% a year. (For American industry as a whole, it's 
been more than 16%.) 
</P>
<P>
So the "unmentionable" is getting mentioned in business circles: Maybe we 
should learn about the national health-care systems in Europe and Japan, and 
design one for the United States. For any program to work, of course, 
government, management and labor would have to come together. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a comfortable thought, however; the idea of turning over the job of 
financing health care to a government that hasn't balanced a budget in 20 years 
and which is already spending a half billion dollars a day more than it takes 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Still, other countries do it. But they also have some strict rules and we'd 
need to adopt them to avoid bankrupting the country. A major reason our health 
costs are wildly out of control is that many Americans are able to demand more 
health-care services than they need. Every national system has to discipline 
itself. That means denying some services that people may feel they're entitled 
to. So would we, and a lot of people wouldn't like it. But the competitive 
pressures to try something different are building. 
</P>
<P>
The last big push for national health insurance came in the late '70s, and it 
was shut off by the so-called "voluntary effort." That was the private 
commitment by doctors, hospitals, insurers, employers, unions and everybody 
else involved to curb rising health costs. Thousands of cost-containment 
programs were created. No doubt they helped, but one look at the cost figures 
tells us they've barely made a dent. 
</P>
<P>
National health insurance would be a huge risk, given our lousy record in this 
country of federal financing of social services. If it isn't done intelligently 
and with discipline, it could be an absolute disaster. But we're already 
running a big risk with a system that is wasting billions of dollars a year, 
that isn't buying us better health care and that is sapping America's 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is likely to heat up again, and this time some of the old opponents 
will at least be willing to listen.

ERMA BOMBECK: SERVICE -- UP CLOSE AND TOO PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
My husband and I went out for one of our rare "intimate" dinners the other 
night. As he leaned over and said, "You look nice in that dr. . . ," our waiter 
(Hal) interrupted with, "Could I get you something from the bar?" 
</P>
<P>
We ordered, and as I said, "So, tell me about. . . ," our waiter returned with 
the drinks and said, "Are you ready for menus?" We quickly made our decision 
and started to make small talk when Hal said, "Allow me to tell you about our 
specials." After he recited the litany, he said he would give us time to think 
about it. As I opened my mouth to share a bit of family gossip, he returned and 
asked if we were ready to order. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the meal, he appeared at our elbow, filling our water glasses, 
taking away excess silverware, replacing bread and asking us how we were 
enjoying our dinner. Once when I thought I was about to complete a sentence, he 
said: "Pardon me for interrupting, but could I tell you about our desserts?" 
</P>
<P>
Hal was clearly getting on our nerves. We had spent more time with him in one 
evening than with our kids over the last year. After he served dessert, he 
scraped crumbs off the tablecloth, served our coffee and said to let him know 
when we were ready for the check. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last we would ever see or hear Hal speak again. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know where waiters go with the checks. I only know that the same person 
who fawned over us like an anxious bridegroom on his wedding night suddenly 
dropped us like a bad habit. 
</P>
<P>
After 20 minutes of waiting for Hal to return with our check, I observed: "It's 
a strange time for him to start his vacation." 
</P>
<P>
"After all we've meant to one another, he could at least have said goodby," my 
husband said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should report him missing." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be gone for 48 hours. We have 46 to go." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, we thought we saw Hal dart from the kitchen and serve a table 
across the room, but we couldn't catch his eye. As we sat there waving our 
credit card and setting a small fire in the ashtray, it occurred to us that we 
had become invisible. 
</P>
<P>
Another 20 minutes passed. "Do you realize," my husband said, "that this is the 
first time all night we've been alone? I've been trying to tell you all night I 
like your dr. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Shut up and wave something," I said, "or we'll be here all night." 
</P>
<P>
I'm really worried about Hal. It's not as if he is a stranger to us. If you see 
him, give us a call. He's about 5-11, weighs about 155 pounds, has a mustache 
and our check.

ON VIEW: PASADENA SHOWCASE CLOAKED IN SECRECY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secrecy and suspense so surround the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee's 
25th Anniversary Premiere Night Party of the Pasadena Showcase House of Design 
that only party chairman Shirley Goldsmith, president Christina Varner and 
Brenda Owen, the anniversary benefit chairman, know the intricacies of the gala 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
We can tell you it's on a monumental scale with dancing planned until the wee 
hours. This year, says Linda Seiter, the committee goes to a reservation system 
for the Showcase public days next Sunday through May 21. That's because they 
couldn't control the flow of sometimes 53,000 people a year who come to the 
event in La Canada Flintridge. The phone number for reservations and tickets is 
(818) 792-4661, though reservations also are available through members, 
Ticketmaster outlets and the Music Center, P.O Box 1951, L.A. 90078. 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATION WEEKEND: Marlborough School's festivities for its many-faceted 
Centennial Celebration Weekend on April 28-30 are moving right along, said 
Centennial chairman Terry Von Hagen Bucher and co-chair Louise Trotti. Aileen 
Adams and Mary Adams Reinisch co-chair the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
That includes the Alumnae Luncheon, co-chaired by Nancy McCullough; a 
Marlborough "Then and Now" musical revue with a cast of students, alumnae, 
parents and friends; a day of seminars headed by Daryn Horton and Chris 
Westwater, and alumnae brunches co-chaired by Suzanne Crowell and Bonnie 
McClure. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight will be the Gala Celebration planned by Pamela Mullin and Barbara 
Myerson. It's April 29, black-tie, at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum. 
More involved are Carole Terry, Corki Clark, Joan Graves, Patti Doheny and 
Kacey McCoy (co-chairing a "Generations Tea"), Jane Warner, Laurie Stoneman, 
Susan Brant, Paulette Katzenbach, Cece Baise, Kay Gates, Michele Crahan, Carol 
King, Maggie Russell, Mary Morgan and Leah Coulter. 
</P>
<P>
EVER ONWARD: In 1983, opera diva Dorothy Kirsten French created the French 
Foundation for Alzheimer Research to seek advances in scientific and medical 
research and provide model methods for caring for America's 3 million 
Alzheimer's patients. The result, in five years: $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy's husband, Dr. John Douglas French, the brain surgeon who founded the 
UCLA Brain Research Institute, died recently of Alzheimer's. His spirit 
emboldens efforts on the foundation's fifth anniversary gala May 7 at the 
Beverly Hilton. Pia Zadora, Dudley Moore, Norm Crosby and composer Bill Conti 
will entertain. Alex Trebek, "Jeopardy!" host, will emcee. First Lady Barbara 
Bush, a member of the foundation's honorary board, has accepted to be honorary 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Roy Anderson, former chairman of Lockheed, serves as dinner 
chairman; Bonnie Green is Founding Associates chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the foundation joined with Richard K. Eamer, chairman and CEO of 
National Medical Enterprises, Inc., to open the John Douglas French Center for 
Alzheimer's Disease in Los Alamitos -- the first free-standing center devoted 
exclusively to the care of Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
VIPS: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling hosted the Blue Ribbon 200 
Presidents Club of United Way at a Clippers game at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena. (The prominent CEOs give to the United Way through the Alexis de 
Tocqueville Society, composed of donors who give more than $10,000.) Joining 
Sterling were United Way chairman Irwin S. Field, president Leo P. Cornelium, 
James P. Miscoll (1989-90 United Way campaign chairman) and Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
PRIME TIME: The Las Floristas Ball is set for Friday for its 51st Floral 
Headdress Ball at the Beverly Hilton. The ball, one of the first "specials" 
ever televised by early TV in Los Angeles (repeated for 25 years), becomes a 
salute to modern television. 
</P>
<P>
That calls for Michael King, head of King World, a TV syndication firm, to 
serve as honorary chairman. The evening begins with the guest headdress 
competition during the reception in the Grand Ballroom. Then Barbara Gershon, 
Las Floristas president, and Ball co-chairwomen Susanne Hall and Julie Lee will 
welcome guests including representatives of the Las Floristas Clinics for 
Handicapped Children, recipient of ball funds. 
</P>
<P>
Las Floristas models Cynthia Caswell, Jade Higgins, Carolyn Johnson, Madeline 
Viole, Mary Richardson, Jean Arnett, Barbara Robinson and Maggie Simms will 
wear the huge headdresses. 
</P>

ZAN THOMPSON: WHEN SWEET WORDS CATCH YOUR EAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have vexed a lady in Ventura on two counts. The first one I can wiggle out 
of. On the second, I will just flapdoodle around because she is right. 
</P>
<P>
It was the column that appeared on St. Patrick's Day. The lady's name is Elaine 
O'Brien, and she's probably a cousin because my paternal grandmother was named 
Bridget O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Elaine has ever been to Dromoland Castle, the centuries-old seat of 
the O'Briens. As you enter the castle, you walk down a long gallery with 
portraits of departed O'Briens. It gave me a start to see all those people 
looking like Aunt Sarah Cowan and Dennis O'Connor hanging, stern-visaged, on 
the wall. I wonder why portraits of that era are never of people smiling. Maybe 
it's hard to hold a smile while you're posing for an artist. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine objected to the headline on the column, which said, "Oh, to Be in 
Ireland on St. Paddy's Day." 
</P>
<P>
She writes, "When did this day become St. Paddy's Day? In New York, we always 
said St. Patrick's Day." 
</P>
<P>
And we do in Los Angeles, too, Elaine, if we are of Irish heritage. It is the 
day we pay honor to the patron saint and we do not give him a barroom nickname. 
But many people celebrate the day because it's fun and they say Paddy with 
affection, not disrespect. Although I, like New Yorkers, call the good green 
saint by his given name. 
</P>
<P>
And, Elaine, columnists do not write the headlines that run above their 
columns. This is done by the people on the View copy desk. These are 
wonderfully bright and quick people who have encyclopedic minds full of myth, 
fact and fancy. Not only do they write headlines, they read all the copy that 
goes into the section, mercifully catching errors and saving face for the 
writers. I promise you whoever wrote that headline meant no disrespect, nor 
would St. Patrick have fit in the space allotted for the headline. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the flapdoodle. Elaine says, "Your columns are always so blithe in 
spirit and meticulous in factual information that I have to call your attention 
to a real boo-boo. Caesar and the Romans never came to Ireland. They came to 
England, but not Ireland. As any Irishman will tell you, 'They didn't dare.' " 
</P>
<P>
Elaine, you are absolutely right. Caesar made his first crossing to Britain 
with two legions in 55 BC and made a landing on the coast of Kent. The second 
invasion took him clear across the Thames where a British prince with his war 
chariots nipped away at the Roman columns and Caesar went back to Gaul, which 
he immediately divided into three parts as every high school freshman taking 
Latin knows. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of the Romans' stay in England is wide: their aqueducts, bridges 
and all of those places ending in chester, which is from the Latin word, 
castro, or camp (unless Beverly Hills High School's Miss Edwards had it wrong, 
which would shake everything I trust). 
</P>
<P>
The Romans made no mention of invading Ireland, but in about the 3rd Century BC 
the Celts invaded and where those boys spat, no grass grew ever. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine O'Brien did not call me on describing Caesar as a "poor Italian 
gentleman, off on a fool's war." Italy did not exist in his time. I wrote it 
for the sound of it. "Roman gentleman" has the clanging sounds of legions 
marching, of battle flags flying and chariot wheels rolling. It is a phrase 
without pity or empathy. I meant no diminution of Italy, but giving Caesar's 
home territory its contemporary name brings him down to a more human size, a 
brave and resourceful, not very tall man with with a bowl haircut. 
</P>
<P>
I used the sentence for its sound, its cadence, and it was wrong. But as you 
might say about another monarch trying to fight a war hundreds of miles and 
oceans away from his supplies, "Poor old George III fighting a fool's war 
against a rag-tag army of farmers and woodsmen with balky muskets and not 
enough ammunition." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, George never left the comforts of the court and nice, domestic Queen 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
That, Elaine, is flapdoodle. It is also a rationale as full of holes as a 
honeycomb. I used the phrase because I liked its sound, which is a precarious 
procedure especially when nice people like Elaine expect "factual information" 
from me. 
</P>
<P>
I am repentant, but not enough to promise that I won't do it again if a phrase 
falls into my mind that has the sound of Alpine goat bells or water over round 
stones. But not about Gaius Julius Caesar. That kid is safe from my 
self-indulgent maunderings. Ave, Caesar, and mea culpa.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED FROM VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a small inlet on Knight Island in Alaska's magnificent Prince William Sound, 
thick oil smothered every rock, every pebble, every grain of sand, soaking the 
beach and covering my boots. 
</P>
<P>
I was traveling with David Lawn, district supervisor in Valdez for Alaska's 
Department of Environmental Conservation, on his hourly rounds as he tracked 
the recent massive oil spill from the Exxon tanker. Lawn lifted a stone with 
his toe. He loves the wild, untouched sound so much that his voice cracked when 
he spoke of what has happened to it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's even oil under rocks that probably have never been turned over by 
human hands," he said, nudging another stone as if trying to find perhaps just 
one that had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
David Grimes, a fisherman accompanying us, often set his salmon nets off this 
beach. "It will be a long time before we are fishing here again," he murmured 
wistfully, his eyes scanning the sea as two fishing boats slipped by, towing 
what looked like mere threads of orange boom. The boats were trying to gather 
one of the thousands of traveling oil slicks that had dispersed from the 
largest oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just that once-pure water is now marbled with globs of oil. It is not 
just that beaches have been so dirtied one would simply rather not look at 
them. It is not that I saw even bald eagles, the very symbol of the United 
States, sullied with grease. Or that these great birds will feed on oil-soaked 
animals and may die, too. It is that in Prince William Sound, the spill has 
created ecological anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on this island, sometimes ankle-deep in oil, I felt that the details 
of what happened the night the captain of the Exxon Valdez left his command 
were increasingly irrelevant. All that seemed to matter was how to prevent 
another Prince William Sound -- not just the spill itself, but its chaotic 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot eliminate human frailty or error. But we can at least equip ourselves 
with more than the hope it will never recur. 
</P>
<P>
Around the middle of May, seals will begin to pup on beaches that, when I saw 
them, were covered by oil. In June, salmon migrations will start. Waterfowl 
begin migrating en masse into Prince William Sound early in May. Will these 
creatures be safe? Not unless the cleanup proceeds with much more precision 
than it has. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, currents, weather and time move the oil unpredictably. Yet, I 
watched from a helicopter while the oval trap of an oil skimmer uselessly 
collected apparently unsoiled water, even as oil slicks floated free on either 
side. Obviously, the skimmer's operator could not see the oil from water level. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered why they didn't use planes and helicopters to spot for the skimmers. 
Later, the question was put to Dennis Kelso, Alaska's commissioner of 
Environmental Conservation. "We've been asking that ourselves for two weeks," 
he said on April 7 at the airport, speaking of the cleanup effort mounted by 
Exxon and the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference the next day, Coast Guard officials agreed that spotting 
was the most effective way for skimmers to work. But no one seemed able to 
explain why the system hadn't been adequately used since the oil first spilled 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing as complicated as the Prince William cleanup can operate perfectly. But 
all on the scene, as well as President Bush, have agreed that the spill exposed 
a terrifying fact: Contingency plans for such an occurrence were almost totally 
inadequate for an accident of this size and type, where so much oil spilled in 
such an environmentally sensitive area so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I was swept up in the emotion of seeing the oil spill's devastating 
effects, but it seems to me that ports handling oil in volume ought to 
immediately establish emergency response centers, as common to each as a city 
hall. Such centers must be more than words on paper. They would store adequate 
cleanup equipment, coordinate emergency housing and communications, and above 
all hold regular drills for resident cleanup personnel so that a meaningful 
response can be tested and refined -- in good weather, bad weather, all 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
Better cleanup capability will have to become a cost of doing business in oil, 
not only in the United States, but throughout the world, for this accident 
could have occurred with any ship, any captain, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the sound will be back to "normal" in 10 or 15 years. But for many who 
live and work on the sound, it might as well be for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
As I left Knight Island, I noticed a single white feather on the ground. I 
thought it was the only unspoiled trace in this dark place. But David Grimes, 
too, had a find. He picked up a tiny shell, the size of his fingernail, 
apparently untouched by the spill. "Here's a clean one for the future," he 
said, smiling his first small smile of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The only adequate response to the events of Prince William Sound is to try to 
ensure that they never happen again. Otherwise, all of this will just have been 
a very expensive and tragic practice run.

FAMILY TOGETHERNESS ON EXCITING HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT DICKERMAN, Dickerman, a New York-based free-lance writer, is the author 
of Farm, Ranch &amp; Country Vacations (Adventure Guides Inc.). She also 
publishes the Adventure Newsletter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discovery, participation, spontaneity . . . all qualities that bring a spirit 
of adventure to family vacations. 
</P>
<P>
In America there are many ways to include adventurous activities in holiday 
plans. Your family can learn to ride horseback, canoe a river, sail a boat. Or 
pack into spectacular mountains by horse, hike with llamas, experience 
wilderness camping for the first time and absorb the awesome beauty of a 
majestic canyon. 
</P>
<P>
As for adventure abroad, you can even take young children trekking in Nepal, 
cruising on canals in England or riding a safari vehicle in Kenya. For all but 
the very youngest, consider exploring the Galapagos Islands or touring Down 
Under in a motor home. 
</P>
<P>
An astonishing number of special services offer rich and varied experiences for 
all ages. Here are 10 recommendations for out-of-the-ordinary vacations, both 
in America and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking With Llamas. The key to family camping in spectacular wilderness areas 
used to be the ability to tote your own food and equipment in a backpack. Now 
youngsters and oldsters alike who do not carry backpacks can walk into these 
scenic regions while friendly llamas carry their gear. 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea is a natural for families . . . as well as llamas. These gentle, 
intelligent creatures have inherited remarkable mountaineering skills from 
ancestors who for centuries transported goods and military supplies for the 
Incas from sea level to Andean passes at 16,000 feet. Along with their toting 
skills, the docile animals are both curious and lovable, and they often 
establish a close bond with the hikers who lead them. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Biggs, who first recognized the ability of llamas to assist and 
entertain hikers, raises and trains the woolly, quick-learning beasts at Mt. 
Shasta in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
In that area you'll experience alpine meadows, riverbeds with deep bathing 
pools, glaciated ridges, grand views of Mt. Shasta, sunsets you'll never 
forget, and lush lakes with self-sustaining populations of brook, brown and 
rainbow trout. Most hikes are rated easy to moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Shasta and other nearby towns are the meeting points for three- and 
five-day trips into the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Trinity Alps 
regions. Both venues offer magnificent views, well-organized camping and 
companionable four-legged trail mates. Trips are scheduled from mid-June to 
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for three-day trips, Friday to Sunday, of easy to moderate modes: $350 
per adult, $315 for children up to 12 years. For five-day trips, Monday to 
Friday, moderate to strenuous: $500 per adult, $450 per child up to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Paddling and Poling. The St. Croix River, which marks part of the northern 
border of Maine with Canada, has lots of easy white water and exceptionally 
beautiful campsites with river vistas. This combination makes it ideal for 
family canoe trips. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Brown, an expert canoeist who also offers excursions in Texas and the 
Yukon, considers the St. Croix the best of all family canoe trips. 
</P>
<P>
Brown schedules small groups on the river every Sunday through Friday, this 
year from May 21 until Sept. 3, and offers either shorter or longer custom 
trips to private parties who want to canoe the river according to plans 
developed especially for them. 
</P>
<P>
Canoeing the St. Croix becomes a traveling classroom. Brown's lessons include 
the forgotten art of poling. "Our system of coaching can turn almost anyone 
into a strong, graceful, solo canoeist with both pole and paddle in just a few 
days," he says. Brown's guides are experienced professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of Martin's company, Sunrise County Canoe Expeditions, is on 
Cathance Lake, a two-hour drive from the Bangor airport. Van service goes to 
the lake every day at 4 p.m. ($10 per person); float plane transport can also 
be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
You arrive at camp on Saturday in time for a welcoming feast that may start 
with baked stuffed clams, steamers and barbecued chicken, and end with 
blueberry cake. There's no scrimping on menus and no packaged food on these 
trips; fresh baking takes place at every meal, and wine, candles and flowers at 
campsite dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Six-day trips are open for up to 12 canoeists. Family rates are $565 per adult 
and $377 for children 7 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the Ranch. When a 3-year-old rides horseback at the Averills' Flathead 
Lake Ranch, carefully held on the saddle in front of a kindly wrangler, it's a 
moment to be remembered. At 6 years, children receive horseback instruction and 
go on real trail rides. 
</P>
<P>
There are fast rides and slow rides, half-day and all-day rides, breakfast 
rides, evening rides and dusty rides. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning at 6 the more enthusiastic kids are down at the barn brushing and 
saddling the horses and helping the wrangler with the day's chores. 
</P>
<P>
Some children, along with some parents, will be out in the arena later trying 
to rope cattle. The Averills are basically a cowboy family that loves rodeo 
competition and enjoys teaching horsemanship and cowboy skills. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch is in the Rocky Mountains of northwest Montana, just south of Glacier 
National Park. With 2,000 acres bordering 30-mile-long Flathead Lake, it was 
inevitable that water sports would vie with riding as a favorite activity. 
</P>
<P>
You learn to sail on a small fleet of 14-foot boats or on the 1929 Q Class 
racing sloop. A cruiser provides transport down the lake to Wild Horse Island 
for a day of observing its horses, donkeys and bighorn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Or you cruise to the put-in on the Lower Fork of the Flathead River for a day 
of rafting. Powerboats tow you on water skis while you practice your skills, 
and Boogie boards help young ones who need to gain confidence before trying the 
skis. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all this going on at the ranch, many guests take a day to drive to 
Glacier National Park (45 minutes away) and over Going-to-the-Sun Highway to 
the top of Logan Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Other sorties in the area are made by plane -- up to Spotted Bear Wilderness 
for fly fishing, or for rafting back on the Swan River. Hikers go into Jewel 
Basin, a Primitive Area just five miles from the ranch; it's like hiking in 
Glacier. And back at the ranch, four professionally surfaced tennis courts 
absorb some guests' time. 
</P>
<P>
With unusually comfortable accommodations for up to 100 guests, Flathead Lake 
Ranch is open from the end of May to early September at all-inclusive rates of 
$989 a week per adult, double occupancy, $797 for teens, $671 for ages 4 to 12 
and $96 under 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising British Canals. The Brits offer a holiday of cruising old canals that 
were used 200 years ago for floating harvests to market. Today they consider 
canal boats the biggest thing in the Isles for family outings. UK Waterway 
Holidays (represented by Ambassador Travel in Ft. Collins, Colo.) offers more 
than 150 family- or company-owned boats that can be booked by vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
The network of canals in England, Wales and Scotland opens 1,500 miles of 
waterways, with two categories of boats for cruising: hotel boats, which offer 
cabins and meals for up to 12 guests (who must be 15 or older), and 
self-skippered boats. At a top speed of 4 m.p.h., you cruise about 10 to 15 
miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
Reasonably energetic and agile people discover how easy it is to skipper a 
boat. The steering is usually by a simple tiller, and a route-planner map keeps 
you from getting lost. Villagers direct you to special features along the way, 
and a guidebook describes the best places to stop for meals or where to buy 
food to cook in the galley. 
</P>
<P>
The boats are equipped with everything needed in the kitchen, bathroom and 
cabins. Other provisions include heat, electric power, wet-weather gear, 
lockable external doors, TV and/or radio, and safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
A basic rule is to choose a boat that accommodates two more than are in your 
party; that way you won't have to convert the dinette to a double bed. 
</P>
<P>
Boats have from two to 12 berths. Boatyards are established at more than 30 
points in the canal network. Tour organizers will either pick up passengers at 
nearby rail stations or advise them on taxi fares. 
</P>
<P>
As an extra service, they'll go to market for your initial grocery list and 
stow it in the galley, ready for your arrival. 
</P>
<P>
For children, the more locks the better. They walk the towpaths and help to 
work the locks or swing bridges. Another highlight is biking at some of the 
ports. But just cruising along is untiring fun for all. 
</P>
<P>
Rates vary according to season and size of boat. For a family of four, the 
average weekly rate for a six-berth, self-skippered boat in high season, June 
23 to Aug. 31, is $1,408. 
</P>
<P>
Riding and Rafting. From the Tavaputs Ranch on a 9,100-foot plateau in Utah, 
you gaze out upon red-rock canyons and far peaks of the Uinta Mountains and 
Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch borders the Green River, and from the canyon rim you see the river 
flowing through Desolation Canyon, 5,000 feet below. This is the locale for an 
outstanding combination riding and rafting trip, provided by Western River 
Expeditions of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
It starts with a scenic charter flight from Grand Junction, Colo., to the 
landing strip at Tavaputs Ranch, where four generations of the Wilcox family 
have raised cattle. You explore mountain overlooks and slickrock canyons on 
horseback and in four-wheel-drive vehicles. This is an area where Butch Cassidy 
once rode. He was an acquaintance of Wilcox forbears. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are memorable, with cowboys and guests sharing family-size tables. After 
dinner there's music, reading and relaxing around the lodge's big stone 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
On day 3 your pilot flies in to transport you to the Sand Wash put-in point for 
a few days of rafting and camping on the Green River. The scenes change 
constantly as you wind through the colorful canyon in neoprene rafts that carry 
up to seven passengers plus a boatman. 
</P>
<P>
Six- and seven-day expeditions include two nights at Tavaputs Ranch, three or 
four nights (depending on dates) on the river, plus charter flights, bus 
transport, all meals and activities, at $845 per adult and $495 for 7- to 
17-year-olds. Departures are scheduled for June 4, 12, 19 and 28, July 6, 14 
and 21, and Aug. 7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Horsepacking in the Canadian Rockies. What better way for an unhurried look at 
the glory and grandeur of the Canadian Rockies than from the back of a 
sure-footed, gentle horse? Drink in the magnificence of snowcapped mountains 
with glaciers and waterfalls and pine-circled lakes deep in hidden valleys. 
</P>
<P>
It's exciting to penetrate this spectacular wilderness, and you don't have to 
be an experienced rider. Even beginners can make it with the competent help of 
mountain guides, although it's not a trip for children under 10. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guides who take visitors into this majestic area are the McKenzies, a 
family team of specialists who work together to make you feel at home in the 
high country. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are picked up at the Calgary airport and driven to a town called Rocky 
Mountain House. Overnight accommodations are at Walking Eagle Inn. Next day you 
drive to the trail head and mount up for six days of riding and camping. It's 
"superb, breathtaking, unbelievable," according to one trekker. 
</P>
<P>
The first night's camp is along the trail. Then you ride on to the McKenzies' 
base camp at Jobs Lake for three days of riding and exploring. 
</P>
<P>
These six-day excursions are scheduled to start every Monday from the last week 
of June to the last week of August, at a rate of $795 Canadian per rider. The 
rate includes Calgary pickup and return, but not overnight at the Walking 
Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
Family Trek in Nepal. Take the children trekking in Nepal? Why not? The younger 
ones will soon be playing okhar kuti, gatthi and kamakuti with Nepalese 
youngsters -- variations of hopscotch, jacks and jump rope. In Nepal the family 
unit is of prime importance, and a trekking family receives a special welcome 
all along the way. 
</P>
<P>
A Massachusetts-based company, Above the Clouds, keeps children in mind in 
planning both the menu and the route for a 17-day trek. Porters carry not only 
your gear but small children, and infants ride in safe, comfortable baby 
backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in Katmandu you drive to Gorkha to start 8 days of trekking in 
elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet, with superb close views of the Annapurna, 
Himalchuli and Ganesh Himel massifs. Most days the treks are easy, and the more 
strenuous trips are limited to half-days. Nights are spent in villages, with 
ample time to rest and visit with the Nepalese (with the help of your bilingual 
guides). 
</P>
<P>
Few trekkers have used this route, so contact with the people in secluded 
villages is all the more authentic. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-day Family Trek is scheduled to leave the United States Dec. 23, and 
Feb. 10 and June 23, 1990. The rate (not including air) is $1,400 per adult, 
$800 for ages 8 to 15, $700 for ages 2 to 7 and $400 under 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
An Enchanted Expedition. Stroll the beach with a 200-year-old tortoise. Talk 
with a fur seal. Play in the surf with a sea lion. Make friends with a 
blue-footed booby. Smile at an iguana. No, this is neither a set for "Sesame 
Street" or a scene from "Alice in Wonderland." That's what travelers do when 
they visit the Galapagos Islands, 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a flight from Los Angeles to Quito in Ecuador, and from there to the 
Baltra airstrip in these enchanted islands. Board a motor sailer, schooner or 
ketch carrying from four to 10 passengers and several crew. This is your home 
for a week of sailing and exploring the volcanic islands, where quite 
unself-conscious animals and birds observe you . . . and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Each yacht is staffed by experienced seamen, a cook and an expert American or 
English naturalist guide, trained and certified by the Darwin Research Station 
in Academy Bay. Most inter-island sailing is accomplished at night, so days are 
free for shore visits and, of course, for swimming and snorkeling. These are 
not luxury cruises, but bunks are adequate and food good and plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness Travel, a California company, has scheduled departures to the 
Galapagos on May 22, June 12 and 26, July 10 and 24, Aug. 14 and Dec. 18. 
Groups consist of up to 10 participants 14 years and older, except for the July 
10 trip, which is designated specifically for families with kids 5 and older. 
</P>
<P>
The rate for 11 days, including air fare from Los Angeles, the rate is $2,690 
per adult, $2,390 for children 5 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
Family Safari in Kenya. Imagine seeing a lion, elephant, buffalo, cheetah or 
leopard from your safari vehicle, all in the same day in Kenya's Amboseli 
National Park. In succeeding days you can become familiar with many other 
species -- giant hogs, giraffe, eland, zebra, rhino and hippo, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are 4, 44 or 84, each member of the family can find excitement in 
the sights and sounds of game viewing, the sheer beauty of this land and the 
easy life at bush camp. 
</P>
<P>
Safari hands at tented camps provide services that include cooking, doing 
laundry, making beds and bringing hot water for showers. 
</P>
<P>
Starting from New York, you stop in Geneva before flying on to Nairobi. The 
18-day itinerary includes several days at Amboseli National Park, and overnight 
at the famous Treetops in Aberdare National Park, where you have a close look 
at animals who visit the flood-lit salt lick after dark. 
</P>
<P>
The second week takes you to Lewa Downs and an opportunity to approach game on 
foot and on horseback. Then it's on to Lake Naivasha with its thousands of 
birds, and to the Masai Mara Game Reserve. From Nairobi, the flight home is 
broken by a brief stop in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
Special family departures are scheduled July 10 and Aug. 7, though additional 
departures accept family bookings. The land cost for adults is $5,200, and for 
children under 12 sharing tents with parents, about $3,400. 
</P>
<P>
On Your Own in a Motor Home. Driving and camping is a favorite pastime for 
family travel in America. As a luxurious counterpart Down Under, exploring the 
thousand miles from north to south in New Zealand, a motor home adjusts to 
spontaneous planning, stopping and going as you wish. There are good roads and 
light traffic, and numerous options for overnights at comfortable hotels, 
motels, guest farms and camping parks. 
</P>
<P>
Or just pull off for the night beside a lake or stream. A 3 1/2-hour ferry ride 
takes you and your vehicle across Queen Charlotte Sound between the North and 
South Islands. 
</P>
<P>
There's so much to discover in New Zealand. Cruise the Bay of Islands in a 
catamaran. Visit the glowworm caves, thermal geysers, settlements of the 
Maoris, sheep farms, vineyards and magnificent beaches. Go skiing or trout 
fishing. Ride a jet boat through waterways only four inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
Trek (in New Zealand it's tramp) along an excellent network of paths, trails 
and huts. You can raft or canoe down the Waitroa River, explore the back 
country on horseback, soar over scenic Milford Sound in a small plane or land 
by ski plane on the rugged slopes of Tasman Glacier. 
</P>
<P>
From June to mid-October, daily rates are $117 for a six-berth motor home and 
$70 for three berths, plus insurance and tax. Rates during the U.S. winter 
months (New Zealand's summer) are higher. 
</P>
<P>
Mount Cook Line provides a complete "travelpak" with discounts for its 
motor-home customers as well as offering other travel services and help in 
planning an itinerary.

TRAVEL IN 21ST CENTURY WILL BE DOWN A FAST TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Airplanes will fly five times the speed of sound and carry 300 to 400 
passengers, reaching destinations in minutes. Today it takes hours. 
</P>
<P>
Trains will run up to 300 m.p.h. and ride as smoothly as rolling on glass. 
Cruise ships will carry 5,000 passengers in tri-hulled vessels, with 12-story 
hotel towers amidships. 
</P>
<P>
A driving vacation will probably be mapped out on a screen mounted on the 
dashboard. If traffic thickens ahead, the screen will offer alternative routes. 
</P>
<P>
Science fiction? 
</P>
<P>
Not according to Montreal-based futurist Louis D'Amore, who spoke of what lies 
ahead in travel and transportation during a speech at Gov. George Duekmejian's 
recent annual tourism conference. D'Amore believes that some, or all, could 
come about in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beyond Concorde 
</P>
<P>
Take that Mach 5 airliner, for instance. We have become accustomed to hearing 
about the Concorde, the first supersonic jet, which does better than Mach 1. 
</P>
<P>
But the Anglo-French Concorde is no longer in production, and, when the few 
that exist are retired in 10 to 15 years, there are no others to take their 
place. However, plans are to build a second generation of supersonic carriers. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amore said that West Germany is working on plans for a jet with a top speed 
of Mach 4.4. The Soviet Union is doing even better; it is planning to fly a 
liner at Mach 5 as early as 1999. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amore believes that there will be a transitional supersonic transport (SST) 
somewhere between the Concorde and the new super-fast aircraft . . . somewhere 
near Mach 3, about 2,000 m.p.h 
</P>
<P>
The United States also is building an SST. It is hoped that the jet will test 
fly in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unresolved Issues 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with SSTs in the earth's atmosphere, of course, is that the 
environmental issues (noise, air pollution, etc.) that prevented the Concorde 
from flying over U.S. land have yet to be addressed. SSTs are still a political 
hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
Also there's the cost, which could be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the obstacles, enough plans have been laid for D'Amore to envision the 
inside cabins. 
</P>
<P>
Every seat in the U.S. version will have its own phone and TV console, offering 
programs in several languages. Passengers will play video games, run their own 
computer programs, send fax messages and make hotel and car-rental reservations 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
If the public suddenly develops a thirst for supersonic transportation, target 
test dates might be brought forward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ground Speed 
</P>
<P>
In addition, consider the trains. Again, we're looking at a new generation of 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese introduced its famed bullet train in 1964. It wasn't until 1981 
that France followed with its version, which has an average speed of 125 m.p.h. 
and has reached 165 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1990s West Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium will have high-speed 
rail systems. Before the end of the century they will link most of Europe's 
major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is studying a 300 m.p.h. rail engine. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure is mounting in the United States to develop a similar system. 
Advocates point out that trains are energy efficient, do the least damage to 
the environment and are the least expensive mode of public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Speed Competition 
</P>
<P>
D'Amore reported that a dozen states have feasibility studies in the works, and 
that Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas are determined to be first in the 
high-speed train business. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-Las Vegas is a possible route for a high-speed system. And Amtrak, 
the nation's rail company, believes the Los Angeles-San Diego run would be most 
promising for such a system. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise ships in the 21st Century will be at least 100,000 tons and carry 5,000 
passengers. Passengers will be whisked around by a rail system, presumably a 
little slower than 300 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amore said that building these new vehicles isn't the tough part. Finding 
room for them to maneuver is. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amore warned that congestion could be the major inhibitor of travel by the 
turn of the century. He said that shortages of adequate roads, airports and 
bridges -- what he called "our aging infrastructure" -- could negate the 
technological gains that promise to make travel in 2000 and beyond a new 
adventure.

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE, Times Travel Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susanne Lakin and her musician husband Lee Miller are opening a Cape Cod-style 
B&amp;B on the ocean at Trinidad (about 50 miles below the Oregon border). This 
is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. First, because this is a newly built 
B&amp;B. Second, the couple will be catering particularly to families with 
rates that'll be hard to beat: $75/$90 double, $5 extra for children up to age 
16. Singles: $65/$80. The 5,000-square-foot home features ocean-view rooms, 
lofts for youngsters, a Jacuzzi. There's a children's play area with farm 
animals. Child care will be provided in the evening while parents dine out. 
Susanne and Lee came up with the idea for their B&amp;B "out of frustration 
with not being able to enjoy a B&amp;B while traveling with our own children." 
To get a fix on Trinidad, it's 22 miles north of Eureka, a short drive from the 
Arcata-Eureka Airport and only minutes from the redwoods. Guests will awaken to 
the barking of sea lions, home-baked breads, muffins, smoked salmon and quiches 
made with farm-fresh eggs and vegetables. At the sunset hour the hosts will 
serve cappuccino, wine, home-baked pastries. 
</P>
<P>
Susanne Lakin and Lee Miller, The Lost Whale, 3452 Patrick's Point Drive, 
Trinidad, Calif. 95570. Telephone (707) 677-3425. Note: The inn opens May 1. 
Current number: (707) 677-3827. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma Valley Inns 
</P>
<P>
Ira and Irene Greenspan of San Bernardino ask for recommendations for inns in

some with fireplaces. A swimming pool and an award-winning restaurant. Rates: 
$92.50/$135 double, including a full breakfast. In town try the Healdsburg Inn 
On The Plaza. Rooms with private baths, loads of antiques. Overlooks the town 
square. Rates: $65/$85 midweek, $85/$115 weekends (full breakfast). 
</P>

England's Prettiest Village 
</P>
<P>
Castle Combe has been described as England's prettiest village. Only 10 miles 
from Bath. It's the perfect spot for touring the Cotswolds, Stonehenge, Oxford, 
Winchester. (Hollywood chose Castle Combe for the home of "Dr. Doolittle".) Now 
you can vacation in the village's oldest home, the Old Courthouse, built in the 
early 1400s. Timbered, exposed oak beams, a winding staircase that leads to 
three upstairs bedrooms (one with an open fireplace, a four-poster bed). Ideal 
for three couples. Rents for $2,000 a week. Reduced rates between 
October/March. The Old Courthouse is one of the most photographed homes in 
Britain. Other cottages with gabled roofs line Water Lane.

HOT ON THE TRAIL OF NOMADS IN MOROCCAN DESERT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
GOULIMINE, Morocco 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For centuries the fiery sands of the Sahara have been called the "Garden of 
Allah." 
</P>
<P>
Those traveling by camel caravan along its ancient trails may see this desert 
as a gigantic cathedral of scintillating beauty and grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
Its dome is the azure blue of a cloudless sky. Under the rays of a torrid sun, 
the hundreds of gigantic sand dunes are transformed into altars of shimmering 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
In the night, beneath a star-flecked sky, an ominous wind may blow across the 
sandy wastes in tones low and vibrant like those of a mighty organ magnified a 
thousandfold. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the lonely and foreboding Sahara is their only home. Although the 
life of a desert nomad is cruel and primitive, untold hundreds of caravans are 
still following dusty trails from one oasis to another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colorful Wanderers 
</P>
<P>
Of all the desert wanderers, most colorful are the Tauregs, more popularly 
known as Blue Men because the indigo that they use to dye their robes rubs off 
on their bodies and gives them a bluish cast. 
</P>
<P>
A matriarchy, the tribe is governed by its older women. Tales of their past are 
handed down from mother to daughter. Some of these stories sound incredible. 
</P>
<P>
The Tauregs believe they are the descendants of the survivors of the Lost 
Continent of Atlantis and are destined to roam the desert until such time as 
Atlantis one day rises from its watery grave. Then they can return to their 
ancient homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Although I have visited Morocco many times, I decided to return again and learn 
more about this tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Flying first to Marrakech, I journeyed south by bus to the small town of 
Goulimine, where I had been told the Blue Men occasionally dispose of their 
livestock and make purchases before setting out again across the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Town on Desert Rim 
</P>
<P>
Goulimine, on the rim of the desert, is made up of a few dirt streets and 
one-story pink adobe buildings. There is little motor traffic, but moving about 
are burros, camels, goats and sheep, their plaintive cries breaking the 
stillness as they wind their way toward the camel market held each weekend in a 
walled square on the outskirts of town. 
</P>
<P>
The desert people need little to survive -- sugar and salt and a few other 
items that they buy at the kiosks with money from the sale of their animals and 
hand-woven rugs. 
</P>
<P>
During weekends Goulimine is a meeting place for desert tribesmen of the south 
and sharp-eyed white-robed businessmen from the north, who wheel and deal with 
the nomads. 
</P>
<P>
While wandering through the camel market I stopped at a kiosk where a Taureg 
woman was selling rugs. She spoke Spanish, having spent much of her time in 
Tan-Tan on the Spanish Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
The Tauregs speak a language called Shelha, the origin of which is lost. At 
first Fatma eyed me suspiciously, but after I bought one of her rugs she became 
more responsive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Four Days by Camel' 
</P>
<P>
I told her I wanted to visit a Taureg encampment. After a bit of coaxing she 
invited me to join her on a trip to the oasis of Kazir. How far? She shrugged 
and replied: "Four days by camel." 
</P>
<P>
Early Monday I was on a camel heading southeast. Abdel, Fatma's husband, led 
the way, followed by their two young sons, Mohsen and Ahmad. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly we entered another world of shimmering sand dunes that glistened like 
molten gold under the first rays of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The ride was anything but pleasant. Until I learned to relax and sway with the 
erratic movements of my camel, I felt as if I was churning about inside a 
cement mixer. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later we arrived at Kazir. Scattered among the date palms were 
several goatskin tents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scattered Tribes 
</P>
<P>
No one knows just how many Tauregs there are, but they run into the tens of 
thousands and are scattered throughout Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and 
Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
They are the best cameleers, and are one of several Berber tribes whose 
ancestors lived along North Africa's Mediterranean coast but who migrated south 
to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The men are tall and slender, with strong angular faces. The women are 
extremely attractive, some with Mongolian features. Centuries ago the Taureg 
tribesmen were feared by other nomads as bandits of the desert. They are no 
longer hostile, though they remain aloof. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most Moslems, the women bare their faces. The men wear a black muslin 
tagilmust, or turban, wound several times around their heads and draped across 
their noses, providing protection from the Sahara sun as well as the tiny 
particles of sand that seem to permeate the desert air. 
</P>
<P>
According to this tribe's legends, the Tauregs once lived on a lush island 
called "Atlantiki" -- or Atlantis -- with green valleys surrounded by 
snow-covered peaks. 
</P>
<P>
They were a happy, carefree people, and counted among them artists, sculptors, 
poets, philosophers and skilled artisans who excelled at delicate filigree work 
with silver and gold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to the Past 
</P>
<P>
If there is a single link between past and present, it might be in their folk 
dance, the quedra. From childhood every woman in the tribe learns the sensuous 
movements of this dance, which is performed only upon the knees. 
</P>
<P>
Their graceful arms and flicking fingers seem to convey the secret message of a 
bygone era. As the dance progresses the body sways and writhes, while the 
dancer's long hair is tossed wildly about the face. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, exhausted, the dancer slumps forward and remains motionless for 
several moments. 
</P>
<P>
According to Amin, the quedra was the most popular of all the dances performed 
by their ancient queen's palace dancers during their sacred festivals. Its 
origin and meaning are mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
I stayed with the Tauregs four weeks. While the men tended their animals the 
women kept busy by gathering brush for firewood, preparing meals, taking care 
of the children and drawing water from a communal well. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, they spent countless hours at small, crude looms, weaving 
colorful rugs that they would sell at some distant village. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Goulimine can be used as a base of operations while exploring southern Morocco. 
Fly into Marrakech or Agadir. From either city it's a few hours' drive by 
rental car through some fascinating countryside to Goulimine. 
</P>
<P>
The town is almost deserted during the hottest months (June through August). 
The best time to visit is from October through March. Visit the Saturday or 
Sunday market, where nomadic tribes, including the Blue Men, sell their 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Goulimine has no deluxe hotels but the 27-room Salam is clean and comfortable 
and close to the camel market. The Pension Ere Nouvelle has 12 rooms (and its 
food is a little better). Expect to pay between $20 and $35 at both. Newest 
hotel is the Mauritania, which averages about $30 to $45 a night. 
</P>
<P>
If the hotels in Goulimine are full, you can stay in nearby Tiznit at the El 
Minzah, which has a small pool, the Tiznit or the Mauritania (different from 
the Mauritania in Goulimine). Prices average between $20 and $30. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Air Maroc flies into Tangier, Marrakech, Fez and Casablanca from most 
major U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
Train service throughout Morocco is generally excellent. It's reliable, and 
food is often available. 
</P>
<P>
Take a camel ride. On weekend nights you'll be able to watch the Taureg women 
perform the quedra, either at your hotel or at a restaurant in Goulimine, 
Rendel-Vous des Hommes Bleus.

KEEPING HEALTHY: TABLETS MAY BE ONE WAY TO COUNTERACT JET LAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. KARL NEUMANN, Neumann is a Forest Hills, N.Y., pediatrician who writes 
on travel-related matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Anti Jet Lag Formula is a vitamin-amino acid formulation that the 
manufacturer claims can reduce the effects of jet lag. It contains two amino 
acids -- tryptophane to help induce sleep, and tyrosine to promote better 
performance during the day -- and vitamin B6 to help metabolize the 
tryptophane. Tablets are to be taken over a 12-hour period after arrival at 
your destination. 
</P>
<P>
Does it work? The accompanying literature gives testimonials from known 
personalities, but is weak on scientific facts to support claims. But 
dietitians say the ingredients can't harm you. The Anti Jet Lag Formula is 
available at drugstores, airports and from American Biosearch, 5820 Oberlin 
Drive, Suite 202, San Diego, Calif. 92121. A two-day supply is $5.95; for 12 
days, $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
Check with your physician if you take blood pressure medication and plan to 
travel to the tropics or to high-altitude destinations, says the Medical 
Travelers' Advisory. 
</P>
<P>
At high altitudes, getting sufficient oxygen depends on a more rapid heart 
rate. However, some blood pressure medication -- beta blockers, for example -- 
interferes with your heart beating faster. Therefore, your dosage of medication 
may have to be reduced before your trip. 
</P>
<P>
Diuretics (water pills) can cause problems when you travel from winter 
temperatures to the tropics. The combination of diuretics and increased 
perspiration may cause dehydration. The situation is further complicated by 
sports, exercise and, sometimes, the inability to get a low-salt diet. 
</P>
<P>
Brightly colored, lead-glazed earthen pottery items brought back from Mexico, 
China and other developing countries make attractive ornaments for your home. 
But think twice before using them for holding food, says the University of 
California, Berkeley, Wellness Letter. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that these items may not have been fired at sufficiently high 
temperatures to bind the lead properly. As a result, foods, especially acidic 
foods such as wine, orange and tomato juices, coffee, some sauces, pickles and 
salad dressings can leach out the lead. Then when you eat the food, you absorb 
the lead, which could cause lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Earthen pottery bought in Europe and Japan, where laws require that high 
temperatures be used, is less likely to cause problems. But even there, buy 
earthen jars from reputable dealers. 
</P>
<P>
If you must smoke when visiting developing countries, take cigarettes with you. 
The cigarettes you buy there may be more hazardous than those in this country. 
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, the worst cigarettes are in 
Indonesia. The average cigarette there contains about five times the tar and 
three times the nicotine of the average cigarette in North America and Western 
Europe. Other countries with particularly unhealthy cigarettes: Turkey and the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The best time to travel during pregnancy is the fourth through the sixth 
months, when you have adjusted to the pregnancy but are not yet so bulky that 
moving about is difficult. That's according to the booklet "Travel During 
Pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
The safest seat belt during pregnancy is one with both shoulder and lap 
restraints. Fasten the lap belt low across the hips, under the bulge of your 
abdomen. Place a scarf or thin blanket between the belt and your body for 
increased comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women take longer to adjust to jet lag, so allow a couple of days of 
rest after flights. 
</P>
<P>
For copies of the free booklet, write to the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists, 600 Maryland Ave. SW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 
20024-2588. 
</P>
<P>
Never sleep during the descent of airplane flights. Sleep decreases swallowing 
and swallowing helps you keep up with pressure changes during descent, 
according to the leaflet "Ears, Altitude and Airplane Travel." 
</P>
<P>
Use nasal sprays and decongestants after flights when ears do not unblock. If 
ear discomfort continues for more than a day, see a physician. Prolonged 
blockage in your ears can cause problems later. 
</P>
<P>
The free leaflet has many other helpful facts. Write to the American Academy of 
Otolaryngology, 1101 Vermont Ave. NW, Suite 302, Washington D.C. 20005.

NATIONAL PHONE SERVICE PROVIDES FLIGHT UPDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM, Friedheim is editor-publisher of Travel Agent magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is there a national telephone service that offers up-to-date 
information about flight delays, weather, airport transportation and other 
travel facilities? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Airline Passengers of America, based in Alexandria, Va., has a number 
providing such information: (800) 872-2359. The service costs 75 cents a 
minute, charged to your Visa or MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the amount of duty-free merchandise that travelers can bring back 
from the U.S. Virgin Islands? 
</P>
<P>
A: The duty-free allowance is $800 for U.S. island possessions, including the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Guam, but not Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Q: During our extended foreign trip we'd like to receive mail from home. Can 
this be sent care of our consulates or embassies? 
</P>
<P>
A: They don't handle private mail. Have it sent to general delivery at post 
offices in cities you are planning to visit. Some banks and credit-card 
companies also will hold mail for you. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can we bring back a parrot or parakeet sold in Mexican shops? 
</P>
<P>
A: Mexican birds, though widely sold, cannot be imported into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it really safe to pass film through airport X-ray machines? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some photographers still worry about possible damage. For a free folder on 
how to avoid problems, write to the National Assn. of Photographic 
Manufacturers, 550 Mamaroneck Ave., Harrison, N.Y. 10528; (914) 698-7603. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'd like to join a university educational tour. Must one be a student or 
alumnus to be eligible? 
</P>
<P>
A: Many colleges and universities sponsor trips for alumni, students and 
teachers, but outsiders often are accepted. Contact institutions in your area 
or your travel agent.

WHEN A BABY BULL NAMED BEN WAS HARD TO CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I recently took a trip to Tucson, Ariz. We had a dual purpose. Our 
daughter, son-in-law and 14-month-old grandchild, Ben, live there. Also, it was 
time for Tucson's La Fiesta de los Vaqueros and I love rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
Because I'm allergic to my daughter's long-haired cat, Joyce and I stayed at 
one of those big resort hotels. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the floors awash with toys. We missed the "pesky hour," that time of 
day -- or sometimes night -- when my grandson elects to develop his lungs. And, 
of course, we missed the diapers, but you can't have it all. 
</P>
<P>
So we made do at our hotel, with its multi-star restaurants, pools, tennis 
courts, stables, golf courses, gyms and, of course, the desert. 
</P>
<P>
There's no place better for sleeping than the desert. After going to bed I kind 
of felt as if I'd be missing too much if I closed my eyes, so I lay there in 
the dark, staring out the sliding glass door at the brilliant stars, listening 
to the desert silence, thinking and feeling myself unwind. 
</P>
<P>
After driving Joyce over to our daughter's house I gave everybody but the cat a 
quick hug and went to the La Fiesta parade. 
</P>
<P>
I got out my camera and the four-pound lens so I'd look like an official 
photographer, then found a spot near the reviewing stand. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man in what looked like $3 pants and a $100 hat smiled and held 
out his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Howdy. Ed Ledbetter," he said. We shook hands and I shouted my name over the 
music from an approaching band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Entries 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that," he said, holding up a list. "There are 453 entries in this 
parade. Great!" 
</P>
<P>
"Great? It's going to last longer than the rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head and handed me the list. There were entries like Pima Savings, 
The Guyton Family, the Marana Junior High School Band and Karen Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Ed waved at someone in the band and a girl playing a trombone let the slide go 
to wave back. The slide immediately fell out of the instrument. The music went 
sour for a second, but no one seemed to notice. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not your Rose/Sugar/Gator/Orange or Pineapple Bowl parade, where you 
see hundred-thousand-dollar floats made out of crushed kumquat leaves. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He had to shout over the cheering. The Tucson Jaycee-ettes were going by, 
followed closely by a man dressed up like a wildcat, then another marching 
band. 
</P>
<P>
"And in those other parades you might see 200-piece marching bands, but maybe 
only 60 people will be playing while the rest of them fake it. In these 
marching bands everybody plays. Looky there." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed at a boy with a blue uniform playing a trumpet while his band marked 
time in front of the reviewing stand. The boy would play a few notes, shake his 
head, take the horn from his mouth, say 'damn' and then do it again . . . and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The Armory Park Senior Citizens and the Tucson Chorus Girls marched by, then a 
contingent of American Indians. As a cowboy rode a tame Brahma bull up the 
street, the lady parade announcer said the bull had retired from rodeo, but a 
lot of people seemed to be looking for exits in case the bull might be planning 
a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
A six-foot cowboy in a one-foot Stetson paraded by, leading a beribboned 
10-inch poodle on a leash. The cowboy didn't look too thrilled, but the dog was 
having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Well now," said Ledbetter, "if this here isn't more fun than your average 
4,000-pound Pasadena poopsey-flower and turnip-seed-covered float, I don't know 
what is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Room for Both 
</P>
<P>
It was more fun, but I told him I thought there might be room in the world for 
both. It brought a grin. "You're about 100% right." 
</P>
<P>
A scraggly contingent of mountain men set the crowd cheering. They were 
followed closely by the Tucson Girl's Chorus, who didn't seem to be making a 
sound but whose lips moved in unison. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a boring minute. During the next two hours I had so much fun that 
I almost forgot to take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce likes rodeos, too, but there never was an attraction that could compete 
with a grandchild, so I went out to the rodeo grounds alone that afternoon. I 
sure didn't stay alone. Tucson residents just seem to include whoever's around 
in whatever's going on. It's a nice way to be. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening ceremonies at most of the rodeos I've attended, something else 
happens that I really like. Starting time arrives, a gate opens at one end of 
the arena and a girl comes riding in, hell bent for leather, carrying the flag. 
</P>
<P>
She races around the arena and pulls up hard, right in front of the grandstand, 
her horse settling on its haunches in a cloud of dust. Then she holds up the 
flag as high as she can. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody stands and we all sing the national anthem. Why that gets me, I don't 
know, but it does. 
</P>
<P>
At this show, after the flag ceremony the official rodeo announcer -- Hadley 
Barrett -- on a big chestnut horse with a black mane and tail, rode to the 
center of the arena with a wireless microphone and La Fiesta de los Vaqueros, 
the 64th annual Tucson Rodeo, began. 
</P>
<P>
Hadley seemed to know all of the cowboys competing, and almost 700 had signed 
up for the three-day event. He also knew the peculiarities of most of the 
show's livestock. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said. "Jim Hobson of Calgary is about to take a 
flying lesson. He'll be coming out of gate No. 2 on Sundancer, who spins to the 
right and always tries for altitude. The Dancer weighs 2,000 pounds and just 
hates skinny cowboys. You hold on good, Jim." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the bull came crashing out of the gate, spinning like a top. He 
whirled and arched and Hobson did seven seconds, riding on the bull's shoulders 
instead of his backside, counting his feet against the sky. Then he soared two 
yards up and three yards out and hit the ground with a whomp. 
</P>
<P>
Old Sundancer, figuring he'd never get a better chance to stomp a cowboy, 
really had a good try at it until the clowns distracted him. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said Hadley, "in rodeo, sometimes the only thing worse than letting go 
too soon is letting go too late." The crowd applauded as Hobson retrieved his 
hat, slapped the dust out of it and headed for his next event, walking as if he 
was mentally inventorying his bones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audience of Students 
</P>
<P>
About a hundred students in the section in front of me were cheering in a dozen 
languages. A blonde young lady who introduced herself as Lola Ramirez from 
Mexico City, said they were all members of a University of Arizona class 
studying English as a second language, and that this was kind of an informal 
lesson on North American customs. 
</P>
<P>
They all really loved it. Someone told me later that the students were the last 
group out of the stands all three days of La Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
On the last day Joyce and I shared a meal with our daughter and grandson in a 
restaurant. The hostess gave Ben a box of animal crackers and showed him how to 
"pretend-walk" the animals across the table. 
</P>
<P>
Ben thought that looked like fun, but by the time he walked them to the other 
side he'd reduced them to powder and there was nothing left to eat. 
</P>
<P>
His mother helped him fill in with French fries and ketchup. He ate the fries 
and wore the ketchup. If I remember correctly, his mother had done that as a 
child, too. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after we got home, a neighbor dropped in. When she asked if we'd had 
a good time, Joyce started digging our snapshots out of her purse. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia reached for the pictures. "Oh, is that the big boy? How darling." 
</P>
<P>
It was a pretty good picture. Joyce does a job with a camera when she likes the 
subject. I got to thinking about the next trip. After all, Tucson has an 
International Mariachi Competition coming up. Maybe we could take Ben out to 
the Silver Stallion Guest Ranch for a riding lesson. Can't start too early. 
</P>
<P>
Tucson's International Mariachi Conference and Competition, a cultural festival 
with workshops and a fair, will be held April 18-22. Linda Ronstadt and her dad 
(who can usually be talked into going on stage and singing with her) haven't 
missed the show in years. 
</P>

Convention and Visitor's Bureau, 130 S. Scott Ave., Tucson, Ariz. 85701, (602)

I recommend the Gallant Lady's cruise in the San Juan Islands. Read about it in 
your Travel Section last July (Travel Tips, July 24) and was there two weeks 
later. A welcome change of pace. Scenic, relaxing and excellent food. A true 
labor of love for Capt. Dick, his wife Lyn, family and crew. Nice people. A fun 
trip! For information, contact Gallant Lady Cruises, P.O. Box 1250, Vashon,

THE MATURE TRAVELER: ROOM RATE DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL, Kovell is a veteran journalist in seniors' interests. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the major Las Vegas resort hotels, the lavish Tropicana, is offering the 
mature traveler a 25% discount per room per night, regardless of published room 
rate, for an indefinite period in honor of its 30th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Besides all the accouterments of the typical Las Vegas resort, it has one of 
the most popular and longest-running production shows in the state of Nevada, 
the "Folies Bergere." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the discounted room rate the Tropicana will give senior guests a 
25% discount on the Folies Bergere dinner or cocktail show, the same discount 
on all meals in its Island Buffet and discounts on golf. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for these discounts, guests must be 60 years of age or older or 
members of a recognized senior organization such as AARP. For more information 
or reservations, call toll-free (800) GO-2-TROP, or write the Tropicana Hotel, 
3801 Las Vegas Blvd. South, Las Vegas 89109. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular destination for mature travelers is Palm Springs, where an "End 
of the Winter" holiday is being offered by the Wyndham Palm Springs resort 
hotel. The Wyndham is within easy walking distance of Palm Canyon Drive, the 
city's main shopping thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors will get a 50% discount off regular rates, including a daily buffet 
breakfast. Discounts are also offered in the Wyndham's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Room discount prices are for two people, and regular rates quoted are minimums: 
through April 30, $77.50 (regular rate $155). For the month of May, $60 
(regular rate $120). From June 1 to Sept. 30, $37.50 (regular rate $75). On 
Oct. 1, the rate becomes $60 (regular minimum $120). 
</P>

Many mature travelers are planning vacation trips that serve two purposes -- 
pleasure and relaxation, plus an opportunity to review various destinations as 
possible locations for retirement. National Retirement Concepts (NRC) has 
developed a series of such programs, which provide vacations with plenty of 
activities and a minimum of sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
NRC's tours are limited to U.S. destinations. Trips are offered to Arizona, 
Arkansas and North Carolina. Later this spring NRC will add South Carolina and 
two Florida trips, one to the East Coast and one to the west. 
</P>
<P>
None of the trips are tied in with any retirement community, and at each 
destination travelers are given tours of several such communities in order to 
make comparisons while they enjoy sightseeing and area attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The North Carolina tour offers eight days and seven nights of first-class 
lodging, plus daily breakfast, three special-event dinners and deluxe motor 
coach or mini-coach transportation throughout the visit. 
</P>
<P>
The land portion of this trip, including all of the above plus all taxes, tips 
and baggage handling, is $690 per person, double occupancy. Transportation to 
and from the destination is extra, and on request will be arranged at current 
available minimum cost by NRC. 
</P>
<P>
The two other tours, also for eight days, include full daily breakfast, four 
lunches and three special-event dinners, plus all of the features described 
above. Arizona is priced at $655, and the other to Arkansas is $695, per 
person, land portion only. 
</P>
<P>
For free brochures that list available dates and complete tour descriptions 
plus other information, call toll-free (800) 888-2312, or write to National 
Retirement Concepts, 1454 N. Wineland Court, Chicago 60610.

MONTEREY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month you can get an insider's look at California's most historic city. 
April 29 is the date of Monterey's 42nd annual Adobe Tour, when many buildings 
of the city's Spanish and Mexican eras will be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
On the self-guided walking tour you can view the interiors of 25 adobes that 
have been preserved over the decades. Among them is the 150-year-old Larkin 
House that originated the Monterey-Colonial style of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Special attractions include antique furniture, as well as clothing worn by 
Monterey residents in the 1800s. Early wardrobes will be on exhibit at the 
Pacific House and Doud House. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights are an outdoor breakfast and formal afternoon tea, plus an 
optional garden lunch and a wine and cheese party. A free trolley service will 
operate all day along the main tour route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Kind of Tour 
</P>
<P>
Even if you aren't able to join the Adobe Tour, visitors can tour Old Monterey 
by following a Path of History map to three dozen sites. Among them are nine 
adobes and other vintage buildings that are part of Monterey State Historic 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Near Fisherman's Wharf at Monterey's scenic waterfront is Custom House Plaza, 
where the park's visitor center is in the Pacific House. Used for military 
offices and storage when it was built in 1847, the two-story building houses a 
museum of California history and Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
At Pacific House you can buy a ticket for admission to six state park adobes, 
including four that feature guided tours on the hour (except at lunch time). 
Adults pay $3.50, children 6 through 17 pay $2. 
</P>
<P>
Also pick up a "Path of History" brochure to guide you around Old Monterey; 
round blue markers on the sidewalks show the route and street signs identify 
all the historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fine Mud Brick House 
</P>
<P>
Most recently restored is the Cooper-Molera Adobe, a multi-building complex at 
the south end of Alvarado Street. The main two-story structure was the finest 
mud brick house in town when it was built in 1850. On the stair banister's 
newel post, look for the deed button, a circle of abalone shell indicating that 
the mortgage has been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the furnished home is an income tax notice for 1863, when the tax 
rate was 3%. Tours are given between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.; closed 1 to 2 p.m. and 
Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Author Robert Louis Stevenson once lived nearby on Houston Street when he came 
to Monterey in 1879 to woo his future wife. At the time of his visit, the now 
famous Scot was unknown and sickly and could only afford one meal a day. 
</P>
<P>
Mementos of his life are displayed in several rooms of the Stevenson House, 
open for hourly tours except noon to 1 p.m., and Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Word in Architecture 
</P>
<P>
The hip roof, balcony and veranda that Thomas Larkin built on his house in the 
1830s started a building design that gave the word Monterey to the 
architectural world. Many original family items decorate the interior of the 
Larkin House, which you can tour except noon to 1 p.m. and Tuesdays; go to the 
corner of Calle Principal and Jefferson Street. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey style also is evident at the smaller Casa Soberanes that's behind a 
blue gate in a peaceful garden at Pacific Street and Del Monte Avenue. Its 
first owner was the commander of Monterey's Presidio, but the adobe is named 
for the Soberanes family that lived there from 1860 to 1922. Closed 1 to 2 p.m. 
and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south on Pacific Street, across an expanse of lawn, you'll see an 
imposing building that's stone instead of adobe and resembles New England 
architecture rather than Monterey style. Its portico is flanked by twin outside 
staircases that lead to the second floor, where California's constitutional 
convention was held in 1849. 
</P>
<P>
Colton Hall was the state's first public building, erected with convict labor 
and financed in part by taxes on liquor shops and fines paid by gamblers. It 
served as the county courthouse, then a school, and now is a museum of city 
history. Visitors are welcome daily without charge from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexican Food 
</P>
<P>
Not far from Colton Hall you can eat in an adobe that dates to 1841 and is part 
of Monterey State Historic Park. Enjoy Mexican fare indoors or in the courtyard 
at Casa Gutierrez, on Calle Principal near Madison Street. 
</P>
<P>
Back near the waterfront, also visit Custom House, Casa del Oro, the Whaling 
Station and California's First Theater. 
</P>
<P>
If you come to Monterey for the April 29 Adobe Tour, tickets cost $10, students 
$7; no charge for children under 12. Lunch is an additional $3.50, the wine and 
cheese party $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the 10 a.m.-5 p.m. tour can be bought in advance from its nonprofit 
sponsor, the Monterey History and Art Assn. Phone (408) 372-2608, or write to 
P.O. Box 805, Monterey 93942. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the tour, tickets will be available at Pacific House, where a 
baker's breakfast (pastries, orange juice and coffee) will be offered in the 
Memory Garden from 9 to 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Ticket Sites 
</P>
<P>
You also can buy a tour ticket at Larkin House, the Allen Knight Maritime 
Museum, Casa Serrano, site of the tea party from 1 to 5 p.m., and Cooper-Molera 
Adobe, where wine, cheese and musical entertainment will be offered from 1 to 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Junior League will serve lunch in the shady garden of the Old Whaling 
Station between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other events celebrating the Adobe Tour are an arts and crafts and antique show 
along Alvarado Street, a display of art needlework at the House of Four Winds, 
and the Central Coast Garden Show that runs three days at the Monterey County 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
For information about lodgings and restaurants, visit the Monterey Peninsula 
Chamber of Commerce in the 1849 Jacinto Rodriguez Adobe at 380 Alvarado St. Or 
call (408) 649-1770. 
</P>
<P>
Get to Monterey from Los Angeles by driving north on Interstate 101 and joining 
California 68 at Salinas. Round trip is 635 miles.

HER WORLD: THIS SPRING CLEANING LASTED DAWN TO DESK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On this day that feels like summer I am tackling the spring cleaning of my 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
Desk, in fact, is the word that I use for a computer table, bookshelf, china 
cabinet and the floor surrounding them. Desk, at this moment of my life, means 
a corner of the living room. 
</P>
<P>
My real desk -- and my real office -- are in the shadow of a war zone, a 
construction project of noise and dirt that will hang in the air for months. 
Had I not turned to travel writing 15 years ago, I would surely be signing up 
now. 
</P>
<P>
But before the next departure I shall tackle the teetering stacks of notes and 
menus, of matchbooks and marginalia, that have made my corner treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
Read and toss, as my sister says -- my sister, whose efficiency sometimes 
forces her to riffle through trash cans in search of bills and Valentines that 
she threw out unopened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Among the Best 
</P>
<P>
A best buy: Strands of African trade beads that I found at Garland's Indian Art 
and jewelry shop at Indian Gardens in Arizona's Oak Creek Canyon. A savvy woman 
named Ms. Maiden showed a great selection of beads, both ancient and modern. 
</P>
<P>
The long strands of earth-tone clay beads were $6 each. Sure, you could beat 
that price if you were in the right part of Africa at the right time, but I 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
A best breakfast: The fresh fare at the Woodstock Inn, in North Woodstock, 
N.H., is worth writing home about, which is what two of my pals did. They 
stayed in a cozy third-floor room of this blatantly pretty bed and breakfast, 
and raved about the waffles topped with raisins, pecans, honey, vanilla ice 
cream and strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
This homey haven should not be confused with the Rockefeller-owned Woodstock 
Inn in neighboring Vermont. But of course it sometimes is. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Waste of Time 
</P>
<P>
A worst hour: Though it seemed longer, my biggest waste of time so far this 
year was a ride on the rubber-wheeled Mark Twain train in Hannibal, Mo. The 
whiny guide, dressed in engineer's overalls, complained about his hangover 
while reading foolish commentary in a singsong voice. 
</P>
<P>
I was embarrassed for Mr. Twain, there in his hometown, and had to agree with 
the reaction of an elderly man we passed. He shifted his cane to a wrist so his 
hands were free to give the forefinger-brushing-forefinger sign, meaning "shame 
on you." 
</P>
<P>
I remember cringing at that sign from my grandmother, the same woman who read 
to me with gusto of the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
A primitive wonder: Having been met one dawn by the shouts of natives poling 
longboats on the muddy Agats River of New Guinea, I was awed by the collection 
in the Michael C. Rockefeller wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The spacious gallery houses a war canoe almost 50 feet long, and a soul canoe, 
filled with carved figures, that stretches for 20 feet. It is a stirring 
tribute to a gentle man who died too young. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exercise on the Road 
</P>
<P>
Favorite steps: The flower-lined climb from Government Hill in St. Thomas to 
Lille Tarne Gade (Danish for Little Tower Street) is called 99 Steps, though 
I've been too breathless to count. This narrow step-street dates to the 1700s, 
when the Virgin Islnds were owned by Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill in Boston claims 294 steps. I can't imagine how those figures came 
to be scribbled on the same page of my notebook . . . and I have a good 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
New York matchbook memories: The glow of candlelight on a platter of Chinese 
dumplings at Chin Chin on East 49th, where appetizers can make a meal; a light 
supper at The Ginger Man across the street from Lincoln Center -- just minutes 
before curtain time. 
</P>
<P>
And I've saved a scrap about a restaurant I've yet to try: Fiasco at 358 W. 
23rd St. They boast of "exquisite food, unbelievable prices." I wonder what 
they mean by "unbelievable?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Other Fond Memories 
</P>
<P>
Charming courtyards: Whether in city or country I like to celebrate spring by 
dining in a shady, cobbled courtyard or at a sidewalk cafe. 
</P>
<P>
In tiny Port Haliguen near Quiberon, on the rugged coast of Brittany, is a 
favorite creperie called Le Vieux Porte. The garden walls are thick with 
plate-size roses, both yellow and red. 
</P>
<P>
The crepes, which are native to Brittany, are just as large and filled with 
vegetables, seafood, cheese or chicken. For dessert there are sweet crepes 
filled with berries or chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
In London I treasure the courtyard behind the Red Lion Inn at the head of 
Charles Street in Mayfair. In warm weather it's a jolly place for a pub snack 
and a cool lager. 
</P>
<P>
On this day that feels like summer, my desk is still cluttered. But it's too 
lovely to stay indoors. I'll empty one waste basket and keep on walking.

CRAFTSMAN HOMES: 'SIMPLE LIVING AND HIGH THINKING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It comes to me every day of my life that a home spirit is being awakened 
amongst us, that as a nation we are beginning to realize how important it is to 
have homes that we like, that we have been instrumental in building." 
</P>
<P>
In these down-home phrases, Gustav Stickley, editor of The Craftsman magazine, 
promoted the Craftsman bungalow with its cedar shingle siding, deep roof eaves, 
ample porches, ground-hugging horizontal lines and dark, redwood interiors that 
swept Southern California between 1890 and 1920. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftsman style "established an American architecture so fresh that it 
spread from Pasadena to all of Southern California, and then all over the 
country," Esther McCoy wrote in "Five California Architects." 
</P>
<P>
At the height of its popularity the Craftsman house was so much in demand 
across the United States that some local architects set up lucrative mail-order 
operations that offered sets of plans for $1 "direct from Bungalow Land," as 
they called Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous Craftsman houses of Pasadena were designed by brothers Charles 
and Henry Greene. So many Greene and Greene houses -- the Gamble, the Blacker 
and the Duncan-Irwin -- were built along the Arroyo Seco that they were given 
their own name, the Arroyo style. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Greenes, other architects who led the Craftsman movement in 
Southern California included Myron Hunt and his partner, Elmer Grey; Sylvanus 
Marston, Louis B. Easton, Arthur and Alfred Heineman, Frederick L. Roehrig and 
George Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftsman bungalow embodied the ideal of "simple living and high thinking" 
popularized by the late-Victorian Arts and Crafts movement in the United States 
and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The Arts and Crafts movement appealed to genteel middle-class people who, 
repelled by the whole idea of the noisy, dirty, intrusive Industrial 
Revolution, yearned to live a life of semi-rustic simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arts and Crafts ideal, self-reliant family groups communed with nature 
or gathered around the fireplace in the evening and read poetry, played the 
piano, wove cloth or crafted timber for the houses they helped build with their 
own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple shingled bungalow, enriched with the most discriminating taste in 
painting and hand-crafts, was built by intellectuals . . . folksy in their 
attitudes toward family and the good life," historian Robert Winter wrote in 
"California Design 1910." 
</P>
<P>
Retreating into the safe, warm cave of the family home, the breadwinner would 
find refuge at the hearth from the labors of the day out in the brutal working 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The little lady would be busy in the efficient white kitchen at the back of 
the house, concocting healthful dinners from garden-grown vegetables," Winter 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"When she'd fed the family, she and her daughters might entertain the head of 
the household with an aria from Puccini, or a medieval madrigal, to soothe his 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modest to Grand 
</P>
<P>
The Craftsman bungalow -- a word derived from the Hindi bangla, a house in the 
Bengal style -- ranged from the modest to the grand. 
</P>
<P>
Many bungalows were designed and partly built by their owners. They were 
inspired by Stickley's belief that "Homes must be honest dwellings . . . (in 
which) every man has the right to think out the plan for his house to suit 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Dyer, in a 1912 article titled "How I Built My Bungalow," declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I decided not to engage an architect. I knew exactly what I wanted, and so 
often an architect will insist on incorporating his own ideas, and I just 
wanted us, my husband and myself, in the 'thought' of our home." 
</P>
<P>
Tile maker Ernest Batchelder, whose ceramics graced almost every classic 
Craftsman house built before World War I, also designed and built his own home 
at 626 S. Arroyo Blvd., Pasadena, in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Arroyo Stones 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder was attracted to the site by its mature trees and its location on 
the edge of the Arroyo Seco. The front porch frames a view of the magnificent 
100-year-old oak that spreads its protective canopy over the low-pitched 
tar-paper roof. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder crafted a cedar-shingled bungalow graced by round river stones from 
the arroyo. A second-story porch was designed to catch the sweet breezes 
wafting in from the San Gabriel Valley's orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
The living room, with its board-and-batten redwood wainscotting and Douglas fir 
sloped ceiling, is centered on the tiled chimney breast. The chimney is guarded 
by a pair of ceramic icons -- a trademark St. Mark's lion for Batchelder and a 
harp for his musician wife, Alice. 
</P>
<P>
The light from the windows on either side of the fireplace is softly muted. 
Chairs designed by Gustav Stickley sat waiting by the hearth for the evening 
family gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dark Interiors 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why the Craftsman interiors were so dark," said Winter, who 
bought the Batchelder house in 1972. "Maybe it was as a relief from the bright 
Southland sunshine?" 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Craftsman houses were dark was the influence of Japanese 
domestic architecture on West Coast house design. At the turn of the century 
the "Japanesque" mode was all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese influence on Craftsman architecture was also evident in the 
widespread use of wood inside and out, and in the way the wood was detailed. 
</P>
<P>
Massive fireplace mantles, often marked by the strokes of the adze, sported 
prominent dowels and lapped joints. The use of deep, overhanging eaves with 
curving ends was also Oriental in origin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Variant Styles 
</P>
<P>
The Japanesque was not the only, or even the most dominant, variation of the 
Craftsman style. More popular among design-it-yourself homeowners was the Swiss 
Chalet -- a blown-up version of the cuckoo clock. Other Craftsman homes 
followed the English Tudor or Cotswold tradition, or imitated Bavarian hunting 
lodges with their half-timbered stucco walls and steep, shingled roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that wood was scarce in Southern California, and very vulnerable to 
termites and dry rot, did not hinder its popularity. The warmth of redwood, 
cedar and Douglas fir was too attractive and too "natural" to be resisted by 
the devotees of Arts and Crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Today, all Craftsman houses need to be inspected annually for signs of termite 
attack or dry rot erosion. In many, the timber foundation posts are so eaten 
away they "float on a sea of termites," according to one Pasadena builder. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaping was an integral part of every Craftsman house, modest or grand. 
</P>
<P>
"The charm of the garden is not the monopoly of the rich," Eugene Murmann wrote 
in his 1914 monograph "California Gardens." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garden Suit House Style 
</P>
<P>
"It is not secured merely by the expenditure of money; it comes from the 
exercise of good taste and correct judgement in using the natural beauty to the 
greatest advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Murmann insisted that the design of the garden suit the style of the house. The 
Japanesque bungalows demanded landscaping with stone lanterns and meandering 
ponds. The Tudor style of Craftsman house needed an English rose and lily 
garden to complement its architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftsman style began to fade in popularity in the 1920s. In that era of 
postwar prosperity and Jazz Age extravagance, sheer ostentation drove out the 
ostentatious simplicity of the Arts and Crafts movement. 
</P>
<P>
Even the women's magazines, such as The Ladies Home Journal, which had done so 
much to spread the doctrine of the Arts and Crafts movement across middle-class 
America, abandoned the style in favor of the elaborate period revival modes 
that swept the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ideas Lived On 
</P>
<P>
The woodsy self-reliance of "simple living and high thinking" was replaced by 
the urbane luxuriance of neoclassical and Regency domestic architecture or the 
romantic Mediterranean amplitudes of the Spanish Colonial Revival. 
</P>
<P>
But the ideas that generated the Craftsman home lived on, reincarnated in the 
popular 1920s and 1930s California Bungalow, and in the post-World War II ranch 
house styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftsman ideal, if not the style, prefigured much of the moralistic thrust 
of Modern architecture as practiced by Bauhaus-influenced Southland designers 
such as Rudolph Schindler and Richard Neutra. 
</P>
<P>
The houses Schindler and Neutra designed for themselves and for early Southern 
California health-conscious types as Dr. Phillip Lovell in the 1920s and '30s, 
were also founded upon the open-planned interiors and the indoor-outdoor 
integration with nature that distinguished the Craftsman homes. 
</P>
<P>
For the early Modernists, as for the devotees of the Arts and Crafts movement, 
Stickley's famous credo served equally well: 
</P>
<P>
"It is my wish, my own final ideal, that the Craftsman house may . . . 
establish in America a higher ideal, not only of beautiful architecture, but of 
home life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO RECOGNIZE A CRAFTSMAN HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
Usually single story under low-pitched composition or tar-paper roofs with 
gabled ends, deep eaves and exposed timber joists. 
</P>
<P>
Porches and pergolas link the bungalow to its garden. 
</P>
<P>
Exteriors covered with cedar shingle siding. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent chimney stacks, usually brick or rough stonework. 
</P>
<P>
Interior walls lined with redwood board-and-batten wainscotting topped by a 
horizontal timber frieze. 
</P>
<P>
An open-plan interior with few divisions between the main living and dining 
room areas. 
</P>
<P>
Many built-in cabinets and fittings to reduce the clutter of free-standing 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Second-story sleeping porches or pool rooms, often later converted to enclosed 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Copper and stained-glass Japanese/Art Nouveau lamps and lanterns hung on 
wrought-iron chains. 
</P>
<P>
Stained-glass Art Nouveau door, screen and window panels in the more expensive 
bungalows.

AT HOME / SANTA ROSA VALLEY: SECLUDED VALLEY TRIES TO KEEP TO ITS RURAL ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS FEAR INFLUX OF NEWCOMERS WILL BRING SUBURBAN SPRAWL TO VENTURA 
COMMUNITY. 
</P>

<P>
These days in the Santa Rosa Valley, trucks hauling hay share the road with 
cement mixers, and giant wooden skeletons of half-built homes sprout where 
avocado and citrus groves once stood. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for garden-variety housing developments in this 24-square-mile 
valley, which is wedged between Moorpark and Thousand Oaks but isolated from 
the rest of Ventura County by hills. 
</P>
<P>
New homes here fetch from $500,000 to $1 million. Minimum lot size is an acre, 
and Spanish chateaux sit cheek by jowl with Tudor mansions and Santa Fe-style 
adobes. Many have long driveways, wrought-iron gates and guest houses. Some 
straddle mountain peaks with stunning views. Others have swimming pools, tennis 
courts and stables. 
</P>
<P>
When Dr. Jeffrey and Karen Sycamore moved here last year from Thousand Oaks, 
they opted for a Country French-style, custom-built house. The Sycamores, who 
were drawn to the area's rural, horsy ambiance, typify the new breed of 
residents who are making the little-known Santa Rosa Valley an increasingly 
popular place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many areas that are in the country like this and yet still close 
to the city," says Karen Sycamore, who is rearing six children from ages 4 to 
14 amid horse trails and grassy hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short Drive to Work 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, she adds, her husband is only 15 minutes away from Los Robles 
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, where he works as an 
anesthesiologist. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Meyer, who heads the Santa Rosa Homeowners Assn., bought a 5-acre spread 
15 years ago after numerous squirrel-hunting expeditions to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a ranch and I wanted to enroll my kids in a 4-H program," 
said Meyer, a physics teacher at Moorpark College who harvests a small avocado 
crop each year and keeps horses, pigs and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Staben, by contrast, is among the old-timers in this valley of about 
2,000 residents. She and her husband moved here in the late 1940s when it was 
predominantly agricultural, and have raised avocados and citrus on a 35-acre 
ranch ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Farming is our life. I was born on a farm and so was my husband," Staben said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transition to Residential 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed, and today the Santa Rosa Valley is a checkerboard of 
small farms and homes on acre lots, and friction between agriculture and 
residential growth is becoming an increasingly hot topic. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years ago, there were only six houses on our street," Staben said. "But 
now, we have houses on three sides of us and you can't continue to farm with 
people all around you." 
</P>
<P>
Staben's plight illustrates the transition under way in the Santa Rosa Valley, 
which is bounded by Moorpark Road on the east, Yucca Street on the west, 
Presilla Road on the north and the base of the Wildwood Park foothills on the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
For one, property values are going up faster than a crop of lettuce after a 
spring rain. 
</P>
<P>
"The lots out there have gone crazy," said Santa Rosa Valley realtor Jack 
Chiurazzi. An acre lot that cost $15,000 in the early 1970s now goes for 
$300,000. For existing homes, "absolute rock bottom means half a million 
dollars and 2.5-acre spreads can easily fetch more than $1 million," Chiurazzi 
added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Suburban Sprawl 
</P>
<P>
Already, some residents say the area has become a ranchy, rural Beverly Hills 
where property owners erect architectural marvels of 7,000 square feet or more 
on their acre parcels. And much as in Beverly Hills, some of the new homes are 
vastly over-scaled for the size of the lots on which they sit, longtime 
residents complain. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, after watching nearby Moorpark and other cities gobble up land and 
disgorge what they consider suburban sprawl, longtime residents and recent 
arrivals are worried that high-density builders are turning a hungry eye to 
their hidden valley. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the valley's future is prompting some hard analysis in Ventura 
County government, where planners are studying measures that could boost 
population in the Santa Rosa Valley by 25%. A group of farmers has petitioned 
the county to rezone their land from agriculture to residential, and an 
environmental impact report is under way. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal that has sparked the most debate is a plan by the family of 
actor Joel McCrea to build a 250-unit housing development, a small commercial 
center with a "village" theme and a trolley line that would close a portion of 
Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
The McCrea property lies just inside the city boundaries of Thousand Oaks, but 
the project would adjoin homes in the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closing Moorpark Road 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also require the closing of Moorpark Road at the Norwegian 
Grade, an incline reportedly named after the Norwegian families who settled 
there during the last century. It is the main thoroughfare for Santa Rosa 
residents traveling to Thousand Oaks to work or shop. 
</P>
<P>
(There isn't so much as a convenience store, industrial park or coffee shop in 
the exclusively residential Santa Rosa Valley.) 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners' President Meyer recently enlisted neighbors to write letters to 
Conejo Valley merchants warning that they will lose business if the Norwegian 
Grade closes. 
</P>
<P>
But Peter McCrea, who is handling the development for the McCrea family, 
maintains that the road should be closed because it's dangerous. At any rate, 
he predicts that the inconvenience would be minimal -- a 2 1/2- to 5-minute 
detour at worst. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings are scheduled later this year, Thousand Oaks planners say, but 
meanwhile, Ventura County Supervisor James R. Dougherty, who represents the 
Santa Rosa Valley, has come out in opposition to the grade's closure and says 
he plans to monitor the McCrea proposal closely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Preserve the Openness' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to preserve the openness out there, and if we have development, we 
want it to be open and spacious so that it's not just another suburb," 
Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
That would please Carol and Jack Mogler, who moved to the Santa Rosa Valley 
almost three years ago from Thousand Oaks with their children, now 14 and 17 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
She is a homemaker; he manages two manufacturing companies in Camarillo. They 
own a 5,400-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted more space around us, and this reminds us of back East where we came 
from many years ago," Carol Mogler said. "It's a wonderful community and very 
friendly. Peaceful. And we're just not that far from anything."

SAM HALL KAPLAN: A TOUR OF ENDANGERED LANDMARKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is no rest for preservationists in Los Angeles, bombarded as they are by 
conferences and crises. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand are expected to gather here this week at the 14th annual 
California Preservation Conference to review the movement's successes and 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled at the historic Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles are the usual 
symposiums to discuss the finer points of restoration, rehabilitation and 
recycling; the latest twists and turns in local land-use laws and landmark 
ordinances, and the drift of funding for preservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
To lighten the proceedings, conference planners are offering "L.A.'s Great Open 
House," featuring 19 tours of historic sites and scenes. They include the El 
Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park, the Long Beach and San Fernando 
Valley ranchos, Hollywood Boulevard, the movie studios, and historic houses and 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Not scheduled but appropriate would be another tour, "Endangered Landmarks," 
reflecting some of the harsh realities of preservation today. 
</P>
<P>
For despite the movement's achievements of the past decade and a rising public 
appreciation of preservation, development and economic pressures continue to 
mount, threatening historic buildings, districts and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The tour would start downtown, along Broadway, a national historic district. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the marvelous movie palaces there, exhibiting a range of exuberant 
architectural styles that flowered in the 1910s and 1920s, are on shaky 
financial grounds and worse for wear. A few simply aren't making it anymore and 
are primed to be picked off by speculators interested more in the value of 
their sites than the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The frail hope of such groups as the Miracle on Broadway is that the palaces 
will be saved under some sort of cultural resources plan, to be used as a dance 
gallery, rehearsal halls or small theaters to augment the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan would only consume a small fraction of the public and private funds 
earmarked for the center's latest expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the tour would be the Brockman Building and the former Coulter's Dry 
Goods store, both of which lend a sense of history and scale to 7th Street 
between Grand and Olive avenues. 
</P>
<P>
This delicately detailed Romanesque-style commercial strip dating back 70 years 
is threatened by a slickly packaged multi-use mega-project being planned by the 
local office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill for the Japanese investment firm 
of USA Pacific Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop would be the southeast corner of Lafayette Park Place and 3rd 
Street, for a glimpse of the ravaged McKinley Mansion, once a proud example of 
the rich Italian Renaissance style. Its owner was stopped from brazenly, and 
illegally, demolishing the structure over last New Year's weekend, but not 
before inflicting serious damage and opening it up to vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists hope that the damaged mansion can be moved to a location where 
it would be repaired and appreciated. Also obviously in need of repair are the 
city's ordinances to protect such landmarks from illegal demolition and to 
force the culprits to restore them. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the endangered tour would be the Menlo Avenue National Historic 
District, on Adams Boulevard in the North University Park area. 
</P>
<P>
The district is a rare street, lined with gracious two-story Craftsman-styled 
houses dating back to the turn of the century. Architectural delights, they are 
the focus of a valiant restoration effort to bring some desperately needed 
stability to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, under an ill-conceived and politically motivated plan, the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency is proposing to bulldoze much of the block to 
make way for a Boys Market. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that the site for the market could be adjusted to spare the 
landmark houses or another found in a neighborhood pockmarked with 
garbage-strewn vacant lots and liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently, local Councilman Robert Farrell wants the houses and their 
community-conscious residents to go, and has pressured the CRA to contradict 
its commitment to preservation as a tool for neighborhood renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The tour, unfortunately, continues. 
</P>
<P>
Among other stops is the Ambassador Hotel, Bishop Conaty High School, Queen of 
Angels Medical Center, the Whittier Theater and half a dozen branch libraries. 
Each is affected in some way by shifting economics, politics and public tastes 
and needs. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Ennis Brown House in Los Feliz, a Frank Lloyd Wright 
masterpiece that is slowly crumbling for lack of funds for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Getty Trust's architectural preservation program continues to 
perfect its application process. Perhaps if the program, instead of being 
housed in pricey office space, was relocated to the Ennis Brown House under a 
leaking roof and above a shaky foundation, a way would be found to 
expeditiously fund the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
More generally endangered is no less than a quarter of the entire city of South 
Pasadena; the Miracle Mile, both the commercial buildings along Wilshire 
Boulevard and many of the fine, dated apartment complexes off it, and Bonnie 
Brae Avenue, south of MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena the culprit is a poorly planned freeway; in the Miracle Mile 
and on Bonnie Brae Avenue, insensitive development, confused political 
leadership and ineffectual city planning. 
</P>
<P>
The list, and the tour, could go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
Many communities may not have a particular landmark of historic interest that 
is threatened, or indeed may not have a landmark at all. But their struggles to 
preserve, in their buildings and landscapes a sense of time, place and pride 
are to be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
It is these struggles for a livable city, built upon the fragments of the past, 
that will set the agenda of the preservation movement in the coming years, 
symposiums and tours not withstanding.

ANNUAL CONFERENCE INCLUDES RESTORATION DEMONSTRATIONS, TOURS FOR THE PUBLIC.

<P>
Grass-roots groups dedicated to preserving the dwindling remnants of 
architectural history in their neighborhoods will gather this week to recommit 
themselves to their goals at the 14th annual California Preservation Conference 
at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The public is invited to special events that include all-day demonstrations of 
restoration techniques Friday and Saturday, and 19 neighborhood tours next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Award Presentation 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 preservationists will participate in seminars on supportive federal 
legislation, local zoning practices and methods of organizing neighborhoods. 
Awards for preservation design will be presented. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't too long ago that politicians and government officials saw us as 
troublemakers, and developers branded us as obstructionists," said Milford 
Wayne Donaldson, president of the nonprofit California Preservation Foundation, 
main sponsor of the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, preservation is an idea whose time has come," said Donaldson, a San 
Diego architect who heads the coalition of about 200 grass-roots groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference focuses on historic preservation as a way to revitalize vintage 
neighborhoods and protect things of value that link our past to the present. 
</P>
<P>
"One look at the state Capitol in Sacramento or the dazzling palaces in Los 
Angeles' theater district or a 1925 roller coaster in San Diego, and we realize 
that new is not necessarily better." 
</P>
<P>
The conference chairman, historian Christy Johnson McAvoy, said that for the 
last six months she has been coordinating the efforts of 35 Southland groups 
assisting her with conference activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wealth of History' 
</P>
<P>
"With their help we've come up with a wide variety of opportunities for 
conference participants and the general public to view the wealth of historic 
structures and districts in the greater Los Angeles area," McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be something for everyone, from Victorian neighborhoods to movie 
studios to San Fernando Valley's ranchos. Most tours will provide refreshments 
or lunch." 
</P>
<P>
The intricacies of gilding, woodcarving, stained-glass making, marbleizing, 
ornamental plaster work and other architectural decorating techniques, some 
centuries-old, will be demonstrated all day Friday and Saturday by expert 
craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations, organized by Jean Farnsworth of the Workman and Temple 
Family Homestead Museum in the City of Industry, will be held at the exhibit of 
restoration resources in the Biltmore's Heinsbergen Room. A 
preservation-related book fair also will be held. 
</P>
<P>
"Participants (in the demonstrations) have worked on projects ranging from a 
Frank Lloyd Wright house to a historic courthouse to the Pasadena City Hall," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Farnsworth said there has been increased demand for the services of these 
experts by corporations opting to restore rather than destroy the old palaces 
of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time-Honored Finishes 
</P>
<P>
Even owners of newer homes are beginning to use time-honored finishes and 
ornamentation in their renovation projects, Farnsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the sources for restoration materials will be represented at the 
exhibit, including architectural terra cotta, intricate Victorian-style tin 
ceilings, a large selection of glass bricks, vintage hardware, embossed wall 
coverings and decorative ironwork. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION DESIGN AWARDS 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen projects were singled out as winners in a statewide preservation 
competition by a jury of architects and preservation officials. The jury 
reviewed 100 entries in six categories. Here are some of the Southland winners: 
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation Award 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Building, a 1906 reinforced concrete building at 400 S. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
Adaptive Re-Use Awards 
</P>
<P>
Federal Building, U.S. Court of Appeals: an 1882 Mission Revival landmark in 
Pasadena, once a popular resort hotel, later considered for demolition, was 
turned into a grand courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Union Pacific Railroad Depot: a 1904 Mission Revival station in Riverside, 
abandoned for about 20 years and ravaged by arson, was restored as a mixed-use 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Mission San Luis Rey: an 1815 mission in Oceanside, which suffered neglect in a 
succession of owners, was the focus of extensive preservation efforts. 
</P>

Jon Douglas didn't even attempt to address the real issue in At Issue (April 
2), which is the fact that brokers still make a flat 6% sales commission on the 
exorbitant prices of Westside homes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he simplistically stated the obvious, i.e., "most of us are . . . too 
busy to take on such tasks . . . providers of professional services can act in 
our best interests in situations where we may not be knowledgeable enough to 
represent ourselves." Can't argue with that, Jon. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Crystal Russell pointed out, there's been no increase in the 
broker's services that even approaches the skyrocketing increase in home 
prices. To the contrary, they can work less, and make much, much more -- simply 
because their commission hasn't changed. Moreover, demand is so great in this 
idyllic area that instead of having to beat the bushes for buyers, they have to 
fend them off. 
</P>
<P>
Relax, Mr. Douglas, we don't want to "eliminate the professional middle man." 
We really are too busy trying to make a living. All we're saying is, it's time 
to end the gravy train. If you and your industry aren't responsible enough to 
police yourselves and implement a sliding commission scale that descends as 
house prices ascend, I urge readers or regulators to end the real estate 
rip-off. If not, brokers will continue to sock it to homeowners.

LEIMERT LIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I appreciated the article about Leimert Park (At Home, April 2). 
</P>
<P>
According to your statistics, I am one of the 3.7% white residents of Leimert. 
I moved into the neighborhood very recently after having lived in apartments in 
Santa Monica, Westwood and West Hollywood. I now own my own home. 
</P>
<P>
A typical two-bedroom house in Leimert Park currently goes for about $160,000. 
For this type of money, there is no place in Los Angeles with the mix of 
convenience, location, neighborhood pride and simple straightforward beauty 
like Leimert. I can think of many neighborhoods on the Westside with far more 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
I invite Angelenos who have never been to this part of town to educate 
themselves. Come to Leimert for a Sunday drive and also check out the new 
shopping center and beautiful adjacent hillside neighborhoods of View Park and 
Windsor Hills. I guarantee a surprise.

CITYLINES: STUDENTS HELP TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While others are bemoaning the condition of public housing, a group of UCLA 
architecture and planning students are working with Nickerson Garden tenants to 
develop ideas on how the 1,066-unit project in South-Central Los Angeles can be 
made more livable. 
</P>
<P>
Various plans have been developed calling for increased security through better 
design and tenant involvement, more apartments and an array of cultural, 
commercial and child-oriented services. They are to be refined in continuing 
classroom exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, directed by two professors, Jacqueline Leavitt and Judith Shine, 
involves about 30 students. The tenant contingent is headed by Claudia Moore, 
Nora King, Gail Wilson and J. D. Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope is that we can set a precedent for the school and students to become 
more sensitized to the harsh realities of providing decent housing and 
services," Leavitt said.

ALL THE VACATION COMFORTS OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designed for comfortable, casual indoor/outdoor living, this rustic vacation 
home will complement any scenic setting, from mountains to shorelines. Two 
decks and expansive areas of glass at the rear of the home take advantage of 
the back-yard view. A stone fireplace, board-and-batten siding and cedar shakes 
give the home rugged appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Inside and out, this home has features rarely found in a recreational design. 
The carport provides shade and shelter while loading and unloading the car, and 
the garage offers secure storage space for boats and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is characterized by an open, multilevel floor plan that adds 
interest and definition to the 1,158 square feet of living space. Including the 
basement, the rooms are spread out over four levels. All the rooms, except the 
kitchen, have vaulted ceilings, and cedar paneling lines the walls throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The front entry deck leads to a short hallway, outlined by a railing, that 
overlooks the dining/living room and kitchen. Two bedrooms and a bath make up 
the first level, while the kitchen and combined living/dining room are four 
steps below. An open staircase leads to the uppermost level containing a third 
bedroom, a second bath and a private deck. A side entrance leads to the kitchen 
and the stairway to the partial basement. 
</P>
<P>
The open arrangement of the kitchen, dining and living rooms affords maximum 
enjoyment of the view outside. An 8-foot breakfast bar between the kitchen and 
living room provides seating for up to four people, with plenty of space left 
over for a dining table. The cozy fireplace is flanked by windows and backed by 
stone veneer extending to the peak of the ceiling. Sliding glass doors open to 
the 10-by-36-foot deck. 
</P>
<P>
This vacation home is designed with energy-efficient exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
Homestyles Plan Service offers a variety of specialized plan books, available 
at newsstands nationwide as well as full-sized, complete construction 
blueprints. Plan 25-C is featured in the "Homestyles Home Plans" book, Issue 
No. 891 ($4.95, including postage), along with more than 150 vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
A study plan, which shows all four exterior elevations of this design and an 
easy-to-read floor plan, is available for $9.95 (postage included). For a free 
informational brochure or to order plan books and blueprints, call (800)

HOLES, CRACKS IN PLASTIC WATERLINES EASY TO REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND, Distributed by Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I get my water from a well, and it must be fairly acidic. Over the years it has 
corroded and eaten away at the metal pipes and fittings in my plumbing system 
with an insatiable appetite. Whenever an old section goes bad, I replace it 
with plastic. And wherever the plastic goes in, corrosion has ceased. Plastic 
is immune to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
It is not, however, immune to other common causes of leaks, such as errant 
nails driven during remodeling or cracks due to freezing. Even so, when these 
leaks do occur in plastic, they're relatively simple to fix. 
</P>
<P>
NAIL HOLES: If you accidentally drive a nail through a wall and into a run of 
plastic pipe, the easiest way to patch the damage is with a coupling. This is a 
tubular connector that fits over the ends of two pipes to fasten them together. 
</P>
<P>
Saw the pipe in half, right through the hole. If there is enough give in the 
run of the pipe, you can then cement it back together, using an ordinary 
coupling in the usual way. 
</P>
<P>
Apply solvent cement to the ends of the pipe on both sides of the cut. Slip the 
coupling onto one piece of pipe until it bottoms out on the stop molded at the 
midpoint of the coupling. Then quickly pull the other piece of pipe back so you 
can slip it into the other end of the coupling. Press it into the coupling 
until it too bottoms out, give the coupling a quarter turn to distribute the 
cement and let set. 
</P>
<P>
This technique will usually work when you are dealing with the relatively small 
pipes used in your plumbing's supply system. When you get a hole in the heavier 
pipes of your drainage system, however, it's often difficult to maneuver the 
two pieces of pipe far enough apart to get the second end into the coupling. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, try a slip coupling. This is just like an ordinary coupling but 
it has no stop or shoulder molded inside. To use a slip coupling, slip it onto 
one of the ends of the cut pipe, and slide it back several inches away from the 
cut so you can apply a liberal coat of cement to the pipe on both sides of the 
cut (see sketch). Then slide the coupling back up so it is centered evenly over 
the cut. Give it a twist and let set. 
</P>
<P>
Not all pipe makers offer slip couplings. If you can't find one, get an 
ordinary coupling and grind away the stop inside, as shown. 
</P>
<P>
CRACKS: They are usually too long to repair with a single coupling. One 
solution is to cut away the damaged section, then replace it with a short 
length of pipe fitted with couplings at both ends. A second solution is to make 
a patch with a piece of plastic pipe one size larger than the pipe that's 
cracked. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, a 1/2-inch line cracks, you can repair it with a length of 
3/4-inch pipe. Just cut a piece of the larger pipe long enough to lap past the 
damage a few inches in both directions. Then take a saw and split this piece of 
pipe in half lengthwise. 
</P>
<P>
Next, apply a heavy coat of cement to both the outside of the damaged pipe and 
to the insides of the repair pieces. Place the two halves of the repair pipe 
over the damage, orienting the seams in the patch so they do not line up with 
the crack in the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, squeeze the patch tightly in place with two or three hose clamps, or 
by twisting a few lengths of heavy wire around the repair with pliers.

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DISCUSS FENCE WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We want to build a fence on our property. The lot adjoins that of our 
neighbor's. Do we have to get permission to erect the fence? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: First of all, the fact that you are asking the question raises the 
possibility that you are not on good terms with the neighbor who will be 
affected by the fence. But if that supposition is wrong, contact him and see 
whether you can agree on the kind and height of the fence. But that is by no 
means the last word on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all communities have regulations on all matters affecting fences even if 
the one you contemplate will be completely on your own property. You must get a 
permit after the authorities are certain you intend to conform to the local 
codes. Whatever your reason for putting up the fence, make sure it is 
attractive. An eyesore isn't going to do anybody any good. 
</P>
<P>
Read Instructions When Using Adhesives 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there some rule of thumb that can be used when working with adhesives? In 
the past, when using adhesives, I have found it difficult to know when to use 
one kind of adhesive and when to use another. Can you help? I especially am 
anxious to find out when the so-called flexible adhesives should be used and 
when they should not. 
</P>
<P>
A: It sounds as if you are not an avid reader of the instructions on the 
adhesive containers. This is partly the fault of the manufacturers, who 
sometimes have the instructions in such small type that a magnifying glass is 
required to read them. 
</P>
<P>
But, no matter how difficult it is to make out the instructions, you should 
make it your business to see what they say. Generally, a flexible adhesive is 
required when the two objects to be joined are made of different materials; as 
for instance, when joining wood to glass. That's because different materials 
expand and contract differently when there is a change in the weather. With an 
adhesive that is inflexible, this can cause trouble. But nothing takes the 
place of reading the instructions and following them to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Ground Hard Use Base for Concrete 
</P>
<P>
Q: I intend to put down a concrete floor soon. Is there some way to tell when 
to use a base of aggregates and sand and when it can be skipped? Years ago, 
when I did this a couple of times, I guessed wrong both times. 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally, a base is needed if the ground is fairly soft. You can proceed 
without a base only if the ground is hard. Even when it is, it should be 
compacted. If there is any doubt in your mind about the hardness of the soil, 
put down the aggregate and sand, with about four times as much aggregate as 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
Dark Colors Make Roof Less Towering 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently bought a house in the country for use as a vacation or second 
home. It has a very steep roof. Since it is due for reroofing, we wonder 
whether there is any special color that will tend to make the roof lines seem 
somewhat lower. We intend to use asphalt shingles. 
</P>
<P>
A: Just be sure to select shingles that are dark in color. A dark color makes a 
high roof seem less towering.

INTERIORS: BORDERS: THEY'RE NOT JUST FOR WALLS ANYMORE; 
</P>
<P>
PAPER OFFERS DECORATING POSSIBILITIES ON CEILINGS, FURNITURE, DOORS AND EVEN ON 
THE FLOOR.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
They're off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're on furniture, ceilings, around windows, on closet doors and even on 
the floor. And the decorating possibilities on the wall are more creative than 
ever before. 
</P>
<P>
They're wall-covering borders, and they're one of the hottest looks in home 
fashions today, reports the Western Wallcovering Distributors Assn. (WWDA). 
</P>
<P>
Borders, which have been available for many years, have surged in popularity as 
consumers and decorators recognize the versatility and nearly limitless 
decorating possibilities they offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classic to Contemporary 
</P>
<P>
Available in styles and colors to coordinate with wall-covering patterns that 
range from classic to contemporary to country, borders can be found to suit the 
infant, active teen, cook or man of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Patterns can even be found to reflect the resident's personality or hobby, 
adding a bit of whimsical charm to a room, such as teddy bears, soccer players, 
cooking utensils or mallard ducks. Colors span clean neutrals to soft pastels 
to bold primaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Borders are ideal for the person who's using wall covering for the first time. 
They're economical, pre-trimmed, easy-to-hang and easy to update," according to 
Peter Hermann, vice president of design for Imperial Wallcoverings. "Moreover, 
many are pre-pasted and strippable or peelable for easy application and 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
"Borders can do for a room what the right scarf can do for a plain dress: give 
it a dose of color, dress it up, and add to its creative potential. They're 
also one of the simplest and fastest ways to give a room a face lift -- even on 
a budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Their Thinking 
</P>
<P>
"Borders can also provide solutions to many of a room's decorating problems. 
They can create architectural interest, emphasize a room's unique architectural 
elements, tie a room together or even hide a room's imperfections." 
</P>
<P>
Hermann advises the do-it-yourselfer to open up their thinking when working 
with borders and not be limited to traditional applications. Here are some 
starter ideas from Hermann and WWDA: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Apply a wide wall-covering border on plywood to create an unusual window 
valance. For added drama, extend the valance with the border around the room or 
use a coordinating fabric in the room's accent pillows or fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Create an easy stencil look by applying a stencil-type wall covering on 
kitchen cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dramatize a dull window by framing it with wall covering borders, and 
running the border around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Borders make a natural frame. Create architectural details in a boxy room 
by framing doors and windows, or even a picture or mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dramatize a fireplace by making it a room's focal point, placing a border 
above the mantel or around the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Too-high ceiling? Bring a room down to size by applying a wall-covering 
border at the wall height you prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tie a room together by trimming a room's accessories and accent pieces -- 
such as a lamp shade, window shades, planters, shelves, bookends and blotters 
-- with a border in a coordinating color and pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outline a window seat and alcove with borders. Use coordinating fabrics for 
throw pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Create an inexpensive chair rail effect by running one of the popular wide 
borders around a room at chair level. For a wainscotting effect, hang 
coordinating wall coverings above and/or below the border. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For a child's room, add color by trimming toy boxes, hampers, chests of 
drawers with borders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Create an inexpensive headboard by framing the headboard area with a 
border. Fill in headboard area with a coordinating wall covering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Create your own custom "rug" by gluing a rectangle cut from a roll of wall 
covering to a wood floor and edge with an accenting border. Coat with 
polyurethane for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accent dormers with borders mounted on plywood strips for a dimensional 
effect. 
</P>
<P>

covering, send $1 for postage and handling to Western Wallcovering Distributors

IMMIGRATION AND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING A COMMUNITY FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My father was an immigrant," Monterey Park Police Capt. Joe Santoro said. "He 
came through Ellis Island from Italy. He once said to me: 'Son, it's easy to be 
a prince, if your father was a king.' " 
</P>
<P>
For people born in America, Santoro said, "it's easy to say, 'Be an American.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations last week, 
a dozen speakers detailed the triumphs and failures faced by newcomers trying 
to become Americans in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Santoro, for example, put his father's comments into the context of today's 
Asian and Latin migration. Based on a study he conducted in 10 cities across 
the nation, Santoro told how law enforcement has much to learn about Asian 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
With statistics and anecdotes, other speakers at Alhambra's City Hall Wednesday 
dealt with such topics as social relations, education, housing and 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Morris Kight said the 15-member body held the hearing 
because it had received reports of much "rancor" in the western San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard many problems, but it is defeatist to consider racial diversity 
as simply a problem," Kight said at the hearing's conclusion. "It needs to be 
treated as a great opportunity for the enrichment of society." 
</P>
<P>
The number of residents of Asian ancestry in the region, Kight said, had more 
than doubled in the eight-year period ending in 1987, for a total of 180,000. 
The percentage of whites has dropped but still constitutes a majority, he said, 
while the Latino population has remained stable. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is we now have wave after wave of immigrants," Santoro said. "Unless 
we're able to deal with that . . . we're going to wind up with a community out 
there that doesn't have confidence in government." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the hearing, Kight said, the commission will make recommendations to 
the County Board of Supervisors on possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Here are edited excerpts from some of the speakers: 
</P>
<P>
Human Services 
</P>
<P>
Gladys Lee, director of the Asian Pacific Family Center, a mental health 
counseling agency in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing fear that Asians are taking over the San Gabriel Valley. 
That makes it more difficult for Asian newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
When we were established in 1986, schools and police welcomed us with open 
arms. But on a negative side, some non-Asians said: "My grandfather came from 
Europe. He made it without help." 
</P>
<P>
The Asian-Pacific community has serious problems. Many youngsters reject their 
heritage, hunger to be American and acculturate at an unhealthy rate, 
threatening their parents. Adults who had no previous psychiatric problems in 
their home country develop severe depression and paranoia. It is hard for Asian 
parents to understand that corporal punishment, which they used effectively in 
their homeland, can be considered child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly Asian-Pacifics are virtually without services. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising is difficult because of the stereotype that Asians are wealthy, 
that we are the model minority. 
</P>
<P>
Solutions: Encourage those of Asian ancestry to feel more comfortable in 
seeking counseling. Develop a program to combat stereotypes of Asian-Pacifics. 
</P>
<P>
Politics 
</P>
<P>
Richard Santillan, professor of ethnic and women's studies, Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Minorities are trying to become part of the political club. But racial 
discrimination is still a problem. One of the problems is at-large elections. 
</P>
<P>
We vote by district for our legislators, Board of Supervisors and some school 
boards, but not for most city councils. It's a sad commentary that cities with 
populations that are 50% Latino have only one on the city council. Asian 
representation is also low. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the biggest breakthrough came when the U.S. Supreme Court found (that) 
Watsonville's system of at-large elections was discriminatory. That means 
cities will confront lawsuits and an unfortunate amount of racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Some city council members would be elected at-large, while other 
members would be elected from single-member districts to guarantee that 
individual neighborhoods are represented. 
</P>
<P>
Law Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Joseph Santoro, Monterey Park Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, a teacher brought a child to police with a ring of welts around 
his chest and neck. According to our standards, this is child abuse. Not 
knowing what this was, we arrested the parents. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, this is a traditional method of healing, called coining, where 
you take a hot spoon or coin and pinch the skin. The intent is to relieve flu 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
We have a dilemma. We have a criminal justice system that says this is child 
abuse. Child abuse is an act of violence. This is an act of love. But it's not 
right, according to our standards. How do you deal with that? We should 
understand it and have the proper social service agencies to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
What about delinquent children? 
</P>
<P>
What happens if a child speaks little English? What if the child does speak 
English and the parents don't? What social services are in place to deal with 
language and cultural issues? There are few, and only one in the San Gabriel 
Valley, the Asian Pacific Family Center. It has only one social worker who 
speaks Mandarin, one who speaks Cantonese and one who speaks Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
These are major issues that simply are not being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park 
</P>
<P>
Francis Hong, human relations commissioner in Monterey Park and the chief 
executive officer of Connex Enterprises, an international food import-export 
business in Monterey Park and Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
Are the residents in Monterey Park responsible for all the tensions we have 
today? Could we fairly blame the old-time residents when they protested that 
they could not find the restaurant they liked, when they could not shop in 
Monterey Park? Could they still find their old drugstore on the corner? It's 
being replaced, everyday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, could we blame the new Asian immigrants for speaking their 
own language, following their own diet? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we can't blame. 
</P>
<P>
A lesson to be learned by neighboring cities: City government should set the 
tone in dealing with massive social changes. Council members should set the 
example that we can coexist, regardless of ethnic background. City councils 
should ease the pain for the old-time residents and should welcome the new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Transitions 
</P>
<P>
John Horton, a UCLA sociology professor who is conducting a sociological study 
in Monterey Park funded by UCLA and the Ford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park is a town in transition from a middle-American, racially mixed, 
bedroom community to a financial and service center for a large, regional 
Chinese population. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic and population growth have undermined old political structures. 
Given the ethnic diversity, no one group can control city government or the 
solutions to city problems. 
</P>
<P>
Growth is a No. 1 issue in Monterey Park and the San Gabriel Valley. In a city 
where growth often has a Chinese face, some established residents in the 
slow-growth movement translate that into targeting Chinese. But the slow-growth 
movement includes a large spectrum of people. 
</P>
<P>
New immigrants or minorities may not be aware of the ideological differences 
among established residents and may perceive slow-growth and the 
foreign-language restriction movements as identical because the leadership and 
political candidates tend to be white. 
</P>
<P>
Race and ethnicity is important as a personal and social identity in a changing 
situation. But we have to be aware of overemphasizing its importance. We also 
have to be aware of only focusing on conflict. The day-to-day political reality 
in a town like Monterey Park cannot just be summarized by the term conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise is, given all the news stories about conflict, that we didn't see 
more of it. And it isn't always racially or ethnically based. 
</P>
<P>
Orientation 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Fernandez Palmer, executive director, El Centro de Accion Social, a 
Pasadena social services and educational agency. 
</P>
<P>
There is a need for orientation programs for immigrants. But unfortunately, 
many programs either try to obliterate an individual's language or cultural 
background or try to assimilate them too quickly into American society. 
</P>
<P>
Education 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Peppin, superintendent of the Alhambra City and High School Districts, 
which encompasses Alhambra, San Gabriel, Monterey Park and Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years we have been relatively gang-free. But we're beginning to 
see increases. We recently have had elementary students recruiting for gang 
activity. We had one major incident between Latino and Asian students where one 
young man was stabbed off campus, but it created friction on campus. 
</P>
<P>
We are involved with the National Conference of Christian and Jews and other 
community groups in an attempt to address the problem. We have a strong peer 
counseling program, a human relations committee and multicultural discussions 
in schools. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to find Vietnamese-speaking teachers. A large number of students 
leave school and go home, where there is no parent. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Counseling programs aimed at specific groups. Making the district's 
Chinese-, Spanish- and Vietnamese-speaking staff more available to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Housing 
</P>
<P>
Luis Sahagun, president of Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be very little affordable housing in the western San Gabriel 
Valley. Housing prices jumped 30% from 1987 to 1988. The price of single-family 
housing far exceeds the financial abilities of many residents and prevents them 
from becoming first-time homeowners. It also prevents current residents from 
moving up to higher priced homes in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Former single-family lots have become multifamily. This has contributed to 
population growth and has created traffic problems. Waste-water treatment 
facilities are inadequate to meet the existing, much less future, housing 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
Education 
</P>
<P>
Roger Temple, superintendent of the Garvey School District, which includes 
Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel and South San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Limited English-speaking students at the third-grade level have increased in 
five years from 44% to 56%. 
</P>
<P>
There have been subtle changes, too. 
</P>
<P>
Far fewer Asian parents than Latino parents consider it important to attend 
parent conferences, open houses or PTA committees. Volunteerism is foreign to 
Asian parents. They tend to leave the school alone but support its efforts. 
Asian parents are more likely to be married: 93% compared to 72% for Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Hire more bilingual teachers. We provide bilingual incentives: a $600 
bonus to join the system and an extra $1,400 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
Jose Calderon, president of the San Gabriel Valley League of United Latin 
American Citizens and UCLA graduate student conducting a sociological study in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of cooperation. Our research reveals the seeds of beginning 
friendships and ties between Latino and Asian families in sports clubs, civic 
groups, PTAs and school events, out of the way places that the media will not 
look at. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation 
</P>
<P>
Viggen Davidian, principal transportation engineer of the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Nine major freeways cross the western San Gabriel Valley and are among the 
oldest and most congested in Southern California. Topography limits the number 
and capacity of surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
Each year traffic increases on freeways by 2 1/2% and on surface streets by 4 
1/2% to 5%. An estimated 130,000 trips are made each day on buses. That's more 
than in Orange County. Only 37% of the residents who have jobs work in this 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Projected conditions for the year 2010: Population will jump by 27%. This area 
is in the middle of the county. Most of the jobs in the county are projected 
for the west and south, while most of the population growth will occur in the 
east. That will create a traffic bottleneck in the western San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The average freeway speed in peak traffic times will drop from 37 m.p.h. to 
about 26 m.p.h. Forty minutes of every travel hour will be spent in congested 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Solutions: Ride-sharing, alternate work sites, flexible work schedules and rail 
transit. Direct bus routes between the San Gabriel Valley and the San Fernando 
Valley.

TO FIND MOTORISTS DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PARAMOUNT WANTS DRUG CHECKPOINTS SET UP 
</P>

PARAMOUNT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a continuing fight to rid the community of drug trafficking, city officials 
want to set up checkpoints to find motorists driving under the influence of 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoints would be similar to sobriety stations used by various police 
agencies looking for drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have asked the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which 
provides law enforcement service to the city, to set up the checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to let people know that this is not the place to do it (use 
drugs). We also hope to show residents this city is going to deal with the 
problem," City Manager William A. Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Drug Problem 
</P>
<P>
Holt said the checkpoints are part of the city's effort to battle a drug 
problem in one of its neighborhoods. Last month, undercover sheriff's deputies 
arrested 56 people on drug charges in the 15300 block of Gundry Avenue. The 
charges included possessing, selling and purchasing rock cocaine. The city 
closed of a portion of the street by building a concrete storm drain to create 
a cul-de-sac. Two deputies on bicycles now patrol the area. 
</P>
<P>
City officials believe this is the first time a community has requested that a 
checkpoint be established to look specifically for people under the influence 
of a drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is reviewing the city's proposal, said Lt. Robert 
Mirabella of the Lakewood sheriff's substation. Narcotics and traffic experts 
must determine whether there have been enough drug-related accidents to justify 
the roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
At sobriety checkpoints, deputies have cited drivers for driving under the 
influence of alcohol and drugs, but this may be the first time a checkpoint 
would be established primarily to check for drivers impaired by drugs, 
Mirabella said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack R. Winkler, assistant attorney general, has informed city officials that 
the California Supreme Court ruled in a 1987 case that it would be legal to 
conduct police roadblocks as long as the purpose was to remove impaired 
motorists who endanger others. However, Winkler said the court held that these 
checkpoints could not be used as a means of stopping vehicles and searching for 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary objective of the sobriety checkpoint is to take drivers (who are 
under the influence) off the road. It can't be used to search for evidence," 
Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said the city would follow the guidelines established by the court, which 
include notifying the public about the checkpoints in advance and using a 
formula, such as stopping every fourth car. 
</P>
<P>
"We always believe that the narcotics checkpoints modeled after the alcohol 
checkpoints were constitutional," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hoffman, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Southern 
California chapter, said the organization opposes checkpoints and does not 
believe the government should be able to stop people without a reasonable 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hoffman added, "It is hard to criticize Paramount without knowing how 
it works. We'll have to look into it to see that the program is monitored." 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Robinson, city director of public safety, said the city hopes the 
checkpoints will be set up in two or three weeks. Holt also said it was 
uncertain how often the checks would be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have not decided upon a location but it probably will be in an area 
near the Gundry Avenue, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, deputies trained in the detection of both alcohol and narcotics 
will be at the checkpoints, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics experts would be looking for such signs as involuntary eye jerking, 
dilated or constricted pupils, confusion and slurring speech. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bowers, assistant district attorney, said if officers determine by 
observation or a field sobriety test that a person is under the influence of 
some substance other than alcohol, a urine or blood test could be administered 
to detect the type of drugs.

LONG BEACH IS ROUNDING UP, RETURNING TRUANTS TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teen-ager was fast asleep when Long Beach Officers Jack Pletka and Larry 
Laingor walked into his bedroom and shook him. The boy's mother stood nearby, 
but that morning she wasn't giving the orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Get dressed," Laingor said as the surprised youth gazed up at the uniformed 
officer. "You're going to school." 
</P>
<P>
Pletka and Laingor don't usually pay house calls in their search for students 
skipping school. Most days, they and 10 fellow officers cruise around schools 
and through alleys, stopping at burger joints, the beach and other teen-age hot 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of the sleeping teen-ager, they responded to pleas from the 
boy's frustrated mother. "She was at her wit's end," Laingor recalled. "They 
lived by Belmont Shore and he was just taking his surfboard and going out." 
</P>
<P>
Truancy is taken seriously in Long Beach, where city police officers such as 
Pletka team up with school district attendance control officers such as 
Laingor. Local officials tout the 44-year-old anti-truancy program as the 
oldest of its kind in the state and say it is unique because it combines police 
and school district officers in patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent on Weekly Sweeps 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, police have cracked down on truancy by sending most of the 
department's juvenile division, about 30 officers, on three-hour weekly sweeps. 
Police Chief Lawrence Binkley started the sweeps because he believes the 
technique helps lower daytime crime. 
</P>
<P>
Between September, 1987, and February, 1988, police picked up 1,174 youngsters 
who belonged in schools in Long Beach or a nearby city. But since the sweeps 
began last September the number has more than quadrupled to 5,006 truants. The 
district has 67,107 students, of which approximately 58,800 are in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures Contradictory 
</P>
<P>
Although the dramatic increase in the number of students picked up could 
indicate a serious problem, the district traditionally has had a low rate of 
unexcused absences, which include truancy. Last year, 2.3% of the district's 
high school students and 3.3% of the junior high students were absent without 
an excuse, according to Lewis Prilliman, the district's director of research. 
</P>
<P>
But school board member Jerry Shultz said that the high numbers from the recent 
sweeps indicate many more students are cutting class and getting away with it. 
That not only means the students lose a chance to get an education, but the 
district loses money that the state allocates based on enrollment. During the 
1987-88 school year, the district lost about $4.1 million because of unexcused 
absences, which includes truants and children on vacation or religious 
holidays, according to Prilliman. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are out there but we're not picking them up," Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said he plans to urge the board to set up a district police department. 
School police would carry weapons, be empowered to make arrests and have the 
authority to stop and search students. Shultz also is working with school 
administrators on a plan that would force students who are suspended to attend 
a special education program, Project Stars. Rather than sitting at home, they 
will be in a strict classroom-type setting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The key," Shultz said, "is discipline." 
</P>
<P>
The joint city-school district patrol teams "do an excellent job -- when they 
have time to do it," said Shultz, who works as a Los Angeles County deputy 
sheriff. "But what I've been hearing from the grapevine is that they spend most 
of their time on (police) calls" instead of looking for truants, Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Police Sgt. Chris Marino, the six teams of police and school 
officers do not typically respond to service calls. But "if there was a robbery 
nearby or if they got a call for backup, they're policemen and they'll have to 
answer that," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
But usually, Marino said, "the only calls they spend their time on are related 
to schools." Truancy is a big part of that job. They also respond to calls 
about child abuse and other matters related to youngsters, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Have Own Police 
</P>
<P>
Most of the state's largest school districts have their own police, Shultz 
said. Long Beach Unified School District is the third largest in California. 
The local school district once maintained a force of officers who, when on 
duty, had the same authority as police. Five years ago, the Legislature ordered 
districts to choose between their own security department or police department, 
according to Carl A. Cohn, attendance service office director. The Long Beach 
district opted for security officers. 
</P>
<P>
Marino said Long Beach police do not object to Shultz's plan. "Whatever they 
want to do is fine with us," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
But school board President Harriet Williams and member Bobbie Smith questioned 
recently whether the district could afford a police department. Williams said 
the board chose five years ago to hire security officers instead of creating a 
police department partly because of the cost. Shultz could not say how much the 
change would cost, but he suspects it would not be substantially more than what 
the district is already paying for its security officers. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Tom Giugni said he opposes a new police department because "I'm 
not certain how much it will do for us. We have a concern (about truancy), and 
we believe that what we're doing is successful. And we can't let up on it." 
</P>
<P>
Pletka and other anti-truancy officers contend that the current system gives 
both the city and the school district their money's worth. Pletka said the mere 
presence of the officers on the street discourages gang fights and crimes. 
Sometimes officers even get a chance to steer a youngster onto the right path, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, while we were sitting at a restaurant," Laingor recalled, "a kid 
came up to us and said that we picked him up (years ago) and took him to the 
truancy center, and it really changed him." 
</P>
<P>
Students picked up by police are taken back to school, where the penalty often 
translates into after-school detention, or to the truancy center downtown, 
where they are counseled and often released to their parents. Students are not 
suspended for truancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids," Pletka said, "you catch them just in time. They're still afraid of 
doing something wrong. Maybe they're afraid of authority. (But) when they don't 
have any respect for themselves, then you can't save them." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday, Pletka and Laingor netted most of their truants around 
lunch time. 
</P>
<P>
During a quick stop at a Jack-in-the-Box hamburger stand, for example, they 
found three students eating french fries. Two of them did not have a school 
pass that would have permitted them to be off campus, and that got them an 
unsolicited free ride back to their school in the back of the officers' patrol 
car. Once at Millikan High School, Assistant Principal Bob Brooks greeted them. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen you in here before," Brooks said to a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's my first time," the youth replied. 
</P>
<P>
But Brooks was surprised to see a 17-year-old again. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've seen you since our last talk," Brooks said. 
Turning to the officers, the assistant principal said, "This young man, since 
he became a senior, 99.9% of the time he has made good decisions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I expect you to be here, not hopping fences," Brooks warned. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks let the high school senior go back to class without a penalty. His 
friend, the 16-year-old, however, was sent to a detention room by another 
assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
Most teen-agers interviewed recently seemed to take the officers' questioning 
in stride. One girl was on her way to Jefferson Junior High School when the 
officers stopped her. Although she's 13, they thought she looked older and 
belonged at Wilson High School. She showed them proof that she is a Jefferson 
student. The officers wished her a good day and sent her on her way. The 
eighth- grader later said, "I wasn't really scared. I just thought it was 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
More police departments are considering truancy sweeps. Earlier this year, for 
example, the Laguna Beach Police Department announced it had begun periodic 
sweeps to round up truants. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court last year let stand a California court ruling that 
allows police to stop and question suspected truants. That ruling stemmed from 
a 1983 Newport Beach case in which a Fullerton youth was stopped by police and 
asked why he was not in school. After further inquiries, officers found that 
the youth was carrying LSD under his jacket and they arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, officials also are looking at another program to help reduce 
truancy and provide an alternative to short-term suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after a program in Inglewood, the proposed Project Stars would 
probably be housed in a church or a business, according to the school 
district's Cohn. Rather than leave students idle in the truancy center or alone 
to wander by themselves when suspended, Project Stars would provide students 
with extensive counseling and make-up studies to help them get back on track, 
said school board member Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
Because the program is only in the planning stage, neither Cohn nor Shultz 
could say how much it would cost or how the district would pay for it.

Veteran Councilman Tom Clark plans to challenge Mayor Ernie Kell for the city's 
top elected post next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a tough campaign, but I have a lot of support," Clark 
said last week in announcing his candidacy for the April 8, 1990, election. 
</P>
<P>
Citing crime and police-related matters as the city's top priorities, Clark 
said he supports the controversial concept of creating an independent body to 
investigate allegations of police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, 62, had considered running against Kell in last year's race, but bowed 
out to support Councilwoman Jan Hall after initial surveys showed she had a 
better chance of beating the popular Kell. Hall, however, was soundly defeated 
last June as Kell walked away with 60% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Expensive Race 
</P>
<P>
Last year's election, the first in which voters selected a full-time mayor, 
became the city's most expensive, and next year's race promises to come close, 
if not surpass the $1 million spent on campaigning. Kell, who spent about 
$600,000 to beat Hall, said he may spend about the same. Clark said his budget 
will be closer to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kell expressed optimism about his chances for reelection, adding that Clark, 
his longtime political foe, "will have a difficult time finding people who are 
displeased with the direction the city is taking." 
</P>
<P>
Upon being told of Clark's announcement, Kell launched into a recitation of his 
achievements -- providing a glimpse of the campaign speeches to come. Among 
other things, Kell cited creation of the city's Office of Education and Office 
of Neighborhood and Historical Preservation. Kell conceived both as campaign 
issues last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark said there are many who are displeased with what they perceive as 
Kell's lack of leadership. According to a recent poll conducted on Clark's 
behalf, 33% of 300 registered voters would support Kell's reelection. The poll, 
conducted by Moore Information of Portland, Ore., asked whether Kell performed 
well enough to deserve reelection, or whether it is time to give another person 
a chance to do better. 
</P>
<P>
Clark declined to disclose the percentage of respondents who said they would 
vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Council 23 Years 
</P>
<P>
Clark, an optometrist who has served on the council for 23 years, said that he 
has taken a "more pro-active" stance than Kell on a number of issues through 
the years. He noted, for example, that he was the first to propose developer 
fees to create more parks, and to ask for an increase in the hotel room tax to 
support the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he has long considered running for mayor, and his decision 
apparently did not surprise Kell, among others. "He's been running ever since I 
beat Jan," Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was one of the early supporters of creating the full-time, elected 
position to replace the ceremonial mayoral position that, until last year, was 
filled by a council member chosen by his or her colleagues. As the elected 
mayor, Kell is paid $67,500 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Both served previously in the ceremonial position; Clark was mayor three times 
and Kell was mayor twice. In 1984, the contest between the two men became 
heated when the council split 4-4 until a ninth councilman broke the tie in 
Kell's favor. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's first term was limited to two years to allow future mayoral 
elections to coincide with those of other elected citywide offices. The mayor 
will serve a four-year term in the future.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
UNIFORM POLL CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 238 for and 154 against, the House passed a bill requiring polls 
to close at the same time in presidential elections in all states except Alaska 
and Hawaii. The bill was sent to the Senate. Voting would end at 9 p.m. EST, 8 
p.m. CST and 7 p.m. MST. In the Pacific zone, where daylight-saving time would 
be extended by the bill to encompass presidential Election Day, polls would 
also close at 7 p.m; that extension would occur only in presidential election 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the bill is to get around what many say is the problem of some 
Westerners deciding not to vote after hearing network commentators project 
winners based on results from states where polls have closed. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter James Quillen (R-Tenn.) said it was "unfair . . . that the East Coast 
should announce the results of an election to the West Coast before the polls 
are closed there." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) called the bill "a Rube Goldberg device which 
will louse up the states . . . in order to attack a problem which does not 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes support uniform poll closing in the lower 48 states on 
presidential Election Day.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis and Patty Thomas, owners of this year's Whittier Design House, want 
everyone to know they are not getting a free ride. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomases, who own the house being restored by the Whittier Historical 
Society, have spent about $200,000 -- repairing earthquake damage, some of it 
covered by earthquake insurance. They installed new oak floors, a new 
foundation and redesigned the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
After tours of the home conclude May 21, the furniture decorating the house 
will be sold and the Thomases will be left with the paint and wallpaper on the 
walls, a new kitchen -- and some hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived in a Hotel 
</P>
<P>
"They want it to look good for their functions, then get out," Patty Thomas 
said of the Historical Society. "We want it to be successful for them, but we 
would like a little bit of consideration for what we've been through." 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake damage forced the Thomases and their 6-year-old son out of the home 
in October, 1987. For three months, the family lived at the Whittier Hilton 
while work was completed on a one-bedroom guest house behind their Painter 
Avenue home. Most of their furnishings remain in storage. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomases planned to live in the guest house a few months while basic 
earthquake repairs were completed, then return to the main house. But signing a 
contract to allow their home to become the Design House meant they would stay 
in the guest house until June 9. 
</P>
<P>
The couple admit they underestimated the hardship involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Without a Kitchen 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the Thomases have been without a kitchen, cooking meals 
in a microwave or on a barbecue and washing dishes in the bathroom. (City 
ordinances prohibit kitchens in guest houses.) Play areas for their son were 
restricted by the work crews. Meanwhile, they continued to make mortgage 
payments on the house. 
</P>
<P>
But the last straw came this week, when the Historical Society told the 
Thomases they would have to pay $40 a plate to attend tonight's opening dinner 
on the terrace visible from their guest house living room. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a slap in the face," said Dennis Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Boles, chairwoman of the Design House project, said everyone, even 
Boles herself, is paying to attend the opening night dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of this project is to raise as many funds as we can for the 
Historical Society," Boles said. "We thought we had an understanding with them 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proximity a Factor 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the owners of two other houses restored by the society, the Thomases 
lived on the premises while construction was under way. Boles said the 
proximity added to the tension. "The most advantageous situation for everyone 
would be if the homeowner wasn't here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Boles said she understands the frustration expressed by the Thomases, but added 
that the contract signed by the couple spelled out the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Granted, maybe I haven't put the money into the house that the homeowner has, 
but the homeowner was willing to do this," she said. "What's to be left here 
will be wonderful for them." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Patty Thomas said the family should have moved back into the 
house and tackled earthquake repairs a little at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do this again," she said. "Ever." MARY LOU FULTON

Having conquered stage and film, Pulitizer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet 
is aiming for TV with "Bradford," a series pilot he's written for MTM, which 
has the project in development. The title character, according to a spokesman 
for Mamet, is a NYC detective tired of the urban grind who sets up office in 
the supposedly quiet countryside -- where peace and tranquility doesn't last 
long. 
</P>
<P>
It's Mamet's first network series effort, but not his first for the small 
screen: Last year he wrote and exec-produced the HBO movie "Lip Service," a 
satire on television news. 
</P>
<P>
With his cop show, will Mamet stoop to conquer the boob tube? 
</P>
<P>
" 'Bradford' may sound like a familiar situation," said the spokesman, "but 
David never does anything that's routine." Leonard Klady

Michael Stevenson, a cab driver/printer/clerk, is a near-fanatical advocate of 
veterans' welfare, by his own account. He's been waging a one-man war against 
an East Coast appliance store chain that uses combat footage in its TV spots -- 
in Stevenson's view denigrating soldiers who died in action. So when Ed Glavin, 
an associate producer on "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," called to invite 
Stevenson to appear, he was "thrilled to death." 
</P>
<P>
When show time came, however, Stevenson was surprised to find a lawyer on stage 
attacking his position, and Downey tossing in his own put-downs. Stevenson felt 
humiliated, he told us, and all six of his kids "were very hurt" by his 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But it was after the taping that Stevenson, from Tiverton, R.I., (pop. 13,526), 
really got upset. Backstage, next to a fax machine, he found a copy of a letter 
producer Glavin had sent to the combative lawyer. Under a letterhead bearing 
Downey's trademark Big Mouth, the letter reads, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's guest (on the "Mad as Hell" segment), Michael Stevenson, is an Army 
veteran (actually Navy), who is mad as hell at an advertising firm using real 
war footage to sell VCR's and TV's. 
</P>
<P>
 I want you to interrupt and say who cares, it's no big deal ... the guy is a 
real dimwit ... he shouldn't be too hard to make a fool of.... 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that Stevenson had a copy of the letter, senior producer Peter 
Goldsmith called and apologized. Nonetheless, Stevenson has consulted an 
attorney, claiming that the Downey show "misrepresented" its intentions and 
deliberately set him up. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith (professional pseudonym Zebra Davis) told us that Glavin -- who's no 
longer with the show -- "overstepped his bounds and did a stupid thing. Sure, 
it was a mistake. It was bad for the show, which we don't need." 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith insisted that the Stevenson matter was an isolated incident: "We 
don't have to set people up. That's not the nature of our show." John M. Wilson

MUSIC NEWS: CHALLENGES AT KUSC: REACHING THE YOUNGER LISTENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We see that the classical music (radio) station, as we have known it, is a 
dead art form -- either losing ground or going out of business," says Wallace 
A. Smith, president of USC Radio, the new umbrella title for KUSC-FM and its 
affiliate stations. "This is because the traditional stations have not kept 
current with the newer people who are interested in classical music." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he says, "While we weren't looking, two generations of potential 
listeners have been deprived of music in the public schools, and have grown up 
without that exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Attracting new and younger listeners becomes a first priority, given these 
conditions, Smith believes. He expects his new team of administrators to 
implement that priority. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous challenge, but one we can address by very carefully 
broadening our repertory. By expanding our limits without changing the formats 
our present listeners enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
With the appointment of three members of what he calls "the senior management 
team," Smith takes the first step in what he calls the "reinvention of KUSC for 
the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
In May, Tom Deacon of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. will become vice 
president for programs. Judith Leventhal of WNYC Communications Group will be 
vice president for finance and administration. And William V. Kappelman, 
currently director of engineering and operations at KUSC, will be given vice 
presidential authority for those areas. Under Smith, these three will become 
responsible for planning and implementing "new directions for USC Radio." 
</P>
<P>
At the creation of USC Radio when Smith returned to Los Angeles in August -- he 
had spent 11 months as an administrator at WNYC AM/FM in New York City -- the 
organization began a reassessment of its mission, Smith told The Times last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that in my first tenure here we were preoccupied with cultivating 
partnerships, making KUSC a part of the musical community. That was important 
then. But, what I failed to do, that time around, I want to achieve now: To 
make KUSC a great radio station." 
</P>
<P>
ON THE FESTIVAL PATH: The 13th annual Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, 
S.C., takes place between May 26 and June 11. In 1989, Gian Carlo Menotti's 
late-spring gathering in the historical Southern city offers Bellini's "La 
Straniera" (with Carol Neblett in the title role), "Le Nozze di Figaro," Laurie 
Anderson's "The Electronic Theater," the world premiere of Astor Piazzolla's 
"Tango/Orfeo," the Boston Ballet and the Trisha Brown Company, four jazz 
concerts, daily chamber music events, recitals and visual arts. Write: P.O. Box 
704, Charleston, S.C. 29402. 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere of a work by American composer Stephen Paulus, a mounting of 
Boito's "Mefistofele," and guest appearances by Frederica von Stade, Jeffrey 
Kahane, Garrison Keilor and the male vocal group Chanticleer -- would you 
believe these are offerings at the Oregon Bach Festival in Eugene in 1989? 
Well, believe it. Of course, Helmuth Rilling's much-admired, fortnight-long 
festival also promises Bach, as well as Beethoven, Bartok and Monteverdi. For 
brochure, call: (503) 686-5666. 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, the 41st Aspen Music Festival, June 23-Aug. 20 -- nine weeks of 
daily concerts, master classes and symposia -- offers Rossini's "Moses in 
Egypt," two Britten operas, a sixth annual medical conference on the problems 
of dancers and musicians and a number of special events. For information, write 
Box AA, Aspen, Colo. 81612. 
</P>
<P>
The Catalina Festival of Chamber Music, sponsored by the Da Camera Society of 
Mount St. Mary's College, will present its third edition, June 2-4, in and 
around Avalon. Twelve concerts at seven sites will be given, featuring the Da 
Camera Players (Delores Stevens, music director) and the Angeles String 
Quartet. Those sites include the Airport in the Sky, Casino Theater, the Zane 
Grey Pueblo Hotel, Avalon Community Church, the Inn at Mt. Ada and the Bird 
Park. In addition, three special events mark this weekend: a Friday night 
welcome party at the Casino Ballroom; "Stuart Whitman Reads Zane Grey" at the 
Zane Grey mansion and, back at the Casino Ballroom on Sunday morning, a 
champagne brunch/live radio broadcast by festival director MaryAnn Bonino. 
Information: (213) 746-0450, Ext. 2211.

<P>
BEL CANTO WINNER: A shopping mall usually isn't the site of a formal opera 
competition, except in Santa Monica where, on April 6, Michael Taylor of 
Belmont, along with four other finalists, stood before clusters of shoppers in 
the center court area of Santa Monica Place and won the Bel Canto National 
Operatic Competition. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old baritone, a graduate student at the San Francisco Conservatory, 
sang arias (from "Carmen" and "Pagliacci") to win a six-week scholarship to 
study opera in Siena, Italy, this summer. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bel Canto Foundation, which has been sponsoring opera 
competitions in shopping malls since 1987, claims the idea really isn't that 
odd because opera itself originally began in marketplaces in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
'LOVE' SCREENING: Violinist Arnold Brostoff of the Chicago Symphony will lead a 
live, 21-member orchestra in his recently composed score to the 1927 silent 
film, "Love," which will be shown Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Royce Hall at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran Chicago musician -- he has been a member of the Symphony since 1964 
-- says he was inspired to write the 1 1/2-hour work, in which he will serve as 
his own violin soloist, after he saw Greta Garbo's performance as Anna Karenina 
at a screening of the film two years ago. (This was the first film in which 
Garbo plays Anna Karenina; she made a second in 1934.) 
</P>
<P>
"I was just knocked out," recalls Brostoff. "There's a naturalness about her, 
an emotional look. A femininity." Describing his composition as "eclectic in 
nature" but "not terribly new in sound," Brostoff adds that he included Baroque 
elements in the music because, in his mind, "that's the sound of love." 
</P>
<P>
The Turner Entertainment Co., which owns the rights to "Love," has expressed 
interest in Brostoff's musical score when it shows the Edmund Goulding movie on 
its cable television network, the violinist says.

ON THE RECORD: THE STATELY MARCH TOWARD AUTHENTICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In notes for one of his recordings, the British period-performance specialist 
Roger Norrington asserts that "Beethoven's works are much more like Haydn than 
Wagner, and they ought to sound like it." Simple, incontestable, usually 
unheeded words. 
</P>
<P>
And in their latest Beethoven -- the "Eroica" Symphony (EMI/Angel 49101) and, 
with the excellent fortepianist Melvyn Tan, the First and Second Piano 
Concertos (EMI/Angel 49509) -- conductor Norrington and his London Classical 
Players orchestra convincingly communicate Beethoven's bracing, sharp-edged, 
Haydnesque sound. 
</P>
<P>
More novel at this stage of the game is what Norrington does with later, 
anticipating-Wagner material, Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique" (EMI/Angel 
49541). First, he adheres to the composer's metronome markings, which have, 
simply, been ignored by conductors intent on "interpreting" a work that 
proclaims to be as much about feelings as it is about notes. Fine, to a point. 
</P>
<P>
What so often happens in this interpretive process (which the composer invites) 
is that the inspiration and energy of the original conception are left behind. 
Recapturing and projecting them are the goals of the most serious and astute of 
the present-day antiquarians. 
</P>
<P>
To these jaded ears, Norrington and his orchestra have again done a 
near-miraculous job of restoration, exposing a work of the liveliest wit and 
imagination, quick and original turns of phrase and a ravishingly clear, 
projectile sound -- the product of lighter instrumental weight and crisper 
articulation than that to which 20th-Century performance has accustomed us: 
Berlioz, after his fashion, disclosing his roots in Haydn. 
</P>
<P>
What some listeners may miss here are the giddy tempo and dynamic vacillations, 
the sudden surges found in the usual, more interpreted and darkly moody sort of 
"Symphonie Fantastique," notably in the finale. Well, you don't have to give up 
your Davis, Munch, Bernstein, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Also pushing forward the chronological boundaries of period performance 
repertory is Sir Charles Mackerras, who, for whatever it may be worth, is the 
sole representative among the antiquarians with an established, international 
reputation also as a conductor of modern-instrument forces. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest outing with London's Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, he 
skillfully, even ferociously, trims the fat and restores the sinew to 
Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony and excerpts from the "Midsummer Night's 
Dream" score (Virgin 90725). 
</P>
<P>
Again, if you have never grown tired of this music, if you retain the need to 
hear every new recording to find whether it measures up to the Koussevitsky 
version that introduced you to it, skip Mackerras. If, however, prettiness is 
not Mendelssohn's ultimate attraction, if you'd like to experience some of the 
raucousness emitted by an old oboe or natural horn, give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
In repertory closer to our time -- Dvorak's "Dumky" Trio of 1891 and Smetana's 
1855 Trio in G minor -- the Castle Trio of the Smithsonian Institution reminds 
us (on Smithsonian 034) that gut was the only material used for stringed 
instruments until well into the 20th Century, and that certain performance 
practices we ascribe to the Classical era were in effect until after the First 
World War. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the use and purpose of vibrato and portamento: then, as in 
Haydn's time (if in different degree), as ornaments to be sparingly applied, 
for expressive purposes rather than as a constant, integral and ultimately 
meaningless part of the sound. 
</P>
<P>
In chamber music the "period sound" strikes our ears as being more exotic than 
in larger-ensemble music: the sonic focus is so much narrower and more intense. 
And while the 1890s Steinway piano played here by Lambert Orkis might be taken 
for an exceptionally clear-toned contemporary instrument, the sound and style 
of Marilyn McDonald and Kenneth Slowik, respectively the violinist and cellist, 
could not be mistaken for anything of our time. 
</P>
<P>
The string tone is much more plaintive, edgier, perhaps less centered, 
certainly less lush than what we are accustomed to. And the performances -- by 
all three musicians -- project a clarity and level-headedness that actually 
heightens the powerful dramatic effect of scores that make their emotions felt 
without the tugging and heaving to which they are generally subjected.

PARIS REUNION BAND 
</P>
<P>
Proscenium Entertainment VSH 10004.(Box 909, Hightstown, N.J. 08520) *** 
</P>
<P>
Proscenium has entered the jazz video stakes with a series of sessions recorded 
in West Germany. Despite its title, "Paris Reunion Band" was taped live at the 
Theaterhaus in Stuttgart, with a group of Americans most of whom have worked 
together off and on since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Of the original members heard here, Nathan Davis is a Pittsburgh-based teacher 
and saxophonist; the bassist Jimmy Woode, an Ellington alumnus, has lived for 
many years in Vienna; Woody Shaw is the New York trumpeter, and Walter Bishop, 
a veteran bop pianist, is also New York based. The band's regular pianist, 
Kenny Drew, is represented here as composer of the first number, "Tune Down." 
</P>
<P>
Two recent additions are Nat Adderley on cornet (who plays his own standard 
"Work Song") and Curtis Fuller on trombone, featured in a very busy and 
unfolksy "Old Folks." 
</P>
<P>
The sloppy ensembles suggest a lack of rehearsal (had they just jumped off the 
plane from Paris?); but Shaw's eminently personal horn graces "Sweet Love of 
Mine," and the sax work of Nathan Davis and Joe Henderson counteracts some 
desultory interludes. 
</P>
<P>
OREGON. Proscenium Entertainment VHS 10005. *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's eclecticism is well represented in this live set taped at the 1987 
Freiburg Arts Festival. The musicians' sensitive interplay takes them through a 
series of semiclassical, modal, New Age and Indianesque works, among them the 
familiar "Icarus" with its bass sitar-like drones, and "Leather Cats" with Glen 
Moore. The tabla work by Trilok Gurtu, a percussion expert from Bombay, and 
Paul McCandless on oboe and English horn, stand out in this polyethnic program. 
</P>
<P>
SUPER DRUMMING. Proscenium Entertainment 10003. ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
The participation of Louie Bellson on three of the 10 cuts is the only point of 
interest here, though fellow drummers will no doubt relate well to the 
contributions of Cozy Powell, a rock drummer from England; Gerry Brown, 
reportedly Lionel Richie's favorite drummer; Nippy Noya and Pete York, who 
share the percussion excursions on "Collapso Calypso," and a backup band that 
includes Brian Auger and Gerd Wilden on keyboards. The supposedly grand finale 
in which all six drummers take part is anticlimactic. The notes claim that 
these men constitute a "Who's Who" of jazz and rock drumming -- possibly the 
overstatement of the year. Recorded sound (in a cathedral in Ulm, West Germany) 
is just about adequate. 
</P>
<P>
EGBERTO GISMONTI. Proscenium Entertainment 10006. ****A one-time student of 
Nadia Boulanger, Gismonti here displays his mastery of what he has called 
"Brazilian funk," both on guitar (for the first four numbers, two of which he 
plays unaccompanied on 12-string acoustic guitar) and piano (on the last three 
compositions). Videotaped live in Freiburg, it's a fascinating close-up 
(literally) of his approach to a highly charged music that is often more 
essentially rhythmic than harmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Gismonti is backed on some tunes by six-string guitar, synthesizer and 
percussion. The amazing crisscrossing of rhythms at the piano suggest that if 
Thelonious Monk had been raised in Brazil, and had enjoyed such phenomenal 
technique, this is how he might have sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"COM-PACT, adj.: marked by an arrangement of parts or units closely pressed, 
packed, grounded or knit together with very slight intervals or intervening 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Would that it were so. Make that "no intervening space at all." 
</P>
<P>
Space (on the record shelves) becomes ever more sparse as the endless flood of 
jazz CDs seems less and less compact. 
</P>
<P>
Space (on the printed page) is limited to the point at which the reviewer finds 
himself unable to deal with more than one CD out of 10 (and the occasional LP, 
though these are by now few and far between). 
</P>
<P>
We should be content that so much of jazz history is being re-enacted through 
the CD reissue projects at Fantasy, CBS, RCA and elsewhere, but the process of 
selection is ever more hazardous. If very few items with a rating under three 
stars appear nowadays, it is by no means due to the shortage of mediocre 
albums, but rather because of the need to draw attention to the cream rather 
than the crud. 
</P>
<P>
JUMPIN' IN THE FUTURE. Gunther Schuller. GM 3010 CD (167 Dudley Rd., Newton 
Center, MA 02159) **** 
</P>
<P>
As if his gigantic contribution to the literature of jazz were not enough 
(witness such books as the recently published "Swing Era"), Schuller's ability 
to practice what he preaches is resplendently displayed here. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions came about when George Schuller chanced across a collection of his 
father's old compositions and arrangements, mainly from the 1950s, most of 
which had never been performed in public. It was decided to rehearse them with 
a Boston orchestra by the name of Orange Then Blue, in which the younger 
Schuller plays drums. 
</P>
<P>
The results are startling. If Gunther Schuller is not the most original of 
composers, he is at least (like his role model Gil Evans, to whom these 
performances are dedicated) an arranger of transcendent skill. 
</P>
<P>
Do not be disconcerted by the opening title, "When the Saints Go Marchin' In." 
It is a sort of fantasy-apotheosis based mainly on the first four notes of the 
theme. Closer to the Gil Evans image are "Summertime," "Blue Moon," 
"Anthropology" and "Yesterdays." Of the three Schuller originals, the title 
number is the most astonishing; written in 1947, it was decades ahead of its 
time, with polyphonic textures and exploratory harmony then virtually unused in 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Then Blue is stronger as an ensemble than as a showcase for soloists, 
though the presence of Howard Johnson on bass clarinet in "Night Music" is of 
interest. But first and foremost this is Gunther Schuller's personal triumph. 
</P>
<P>
NO MORE BLUES. Susannah McCorkle. Concord Jazz CCD 4370. **** 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle's switch to Concord should be a helpful career move. Fast-forward past 
the first two tunes (why does she set up such hurdles for herself as 
"Fascinating Rhythm" and "Swing That Music"?); cut three is "The Ballad of 
Pearly Sue," a delightful song by Gerry Mulligan (words and music). Funny and 
feminist, it will bring joy to the heart of Stacy Rowles. Prominent in the 
generally commendable backing are Ken Peplowski on tenor sax and clarinet, Dave 
Frishberg on piano (one tune is his own hilarious "Can't Take You Nowhere") and 
Emily Remler on guitar. McCorkle, whose Portuguese on "No More Blues" sounds 
flawless to these ears, has a penchant for picking out little known verses to 
well known songs, as on "Do Nothing" and "Who Cares?" Perfect on every level -- 
phrasing, timbre, and an ear that can hear grass growing -- McCorkle is the 
best of the entire crop of jazz singers to come to prominence in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
PORTRAITS. Clark Terry. Chesky JD 2 (Box 1268, Radio City Stn., NYC 10101.) *** 
1/2 
</P>
<P>
Backed only by piano, bass and drums, Terry uses a familiar premise (tributes 
to other trumpeters) but never abandons his own style; in fact, Clyde McCoy's 
"Sugar Blues" is truly sublimated. "Autumn Leaves" and "Ciribiribin" on muted 
trumpet and "Sleepy Time Down South" on fluegelhorn are affectionate but still 
non-imitative dedications; "I Can't Get Started" has some of the original Bunny 
Berigan warmth that inspired Terry, but ends less dramatically. Of the two 
vocal cuts, "Finger Filibuster" is another long scatting-the-blues excursion, 
but "Jive at Five" is original and charming. A second horn would have given 
this session a touch of ensemble diversity.

'FREE' LACKS EXPLOSIVE FIREPOWER, HEART; 
</P>
<P>
CONCRETE BLONDE "FREE." I.R.S. 1/2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This L.A. trio's best songs are fragmentation bombs ready to explode -- 
churning emotions and doubts at the center, with a hard, brittle exterior. So 
why doesn't the group's second album leave you picking shrapnel out of your 
ears? Is it just because the production (by the band) is flat? Or because Jim 
Mankey's guitar playing is tame and predictable? Or because Johnette 
Napolitano's emotions are a bit mushy? 
</P>
<P>
In recent concerts, these same songs had heart and explosive firepower. 
Napolitano gave them effectively sharp-edged treatment, with Mankey, drummer 
Harry Rushakoff and new bassist Alan Bloch following suit. But only three 
survive the transition to record. 
</P>
<P>
But those three are superb, delineating the three-cornered Concrete Blonde 
gestalt: randomness of life on the Hollywood streets (the Peter Gunned "God Is 
a Bullet"), living at the bottom but looking up with hope ("Help Me"), and 
remembering and/or looking forward to better times (the guilelessly Beatlesque 
"Happy Birthday"). 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the LP suffers from a combination of arena-rock moves and 
one-dimensional sound. Turning it up helps a bit, but you get the idea that 
though the fuse is lit, the explosion ain't gonna happen. STEVE HOCHMAN

<P>
Mason's in Brentwood has not closed its doors, contrary to rumors and a report 
in the current issue of Los Angeles magazine. Management and administration of 
the restaurant have, however, been taken over by a new company, Hospitality 
Management Services -- an offshoot of Kennard, Herbage &amp; Associates, the 
Santa Ana-based architecture firm that designed the restaurant's interior. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Herbage, a Hospitality Management principal who said he's always felt a 
vested interest in Mason's, named Roger Mathys (formerly of A Fine Affair) as 
chef. Mathys, who has been in the kitchen since March 27, is about to unveil a 
new menu. Meanwhile, the two unrelated Masons who founded the restaurant -- 
former White House deputy protocol chief Morgan Mason (a.k.a. son of the late 
actor James Mason and husband of singer Belinda Carlisle) and entertainment 
attorney John Mason -- remain involved as partners. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE FIRE: Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Feniger of City Restaurant and the 
Border Grill combine a cooking class and book signing for their new (and 
excellent) cookbook, "City Cuisine," on Wednesday evening, April 26, at the 
Epicurean Cooking School in West Hollywood. The class fee is $60 per person, 
and books will be on sale at the school. Information: (213) 659-5990. . . . Le 
Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach feeds local chocolate lust with a "Chocolate 
Weekend" on April 29-30. For $164 per couple, the hotel will offer Saturday 
night accommodations (with 8 p.m. checkout on Sunday), cooking classes, a 
chocolate and champagne reception, and chocolate/champagne gift baskets. Also, 
eleven chefs from around the country will participate in a chocolate sculpting 
contest. . . . Opera in Santa Monica hosts a black-tie benefit dinner for the 
Westside Junior Philharmonic Committee on Sunday, April 30, at 5:30 p.m. 
Appropriately operatic entertainment is included in the $80-per-person ticket 
price. . . . The ordinarily private Regency Club in Westwood opens its doors to 
any and all local wine lovers who have formal garb and $175 per person to spend 
on Tuesday, May 2, for a Bordeaux wine dinner featuring first-growth wines from 
the 1986 vintage. Sponsored by Wally's wine shop in West Los Angeles, the 
evening will include a multicourse repast prepared by Regency Club chef Patrick 
Jamon and discussion of the wines served. Information: (213) 475-0606 or (818) 
505-6454.

BARN DANCE KEEPS URBAN TOES TAPPING; 
</P>
<P>
COWBOYS AND 'MELROSE TRENDY TYPES' SHARE SUDS AND SONGS AT PALOMINO'S WEEKLY 
COUNTRY-WESTERN SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two country music fans were separated by a few tables and a couple of 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner, a rockabilly die-hard, who looked to be all of 18, sported 
arm-length tattoos, a black leather jacket and silver chains; nearby, a 
middle-age cowboy wore a plaid shirt, Western boots and a gold belt buckle. 
</P>
<P>
But the music at the weekly Barn Dance at the Palomino in North Hollywood 
bridged the generation gap. 
</P>
<P>
"To see the kids with the Mohawks and jackets, the Melrose trendy types and the 
cowboys all together, that's what's cool about country and rockabilly music," 
said Ronnie Mack, host of the country and rockabilly show that is broadcast 
every Tuesday on KCSN-FM, the Cal State Northridge radio station. "You can't 
get any broader than that." 
</P>
<P>
Each week about 300 fans squeeze into the club for the free concert, which is 
broadcast from 9 to 11 p.m. After the broadcast, the club sponsors an all-out, 
old-fashioned rockabilly jam session. The stage is open until 1:30 a.m. for 
anyone with an instrument and a passion. Talent is optional. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, a bookkeeper by day and country musician by night, started the show in 
January, 1988, to give exposure to "bands who have knocked their heads against 
the wall for years, playing in bars and small clubs." The bands are not paid, 
but Mack said the show is creating a "country scene" in the San Fernando Valley 
that may pay many dividends later. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the spot to be," said James Intveld, a singer, songwriter and frequent 
performer at the Barn Dance. "It's a hangout. Musicians come here to see and 
hear each other, and see what's going on. Even if people are playing somewhere 
else Tuesdays, they come over afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Intveld, 29, can appreciate the need for exposure. For nearly a decade, he has 
bounced from one bar gig to another. Recently, he sang the jingle on a new 
Oldsmobile commercial. "I've been playing around for many years," he said. "To 
make something happen is very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Most clubs in the Valley offer various forms of rock. The country music scene 
is limited to a hodgepodge of bars and restaurants: the Little Nashville in 
North Hollywood, the Longhorn Saloon in Canoga Park, the Silverado in Van Nuys, 
J.R.'s Cowboy Palace in Chatsworth -- small venues where house bands play much 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in West Los Angeles, country music plays second fiddle to mainstream 
rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe's in Santa Monica offers bluegrass and country periodically but doesn't 
feature it regularly. Last year, the Music Machine presented a country music 
night each Wednesday entitled "Club South of Bakersfield," but gave it up after 
six months when it didn't draw big crowds, Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had had a radio station behind us, like Barn Dance, we might have been 
able to pull something like that off on the Westside," said Deborah Randall, a 
booking agent for the Music Machine. "I don't think there is really a place on 
the Westside to hear country music. We'd like to put more of it back in here." 
</P>
<P>
Mack thinks that the Barn Dance helps fill that void. Over its 13 months, the 
show has featured promising new acts, as well as performers who have achieved 
some success in the world of country music. 
</P>
<P>
Among recent Barn Dance singers: Rose Maddox, a member of the Country Music 
Hall of Fame, who recorded Woody Guthrie's "Philadelphia Lawyer" in the 1950s; 
Big Jay McNeely, who penned the 1957 hit "There Is Something on Your Mind" and 
played at the Grammys two years ago, and Rosie Flores, who in 1987 was 
nominated for top new female vocalist by the Academy of Country Music. 
</P>
<P>
"Barn Dance is perfect for country fans in the Valley," Intveld said. "It's 
centrally located, and people in Hollywood don't mind driving 15 minutes here. 
Plus, a lot of the musicians live around here, where it's cheaper than 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Regular fans like Teri Alexis don't miss a show. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, Alexis, 29, of Mar Vista and her friends occupy the same long, 
rectangular table facing the stage and club entrance. "We can see everybody who 
is coming and going from here," said Jan Stout, 34, a friend from South 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis didn't start as a fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, I didn't even like country music," Alexis said. "I got 
into it through the rockabilly stuff, and then I branched out." 
</P>
<P>
When Alexis first attended Barn Dance, the show was held once every two weeks 
at the Little Nashville. Mack doesn't miss those early days. 
</P>
<P>
"We had musicians who had to sit on the floor to perform, and waitresses would 
sometimes bump into them," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, with KCSN's approval, Mack moved the show to the Palomino, which 
offered a greater seating capacity and a more sophisticated sound system. In 
addition, Mack preferred the Palomino because there is no cover charge for the 
Barn Dance and customers are not required to buy drinks on Tuesday nights. The 
Little Nashville has a two-drink minimum every night. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Thomas, the Palomino's owner, said the show is profitable, even without a 
cover charge and two-drink minimum. And Intveld said the policy makes a big 
difference for musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people stop by for what they think will be five minutes and stay for 
two hours," he said. "If they had to pay a cover, they probably wouldn't have 
come in at all." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Mack was concerned that making Barn Dance a weekly show might make 
it less of an event, but he said the crowds have not diminished since the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Each Barn Dance begins with Mack's own band, which plays traditional country 
music ballads and rockabilly. Among its members is Dale Watson, 26, of Burbank, 
who moved here from Arkansas last year to make a go of it in country music. 
</P>
<P>
Watson is slender and, at first glance, appears frail. Then, out of nowhere, 
comes the deepest voice this side of Texas. "They call him the little man with 
the big voice," Alexis said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Tuesday night, Watson's impassioned voice and storytelling kept the 
crowd in a mellow mood. 
</P>
<P>
After a five-minute break, Larry Dean and the Shooters took over. Playing more 
standard country fare -- including one tune, "A Dirt Road, a Six-Pack and a 
Pickup Truck" -- Dean's group picked up the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues Busters mixed country and blues, and Saints &amp; Sinners played rock 
'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"Are you ready for love?" Danny Tate, lead singer of Saints &amp; Sinners, 
shouted before launching into a set of music that might be more traditionally 
associated with venues such as Club Lingerie, the Roxy or the Country Club. The 
band's guitarist had his shirt open to the last button. 
</P>
<P>
Watson shook his head. "Well, music is music. A lot of this music I can't get 
into, but I respect it." 
</P>
<P>
Mack said he tries to slowly build each evening's energy, culminating in a 
fast-paced rockabilly finale. It is that diversity in tempo and style that 
accounts for the show's appeal to young rockers and middle-aged country fans, 
Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to get one band that can really crank it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Humphrey, KCSN's musical director, said that while "Ronnie and I don't 
always have the same ears," most of the performers fall in the category of 
traditional country and roots music. Humphrey could not estimate how many 
listeners tune in to the show, but he said about 37,000 listen to KCSN in an 
average week. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 11 p.m., when the broadcast of the show had concluded, the jam 
session began and rockabilly reigned. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with that music," said Hugh Scott, 47, whose family has attended 
every Tuesday night concert for the last 13 months. "I used to know all the 
words of every Hank Williams song." 
</P>
<P>
One group after another took the stage. The dance floor, which had been wide 
open most of the evening, filled up. Intveld said, however, that the talent on 
stage doesn't always match the enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"Because other places can't afford to keep a place open for just jamming, 
everybody wants to be here and play, and the talent gets diluted," Intveld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Baltimore, Mack, 34, always wanted to be a music star. Since 
1979, he has played the Los Angeles and Valley clubs regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"I've given up on becoming famous," Mack said. "But maybe these younger bands 
won't have to go through the same thing. Maybe more people will hear them now."

Having been part of the hip hop culture since its inception, I can 
authoritatively suggest that both Robert Hilburn and Dennis Hunt stick to what 
they do best -- writing about aging rock stars and crossover pop artist.

The problem with the white, mainstream rock generation is intolerance toward 
other tastes in music, particularly when that genre happens to be dominated by 
artists who are not white. 
</P>
<P>
It is futile to believe that rap, reggae or any other form that differs in any 
way from the mainstream will not suffer the same fate as disco. The sad fact of 
American life still is intolerance and racism, in the music industry and 
elsewhere.

Rap is an extension of African-American genius. What bothers me is that the 
local black weekly newspapers have failed to give rap the coverage it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
Ice T, Dr. Dre, Malcolm, et al., have yet to receive proper respect for 
cultural achievement. Why should Times writers Hilburn, Hunt, Hochman and 
Marlowe have to author such when the local black weeklies should have been in 
the forefront?

RESTAURANT REVIEW: A LITTLE TASTE OF HEMINGWAY AT CAFE HABANA ON MELROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Sandwich Cubano, that's the thing to order at Cafe Habana. It's muy 
autentico, so they tell me. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you'd feel a little strange going to an ethnic restaurant and ordering 
el sandwich. Think nothing of it. One of the easiest travel experiences you can 
have these days is to fly to a strange land and sit down to a menu in a strange 
alphabet only to find you're reading about something called a club sanweesh. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, el sandwich Cubano is very good. It's ham, roast pork and Swiss cheese 
with lettuce, tomato and pickles, and the best part is that it comes on an 
excellent French-type loaf that's sliced in half lengthwise, making it cute and 
entertaining to eat, if a little hard to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Habana itself is sleek fun. There are the usual expatriate nostalgia 
things on the wall -- maps of Cuba, a framed collection of pre-Castro money -- 
but the place also has some of the Melrose look of post-catastrophe elegance. 
The minimalist chairs are a little tall, so you may have the impression 
everybody walking by your table is oddly short. On a kind of metal cage above 
the kitchen, two clocks ostentatiously show the time on rather hard-to-read 
dials, for those two important time zones, Melrose and Habana. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Exoticism begins with the drinks. You can get beer (mostly American but 
including Caribe), but there are some extremely strange soft drinks. Materba is 
a soda that tastes like various tropical fruits, but is actually flavored with 
the Argentine tea called yerba mate. Malta is a malt-flavored soda that tastes 
sort of like carbonated molasses. Toward the end of the meal, a busboy will 
bring you a glass of ice water with an orange slice in it. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the appetizers are the empanadas, tiny pies with a beef filling 
rather like mild chili. There are also some deep-fried potato balls with beef 
and peppers inside, a tamal Cubano with sweetish cornmeal filled half with 
black beans and half with pork, and delicate, rather European croquettes of ham 
or chicken, lightly fried. They could use a little sauce, but all that's 
available is the tiny pot of a sort of vinaigrette that's always on the table. 
You can get samples of all these on a generous sample plate -- more appetizers 
than one person can be expected to consume alone. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the sandwiches, the entrees tend to be simple fried beef, fish or 
chicken dishes, but some of the meat dishes are more complicated. Complicated 
but basically folksy, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Ropa vieja is just a nice soupy beef and tomato stew with a little pepper in 
it, but boliche is eye of round stuffed with a sausage, stewed until the meat 
is tender (though still a little dry; this is eye of round, after all). The 
sausage gives the meat a complex fragrance, and the whole thing is covered with 
a good tomato sauce that isn't spicy but doesn't taste Italian, either. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some steaks, the Creole sort of steak which makes a cult of how 
thin the meat can be cut, like Wiener schnitzel. The 
</P>
<P>
bistec empanizado, which the menu identifies as the owner's favorite, comes in 
a slightly spicy breading, tasty but sort of a greasy way to have a steak. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the Hemingway. This is surprisingly good: more or less the 
same breaded, paper-thin steak as the bistec empanizado folded over a mixture 
of ham, Swiss cheese and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fish dishes come in a "luscious green sauce" that's not as luscious 
as it sounds, though pretty refined for folksy cooking. It's garlicky and a 
little sweet, and buttery, I guess, but not what I call "luscious." The side 
dishes you can get with entrees include plain black beans, good fried sweet 
plantains, pleasant but rather starchy and not sweet green plantains, and yuca, 
a somewhat neutral-tasting starch. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert there's basically flan and bread pudding. The flan is an eggy model 
with good caramel sauce, and the Spanish bread pudding is exceptionally good. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes there are also cheesecakes with sauces for dessert, but they tend to 
be pretty strange. And the cheesecakes have a curious aroma, "like barbecue 
sauce," somebody said. 
</P>
<P>
I choose to believe this cannot be muy autentico Cuban cheesecake. I'll have 
another sandwich, please. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: empanadas, $3.35; el sandwich Cubano, $4.95; boliche, $8.95; 
Spanish bread pudding, $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Habana, 7465 Melrose, West Hollywood. (213) 655-2822. Open 11 a.m. to 11 
p.m. Sunday through Thursday, till 11:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Beer and

Sullivan gives Shakespeare in L.A. Theater a "D" but mentions ony the Taper, 
Old Globe, Ahmanson and L.A.T.C. Has he seen the Bard's work at any waiver 
theaters recently? 
</P>
<P>
With talented and versatile actors working in our theaters -- albeit on the 
small-theater level -- we don't need a Brit to show us how to do Shakespeare. 
What we do need is a critic who grades the work of all the students, not just 
the big kids in the class!

RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's tell it like it is when it comes to rap "music." First of all, it's not 
music. It is usually missing two of the three requisite elements of music -- 
melody, harmony and rhythm. As any neighbor of a rap fan knows (from the 
vibrations through the wall), the stuff has plenty of rhythm. But melody? I 
guess that would be too un-macho (and take too much work). And harmonies are 
rudimentary at best, droning at worst. 
</P>
<P>
This stuff is tribal chanting. It's the passing on of folk lore with a rhythmic 
accompaniment. To call this "music" is a slap at hard-working musicians 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It is the real musicians, the ones who study, hone and perfect their art, that 
the Times should be covering. These street thugs, who, by their own admission, 
used the gains from thievery and drug sales to launch their careers by buying a 
record company, would be deserving of contempt if their stories hadn't been 
sugar-coated by Robert Hilburn's April 2 article, "Rap." 
</P>
<P>
If the article had been titled "Gangsters buy record company to distribute 
X-rated stories," would it have made the front page of the Sunday Calendar 
section?

TRAVELING -- AND UNRAVELING THE MYSTERIES OF JEWISHNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As befits a founding member of A Traveling Jewish Theatre, Naomi Newman is once 
again on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we were called The Stay-at-Home Jewish Theatre, there's no one else 
doing our work," said the actress-writer, whose solo piece, "Snake Talk: Urgent 
Messages from the Mother" is playing through May 14 at the Tiffany Theatre in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Traveling is an essential part of our economic survival. But I also think it's 
what we're meant to be doing. And it's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
In the piece, Newman -- with the help of some quick-change costuming, lighting 
and vocal adjustments -- plays three very different women. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Elsa is the "prophetic voice," she says. Rivke is the "cosmic yenta, the 
archetypal Jewish mother . . . representing the hard-earned wisdom of the oral 
tradition; she teaches you how to be a mensch -- a full human being." And the 
garrulous Hag, the actress says, "speaks the truths nobody wants to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Assembled from bits of improvisational work with collaborator-director Martha 
Boesing, Newman feels that the piece represents an opportune union of art and 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think art is ever planned. It comes from some unknown place; what you 
do is make room for it, open the door to it. When I say to my friends, 'Isn't 
this weird: Here I am, 58 years old, on the road -- I should've done this 20 
years ago,' they say, 'You couldn't have. You didn't have the life experience.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's true. 'Snake Talk' really is about my life: my Jewishness, my feminism, 
my Buddhist practice, my work with cancer patients, raising my kids. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Her original life goal, Newman noted, was to sing. "My parents were not 
religious," she said, recalling her childhood in Detroit. "They were what we 
used to call linkers: leftists, politically radical. And Yiddishists -- for 
them, the sense of Jewish identity was cultural. When I was growing up, we 
never went to temple. We had Seders, but my father wrote his own Haggada, and 
it was very political. My sister would play the piano, and I'd sing Yiddish 
songs." 
</P>
<P>
After a move to Los Angeles in the '40s, Newman began studying classically and 
earned a degree in music from UCLA. Later, as a young mother (she now has two 
grown daughters), she began taking acting lessons, with Jeff Corey. From that 
came a 1968 introduction to "improv guru" Del Close -- which led to work with 
the Committee Workshop and the Synergy Trust. A divorce necessitated a larger 
income, so Newman went back to school, became a practicing therapist and worked 
at the Center for the Healing Arts in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays we'd call that a workaholic," she said wryly. Her next husband (the 
actress is recently divorced from No. 3) wanted her to cut back, so she eased 
up on the social work. But not the theater. In 1978, she, Corey Fisher and 
Albert Greenberg founded A Traveling Jewish Theatre; four years ago, the 
collective relocated to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes its a gypsy life," she admitted. "Two years ago, I was six months on 
the road. Then I had a quiet year. Now I'm here for two months, then to 
Switzerland, then back for the American Festival at Cornell, then to Minnesota, 
maybe New York. The funny thing is, I'm such a homing pigeon. Once I get on the 
road it's fine -- but every time I have to leave, it's torture. When I'm home, 
I hardly leave the house. When I go to the market, I can't wait to get back 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Newman sees "Snake Talk" as "very much a Jewish show." She nodded. "But it's as 
much a woman's show, a political show and a spiritual show. It comes from 
women, but it's for women and men. In Berkeley, we had women coming out from 
every group: the radically political, lesbians, conservative Jewish, liberal 
Jewish, theologians. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense of cultural identification is that it's a bridging process, not a 
cutting-off process," she said matter-of-factly. "So even though it's a Jewish 
show, it's something anyone could relate to. We've played Stockholm, Denmark, 
Hamburg -- and there ain't a lot of Jews there. The difference has less to do 
with where we are than the people: There are responsive audiences and 
non-responsive audiences." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most difficult ones, Newman noted, are often Jewish. "If the people 
coming are Jews interested in being Jewish, culturally and spiritually, and 
also open to new theater forms -- that's good. But if they're very 
conservative, and they come expecting old-fashioned Yiddish theater or 'Fiddler 
on the Roof' or Molly Picon, they're going to be very disappointed."

In a boost to the Seabrook nuclear power plant, a federal bankruptcy judge in 
Manchester, N.H., refused to block low-power testing of the reactor and 
approved a settlement that ensures funding until the end of the year. "It is 
likely that Seabrook is ultimately going to go into commercial operation," said 
Judge James Yacos in a reorganization hearing of the Public Service Co. of New 
Hampshire, Seabrook's lead owner. Judge Yacos approved an agreement reached 
Thursday by state officials, Public Service and its creditors ensuring that New 
Hampshire ratepayers will not be charged for cleaning up Seabrook if it 
conducts the atomic tests but does not operate commercially. Before the 
agreement was reached, state officials had asked Yacos to delay the tests until 
commercial operation is assured.

Students at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and Wayne State 
University in Detroit continued sit-ins. UNM President Gerald May, whose outer 
office has been held since Tuesday, said regents would soon reconsider a 
$50-a-semester tuition hike to $686. About 40 protesters said they would 
continue the sit-in but promised to tidy May's office, which has become 
cluttered during the protest. In Detroit, about 70 black students who have 
occupied the Wayne State student center since Wednesday said they will discuss 
with administrators Monday demands for stepped-up minority student and faculty 
recruitment and a requirement that each instructor teach an African-related 
course.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rachel Thompson had never tasted shrimp in her native Louisiana, and Ronnie 
Emonet had never heard the wind moan through the pines in the hill country of 
his home state. 
</P>
<P>
The two 16-year-olds represent the best hope for dismantling a wall of mistrust 
built generations ago between two cultures, said Carole Andrepont of Opelousas, 
who turned what started as a joke into a social experiment that worked. 
</P>
<P>
Andrepont, a member of the Louisiana Tourism Board active in international 
youth exchange programs, jokingly told a friend one day: "If you want to have a 
real cultural exchange, have folks from north Louisiana come to south 
Louisiana. It's like two different countries." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Cup of Life 
</P>
<P>
An almost visible line across the center of Louisiana separates the staid 
upstate Protestants from the Catholic Cajuns, who make time for work around a 
busy schedule of enjoying the full cup of life. 
</P>
<P>
The Cajuns, descendants of French exiles from Nova Scotia, make up a third of 
the state's population. Those of different ancestry who also live in south 
Louisiana have adopted the laid-back Cajun life style. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, the first French-speaking Catholic elected to the 
state's highest office this century, says the division is more perception than 
anything else, but that "perception can be real." 
</P>
<P>
"The barrier exists in the minds of those who have not had the opportunity to 
visit one end of the state or the other," he said, "but invariably, when they 
do, they come away with an amazement of how much in common they have." 
</P>
<P>
"The barrier is exaggerated but it's there," added Gov. Buddy Roemer, whose 
family plantation is not far from the Arkansas border in north Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"A real factor has been a lack of quality transportation. It's hard to get from 
upstate Shreveport to New Orleans. In fact, it's easier to get from Shreveport 
to Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and Roemer agree that an exchange program for Louisiana youths could 
eventually close the perceived culture gap. 
</P>
<P>
The idea gnawed at Andrepont, and she mentioned it to Linda Graham, her Ruston 
counterpart, at a tourism meeting in Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I had an idea about two cities having an exchange program, and the 
more we looked at it, the more we liked it," she said. "We talked to our 
mayors, school officials and civic leaders. Now, we've done it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Swap Hometowns 
</P>
<P>
In a recently ended two-week program, about 20 Ruston high school students 
spent a week in Opelousas and an equal number of the south Louisiana students 
stayed in Ruston. 
</P>
<P>
The students stayed in the homes of host families who treated them like their 
own kids, Andrepont said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors and civic leaders also visited each other's cities. Like the kids, 
they discovered that people everywhere are just folks and develop different 
views, depending on personalities and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are more free, more open down here," said Rachel, who attends 
Ruston High School. "Up north we're very polite, but down here. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I called my mom and said I was staying here another two weeks. She just

<P>
"I like Ruston better than here," said Telameckus Anderson, a junior at 
Opelousas High School. "They're so nice. The hills are beautiful!" 
</P>
<P>
"The family I stayed with made me feel like we were related," said Emonet, a 
junior at Opelousas Catholic High. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Language Barrier 
</P>
<P>
Of the response to his Cajun accent, Emonet said: "The girls thought it was 
cute. I laughed at their drawls. We laughed with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Graham said she learned something important from her visit to southern 
Louisiana: 
</P>
<P>
"I need to go home and loosen up a bit. We're more conservative in Ruston, and 
we are organized. I find myself regimented to the point where I get a little 
bit irritated when everything doesn't go just like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to relax. I need to come down here about once a month." 
</P>
<P>
Andrepont, meanwhile, said that Cajuns can learn from other life styles, and 
perhaps find a middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we do is almost overdone," she said. "When we eat, it's a lot, and 
the best. If it's seasoned, it's highly seasoned. People who drink -- they 
drink!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Exchange Planned 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Andrepont said the two cities plan to make the exchange program an 
annual event, and to encourage other communities to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to be a state program," Andrepont said. "We've got 
Church Point interested in finding a north Louisiana city for an exchange 
program. The governor is interested. We need to end the division in this state. 
The 40 youngsters in this program don't have the old attitude anymore. It 
works." 
</P>
<P>
Roemer, the governor, said: "This is the first of several such programs that 
will happen over the next year. One of the issues in my campaign was the need 
for all of the state to pull together."

A federal judge in Miami denied motions by Eastern Airlines unions to dismiss a 
$1.5-billion suit filed before the current strike began on March 4 and accusing 
the unions of racketeering, extortion and fraud, a spokesman for the airline 
said. Robin Matell said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told lawyers on 
both sides that he had rejected the unions' contention that the suit was 
without merit and should be dismissed. A spokesman for the striking 
International Assn. of Machinists said the union had not confirmed the report 
and had no comment on it. Spokesmen for the pilots and flight attendants unions 
were unavailable. Meanwhile, the strike by the machinists entered its sixth 
week while pilots and flight attendants continued to honor the picket lines. 
Eastern has been virtually grounded by the walkout. The airline has since filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.

NEWSMAKERS: DID JACKIE CALL MARILYN'S BLUFF?

 -- A new book about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis says she once told Marilyn 
Monroe that she would divorce President John F. Kennedy if Monroe would marry 
him and move into the White House. C. David Heymann, author of the unauthorized 
biography, "A Woman Named Jackie," said he got files from the Secret Service, 
FBI and CIA under the Freedom of Information Act, obtained the former First 
Lady's social files and interviewed 825 individuals. Onassis had no comment on 
the book's content, her spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman, said. Actor Peter 
Lawford, Kennedy's late brother-in-law, is quoted in an excerpt as saying that 
Jacqueline Kennedy offered to step aside when the actress called her, but also 
said that "if Marilyn wasn't prepared to live openly in the White House, she 
might as well forget about it." Among other stories in the book, to be 
excerpted in a supermarket tabloid and elsewhere, is one from Kennedy legal 
consultant Langdon Marvin Jr. -- also now deceased, a publisher's spokeswoman 
said -- about President Kennedy sneaking away from his Secret Service guards 
for a sexual liaison without taking the codes he would need for retaliation in 
the event of a nuclear attack. The book also says Kennedy had illicit sexual 
encounters on the night of his inauguration and before the debates with Richard 
M. Nixon.

 -- A daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and a son of Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., who say the death penalty would not bring back their fathers, helped start 
a campaign against capital punishment at the Center for Nonviolent Social 
Change in Atlanta. M. Kerry Kennedy said some killers should be imprisoned 
forever, but that executions "won't bring back my father; they'll only take 
someone else's father." Martin Luther King III said: "If we believed in an eye 
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, most of us would be without eyes and 
without teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Every father wants his son to achieve things he never did. So it was a 
proud Evel Knievel who watched his son, Robbie, soar over the fountains at 
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, completing a motorcycle stunt that nearly killed 
the elder Knievel. "That was for you, Dad. I love you," Robbie told his father, 
who ran to hug him after the jump. "I'm not the greatest daredevil in the 
world, I'm the father of the greatest daredevil in the world," Evel said. About 
20,000 people watched the younger man's perfect 180-foot flight, among them a 
brain surgeon and paramedics who stood by in case accidents ran in the family. 
Evel was in a coma for 30 days after he tried the jump and missed in 1967. DAVE

Charges that police in East Palo Alto took money and drugs from suspects they 
arrested illegally are being investigated by the FBI. The probe was begun in 
mid-February at the request of San Mateo County authorities, according to U.S. 
Atty. Joseph Russoniello. He declined to say how many officers are being 
investigated. "What we're concerned about is an atmosphere where police think 
their conduct will be approved tacitly, if not openly, because the targets are 
so reprehensible," Russoniello said. "Allowing that to develop just undermines 
the entire administration of justice.

Students plastered Beijing campus bulletin boards with posters mourning the 
death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang and calling for more democracy 
in China. Hu, 73, died after suffering two heart attacks within a week. The 
posters described Hu, bundled into political obscurity after pushing the 
country too far and too fast into reforms, as a heroic "fighter for democracy" 
and indirectly attacked the Beijing leadership. Hu allowed a cultural thaw and 
openly questioned Marxism before being forced to resign in early 1987. 
Conservatives had accused him of failing to stop the spread of "bourgeois 
liberal" ideas blamed for the student unrest of late 1986 which erupted at 
Beijing University and other colleges.

The Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet Union's new parliamentary body, 
will go into session for the first time May 25, the Tass news agency said. The 
date was announced in a decree of the Supreme Soviet that was signed by 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The congress must meet within two months of 
being elected. Nationwide multi-candidate balloting for 1,500 seats in the 
congress was held March 26, and runoff elections were conducted April 9. But 
199 of those seats remain unfilled. In those undecided districts, only one or 
two candidates ran March 26, but voters refused to give any of them a majority. 
New elections are being organized and balloting will take place in those 
districts May 14.

The Israeli army extended curfews to much of the occupied lands to prevent 
violence on the anniversary of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir's assassination. 
Soldiers reportedly shot and killed one Palestinian. Throughout the 
territories, residents observed a general strike to protest the killings of at 
least five Palestinians last week. Wazir, the military commander of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, was gunned down in Tunis, Tunisia, on April 
16, 1988, by suspected Israeli commandos. Underground leaders of the 
16-month-old Palestinian uprising have called for a "day of mass rage" to mark 
today's anniversary of his death.

Ahmed Jabril, leader of a group suspected of bombing Pan Am Flight 103, denied 
in an interview with ABC News that his organization had any role in the attack 
that killed 270 people in December. But Jabril acknowledged that his group 
routinely used the same kind of bomb investigators say was used to blow up the 
jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. Jabril said a confederate, Hafez Dalkamoni, 
commonly built and used the type of device, a bomb-rigged radio-cassette 
recorder, that downed the Pan Am jet. Dalkamoni is in a West German jail after 
a police raid last October that netted three devices like the one used to blow 
up Flight 103. Jabril heads the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine-General Command.

ROAD DEATHS DOWN IN 1988

Traffic fatalities in 1988 dropped to their lowest rate ever recorded in 
California, with 119 fewer deaths than in 1987, the Highway Patrol said. The 
CHP said 5,381 people died last year on California roadways, a 2.2% decrease 
from the 5,500 traffic deaths in 1987. The death rate dropped to 2.3 traffic 
fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled by California motorists, 
compared to the 2.4 rate that has held steady since 1985. CHP spokesman Sam 
Haynes said the 1988 rate is the lowest ever recorded by the agency, which was 
created in 1929 and has been monitoring traffic deaths at least since the 
1940s. "We believe the major factor is an increased use of seat belts," Haynes 
said. "The seat belt use rate is up to 65% on freeways and 50% on surface 
streets."

QUESTION OF A POSSIBLE 'FIFTH FORCE' BAFFLES SCIENTISTS

<P>
Like storied thinkers and ascetics through the ages, physics professor Paul 
Boynton sometimes goes to a cave to ponder some of life's biggest questions. 
</P>
<P>
The cave -- really an abandoned mine shaft in the Cascade Range -- is Boynton's 
laboratory for studying a question that has baffled physicists for at least two 
decades: 
</P>
<P>
Is there a fifth physical force, a different kind of gravity, that could better 
explain observable events in the universe? 
</P>
<P>
Current scientific wisdom holds that there are four forces of nature: 
electromagnetism; the "strong force" that holds atomic nuclear material intact; 
the "weak force" responsible for nuclear decay; and gravity, which keeps 
everything on Earth in place and the stars tethered in their galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ring Suspended in Cave 
</P>
<P>
In the mouth of the mine shaft, the physicist has suspended a special ring -- 
half copper, half polyethylene -- to test whether a different kind of physical 
force may be detected between the ring and the immense mass of granite in the 
cliff side. 
</P>
<P>
Normal gravitational force that makes one body attract another is certainly 
there. But might there be another force working against gravity? Or, perhaps, 
one that adds to it? 
</P>
<P>
The ring in the cave and dozens of other experiments being conducted by 
scientists around the globe are shots in the dark in the quest for the fifth 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Eminent thinkers freely admit that they are not sure what they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Although the existence of a fifth force was posited early this century, the 
modern hunt for it began in earnest when Australian physicist Frank Stacy took 
gravitational measurements in mile-deep mines of central Australia. Stacy 
reported differences in the gravitational pull that were not predicted by 
standard theory. His conclusions, however, and others since were found to be in 
error because they were based on an imperfect model of the Earth's 
gravitational pull. 
</P>
<P>
The hunt goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploring," says Eric Attleburger, another University of Washington 
physicist using a different means of searching "for whatever it is." 
</P>
<P>
Attleburger, who performs most of his experiments on the University of 
Washington campus, uses tiny disks of copper, beryllium and aluminum suspended 
by metal filaments to determine whether the disks are attracted by a nearby 
mound of lead. 
</P>
<P>
Precise instruments are trained on the disks to measure whether oscillations 
occur that could indicate the presence of a fifth force. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, there is no sign of anything out of the ordinary," Attleburger said. 
But he adds: "Essentially, everybody in physics thinks that there has to be 
more to it." 
</P>
<P>
This quest appears to stem largely from a scientific hunch that something is 
missing in our knowledge about the four known universal forces. 
</P>
<P>
The vague but nagging feeling is that although the four forces do a good job of 
explaining physical events, they lack coherence. They do not, as Attleburger 
says, "make up a pretty package." 
</P>
<P>
The relationships among three of the forces -- the strong, the weak and 
electromagnetism -- are at least partially understood and tied together neatly 
under a unifying theory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Approach 
</P>
<P>
"Gravity is still out there all by itself," says Jim Thomas, a physicist doing 
fifth-force experiments at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas takes a different tack from Attleburger and Boynton in his experiments. 
He measures gravitational force over a wide area and then measures whether the 
force changes in relation to the distance one climbs up a high tower. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' experiments are "range dependent." Boynton's and Attleburger's are 
"composition dependent." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus of the three experimenters, as well as thinkers who attended a 
recent conference in the French Alps on "fifth force" work, is that there is no 
clear evidence that another force exists. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas states that he is not even looking for a force apart from gravity, but 
rather a modification of gravity that may depend on distance from an attracting 
object. 
</P>
<P>
Boynton, working at the mouth of the old mining tunnel near Index, Wash., 
observed during experiments two years ago what he believed were small 
differences in the attractive force between the massive granite cliff and 
various materials used in his suspended rings. 
</P>
<P>
But he concluded that the statistical differences recorded were "too close" to 
the degree of possible error in his measuring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The differences measured were only three times bigger than the (margin of) 
error," he said. "This time we're trying it with better equipment that is more 
accurate. If there is any force there, attractive or repulsive, it's small." 
</P>
<P>
Several well-known scientists and theoreticians have postulated the existence 
of a yet-undiscovered force -- most dealing with either attraction or repulsion 
between bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of reasons for speculating," says Attleburger. "But the 
question is that you've got to look and see. It's really exploring. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there is a layer of nature we've been ignorant of for all these years. 
It would terribly exciting if there were."

IT'S A TREE STUMP, OPTICAL ILLUSION -- OR ARGENTINE COUSIN OF THE LOCH NESS 
MONSTER

<P>
Scotland's legendary Loch Ness monster may have a cousin in Argentina, if 
reports of sightings of a strange lake creature are to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and tourists at the Andes winter sport resort of Bariloche are 
convinced there is a Nessie-like beast living in the deep blue waters of Nahuel 
Huapi Lake at the foot of the Patagonian mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The monster has been nicknamed Nahuelito, a diminutive of the lake's name, 
chosen the way the Scots arrived at Nessie for their phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine version reportedly has been seen for several minutes at a time, 
bobbing along the surface of the 318-square-mile mountain lake. 
</P>
<P>
It has been described as a sort of giant water snake complete with humps and 
fish-like fins. Others say it looks like a swan with a snake's head, or like 
the hull of an overturned boat or the stump of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of its length vary from 15 feet to 150 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Many people are convinced that this could be the world's last remaining 
dinosaur. A spate of sightings were reported early in February, by visitors to 
resorts in mountainous southern Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Coming as it did toward the end of summer vacation, the monster story seemed 
made to order for that time of year journalists everywhere call "silly season," 
when real news is hard to come by. As a result, Nahuelito has been hogging the 
front pages here. 
</P>
<P>
Television news programs repeatedly have shown the first "film recordings" of 
the monster. Yet apart from a few unclear lines on the calm surface of the 
lake, the films confirm very little. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation as to the age of the monster. In the centuries-old 
history of Patagonia's native Indians, there is mention of an awesome creature 
that had no head, legs or tail. 
</P>
<P>
Bariloche, one of the country's best-loved vacation spots, has absolutely 
nothing against Nahuelito. In fact, the townspeople have taken to the idea of 
having a monster in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, tourist officials have seen the commercial possibilities 
behind the "discovery." Friendly-looking Nahuelitos can already be seen smiling 
from advertising posters and on T-shirts around the resort, which draws more 
than 100,000 guests in winter as well as summer seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Self-styled monster experts have emerged to deliver their considered opinions 
on the habits of the creature. Apparently it is rather moody and only surfaces 
in the summer when the wind is still. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say a sudden swell of water and a shooting spray signal that the 
creature is coming to the lake's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone wishing to find out more from the locals about their unusual visitor 
soon finds himself in a confusing whirl of half-truths, myths and ghost 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
The dinosaur theory is a favorite, but suspicion that a secret, submarine-type 
vessel may be patrolling the deep is running a close second. 
</P>
<P>
Also going the rounds is speculation that the thing could be a result of 
nuclear experiments carried out by German scientists when Gen. Juan Peron was 
in power in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The few researchers who have seriously looked at the phenomenon have given 
Argentina's Nessie the thumbs-down. 
</P>
<P>
They say the Nahuel Huapi "sightings" are probably optical illusions, perhaps 
caused by some physical disturbance of the lake's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this has done nothing to dispel the monster myth. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave the creature in peace, don't use it for profit and don't hunt it down 
and put it in a museum," advised Luis Gazen, one of the many tourists who claim 
to have spotted the beast.

ZANZIBAR ACTS TO GENTRIFY SITE OF ONCE-LAVISH HOMES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a century after Arab slave traders and gold and ivory merchants built 
their lavish homes, shops and bazaars near Zanzibar's flourishing harbor, the 
labyrinthine old quarter is crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the government is trying to restore the district known as Stone Town to at 
least a semblance of its former glory through a process very similar to the 
gentrification of run-down neighborhoods in England and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial Focal Point 
</P>
<P>
Stone Town never ceased to be a commercial focal point for the Spice Island. 
Its elaborately carved, brass-studded wooden doors and the lattice-work 
balconies hanging over narrow alleys embody Zanzibar's intertwined Arab, Asian 
and African heritage. 
</P>
<P>
During 20 years of social and economic upheaval, Stone Town was neglected and 
suffered severe deterioration. But with new money created by the government's 
5-year-old policy of economic liberalization and $400,000 in technical 
assistance from the United Nations, Zanzibar hopes to reverse the decay. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is led by Ahmed Sheik Ahmed, director of the Stone Town Conservation 
and Development Authority, which has put most of its resources not into 
renovating the buildings but selling them. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of selling the buildings is not to get money, the idea is to get 
people to look after the buildings," said Ahmed. 
</P>
<P>
After a revolution by Zanzibar's black majority in 1964, many of their 
abandoned buildings were confiscated by the socialist government, which 
converted them into multifamily dwellings for low-income families and newly 
arrived rural peasants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Danger Seen 
</P>
<P>
Many of the dilapidated structures now pose a potential danger to tenants and 
shoppers in the quarter's busy alleys, said Ahmed. During heavy rains in 1984, 
seven buildings collapsed, killing five people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stone Town is home to an estimated 18,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
It is Zanzibar's historic seat of government and still houses most of the 
island's official offices, 40% of the city's classrooms, the majority of its 
mosques, temples and churches, as well as banks, movie houses, hotels, 
restaurants and the island's main market. 
</P>
<P>
It contains the remains of a stone fort built by Omani Arabs in the 1700s, a 
palace built by the island's Arab rulers in the middle 19th Century, the home 
of Tippu Tub, a notorious slave trader, and other historically or 
architecturally valuable buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the development authority has overseen the sale of 120 buildings, 
and Ahmed credited the sales to the nation's economic liberalization policies 
that opened doors to free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Before 1984, most shops were closed. After 1984, most shops opened. Now they 
can do business, make money and repair buildings," Ahmed said.

'FLORIDA SYNDROME' HAUNTS NEWCOMERS LOOKING FOR EDEN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In travel brochures and the songs of Jimmy ("Margaritaville") Buffett, Florida 
is a palm-fringed haven from the rat race where ordinary troubles dissolve 
under a blazing sun. 
</P>
<P>
But many newcomers are still hunting for paradise among the impersonal sprawl 
of shopping plazas and traffic-clogged thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here with stars in my eyes," says Francis Greene, a 28-year-old 
construction equipment salesman who relocated from Philadelphia in September. 
"I ended up with an ulcer in my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
In a state of "transplants" -- 780 a day by census estimates -- Greene is one 
of the many rejections, say psychological experts and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, more attention is being paid to the malaise that can beset Florida 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say working families are confronted by demoralizing commutes, 
uninviting condominium complexes and the anxiety of random violence in a state 
where cash-and-carry gun purchases are still possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Isolation, Boredom 
</P>
<P>
Retirees, they say, can face isolation and boredom. Others simply drop out. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it the Florida Syndrome," says Dr. Dean J. Rotondo, director of the 
neurological laboratory at Fair Oaks Hospital in Delray Beach, about 45 miles 
north of Miami. "It's the reality of Florida versus the fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
Rotondo believes the funk is particularly strong in the 60-mile urban strip 
between Miami and West Palm Beach, where a nearly twofold population boom in 
the last 20 years has overburdened roads and sent developers to the fringe of 
the Everglades in search of land. 
</P>
<P>
Stress-related ailments, such as depression and chronic anxiety, are the most 
common manifestations of Florida Syndrome, says Rotondo, a native of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"I, like many people, came here thinking that if I had a problem, I would just 
go to the beach," he says. "Well, you can only go to the beach so much. When 
people come down here and find all the problems they left behind -- and 
sometimes they are worse -- what's left is a lot of disillusionment and 
irritability." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stress Amplified 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joyce Glasser, a psychological counselor in Ft. Lauderdale, says the normal 
stress of moving is sometimes amplified in Florida because relatives and 
friends are often left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always an adjustment process after a move," says Glasser, who came 
from Chicago in 1977. "What we have here are people facing all these new ways 
of doing things. It hits some people quite hard." 
</P>
<P>
In Dr. Cesar Benarroche's counseling sessions, some newcomers fret over a lack 
of convenient public transportation and the crime reports of a homicide every 
6.4 hours. Some are even haunted by the peninsula's flatness and air 
conditioners blasting on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to deal with Florida as it is, not like you imagine it should be," 
says Benarroche, a former Yale University professor. 
</P>
<P>
But accepting the urbanized Florida is particularly difficult for the elderly, 
who may have toiled during their careers with visions of an idyllic retirement 
in the sun, says Irwin I. Isaacs, a Ft. Lauderdale psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aura of Death 
</P>
<P>
Domestic friction and the aura of death greet many retires, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"You have these large retirement villages, and each week there's someone 
dying," says Isaacs, who conducts seminars for disenchanted elders in South 
Florida. "You just make a new friend and then they are dead. It can be very 
disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs, who moved to Florida from suburban Nassau County near New York City, 
says many retirees in his groups often can't cope with the full-time presence 
of a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the person you dreamed of spending your life with, and all of a sudden 
you say: 'I think I hate them,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some who find that the warm breezes sweep them right off the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Al Ackerman, 32, came to Miami from Chicago in 1984 seeking to make a stake in 
the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
He now does odd jobs in the Keys and occasionally hops a sailboat to the nearby 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
"The only Florida Syndrome I ever had was a hangover from too much rum," he 
said one recent afternoon in Key Largo. 
</P>
<P>
He then started to hum a Jimmy Buffett tune.

DEVELOPER USED WRONG ZONING MAP; 
</P>
<P>
TALL ORDER -- TRIM BUILDING 12 STORIES

<P>
How do you erect a 19-story building in New York City? 
</P>
<P>
Start with a 31-story structure. Discover that zoning prohibits a building that 
tall. Lose a three-year court fight. And receive an order to lop off 12 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to 108 East 96th St., the $7.2-million high-rise set to shrink this 
month in the final act of a showdown between local activists and its developer, 
Parkview Associates. David defeated Goliath recently when the city ruled that 
the 31-story edifice must lose its top dozen floors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces $10-Million Loss 
</P>
<P>
The decision will cost the developer about $10 million, leaving the building 
owners a little queasy as they ponder continuing their fight to save those 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take a while to digest this decision," Jay A. Segal, attorney 
for Parkview Associates, said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has dealt with a second Manhattan building found to be 
too tall. The 811-foot CitySpire project on West 54th Street is 14 feet higher 
than allowed by zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
But officials spared the building a steel haircut. Developer Ian Bruce Eichner 
reached a compromise agreement in which he will build a $2.5-million dance 
studio in return for a variance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Structure Unoccupied 
</P>
<P>
Parkview's $10-million loss includes the cost of chopping off the illegal 
floors, the income from the lost apartments and the cost of the building's 
extended vacancy. The structure remains unoccupied; it was to have opened in 
late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The odds do not look good for Parkview, which has unsuccessfully taken its 
fight to preserve the high-rise to the city, a local court, a state court and 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The city rejected a Parkview proposal to build about 40 low-income apartments 
for the elderly in East Harlem in return for a zoning variance leaving the 
building intact. 
</P>
<P>
Parkview has until April 27 to appeal its most recent defeat; the developer's 
last option is a lawsuit against the city charging that the too-tall ruling was 
arbitrary and capricious, Segal said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Parkview decide not to appeal, the demolition will begin shortly after 
that date, city Buildings Department spokesman Vahe Tiryakian said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have 30 Days to Appeal 
</P>
<P>
"They have 30 days to appeal, and we're obliged to give 'em that," Tiryakian 
said. "We'll have to wait and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
While the developers worry about the cost of destroying 12 floors, many 
residents of the well-to-do area could not be happier about the unanimous 
decision by the city Board of Standards and Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really very, very pleased. We feel that, after this almost three-year 
battle, this was the right result," said Genie Rice, president of the local 
community group Civitas. 
</P>
<P>
It was Rice who first noticed that the 31-story building violated a 1973 
regulation putting a 19-floor limit on the area's skyline. Developer Albert 
Ginsburg, in getting a permit for the structure, used an incorrect zoning map. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Largely Finished 
</P>
<P>
When the error was discovered in 1986, workers had already completed the 
building's concrete superstructure, installed elevator shafts to the 27th floor 
and finished wiring and plumbing for the first 24 stories.

THATCHER'S PLANS BACKFIRING ON HOMEOWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER INTEREST RATES FROM ANTI-INFLATION DRIVE PUT THOUSANDS IN ARREARS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's program to transform Britain into "a 
property-owning democracy" has produced an army of new homeowners. But many are 
being squeezed by her determination to curb inflation by driving up interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage costs have risen at their fastest rate in 50 years, to 13.5% from 
9.75% last summer, confronting many of Britain's 15 million homeowners with 
heavy debt and even the risk of losing their homes, home buyers' advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
Types of mortgages in the United States vary but their rates generally hover 
around 10% to 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now Pays Interest Only 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Manasche, a single mother in Harrow, says her monthly payments have 
jumped 42 pounds ($73.50) to 262 pounds ($458.50), and she had to negotiate a 
temporary agreement with her lender to pay interest only. That brought the 
payment down to 253 pounds ($443), and she is still having trouble keeping up. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel very, very frightened, obviously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch could also make Britons lose confidence in real estate and return to 
renting, undermining Thatcher's initial aims. 
</P>
<P>
"The present government is pulling the rug out from underneath their feet," 
said Michael Brett, secretary general of the National Assn. of Homeowners in 
Shrewsbury. 
</P>
<P>
John Doling, a professor at the University of Birmingham's department of social 
policy, said: "Many people will be deeply depressed, deeply suffering from what 
has happened." Some, he says, "will have to economize on food and they won't 
eat properly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Factors Blamed 
</P>
<P>
But lenders say defaults are more an outcome of unemployment and marital 
breakup than of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
They stress their eagerness to help borrowers in difficulty by, for example, 
extending the term of a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as those people come in and let us know, there are things we can do," 
said Mark Hemingway, a spokesman for the Halifax Building Society, the 
country's biggest mortgage lender. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly payment on a new 40,000-pound ($70,000) 25-year adjustable mortgage 
has risen to 388.42 pounds ($679.74) from about 304.93 pounds ($533.63) last 
summer, the Building Societies Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
Repayments on only the first 30,000 pounds ($52,000) of a mortgage are 
tax-deductible. Most rates fluctuate with interest rates. Fixed rates are 
rarely offered, and 40% of mortgage-holders have their monthly payment adjusted 
once a year. 
</P>
<P>
The squeeze worsened last year when young buyers rushed into the market and 
overcommitted themselves trying to beat the abolition in August of double tax 
relief for unmarried joint mortgage-holders. 
</P>
<P>
"When people see prices going up rapidly they feel they have to be active in 
the housing market right now before it is too late," Doling said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Thatcher's Conservative government began raising interest rates, 
stalling the housing boom so that buyers who came in at the top of the market 
can't get out at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rolling Back Socialism 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher has promoted home ownership as part of her campaign to roll back 
socialism, allowing occupants of rented public housing to buy the property at 
preferential terms. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent of Britain's housing is occupant-owned, compared to 55% in 
1978, the Building Societies Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
But now Thatcher says that inflation, which has jumped to an annual rate of 
6.8% from 3.3% a year ago, is her top priority and interest rates are her 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think many people would find the irony in that," Doling said. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, of the homeowners association, said, "We are predicting a massive rise 
in the number of mortgage arrears and repossession." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when mortgage rates went up to 14%, mortgage arrears doubled, Brett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Today about 300,000 people are in arrears, while last year, 25,000 families saw 
their homes repossessed, Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "As soon as someone falls behind in mortgage payments, 
even if they don't get repossessed, they will get a bad reputation financially 
and will in fact be blighted for life." 
</P>
<P>
The building societies association said up-to-date statistics aren't available 
yet, and it expects arrears and repossession to show a decline because 
unemployment is down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Now It Is Ridiculous' 
</P>
<P>
A 36-year-old bank employee from Liverpool who requested anonymity said: "A 
couple of years ago, the mortgage was affordable. Now it is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Rudman, a 19-year-old advertising saleswoman, bought her Shrewsbury home 
in September with fiance Stephen Chaloner, a 23-year-old software engineer. 
Payments on their 21,000-pound ($36,750) mortgage have risen 57 pounds ($100), 
to 220 pounds ($385) a month. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rudman said, they have to postpone the wedding and lower their living 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
"We were advised by a lot of people, 'You ought to have your own house. Buy 
now.' We panicked really. We just grabbed it," she said.

250 COWS, ONE GOAT ON NAVY'S FARM; 
</P>
<P>
MIDSHIPMEN GET THE CREAM OF DAIRY PRODUCTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 80 years after a typhoid outbreak made officials wary of the local milk 
supply, the U.S. Naval Academy is still running its own dairy. 
</P>
<P>
The cows don't graze on this picture-book campus by the Severn River, but down 
the road a few miles, Naval Academy's 865-acre farm, they share pastures with 
Bill the Goat, the middies' long-horned mascot. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh, rich milk from the herd is much in evidence in King Hall, the cavernous 
dining room where the 4,500 midshipmen take their meals. They empty nearly 
2,500 of the blue-and-gold, half-gallon cartons daily. 
</P>
<P>
There hasn't been any typhoid around Annapolis lately, so why is the academy 
still milking its own cows? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess tradition," said Todd Dander, 21, a second classman from Dallas. 
"That's what everything is around here, tradition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break-Even Operation 
</P>
<P>
Several others speculated that it was cheaper for the academy to have its own 
dairy, but the civilians who milk the 175 to 250 Holstein cows and raise calves 
there don't claim to be underpricing the competition. They acknowledge that the 
farm's staff of 16 is larger than the typical dairy's, but they say they are 
milking only the cows, not the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The dairy supports itself through its sales to the Midshipmen's Mess, not 
federal appropriations, said R. H. (Pete) Peterson, who has run the farm since 
1982, first as a Navy lieutenant commander and, since his retirement in 1984, 
as the civilian manager. 
</P>
<P>
He bristles at any suggestion that the dairy is a white elephant or, as a 
recent newspaper headline suggested, a prime candidate for the budget ax. 
</P>
<P>
As with many great events in naval warfare, academy officials point out that 
this battle has been fought before -- and the middies' dairy won a decisive 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
The battle erupted in 1966, when the Department of Defense, at the urging of 
other local milk producers, suggested selling the farm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liens on Property 
</P>
<P>
But the House Armed Services Committee rose to the defense of the middies' milk 
supply. It determined that if the farm were sold, the money would go not to the 
U.S. Treasury, but to the Midshipmen's store fund, which lent $25,000 to start 
the dairy in Annapolis in 1911. Two years later, Congress lent $155,000 to buy 
the property in Gambrills, Md., 13 miles from the academy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some bright genius . . . wants to close this dairy over at Annapolis. This 
will be done over my prostrate body," Rep. L. Mendel Rivers (D-S. C.), the 
autocratic committee chairman, barked at a hearing in October, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"We have developed a grade of milk over there that is wonderful, absolutely 
wonderful. . . . " Rivers declared. "There is no reason to dispose of this 
property, no reason on Earth. It is owned by the young men over there." 
</P>
<P>
None of the 16 staffers on the farm is a civil servant. All except a secretary 
live at the dairy, where the workday begins before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Staffed Enterprise 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's not a self-owned operation where you work until you drop, we have 
more employees than a farm this size would take in a private, commercial 
operation," said Peterson, a former supply officer who appears every bit the 
farmer in well-worn jeans, boots, plaid shirt and Dekalb cap. 
</P>
<P>
The Midshipmen's Mess orders 1,282 gallons of 2%-butterfat milk a day and pays 
$1.66 for each gallon. The dairy also prepares orange juice, iced tea and other 
drinks for the middies. 
</P>
<P>
The milk cartons, decorated with anchors and the Naval Academy insignia, are 
stamped with the date the milk came from the cow, usually two days before it 
winds up on the midshipmen's tables. 
</P>
<P>
Upperclassmen talk wistfully of the milkshakes they used to get from the cream 
skimmed off the milk, and Peterson said the academy recently restored homemade 
ice cream to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Of half a dozen midshipmen polled between classes, all but one knew about the 
dairy. 
</P>
<P>
Ralita Hildebrand, 18, of Beaver Creek, Ohio, said: "I knew after plebe summer 
started, because everybody made such a big deal about bringing the milk cartons 
home for parents' weekend. All the parents wanted to take a milk carton back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fields, Not Houses 
</P>
<P>
If commercial dairymen once looked askance at the Navy's farm, its neighbors in 
Anne Arundel County, Md., now regard it as a green buffer zone between them and 
encroaching development, Jack Merritt, the farm superintendent, said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much more widespread and vigorous sympathy for us staying here, 
simply because the alternative appears to be another 48,000 houses," Merritt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reeder, director of member relations for the Maryland and Virginia Milk 
Producers Co-operative, said the $1.66 the academy pays for its milk "is 
probably a competitive price." He said the other dairies would prefer that the 
academy buy milk from them, "but we haven't made any effort at all since (the 
1960s) to do anything about it."

Terry White says after having his 1964 Buick Skylark stolen and damaged last 
November, the last thing he expected was a handwritten letter of apology. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to apologize and ask that my apology be accepted for the 
inconvenience that my friends and I put you through in stealing your car," the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally did not know the car was stolen and I am sorry for getting in it 
without permission. I'll never accept another ride from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed, but police said they could not confirm that the person 
who signed the letter was involved in the car theft. 
</P>
<P>
White said he was thrilled to receive the letter and accepts the apology. 
</P>
<P>
"But I hope he has learned his lesson. He got off lucky this time," White said.

MALAYSIA'S KING HOLDS A SOMETIME JOB AND DOESN'T EVEN GET A CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a land where the kings take turns and have no coronations because they 
wear no crowns. 
</P>
<P>
But when the latest in the monarchal rotation kisses a wavy-bladed dagger April 
26, he will become the Yang di-Pertuan Agung -- the one who is chief among the 
most prominent. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth agung since the country's independence from Britain in 1957, he will 
keep his throne until 1994, then turn it over to an elected successor. Neither 
the public nor Parliament has a vote. That privilege is limited to the heads of 
Malaysia's nine royal houses. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is chosen by secret ballot of his fellow monarchs for a five-year 
reign as king of kings for this Southeast Asian federation of 17 million. When 
his term is up, he returns to his home state, where his throne has been kept 
warm in his absence by his eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have hereditary rulers. The others have to make do 
with a governor, named by the agung acting on the advice of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The new agung is Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, 60, the sultan of Perak, who was 
elected March 2. He is a lawyer and career civil servant who was lord president 
of the Supreme Court in 1982-84. He left the judiciary to succeed his late 
father in 1985 as head of the Perak royal household. 
</P>
<P>
Although not as wealthy as most of the other rulers, Sultan Azlan is widely 
regarded as the best educated. He attended the then-prestigious Government 
English School, where the sons of royal and well-to-do Malays were groomed for 
government service in colonial days. From there he went to the University of 
Nottingham and Lincoln's Inn, both in Britain, and was called to the English 
bar in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
The rotating throne solved a sticky protocol problem when Malaysia, then known 
as Malaya, shed its colonial ties with Britain in 1957. Because none of the 
state rulers would have been accepted by the rest as permanent head of state, 
then-Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman devised the unusual system of giving 
every state with a ruler a turn on the throne. 
</P>
<P>
Years later in retirement, the Tunku, himself a prince of the royal house of 
Kedah, said the agung was vested "with all the powers such as those given to 
sovereigns of Great Britain and other democratic monarchies of the world. . . . 
As symbolic head of state, the agung never interferes with the actual running 
of the government." 
</P>
<P>
Political power rests in a British-style national Parliament and state 
legislatures, which are elected every five years. 
</P>
<P>
In eight years in office, the current prime minister, Mahathir Mohammed, has 
had uneven relations with the royal houses. His government tried in 1983 to 
abolish the king's veto over legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The rulers resisted, and Mahathir took his case to the country with a series of 
public rallies. A compromise was reached in which Mahathir agreed that the 
agung could delay legislation and send it back to Parliament for review, but if 
it passed again, it would become law. 
</P>
<P>
Seven states call their hereditary rulers sultans. Perlis makes do with a 
rajah, and Negri Sembilan refers to its ruler as Yang di-Pertuan Besar, one who 
is chief of state. 
</P>
<P>
The state rulers provide a continuing focus for Malay identity in a country in 
which Malays account for about half the population, which also includes sizable 
Chinese and Indian minorities. Sultans function as important arbiters of Malay 
custom and religion. 
</P>
<P>
Some royals are criticized for their love of big cars, large palaces, frequent 
trips abroad and aloofness toward their subjects. They are paid the equivalent 
of about $23,440 a month. But most nurture their subjects, fulfilling the role 
of benevolent leader. 
</P>
<P>
Only the nine-member Council of Rulers can oust an agung, by majority vote. 
Agungs are bound by the constitution "to act at all times on the advice of the 
Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
An agung can be reelected for a second consecutive term, but none has been. 
There is a tacit agreement among the rulers that once an agung's term is 
completed, he returns to his state palace to give someone else a turn. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy king, or timbalan agung, also is selected, which has proved a prudent 
thing to do because three of the eight previous agungs died in office.

GARDENER KEEPS 170 FLOWER BEDS IN HEART OF WASHINGTON FILLED; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S GOT THE BLOOMING SITUATION IN HAND 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The capital is awash in daffodils, masses of tulips proclaim the arrival of 
spring, and Milton Boston already is worrying about planting thousands of 
geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Boston is chief floral gardener for the National Park Service in downtown 
Washington, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who oversees the yearlong 
planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol to the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
186,150 Tulips Planted 
</P>
<P>
His job might seem staggering to back-yard putterers. For a month in late fall, 
the efficient, unflappable Boston and his crew of eight gardeners were busy 
planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300 daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which 
bloom in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled, fumigated with weed 
and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and peat moss and planted with 
bright, hardy annuals for Washington's hot summer months. They are weeded and 
fertilized until they die in the first frost. Then, they are replaced with 
about 3,000 chrysanthemums. Eventually, the beds are cleared and the cycle 
starts again in November. 
</P>
<P>
Boston, a 26-year Park Service veteran, is especially proud of the "tulip 
library," a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of the clarions of spring 
that lies near the Tidal Basin south of the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
95 Different Varieties 
</P>
<P>
This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them imported from 
Holland. Each of the 95 beds contains a different variety, with names as 
dazzling as their colors -- Queen of Night, Merry Widow, Apeldoorn, Oriental 
Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming Parrot, Estella Rijnveld. 
</P>
<P>
It is so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the Dutch Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Boston says that he gets "great satisfaction" from his work, which delights the 
more than 23 million tourists who visit Washington's national parks and 
monuments each year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is always what I wanted to do," said Boston, 45, who grew up on his 
father's farm in eastern North Carolina and migrated to Washington after high 
school. "All my life, I've been used to growing things." 
</P>
<P>
His annual $330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs purchased 
wholesale from growers, many from neighboring Maryland and Virginia, on the 
basis of competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
During plantings, Boston's crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can leave a flower 
bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour is over. 
</P>
<P>
"They really work hard and do a good job," Boston said of his eight Park 
Service helpers. "They're all gardeners, and they know what they're doing. They 
can plant 20,000 bulbs in one day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flowers Seldom Stolen 
</P>
<P>
In a city beset by violent crime, Boston is pleased that his flowers are almost 
never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler intent on selling them for 
spare change. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess people enjoy them so they don't take them," he said. "About the only 
problem is when people stand in the beds to pose for pictures and mash the 
flowers down." 
</P>
<P>
Boston said he once had "the best-looking yard in the neighborhood" in suburban 
Capitol Heights, Md., where he lives with his wife and two children, "but, in 
this job, I don't have the time anymore to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
His loss is Washington's gain.

VIRGINIA SETS UP POLICE LIBRARY OF GENE PRINTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Virginia is going to have the first state laboratory in the nation with a data 
bank of genetic prints, which enable police to identify criminals from scanty 
physical evidence, such as saliva left at a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services will provide DNA 
testing for the state's police and sheriff's departments beginning May 1. 
</P>
<P>
DNA testing is "the most significant development for law enforcement since 
fingerprinting, and that dates back about 100 years," said Paul B. Ferrara, 
director of the state Bureau of Forensic Science. 
</P>
<P>
The lab will develop a computerized library of DNA prints from known sex 
offenders in the state. 
</P>
<P>
A state law passed last month requires sex offenders to give blood samples. 
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes of cells from 
saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bone marrow. Only identical twins can 
have the same DNA pattern, or genetic blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genetic Blueprint 
</P>
<P>
Scientists in recent years have developed technology for taking DNA from body 
fluids or from tissue left at a crime scene, and matching it with the genetic 
blueprint of a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"If a rapist leaves seminal fluid at the scene . . . he might as well be 
leaving his Social Security card," Ferrara said. 
</P>
<P>
He said DNA testing already has helped to solve one case in Virginia. Timothy 
Spencer, of Richmond, was convicted of three capital murders on the basis of 
genetic printing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a lawyer, but, based on what I've been told, Timothy Spencer probably 
never would have been convicted without the DNA testing," Ferrara said. The 
case is under review by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara said DNA testing also could serve as a crime deterrent. He said 
criminals can be careful not to leave fingerprints, as Spencer was, but the 
chances of committing a violent crime without leaving any source of a DNA 
sample are slim. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, analysis of body fluids, tissue or hair left at crime scenes 
consisted of examining enzymes and blood types -- processes that could 
eliminate a suspect but could not positively identify the guilty party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Fingerprints' 
</P>
<P>
"Conventional serologic evidence was always circumstantial," Ferrara said. "You 
could say that a particular sample could have come from, say, 13% of the male 
population, but with DNA testing you can say this sample definitely came from 
that person. It's just like fingerprints in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
DNA is inherited, half from each parent. For about 10 years, scientists have 
used DNA testing to determine paternity and to study genetically related 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, DNA testing was first used to solve a rape in a small 
town in England, Ferrara said. The technology has since been used to solve 
several crimes in the United States, but Virginia is one of the first states to 
begin collecting samples on a broad scale.

Helicopters from the carrier Theodore Roosevelt rescued 15 Britons from four

The U.S. 6th Fleet said the 35-foot Harlequin called for help before dawn 
Thursday when its captain fell and broke his leg as the sailboat struggled in 
30-foot seas and 70-knot winds. Three other sailboats sent distress calls by 
sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dayton W. Ritt, the Roosevelt's commanding officer, said helicopters took 
off from the nuclear-powered carrier at first light. Fourteen men and one woman 
were flown to safety during the six-hour rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper of the Harlequin, Malcolm Cross, was in stable condition with a 
fractured right leg, doctors said. The other crew members were in good 
condition aboard the carrier.

CITY HALL; 
</P>
<P>
BYZANTINE-STYLE L.A. LANDMARK WILL GET A NEW LOOK WITH RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was the Daily Planet in the old "Superman" television series. It was 
destroyed by Martian invaders in the movie "War of the Worlds," but somehow 
survived to portray the U.S. Capitol and the Vatican in other productions. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, it has been the scene of bombings, riots, suicides and shouting 
matches. It also has played host to kings and queens -- and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Now, City Hall -- perhaps Los Angeles' most recognizable landmark -- is the 
first project in a public-private effort to restore the city's historic public 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to begin this spring, a $6-million face-lift -- $1 million more than 
City Hall cost to build in 1928 -- includes illuminating the building at night 
and sprucing up the tower where, in the days before radar, a beacon shot a beam 
of light toward Los Angeles' airport as an aid to pilots. The beacon, along 
with a light that blinked "L.A." in Morse code, was turned off during World War 
II for fear it would attract enemy bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned as part of the renovation is a City Hall museum to display 
hundreds of gifts that the city has received, many from visiting dignitaries 
but others from ordinary people. The gifts -- now often packed away in closets 
-- range from a Shinto shrine, presented by Los Angeles' sister city of Nagoya, 
Japan, to a magician's wand, presented by performer Doug Henning. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mayor Bradley waves this wand, may the smog and all other problems in Los 
Angeles vanish," says the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring a stepped, pyramidal tower, the Byzantine-style City Hall was -- at 
27 stories -- the tallest building in Southern California until a municipal 
height limit was repealed in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
It is Los Angeles' fourth City Hall, replacing a two-story brick building on 
Broadway, the site of which now holds a parking garage. The new City Hall was 
built across the street from where a one-story adobe building served as the 
first seat of city government from 1853 to 1884. 
</P>
<P>
The builders used sand from every California county and water from each of the 
state's 21 missions. The landscaping reinforced the local pride, containing a 
rich sprinkling of the city's official flower -- the bird of paradise. 
</P>
<P>
According to Robert Winter's and David Gebhard's "A Guide to Architecture in 
Los Angeles," the form of the building was influenced by Bertram Goodhue's 
design for the Nebraska State Capitol, a monumental tower placed on a Beaux 
Arts base. "The top of the tower seems to be a '20s interpretation of what the 
Mausoleum of Halicarnassus must have looked like," they wrote, referring to the 
landmark tomb on the Aegean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned because the structure would be so tall in an earthquake-prone area 
and because facades made of terra cotta are subject to cracking under movement, 
the architects had the tower constructed with a compressible joint at each 
floor -- just like a human spine -- so that they could safely ride out the 
waves of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The safeguard has worked as planned in subsequent temblors. After each 
earthquake, building superintendent Joe Miller walks up 27 stories -- he does 
not take the elevator for fear that it might get stuck -- to check for leaks in 
two 5,000-gallon tanks in the tower, which provide water to the building. 
</P>
<P>
While most people rush through City Hall -- as they would through any office 
building -- tending to their business with heads down, failing to notice the 
structure's architectural and historical significance, Miller is one of those 
who relish the landmark's obscure details. For him and other history buffs, the 
ghosts of City Hall come alive at every corner. 
</P>
<P>
The building's April 26, 1928, dedication -- billed as the largest civic 
procession ever staged west of Chicago -- featured a parade several miles long, 
including 32,000 marchers, among them gray-haired Civil War veterans, 34 bands, 
hundreds of floats and songs sung by Irving Berlin. Some of the windows in the 
new building were broken by the concussion from aerial bombs discharged during 
the dedication. President Calvin Coolidge capped off the festivities by 
pressing a telegraph key in the White House to light the tower beacon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shower Still There 
</P>
<P>
A newspaper report trumpeted "one of the up-to-the-minute furnishings of Los 
Angeles' new civic home -- the shower for the mayor." The shower is still 
there, and Mayor Tom Bradley occasionally uses it, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"Flashlight photographs can be taken in the mayor's office, as a special motor 
arrangement will quietly blow the flashlight smoke out of the room," the 
article said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuspidors were also purchased for each councilman, but they are no longer in 
use. A 1928 Times story noted that each councilman also got a telephone stand 
"so that he will not knock the telephone off the desk with his feet." 
</P>
<P>
"If a citizen should call his city councilman during the next 10 days and be 
told by his secretary that the municipal statesman is out, the probable cause 
is that the councilman is downtown shopping for furnishings for his office," 
another article said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the questioning of the expenditures, one councilman asked 
indignantly, "You wouldn't want us to move the old furniture into the new City 
Hall, would you?" 
</P>
<P>
A 1928 manual for elevator operators instructed that there be "no one floor 
stops except for aged or injured people." 
</P>
<P>
An American flag originally flew from the top of City Hall, but it was moved to 
a ground-level pole when it kept getting tangled up in the revolving Morse code 
light. 
</P>
<P>
It is around the corner from the 85-foot-high flagpole that the public -- 
including thousands of schoolchildren and tourists who come for free weekday 
tours -- enter City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The main Spring Street entrance is a gateway into civic history. The two large 
bronze doors feature sculptured panels commemorating events such as the arrival 
of the first Spanish expedition to Los Angeles in 1769 and the opening of the 
Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the building, visitors are greeted by a holograph showing Mayor Tom 
Bradley holding a telephone. It was donated by a holograph company. 
</P>
<P>
Next is the domed rotunda, where the body of Police Chief William Parker lay in 
state in 1966. "The floor of the rotunda, passages and vestibule consists of 
marble of many kinds, colors and forms, laid in geometric designs, producing a 
complete scheme of intricately shaped circular patterns, interlaced bands and 
checkered fields," notes the 1928 Board of Public Works guide. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the floor, surrounded by marble columns, is a brass design of 
an old Spanish ship that might have once plied the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Down the marble-lined corridor, the wooden doors to the city clerk's office are 
carved with the symbols of the four governments that have had control over Los 
Angeles: The lion and castle of Spain, the eagle and serpent of Mexico, the 
grizzly bear of the California Republic and the Stars and Stripes of the United 
States. The symbols collectively make up the city seal. 
</P>
<P>
In a dark hallway outside the city controller's office is a badly tarnished 
plaque installed in 1941 commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 
Workman-Rowland expedition, the first large group of Americans to settle in Los 
Angeles. Painted on another ceiling are portraits of prominent figures in the 
discovery of California, such as Spanish explorers Juan Cabrillo, who entered 
Santa Monica Bay in 1542, and Gaspar de Portola, who led an expedition here in 
1781. 
</P>
<P>
Why some designs were chosen -- such as the signs of the Zodiac painted on the 
ceiling outside the mayor's office -- is a mystery. "When I look at Zodiacs and 
some of those things, I sort of have the feeling those were pure decoration," 
said Anthony T. Heinsbergen, whose late father helped decorate City Hall. "We 
have the tendency to analyze those kinds of things much more than they did 
then. Ornaments were ornaments for ornament's sake. They didn't always have a 
particular significance." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the cathedral-like council chamber, with its barrel-vaulted ceiling, are 
marble columns decorated with the seals of 48 states. Alaska and Hawaii joined 
the Union later. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber has been the scene of real and fictional drama. Sheep were marched 
into it in the film "Chinatown" to protest the diversion of water from 
agriculture to serve Los Angeles' growing population. Several years ago, two 
council members almost got into a fistfight there. More recently, it was the 
arena for a Dodger stadium peanut vendor, who demonstrated his skill by tossing 
bags to council members. 
</P>
<P>
Former Councilman Art Snyder once helped in the performance of a magician, who 
was being honored by the council, by shooting a gun in the chamber. The 
magician -- not the same one who gave the mayor his wand -- caught the bullet . 
. . with his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, the chamber was ordered locked after meetings because of an invasion 
of cockroaches. The pests were attracted to crumbs left behind by city 
employees who used to eat their lunches there. 
</P>
<P>
It was here in 1966 that the council voted to install automated water 
sprinklers on the City Hall lawn, a move intended to rout loiterers. Twenty 
years later, council members opened City Hall to the homeless as a shelter 
after several street people died from subfreezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Today, pigeons can occasionally be seen flying around the chamber during 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of City Hall is the tower. The highest floor accessible to the 
public features an observation deck that once offered a panorama of the vast 
Los Angeles Basin and the Pacific Ocean, but the view now is partly obscured by 
nearby high-rises and smog. 
</P>
<P>
A sign on a rarely used door to the very top of City Hall, off limits to the 
public, warns city employees to never go out alone "because if you are injured 
or suffer a heart attack, nobody would know you're up here," said Brookes 
Treidler of the General Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, a carillon was carried up to the 24th floor, along with 
400-watt amplifiers, so that the chimes of Christmas carols could be projected 
out into the city during the holiday season, audible up to three miles away. 
Also at that time of year, in the days before court decisions ruled out such 
practices, the lights of City Hall were left on at night to form a huge cross. 
</P>
<P>
Project Restore, a nonprofit organization made up of business and civic 
leaders, was formed after Public Works Commissioner Edward J. Avila made some 
pleasant discoveries in 1985 while trying to upgrade the dreary chambers where 
his commission has met since the building opened. When the heavy drapes were 
removed for cleaning, Avila discovered that natural light cascaded into the 
room through the tall windows. And when black cord padding was pried off the 
walls, it revealed white pumice tiles that give the room and its vaulted 
ceiling added brightness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'All These Great Things' 
</P>
<P>
"I've been walking around these halls for a long time, and suddenly I've 
started looking up," Avila said. "I see all these great things on the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
Project Restore is patterned after the nonprofit group that restored the Statue 
of Liberty, said Chairman Albert C. Martin Jr., son of one of the three 
architects who designed City Hall. The Los Angeles landmark is "a symbol equal 
in civic consciousness to the Statue of Liberty," said the younger Martin, 
himself an architect. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the group has raised about $1.5 million, with the largest contribution 
of $350,000 coming from the Community Redevelopment Agency, while a few hundred 
city employees have agreed to 50-cent deductions from their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
After City Hall, the restoration effort will move on to San Pedro and Van Nuys 
municipal buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pews Replaced 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the restoration involves returning wooden pews to the Board 
of Public Works' meeting room. The pews were replaced years ago -- no one knows 
what happened to them (Avila suspects that they are sitting in a church 
somewhere) -- with chairs bolted to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The project includes repairing earthquake-caused cracks in the terra cotta 
covering the outside of City Hall. Also planned is the reinstallation of a 
giant chandelier that hung in the rotunda but was removed after the 1933 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Project Restore officials also hope to create reproductions of the original 
wooden elevator cars. The city had one of the ornamental cars left, but an 
employee last year inadvertently sold it to a San Fernando Valley junk dealer, 
who is demanding $10,000 from the city to return it, according to Project 
Restore President Kathy Moret. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Souvenir Shop 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the museum displaying gifts to the city, a shop is planned to 
sell souvenirs, such as plastic, miniature City Halls. 
</P>
<P>
Under study is a shifting of City Council members' desks so they face the 
audience. Now, the council's horseshoe-shaped meeting desk has been positioned 
so that the lawmakers have their backs to citizens appearing before the body. 
</P>
<P>
Moret goes rummaging through city warehouses when she hears about something 
that used to be in City Hall. That's how she found the rotunda chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet found is a device that was installed in the early '50s to measure 
atomic particles drifting into Los Angeles from nuclear test sites near Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
However, the beacon that pointed its light toward what is now Los Angeles 
International Airport is still in storage. But no one can think of any use for 
it.

WHAT GIVES IN L.A.? JUST ABOUT ANYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Shopping for a gift for the city that has everything? 
</P>
<P>
How about samurai warrior headgear? Or a bowie knife? Or a genuine Australian 
boomerang. 
</P>
<P>
Those are among the thousands of items that have been given to the city of Los 
Angeles over the years. And, if all goes as planned, many of the gifts will be 
exhibited in a City Hall museum, built as part of the building's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gifts already are on display, such as an entire tea room given by 
Los Angeles' sister city of Nagoya, Japan, and set up in a park in Hollywood. A 
bell from South Korea sits atop a bluff overlooking Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands sent us hundreds of thousands of tulips, which were planted by 
the Recreation and Parks Department all over the city," said Bee Canterbury 
Lavery, the city's chief of protocol. The mayor's mansion was a gift from Getty 
Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Many other gifts, however, are stuffed away in closets in the office of Mayor 
Tom Bradley, who usually accepts them on behalf of the city. City officials 
have no idea how many are stashed away there -- and often don't know now who 
gave them. 
</P>
<P>
Some gifts are practical and readily used. The Fire Department, for instance, 
welcomes discarded airplane fuselages, which it sets afire and uses for 
training. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the city welcomes gifts of cash, such as the $3.24 million 
donated by the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation for rebuilding the Hollywood Library, 
destroyed by fire. And undoubtedly the most generous gift was a piece of 
property -- the 3,015 acres donated by Col. Griffith J. Griffith in 1896 for 
use as a park. 
</P>
<P>
But not everything offered is accepted. The Library Department gets calls from 
people proposing to give back issues of National Geographic "every time 
somebody cleans out a garage," but it declines because it has plenty of the 
magazines, spokesman Robert Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The city gives gifts too. 
</P>
<P>
The standard one that Bradley presents to visiting dignitaries is, of course, a 
key to the city. "We even have a lock that it unlocks," Lavery said. The part 
of the key that fits into the lock contains a miniature reproduction of City 
Hall.

KEZAR STADIUM GETS PARTIES, WRECKING BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kezar Stadium, football home for thousands of high school, college and 
professional athletes, will have two more celebrations -- and a 
going-out-of-business sale -- before the wrecking ball flattens it. 
</P>
<P>
Kezar, which was midwife to the birth of the "Alley Oop" pass and the "shotgun" 
offense, will be destroyed to make way for a $9 million project that will 
feature a new, smaller field for high school competition. 
</P>
<P>
For nostalgia buffs, souvenirs will be available. A chunk of bench with Kezar 
burned into it will cost $20. A whole row -- about 10 feet long -- will set you 
back $100. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll sell anything anyone wants to make an offer on, if we can," said Leslie 
Schemel, executive director of the Friends of Recreation and Park. "The 
scoreboard is missing all its transformers, or whatever you call them, but 
maybe someone will buy it as a fixer-upper." 
</P>
<P>
If everyone who played there since it was built in 1925 shows up for the 
parties, the place will probably collapse without any help. 
</P>
<P>
The stars who battled at Kezar included Frankie Albert, the legendary Stanford 
University quarterback who played for and later coached the San Francisco 
49ers, who abandoned the stadium in 1971 for Candlestick Park. He was surprised 
to find out the stadium would be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it fell down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to start about mid-April," Deborah Learner of the San Francisco 
Recreation and Parks Commission said of the date for destruction. The 
commission will sponsor a "Farewell to Old Kezar Party" on April 6 and a "Field 
Day" for anyone who wants to visit the stadium April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the new stadium will begin in October and will, ironically, 
result in a structure that resembles the old Kezar. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans called for taking away only the top and leaving 10,000 seats in 
the bowl. Now the entire structure will be crushed and removed for construction 
of new stands, 5,000 on either side between the goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
This, said Learner, will mean a below-ground-level stadium that will resemble 
the original. A 40,000-seat above-ground-level superstructure was added in 
1928. 
</P>
<P>
Alyn Beals played at Kezar as a high school athlete and later as a star in 
college and the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Beals graduated in 1939 from Poly High School, located right across from the 
stadium. He then went to Santa Clara University, which played homes games at 
Kezar, and later played with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"Kezar was great in those days," he said. "It was the center of attention for 
everything. Everybody played there, the high schools, the colleges and then the 
49ers." 
</P>
<P>
But the times caught up with the stadium. It was cursed through the years for 
its rough rail benches, primitive press box and often soggy grass field. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Chronicle columnist Art Rosenbaum recalled those tight seats. 
</P>
<P>
"A good seat was one in front of a tiny woman," he wrote. "If a 6-foot-6 guy 
with long legs sat behind, you knew your rear would ache next day from scapula 
to lumbar." 
</P>
<P>
But he also recounted with some affection the pre-television days of the 
gridiron when it didn't take pro talent to bring in the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
It was high school rivals Poly and Lowell that were the first to fill all 
59,600 seats at the enlarged stadium, Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara-St. Mary's games when Buck Shaw's Broncos took on Slip 
Madigan's Gaels "were sell-outs for many years." 
</P>
<P>
For others, Kezar will be mostly remembered as the place where the shotgun 
offense was unveiled in 1960 by 49er coach Howard "Red" Hickey, who simply 
rotated John Brodie, Bill Kilmer and Bobby Waters at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Kezar was also the birthplace of the "Alley Oop" pass from Y.A. Tittle to R.C. 
Owens, whose leaping ability gave the pass its moniker. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be nostalgia there for me," said Owens, whose catches 
thrilled crowds from 1957 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium tunnel, which led from the locker room to the south end zone, 
became a legend because it was used by both teams. The fans were very close and 
routinely pelted the visitors with beer and garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans were right on top of you there," Owens recalled. "They were right in 
your ear, and you could hear everything they'd say -- some good and some bad." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the fans started bombarding the 49ers and a wire screen was 
erected. 
</P>
<P>
Things got worse. 
</P>
<P>
The last NFL game at Kezar was played on Jan. 3, 1971 when the Dallas Cowboys 
beat San Francisco 17-10.

PIMLICO'S GLITZY 'PALACE' IS A SIGN OF REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pimlico opened its new Sports Palace to the public this week -- and it's a 
knockout. It is as stunning to see such a glitzy facility in the midst of this 
cavernous old racetrack as it would be to find it in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first major improvement that Frank De Francis and his partners have 
made since they bought the track in late 1986. "Because Pimlico didn't have 
anything yet, we wanted to knock everybody's hats off with the Sports Palace," 
said Lynda O'Dea, who designed it. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility is, of course, modeled after the Sports Palace at Laurel that 
has attracted widespread attention in the racing industry. But the room at 
Laurel had some negatives because of its location -- it was too far from the 
clubhouse and the paddock, and it was completely enclosed. A patron could spend 
the day without seeing a live horse. But there was a perfect spot for Pimlico's 
Sports Palace -- the fourth floor of the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Palace patrons can step out to a glass-enclosed terrace, with 160 
executive-style swivel chairs, and watch the horses run live. Or they can watch 
the races on any three giant screens inside the Sports Palace; dining tables 
face two of the screens, a large circular bar faces the other. 
</P>
<P>
As at Laurel, the Pimlico Sports Palace has banks of computers where 
horseplayers can study statistical data and apply it to the day's races; also 
television monitors where they can watch reruns of previous races. For the 
benefit of neophytes, Pimlico has a "Racing Information Center" that offers 
short film presentations on basics of handicapping -- speed, class, pace, 
breeding, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The decor of the room is, in a word, dramatic. O'Dea utilized Pimlico's 
traditional colors of black and yellow with touches of plum and teal. Walls are 
black with brass moldings. Tables have black and gold tiles imported from 
Italy. Three large, elegant chandeliers hang over the room. 
</P>
<P>
People who are relative newcomers to Maryland racing might not be so dazzled by 
such innovations as old-timers are. After all, casinos routinely offer their 
customers such style and comfort. But for horseplayers who came here when the 
Cohen family owned the place and General Manager Chick Lang was running it, 
such luxury would have been unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
The other day I was cleaning out a closet and came across a yellowing copy of 
The Washington Post with a column I wrote on a day after Pimlico had drawn a 
pitiful crowd of 4,461. 
</P>
<P>
It said: "If Maryland racing were a person instead of a multimillion-dollar 
industry, it might be time to summon a priest to administer the last rites. 
</P>
<P>
There is no mystery about the reasons for the decline of Maryland's once-proud 
racing circuit. Facilities at most of the track's are dreadful. Bowie is a 
despicable eyesore; Timonium is bush league, Pimlico's grandstand is a gloomy, 
smoky glass box. ... " 
</P>
<P>
This was not ancient history. This was March 1984, and the racing industry 
definitely was headed for minor-league status, largely because track 
managements refused to treat their customers decently and were giving those 
customers away. 
</P>
<P>
De Francis bought Laurel, and then Pimlico, with the hope of luring back these 
defectors by improving the quality of his product, and the construction of 
Laurel's Sports Palace was his first big move in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea of the Sports Palace -- with its Las Vegas sports ticker and its 
abundance of handicapping aids -- was to appeal to serious bettors. It was a 
sign that this new management knew its customers and was trying to cater to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
This attitude brought bigger crowds, then bigger purses, then better-quality 
racing, and finally national recognition that Maryland is the most booming 
sector of American racing. 
</P>
<P>
So the new Pimlico Sports Palace evokes enthusiasm not only because it promises 
to be a very pleasant, comfortable place to play the horses. It is a vivid 
symbol of the whole revival of racing here.

PORTLAND'S BRANCH IS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT HIS RESERVE STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Maryland star Adrian Branch was embarrassed that the media flocked to 
him after Portland dropped a last-second game in Washington last week. "But 
it's home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Branch is a reserve for Portland, after NBA stops in Chicago, Cleveland, Los 
Angeles and New Jersey. You may remember the last time you saw Branch. 
</P>
<P>
It was right after the Lakers had beaten Boston for the 1987 title, and if you 
looked closely, you could see Branch in the champagne-shower celebration. But 
even then, he knew he wasn't long for Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I was treating every game like it was my last," said Branch, who has appeared 
in 57 games this season for the Trail Blazers and averages eight points a game 
as a reserve, "not having the comfortable cushion of having an extended 
contract. But it's been fun while it lasted, and give or take one or two things 
I did or didn't do, I've maxed out on my opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Portland took a look at Branch this summer and invited him to camp. He was not 
given much of a shot to make the club and wasn't put in the team's media guide. 
But he has shot 47 percent from the floor and is the Trail Blazers' 
instant-offense type. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't worry about what you can't do, just concentrate on what you can do," 
he said. "And take it from there, just go out there and boogie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the coaches deciding to take a chance on me. And they liked what 
they saw. I always felt I was ready to come out of the blocks, but what I saw 
and what other people have seen was sometimes different." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley has been cleared to resume practicing with 
his teammates as part of a continuation of his after-care program, a team 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley, on suspension for a drug-related violation, will attend the Mavericks' 
practice Thursday morning, said Kevin Sullivan, director of media services for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dave Lewis of the ASAP Family Treatment Program in Van Nuys, Calif., gave 
the okay for Tarpley to practice, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy to date has been in complete compliance with his after-care plan and we 
want him to continue that recovery plan," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him to begin to practice with the team and see how he handles that 
situation. We will continue to assess his progress. If he continues to be in 
compliance, we'll go to the next step." 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley was suspended from NBA action Jan. 5 for failure to comply with his 
league-mandated after-care program. Tuesday night's game against the Utah Jazz 
is the 46th he has missed since the suspension. He has lost $6,300 for each 
missed contest. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tarpley can practice with the Mavericks, he cannot be removed from the 
suspended list, Sullivan said. He cannot travel with the team nor can he attend 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
A nice touch from the Phoenix Suns when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played his last 
regular-season game there: among the farewell gifts given to Abdul-Jabbar was a 
Kennedy 1964 half dollar mounted on a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Not much, until you recall Abdul-Jabbar's history involving Phoenix and Kennedy 
half dollars. 
</P>
<P>
On March 19, 1969, the Milwaukee Bucks and Suns flipped for the rights to the 
first pick overall, using a Kennedy half dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Then-commissioner Walter Kennedy flipped. The Suns called heads. It came up 
tails. Milwaukee took the then-Lew Alcindor. Phoenix took Florida's Neal Walk. 
The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Michael Jordan is tearing it up at point guard, triple-doublewise and 
otherwise, might the Chicago Bulls be rethinkig their draft strategy? 
</P>
<P>
Before the move, it was almost a certainty that Chicago would be looking for 
someone to replace Sam Vincent, someone who could hit a jumper and distribute 
the ball to Jordan and friends, or a power forward. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they've found the point guard -- Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see Michael play point guard the rest of his career," Bulls 
Coach Doug Collins told the Chicago Tribune. "Of course, that would change our 
draft picture. But that's my opinion, and the draft is up to Jerry" Krause, the 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of rearranged priorities, the Clippers sound more and more like a team 
that will deal its lottery pick, which, if things continue the way they are, 
will be no worse than fifth or sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Their first priority is finding a jump-shooting guard, though, and there 
probably aren't any in the league available better than Michigan's Glen Rice or 
Arizona's Sean Elliott. But if you're the New Jersey Nets, and you don't have a 
first, do you make a call out west about Buck Williams? Larry Brown has already 
said the Spurs would consider dealing their first pick if Williams' name came 
up. 
</P>
<P>
In another for-instance, Brown mentioned another Williams. Name of John. Plays 
for the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are playing very well right now, especially at home, but unless 
things change drastically they're going to be playing either Detroit (3-1 
against Boston this season) or Cleveland in the first round. Despite the 
Pistons' manhandling of the Celtics in the playoffs last season, it may be 
worse for Boston to play the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
After Cleveland pounded Boston in the Richfield Coliseum Sunday, the Hartford 
Courant noted that Cleveland has held Boston to its two worst shooting 
performances of the season, has beaten Boston seven straight times in the 
Coliseum by an average of 17.4 points and that Boston is 0-20 against winning 
teams on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Add Portland: It's obvious that firing Mike Schuler and trading Kiki Vandeweghe 
haven't provided the spark the Trail Blazers were hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
When Portland fired Schuler Feb. 18, the team was 25-22. It proceeded to lose 
three in a row. On Feb. 23 they traded Vandeweghe to the Knicks for New York's 
1989 first choice, after Vandeweghe nixed a deal that would have sent him to 
Indiana. Since then, the Trail Blazers are 8-13 and in danger of being caught 
by Dallas for the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rick Adelman was upset after Friday's loss because of lapses that, he 
said, contributed greatly to the Trail Blazers' recent six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"When you keep giving up offensive rebounds, you have to be perfect at the 
end," he said. "That's real frustrating. I just feel until our team realizes 
it, that you have to do it for 48 minutes, you can't just do it for six or 
seven minutes at a clip, we're going to keep having disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lapses in each game. The only game that was different was the Knick 
game, when we were ahead, and then we had a lapse in the middle of the fourth 
period that got them in the game. We've been playing well enough in stretches 
but not consistently for 48 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that is the Sacramento Kings who have gone 7-8 since starting the season 
15-41. A .467 pace doesn't sound like a lot, until you consider they were 
playing at a .275 clip beforehand. And in those seven wins are victories over 
Houston, Golden State, Phoenix and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The trades bringing Wayman Tisdale and Danny Ainge west are more than just 
coincidentally related to the upsurge. Ainge has averaged 21.7 points since 
coming to the Kings, almost six more than he had been averaging with Boston. 
Tisdale's shooting percentage has come down, but not greatly (48.5 percent from 
50 percent), and his scoring average is at 19 points, three above his Indiana 
totals.

UNSELD HAS BULLETS PLAYING HARD, AND WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm not afraid to admit it when I've made a mistake, having had some practice 
in that area. 
</P>
<P>
But I don't feel so bad on this occasion, because my mistake was about the 
Washington Bullets, who appreciate, as few can, a really good blunder. Give 
them a draft pick, and they'll squander it. Their good trades backfire; their 
bad ones couldn't get through airport security. 
</P>
<P>
And so, when I wrote last fall that the Bullets would win 22 games this season, 
I made the same kind of prediction the Bullets made when they suggested Muggsy 
Bogues would be an All-Star point guard. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out, of course, the Bullets could win 40 games. You try to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
They have no center, which is to say they have Charles Jones, one of the many 
Joneses, who is a backup power forward if he's in the league at all. Of course, 
he's far superior to Dave Feitl, the would-be Bullets center who came to town 
in the ill-fated (which is to say, dumb) trade for Manute Bol. 
</P>
<P>
Their power forward, Terry Catledge, is, like Jones, a backup power forward on 
a decent team. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Walker, the point guard, is having a spectacular season playing out of 
position. He is, on most teams, a shooting guard coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
How do you win without a true center or point guard? 
</P>
<P>
How do you win with John Williams, a real talent, who should be a small 
forward, playing big forward and center and even point guard? 
</P>
<P>
How do you win with a roster that has expansion team written all over it and 
win to the point where you might finish .500 and where you've played, in the 
second half of the season, among the upper third of the teams in the league? 
</P>
<P>
Well, there is Bernard King, of course, whose comeback is the stuff of legend. 
The King is dead, long live the King. He has been a leader, a go-to guy, a 
winner. He matters. 
</P>
<P>
And there is shooting guard Jeff Malone, who does just what a shooting guard is 
supposed to do, except better than most. 
</P>
<P>
But the real answer is not in the personnel, which hardly separates the Bullets 
from the San Antonios and the Clippers of the world. The answer is they play 
hard. They play hard on Tuesday nights in Indiana. They play hard before a home 
crowd against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
And the credit for that has to go to the coach, Wes Unseld. Who else? 
</P>
<P>
What I like about Unseld is he says he's still learning his job. He's not 
interested in being proclaimed a genius, only one who coaches as hard as he 
played. He believes in the work ethic, as does his star, King. Everyone has 
come to believe the same way. 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting league this season, which may be a watershed. Certainly, 
there are a number of Coach of the Year candidates. 
</P>
<P>
With a patchwork lineup not much better than the Bullets', Golden State, under 
Don Nelson, has had a winning season. Cotton Fitzsimmons, who was basically run 
out of San Antonio, has made a contender of Phoenix this season, one year after 
the Suns went 28-54. Adding Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson didn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the year, Cleveland had the best record in the league. The 
Cavaliers have talent, but Coach Lenny Wilkens had to help teach them how to 
win. But winning awards isn't as important as accomplishment, and Unseld has 
accomplished as much as any. 
</P>
<P>
What's different about this season is that the Boston Celtics, without Larry 
Bird, are fading in the East, and the Los Angeles Lakers, in Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar's last gasp, are struggling to stay atop the West. 
</P>
<P>
Before Isiah Thomas suffered a broken hand in a bad Mike Tyson imitation, I 
thought the Detroit Pistons were a cinch to win the NBA. Now, if the Pistons 
fall, it could be the Lakers, the Cavaliers, the Suns, the Jazz, maybe the 
Knicks. Never have there been more legitimate contenders. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be the Bullets, of course, for which they can be grateful. It would 
have been an especially cruel twist for this team to have so overachieved and 
then have to settle for another one-round appearance in the playoffs and a 
draft pick in the middle of the first round. By missing the playoffs, as now 
seems certain, they are in the lottery and in position to pick a player that 
can help them. 
</P>
<P>
This is the year. The Bullets' first-round pick next year belongs to Dallas, in 
exchange for Jay Vincent -- another in a series of great trades. Unfortunately, 
this does not look to be an exceptional year in the draft, and there's no sure 
bet on who is No. 1, although it could well be Danny Ferry, the son of Bullets 
General Manager Bob Ferry. That would be an interesting development. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets can ill afford to blow this one. Of course, they are on a roll, 
having hired Wes Unseld out of the front office, making him their vice 
president-coach. No one could say that wasn't a great decision. Of course, you 
could also say the Bullets were due.

YANKEES' DAVE RIGHETTI IS ON TRIAL ONCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Righetti's life has become a series of intertwining, frustrating Catch-22 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti was limited to seven innings of work in spring training because the 
New York Yankees wanted to make sure his arm was healthy for the start of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Righetti says, his arm feels fine but his strength is not what it should 
be. The result: three rough outings, a 21.00 ERA and a new spate of questions 
concerning his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti says all he needs is to pitch a lot to pitch better. But because he's 
pitching poorly, the Yankees are turning to others. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, who will never be confused with a defiant, shuck-off-failure stopper, 
needs to work in a peaceful vacuum to rediscover the magic that made him the 
game's most dominant reliever three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he works in situations where every minute detail of his struggles 
and-or successes is intensely scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
A perfectionist, Righetti is the reliever former Yankees coach Mark Connor once 
said took defeat harder than any pitcher he'd ever seen. And undoubtedly, 
Righetti's entry into 1989 is killing the left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the winter, you hope it (the negatives) all gets cleansed out," Righetti 
said. "But all it takes is one bad game to bring it back." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday he wore the excruciating pain on his face. That was the night Righetti 
was brought into a 6-6 game against the Toronto Blue Jays in the 10th inning 
moments after a two-run rally by the Yankees had forced extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti struck out the side. He also allowed hits to the first four Blue Jays 
he faced, a brutal lead-in to what became a five-run, six-hit inning and an 
11-6 Jays' victory that also was the Yankees' seventh straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Barfield, one of Righetti's strikeout victims, wondered aloud why the 
pitcher would throw an 0-and-2 changeup. That's baseball parlance for saying 
something's not right with a hard-throwing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Up in one of the Yankees' many television booths, 300-game 
winner-turned-commentator Tom Seaver also said Righetti didn't look like the 
pitcher who has saved 162 games for the Yankees since 1984. Seaver said 
Righetti looked like a guy with some arm troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to agree with Tom," said another former pitcher, Yankees Manager Dallas 
Green. But, Green said, he and Righetti have this deal, one struck in spring 
training: If Righetti is hurt, he has vowed to tell Green. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Dave's protecting anything," Green said. "I hope he's not. If 
his arm hurts, he's got to tell us. I haven't been led in any direction other 
than he's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti insists he's fine. Even after Tuesday's bashing, in which Righetti's 
pitches just seemed to hang enticingly in the Jays' pull zone rather than 
explode on by. He admits that in the past, the sore shoulder has led to a 
tender elbow. "Then, I was trying to protect the shoulder," he said. "But I'm 
healthy now." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti did not resent Seaver's comments. He said it was a compliment that 
such a pitcher expected better of him. "But that's the problem," Righetti said. 
"Just because you get your butt kicked doesn't mean anything's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good. I have no excuses." 
</P>
<P>
For Righetti, that refrain is becoming familiar. It's one he's had to turn to 
with alarming frequency the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti blew nine saves in 1988, 13 the year before and 10 in 1986, when he 
saved a record 46 games. Righetti saved only 25 games in 1988. He also lost 
four games. The league hit .257 against Righetti in 1988, down slightly from 
the .262 of 1987, but still drastically worse than the .226 in Righetti's 
record-setting season of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The falloff increases the doubts with every poor outing. That, in itself, takes 
a toll. Righetti admits he's trying to find the middle ground emotionally, 
trying to find the groove physically to end the constant reassessment of his 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
So, three games into the 1989 season, Righetti is in that white hot spotlight 
again: his fans, his team, wondering what's wrong with him. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Green needed a stopper, but he could not turn to Righetti, who had 
faced 10 batters Tuesday. Instead, Green used Lee Guetterman, who saved the 5-3 
victory over the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Righetti were rested, the save situation might not have been his. Green 
says he might temporarily move the pitcher to middle innings. There's more work 
to be found there. Less pressure, too. 
</P>
<P>
So Righetti must wait and wonder if and when prime time will be his time again. 
And he must wait to see if the Yankees believe him when he says he's only 
rusty. Green does right now. But Green also knows Righetti has been known to 
suffer pain in silence rather than offer excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about that," Green said. "That's something Dave would have to 
live with. I've told him how I feel. That's all I can do."

THE PROBLEM WITH STARTING AT THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN WALKER, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Morgan and David Clyde know what Jim Abbott is going through. They, too, 
started at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be the greatest pitcher who ever lived," Clyde said. "I don't 
regret anything, but things didn't turn out the way I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Abbott became the 10th pitcher since 1965 to make his 
professional debut in the major leagues. The other nine all dropped down into 
the minors and only Burt Hooton finished his career with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how to lose right out of high school," said Morgan, who lost his 
first nine starts. "I was 18 years old and raw, and it killed me. It didn't 
kill me as a person, but it killed my career." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde and Morgan, now with the Los Angeles Dodgers, at least made it back to 
the majors for awhile. So did Dick Ruthven, Steve Dunning, Tim Conroy and Pete 
Broberg. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Bane and Mike Adamson didn't even do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't ready at all to come to the big leagues as far as pitching," said 
Ruthven, who went from Fresno State to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Ruthven, now a home builder in Atlanta, was 6-9 as a rookie. He finished 
123-127 in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud that I made it, but now I think I would've preferred to go to 
the minor leagues to start. I was a thrower, and the harder I threw it, the 
harder they hit it," he said. "Jim Abbott seems like he's more of a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott struggled in his debut Saturday night for the California Angels. He lost 
to Seattle, giving up three earned runs in 4 2-3 innings. He was scheduled to 
pitch again Thursday against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Five position players have directly gone to the majors since 1965, the first 
year of the draft system. As a rule, they've done well with Dave Winfield, Bob 
Horner and Pete Incaviglia never going back to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I needed to go there," Incaviglia said. "I'm doing OK with the 
Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Roberts, who began with San Diego in 1972, and Brian Milner, who played 
two games for Toronto in 1978, also began in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if going to the minor leagues for a couple of years would have 
made a difference," Broberg, an attorney in Florida, said. "At the time, I 
wanted nothing more than to go straight from college to the big leagues. I 
thought I could step up, and I thought I did all right for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Broberg left Dartmouth in 1971 and was 5-9 with a 3.46 earned run average as a 
rookie for Washington. He went to the minors two years later and finished in 
1978 with a 41-71 record. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning, a star at Stanford, won his debut with Cleveland in 1969 but wound up 
4-9. His career record was 23-41. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it made an impact on me one way or the other," said Dunning, a 
lawyer in California. "My problem was I never developed a quality breaking 
pitch to go with my fastball. The opportunity was there in the majors to learn 
it, but I never did." 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, Jim Abbott is like I was," he said. "He's got a good fastball and 
needs to work on his breaking pitch. But there are benefits of being in the 
majors. You have a pitching coach, teammates and the opposing pitchers to learn 
from." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde and Morgan had it harder when they ascended from high school to the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde had an amazing prep career in Texas and won his debut for the Rangers in 
1973 at age 18. But he went 4-8 that season and was 18-33 when he stopped six 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back on it, they probably should have sent me to the rookie league and 
let me get the feel of being a professional with people my own age," Clyde said 
from Houston, where works at a lumberyard. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, a lot of people said my father pushed me into the major leagues 
and nothing could be further from the truth," he said. "I thought I was ready. 
My biggest drawback was I felt I had to be better than I was." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde was sent to the minors for the first time in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I could finally work on some things and get away 
from all the hoopla." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was one week removed from high school in Las Vegas when he debuted for 
Oakland in 1978. Conroy started with the Athletics the same year. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how to lose right out of high school, not how to win," Morgan said. 
"I lost my pride and my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
"You're 2-13 and still a kid and you should be pitching in rookie ball or Class 
A," he said. "The 'L's were piling up. No 'W's were piling up." 
</P>
<P>
Bane, a star at Arizona State, went 0-5 for Minnesota in 1973 and was out of 
baseball by 1977. Adamson left the University of Southern California to play 
for Baltimore in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"My first warmup pitch landed on the screen over the backstop. So did my second 
one," Adamson recalled from Moorpark, Calif. "I was telling myself to stay 
under control, but it was hard to do. You want to be in the show so bad." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Jim Abbott is doing the same thing. You squeeze the ball too hard and 
you overthrow," he said. "It's such an emotional headtrip."

CATCHING CAPITALS' FEVER IS DEPRESSING

<P>
How many replays are we going to have to see? How many times are we going to 
have to watch Ron Hextall flip the bloody puck into the air and follow it 
sliding down the ice into the Capitals' empty net? How many times are we going 
to have to listen to some bonehead gleefully exclaim that in the whole history 
of the NHL playoffs -- all 10,000 games' worth -- this was THE FIRST GOAL EVER 
BY A GOALIE!! 
</P>
<P>
I got up early Wednesday morning, turned on the TV and, no matter where I went, 
I couldn't get away from the replay. I saw it on 4, 5, 7, 9, 20, 50, CNN, TNT 
and ESPN. I saw it on the Weather Channel, superimposed on a precipitation 
chart. On MTV, they interrupted (thankfully) a Metallica video to show it. On 
"Bravo", there were narrations in Swedish and Spanish. On "Nickelodeon", they 
went straight from the replay into a shot of Mr. Ed laughing. If they could 
show it on all-news radio, we'd get it every half hour. 
</P>
<P>
Enough already. 
</P>
<P>
(What the hell was Hextall doing with such a curved stick, anyway? Shouldn't 
they have measured that curve? What's that, the Kim Basinger model? That should 
have been a penalty.) 
</P>
<P>
I'm depressed. 
</P>
<P>
It's beyond anger. I feel a dark, damp, gloomy sadness hanging over me -- sort 
of like being in Seattle. Or being Scott Hoch's caddie. 
</P>
<P>
What's red, white and blue and plays golf in April? 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
They do it to me every spring; they never fail. First, the forsythia blast out, 
then the tulips, then the Capitals. I feel like Charlie Brown just as Lucy 
yanks the football away. Why do I continually fall for this? 
</P>
<P>
Hextall! 
</P>
<P>
Of all people, why did it have to be Hextall? 
</P>
<P>
Did you see him exulting after the goal? Tell me you didn't want to pop him in 
the labonza. Bang, zoom, Hextall! 
</P>
<P>
Three different people telephoned me in the third period, between the time 
Pelle Eklund scored to give Philly a 6-5 lead, and it ended. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you watching this? Are you watching?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course I was watching. At least I watched until Hextall scored. Then, I 
stuck my head in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
It's a disease. It has to be a disease. It doesn't matter who they bring in 
here. You can be the greatest player in the world, you could be Gretzky, but as 
soon as you put on the Capitals' uniform, you lose in the playoffs. Caps Fever: 
Catch It, and Gag. 
</P>
<P>
I moped all day Wednesday. Even the things that normally cheer me up, like 
wondering how many doughnuts Don Koharski ate for dinner, didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
How could they lose that game? One thing I definitely don't want to hear is how 
Hextall "came up large in the goal." I've heard this same phrase applied to 
Billy Smith, John Vanbiesbrouck, Kelly Hrudey and Sean Burke. (I visualize Gump 
Worsley coming back the size of a Thanksgiving Day float and shutting out the 
Capitals 18 straight times.) With them, it was true. But the Capitals got five 
goals off Hextall. Five should be enough to win. This is hockey; five'll win 
baseball games, for gosh sake. Hextall came up small. Peeters, however, came up 
leaky. 
</P>
<P>
I was all set for the Penguins. I was primed to see Mario Lemieux and Paul 
Coffey. I'd learned how spell Ubriaco, which until last week I thought was the 
second word in the German anthem. (They're not saying, "Boo," they're chanting, 
"Igloo.") Not that I'd bought nonrefundable plane tickets to Pittsburgh, mind 
you. I wasn't stupid, I realized these were the Capitals I was planning around, 
the accidental tourists of the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose if the Capitals lose Thursday night in Philadelphia, it'll be the end 
of the Bryan Murray Era. That's too bad, because I like Murray. Everyone seems 
to. Maybe they could hire a coach like Murray. Maybe his brother, Terry. At 
least a coach named Murray: 
</P>
<P>
Eddie. 
</P>
<P>
Bill. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
Ann. (Spread your tiny wings and blah-blah-blah. She should actually be the 
front-runner; she's Canadian.) 
</P>
<P>
Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
Walter. Nah, he'd hold out; the Capitals would have to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
Fred MacMurray. Murray, the cop from "The Odd Couple." Murry from Murry's 
Steaks. F. Murray Abraham. Murray Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Not one of those young, screaming maniacs, though. Why does everyone think that 
all the Capitals need is an ornery mule who'll kick their behinds? Fine, get 
Francis. (Not Emile, hosehead, the one who worked with Donald O'Connor.) 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what more to say to my friends on the Capitals. I've done my best. 
I've tried every trick in the book to motivate you. The first time I called you 
choking dogs, it worked; you won. But the next time, you lost -- choking like 
dogs, I might add. When I reversed that and called your opponents choking dogs, 
you still lost. Why do you always lose in the playoffs? Why can't you ever get 
out of your division? What is it, a visa deal? The last person who was as tied 
down was Gulliver. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't hurt me anymore, not after this Hextall Fiasco. I'm washing my 
hands of you. You're on your own.

U. S. FACES FIRST TEST IN COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From The Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
After 39 years of failure, the United States has its best chance yet of 
qualifying for soccer's World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
Strong recent performances have made the Americans a favorite to be one of the 
two teams from the Central and North American and Caribbean region (CONCACAF) 
to advance to the tournament in Italy next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"In our neck of the woods, we've achieved parity," U.S. national team Coach Bob 
Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
With Mexico barred from international competition for two years for using 
over-age players in qualifying for the Under-20 world championships, and Canada 
already eliminated, two of the United States' major adversaries in the region 
have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, no one is taking anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a favorite (in the region)," Gansler said. "If anybody 
feels this is going to be a cakewalk, they are sadly mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. opens its final-round schedule of eight home-and-home matches today at 
San Jose, Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
It will play the return match against Costa Rica on April 30 in the St. Louis 
suburb of Fenton, Mo., and play host to Trinidad &amp; Tobago on May 13 at El 
Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the U.S. plays Guatemala in New Britain, Conn. on June 10. It plays in El 
Salvador on July 9 and in Guatemala on Oct. 8. The final two games will be 
played at yet to be determined U.S. sites against El Salvador on Nov. 5 and in 
Trinidad &amp; Tobago on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans last played in the World Cup in 1950 -- when participation was by 
invitation. Since then, they have failed to qualify in nine consecutive 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
After a successful Olympic qualifying performance, an encouraging Olympic 
showing, a third-place finish in the world indoor championships in the 
Netherlands in January and a surprisingly strong, fourth-place finish in the 
Under-20 world championships in Saudi Arabia in February, a new confident 
attitude seems to have developed on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
"To put us in the World Cup will make us a legitimate host to the 1994 World 
Cup," said 24-year-old forward Brent Goulet. "For the players who stuck out it 
out in soccer when there really was nowhere for them to play in this country . 
. . for all these players, for us to keep their dream alive is so important." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the U.S. team believes it can fulfill those dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the qualifying effort that we had back for the 1982 World 
Cup, it was different than we have right now," said Rick Davis, midfielder and 
captain of the U.S. team for the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a group with Canada and Mexico. When we went down to Mexico, the 
attitude on the team was 'Well let's try to keep it as close as possible.' 
Whereas when we went down to El Salvador last year as part of the Olympic 
qualifying it was: 'Hey, let's see if we can't really run this score up.' 
</P>
<P>
"The overall attitude is completely different." 
</P>
<P>
Self-confidence was firmly installed during the indoor championships in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"What we got out of the indoor championships is that they're human and that we 
have the skill," Goulet said. "We can beat those teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Just having a winning attitude (is important). We learn by winning. We don't 
go out and just compete. We want to win." 
</P>
<P>
The team has been able to maintain this positive attitude and maintain 
continuity by placing more than a dozen players under contract. This keeps the 
players together and has allowed the team to develop a rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet, Hugo Perez, Bruce Murray and Peter Vermes consistently have made up the 
offensive threat over the last two years. Davis has anchored a midfield with 
Tab Ramos, John Harkes and Jim Gabarra, and Mike Windischmann has formed the 
base of the defense with Paul Caligiuri and Brian Bliss. 
</P>
<P>
David Vanole has been the No. 1 goalkeeper over the past two years but now has 
yielded that role to his backup during that time, Jeff Duback. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the final qualifying round, the United States has played 
well: a 2-0 record on a South American tour in March and a second-place finish 
last weekend to Colombia's Santa Fe in the Marlboro Cup of Miami, where it lost 
the championship game on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
The players Gansler has are mostly young, about half the squad is under 
25-years-old. 
</P>
<P>
The two most internationally experienced players are Davis and Windischmann. 
Davis, the most experienced with more than 40 appearances for the U.S. in 
international competition, may miss time due to torn cartilage in his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the mix of youth and experience has helped the United States, but the 
loss of Davis may upset that balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick's there as a stabilizer, more or less, because he's been through more 
international games than anybody," said the 24-year-old Bliss. "Mike 
(Windischmann) would probably pick up that (leadership) responsibility. We lose 
a little bit there as far as Rick's ability to keep the players calm when we're 
under pressure because he's gone through that stuff before."

IN HIS DAY, SUGAR RAY WAS KING OF BIG APPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emile Griffith fought more main events there, and Beau Jack holds the record 
for selling out the house three times in a month. But when it comes to sweet 
memories, no fighter provided more to Madison Square Garden's old-timers than 
Sugar Ray Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"He was Mr. New York as far as boxing, and maybe as far as everything," said 
John Condon, former Garden publicist and matchmaker. "He was mobbed when he 
walked down the streets. Everybody knew him." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who died at 67 Wednesday in a hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of 
Culver City, was an adopted New Yorker who became a local institution. 
</P>
<P>
With his home on Sugar Hill, the affluent Harlem neighborhood, his bar, Sugar 
Ray's, and his pink Cadillac convertible, which was apt to be parked, but never 
ticketed, on any street corner in town, Sugar Ray turned the Big Apple into the 
Candy Apple. 
</P>
<P>
"He would leave that car anywhere, even the middle of Times Square, for hours 
on end, and no one would touch it," Condon said. "Sometimes he would park it 
right in front of the old Garden and come to negotiate a deal. When he would go 
down, three or four hours later, he'd find the police guarding the car for him. 
Nobody would ever think of giving him a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
And his special home was Madison Square Garden, where he fought 21 main events, 
including some of his best and worst. Among Robinson's Garden highlights were 
his welterweight-title winning decision over Tommy Bell in 1946; the first and 
fourth of his six wars with Jake LaMotta, and his memorable non-title meeting 
with Henry Armstrong in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
Among the lowlights were Robinson's loss of his middleweight title to Gene 
Fullmer in 1957, and his final fight in New York, a decision loss to Denny 
Moyer in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Robinson headlined four Garden-promoted shows in the city's 
ballparks, including his 10th-round KO over Randy Turpin at the Polo Grounds to 
regain the middleweight crown in 1951, his dramatic 14th-round TKO loss to Joey 
Maxim at Yankee Stadium in a bid for Maxim's light-heavyweight crown and his 
15-round loss to Carmen Basilio at Yankee Stadium that cost him the 
middleweight title in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The Turpin fight, in which a badly cut Robinson was given one more round by 
referee Ruby Goldstein and responded by knocking out Turpin, drew more than 
60,000 fans and attracted a record live gate for middleweights. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullmer fight was an example of Robinson's drawing power in New York. The 
fight had originally been scheduled for December, but an injury to Robinson had 
postponed the bout, and the only open date turned out to be Jan. 2, 
traditionally a terrible day for live events. So how did the fight do? 
</P>
<P>
"We sold out the house, 18,000 seats," Teddy Brenner, the matchmaker at the 
time, said. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss to Moyer, Robinson got some advice from Brenner's boss, Harry 
Markson, the president of Garden boxing. Markson had worked with Robinson 
throughout his career. "I didn't like his performance at all against Moyer," 
Markson said. "I told him I would never use him again in the Garden because I 
preferred to remember him as the great fighter he was. He was very upset at the 
time, but years later he came to me and thanked me. He said I had done the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson fought 41 times after Markson's edict, but never again in New York. 
Even after he retired, however, Condon recalled how Robinson could still fill 
the Garden with his presence. 
</P>
<P>
Emile Griffith was defending his middleweight title against Manuel Gonzalez on 
Dec. 10, 1965, a month after Robinson had lost to Joey Archer in what would be 
his last fight, and ticket sales were slow. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said to Harry Markson, let's put on a farewell to Ray Robinson," Condon 
said. "I brought in the five guys he had beat for his middleweight titles, even 
Randy Turpin came in from London. It was nothing more than Ray Robinson walking 
into the ring, and we filled the place with it. Without him, the show would 
have been a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Brenner, who stayed in contact with Robinson in his later years, was saddened 
by the deterioration in Sugar Ray, a victim of Alzheimer's disease, over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1985 Marvin Hagler-Thomas Hearns fight, one of the richest middleweight 
title fights of all time, Robinson pointed to Hagler and asked Brenner, "Did I 
ever fight him?" 
</P>
<P>
Hagler and Robinson never fought, of course, but Markson believes that if Sugar 
Ray Robinson were in his prime today, he would far outdistance the current crop 
of middleweights in terms of drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
"I had offered him $500,000 for a third fight with Carmen Basilio, which was a 
huge amount in those days, but Ray turned it down, saying he could get more 
money," Markson said. "It never panned out and he wound up fighting Paul Pender 
for $50,000 and got beat. But if Robinson and Basilio were in their prime and 
we did that fight today, it would double anything that Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Marvin Hagler ever got."

SUGAR RAY'S LEGEND LARGER THAN LIFE, OR DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sugar Ray Robinson was the first fighter I ever heard of. He was fighting Gene 
Fullmer, and as we sat down to watch the bout on television, my father, a 
Robinson devotee, explained to me that Sugar Ray was the best fighter, pound 
for pound, who ever laced up a glove. 
</P>
<P>
I believed him, of course. He was my father. He knew everything, or so he 
assured me. 
</P>
<P>
My father told me many things. He told me Ted Williams was the best hitter 
ever, that Willie Mays was the best player ever, but that Duke Snider, because 
we were Dodger fans, was our favorite player ever, and we were never to admit 
to anyone outside the home that Mays might actually be better than the Duke. 
</P>
<P>
These bits of wisdom weren't lectures. They were pieces of daily conversation 
that I was expected to absorb. I had no choice, because I would later be 
quizzed. That's the kind of family I grew up in. 
</P>
<P>
He told me Johnny Unitas was the best quarterback, Jimmy Brown the best running 
back, Oscar Robertson the best basketball player, FDR the best president, 
Hemingway the best writer, Bogey the best actor, Benny Goodman (pound for 
pound) the best clarinetist. 
</P>
<P>
As a kid, I thought special knowledge was being passed on to me, a secret that 
no one else knew. When my grandfather would visit, he would tell me how Ty Cobb 
slid with spikes high or how Babe Ruth pointed to center field or how Dempsey 
was the best unless it was Jack Johnson, and I felt as if I was there, too. 
</P>
<P>
When I grew a little older and a little wiser (actually, a little more of a 
wise guy), I started drawing my own conclusions, and if they conflicted with 
the older generation's, so much the better. Any of you who were once teen-agers 
understand what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
Mine was the era of anti-heroes. I liked players with floppy socks and big 
Afros and whatever else made the over-thirtysomethings nervous. And yet, the 
names and images stayed with me. Sugar Ray. Duke. Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
They were the sainted ones in a religion I couldn't ever quite give up. And 
when I wonder sometimes about the near-universal appeal of sports, I put it 
down to religion and to collective knowledge and to fathers and sons, and, now 
especially, fathers and daughters, too. 
</P>
<P>
And so, whatever I know of the original Sugar Ray is how I imagine him. I see 
him as slick and fast and with hands that held lightning. When I hear stories 
of punches that came in blurred flurries, it's as if I actually saw them, 
remember them, drew pleasure from them and not just from some scratchy film 
where the fighters all seem small and slow and not quite real. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson became real to me through Muhammad Ali, who saw in Robinson everything 
he wanted to be. Ali was my hero, as he was for many of my friends. 
</P>
<P>
He was young and brash and cocky and proud and a rebel, who made a fool of his 
opponents, who laughed at them. He said he was better than Marciano, better 
than Louis, the greatest. But he never said he was better than Sugar Ray, whom 
he called his master. 
</P>
<P>
Ali stole Robinson's style and embellished it, much as Sugar Ray Leonard stole 
Ali's imitation of Sugar Ray Robinson and stole the name, too. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Robinson is dead, at age 67. The sportswriters would say he went down for 
the count, which may not be the way you want your passing to be described, but 
it's all right. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Robinson the real person doesn't, in the final analysis, matter nearly as 
much as Sugar Ray the legend. His real-life story, with all the attendant 
tragedies, is a story told a million times. He was bigger than life, as the 
front-page obits in newspapers across America attest. And now, he's bigger than 
death, too. 
</P>
<P>
When the tragedies that may yet befall Pete Rose are listed, the one that 
somehow strikes the saddest chord to many is not a life ruined but that he 
could be eliminated for consideration for the Hall of Fame, taken down from the 
list of legends, removed from the baseball pantheon. Is death any worse? Is it 
any different? 
</P>
<P>
Somebody once said there are no heroes close up, and I'm sure that's true. It's 
harder to be a hero today because so little is private anymore, and we know our 
heroes much too well. And yet, though the sports pages are filled with scandal 
and tragedy, the stadiums and arenas are still filled with people, more now 
than ever. There's a message there, which leads me to suspect that the heroes 
of today will somehow survive this close inspection, even as the Greek heroes 
did. And, as of old, fathers will tell their children, and those children their 
children.

NEIGHBORHOODS BY THE NUMBERS: HOW ZIP CODES CAN PIGEONHOLE PEOPLE LIKE WIDGETS 
IN A DIGIT FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And you thought you were unique. 
</P>
<P>
You may mention tangibles like your fingerprints. You've never seen any others 
like them. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps your identity rests with the psyche. Who else could have dreamed 
what you did last night? 
</P>
<P>
Well, wake up, America. It's time you knew. 
</P>
<P>
For years now, the federal government has had your number. Fact is, the 
government actually assigned you your number. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to your soul? Contemplate your ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know, for example, that residents of 91108, otherwise known as San 
Marino, are four times more likely than the average American to use an American 
Express card, buy a new convertible and spend lots of money on custom-made 
draperies? 
</P>
<P>
Or that those who live in 92629, a.k.a. Dana Point, are not into bowling, 
menthol cigarettes and clipping coupons? 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe the system isn't fail-proof. Even those living in the same 
household, let alone the same ZIP code, have been known to disagree about a few 
things. 
</P>
<P>
But geo-demographics, the blending of geography and demography, has 
revolutionized the way thousands of organizations -- advertisers, political 
groups, media and financial institutions among them -- look at the nation. 
</P>
<P>
That's why residents of one ZIP code are offered a pre-approved credit card and 
others are not, why your neighbor just down the block -- but in a different ZIP 
code -- may pay more than you for the same automobile insurance policy and why 
your mailbox is stuffed with coupons for pizza and your friend's with offers to 
subscribe to Smithsonian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mass Market Myth 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the mass market is a myth. Instead, think of a nation of 40 
"clusters" -- with catchy names like Furs &amp; Stationwagons, Shotguns &amp; 
Pickups, Young Influentials and Bohemian Mix -- and then connect them to the 
nation's 42,396 ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
That's what social scientist-turned-entrepreneur Jonathan Robbin did back in 
1974 with his Claritas Cluster System, feeding esoteric data from the U.S. 
Census and other sources into a computer and then pigeonholing Americans into 
"life style segments" ranked according to a "ZIP Quality" scale of affluence. 
</P>
<P>
ZIP codes classified as Blue Blood Estates, for example, have a ZIP Quality 
rank of 1, while Public Assistance is at the bottom with 40. But income isn't 
all that the constantly updated Claritas system -- and others that have sprung 
up since -- is concerned with. 
</P>
<P>
Working from the assumption that people tend to live near others who are like 
them, a ZIP code, the theory goes, can classify people according to their 
tastes in everything from politics, to religion to mustard. 
</P>
<P>
"If you tell me your ZIP code," Robbin said from his office in Alexandria, Va., 
"I can predict what you eat, drink, drive -- even think." 
</P>
<P>
Journalist Michael J. Weiss, author of "The Clustering of America," an 
exhaustive look at the Claritas system and its implications, believes 
clustering is the most insightful way to categorize American diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the same cluster have similar habits, backgrounds and values. It is 
my contention that in America, we really speak 40 different languages in terms 
of what we buy, what we read and what we think about." 
</P>
<P>
Not that this bit of news always goes over big with the clusterees. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think of myself as atypical," said one indignant matron outside her 
Tudor style residence in ZIP code 90077, which you may know as Bel-Air, but 
which the Claritas computer software calls 100% Blue Blood Estates. "What makes 
me atypical? I'm better." 
</P>
<P>
But yes, she conceded, she fits the profile. She played tennis more than 10 
times last year, she travels abroad, she's health-conscious, she charges big on 
her American Express Card, drinks imported wine and has more than two phone 
lines to connect her to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, according to her ZIP profile, she is not very likely to buy a car 
battery at a car parts store, to be a fan of professional wrestling or to drink 
inordinate amounts of cola drinks. 
</P>
<P>
And surely, she is asked, she doesn't own a pickup truck? 
</P>
<P>
"Um, well, at the vineyard we do." 
</P>
<P>
But putting that little glitch aside, a tour through 90077 -- and even an 
occasional chat with its elusive residents -- reveals it to be quintessential 
Blue Blood Estates, a cluster to which only 0.59% of U.S. households belong. 
</P>
<P>
Residents here do not hang out by the fence together, nor organize many block 
parties. At the end of a dead end street, instead of empty beer cans a visitor 
found a drained bottle of vintage Pouilly Fuisse that had yet to be cleared 
away by a cleaning crew. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is about as unneighborly as it gets," said another 90077 resident 
caught off guard in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"I could stand here and be killed and the guy up there wouldn't care," he said 
with a sweep of his arm toward a neighboring manicured estate. "People here 
have no interest in each other. They are too important for that, or they think 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
Not too many surprises here, either. This retired businessman says he likes 
classical music, subscribes to two newspapers and three business publications, 
watches public television and always votes Republican. He's fired up about 
taxes -- there are too many of them -- and government interference in general. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick of giving money away," he said, "and of all these bleeding hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Bel-Air is just one of several Blue Blood Estates nationwide (others 
can be found in Lake Forest, Ill., Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Scarsdale, 
N.Y., to name a few) and that label describes 2.5% of all the households in Los 
Angeles County, in various ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 1.3% of the households are Blue Blood (most of ZIP code 92705 
in North Tustin fits that description) and in San Diego County, the Blue Blood 
percentage is 0.42, including all of Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Claritas ("clarity" in Latin) system is that residents of any 
given cluster -- whether they happen to live in Idaho, or Maine, or wherever -- 
will have more in common with other members of that cluster than with anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the system contend, for example, that a Californian might more 
accurately describe himself vis-a-vis his cluster than his state. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as the California life style," Weiss said. "That's 
baloney. Tell me how the California life style explains Watts and Beverly Hills 
within a few miles of each other?" 
</P>
<P>
So instead of just asking "Where are you from?" a cluster analysis might ask, 
"What do you buy? What do you eat? And what do you read?" Claritas believes 
that the answers to these and a slew of other questions better define the 
essence of who we are. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go to sleep in Palo Alto and wake up in Princeton, N.J., and except 
for the palm trees, the life styles are identical," said Weiss, speaking of two 
communities that fit into the Money &amp; Brains cluster, also the dominant 
cluster in ZIPs 91604 in Studio City, 90290 in Topanga, 92625 in Corona del Mar 
and 92663 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moderate Republicans 
</P>
<P>
Live in a Money &amp; Brains cluster -- 4% of the households in Los Angeles 
County, 8% in Orange County and 2.9% in San Diego -- and you are likely to be a 
moderate Republican, read magazines like Forbes and Gourmet, drive an expensive 
foreign car like a Jaguar or a Mercedes and turn up your nose at canned meat 
spreads and presweetened cold cereal. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the largest percentage of Americans -- still only 6.26% of all U.S. 
households -- live in a New Homesteaders cluster. But in Southern California, 
it's New Beginnings -- one of eight new clusters that evolved after the 1980 
census -- that's dominant. 
</P>
<P>
(In Los Angeles County, 13.5% of households fall into this group, while in 
Orange and San Diego, the percentages are 19.3 and 21.) 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Harris, a 47-year-old machinist and father of seven, doesn't fit too 
neatly into this cluster-known for sheltering a high percentage of divorced 
Americans -- but then again, he is not altogether atypical. 
</P>
<P>
Walking down the street of his Hawthorne neighborhood, ZIP 90250, he explained 
that his move three weeks ago from South-Central Los Angeles into a four 
bedroom, two bath apartment represents a whole new life for him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"The area is better," he said, "I haven't seen any gang violence yet. My kids 
go to better schools here. . . . I want my family to have the best. I want my 
kids to have a college education." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Renters 
</P>
<P>
Residents of New Beginnings, according to Claritas, are 1.6 times more likely 
than the average American to have rented a home in the past year, almost twice 
as likely to have bought New Wave music, 1.5 times as likely to belong to a 
health club and 1.3 times more likely to use a gas credit card. Not too many of 
them own gas chain saws, eat at ice cream restaurants or belong to religious 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, for the record, rents his apartment, has been married for 22 years, 
lifts weights and jogs. He votes Democratic -- while most New Beginners 
nationwide voted for Ronald Reagan -- and watches the Bill Cosby and Oprah 
Winfrey shows. 
</P>
<P>
And talking cluster profiles here, Harris' Hawthorne neighborhood is as 
eclectic as he is. Although 64.7% of ZIP 90250 is New Beginnings, another 12.7% 
comes up as Pools &amp; Patios, with single digit percentages for Rank &amp; 
File, New Melting Pot, Single City Blues, Smalltown Downtown, Heavy Industry, 
Hispanic Mix and Levittown, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris' neighbor Lucilia Baron, in Spanish: "Everything I do is in 
Spanish, and our neighbors are Asians, who speak their own language, so we 
don't talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
And walking on the next street over, 90250 resident Julia Aghazaden, an 
immigrant from the Dominican Republic married to an Iranian immigrant, had this 
reflection on her neighborhood, "What I like about it is you can go outside and 
nobody comes to pick on you." 
</P>
<P>
Taken by themselves, such opinions and observations might be mildly interesting 
to, say, a social anthropologist, but once they are fed into a computer they 
can become grist for everything from political campaign strategies to a 
multimillion dollar advertising blitz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cluster Analysis 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a cluster analysis of a ZIP code (nationwide roughly 2,320 
households each), or even more exact, a cluster analysis at the Census block 
level (roughly 340 households each), an advertiser can determine if there is a 
market for almost anything. Some companies, Claritas not among them, even 
profile individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is meaningful for advertisers to know as much about the customer as they 
can," said Freedman Gosden Jr., chairman of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding/Direct 
Marketing Worldwide. "That way they can only spend money to mail to the same 
profile (of people) as the ones who are already responding." 
</P>
<P>
Some of this, to be sure, is just common sense. Gosden recalls that several 
years ago, a fund-raising drive for a major Los Angeles museum met with great 
success by using a mailing list of Brooks Brothers customers to solicit 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
Such targeting "always seems logical after the fact," he said, "but it is 
almost never logical before the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Author Weiss gives this example: "There's a company called Adam and Eve, which 
has an erotic novelty catalogue. They wanted to find out what neighborhood type 
was buying their products. Well, common sense would tell you that the people 
who would buy were Bohemian Mix, singles, funky urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"But lo and behold, they did a cluster analysis of who had bought their 
products in the past, and the highest percentage came from Money &amp; Brains. 
. . . It turns out that the people who live in Money &amp; Brains are not only 
buying Jaguars, sailboats and compact disc players, but they are also buying 
strawberry love oil." 
</P>
<P>
But while such tools as cluster analysis have been a boon to direct mail 
marketers -- on the average increasing their return from the 1%-2% range to the 
3%-5% -- that still means that the other 95% of us aren't jumping at the bait. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have found is that we can make people jump and flinch, but we can't 
make them buy things that they don't want to buy," said Ben Enis, a marketing 
professor at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Magic Answer' 
</P>
<P>
"There is no magic answer that is going to pop out," he said. "The ZIP code 
thing is one part of the puzzle at best." 
</P>
<P>
So what is it that makes us tick? 
</P>
<P>
Philosophers, sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, politicians and 
just about everybody else has their own answer to that one. And predictably 
enough, debate rages among marketers as well. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Flesch, director of the Values and Lifestyles Program at SRI 
International, an independent research organization in Menlo Park, says that 
while demographics are valuable in market research, a better approach would be 
grounded in psychology. VALS-2, SRI International's marketing system, puts 
consumers into one of eight psychological categories. 
</P>
<P>
According to the VALS-2 system, an action-oriented person might be more likely 
to buy coffee if it were shown being sipped at the ski lodge, whereas others 
might respond better to an authority figure like Mrs. Olson or Marcus Welby 
telling them which brew is 
</P>
<P>
best. 
</P>
<P>
"In an ideal world, you would use both geo-demographics and psycho-graphics," 
Flesch said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Claritas system, while heavily weighted by Census data, also uses 
behavioral studies to help gauge the pulse of America. And although the 1990 
Census is expected to register demographic changes in 20% of the nation's 
neighborhoods -- which Claritas says could mean eight new clusters and the 
demise of others -- Robbin, the system's founder, says that geo-demography 
remains a very stable system. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that neighborhoods, by and large, maintain themselves through a 
political infrastructure and are slow to change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telltale Data 
</P>
<P>
But when that does happen -- say, when farmland is subdivided and young 
suburbanites begin arriving to stake swing sets in their back yards -- telltale 
data start leaking out. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the R. L. Polk data base of auto registration," Robbin said. "We suddenly 
see all these expensive cars in the area. So now we see that the place has gone 
from farmland to Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We look for (such) exceptions, and then we investigate," he added, suddenly 
recalling an "oddball ZIP code" that recently caught his attention. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that Plainsboro, N.J., ZIP code 08536, is what Robbin calls the 
"richest, youngest and most single ZIP code in the country." 
</P>
<P>
"These people are really technocrats, young executives, who have banded 
together. This is the quintessential yuppie town. Almost half of its people are 
aged 25 to 34, which is almost double the national average, and it's not small. 
There are some 10,000 people, 6,000 households, yet half of the people live in 
single person households and the median income is $40,000." 
</P>
<P>
Robbin, a Bethesda, Md., Blue Blood Estates resident, who, incidentally, is 
leaving Claritas to consult, "develop some products, take some risks and spend 
time doing some outlandish things," describes himself as a social science data 
manipulator. 
</P>
<P>
Give him a Census survey, laden with such nuggets as a person's age, sex, race, 
income, marital status, etc., and he can construct an equation that will 
predict how that person will act. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never come across anything that wasn't predictable by one or more of 
these variables," he said. "The idea (behind the Claritas system) is that the 
fundamental variables described by the Census really relate to behavior in a 
fundamental way." 
</P>
<P>
So could that really mean that Furs &amp; Stationwagons are the raison d'etre 
of those who live within the boundaries of Northridge ZIP code 91311? 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Kathy Radaich, 39, mother of three and stepmother of another three, 
had to say: "My responsibility is to bring up the best kids that I can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drives a Jaguar 
</P>
<P>
And, in the meantime, she said from her elegantly furnished living room, she 
goes to the grocery store every day, reads scads of magazines, drives a Jaguar 
(she just sold her station wagon), exercises regularly, vacations in the 
Caribbean, votes Republican and watches television with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, she conceded, about the only glaring mismatch with her ZIP's cluster 
profile is her failure to drive a car leased by her or her husband's employer, 
or that she did not spend more than $25 at Best last month. 
</P>
<P>
But in Inglewood's Morningside Park, which Claritas describes as 76.68% Black 
Enterprise, 16.6% Emergent Minorities and 6.71% New Melting Pot, Dorothy 
Stallings seems to be in conflict with her cluster. 
</P>
<P>
True, she said while standing next to her red Mercedes, she is on the way up. 
She is 41 years old, a flight attendant, a single parent, and a health club 
devotee. But, no, she says, she doesn't drink Scotch, or malt liquor or eat at 
too many theme restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
And just like that matron in Bel-Air, Stallings said the idea that she is 
classified by her ZIP code, in this case 90305, annoys and dismays her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just fed up," she said. "Just because I live here, I pay higher car 
insurance. . . . It's like you are penalized for being successful." 
</P>
<P>
And what of those Southern Californians known for being young, upwardly mobile, 
urban professionals? Try Hermosa Beach, ZIP 90254, where 93.16% of the 
residents fall into the Young Influentials cluster, another 5.39% in Bohemian 
Mix and 1.45% in Money &amp; Brains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Downhill Skier 
</P>
<P>
Yes, said one Young Influential, in this case, Steve Mangiagli, the 37-year-old 
owner of Becker Surfboards, he is a downhill skier, owner of two European cars 
and a drinker of imported wines. 
</P>
<P>
And, coincidentally, added another, actress Sharyn Ober, 25, she and boyfriend 
have just started "Body by Jake," and even in their one-bedroom apartment, they 
have two phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is very yuppish," Ober said, "but with some Bohemian thrown in." 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad analysis, for someone who had never heard of a cluster. 
</P>

TOP 10 'LIFE STYLE CLUSTERS' IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
1. NEW BEGINNINGS (13.52% of households): Includes many divorced Americans 
looking for new jobs and life styles. Predominant age is 18-34, pre-child, 
lower-level white-collar and clerical occupations. 
</P>
<P>
2. YOUNG INFLUENTIALS (9.93%): Young, metropolitan sophisticates, with 
exceptional high-tech, white-collar employment levels. Predominately 
high-spending singles, childless couples, unrelated adults in expensive one and 
two-person homes, apartments and condos. 
</P>
<P>
3. HISPANIC MIX (8.89%): Hispanic barrios featuring dense, row-house areas 
containing large families, many single-parent, with small children. Essentially 
bilingual neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
4. POOLS &amp; PATIOS (8.64%): Once like Furs &amp; Stationwagons, being 
upscale greenbelt suburbs in late child-rearing mode. Today, children have 
grown, leaving aging couples in empty nests. Good educations, high white-collar 
employment, double incomes assure "the good life." 
</P>
<P>
5. BLUE CHIP BLUES (8.6%): Similar to Young Suburbia in most respects except 
social rank. High school educations, blue-collar occupations are reflected in 
fewer high-end incomes and lower home values. 
</P>
<P>
6. NEW MELTING POT (7.26%): New immigrant populations -- often with Hispanic, 
Asian and Middle-Eastern origins -- mixing in traditional urban melting pot 
areas and new immigrant neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
7. SINGLE CITY BLUES (5.36%): Densely urban, downscale singles areas, many 
located near city colleges. With few children, odd mixture of races, classes, 
transients and night trades, could be aptly described as the poor man's 
Bohemia. 
</P>
<P>
8. EMERGENT MINORITIES (4.62%): Almost 80% black, with above average 
concentrations of children, almost half in single-parent homes, below average 
education, white-collar employment. The struggle for emergence from poverty is 
evident here. 
</P>
<P>
9. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE (4.54%): The nation's poorest neighborhoods, with twice 
its unemployment level, and nine times its share of public assistance incomes. 
Large, single-parent families, 70% black, in rented or public high-rise 
buildings interspersed with aging tenement rows. 
</P>
<P>
10. MONEY &amp; BRAINS (4.04%): Dominated by childless couples and a mix of 
upscale singles, it's the nation's second highest socio-economic rank, typified 
by swank, shipshape townhouses, apartments and condos. Sophisticated consumers 
of adult luxuries -- apparel, restaurants, travel.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the fact he found Los Angeles "an ugly city, hot and oppressive," 
Charlie Chaplin lived and worked here from late December, 1913, when he joined 
Mack Sennett's Keystone Co., to Sept. 6, 1952, when he left for England, later 
to be barredfrom returning to the United States by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In four decades here, he became perhaps the planet's most celebrated person of 
his the and made films that will endure -- just as he suspected that Northern 
California would endure long after "Hollywood has disappeared into the 
prehistoric tar pits of Wilshire Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
The years since his 1952 exile have taken their toll on Chaplin's Los Angeles, 
but history and developers have yet to wipe him from the scene -- totally. The 
Charles Chaplin Studios still stand at LaBrea Avenue and DeLongpre Avenue, now 
home of A &amp; M Records. The Georgian-style mansion in which he lived from 
1920 remains on Summit Drive in Beverly Hills, its current owner the 
financially troubled Adnan Khashoggi. 
</P>
<P>
Still standing too is the Circle Theater, on El Centro Avenue, in Hollywood, a 
converted drugstore where a group of young actors, including Chaplin's son 
Sydney Chaplin, were directed anonymously by the star who sought artistic haven 
from troubled times. These days, the Circle Theater continues in operation. 
</P>
<P>
But most indestructible among these physical remembrances are the personal 
memories many have of Chaplin and his days here. 
</P>
<P>
NORMAN LLOYD, actor, producer and featured player in "Limelight." 
</P>

Lloyd became a friend and business partner of Chaplin's after first meeting him 
on the tennis courts of Summit Drive. "He was a kind of 19th-Century genius," 
says Lloyd, who was a regular on "St. Elsewhere" and appears in the upcoming 
"The Dead Poets Society." "He was romantic, poetic -- from another era, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Acting as producer, director, writer, choreographer and composer, few details 
escaped Chaplin's attention during the making of "Limelight." " 'Rightly to be 
great . . . is to find quarrel in a straw,' " Lloyd says, paraphrasing Hamlet. 
"That was Charlie. There was nothing too minute, everything was important." 
</P>
<P>
Every experience was important, as well. With all his success, he couldn't wipe 
away his childhood workhouse days. Lloyd recalls an episode at the house when 
10-year-old Michael Chaplin was dragging a sweater along the ground. "Charlie 
said, 'Get that up off the ground! People had to work for that!' He always 
said, 'I don't believe I deserve dinner unless I do a day's work.' " 
</P>
<P>
SYDNEY CHAPLIN, retired actor, owner of "Chaplin's" restaurant in Rancho 
Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney was born in the house at 1085 Summit Drive, as was his older brother, 
Charlie Jr. His parents divorced before Sydney was a year old and the boys were 
relegated to weekend visits to the house. Sydney remembers tennis games, swims 
in the pools and stepmother Paulette Goddard pulling them out of school for 
trips to Catalina on the Chaplin yacht, Panacea. "She was great with us," he 
says. His father was less available. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he was fun to be around," Sydney says, "but mainly he was 
preoccupied with his work. When I grew up we had more in common." 
</P>
<P>
Sydney joined the Circle Theater at age 21, and Charles directed him in a 
number of productions. "It wasn't bad working with my father," he says, "but he 
was tough on me always. He wanted me to be better than the other people in the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
Sydney went on to play leads in "Lime light" (1952) and "A Countess From Hong 
Kong" (1967). Onstage, he won a Tony starring opposite Barbra Streisand in 
"Funny Girl." Brother Charlie Jr. had less luck with his theatrical interest 
and died at 42, an alcoholic. Sydney isn't a believer in inherited talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because your family is in a business, that helps put you in it," he says. 
"If your father was a coal miner, you'd probably be one too." 
</P>
<P>
GLORIA DeHAVEN, actress. 
</P>
<P>
At age 9, Gloria DeHaven accidentally launched her acting career with a visit 
to the set of "Modern Times," where her father, Carter DeHaven, was assistant 
director. Chaplin needed two little girls to play Paulette Goddard's sisters. 
Gloria and her schoolmate were picked on the spot. "Mr. Chaplin said, 'They're 
perfect.' All we would have to do was wear tattered clothes, eat bananas and 
run away from a truant officer," DeHaven says, laughing at the memory. They 
were sent to Western Costume for tattering, came back to the set and "had a 
marvelous time." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, they were all invited to his house. She was stunned to discover 
that, out of costume and on the tennis court, the funny little tramp was an 
"awesomely attractive man. He had a wonderful physique, tanned and very 
attractive. Then he came in and played the piano, told stories. There wasn't 
anything that he couldn't do. I was totally dazzled by him." 
</P>
<P>
LITA GREY. Retired performer, Chaplin's second wife and mother to Sydney and 
Charles Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Lita Grey gave birth to both her sons in a hospital-equipped delivery room in 
the mansion on Summit Drive and says that she spent many nights waiting alone 
there for her husband to come home. 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin, then 35, had cast the 16-year-old actress as his leading lady in "The 
Gold Rush" but had to replace her in the role when she became pregnant by him. 
The marriage, she says, was forced by her family. "He backed out at first." 
</P>
<P>
Their divorce played for nine months in court and made international headlines 
for far longer. It caused Chaplin to have a nervous breakdown and is said to 
have turned his hair prematurely gray -- Lita is the only one of his four wives 
whom he does not mention by name in his 1964 autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very difficult man to be with," Grey, now in her 80s and living in an 
apartment in West Hollywood, says. "He was a genius, but hard to reach, with a 
big ego and terribly insecure." 
</P>
<P>
Of his notorious attraction to young women, she believes: "He'd try to create 
people. He enjoyed being the first person in a girl's life." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't believe that he ever warmed to fatherhood. "He was never one to 
cuddle and kiss his children. He was always very objective around them. He 
looked as if he was examining them. He saw everyone in a frame. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Jr. sought his father's love and approval all his life," she says. 
"Sydney was well aware of his father's faults, but he didn't let them affect 
him. Charlie was different, he needed his father." 
</P>
<P>
After the divorce, she launched a lengthy career in vaudeville and nightclubs 
as Lita Grey Chaplin. "The name was a definite advantage," Grey says. "But when 
they overpublicized it, when they said the ex-wife of Charlie Chaplin, I made 
them take that down." 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM SCHALLERT, actor, former president of the Screen Actors' Guild. 
</P>
<P>
Schallert, perhaps best known as Patty Duke's television dad, was directed by 
Chaplin in a number of Circle Theater productions. It was a heady experience 
for a young actor, particularly in a theater that Schallert remembers fondly as 
a "rickey tick operation," with barely 100 seats and a small, in-the-round 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin's involvement with the group began shyly, as if testing for acceptance, 
then became total. "After a preview performance," Schallert says, "he'd say, 
'There are just a couple of things I want to suggest.' Then he'd start at the 
top of the play and work his way through the entire first act. When it was 
about 5 or 6 in the morning, Oona (Chaplin's wife) would finally say, 'Come on 
Charlie, let them go home, they've got a performance to do tonight.' Then 
they'd drive off in his little old black Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd end up redoing the play two and three times in two to three nights. By 
opening night, we'd be in a state. It was helter-skelter for inexperienced 
actors, but exciting. It was a remarkable process. It was like if you were a 
painter and working with Picasso. We had some rare treats," Schallert says. 
</P>
<P>
"There was something very endearing about the man. He'd work with us with 
unlimited enthusiasm and affection. Not openly affectionate. There was a little 
wall, there, in fact. He was always 'Mr. Chaplin,' but actions are always 
louder than words." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
JERRY EPSTEIN, producer, director and author of "Remembering Charlie: A 
Pictorial Biography," published this month by Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein, founder of the Circle Theater, shared a friendship and professional 
relationship with Chaplin that lasted until the star's death in 1977. Epstein, 
who produced Chaplin's last film, "A Countess From Hong Kong," feels that the 
Circle Theater, at the outset of the McCarthy era, "was good for (Chaplin) . . 
. to find people who adored him. We didn't care about his politics. He was one 
of those isolated Hollywood figures, like Garbo, an untouchable, and here he 
was just looking for friendship." 
</P>
<P>
The young troupe learned perfectionism under Chaplin's direction. "Charlie 
worked and worked until he got it right. He always told us that the audience 
should think that they're looking through a keyhole. 'I don't want to see any 
acting!' He was after absolute reality." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein recalls the long walks they would share on the streets of Los Angeles 
where Chaplin sought his own sense of reality. "He liked to see people, see how 
they lived. Everything 'talked' to him. His antennae were always out." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing he ever asked in payment for his work at the Circle was, "35 
cents and a cup of black coffee." And Chaplin was never gloomy about his 
pending personal problems. "He used to say he was like an old weed -- you pull 
it out, but it just keeps coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin came back to Hollywood just once, in 1972, to accept a special Oscar. 
He chose not to visit any of his Los Angeles haunts during the visit.

RAMONA PAGEANT: 'A LABOR OF LOVE'; 
</P>
<P>
THE ENDURING ROMANCE ABOUT OLD CALIFORNIA STILL TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS OF 
ACTORS AND AUDIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am going to write a novel, in which will be set forth some Indians' 
experiences in a way to move people's hearts," vowed novelist Helen Hunt 
Jackson in 1883. 
</P>
<P>
The result was "Ramona," a romance of Old California, about the love of a noble 
Indian and a beautiful Mission girl. Published in 1884, Jackson's novel is 
still tugging hearts. And so is Hemet's 66-year-old "Ramona Pageant." 
</P>
<P>
With a cast of more than 350 people, the "Ramona Pageant" uses an entire 
mountainside as its stage and is attended by 39,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The 62nd edition begins its six-week run Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's a large-scale event in terms of audiences, it is a family affair 
backstage, with many of the same participants returning year after year. Cast 
and crew members come from among the 85,000 residents of the Hemet-San Jacinto 
Valley, which includes areas where many incidents in the Ramona story actually 
took place. The stage, a 6,662-seat natural amphitheater called the Ramona 
Bowl, is built in the unspoiled foothills of San Jacinto Mountain -- two miles 
south of Hemet's main street. 
</P>
<P>
Of the numerous actors, stage hands and makeup people who return to the Ramona 
Bowl each year, many compare the coming of pageant time to a homecoming -- a 
homecoming lovingly led by the play's co-directors, Maurice and Hilda Jara. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we have the tryouts, it's like a reunion," said Tom Morlan, who plays 
cowboy Jim Farrar, and has been involved with the pageant for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Those involved refer to the nonprofit pageant as "a labor of love," and say it 
is that sense of love and family that keeps them coming back year after year. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime pageant associates include the Jaras, who have been involved with the 
pageant for 36 years; 27-year stage manager Melba Gilmore, who has been a part 
of the production for 43 years, and her husband, Watson Gilmore, who has played 
the crusty Juan Canito for more than 20 years, and Elmer Grohs, who plays a 
sheepshearer and has been with the play for 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get together it's like old home week," said Hilda Jara. "There's a 
real spirit of family -- I think that's why (the pageant) has lasted so long." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The pageant is administered through the Ramona Pageant Assn., a corporation 
that was formed through the Hemet and San Jacinto chambers of commerce after 
Garnet Holme, the writer and first director of the Ramona Pageant, left the 
rights of the play to the two communities in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of $300,000, only the two leading players, the directors 
and the pageant's office staff are paid, somewhat meagerly, for their efforts. 
But many give up their weekends from mid-January through performance time for 
the play's rehearsals. An additional 500 behind-the-scenes volunteers work 
during show times. 
</P>
<P>
And there's no shortage of cast members, despite the long rehearsal hours and 
lack of remuneration. Maurice Jara said about 25 people try out every year for 
each of the leads, and in this year's auditions, eight women vied for the 
supporting role of Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
The current Ramona, Kathi Anderson, also played the coveted role -- as Kathi 
Sommers -- in 1985. Anderson said that winning back the part was worth enduring 
four years of the tough audition process. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept trying," said Anderson, 36, who added that not being a part of the 
pageant made her feel "like I'd gotten divorced. (Playing Ramona) is like being 
back home again," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's co-star, Christ Thomas, is playing Ramona's husband, Alessandro, for 
the third time. (He also played the role in 1985 and 1986.) Like Anderson, he 
kept auditioning until he won back his role. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was still involved (in secondary roles)," said Thomas, 28, who played a 
sheepshearer at 16 and has been in the play ever since. 
</P>
<P>
And for both leads, the play takes on an added sense of family: Anderson's 
daughter Kristie, 10, and Thomas' daughter Anne, 8, were both selected for 
roles in this year's production. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Jaras, the pageant combines elements of their heritage (Maurice has 
Hispanic ancestry and Hilda is a fifth generation Californian) with their love 
of the stage. After working with the pageant for so many years (Maurice played 
Alessandro for 15 years before becoming the director in 1969), it has become a 
major part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally hit upon a vehicle that takes in all that we want to do with 
something that we understand (Southern California's customs and lore)," Maurice 
Jara said. "This is my biggest enjoyment in life. I stay for . . . the love of 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
"(The pageant) has been my life," agreed Hilda Jara, who relayed the story of 
the couple's involvement with the play. 
</P>
<P>
"Maurice tried out for Alessandro and he fell in love with the play from then 
on," she said. "I'd watch it when he was Alessandro and think, 'Gee, I'd do 
this,' or 'I'd like it this way.' Then the director quit and we started 
(directing the play) ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The "Ramona" story has a long history: four American and one Mexican film 
versions have been made (including a 1910 version directed by D.W. Griffith and 
staring Mary Pickford as Ramona), and at least 10 stage versions have been 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
The Hemet pageant's version (which has had 25 different Ramonas -- including 
Raquel Welch and Anne Archer) debuted in 1923 and has been produced all but 
five years (when war and recession intervened) since then. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a beautiful setting and we use it," said Hilda Jara of the 160-acre 
Ramona Bowl site. "We have action (including posses of horsemen dashing in and 
out of scenes) on the hill, and all around. Most plays with similar settings 
use only the foreground. It's an awesome thing when people appear from way up 
on the hill and are a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ramona Pageant" will be performed Saturday and next Sunday April 22-23, 
April 29 and 30 and May 6 and 7. All shows are at 3 p.m. and tickets are $12 
and $15 (tickets for children under 12 are half-price in the $12 section). 
Parking is free. Information: (714) 658-3111.

LOOKING FOR ROCK OF THE '90S IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
RECORD PRODUCER RICK RUBIN LEFT N. Y. FOR A MORE VITAL SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heads turn as the large, imposing man with the long, unkempt hair and beard 
steps from a car just before midnight on a seedy stretch of Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The dozen or so people loitering around the entrance of a decaying building 
don't appear the types to be easily intimidated. They're mostly men in their 
20s who look at the world with expressionless gazes -- the epitome of L.A. 
street cool. 
</P>
<P>
But they clear a path for this visitor and whisper anxiously to each other as 
he walks past them into the building, which houses rows of ragged, low-budget 
rock 'n' roll rehearsal rooms. 
</P>
<P>
While Rick Rubin may convey the menacing aura of a character in an urban 
psycho-killer film, it's his reputation, not his appearance, that causes this 
late-night buzz. 
</P>
<P>
The guys who stepped back for Rubin are musicians, and they know a nod from 
this man could lead to the break they've dreamed about for years. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, the Long Island native is the patron saint of rock 'n' roll extremists: 
a record producer who thinks bands should challenge, provoke and even offend. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin was in the studio three years ago with the Beastie Boys when the 
Manhattan rap trio combined the three styles that parents love to hate most -- 
punk, rap and heavy metal -- in "Licensed to Ill," as rowdy and irreverent an 
album as ever made the national Top 10. Sales to date: more than 4 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's name is also attached to Slayer's "Reign in Blood," a 1986 album so 
outrageous that Columbia Records refused to release it. The L.A. speed-metal 
band's collection -- reverberating with such themes as satanism, sadism and 
death -- was finally released by Geffen Records. 
</P>
<P>
"Who said rock 'n' roll was supposed to be nice?" Rubin said forcefully. "Rock 
'n' roll is about going against the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other controversial and/or trailblazing acts that have been blessed 
by the Rubin touch: rap stars Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J and Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
But those credits go back to Rubin's New York days when, in addition to his 
role as a free-lance producer, he was co-owner of Def Jam Records, easily the 
hippest source of street-oriented pop in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
However, he left the East Coast last summer to concentrate on the hard rock 
that was his first love. He has since launched his own Def American Records, 
which is distributed by Geffen Records. To underscore his starting-over spirit, 
he settled in Los Angeles, which he feels is a better rock 'n' roll town. It's 
here that he hopes to make his new label, Def American, the cutting-edge record 
company of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll doesn't exist in New York anymore," said Rubin, who lives in a 
two-story, Mediterranean-style house just above the Sunset Strip. "When you 
make a rock 'n' roll record in Manhattan, there is nowhere you can hear it on 
the radio the way you can here on KNAC. There are also no good venues, no real 
club scene happening. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'in' places in New York are these upscale discos, where you see older 
people in suits, drinking champagne. I hate that." 
</P>
<P>
He finds L.A.'s dance clubs and bars more his speed. "Here, I like Bordello on 
Thursday nights, the Cathouse on Tuesday nights. I love going to the Rainbow 
and hanging out there because there's a real rock 'n' roll feel to the place." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the move west, Rubin shows little evidence of tempering his radical 
rock 'n' roll vision. 
</P>
<P>
He still works with Slayer, and his other new bands -- including Danzig and 
Masters of Reality -- are equally against the grain. (See related stories on 
Page 77). 
</P>
<P>
Despite his infatuation with the energy of the local scene, Rubin doesn't 
expect to actually find many new bands for Def American in L.A. clubs. Two of 
his most recent signings are from Chicago and England. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that most of the musicians in L.A. are so aware of what's going 
on in the music industry that they put a band together to get signed . . . a 
band that reflects just what they think record companies are looking for," he 
said. "That takes the adventure out of a band because they are more into making 
a million dollars rather than into loving what they are doing or trying to 
truly express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, however, is a fan of the controversial outlaw rap sounds coming out of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Passing the rehearsal building's broken elevator, Rubin headed for the stairs 
and began the climb to the fourth floor, where one of his new Def American 
signings was rehearsing. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you about Frank Starr, the singer in the band," he said. "I was at 
the Rainbow bar one night and this guy Starr comes in. He had been in a fight 
in the parking lot and his whole face and hands were covered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
"He walks in and everybody's looking at him. So what does he do? He walks over 
to the bar and started drinking like nothing had happened. Is that cool or not? 
I knew this guy belonged on stage." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin is one of the few people in rock who have become stars without stepping 
on a stage. Or at least he hasn't been on stage since his Long Island high 
school days when he fronted a band and did a few gigs at New York's legendary 
punk palace, CBGB's. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he has an image almost as menacing as Slayer itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bloody Reign of Rick Rubin," declares the headline of a recent cover story 
in Sounds, a British journal that leans toward hard rock. The accompanying 
photo shows a grim-faced Rubin, his eyes covered by the trademark dark glasses 
that he favors for photos. 
</P>
<P>
The article itself suggests that no pop figure in this decade has "demonstrated 
so complete or innate an understanding of contemporary black and white street 
(ie., youth) musics." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the "beast on the loose" image, however, Rubin proves surprisingly 
soft-spoken, with a gentle smile and soft eyes behind those shades. 
</P>
<P>
Before the band rehearsal, he sat down for dinner at a modest Italian 
restaurant in the Fairfax area and talked about the image. "I'm a fan of the 
whole outlaw image of rock 'n' roll. I try to make outlaw records and I like to 
act the part. It's part of the entertainment of it all, seeing all these 
characters and living out fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
"I live the life style. I even bought a dumb Dodge Charger because it's a '60s 
muscle car -- complete with a magnum 440 engine, the biggest you can get for 
it. At the bottom of it all, rock 'n' roll is saying 'screw you' to all the 
rules that no one likes but most people end up following." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the outlaw implications of heavy metal and rap, the two music 
forms with which Rubin has been most closely identified? What about parents who 
worry that all the emphasis on sex and violence will warp their kids? 
</P>
<P>
"Art reflects culture, not the other way around," he said sharply. "Go through 
the ages and you'll find the great works of art were always rooted in what was 
going on at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Take N.W.A," he said of the rap band whose controversial "Straight Outta 
Compton" album chronicles the gangbanger life style. "People point a finger at 
the records, but what they don't like is Compton. When you start being scared 
to let art reflect society, then something's wrong in the world, not in the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin wasn't born a rebel. He was raised in an upper-middle-class Long Island 
family and was encouraged by his parents to be a lawyer. And he followed their 
wishes all the way to New York University, where he majored in film. 
</P>
<P>
But along the way he picked up a love for hard rock (particularly Aerosmith and 
AC/DC) and the raw new rap sound that surfaced in New York in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
While still in college, he started producing his own rap records -- and he did 
well enough, critically and commercially, to have Columbia Records give him and 
his partner, Russell Simmons, a seven-figure distribution deal for their Def 
Jam label. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin broke the news to his parents that he was going into the record business 
by sending them a photostat of the first check he and Simmons received under 
the Columbia agreement. It was a way of telling them that they shouldn't feel 
he was throwing his life away just because he was skipping law school. The 
amount of the check: a cool $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, Def Jam has been a symbol of adventure and 
independence in the record world. And Rubin, in the spirit of Phil Spector in 
the '60s,established himself as one of the few producers whose name on a record 
was a virtual guarantee of quality. 
</P>
<P>
But Rubin and Simmons drifted in different directions and last year agreed to 
dissolve their partnership -- a move that led to a series of rumors about bad 
feelings between the two. Both, however, have since denied any ill will. 
</P>
<P>
In starting over, Rubin has to prove himself again -- always a tricky matter in 
the fast-changing pop world. When neither the Danzig nor Masters of Reality 
albums exploded onto the charts (they have sold around 100,000 and 50,000 
respectively), you could already pick up whispers that maybe Rubin was just 
another of yesterday's heroes. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of pressure, Ed Rosenblatt, president of Geffen Records, said, 
"(Rubin) has created an incredibly (high level) benchmark for himself with the 
success he has had in the past. It doesn't mean he is going to (match that 
level) on every record, but -- with someone who has this much talent and vision 
at such a young age, there is no reason he won't do even better." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Hollywood Boulevard rehearsal hall, Rubin listened to Starr's band, 
the Four Horsemen, a name suggested by Rubin in honor of some stars of pro 
wrestling, one of his passions. The tiny room was filled with amplifiers, all 
turned so loud that it was virtually impossible to hear Starr's vocals. 
</P>
<P>
But Rubin heard enough to make some suggestions about the arrangements. He 
spoke in a low-key way, but the musicians listened intently, knowing how often 
he has been right before. 
</P>
<P>
After three songs, Rubin said good night and headed back down the stairs, 
ignoring the curious glances of the musicians still standing by the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
He got in the car and headed to another Hollywood rehearsal hall to check on 
the progress of Trouble, also part of his Def American stable. It's a Christian 
rock band, but nothing like Stryper, which offers a wholesome image and tosses 
Bibles to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys don't preach at all," Rubin said. "Their roots are more Black 
Sabbath than anything else. If you read their lyrics, they're all about 
suicide. It's not an optimistic view. The songs are about being confused and 
not knowing if 'I can make it on any more, but when I die, I know I'll find my 
way.' That's heavy." 
</P>
<P>
Before going into the studio, Rubin paused and reflected again on the the 
pressure on him at Def American. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I think about this business, I realize the important thing for me 
is to keep remembering what has worked for me until now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not trying to figure out what other people are going to like. I don't 
think anyone is that smart, though everyone in this business spends most of 
their time doing that. My success has always been based on making records that 
I like. The bottom line has to be flipping in a cassette, turning it up and 
loving it . . . and counting on enough other people to think the same way I 
do."

CONCRETE BLONDE IN TRANSIT; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER A TROUBLED YEAR, THE L.A. TRIO IS NOW 'FREE' AND A QUARTET

<P>
The first track on the new Concrete Blonde album is about teen warfare and the 
toll exacted by urban violence. The second song is about the hyperactive 
hypocrisy of the cocaine and speed generation. And the third is about the love 
of money, money, money, muhnee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the title "Los Angeles" already has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Like the great band X before it, the slightly more mainstream Concrete Blonde 
speaks for its city in a time of transition, uniting fears of social ills and 
the dread of personal commitment in one pretty, supremely emotive package. 
(Reviewed below.) 
</P>
<P>
On the band's second album (due in stores Monday), singer/songwriter Johnette 
Napolitano sounds both angry and scared, weary and hopeful, ravaged and naive. 
And though she may seem a tough cookie to some -- she's proudly tattooed and 
given to rough language -- she abhors the outlaw image of groups like Guns N' 
Roses, talking up horseback riding and family life instead. 
</P>
<P>
Given Concrete Blonde's well-publicized business troubles of the last year, 
which had the band playing almost as many court dates as concert gigs, one song 
on the album -- Thin Lizzy's "It's Only Money" -- is clearly being sent out as 
a message. 
</P>
<P>
"That song just seemed like what we were going through," said Napolitano, 
sipping tea at dusk in a Silver Lake apartment decorated with religious icons. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out our accountants and manager and lawyer were making three-quarters 
of what we should've been making. It was a pretty bitter realization. They feel 
like they deserve it more than you, because hell, you're just a dumb musician, 
what would you know what to do with $20,000? 
</P>
<P>
"And they're right. As long as these heavy-metal type guys go out and just 
drink beer and (pick up) chicks and do blow, you're damn right, they don't know 
what to do with 20 grand. But the guy in the suit knows exactly where to put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean that if I earn a million dollars I don't want it. Because I 
may not choose to live like a millionaire, but I definitely know what I would 
do with it. I have a mother and a family. And instead of buying drugs you can 
save a kid's life. 
</P>
<P>
"We 'adopted' some kids. The band owns four children now," she says with a 
laugh. "We have three in Chile, Bangladesh and Mexico sponsored through World 
Vision, and we're getting an American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
"If half this city would have all the money they spent on blow last year, God, 
we could feed a whole lot of people. I feel very strongly about that. And I've 
definitely had my experience with it too, but I'm a lot happier since I 
stopped. I haven't touched that stuff in a year . . . because I just don't see 
the reason to hurry. It makes people ugly; people talk so fast." 
</P>
<P>
The song "Run Run Run" is about drugs people use to "keep up with a pace that 
needs to be slowed down. Nobody can keep up with it. . . . They put a 
moratorium on mini-malls in L.A. Thanks. Should've done it five years ago. . . 
. I took the call-waiting off my phone. It's very rude. . . . I take a lot more 
time now. I sit and talk with my nieces, hear what they have to say. There's no 
rush. What are you rushing for? Death? Great! Why? For the next life?" 
</P>
<P>
And as for the metal bands? "I was walking down Hollywood Boulevard and saw a 
Guns N' Roses T-shirt in a shop window showing a needle sticking out of a 
skull. . . . It's a very superficial existence. If you have the attitude of 
'Let's spend it and enjoy it because the world's going to hell anyway,' well, 
that's fine. I don't begrudge anybody their philosophy. But when I look at my 
nieces, why should I have that attitude for them? That's not fair for them." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she says, "God, money's a great thing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But not for making music. "I think it's obscene to spend the money that the 
companies seem to feel is necessary," Napolitano says. 
</P>
<P>
"Why give a producer $60,000? Give it to me! When you know how a studio works, 
then there's no reason to waste money. Videos, too. We made two at the same 
time. We took some beers to a 24-hour Copymat in the middle of the night and 
made the whole album cover there. Maybe we're just cheap, but I'd rather spend 
it on other things than making a record. . . . Rock 'n' roll seems to me to be 
something that you do when you have no money to do anything else. It shouldn't 
be such a high-overhead thing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, money has been of paramount importance to the band these last couple of 
years. Claiming they had none, the trio (recently expanded to a quartet) filed 
bankruptcy proceedings, claiming its label, I.R.S. Records, would not provide 
the cash needed to pay off its debts and that contractually it had no other way 
of accruing cash than through the company. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation ran rampant in town that what Concrete Blonde was really after was 
a much more lucrative contract, preferably with another label. (Geffen Records 
formed an alliance with the band for a time last year.) What's certain is that 
the group withdrew from Chapter 11 proceedings, ended up back at I.R.S. with a 
renegotiated deal, and severed all other business alliances -- legal, financial 
and managerial. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano now says that though the group's original contract with Miles 
Copeland's I.R.S. label was less than fair and really did leave the band broke, 
her advisers at the time pushed her to try and break with the label for their 
own political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles did try over the year to renegotiate the contract and to make us happy," 
Napolitano says. "And by that time we were deep in court and everybody was 
telling us, 'You can't (withdraw), because if you win this case it'll be a 
landmark.' 'For what? Because you want to go golfing and show your name off in 
the Law Journal?' 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically used. It could've been settled a lot sooner if I would've 
been advised differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I never learn. If somebody tells me something, I just believe it. I don't want 
to be cynical. I don't like to be that mistrusting. And I don't think I ever 
could, because I don't think it's my nature."

DETAILS SURFACE OF U.S. DEAL TO AID CONTRAS

<P>
For the men in Ronald Reagan's White House whose mission was to keep the 
Nicaraguan rebels fighting, the first weeks of 1985 were a time of creeping 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Congress had cut off the CIA's covert military aid to the Contras. Stopgap aid 
from Saudi Arabia and Israel was beginning to run low. And then came what 
looked like a potential last straw: Honduras, where the main Contra army was 
camped, threatened to disarm the rebels and halt their military operations 
against Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"Honduran cooperation with (the Contras) . . . must continue if the resistance 
is to survive," Reagan's national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, wrote 
in a secret memorandum to the President later that year. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, Reagan agreed to provide Honduras with what some White House 
documents called a "quid pro quo." If Honduras would tolerate the Contras, it 
would be rewarded with accelerated U.S. economic and military aid. Two months 
later, then-Vice President George Bush told Honduras' leaders that the promised 
aid was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
Did Bush, who has never publicly acknowledged a role in seeking foreign aid for 
the Contras, secretly broker a Contra deal with Honduras? And did the Reagan 
Administration's action violate Congress' Boland Amendment, written by former 
Rep. Edward P. Boland (D-Mass.), which barred the United States from aiding the 
rebels "directly or indirectly"? 
</P>
<P>
Four years after the events, the answers remain unclear. But previously secret 
documents released during the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North 
and interviews with officials who were involved in Bush's mission provide a new 
and more complete account of a once-hidden chapter in the Reagan 
Administration's Central American crusade -- the secret swap of U.S. aid for 
Honduran support for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they were seeking Honduras' support, White House officials recognized 
that their actions violated at least the spirit, if not the letter, of 
Congress' ban on aiding the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
A memo written by North and another aide argued that the deal with Honduras 
should be carried out in secret for that very reason: "Notwithstanding our own 
interpretations (of the law), it is very clear . . . that the legislative 
intent was to deny any direct or indirect support for military/paramilitary 
operations in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the disclosures in the North documents raise serious questions 
about Congress' ability, even by passing a legal ban, to stop a heedless 
President from pursuing secret foreign policies through pressure on U.S. 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of Congress, led by Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), who was 
chairman of the House committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, say 
they may reopen their inquiry to find out exactly what occurred in the Honduran 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The documents clearly suggest that then-Vice President Bush -- now President 
Bush -- was involved in the quid pro quo arrangements with Honduras," Hamilton 
said last week. "I don't think the documents prove that, but they clearly 
suggest it . . . . I think the important thing now is just to get the documents 
out, have the White House turn them over to us as they committed themselves to 
do. Let's get a clean sweep here, and get this information out." 
</P>
<P>
The documents that have been released, and officials who were involved, 
describe the 1985 deal with Honduras not as a single, isolated quid pro quo 
deal. Rather, they say, it was one of many trades of aid for cooperation by the 
impoverished country that had become the most important U.S. military ally in 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hondurans were shaking us down all the time, not just on the Contra 
issue," according to one official. "They wanted more aid for everything they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Honduras, then ruled jointly by President Roberto Suazo Cordova and the chief 
of staff of the armed forces, Brig. Gen. Walter Lopez, had several demands of 
the United States, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main concern in Honduras was that they wanted a security pact with the 
United States, an assurance that we would come to their defense if they were 
invaded," said Langhorne A. Motley, assistant secretary of state at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hondurans also wanted "to know what our intentions were on the 
Contras," he added. When Honduras first allowed the rebels to put their bases 
on its territory, the CIA was promising that the Contras would soon invade 
Nicaragua. Instead, to the Hondurans' dismay, Congress halted U.S. aid to the 
rebels. "Their question was: 'Will the real United States please stand up?' " 
Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hondurans' concerns came together on Jan. 18, 1985, when Lopez and the 
other generals held a dinner for the visiting McFarlane at the Air Force Club 
in Tegucigalpa. The United States, they complained, had left them to play host 
to more than 10,000 Contras, and Nicaragua was threatening to send troops 
across the border to clean the rebels out. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the Hondurans' tirade, McFarlane had heard enough. Without a 
word, as the generals gaped, he walked out of the room -- leaving the U.S. 
ambassador to stammer an excuse about "an urgent appointment," officials who 
were present said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hondurans responded, two weeks later, by privately informing the United 
States that they wanted the Contras removed from their territory or they would 
force the rebels back into Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"They called our bluff," a senior official said. "It was a shakedown." 
</P>
<P>
And it hit its mark. On Feb. 7, 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane convened a meeting of the Crisis Pre-Planning Group, the White House 
National Security Council's panel on urgent foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The CPPG . . . agreed that we should make an approach to the Hondurans which 
emphasizes our commitment to their sovereignty and provides incentives for them 
to persist in aiding the freedom fighters," McFarlane wrote in a memorandum to 
Reagan. "The group further agreed that the incentives should include: 
</P>
<P>
" -- The release of some economic support (We are currently withholding 
disbursement of $174 million until the Hondurans commit to certain economic 
reform). 
</P>
<P>
" -- Expedited security assistance deliveries . . . . 
</P>
<P>
" -- Enhancements to existing CIA programs." 
</P>
<P>
The group recommended also that Reagan send an emissary to Honduras to inform 
the country's leaders of what North, in another memorandum, called "conditions" 
attached to the accelerated aid: continued help for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
All members of the Crisis Pre-Planning Group agreed on this approach, according 
to memos written by North and another NSC aide, Raymond F. Burghardt. But a 
bureaucratic squabble erupted over who would carry the private message about 
the aid's "conditions" to the Hondurans. 
</P>
<P>
"We will need to decide who the emissary will be," McFarlane's deputy, John M. 
Poindexter, wrote in a note to his boss. "It should not be Motley -- maybe Dick 
Walters." Vernon A. Walters, President Bush's nominee as ambassador to West 
Germany, was then a special adviser at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Motley, who had been engaged in a long-running turf battle with the NSC over 
Central America, objected to the idea of entrusting the message to someone 
else. "We had a U.S. ambassador who was perfectly capable of delivering the 
mail," he said last week. "With special emissaries, you never know whether 
they're following their instructions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise on Message 
</P>
<P>
Motley won -- sort of. The initial message to the Hondurans would go through 
the U.S. ambassador in Honduras, John D. Negroponte (now Bush's nominee as 
ambassador to Mexico). But a few weeks later, the NSC would send its own man, 
Burghardt, to Honduras -- ostensibly to hand-carry a formal copy of the message 
that Negroponte had already transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
And, in March, then-Vice President Bush was scheduled to visit Honduras. He, 
too, could reaffirm U.S. interests in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The bureaucrats were also debating what Negroponte should tell the Hondurans. 
North and Burghardt drafted "talking points" for the ambassador that included 
an explicit reference to the link between the added U.S. aid and the Contras: 
"In order to ensure that our appreciation manifests itself in more than words, 
the President has directed that my government undertake to provide expedited 
delivery on certain items of assistance to your country." 
</P>
<P>
But North and Burghardt warned that it was a bad idea to have the ambassador 
deliver that message because turning the matter over to the State Department 
could lead to a leak. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, all Administration officials have been able to state to the Congress 
that we have not approached any other government to support the resistance," 
they wrote -- even though they both knew, according to documents, that several 
governments had already been approached. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter apparently agreed. He crossed out the reference to a quid pro quo in 
the talking points and scrawled next to it: "Add that we want VP to also 
discuss this matter with Suazo." 
</P>
<P>
That left Negroponte with a more general message to deliver, plus a letter from 
President Reagan calling on Honduras "to continue to do all in its power to 
support those who struggle for freedom and democracy." Also, the NSC informed 
the State Department: "The vice president will discuss with President (Suazo) 
the issues raised in President Reagan's letter during his visit to Honduras." 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte delivered Reagan's letter and the accompanying message to Suazo on 
Feb. 24. In an interview last week, he said he remembered nothing like a swap 
of aid in exchange for Honduran help on the Contra issue. "There was no quid 
pro quo from my perspective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, the NSC's Burghardt -- who had helped draft the quid pro quo 
language -- arrived in Tegucigalpa for his own meetings with Honduran 
officials. "If there was a quid pro quo discussed, it was probably then," a 
senior official said. Burghardt, who now serves in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, 
could not be reached for his account. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the accelerated aid was beginning to flow. The State Department told 
the Hondurans that it was preparing to release $72.5 million in economic aid 
that had been held up to pressure the country to make economic reforms. ("The 
economic guys weren't happy about that," one official recalled.) The Pentagon 
readied expedited shipments of military equipment to the Honduran armed forces: 
M-16 rifles, ammunition, trucks and boots. 
</P>
<P>
The return message came through the U.S. military in early March, according to 
a document released in the North trial: "The military leaders of Honduras . . . 
offered assurances that the resistance could continue to deliver supplies 
through Honduras, and that Honduras would continue to supply end-user 
certificates for arms purchases by the resistance." End-user certificates are 
licenses to buy military weaponry on the international market. 
</P>
<P>
So, by the time Bush arrived in Honduras on March 16, the deal was already 
done. Bush met with President Suazo at the Honduran's country home in La Paz, 
near the giant U.S. military base at Palmerola. Both Motley and Negroponte, who 
were present, insist that there was no explicit talk of a swap. 
</P>
<P>
Motley acknowledged that the United States was using its aid as leverage to 
encourage Honduras to help the Contras but denied that such a linkage amounted 
to a quid pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
"You speed up the (aid) pipeline, and at the same time you tell him your 
concerns," Motley said. "That isn't a quid pro quo. . . . We don't work that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 10-page cable of minutes from the Bush-Suazo meeting that the U.S. 
Embassy in Honduras sent to Washington does not mention any explicit linkage 
between U.S. aid and Honduran help for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
An official with access to the cable said it describes Bush's hourlong talk 
with Suazo as touching on both the U.S. decision to accelerate aid to Honduras 
and the Hondurans' commitment to continue supporting the Contras -- but not in 
the context of a quid pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has refused to explain his role in the dealings with Honduras, or even to 
say whether he understood that the aid he was describing to the Hondurans had 
anything to do with their help on the Contra issue. But he did say last week 
that Negroponte and Motley's accounts of his visit to Honduras were correct. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery of aid was a success. So much military equipment was flooding into 
Honduras that "there was some concern early on that (the shipments) would 
logistically overwhelm the Hondurans' ability to absorb the materiel," North 
wrote in a memo nine days after the Bush visit. 
</P>
<P>
"This apparently has not happened," he wrote, "and the Hondurans have expressed 
their gratitude through those who are supporting the resistance forces." 
</P>
<P>
But it was only one round among many in the U.S.-Honduran tangle, officials 
said. Only a month later, after Congress again rejected U.S. aid for the 
Contras, the Honduran military threatened once again to disarm the rebels. 
Reagan himself had to telephone Suazo to urge him to stop any such move. 
</P>
<P>
"(Suazo) expressed his support of me and his belief we must continue to oppose 
Communism," Reagan's own handwritten notes of the conversation say. "Will call 
his mil commander . . . " Then, Reagan noted, Suazo brought up another subject: 
Honduras was seeking the release of "about $75 mil in aid."

JAILHOUSE SNITCHES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADING LIES FOR FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When veteran jailhouse informant Leslie Vernon White picked up a telephone last 
fall and showed authorities how easily he could fake the confession of another 
inmate, he cracked open a window on a secret world. 
</P>
<P>
At any given time, Los Angeles County jails hold between 50 and 100 informants 
-- many of them career criminals like White -- who have engaged in relentless 
campaigns to implicate their fellow prisoners in crimes and thus earn the 
ultimate favor from authorities: early release from custody. 
</P>
<P>
Often vicious and corrupt, the process is known in the jargon of the jail as 
"booking." The term derives from the phrase, "Book 'em, Danno," from the old 
television series "Hawaii Five-O." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Want to Go Home' 
</P>
<P>
"Now me and every other K-9 (informant) I've talked to have the same policy," 
explained Steve Vulpis, a one-time prisoner at Los Angeles County Jail, now in 
state prison. "The guy's guilty. Who gives a damn? I want to go home." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to assess the impact of jailhouse informants on the criminal 
justice system, The Times spent three months studying their world -- 
interviewing informants, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers and 
legal scholars, and reviewing official records in dozens of criminal cases 
involving alleged inmate confessions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cases reviewed, the study turned up three in which suspects were 
wrongly charged by the district attorney's office or wrongly detained in jail 
because of fabricated confessions. 
</P>
<P>
In many other cases, it was impossible to determine if reported jailhouse 
confessions were real or had been faked. 
</P>
<P>
As veteran informant Mark Scott Cleveland explained, truth doesn't matter. "A 
way you can get around maybe not being able to get a confession right away is 
create one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Techniques 
</P>
<P>
To gather the information that will make a confession appear plausible, 
informants have used a variety of techniques, ranging from the artful to the 
crude. 
</P>
<P>
Some informants, for example, have carefully maintained files of newspaper and 
magazine articles on sensational criminal cases, or have stolen legal documents 
from the cells of other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
They have conned fellow prisoners, even those who have insisted on their 
innocence, into giving up key details of the cases against them. Some have 
pretended to be jailhouse lawyers offering free advice. Others merely have 
asked why someone is in jail, then transformed the most sincere protestations 
of innocence into admissions of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Informants have purchased information from other informants for money, candy or 
cigarettes. Some informants have testified that they received inside 
information from police. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of information, informants sometimes have worked together. They call 
it "getting in the car" -- a graphic metaphor for a ride home from jail. 
</P>
<P>
The Times obtained letters passed between informants that illustrate this 
collegial process. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to one inmate whom they were trying to implicate in a murder, an 
informant wrote: "He will not be moved. The loutent (lieutenant) said so. He 
will stay right here for us to finish bookin' him. Also, we must keep our 
stories togeather (sic). We are in the car." 
</P>
<P>
But inside the informant tank -- the segregated cellblocks where most 
informants spend their time when they are not in court -- rivalries sometimes 
intrude. Not surprisingly, informants who are willing to lie about murder 
confessions are willing to betray their fellow informants. 
</P>
<P>
In one such case, Leslie White begged informant Anthony Cornejo to share 
information about a murder confession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Might Be Too Many 
</P>
<P>
Two informants were already lined up to testify and White apparently feared 
that three would be too many. So he asked Cornejo's help in discrediting the 
testimony of the other informant. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this OK?" White wrote Cornejo. "Tony, I need this case." 
</P>
<P>
White had good reason to believe that he could trade his testimony for a favor. 
A convicted kidnaper and robber, he repeatedly had been released from jail for 
reporting murder confessions. 
</P>
<P>
While reduced sentences are the most dramatic rewards informants have received, 
they also have earned a host of lesser favors. 
</P>
<P>
These have ranged from increased access to creature comforts in jail to 
opportunities to participate in excursions out of jail on undercover operations 
with the police. 
</P>
<P>
The favors also have included cash payments of $5 or $10 from individual police 
officers and $1,000 or more from official witness protection funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The motivation to lie is too great," White said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sorting Out the Truth 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have long faced the problem of sorting out genuine confessions from 
those that have been fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade in Los Angeles County, informants have testified in cases 
against more than 200 defendants -- mainly accused murderers, according to 
reviews by the district attorney's office and defense attorneys. In scores of 
other cases, defense attorneys said, the threat that informants would testify 
has prompted defendants to plead guilty in return for lesser sentences. 
</P>
<P>
In some high-publicity cases, such as the 1985 murder of a Los Angeles police 
detective who was gunned down while picking up his 6-year-old son at school, as 
many as 25 informants have come forward to offer information, including 
purported confessions, to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, authorities have relied on a two-pronged test to decide whether 
an informant is telling the truth: Did the informant offer facts that should 
have been known only by the criminal? And were the informant and the accused 
ever together in jail? 
</P>
<P>
But when White made his phone calls last October, he destroyed the assumptions 
that supported that test. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Telephone 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with only a telephone and the last name of an inmate he did not know, 
White impersonated police officers and prosecutors and squeezed enough 
information from law enforcement officials to fabricate a plausible confession. 
Then he created a phony record showing that he and the accused had been 
together in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Proximity and a few facts were all that were necessary for longtime informant 
Daniel Armenta when he "booked" a fellow inmate for murder in a jailhouse 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
Armenta was used as a witness in the case despite the highly improbable way he 
obtained the supposed confession. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the man he "booked," Raul Andujo, was chained to a 
chair in an interview room at East Los Angeles Municipal Court. The door opened 
and a sheriff's deputy ushered in Armenta -- a heroin addict from Andujo's 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Andujo said he took one look at Armenta and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
"Get this inmate out of here," the sheriff's deputy recalled Andujo as saying. 
"He's a snitch. I don't want him near me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both in Court 
</P>
<P>
Andujo's plea went unheeded and nearly a year later, Armenta and Andujo were in 
the same room again. This time it was a courtroom downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Armenta testified that, on that day in East Los Angeles, Andujo had confessed 
to him that he was guilty of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
On the strength of Armenta's testimony, Andujo was ordered to stand trial and 
was jailed on high bail for more than a year. Ultimately, he was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Armenta was soon at work again. This time he said he was on a jail bus when 
another inmate -- a stranger -- confessed to a murder. That case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The informant tank is full of stories like Armenta's. 
</P>
<P>
Here are five others that The Times has investigated in detail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Snitch Professor 
</P>
<P>
In secretly recorded telephone conversations, a gifted informant teaches a 
triple murderer tricks of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime jailhouse informant Sidney Storch was on the phone, giving a triple 
murderer a friendly lecture on the art of informing. 
</P>
<P>
A check forger who has been in and out of jail much of his life, Storch 
explained how the killer could trade confessions of other inmates for official 
favors. Storch pointed out that confessions need not be real. 
</P>
<P>
"Go for the jugular," Storch advised. "You're going to have to be b--- s----ing 
a little bit, but you may as well get used to that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Storch, then 41, went on to suggest how the killer, Robert Harris Ormsbee, 23, 
might fake the confession of a jailed police officer accused of several yacht 
thefts and two killings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Somebody Needed Killing' 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to what I'm going to tell you," Storch told his pupil. "All it would 
really take to book this guy is: 'I was involved with the yachts. My partners 
and I got so deep off into this, that somebody needed killing and we did.' " 
</P>
<P>
Regarded by some peers as an informant extraordinaire, Storch himself was being 
"booked" as he offered Ormsbee advice in the fall of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With Ormsbee's cooperation, the telephone conversations were secretly 
tape-recorded on behalf of the accused police officer, William Leasure, whom 
Ormsbee had befriended. The tape was made during conference calls by a third 
party outside the jail. 
</P>
<P>
When the calls were made, Storch recently had been released from County Jail. 
He explained that because he had never been jailed near Leasure, he was not in 
a position to testify that Leasure had confessed. But Ormsbee was. Storch 
volunteered to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have a car in about a week," Storch told Ormsbee. "And then once I get 
the car, I can go down to the library." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Articles 
</P>
<P>
The visit to the library, Ormsbee explained in an interview, would allow Storch 
to read newspaper stories on Leasure's legal problems, and pass the information 
to Ormsbee. Then, Ormsbee said, he could "go to court and say, 'Well, Leasure 
told me (the story) personally.' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the library technique, Storch was acquainted with Leslie White's 
method of impersonating law enforcement authorities to obtain information on 
cases over the telephone, several informants said. In one incident last July, 
authorities suspect that Storch and White used that ploy in an attempt to 
obtain the names of witnesses in a murder case in which they were seeking to 
testify. White has admitted his role in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Through his attorney, Storch declined The Times' request to discuss his 
conversations with Ormsbee. 
</P>
<P>
Now serving a 75-year-to-life sentence for the 1984 "Mini-Manson Family" 
killings, Ormsbee said that Storch repeatedly suggested that the way to win 
official favors was to tell authorities that other inmates had confessed their 
crimes, even when they had not. 
</P>
<P>
Citing as an example an informant who he said had had a 30-year sentence cut to 
six months, Storch suggested, "If you look at it proportionally, they might cut 
75 years down to 25." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underscores Message 
</P>
<P>
In a letter mailed to Ormsbee from another unit of the jail, shortly before 
Storch's release in 1987, Storch underscored his message. Referring to inmates 
housed near Ormsbee who were accused of serious crimes, Storch wrote: "You're 
sitting on a smoking row -- used properly, you could cut your time way down." 
</P>
<P>
Ormsbee said: "I took that to mean with Leasure looking at death, (and accused 
killers and former police officers Richard) Ford and (Robert) Von Villas 
looking at death, that I was with some pretty heavy cases, and I could get my 
own . . . (time) knocked off, if I decided to testify on all of them, or one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Storch added: "Make sure you call me. I'll do your research." 
</P>
<P>
Ormsbee said he believed that Storch meant: "If I picked out my victim, I can 
call him and say . . . 'Look Storch, I'm going to do Ford, you know, why don't 
you give me the proper information on him?' " 
</P>
<P>
It is likely that Storch would have taken credit with authorities for whatever 
information Ormsbee had provided, Ormsbee said. "He's just a real slime ball," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Others have expressed similar views, more delicately. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highly Manipulative' 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant is a highly manipulative, super-sophisticated, criminally 
oriented con artist," Los Angeles County Deputy Probation Officer Joan Zeise 
wrote of Storch in connection with a 1985 forgery case. "He is very 
cooperative, conversant and charming, which enables him to be highly successful 
in his chosen vocation of forgery." 
</P>
<P>
Storch's criminal record dates back at least to 1967, when he received a 
suspended sentence for stealing a car in New York. Since he arrived in 
California six years ago, he has been convicted of at least three felonies -- 
mainly involving incidents in which he tried to cash forged checks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those convictions, Storch has spent only seven months in state prison, 
according to the California Department of Corrections. He has been in and out 
of Los Angeles County Jail at least nine times in the last six years, according 
to jail records. The longest single period he served was 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ormsbee, Storch attributes his ability to get out of jail to his 
skill at delivering confessions. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you get out of all this?," Ormsbee said he once asked Storch. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'Well, I get out of going to prison mostly. . . .' He says, 'I can go 
out there, write checks . . . and I never have to worry about doing more than a 
year.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Confession' Statements 
</P>
<P>
On at least a dozen occasions, Storch told authorities that he was present when 
another inmate confessed to a crime. Others familiar with Storch said they 
believe he has given "confession" statements to police in more than 20 cases. 
Storch has taken the witness stand in at least a half-dozen criminal trials or 
preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
According to Storch's testimony and statements to police, defendants who made 
incriminating statements to him include: Bobby Joe Maxwell, convicted in 1984 
of two of the "Skid Row Stabber" killings; Tracey Carter, accused of the 1987 
robbery and murder of a minister who had stopped to use a pay telephone in 
South-Central Los Angeles, and Stewart Woodman, charged with engineering the 
"Ninja"-style killing of Woodman's parents in the garage of their fashionable 
Brentwood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Said inmate Daniel Roach: "It seems that half the world just confesses to 
Sidney Storch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Booked Before He Knew It 
</P>
<P>
An accused murderer finds himself in a cell next to the informant tank. Before 
he arrives, the informants know all about him. Before he leaves, three of them 
say he has confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the jail in the old Hall of Justice, the informants were abuzz. 
</P>
<P>
Among the "snitches" housed together on the 14th floor, the word was out: A 
frail transsexual known as Terry Craig was on his way over. 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who was being moved to the administrative segregation unit because he 
had been in a fight in the transsexual tank, was facing the most serious of 
charges -- murder. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran informant Sidney Storch took up a whispered chant. "His name's Terry 
Craig, his name's Terry Craig." Then he told his fellow inmates, "We can all go 
home on this if we play it right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning to Lie 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Roach, a 25-year-old car thief housed on the row that day last August, 
knew what was about to happen. His colleagues were planning to lie to 
authorities and tell them that Craig had confessed his role in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the K-9 (informant) row, they know everything about Terry Craig, and he 
isn't even on the row yet!" Roach said in an interview. "They're talking about 
who's going to book him and who's got the better story." 
</P>
<P>
A convicted prostitute, Craig was charged with murder after he had an argument 
with another inmate in the transsexual tank. The other inmate, Eduardo de la 
Vega, was a longtime acquaintance with whom Craig had once lived. 
</P>
<P>
De la Vega told authorities that four years earlier he had watched Craig kill 
another transsexual in a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Relying almost exclusively on De la Vega's statement, authorities charged Craig 
with murder. But their case was weak. De la Vega admitted on the witness stand 
that he had 54 aliases and had been convicted of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
The informants went to work as soon as Craig was moved to their tier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells Intentions 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Harold Hall, a murder suspect, immediately voiced his intentions, 
according to Roach. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he put it was, 'I'm going to book this (homosexual),' " Roach 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Another informant, Michael Panie, had the same idea, Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
Panie approached Leslie White to purchase incriminating information, Roach 
said. He said he overheard them strike a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want a carton of cigarettes out of it," Roach quoted White as saying. 
</P>
<P>
White confirmed Roach's account, although Panie denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Roach said, Panie told him he had obtained Craig's confession: "I got 
handwritten proof now." 
</P>
<P>
Roach said he asked Panie what he meant. "He goes, 'Terry Craig gave me a note 
that was handwritten, proof, a confession to his murder.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could 'All Go Home' 
</P>
<P>
Panie then smiled, according to Roach, and confided that the note actually had 
been forged by Storch, the informant who had passed the word to others on the 
tier that they could "all go home" on Craig's case. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Panie acknowledged that the note he presented to authorities 
was handed to him by Storch, but said he did not know whether Storch had faked 
it. Panie, who is in custody out of state, said Storch "tried to weasel his way 
into" the Craig case, but was "shut out" by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The day that Panie told detectives of Craig's confessional note, Storch was 
making a statement of his own. In addition to receiving the note, Storch 
asserted, he had overheard Craig make incriminating statements, according to 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Roach said, he was convinced that none of it was true. 
"Nobody had conversations with Terry Craig. Terry Craig (whose real name is 
Jonathan Reyes and whose native language is Spanish) was a very quiet person, 
speaks English not very well." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Shrader decided against using any of 
the informants at Craig's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Duplicate Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Shrader said she concluded that the note that Panie had provided was not 
written by Craig, and that Storch did little more than duplicate Panie's 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other informant -- Hall -- Shrader said: "He couldn't tell us anything, 
I'm sure, that would outweigh anything he might want on his (own murder) case. 
. . . He's obviously going to want something. I don't see him out of the blue, 
just volunteering. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the district attorney's office did not need the services of 
Storch, Hall and Panie to get past a preliminary hearing. On the strength of De 
la Vega's testimony, Craig is now awaiting trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewarding a Liar 
</P>
<P>
An informant can lie about a murder, admit that he has lied, and still be the 
state's star witness -- and he can get a reward. 
</P>
<P>
There was a big problem with Israel Issacs' claim that he had witnessed a 
murder outside an Echo Park bar: Issacs was in jail at the time. He couldn't 
possibly have seen the killing. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors at the district attorney's office did not view this as an 
insurmountable problem. 
</P>
<P>
They used Issacs as their star witness anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot was that Jose Calderin, a 30-year-old truck driver, whose only 
criminal record was for possession of marijuana, spent 10 weeks in jail as a 
murder suspect before the charges were dropped in the interests of justice. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Issacs' story in the murder case was detected by his own 
attorney, Edward Gritz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Represented Both 
</P>
<P>
Gritz noticed because, as it happened, he also represented the accused killer, 
Calderin. 
</P>
<P>
While reviewing police reports about Calderin's case, Gritz discovered that 
Issacs was the only witness against Calderin. So he went to see Issacs in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I say to him, 'Are you sure you saw Jose shoot this guy in the head?' " Gritz 
recalled. "According to my records, you were in the County Jail when this 
shooting took place. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'No, no, I wasn't in the County Jail then.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then he began to think and think and think," Gritz said. "Then he says, 'Thank 
you. You're right. But let me tell you what actually happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
And without missing a beat, Issacs told him that Calderin had confessed to him 
in jail, Gritz recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Tries Again 
</P>
<P>
Gritz said he pointed out that this could not be true either, since Calderin 
wasn't jailed until Issacs had identified him as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
So Issacs tried again. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," Gritz recalled him saying, "I made a phone call to a 
friend's house and Jose picked up the phone and told me, 'Guess who I just 
killed?' " 
</P>
<P>
Issacs was an informant who badly wanted to get out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
His cellmate at the time, another informant named George Freeman, recalled in 
an interview that Issacs, 31, was wildly in love with a 17-year-old girl, and 
was literally pulling his hair out and saving it in an envelope, crying over 
the girl and saying, "I really got to get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Although Issacs also told prosecutors that he had changed his story, they put 
him on the witness stand as the only person who could link Calderin to the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Listened on Extension 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing in 1984, Issacs testified that he had heard Calderin 
confess to a mutual friend while listening in on an extension phone at the 
friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the friend was dead, Issacs refused to name him. He said the 
friend's family might be in danger from a group of Colombians and Cubans who 
were dealing in cocaine and murder. He implied that Calderin was part of this 
group. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of Issacs' testimony, a judge ordered Calderin to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
But the same day, prosecutor Mark Merrick concluded that Issacs, his star 
witness, was a liar, and that no reasonable juror would believe him. Merrick 
recorded the observations in an internal report on the case's progress. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he decided to press on with the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Merrick said he had reason to be suspicious of Calderin 
because Calderin had been present at another restaurant when another murder had 
taken place. Merrick conceded, however, that, in Calderin, "I didn't know if I 
had a hit man or somebody who went out to dinner at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Found Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
Investigators continued to search for witnesses other than Issacs who could 
link Calderin to the killing. They were never found. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, five months after the preliminary hearing, on the eve of Calderin's 
scheduled trial, Merrick moved to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no intention of ever trying this case," Merrick said in a recent 
interview. "Not with just him (Issacs)." 
</P>
<P>
Merrick also said he had delayed dismissing the case for another reason. He had 
hoped that Calderin would trade the authorities information about the group of 
Colombian and Cuban drug dealers and murderers that Issacs had mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Issacs, meanwhile, was rewarded by authorities with early release from jail. 
</P>
<P>
A con man, drug dealer and convicted murderer, Issacs had been arrested on 
forgery charges. He had faced a maximum sentence of four years and four months 
-- which in practice would have translated to a little more than two years. But 
he was released after less than one year, when another prosecutor, Jeffrey 
Jonas, told a judge that Issacs had provided information in an investigation 
into more than 50 unsolved murders involving Colombians and Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept a Promise 
</P>
<P>
 Jonas said in an interview that he cut the deal on Issacs' behalf to keep a 
promise he had made to a sheriff's sergeant, who had been using Issacs as an 
informant in the jail. Issacs had provided information on a number of cases, 
including an alleged confession in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case. 
</P>
<P>
Jonas said his own assessment of Issacs' credibility "on a scale of zero to 10 
was zero." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he expected that Issacs, who had been placed on probation, would 
violate its terms and could then be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Issacs proved Jonas partially right. He promptly violated the terms of his 
probation by disappearing. He was never caught. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did hear from him once, when he telephoned a district attorney's 
investigator to report that he had just earned $32,000 selling cocaine. "I'm 
too smart for you guys," the investigator recalled Issacs saying. "I'm doing a 
lot of business out here on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
As for Calderin, less than a year after his release, he was with four women in 
another restaurant, when a stranger made passes and obscene remarks. In the 
midst of a fight, Calderin pulled a handgun and shot the stranger and the 
stranger's friend. The stranger died. Calderin pleaded guilty to voluntary 
manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Man Who Would Be Snitch 
</P>
<P>
Officials repeatedly reject a petty criminal's requests to get into the 
informant tank -- until he makes them an offer they can't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Slawinski had a modest ambition. He wanted to be officially certified 
as an informant. 
</P>
<P>
In and out of jail for stealing checks from family and friends, Slawinski 
repeatedly requested informant status from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. But it was repeatedly denied. 
</P>
<P>
Slawinski said he needed a "snitch jacket" for his own protection. "I've got a 
lot of enemies. I've worked on the street," he said in an interview. But the 
Sheriff's Department said the information he had provided was of so little 
significance that he was in no danger. 
</P>
<P>
A week after he was turned down for the fourth time, Slawinski found the means 
to an end. It was late 1987 when jailers moved Arthur Toscano into his cell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small-Time Criminal 
</P>
<P>
At first, Toscano appeared to be just another small-time criminal, in jail for 
violating probation for being under the influence of PCP. 
</P>
<P>
But the picture changed when Toscano received a visit from a sheriff's homicide 
detective. The detective had gotten Toscano's name from a murder suspect who 
claimed that Toscano was his alibi. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the detective's visit, Slawinski was on the phone to the same 
detective, explaining that he had solved the case. 
</P>
<P>
After the visit, he said, Toscano returned to the cell and confessed the murder 
to another of their five cellmates. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives interviewed the other cellmates, who denied hearing the confession, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Sims. Based solely on Slawinski's account, Sims 
filed a murder charge against Toscano. In evaluating Slawinski's truthfulness, 
the prosecutor said he relied heavily on the judgment of the detective, David 
Kushner, whom Sims said he had known for years. Kushner did not return 
telephone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordered to Stand Trial 
</P>
<P>
Toscano, who had not been a suspect in the murder until Slawinski said he 
confessed, was ordered to stand trial and was held on high bail. 
</P>
<P>
His trial had already begun nearly a year later, in October, 1988, when Sims 
concluded that Slawinski was a liar and decided to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said he was persuaded by an unusually painstaking defense 
investigation, which, among other things, pinned down the time of the murder to 
a period for which Toscano had a convincing alibi. He was at work in a 
warehouse where employees were required to punch in and out on a time clock. 
</P>
<P>
"But for Mr. Toscano's proof of his whereabouts," said Stephen Webber, a 
court-appointed defense attorney, "he likely would be a convicted murderer 
today solely because of a false informant." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Sims, however, said he was more impressed with something else the 
defense investigation turned up -- Slawinski's repeated efforts to become an 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Wasn't Aware 
</P>
<P>
Sims said he had not known that Slawinski was desperately trying to become an 
official snitch. He said he did not believe the detective had known either. Had 
Sims known, he said, he would not have charged Toscano only on Slawinski's 
say-so. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave him a motive to fabricate," Sims said. The prosecutor said he believed 
Slawinski because the informant had provided information that theoretically 
could only have been known by the murderer, an eyewitness, or the police -- 
that the victim had been shot about six times in the head with a small caliber 
gun during a marijuana sale. 
</P>
<P>
But when Sims confronted Slawinski with the evidence the defense had uncovered, 
he said Slawinski became uncomfortable and changed his story about the way in 
which he obtained the confession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Bothers Me' 
</P>
<P>
Disgusted, Sims said: "I don't believe he's telling the truth. I don't know how 
he got the information he got. . . . It bothers me . . . because he had unique 
information in regard to the killing." 
</P>
<P>
But by then, Slawinski had what he wanted: He had been granted official snitch 
status, had been placed in protective custody, had obtained another supposed 
murder confession -- this one on a jail bus on the eve of his own trial -- and 
twice had been let out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Slawinski said he told the truth whenever he informed. But he 
said that perhaps as many as half of all jailhouse informants do not. "A lot of 
K-9s, the . . . (expletive) they do is unreal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Battle Of Informants 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Dykes walks into the informant tank as a witness to murder and walks out 
as the accused murderer. Three informants say he has confessed. Four others say 
the first three are lying. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after Kevin Dykes told Compton police he had seen a friend stabbed 
to death, detectives arrested the alleged killers. 
</P>
<P>
Days after that, Dykes was picked up on a street corner for possessing rock 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Because he could not immediately post $250 for a bail bond, he was jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Because he had provided information on the murder case, he was placed in the 
informants' tank. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, he may never get out. 
</P>
<P>
Before he could make bail, three veteran jailhouse informants "booked" Dykes 
for the murder he said he had only witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped Stab Victim 
</P>
<P>
The informants said Dykes told them he was a major drug dealer who had ordered 
two employees to commit the murder, and helped them stab the victim to death. 
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors and friends testified that Dykes had never had any money, 
much less hired help, he was convicted of the 1986 murder and of two attempted 
murders -- also stabbings -- that he claimed to have witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to 24 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes, in testimony and in his statement to police, admitted that he was not 
blameless in the brutal death of his friend, who was stabbed 81 times. His 
testimony showed that he had a gun and could have intervened. But he said he 
was too afraid of the killers. 
</P>
<P>
To prove Dykes guilty of murder, the prosecution had to show that he intended 
to kill his friend -- not merely that he had failed to stop the killers, legal 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliot Alhadeff, wrote in a memo to his 
superiors, that "the entire case against Dykes in the murder . . . rested on 
his confession to the informants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Intent Was Clear 
</P>
<P>
However, he said in an interview that Dykes' intent to kill was clear from 
Dykes' statements to police and in court. Dykes admitted that he told the 
killers he would serve as their lookout; helped them dump his friend's body, 
and suggested that they clean up the bloody driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Because the informants' testimony was important, if not critical to the 
prosecution, Dykes' defense attorney attacked it by calling informants of his 
own. They testified that the prosecution's informants were liars. 
</P>
<P>
The trial took on the character of a Byzantine battle. Where the truth lay was 
anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
First up for the prosecution was veteran jailhouse informant Willie Battle, a 
robber and burglar known by 20 other names. 
</P>
<P>
Battle testified that Dykes told him he was a drug dealer who personally 
stabbed his friend 40 to 50 times. Battle also said Dykes told him that he had 
"henchmen" who helped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experienced Witness 
</P>
<P>
Battle was an experienced witness who had reported confessions of at least nine 
other inmates and testified against five. 
</P>
<P>
Next came prosecution witness Jesse Williams, a burglar and veteran informant 
who testified that Dykes ordered "bodyguards" to kill his friend, then helped 
with the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
Then the prosecution called Leslie White. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes met White after he was transferred from the informant tank to a jail 
section used for inmates who need protection from people in the informant tank. 
</P>
<P>
White testified that Dykes bragged that he was a big drug dealer who would pay 
inmates -- including White -- to lie by saying that the first set of informants 
had admitted they were lying. 
</P>
<P>
But White said the truth was that Dykes admitted having confessed to Williams 
and Battle -- and then confessed to him, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Informant 
</P>
<P>
To discredit Williams and Battle, the defense produced informant Edward Moran, 
who testified that Dykes had been framed. Moran said he knew because he had 
been in on the plot. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when Dykes entered the informant tank: 
</P>
<P>
Dykes told other inmates that he was there because he had witnessed the 
stabbing. Then Williams remarked that Dykes represented "an easy way for . . . 
us to go home." 
</P>
<P>
Battle agreed to join in the plot. Moran said he did, too. Moran said he made a 
false statement to police that had been written out for him by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office then tried to discredit Moran. Veteran informant 
James Jackson, a con man, said he had heard Moran swear after a run-in with 
jailers that he intended to "destroy (the case against Dykes) in any way he 
could." 
</P>
<P>
The next move fell to the defense. To discredit White, Dyke's lawyer called 
three inmates who testified that White told them he had made up the information 
on Dykes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Well, I'm Going Home' 
</P>
<P>
One of these inmates, informant Howard Stewart, testified: "I told him (White), 
'What you're doing is totally illegal.' He stated to me, 'Well, I'm going 
home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dykes' lawyer, Steven Hauser, said he is trying to reopen the case. He recently 
obtained a sworn statement from White that may help. 
</P>
<P>
White now says that both Battle and Williams "admitted to me that they "booked" 
Kevin Dykes for a crime that he did not commit." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, he said, "I am unfortunately and regretfully unable to provide 
all the facts to (the) court without a grant of immunity. . . . I do not want 
to be prosecuted for perjury." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
</P>
<P>
Booking -- Telling authorities about incriminating statements made by other 
inmates. This term applies whether the statements were real or not. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway time -- Time in which inmates are allowed to roam the corridor along 
the tier of cells in which they are housed. 
</P>
<P>
Getting In the Car -- Engaging in a communal effort to book someone. When one 
informant gets a piece of incriminating information, he will sometimes share or 
sell it to other informants, who can then claim that the suspect confessed to 
them too. The word "car" reflects the informants' hope that they will be 
rewarded with a ride home from jail. 
</P>
<P>
Informant Tank -- Tiers of cells where informants are ordinarily housed. When 
informants get into trouble in the tank, they are sometimes transferred to 
other protective custody units, where they encounter other "keep aways" -- 
including accused murderers whose cases have engendered lots of publicity. 
Informants also run into general population inmates on jail buses and in 
holding cells during trips to court. 
</P>
<P>
Juice Man -- An individual informant's chief contact in law enforcement. Often 
a police officer, but sometimes a prosecutor, a informant's juice man helps him 
disseminate his information to the detectives or prosecutors handling a 
specific case. The juice man also dispenses favors that can range from giving 
the informant a few dollars to helping arrange the informant's early release 
from jail. 
</P>
<P>
K-9 -- Los Angeles County jail designation for informants. The K stands for 
keep away, meaning informants are to be kept away from certain other inmates. 
The numerical designation is one of several, such as membership in a prison 
gang, or a propensity for violent behavior, that describes the reason for the 
keep away status.

YOUNG BASQUE SHEPHERDS NO LONGER FLOCK TO CALIF. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 100 years they have been coming to California and herding sheep, 
working interminable hours, rarely taking days off, enduring months of 
isolation in tents or primitive trailers. 
</P>
<P>
It was a job few Americans wanted. But for the young men in the mountainous 
Basque regions of Spain and France, shepherding was a way to parlay a few years 
of hard work into a better life. 
</P>
<P>
The Basques quickly developed an enduring reputation as the finest sheepmen in 
the American West. Basque shepherds had an uncanny ability to find the richest 
pastures, sheepmen said, rarely lost lambs to predators, and their ewes 
routinely had the most offspring. 
</P>
<P>
But during the 1970s, because of improved economic conditions in the Basque 
countries, immigration to America almost ceased. Sheepmen, once assured of a 
steady stream of young Basque men, were faced with a shepherd shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden things changed, and people in the sheep business couldn't find 
any shepherds," said Frank Iturriria, president of the Kern County Wool Growers 
Assn., who started as a shepherd when he immigrated to America 28 years ago. 
"Some people had to get out of the sheep business. Others switched over to 
cattle." 
</P>
<P>
The sheepmen eventually developed contacts in South America and began bringing 
in shepherds from Peru and Chile who were able to stay three years as guest 
workers and then return home. But for California's Basques, a way of life was 
unalterably transformed. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, 95% of the shepherds in Kern County -- the largest sheep 
county in the state -- were Basque, Iturriria said. Today, fewer than 10% are 
Basque, mostly aging men who have worked as shepherds for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The sheepmen lament the end of a tradition, the changing order of their 
business. Most young Basque men came to the United States with a few dollars in 
their pockets, worked as shepherds for a few years, received their pay in ewes 
and slowly amassed their own herds. 
</P>
<P>
In Kern County today, every large sheep ranch except one is owned by a Basque, 
and most of the owners began as sheepherders. But as they retire, young Basque 
men are not taking their places, and they fear that the tradition of the Basque 
sheepman will end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 44 and I'm the youngest sheepman in Kern County," said Frank Iturriria's 
brother, Antero, who also started as a shepherd. "The second generation of 
Basques in America don't want to go into the business. They want to be 
professional people. And the young Basques are staying home. What happens when 
I leave the business? Who will take my place?" 
</P>
<P>
At the edge of a pale-green alfalfa field speckled with hundreds of ewes and 
their newborn lambs wobbling about on unsteady legs, Elias Aleman mended a wire 
fence. It is the end of the winter lambing season in Kern County, and Aleman 
has to protect his sheep from speeding cars, a danger his flock never faced in 
the small Spanish town in the Pyrenees s where he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
"In my home village, there were no cars. . . . There weren't even many 
bicycles," he said in Basque, smiling shyly, as his employer, Frank Iturriria, 
interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
Because his hometown was so small -- about 300 people -- and isolated, Aleman 
said, there was little opportunity. But a Bakersfield sheepman visiting 
relatives in the Pyrenees offered him a job. So, at the age of 22, like most 
young men in his village, he moved to America. 
</P>
<P>
For 21 years Aleman has lived the lonely, nomadic life of a California 
shepherd. After the winter lambing, Aleman spends April and May in the Mojave 
Desert, watching his flock during spring grazing. He spends his summers on the 
mile-high meadows of the Owens Valley on the slopes of the Sierra. In the fall, 
he returns to the Kern County foothills. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Aleman and the other shepherds lived in tents and followed their 
flocks' peregrinations by foot over the century-old California Sheep Trail. It 
was one of the longest annual animal drives in the nation -- 400 miles over the 
Tehachapis to Mojave, up past Lone Pine and Bishop to the high mountain summer 
meadows of the Sierra and then back to Kern County. Now, the sheep are trucked 
to the seasonal grazing spots, and Aleman follows, pulling a battered trailer. 
</P>
<P>
But it is still a hard life, a life that young Basque men no longer are willing 
to endure, Aleman said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, this was our only opportunity," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman stooped over and picked a strip of foxtail grass. All was silent except 
for the ringing bell from a running ewe and the bleating of newborn lambs. 
"Today, in my home village, they all have cars now and can commute to 
factories. They no longer have to live this life." 
</P>
<P>
When the young men stopped coming to America, Basque neighborhoods in many 
California towns faced extinction. But Bakersfield's Basques have endured, and 
they have held onto a few remnants of their community. Basques are still 
scattered throughout the sheep-growing regions of the San Joaquin Valley, but 
the Bakersfield area has the largest community, with about 6,000 people of 
Basque descent. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Basque neighborhoods, Bakersfield's was founded near a railroad 
station. For generations, shepherds speaking no English arrived on the train, 
clutching scraps of paper bearing their destination, and walked to Basque 
boarding houses nearby and waited for sheepmen to give them work. 
</P>
<P>
The blocks around the Bakersfield Southern Pacific Railway station were once 
filled with Basque boarding houses and hotels, Basque restaurants, social halls 
and bakeries. Today, the Basque neighborhood is barely discernible. All that is 
left are a few aging restaurants, hotels and a bakery in an industrial section 
of town hard by the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handball and Card Games 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday the neighborhood is revived. After church, Basques line up 
outside the Pyrenees Bakery for the thick-crust, sourdough "shepherds loaf" for 
their Sunday meal. Others gather at the Basque Club for a game of pelota 
(Basque handball) or a card game called mus. By late afternoon, the bar at the 
Noriega Hotel is filled with sheepmen and the descendants of sheepmen drinking 
Picon punch, a heady blend of brandy, grenadine, soda and Amer Picon aperitif. 
</P>
<P>
The Noriega Hotel, a rooming house built in 1893, is the traditional center of 
Bakersfield's Basque community. A generation ago, it was filled with young men 
just off the train looking for work or shepherds spending their brief vacation 
in town. The rooming house provided three meals a day and free storage space 
while the shepherds were on the range. 
</P>
<P>
Many young Basque girls obtained their first jobs in America at the Noriega, 
and the hotel was the site of many marriages between chambermaids and visiting 
shepherds. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel still has eight boarders, including three retired Basque shepherds 
who now work as gardeners, said the current owner, Janize Elizalde. And the 
hotel still serves a traditional Basque meal at 7 p.m. sharp as boarders and 
visitors sit side by side at long wooden tables. The dim dining room and the 
ancient bar with a 
</P>
<P>
linoleum floor and creaky overhead fans provide a Spartan decor. 
</P>
<P>
Basque meals are famous for their plentitude, and no one ever walked away from 
Noriega's hungry. A recent meal included vegetable soup, Basque beans, pickled 
tongue, salad and Pyrenees bread for starters. The entrees were prime rib and 
lamb stew, served with heaping platters of French fries, spaghetti, cottage 
cheese and green beans. Dessert included large chunks of bleu cheese, followed 
by ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's and the seven other traditional Basque restaurants in the area 
attract tour groups and gourmands from throughout California. One of the 
Basques' greatest accomplishments is that they have managed to transform 
Bakersfield -- not considered one of California's cosmopolitan centers -- into 
a city known for its cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of the Basque sheepman in America began during the Gold Rush. But 
these first sheepmen were not from the Basque homeland; they were South 
American cattle ranchers of Basque descent who had decided to try their hand at 
gold mining. 
</P>
<P>
A few discovered that because of the great demand for fresh meat in the mining 
camps and the plentiful rangeland, they could make more money raising sheep 
than panning for gold. These Basques attracted other Basques, relatives and 
friends from the home villages in Spain and France, and soon there was a steady 
flow of shepherds to the sheep-growing regions of California, Nevada and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Basques are proud of their heritage and boast of having the oldest surviving 
culture in Europe. Although their homeland straddles the mountains between 
Spain and France, they do not consider themselves to be part of either country. 
They inhabited the Pyrenees long before Spain and France became nations. 
</P>
<P>
But opportunity was limited in the remote mountain villages, and by the turn of 
the century, Basques were pouring into the United States. They quickly adapted 
to the hard life of sheepherding and proved themselves "natural sheepmen," said 
Martin Etchamendy, a Kern County sheep ranch owner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Start 
</P>
<P>
"Basques have an ability around sheep we haven't found with any other people," 
said Etchamendy, who worked as a shepherd when he immigrated to America 27 
years ago. "For centuries, people have been raising sheep in the Pyrenees. 
Although not all Basques were shepherds in the old country, most had some sheep 
on their family farms. Ever since we were 4 or 5 years old we have been caring 
for the sheep, herding them, helping make cheese from their milk. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We adapted to the loneliness of sheepherding better than a lot of people 
because most of us are from very small villages with few neighbors. We grew up 
with the isolation." 
</P>
<P>
Etchamendy drove his pickup to a grazing field north of Bakersfield where his 
"No. 1 shepherd," Juan Maya, watched the flock. Maya, who looked like a figure 
from Biblical times, stood motionless for minutes, hunched over a wooden Basque 
shepherd's crook called a makila, silhouetted against the dying rays of the 
late afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been around sheep ever since he was born," Etchamendy said, flicking his 
head toward Maya, 61, who continued to stand motionless in the distance. "He is 
a man who really knows the character of sheep. Nobody has an eye like him." 
</P>
<P>
Maya knows how to quickly tie together the rear legs of twins so that the 
mother gets the smell of both and realizes she must nurse two instead of one. 
He knows how to match a twin whose mother does not have enough milk for two 
with an ewe who has lost a lamb after birth. He is an expert at skinning the 
dead lamb and placing the pelt over the back of the twin so that the ewe is 
fooled into thinking the lamb is her own. 
</P>
<P>
These are arcane skills that Basque shepherds take pride in but few Americans 
care to learn. Although Americans have mythologized every aspect of cattle 
ranching, few have paid any attention to the travails of the sheepman, said 
Larry Garro, director of the Western Range Assn., which locates foreign 
shepherds for local ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, for more than a century, the United States has imported its 
sheepmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in America wants to be a cowboy," Garro said. "But nobody wants to 
be a shepherd."

SCHOOL ERECTING 10-FOOT-HIGH WALL TO DEFLECT BULLETS

<P>
In an extraordinary attempt to protect teachers and students from flying 
bullets, Long Beach school administrators are erecting a 10-foot-high concrete 
wall alongside a junior high school, where recreation is periodically 
interrupted by the sound of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad that something like this has to be done," Lindbergh Jr. High 
School Principal Max Fraley said. "But it's needed in today's society." 
</P>
<P>
Physical education teachers at Lindbergh, where the recreation fields abut one 
side of a low-income housing project, say the 900-foot-long wall, is long 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of gunshots, mingled with the noise of children playing, average 
every six to eight weeks, according to teachers and students. Last week, 
students were evacuated from the fields twice after reports of nearby gunfire. 
Two years ago, in the only incident where someone was hurt, a student playing 
basketball after school was hit in the chest by a stray bullet and nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Got Angry' 
</P>
<P>
After a while, said physical education teacher Trish Ryan, "We got angry. This 
is ridiculous. This is enough, we said. We're taking our classes out there and 
we have to convince the kids that it's OK, when (we) are not sure it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the wall, which will cost $160,000 and will be financed by the 
school district and the county, is scheduled to begin this week. Once it is 
completed, Ryan said she will celebrate by hanging a sign on it that reads, 
"The Great Wall of Lindbergh." 
</P>
<P>
And that concept bothers some of the people who live on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
There are already three chain-link fences and a small flood-control channel 
separating the school from the 713-unit Carmelitos Housing Project, which is 
home to about 2,000 people. Some residents acknowledge that they have a crime 
problem, and they understand school officials' concerns. But many worry about 
the symbolism of the wall and argue that it will solve little in the fairly 
well-kept, color-coordinated complex where two-story homes have the look of 
moderately priced townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything for the safety of the kids," Carmelitos resident Ray Fox, 28, said. 
"But I think that $160,000 in law enforcement would do more to ease crime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Band-Aid' Solution 
</P>
<P>
Resident Rhonda Neal, 31, also argued that the money could be better spent. The 
district's solution is "like putting a Band-Aid on a deep wound." 
</P>
<P>
"They're keeping the people in Carmelitos in and the outside world away as if 
we were all bad guys," Neal said. "Overall, (the project) gets a bad rap. There 
are a lot of nice people who live in the project. There are a lot of 
intelligent people who live in the project. They're just poor." 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Don Field worked the North Long Beach area that includes Carmelitos 
for nine years. Yes, there is a crime problem, he said. But they have a bigger 
problem with their image, he continued. 
</P>
<P>
While Carmelitos experienced a 4.7% increase in the number of crimes reported 
in 1988 -- up from 341 in 1987 to 357 in 1988 -- the city had a 6.4% increase, 
according to Dwight Tompkins, the Police Department's senior crime analyst. 
Most of the crimes involved robbery and burglary, according to officials who 
could not provide a precise breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Bob Gillissie, who works in Chief Lawrence Binkley's office, said 
"we're there all the time" because of drugs and gang-related activities. But 
Gillissie said he could not characterize the area as one of the city's worst 
spots. "It's hard to say. It depends what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Diane McNeel, an official with the county's Community Development Commission, 
which oversees public housing, was not ambivalent when asked the same question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Face-Lift for Complex 
</P>
<P>
"It really has a lot more to do with perception than with reality," McNeel said 
of the residential community the county Housing Authority touts as a showplace. 
The county in recent years has pumped $24 million into Carmelitos, giving the 
sprawling complex a face-lift that includes a new community center and a new 
complex for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
McNeel questioned whether a wall is needed, saying: "The faculty at the junior 
high assumes when they hear a gunshot that it's coming from public housing." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach school board member Jerry Shultz, who said that someone shot at him 
with a BB gun while he was inspecting the school last fall, defended the wall 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than image. They have a problem," said Shultz, a Los Angeles County 
deputy sheriff. If the wall hurts people's feelings, he said, "so be it. What 
if a child gets killed? I'm willing to fight for a wall if it saves a child's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley C. Mitchell, chief of police for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, called the wall "a novel idea, but I don't know if it is the solution 
to the problem." Officials with the county Office of Education and the Los 
Angeles school system said they were unaware of any walls built at their 
schools for a similar purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disturbing Incidents 
</P>
<P>
Judy Wade, a physical education teacher at Lindbergh for 25 years, said that 
through the years she has seen beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed 
at students. But "now, it's not what they're throwing but what they're 
shooting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said her biggest scare came a few years ago when she spotted a man aiming 
his gun at her and her students from behind a tree. She quickly got everyone 
into the gymnasium. "I was scared," Wade said. "I felt, wow, I could be shot at 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Many students are also scared. Track team members Christine Vasquez and Emilie 
Wichert said that beer-toting men often hang out on the Carmelitos' side of the 
fence watching them run laps on the field after school. Mudy Ea, 15, said she 
too is glad that the wall is "finally going to be built." 
</P>
<P>
Carmelitos resident Dorothy McAleavey, who had four children graduate from 
Lindbergh, said she sympathizes with the school's teachers and students. But 
like others, she takes exception to the school's solution. "The whole idea of 
rehabbing Carmelitos was to open us up, to communicate with our neighbors," she 
said. "Now, they're walling us off."

DEFENSE CHIEF IN EGYPT IS MOVED ASIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak, in a mini-Cabinet shuffle widely seen as a move to 
consolidate his control over Egypt's military establishment, effectively 
dismissed his powerful defense minister Saturday by naming him to a heretofore 
ceremonial advisory post. 
</P>
<P>
A brief presidential decree said that Field Marshal Abdel-Halim abu Ghazala, 
Egypt's minister of defense for the past eight years and the principal 
architect of its close military relationship with the United States, had been 
appointed to the post of assistant president, a post that in the past has been 
associated with protocol and other largely ceremonial duties. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Youssef Sabri abu Taleb, a close ally of Mubarak's who for the past 
six years has served as the governor of Cairo, was named to succeed Abu Ghazala 
as defense minister in a separate presidential decree. 
</P>
<P>
While rumors of an impending Cabinet shuffle have been rife for weeks, Abu 
Ghazala's removal from the Defense Ministry sent a political shock wave through 
Egyptian government and military circles and took many foreign diplomats here 
by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Ghazala, 59, had been widely regarded as Mubarak's heir apparent and the 
second-most influential man in Egypt after the president himself. His departure 
from the most powerful ministry in Egypt thus also raised intriguing questions 
about the scenario for political succession of Washington's most important ally 
in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats cautioned that it may be premature to characterize Abu Ghazala's 
new appointment as a dismissal by noting other rumors that the defense minister 
would also be offered the vice presidency, a post that would make him Mubarak's 
constitutional successor. 
</P>
<P>
However, most diplomats and foreign military analysts here regarded the field 
marshal's appointment to the lesser post of assistant president as a stunning 
political demotion. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were going to name him vice president, they would have done it 
immediately. Everybody knows that once you become an assistant anything here, 
it's all over," said a Western military expert. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that no other Cabinet changes were announced also re-enforced the 
speculation that the appointment was not, in one diplomat's words, "intended to 
further Abu Ghazala's political career." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atef Sedki, whose job Abu Ghazala was reportedly offered but 
declined to accept last month, told reporters after the decrees were issued 
that the president decided to name the field marshal as his assistant because 
he "needs at his side someone to help him in the huge tasks he has to 
discharge." Sedki added that he did not expect any further Cabinet changes. 
</P>
<P>
Vacant for the past three years, the post of assistant president was last held 
by former Prime Minister Mamdouh Salem, whose main role was to represent the 
president at ceremonial functions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Ghazala was not immediately available for comment, but a source close to 
him said he did not know what the field marshal's new duties would be. 
"Everything is very vague right now. We don't know what he is going to do," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Ghazala, appointed defense minister by the late President Anwar Sadat, is 
one of only a small handful of ministers remaining from Mubarak's original 
Cabinet. His longevity at the Defense Ministry, however, is believed by most 
observers to be less a consequence of his at times testy relationship with the 
president than a function of his considerable skill in creating an independent 
power base as head of Egypt's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Through a combination of political acumen and extensive patronage, Abu Ghazala 
turned the Egyptian military establishment into a virtual empire unto itself, 
with an independent industrial, agricultural and service-oriented 
infrastructure that has helped to insulate the officer corps from the many 
economic vicissitudes of Egyptian life. 
</P>
<P>
The president has tried on several occasions to take Abu Ghazala away from all 
that by offering him the post of vice president, which has remained vacant 
since Mubarak succeeded Sadat upon the latter's assassination by Muslim 
extremists in October, 1981. Each time, however, the field marshal has 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Ties to Washington 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in Abu Ghazala's seemingly unassailable position has been his 
close relationship with Washington, where he served as military attache from 
1976 to 1979. A strong proponent of closer military ties to the United States, 
Abu Ghazala was frequently referred to as "Washington's man" in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the most interesting question raised by Saturday's Cabinet change was not 
why Mubarak sought to move his field marshal from the Defense Ministry but why 
he apparently felt he could do so now, when he has been unable to do so in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing they were basing their conclusions on speculation, several diplomats 
said they thought Mubarak finally may have moved against Abu Ghazala because of 
the many unproven but disturbingly persistent rumors of corruption that have 
come to be associated with his name. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that his name has also been linked, in a case that is soon to come to 
court in Sacramento, Calif., to an alleged Egyptian attempt to smuggle U.S. 
missile technology to Egypt, may also have been a factor in the president's 
decision, the diplomats speculated. 
</P>
<P>
"Abu Ghazala's close relationship with Washington has been an asset in the 
past, but if embarrassing revelations come out in court, he could turn into a 
liability as far as managing relations with the United States is concerned," 
one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts looked to Abu Taleb, the new defense minister, for clues about 
the motive behind the Cabinet shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
One Western envoy noted that Abu Taleb, 60, is considered to be "very close to 
Mubarak" and has earned a reputation both for honesty and efficiency as 
governor of Cairo.

KHOMEINI SUES 3 YUGOSLAVS UNDER 'PUBLIC HUMILIATION' LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has filed a criminal complaint against three 
Yugoslavs for criticizing his order that author Salman Rushdie be killed for 
writing "The Satanic Verses," a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed with the Belgrade district attorney's office under a 
section of the Yugoslav criminal code that forbids "public humiliation" of 
foreign countries or their leaders, the daily Borba reported Friday. The 
penalty for violating the law is up to three years imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the complaint was filed against Stanislav Marinkovic, editor 
of Borba; Vesna Roganovic, a journalist for the paper, and Slobodan Selenic, a 
popular Yugoslav author. 
</P>
<P>
Selenic, head of the Yugoslav Writers' Union, was sued because of a statement 
to Borba last month about "Khomeini's frightening threat" against Rushdie, the 
newspaper said. Marinkovic and Roganovic were cited for allowing the novel to 
be published, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Borba said several Yugoslav lawyers are representing Khomeini.

SYRIA-CHRISTIAN SHELLING DUELS KILL LEGISLATOR

<P>
A 72-year-old Christian legislator died Saturday when a rocket hit his 
apartment building during shelling duels between Syrian and Christian gunners, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Lebanese navy gunboat ferried 14 badly wounded Christians to a 
French naval vessel anchored off Beirut as a French humanitarian aid mission 
got under way. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the legislator, Louis abu Sharaf, was killed when a 
rocket landed near his apartment on the third floor of an eight-story building 
in Christian East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Sharaf was the first legislator to die in a shelling attack in Lebanon's 
15-year-old civil war. A member of the Christian Falangist Party, he had 
represented Christian Kesrouan province since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
His death raised to 23 the number of deputies who have died since the last 
parliamentary elections in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The war between Christians and Muslims has prevented parliamentary elections 
since then, and Abu Sharif's death reduced the number of deputies in the 
99-seat house to 75. 
</P>
<P>
Police said intermittent shelling duels intensified before sundown as gunners 
from both sides blasted Beirut and its surroundings, killing four people and 
wounding 31. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian tanker with a cargo of diesel oil, the Cochinella, was hit by a 
shell eight miles off Beirut on Saturday, an Italian Embassy official said. 
</P>
<P>
The French naval ship La Rance dropped anchor 10 miles off the Christian port 
of Juniyah, where France's minister for humanitarian aid, Bernard Kouchner, is 
supervising a mercy mission for both Christians and Muslims.

HITLER'S HOMETOWN IN A QUANDARY OVER MARKING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH

BRAUNAU, Austria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This pleasant town across the Inn River from the West German state of Bavaria 
has decidely mixed feelings about a monument established to commemorate the 
activities of its most famous native son. 
</P>
<P>
The burghers are not quite sure how they want to commemorate, on Thursday, the 
100th anniversary of the man who was born in the three-story house at No. 15 
Salzburg Vorstadt -- Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of World War II, most Braunauers would just as soon forget that 
Hitler was born here -- in effect subscribing to the adage that Austria has 
managed to convince the world that German-born Beethoven was Austrian and 
Hitler was German. None of the tourist brochures describing the attractive 
community of 16,000 mentions the German dictator, who committed suicide in 1945 
in his bunker in war-ravaged Berlin just 10 days after his 56th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Away as Infant 
</P>
<P>
But Hitler did come from here and Mayor Gerhard Skiba, a Socialist, has chosen 
to remind the world of that fact -- in a rather oblique way -- with a 
three-foot chunk of stone outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
An inscription chiseled on the granite from the quarry at the former Mauthausen 
concentration camp mentions neither Hitler nor the house but reads: 
</P>
<P>
 For Peace, Freedom and Democracy 
</P>
<P>
Never Again Fascism 
</P>
<P>
In Memory of the Millions of Dead. 
</P>
<P>
Skiba said: "As mayor, I have decided to erect a monument and reminder in front 
of Adolf Hitler's birthplace as a clear and open sign as to the way we in 
Braunau think about the past and remember the victims of fascism. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20th of April was in the past, and is in the present, a date which brings 
with it a particular meaning for our city -- through no fault of the citizens 
of Braunau." 
</P>
<P>
Skiba said the text "serves as a reminder, as a declaration and call to work 
against budding neo-Nazism and other obvious dangers to democracy." 
</P>
<P>
But other citizens say that Skiba is calling undeserved attention to Braunau's 
past, and they worry that the monument itself will attract neo-Nazis from 
Austria and Germany. Harald Klinger, district commissioner for the Braunau 
area, has received reports that neo-Nazis and others sympathetic to Hitler will 
gather here on April 20 to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to reckon with violence," Klinger said. "We have to hope and pray 
no one gets killed. This could well be the last big anniversary here, but if 
there is a martyr we will have the same circus every year." 
</P>
<P>
The stone memorial outside the house, which is now used as a craft school for 
handicapped children, has become a magnet for snapshot-taking tourists, who 
might otherwise not have noticed the building just 50 yards from the city's 
main square. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that, according to historians, Hitler never much cared for his 
birthplace. The family left when he was 3, first to Passau in 1892 and then in 
1895 to Linz, which Hitler regarded as his hometown. Hitler on several 
occasions said he remembered nothing about Braunau. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returned Only Once 
</P>
<P>
The dictator came back only once, with German troops who annexed Austria in 
1938, and though the town staunchly supported the anschluss, or union, with 
Germany and made him an honorary citizen, Hitler never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Local historians point out that the name "Schicklgruber," which British leader 
Winston Churchill, among others, used to call the Fuehrer, resulted because his 
maternal grandmother, Maria Ann Schicklgruber, bore a child out of wedlock who 
was later given a step-uncle's name and became Hitler's father, Alois 
Schicklgruber. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the buff-and-white building at No. 15, which could stand a coat of 
paint, director Kurt Hell showed a visitor the brightly colored tapestries made 
by the children and said he did not know when the house was built. But he 
pointed out old wooden staircases and stone floors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attention a Nuisance 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody seemed to notice us before -- just the occasional tourist -- but now 
all the attention is getting to be a nuisance. We're trying to teach 
handicapped children. Actually, nobody knows what room Hitler was born in 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, townspeople said that the owner of the house, who rents it out, 
objected to a commemorative plaque being embedded in the wall -- and that is 
why Skiba placed the stone monument on the city street, next to a row of angled 
parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nearby shopkeepers expressed indifference to the new stone marker, 
but one worker said: "I just don't like the look of it. I think it's ugly." 
</P>
<P>
A bookseller added: "All this is for the history books. I don't know why the 
mayor thought a marker was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
And another Braunauer commented, "Hitler was born an Austrian but he became a 
German." 
</P>
<P>
All around Braunau are reminders of the war, including a cemetery with World 
War I and World War II dead just outside of town. And the crypt of St. 
Stephen's Church, a 15th-Century building, bears the names of local residents 
who died in both wars. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler's name is missing, said Father Stefan Hofer, the parish priest, because 
he was not inducted into the army from Braunau. 
</P>
<P>
The priest said, "I think the inscription should have said, 'No more 
dictatorship,' rather than referring only to fascism. I really don't think it 
is fair to single out Braunau, since Hitler only lived here as an infant." 
</P>
<P>
Would the Hitler reminder be good or bad for Braunau? 
</P>
<P>
"We will see," said Father Hofer. 
</P>
<P>
And provincial official Klinger, looking uneasily toward April 20, cautioned: 
"The eyes of the world will be on us. The reputation of Austria is at stake."

The shouting started in Pakistan's modern National Assembly hall the moment the 
Islamic priest finished chanting the prayer that opened the evening session. 
</P>
<P>
The subject at issue: democracy and dynasty under Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you call this a democracy?" cried an opposition member, Chaudhry 
Shujaat, as his colleagues thumped their desks in approval. "You are violating 
traditions which are observed by democratic nations throughout the world. There 
can be no democracy without checks on government power." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the newly reconstituted National Assembly were incensed by the prime 
minister's appointment of her father-in-law, Hakim Ali Zardari, as chairman of 
the legislative committee that serves as watch-dog over government spending. 
</P>
<P>
"In a democracy, it is the right of the opposition to head the Public Accounts 
Committee," Shujaat said. "The government's expenditures must be checked." 
</P>
<P>
As the presiding officer shouted for order, Bhutto's parliamentary minister, 
Tariq Rahim, said: "Rules are rules. Traditions are traditions. And in this 
country, the tradition of the previous government was that the chairman of this 
committee was from the government." 
</P>
<P>
True, Bhutto's critics responded, but the previous government was a 
dictatorship. And worse, they said, Bhutto appointed her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, 
to a Cabinet post equivalent to deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
All this has raised charges that the Bhuttos, who had been out of power since 
Benazir's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was executed after a 
military coup in 1977, are trying to build a political dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
One opposition member, Umar Hayat Lalika, wryly suggested from the assembly 
floor recently that the prime minister might want to appoint her infant son, 
Bilawal, "minister of children's affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's defenders, still in the majority five months after her dramatic 
election victory, say there is no difference between what Bhutto is doing and 
what President John F. Kennedy did. Kennedy named his brother, Robert, attorney 
general and helped chart the career of their brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
"This government remains firmly committed to democracy and its traditions," 
Rahim declared. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Bhutto, 35, point to the fact that the opposition can air its 
complaints openly on the legislative floor as proof that democracy is alive and 
well in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a rebirth of democracy in Pakistan, but it remains in its infancy," 
said Jane Ann Lindley, an American consultant to Pakistan's National Assembly, 
who has spent 2 1/2 years in Islamabad helping the government rebuild its 
legislative institutions. "The infant has been born, but it has to go through 
the stage of a toddler before it gets on its own two feet and functions." 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats and independent Pakistani analysts are not so sure. They see 
growing signs of corruption and patronage, and they complain that Bhutto's 
government has been so obsessed with political gamesmanship that it has failed 
to govern. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem everyone is talking about is corruption and patronage," said 
Omar Asghar Khan, a Pakistani economic consultant. "People are talking about 
Benazir's husband, Asif Zardari, about land speculation, about government 
contracts, about the appointment of senior party people to key posts, and about 
the going price of a government job. The rumor is that for 300,000 rupees 
(about $15,000), you can get a post in the new government. People are getting 
more and more uneasy." 
</P>
<P>
And a Western diplomat commented: "Thoughtful Pakistanis are beginning to 
wonder about the presence of a lot of people Benazir brought back from her 
father's time. There is a lot of talk about dynasty-building and a return to 
the political gamesmanship from the time of Benazir's father." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and its principal 
opposition, the Islamic Democratic Alliance, came to a head late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto party workers in the opposition-held province of Punjab, the wealthiest 
of Pakistan's four provinces, had been trying to get the provincial legislature 
to unseat the opposition alliance headed by Mian Nawaz Sharif, a 35-year-old 
millionaire businessman, with a vote of no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
But the strategy backfired when Sharif won a resounding victory. The incident 
was seen as a serious political misstep by Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to many thoughtful Pakistanis that this political battle has 
preoccupied Benazir's government to the point where her government has failed 
to govern and the legislature has failed to legislate," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindley, who has spent 22 years with the Library of Congress and is a 
consultant to nine other Asian parliamentary governments, regards the criticism 
as premature and unfair, as do many Pakistanis. 
</P>
<P>
"When a country has had a fairly repressive regime for such a long time, there 
is a lot of pent-up emotion," said Lindley, who came to Pakistan to oversee the 
building of a new library for the National Assembly but whose mission expanded 
to include helping rebuild the institution itself. "There is a lot of naivete 
among the politicians, because they haven't been able to practice politics. And 
there needs to be a lot of talking and letting off of steam and having this 
free flow of discussion before the institution actually takes shape." 
</P>
<P>
For Lindley and others, the 11 years of dictatorship under President Zia 
ul-Haq, who was killed in a mysterious air crash last August, is the key to 
understanding the first few months of Bhutto's rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that they've had 11 years of unrepresentative government," Lindley said, 
"the first obligation of the new legislators is to give vent to the people's 
hostility and points of view. It'll take five or six months just to hear what 
the people have to say. If you've had 11 years of unrepresentative government, 
what is 100 days? To me, that's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
But for political analysts, the debate over patronage and alleged dynasty 
building is critical to measuring the growth of democracy under Pakistan's 
youngest-ever prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
"When the winner takes all, democracy ceases to function, and the parliamentary 
minorities are the key to preventing this," said Ijaz Gilani, director of 
Gallup Pakistan, referring to the debate over appointment of Bhutto's 
father-in-law to the accounting post. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is a system that is designed, not as the rule of the majority, but 
as one that will protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority," said 
Gilani, a professional pollster trained at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. "And unless you bring the opposition members into the mainstream, 
democracy is unlikely to last for very long."

Italian Jews were allowed to take Saturday off under a decree by the Interior 
Ministry recognizing Jewish religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The decree, published Thursday, says Jews who work in the public or private 
sector as well as those in the military and civil service do not have to work 
on their religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Jews who take Saturday off will in most cases have to work on Sunday or put in 
extra hours on other days. 
</P>
<P>
Many Italians employed in the public sector work a six-day week that includes 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The decree also instructs schools to keep in mind the Jewish Sabbath when 
scheduling examinations since Jewish students do not have to attend classes on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The decree was the result of talks between the Italian government and the 
country's Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 40,000 Jews in Italy, where the population of about 57 million 
is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

25 CHARGED IN FRANCE WITH RUNNING FRAUD RING MAKING BORDEAUX WINE

<P>
Twenty-five people were being questioned Saturday after police broke up a fraud 
ring involving some of France's finest Bordeaux wine, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They refused to name any of the people being held, but police sources said 
major wine producers were involved. The arrests were made on Thursday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the region's finest wines, such as Saint Emilion, Montbazillac, 
Bergerac and Cahors, were affected, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 under arrest are accused of producing more vintage wine than the law 
allows and selling it illegally to stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the wine was kept in secret reservoirs, bottled and taken to shops 
and restaurants. The wine was correctly labeled and buyers had no idea the 
sales were illegal, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Production of vintage wines, or grands crus, is limited by law to maintain 
standards, but modern techniques mean that growers often produce double the 
amount they are allowed to sell. 
</P>
<P>
The surplus is supposed to be sold as table wine or turned into industrial 
alcohol, incurring a large financial loss compared to the profits that can be 
made on the sale of a bottle of vintage wine.

SRI LANKA REBELS OFFER TALKS WITH REGIME ON ENDING WAR

<P>
Tamil rebels offered Saturday to hold talks with the Sri Lankan government on 
ending their war for independence. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was made public hours after a jungle ambush blamed on the rebels left 
21 soldiers dead. It was the third attack blamed on the rebels in as many days. 
At least 79 people have died in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most powerful Tamil rebel 
group, sent a letter to President Ranasinghe Premadasa offering to hold talks, 
a spokesman for the organization said. Copies of the letter, signed by the 
group's political committee, were sent to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was an apparent response to Premadasa's recent call for a cease-fire. 
A spokesman for the president called the Tamil statement a "major 
breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
The last talks between the Tigers and the government were held in 1985 in 
Thimpu, Bhutan. The negotiations ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Tamil Tigers said in Colombo that he would meet with Premadasa 
to discuss arrangements for the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, account for 18% of Sri Lanka's 16 million 
people. They complain that they are discriminated against in jobs and education 
by the majority Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists and who make up 75% of the 
population. Most of the rest are Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's jungle ambush occurred near Parakramapura, a village about 150 miles 
northeast of Colombo, where soldiers were guarding Sinhalese laborers clearing 
the forest, military officials in Colombo said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 21 soldiers were killed and four laborers were critically injured in 
the fighting, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, at least 12 people were killed and 18 others injured in the 
Tamil-dominated town of Jaffna, 180 miles north of Colombo, when a car bomb 
exploded near the town's university. Military officials in Colombo said the 
bomb was intended for soldiers in a small camp nearby and exploded prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a car bomb in the port city of Trincomalee killed 45 people, 
mostly members of the Sinhalese ethnic majority. 
</P>
<P>
That explosion came a day after security forces began a weeklong unilateral 
cease-fire in an effort to persuade both rebels of the Tamil minority and 
militant members of the Sinhalese majority to stop fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups of radicals rejected the cease-fire proposal.

Fire roared through a two-story home converted into four apartments in 
Koreatown early Saturday, causing $443,000 in damage and leaving 37 people 
homeless, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 37 residents were injured. They were taken by Rapid Transit 
District bus to an emergency shelter at Berendo Junior High School, Red Cross 
spokesman Anthony Greno said. He said the shelter would remain open through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those displaced by the blaze were women and children, Greno said. Red 
Cross workers immediately ordered hamburgers from a fast-food restaurant to 
feed the hungry group. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 2:10 a.m. at 1420 S. New Hampshire Ave. by two RTD 
police officers who were on their way to another call when they saw smoke, 
firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 firefighters assigned to nine companies extinguished the blaze in 39 
minutes, Fire Department spokesman Jim Williamson said.

THE CONFESSION TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
2 CASES APPEAR TO VIOLATE D.A. RULES ON USE OF JAIL INFORMANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH and ROBERT W. STEWART, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of Leslie White's demonstration last fall that he could fake 
another jail inmate's murder confession, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner moved quickly to tighten his office's standards for using jailhouse 
informants. 
</P>
<P>
However, five months later, the spirit of Reiner's tougher standards appears to 
have been violated in two cases and the standards themselves remain largely 
undefined. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to concern among defense lawyers that the potential remains for 
jailhouse informants to fake confessions. 
</P>
<P>
Leading defense lawyer organizations, including the California Attorneys for 
Criminal Justice and the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Bar Assn., have decided to 
campaign for state legislation that would prohibit law enforcement agencies 
from giving the rewards that informants say encourage them to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Toughen Standard 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), the legislation would 
also require a corroboration standard similar to Reiner's for informant 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, authorities have considered an informant's account corroborated 
if they could show that he was together with the suspect in jail and reported 
facts about the crime that should have been known only by the criminal. 
</P>
<P>
White, however, showed that he could feign having talked to the criminal, and 
gather his inside information about the crime from law enforcement agencies by 
posing as a law enforcement agent on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that White had proven traditional standards of corroboration 
unreliable, Reiner had his chief deputy issue a directive on Nov. 17, requiring 
"concrete evidence" that the defendant had actually given the reported 
confession to the informant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Types of Evidence 
</P>
<P>
The directive cited tape recordings and handwritten admissions as examples of 
"concrete evidence," but said there were other types of unspecified evidence 
that would also qualify. 
</P>
<P>
To define what this other evidence can be, Reiner is requiring a handful of his 
most senior executives to unanimously endorse what constitutes sufficient 
corroboration in an individual case. 
</P>
<P>
Before the White episode, any of the office's 800 prosecutors could decide on 
his own whether to use an informant. 
</P>
<P>
So far, these senior officials have formally reviewed six requests to use 
informants in court, and have approved three. Approval of a fourth is expected 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
An undetermined number of other requests have been turned down informally, 
senior officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Appear Clear-Cut 
</P>
<P>
Two of the cases appear clear-cut under the new "concrete evidence" standard. 
</P>
<P>
One involved a purported handwritten admission in the form of a detailed map of 
a defendant's house, where a young woman had been stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant allegedly gave the map to the informant, who was a law school 
graduate, while asking the informant for help in formulating a defense to the 
murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
The legend to the map included incriminating statements such as "where she sat 
. . . where I sat . . . where the body fell." 
</P>
<P>
Another, which is expected to be approved, is a tape-recorded solicitation to 
murder law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
But in two other homicide cases involving confessions provided by jailhouse 
informants, the approvals appear to violate the spirit of the requirement for 
"concrete" corroboration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For a Different Crime 
</P>
<P>
In one of these, the only concrete corroboration was for a different crime, a 
burglary of the deceased's residence that the informant himself committed. 
</P>
<P>
In the other, an informant appeared to meet the requirement by providing 
information that had not been previously known to the police. However, this 
information implicated only one of two defendants that the informant claimed to 
have overheard making incriminating statements. The informant testified against 
both in a trial that ended with a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi Gordon, a defense lawyer and spokeswoman for defense attorneys on the 
informant issue, predicts that "exceptions will soon swallow the (concrete 
evidence) rule. . . . We'll be right back where we started." 
</P>
<P>
However, the corroboration standard outlined in the legislation proposed by the 
defense bar is even more vague than the standard set by Reiner. The legislation 
states that an informant's testimony can only be used if "it is corroborated by 
other evidence demonstrating that the statements testified to were actually 
made by the defendant." It cites no examples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally Different Views 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the disagreement between the defense lawyers and the district 
attorney's office on the credibility of informants turns on their fundamentally 
different views of what life is like in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people find it somewhat incredible . . . that people in jail actually 
talk about their crimes," Reiner said in a recent interview. "Most people who 
have no exposure to that world would think, 'Good God, If I ever committed a 
crime and I was in jail, I wouldn't talk to anybody. My lips would be sealed. . 
. .' The fact is . . . in jail, people are always talking about their crimes. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"There are people in jail who keep their ears open," Reiner added. "As a matter 
of good public policy, you can't turn a deaf ear to information that people 
bring to you." 
</P>
<P>
However, Leslie Abramson, president of California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, has a diametrically opposed view. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that . . . someone, upon meeting a perfect stranger, would confess 
to him is absurd, and not worthy of belief," she said in an interview. "To 
persist in this fiction that it does happen by using jailhouse informants is to 
knowingly or winkingly foster perjury." 
</P>
<P>
While this debate goes on, so does the district attorney's review of criminal 
cases in which jailhouse informants have testified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identify 200 Defendants 
</P>
<P>
So far, the district attorney's office and the defense bar have identified 
cases in which informants testified against more than 200 defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court has agreed to appoint attorneys at public expense to 
represent convicted defendants who wish to try to reopen their cases by 
challenging informant testimony. Meanwhile, the state attorney general's office 
has agreed to supply the Los Angeles County Grand Jury with a special counsel 
to investigate the use of jailhouse informants.

SOME SENIORS HAVE TIME OF THEIR LIVES AT EXPO

Lean, tan, blond, and 25, Jill Fulton was standing between the laxative 
salesman and the massaging pillow display and looking a little confused. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was the Whole Life Expo," she said, referring to the popular 
convention of health and fitness services that annually draws a young Southern 
California crowd. "But we kind of fell into the older sector." 
</P>
<P>
Fulton and her equally young, equally tan, equally fit companion had mistakenly 
wandered into just that -- an exposition that drew more than 12,000 people 
older than 50 to the Los Angeles Convention Center on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
There was tap dancer Arthur Duncan doing a number he called "The Geritol 
Strut." There were Tofu salesmen and Kraft cheese-ball peddlers. There were 
demonstrations of aerobics you can do without leaving your chair and there were 
bowling lanes, trampolines and bicycles built for two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousands Attend 
</P>
<P>
Amid it all wandered thousands of older people. They were on foot, in 
wheelchairs, aided by canes and younger friends. They were well aware of the 
lengths marketing people had gone to try to sell them practically everything. 
And they were enjoying every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
The event was the "Time of Your Life Expo," a weekend-long sales pitch of more 
than 400 products targeted to older adults. The number of such products and 
services is growing rapidly as the group once derisively called "old geezers" 
becomes America's fastest growing market. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 28 million people older than 65 in the United States today. 
By the year 2000 it is estimated that 25% of the country's population will be 
senior citizens, more than double today's percentage. The seniors are living 
longer and buying more and, as this weekend's exposition attests, there is 
plenty around for them to buy. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, Mary Daigle and her friend, Evelyn Brady, skunked them. They 
said they had sampled three different kinds of juices, two pizzas, ice milk, 
frozen yogurt and liquid laxatives at booths around the Convention Center floor 
and hadn't bought a thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've probably tasted a million things," chuckled Daigle, 81, clutching three 
bags filled with product samples and the remains of a piece of oat and honey 
bread. "We didn't even need to buy lunch. We managed pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Not everything at the exposition was for sale, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers from the American Red Cross offered free blood-pressure checks, 
cholesterol-level evaluations and glucose-tolerance tests. The Peace Corps was 
looking for a few good men and women. The National Orthotics Foundation was 
teaching good foot care. Political groups, environmental groups and social 
groups were busy recruiting members. 
</P>
<P>
For Jill Fulton, the afternoon was not wasted. The expo made her realize that 
she won't be young forever. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you realize, this is going to happen," she said. "We're planning 
ahead."

CAMBODIAN FETE CELEBRATES START OF YEAR OF THE SNAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Amid offerings of curried beef, incense and bananas, San Diego's Cambodian 
community celebrated the start of the Year of the Snake on Saturday, ending 
three days of prayer with an all-day program of song, food and traditional 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people crowded into the Colina Del Sol Park and Recreation Center 
in East San Diego to pay respects to their ancestors, exchange gossip and show 
off their brightly colored sampot, shimmering wraparound skirts worn by men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Children ran screeching through the center, while their parents offered up 
everything from rice and tomatoes to soda pop and toilet paper for the 
saffron-robed monks who led the ceremony with prayers for a prosperous new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Family Gatherings 
</P>
<P>
But for many Cambodians, the New Year celebration is necessarily intertwined 
with the political situation in their homeland because the national holiday is 
a time for family gatherings, visiting relatives and commemorating ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, we do this to bring luck and happiness," said Ouch Lim Heng, 
president of the Cambodian Buddhist Assn. (also known as the Sovann Kiry 
Buddhist Society), which helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We light candles, we give bananas, apples and pears. . . . It grows a little 
every year," said Ouch, resplendent in a starched white military-style jacket 
with epaulets and gold buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Kok Neet, 48, another association member, said, "I really enjoy this. . . . We 
believe each year a fairy or God or angel saves the people." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of each year an astrologer envisions an angel in a particular 
pose. The image spreads through San Diego's 6,000- to 7,000-member Cambodian 
community by word of mouth and announcements in Cambodian-language newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the angel sits on an elephant, with a gun or weapon in her right 
hand and a cane in her left. She sleeps with her eyes open and eats soybean and 
sesame seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Sokennedy Pen, a counselor at the Union of Pan-Asian Communities, a 
multiservice agency serving San Diego's Indochinese refugee population, said 
the gun and cane symbolize a country handicapped by fighting among three 
resistance factions in anticipation of a withdrawal by Vietnamese troops later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"(This) vision is bad," Pen said. "We usually produce rice in our country. The 
sesame seed means starvation." 
</P>
<P>
But the angel's eyes are open, Pen said, 
</P>
<P>
and that means there is still hope. 
</P>
<P>
Community storyteller Chhim Sem, 69, sat before the blue and red flag of a 
united, independent Cambodia and said he is hopeful that Cambodia will have 
itsindependence in the Year of the Snake. 
</P>
<P>
"I have sorrow inside, but I am showing happiness. I expect Cambodian 
resolution this year, but seeing all these people together reminds me of my own 
family members still in camps on the (Cambodia-Thailand) border." 
</P>
<P>
Changes in international refugee policy have resulted in a decrease of 
Cambodian refugees coming to the United States, making family reunification 
nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Kung Chap, a state Department of Rehabilitation counselor in Long Beach, said 
one of his clients went to a local temple for the New Year celebrations "and 
when she saw all the husbands and wives and families together, paying respects, 
she cried and cried and cried and thought about suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"She has no family here, she's lonely and by herself. Her husband and child 
were killed by the Khmer Rouge. She went to the cemetery that night and started 
drinking," Chap said. 
</P>
<P>
For others, the New Year celebration becomes an important lesson in tradition. 
</P>
<P>
With fewer Cambodians arriving and with the assimilation of newer generations, 
many say sustaining the Cambodian culture is at risk. New Year's is one way to 
get young people interested in their country's customs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, no matter what, this is an important event," said Prom Khean, a 
monk. "Even those who are Americanized will come here before going elsewhere. 
"Every year, we keep doing it as a big event so the children will not lose 
interest, so they will not think we have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's festivities included a beauty pageant and a raffle tree sprinkled 
with silver pieces of paper. People gave dollar bills for a piece of paper, 
which were then traded for balloons, canned fruit, candy, toothpaste, soap and 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
Classical dances and a running commentary of stories, poems, prayers and 
general well-wishing accompanied the eating and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, we still have today," Chhim said. "We try to explain the culture over 
and over, we try to show them to make sure they remember." 
</P>
<P>
Vanna Soeng, 28, was on hand to pay respects to her late parents and 
grandparents. Praying with her 2-year-old daughter, Somarly, beside her, Soeng 
said she would teach her all of the Cambodian customs. But she doesn't know 
what will happen when Somarly grows up. 
</P>
<P>
"If she's old enough, she will do what she wants to. . . . It's up to her." 
</P>
<P>
Chantha Khoeun, an 18-year-old San Diego High School student, is not allowed to 
date and does not go out at night. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents expect me to be like a Cambodian, to speak the language more often, 
. . . but I know some of it. I'll teach it to my children." 
</P>
<P>
Chhim's daughter, Sonnary, 15, is a student a Roosevelt Junior High in North 
Park but said she would be willing to return to Cambodia permanently. She knows 
the "Wishing Dance" -- which she performs every New Year's -- by heart. 
</P>
<P>
"This means a lot to me because I can get a new beginning and wash away the bad 
things. I can wish well to relatives that passed away. I really believe in it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 Holidays a Year 
</P>
<P>
Ton Chimvorn, an assessment counselor for the United Cambodian Community Inc., 
in Santa Ana, said Cambodians celebrate about seven holidays a year. 
</P>
<P>
"But New Year's is the big one. It's very special. We meet, we play, we forget 
the troubles in the past and reach out for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time for the family to meet together. We bless everything, and we pray 
that in the future, we'll meet our brothers and sisters and relatives again."

NEW LAW AIDS PROSECUTION OF SILBERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS BROADENED SCOPE OF 'STING' MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent tightening of federal laws prohibiting money laundering is expected 
to give the government a significant advantage in prosecuting prominent San 
Diego businessman Richard T. Silberman and others charged with conspiring to 
disguise funds they allegedly believed came from drug traffickers, attorneys 
familiar with such cases say. 
</P>
<P>
The change, adopted by Congress in November, makes it illegal to conduct a 
financial transaction with money portrayed as proceeds of illegal activity -- 
even if the funds involved actually are federal money used by government agents 
in an undercover "sting." 
</P>
<P>
Although few, if any, cases have been tried under the new provision, some 
defense attorneys believe they will now have a tougher time clearing clients 
accused in money-laundering schemes -- particularly if the FBI has wiretapped 
conversations or other proof showing a defendant thought he was dealing in 
"dirty" money. 
</P>
<P>
One lawyer, summarizing the defense bar's collective sentiment on the newly 
toughened law, complained that the change gave federal agents "carte blanche" 
to set up stings to "manipulate people into breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
"This has given the government the power to create an artificial world to test 
the virtue of whomever they elect to target," said San Diego attorney Eugene G. 
Iredale, a veteran of many money-laundering cases. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, argue that Congress had merely sewn shut a gaping 
loophole in the law that hindered their efforts to convict money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'... a Dirty State of Mind' 
</P>
<P>
"The gist of it is, people who believe they are laundering money should be 
punished," said Assistant U. S. Atty. Gordon Greenberg, chief of the financial 
investigations unit in Los Angeles. "Whether the government says it is dirty 
money or it is in fact dirty money doesn't change the state of mind of the 
defendant. The bottom line is, the defendant has a dirty state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 59, was arrested April 7 at a San Diego hotel, allegedly while 
negotiating with an undercover agent to launder $1.1 million the agent told him 
were profits from Colombian cocaine trafficking. Also arrested was Chris Petti, 
62, a reputed organized-crime figure who allegedly acted as a middleman linking 
Silberman with the undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Silberman, a powerful fund-raiser for local and 
statewide Democratic candidates, conspired with Petti and two Los Angeles 
County men -- Darryl Nakatsuka, 42, and Jack Myers, 43 -- to launder a total of 
$300,000 during two transactions in November and February. All but Petti, who 
was ordered held without bail Thursday, are free on bail and awaiting a 
preliminary hearing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI affidavit says that Silberman, who is married to county Supervisor Susan 
Golding, last year asked his longtime acquaintance Petti to drum up some 
money-laundering business for him. FBI agents came upon Silberman during their 
2 1/2-year investigation of Petti, who allegedly has ties to the Cosa Nostra 
crime family of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said recent changes in federal laws aimed at money launderers will 
make obtaining convictions in cases like the one embroiling Silberman markedly 
easier. Indeed, until three years ago, there were no statutes specifically 
calling money laundering a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1986, there were "exceedingly hypertechnical requirements necessary to 
prove a money-laundering case," said San Diego Asst. U. S. Atty. Phillip L. 
Halpern. The tool most commonly used to convict money launderers in that era 
was one requiring the filing of a currency transaction report (CTR) for 
financial deals involving sums exceeding $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraught With Problems 
</P>
<P>
But that approach was fraught with problems. "It was a much more convoluted, 
difficult method of bringing these prosecutions," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, a cunning mover of dirty money could find ways around the 
requirements. Many launderers simply broke their transactions down into sums 
under $10,000, while others filed false reports or used complex investment 
tools -- like multilayered stock swaps -- difficult for the government to 
track, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, a smart guy would go to a bank and give one teller $9,900, then 
go to another teller with another $9,900," Halpern said. "There were a lot of 
ways to get around this." 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a launderer was nabbed and charged under the CTR statute, his 
conviction was by no means assured. Although there were some victories in cases 
at the district-court level, there was a split on the issue among the federal 
appellate courts nationwide, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overturned Convictions 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, some courts -- including the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- 
overturned some convictions on grounds that the duty of filing the CTRs was on 
the bank, not the customer, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"So what the customer did -- absent collusion by the bank -- wasn't illegal," 
said Greenberg, who watched in dismay as many convictions he won in the lower 
courts were voided by the 9th Circuit justices. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, I had the dubious distinction of losing more cases before the 9th 
Circuit than any other prosecutor in the history of man," Greenberg recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, however, Congress passed the sweeping Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. 
That legislation prohibited the structuring of a financial transaction 
deliberately to avoid a reporting requirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed New Law 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers went further, however, by passing a law aimed straight at money 
laundering. The statute makes it illegal to accept funds known to have come 
from "specified illegal activities" and to attempt to promote that illegal 
activity or conceal the money's "nature, location, source, ownership or 
control." 
</P>
<P>
"That was a tremendous help," said Halpern, who prosecuted the first 
money-laundering case brought under the 1986 law in San Diego. "It is very, 
very broad because a transaction is defined in the statute as moving money by 
just about any means." 
</P>
<P>
For example, "if you sell a used car to disguise the proceeds of specified 
illegal activity or to further that illegal activity, you're guilty," Halpern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
(The law was so broad, it initially struck fear in the hearts of criminal 
defense attorneys, who feared they could be prosecuted if they accepted money 
of suspect origin from a client. Congress amended the statute to exclude 
attorney's fees.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Firepower 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Congress gave federal prosecutors still more firepower in their 
war against those suspected of bankrolling the narcotics trade. 
</P>
<P>
Under this newest amendment, a money launderer can be convicted even if the 
funds he handled were provided by the FBI in an undercover investigation. The 
change allowed government agents wider latitude in constructing stings to snare 
those seeking to "cleanse" dirty money through often untraceable investments. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to that, we'd do stings but we wouldn't use federal money," Greenberg 
said. "We'd have to set up large undercover shops and wait for the defendants 
to bring their money in." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said adoption of that change was spurred in part by a case involving 
former Georgia Rep. Pat Swindall, who was charged with money laundering after 
he agreed to accept an $850,000 home construction loan from an undercover agent 
posing as a representative of underworld figures. Because the money involved 
was not truly "dirty" money, Swindall's prosecution was viewed as frail. The 
charges were later reduced to perjury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imaginary Operation 
</P>
<P>
"The defense in Swindall was to be that the whole thing was an imaginary FBI 
operation and so he couldn't be laundering money because the money was clean," 
said Los Angeles attorney Terry Scott, who works with Barry Tarlow, the noted 
lawyer hired to represent Myers in the San Diego case. "The funny thing is, we 
will never know whether that defense would have worked because the government's 
fears (that it would) limited the subsequent indictment to perjury." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argue that the recent change gave government agents excessive 
authority to engage in stings designed to lure innocent people into committing 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave the FBI unlimited power to set people up," Iredale said. "It permits 
the government to dangle huge sums of money in front of people having financial 
problems and create an artificial situation that would never exist in reality. 
They wind up prosecuting people who, but for the sting operation, would never 
have violated the law." 
</P>
<P>
But Halpern said the new amendment merely "gives the government the ability to 
effectively ferret out money laundering as it has done with other types of 
narcotics activity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pivotal Factor 
</P>
<P>
In any case, attorneys suggested that the pivotal factor in money laundering 
prosecutions is the question of knowledge -- that is, did the accused launderer 
know or believe the money he was handling emanated from a dirty source? 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't prove that, you have no crime," Halpern said. "You'd better hope 
you've got them on conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
A 76-page affidavit contains quotations from transcripts of numerous wiretapped 
conversations, and prosecutors believe those quotes reveal Silberman's belief 
that the $300,000 emanated from drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, after the undercover agent referred to "the drug types" he 
worked for, Silberman allegedly said, "Let's us not even . . . use any of the 
words anymore, OK?" Later, he reportedly said, "You and I never have to use the 
word." And, responding in another conversation to the agent's description of 
his employers as "Colombian cocaine drug lords," Silberman allegedly said, "I 
don't want to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Context of Conversation 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys -- like prosecutors interviewed by The Times -- declined to 
comment on the Silberman case. But, in general, they said that to challenge 
such seemingly incriminating statements -- which prosecutors undoubtedly will 
play for jurors -- they would describe the context of the conversation and 
point out the statements that the prosecution chooses to reveal and those that 
they don't. 
</P>
<P>
"The government will pick the words that buttress their position and will often 
ignore things said immediately before," San Diego lawyer Charles Goldberg said. 
"It is important for the jury to hear the whole conversation to understand the 
tenor and get a flavor for whether it was in jest . . . and what the parties 
were really thinking." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, attorneys defending Silberman and his co-defendants likely will 
attack the FBI's extensive use of wiretaps -- which can be an Achilles heel in 
some prosecutions and often are crucial in money-laundering cases. Technical 
challenges to wiretaps can range from arguments that the wiretap order, which 
must be issued by a federal judge, was overly broad to claims that agents had 
not exhausted all other avenues of investigation before resorting to a bug. 
</P>
<P>
This case may have added vulnerability on the wiretap front. In trailing Petti 
and Silberman, the FBI used a so-called "roving wiretap" -- a new, wide-ranging 
tap authorized under a 1986 law challenged vigorously by civil libertarians. 
The law permits the electronic surveillance of a person on any telephone he 
uses -- rather than the mere bugging of a specific phone -- if the government 
proves that person has attempted to thwart interception. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen lines from homes, businesses and pay telephones were tapped 
in the Silberman investigation, and the San Diego trial will involve the first 
court test of the roving tap's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has been very specific in its limitations on the use of wiretaps 
because they did not want an indiscriminate invasion of privacy," Goldberg 
said. "The defense always closely scrutinizes the wiretaps in these cases." 
</P>
<P>
Although he conceded that the defense is likely to challenge the roving tap on 
4th Amendment invasion of privacy grounds, Asst. U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder 
Jr., who is prosecuting the Silberman case, said the orders permitting the tap 
were meticulously drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"The requirements are very specific and we've met them," he said.

FIGHTING PREJUDICE;

PROGRAM HELPS PUPILS LEARN IT'S A SMALL WORLD

<P>
Divided into randomly selected groups, each knot of eighth-graders at South 
Junior High in Anaheim was a miniature United Nations. In one group, there was 
one each from Guatemala, Mexico, Denmark Argentina and the Philippines. In 
another, students were from India and Vietnam, and three white students said 
their families had immigrated to the United States from England, Hungary and 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Each group huddled around a piece of butcher paper, and with fat felt-tip pens, 
leaders jotted down where everyone's family was from, when they arrived in the 
United States, what they considered American traits and what foods or phrases 
from other countries had become part of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
But as soon as the students in teacher Tom Peters' class finished their group 
exercise, this picture of international harmony dissolved: The Latino students 
went back to their seats with other Latinos, the whites went with other whites, 
the blacks with other blacks. Peters pointed that out to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I notice some tension sometimes, and my feeling is that . . . if we don't 
number you off, some of you would not get together in groups with other 
students who are not like you," he told them. "When you go out in the work 
world, you're going to have to work cooperatively." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot Program 
</P>
<P>
But that was a rare piece of lecturing in a classroom experiment on prejudice 
and racism that Peters has been conducting these past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
His eighth-grade social studies classes have been taking part in "A World of 
Difference," a pilot program being introduced in schools throughout six 
Southern California counties. The curriculum -- a mix of group exercises, 
computer games, class discussions and writing assignments -- aims to diminish 
racism by teaching students that it's OK to be different. 
</P>
<P>
And if there was ever a need for such a program in Southern California, Peters 
and other educators say, it is now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to teaching that the big period of immigration for this country was 
from 1900 to 1920," Peters said. "That's not true anymore. There are more 
foreign-born people right now in Southern California than in any other time of 
our history." 
</P>
<P>
The "World of Difference" program began as a massive school, media and 
community campaign in response to the racial strife that had plagued the Boston 
metropolitan area for a decade. Designed by the Anti-Defamation League and 
other social service groups, the program was lauded for defusing racial 
tensions. Eighteen cities throughout the country -- and school districts in and 
around those cities -- have copied the model. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the regional Anti-Defamation League, in conjunction with Milken 
Family Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Southern California Human 
Relations Coalition and the Los Angeles Times, introduced the program to 
educators in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and 
Ventura counties. So far, more than 1,000 teachers, counselors or other 
educators from the six counties have attended the training workshops. Peters' 
classes are among the first in Southern California to try them out as a pilot 
program. 
</P>
<P>
At South Junior High, Principal Ken Moulton already had a campaign on global 
awareness to help teachers and students cope with their changing environment 
before conflicts arise, he said. When he heard about the Anti-Defamation 
League's training, he immediately jumped at the chance to take part. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's good stuff, certainly needed in a school in transition," Moulton 
said. "This was, 10 years ago, a very white, middle-class school. What we're 
seeing here is what's happened in Anaheim -- there is a real demographic 
switch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shifting Enrollment 
</P>
<P>
In just three years, Moulton said, the student enrollment in his school has 
changed from 60% white to 58% nonwhite among his 971 students. 
</P>
<P>
"This places new demands on teachers. I think it certainly creates tension," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moulton believes schools need to play a central role in helping students and 
educators obtain "skills to deal with conflict and change. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't get a lot of these skills in their own environment, in their homes, 
and they really don't have the role models," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
And at South Junior High, as in many Southern California schools where the 
ethnic makeup of the student population is changing rapidly, the classroom is 
the crucible for lessons in race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Not to address the issue of a changing school enrollment, Moulton said, can 
lead to conflicts and other social problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim is feeling the changes that probably will come more and more to Orange 
County," he said. "The answer is not to move to Mission Viejo to get away from 
it, because you won't." 
</P>
<P>
The "World of Difference" program consists of a thick study guide with lesson 
plans that can be interwoven with a regular curriculum, and as such can be used 
year round or only occasionally, depending on the teacher, said Margery Green, 
western states education director for the Anti-Defamation League. The aim is to 
encourage students to examine racial and cultural characteristics and to talk 
about the origins of their own attitudes about race, and the consequences of 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"We now know there are several techniques (to diminish prejudice) that have 
proven successful. But preaching . . . that doesn't work," Green said. "It 
doesn't effectively diminish prejudice. . . . We all generalize, and you have 
to break down those stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
In Peters' classes, students have had group discussions. They have seen films. 
They have worked on a computer game that allowed them to play President of the 
United States as immigration policy was being set for the country. 
</P>
<P>
Educators note that racism is best combatted at an early age, before attitudes 
turn into hardened feelings of prejudice. The "World of Difference" is 
recommended for the sixth through 12th grades in other school districts. But in 
junior high school, Peters has learned, a lesson on social equality contrasts 
with another reality: At this age, students are aching to fit in with any 
group. 
</P>
<P>
His students practically bounced into his classroom, their appearances 
announcing what group they identify with. 
</P>
<P>
There were cholos, Latino boys with khaki pants and white T-shirts. Another 
boy, 13-year-old Kyle Riggs, called himself a "skater," explaining that the 
meaning of this should be obvious to others by his Ruff N' Tough T-shirt, baggy 
jeans and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
There were Latinas with their bangs swept off their foreheads with mousse and 
black eyeliner ringing their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli girl, newly arrived in Anaheim, kept to herself. 
</P>
<P>
Another boy said he was a "poseur." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a wanna-be," another boy explained. "It means he wants to be a skater 
or a surfer or something else that he really isn't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Labels 
</P>
<P>
Asked why they liked placing labels on themselves, Joey Tarantino, 13, said: 
"Nobody's the same. It's no fun to be the same. It would be really dull." 
</P>
<P>
But the students answered "no" in a loud chorus when asked if the different 
groups, racial or social, mix well with other groups in their school or 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"The skaters don't like the cholos, the skinheads don't like the blacks," 
14-year-old Phillip Covarrubias said. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
"Because they dress different. We dress different. We talk different, we move 
different," said Cathy Santamaria, 14. 
</P>
<P>
But several said being different does not have to mean being better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can be different," said Migdalia Rodriguez, 14. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Garcia, 13, called himself a cholo, but he drew a distinction between 
himself and others of his social group. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see someone, you can tell if he's a cholo," Sergio said. "He has his 
hair back, he looks mean. . . . No, I don't look like that. I'm not like a 
regular cholo, not like a mean cholo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyes Opened 
</P>
<P>
Sergio said the "World of Difference" program has opened his eyes to a 
different kind of population in his city. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned about Vietnam, how the Vietnamese who are here had to leave their 
country because of the war," he said. "I didn't know that before." 
</P>
<P>
The day after each group of students wrote down their family origins, the 
butcher papers were displayed on the bulletin board and the class talked about 
what each group had written. 
</P>
<P>
One group had listed the following as American traits: garage sales, Pic 'N' 
Save, schools, homes, work. 
</P>
<P>
"To insinuate that people come here and didn't know how to work doesn't make 
sense," Peters told them. 
</P>
<P>
One student said immigrants had to learn about different types of work or 
different work values when they came to this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're All Getting Along' 
</P>
<P>
Peters next pointed out to them the racial mix in their classes and asked, 
"What can we learn from all of this?" 
</P>
<P>
"That everybody's from different cultures, and we're all getting along," one 
student responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we typical of the city of Anaheim?" Peters asked. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Not places like Anaheim Hills," one boy interjected. "That's somewhere where 
everyone's rich and all white." 
</P>
<P>
Peters then asked, "Are we learning more by being in this type of environment 
than if we were, maybe, in a rural area with not as much mixture?" 
</P>
<P>
Mark, a white student, answered: "Of course, because I eat burritos and I'm 
sure they eat hamburgers, hot dogs, and we eat other things too." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Peters' students said lessons such as these are helping their 
generation grow up with different attitudes than those of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my grandpa is prejudiced," Joey Tarantino said. "If there is a black 
around, he says something about it and I get mad. I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racial Tension 
</P>
<P>
After class, several students said racial tension exists every day at South 
Junior High, though it doesn't often come to a head. But they guessed it was no 
different than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Peters' class is the only one where we talk about it," student Hector 
Juarez said. "The others, they just want to forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Moulton and Peters said there is little friction between the students, 
particularly considering how swiftly the school's ethnic population is 
changing. Occasionally, however, it happens. 
</P>
<P>
In Peters' third-period class one day, as students were getting settled, some 
boys were talking in the back when one youth, a white student who was leaning 
back on his chair behind a computer, slipped and fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
He jumped up and looked angrily at a Latino student who had been standing 
nearby and punched him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
The students were stunned, but then a couple of them yelled out, "Get him. . . 
! " 
</P>
<P>
Peters held on to the Latino boy to keep him from hitting the other youth. The 
first boy was sent to the principal's office, and the second boy's nose bled 
onto the floor, on Peters' hands and on some of the students as the class 
waited for another teacher to assist. 
</P>
<P>
Two girls were close to crying. 
</P>
<P>
When both finally had left the classroom, Peters deftly turned the scene into 
an object lesson on violence, race and conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an ethnic thing," Peters told them. "It was not a white kid 
hitting a Chicano kid." 
</P>
<P>
The students agreed. The issue they were more interested in was whether justice 
dictated that the second boy should have hit back. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (he) showed a lot of maturity for not hitting him back," Peters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Peters said he feared that some students might have perceived it as a 
racial conflict had he not made them discuss it. "Sure, honestly speaking. But 
it was more than race."

TEACHER GETS A LESSON ON THE MAKING OF HISTORY VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Su Scott has been making history the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido schoolteacher might not make it into the Guinness Book of World 
Records or win an Oscar, but she has three achievements to show for her 
yearlong efforts, long after the glow of accomplishment has faded. 
</P>
<P>
It was just about a year ago that the Felicita School special-education 
instructor decided to add to her tasks as teacher, wife and mother. She became 
a producer, director, author and technician. 
</P>
<P>
She applied for a modest grant from the North County Community Television 
Foundation to produce a 25-minute video on Escondido's history. It was, after 
all, the city's centennial in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memo Was a Prophetic Plea 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lerner, a foundation director, recalled Scott's ploy that caught the 
judges' attention. She attached a yellow handwritten memo to each copy of her 
application, imploring: "Please don't throw this baby out with the bath water." 
</P>
<P>
The plea was prophetic. Five days after she delivered her video production, 
"Escondido: A Living History," on March 10, she delivered a 7-pound, 2-ounce 
baby boy, Tyler Stephen Scott-Okerblom. 
</P>
<P>
The video will premiere April 26 before an Escondido City Council meeting at 
City Hall. Tyler is available for viewing almost anytime, with an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Scott doesn't blame Tyler for her tardiness in failing to produce her film by 
the city's October centennial. 
</P>
<P>
"The grant was for a six-month period, but I didn't realize what I was getting 
into. It was a new language: camcorders, story boards, wipes, fades," she 
explained. "They (the North County Community Television Foundation) kept giving 
me extensions and I kept expanding the scope of the project." 
</P>
<P>
With a $4,000 grant -- the largest that the foundation dispenses -- Scott 
produced the historical video, with polish provided by dozens of "helpers" 
recruited by Scott's enthusiasm and blarney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Traffic Stopper 
</P>
<P>
She remembers the high points of the production process, which included 
stopping traffic on busy Escondido Boulevard to film a narrative without the 
rumbling of trucks in the background. She remembers standing barefoot on a 
marble counter in the foyer of the new Escondido City Hall, balancing a 
historical picture in "just the right light" for one shot. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious teacher planned to re-enact the Battle of San Pasqual, but was 
thwarted when her insurance policy expired before she could assemble stand-ins 
for the U.S. and Mexican troops who battled to a standoff in 1846 in the valley 
south of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
But her luck held. She found a history buff who had filmed the annual December 
reenactment of the Mexican-American War battle and, with the help of her 
volunteers, turned the amateur film into a startlingly realistic sepia battle 
sequence worthy of the once-heralded television documentary, "You Were There." 
</P>
<P>
Scott recruited the city's historians for verbal accounts of Escondido history 
and persuaded technicians from the local cable TV firm and elsewhere to give 
the amateur production a professional finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot more appreciation for television now that I have seen the skill 
and sophisticated equipment it takes to do some of the things we take for 
granted," Scott said, admitting that she was very naive to think she could 
produce a professional project on a $4,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody pitched in," she said. The Escondido elementary school district put 
$100 into the kitty and paid for a substitute teacher when she was forced to be 
away from her classroom on a "shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Bank anted up some money, and the retirees at Redwood Terrace added 
to the pot. The San Diego Historical Society gave her free use of their 
historical pictures in return for her research reports. Dimension Cable 
Television added $1,000 in staff time, and a dozen other companies donated 
goods, services and cash. 
</P>
<P>
"If I added it all up, I guess it would be a $25,000 project," Scott admitted. 
"I am proud of it. And, I am glad that it's done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Projects, Too 
</P>
<P>
To add to the hectic pace of the year past, Scott and her husband bought the 
home that they had been renting and launched into a major renovation project, 
which sometimes kept them up until 1 a.m., painting and plastering and 
preparing for the hired workmen due the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't tell her film co-workers that she was pregnant, she said, "because I 
didn't want them to treat me in a different way." 
</P>
<P>
It was December before it became obvious to everyone that she was producing 
more than a historical project. 
</P>
<P>
Now Scott, who is on maternity leave, can relax in her remodeled home, cradling 
her newborn son as she sips lemonade and watches the completed video with her 
3-year-old daughter, Lorin Halley (named after the comet) Scott-Okerblom. 
</P>
<P>
She looks forward to a few months of rest, to the upcoming preview of her 
Escondido epic and to the new set of amateurs vying for foundation grants, due 
to be selected later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if a schoolteacher who knows nothing about it can do it, then anyone 
can," she said.

BUYOUT MAY HELP NASSCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chart of National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co.'s recent history in San Diego 
would have many more valleys than peaks. Strikes, major wage concessions, fatal 
accidents and lost contracts have plagued the shipyard, which has shrunk from a 
high of 7,600 employees in 1980 to about 2,500 today. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most optimistic comment one could make about the West Coast's only 
remaining major shipbuilder is that it is still alive, since foreign 
competition has defeated many other U. S. shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not surprising that reaction to the news last week of a 
management-led buyout was somewhat subdued. 
</P>
<P>
Employees, who saw their wages cut by 17% to 50% seven months ago, could hardly 
be expected to be enthusiastic about another management plan, even though it 
will eventually give employees at least 45% of the shipyard's stock. 
</P>
<P>
But the buyout does give Nassco a reprieve from its expected death sentence. 
And it could help prevent the loss of another major firm in San Diego, which 
has lost several in recent years because of mergers or moves. Nassco may not be 
the major employer it used to be, but it is still one of the largest in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Whether ownership by employees and managers will be enough to give Nassco a 
competitive edge, however, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Both labor and management say that will depend, in part, on whether a real 
"sense of ownership" develops among employees. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, that will mean getting past the bitterness of last summer's 
strike and the drastic wage cuts, which will take time. 
</P>
<P>
Several recently initiated programs to give employees a greater say in the 
company's operation are steps in the right direction. More of that is possible 
if employees come to see themselves as owners who stand to gain financially 
from more efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
One of Nassco's chief competitors for Navy contracts, the Avondale shipyard in 
Louisiana, has seemed to thrive under employee ownership. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that Nassco will, too.

SCHOOL IS NOW VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Jolla Country Day School has now become the victim in this whole incident 
with the Rogers family. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Lowery and others are giving a very biased picture of the Rogers' 
situation. They expound on the theory that La Jolla Country Day is knuckling 
under to terrorism by wanting to ensure safety for their faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
And where are the Rogerses during all this publicity? Secreted away in a safe 
place with 24-hour armed guards that accompany them everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Is going into hiding not knuckling under to terrorism? If it is so safe for 
Mrs. Rogers to go back to school as a teacher, why don't the Rogerses go back 
to their home and show that they don't want to knuckle under to terrorism? Why 
should not La Jolla Country Day be extremely cautious about the safety of the 
children they are entrusted with, when the Rogerses are being even more 
cautious about their own personal safety? 
</P>
<P>
We can be fair in saying that La Jolla Country Day has been placed in the 
middle of an extremely difficult and unique situation. Try as they may, they 
cannot make everyone happy.

REFLECTIONS: 'I JUST ENJOY CREATING. I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S WRONG WITH A 
LOT OF PEOPLE, THEY'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO BE CREATIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jacqueline Ball's living room is filled with dolls, each with a face as 
individual as the faces in a crowd. Some are mothers, others are daughters and 
quite a few of the dolls are modeled after their creators. Ball, 56, teaches 
doll-making and loves to help others tap the creativity that she only recently 
discovered in herself. Ball was interviewed in her Chula Vista home by Times 
staff writer Leslie Wolf and photographed by Barbara Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, I had nothing really of value in my life but raising my four kids. 
I loved to design clothes, and I would sit up at night and make my children the 
most gorgeous clothes. 
</P>
<P>
I started making doll clothes for someone and finally decided I wanted to learn 
how to make the dolls, too. I started teaching myself sculpting about seven 
years ago. I've never had any training in it, but I learned by my mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
I start with the head, and each head is a separate sculpture. It begins as an 
egg-shaped lump of clay -- just clay that comes from millions of years of water 
rushing over the earth. Then, I mark it out like you would a painting. For 
instance, the space between the eyes is one "eye," and there's one "eye" 
between each eye and the ear, so you have a total width of five "eyes" across 
the head. For a baby's face you drop it a little lower, and put all the 
features in a smaller space. I can do a head now in two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
I go to people's houses to teach them how to make dolls in the likeness of 
themselves or people they know, and I have a few people come here. First-timers 
almost always wind up doing dolls that look like themselves, because they're 
feeling their own faces for an understanding of the bone structure. I usually 
keep my classes small, less than six people, because you get a big group and 
you can't give them enough attention. It's exciting to see somebody develop 
their creativity. 
</P>
<P>
I give demonstrations at grade schools, too. I take 50 pounds of clay and let 
them each dig in, and I show them how to sculpt a leg. Some of the littler 
ones, I let them make a snail, which is easier because all they have to do is 
make a worm and roll it up. 
</P>
<P>
I also started writing poetry a few years ago. I thought I'd never written a 
poem before, but I went back to my high school yearbook and saw a poem of mine 
published there. I don't know what happened in all the years in between -- I 
think I got so bogged down in having a family and doing things that I forgot to 
be creative. It took getting out of my marriage to start my creativity again. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I've had a couple of hundred poems published, and I have a women's poetry 
workshop over here. I'm the editor of a literary magazine too, called 
Crazyquilt, which is the title of a poem I wrote. The magazine has been going 
for about three years now, and I've been with it since the very beginning. 
</P>
<P>
My interest in poems started when I went back to school in 1980 and took a 
class in English, and the teacher started teaching poetry. I wasn't even sure 
what a poem was. I went home and wrote a complex poem within a poem and I 
didn't even know it was supposed to be hard. It was wonderful to be creative 
again. I also took physics, figuring I was going to be Madame Curie. Then, I 
saw I had to get out of my marriage, so I started taking business classes so I 
would at least have some skills to work with. 
</P>
<P>
After my divorce, I was truly a displaced homemaker. I went to get a job so I 
could stay in school, but I couldn't even find a job for $3.50 an hour. So I 
decided I'd start a business and give myself a job. One of my daughters loaned 
me the money to open a shop in Spring Valley, "Dolls by Jacqueline." 
</P>
<P>
I had my shop six years, and I loved it. Then I got sick . . . and I had to 
close down. Now, I'm back on my feet and looking for a shop again. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to open up a shop here in Chula Vista, and there's a lovely area I 
have my eye on near a lot of craft and gift stores. I want to also get back 
into designing little girls' dresses because I feel that's my very top field. 
It's so much fun to make a little girl's outfit. They're so delicate. 
</P>
<P>
I just enjoy creating. I think that's part of what's wrong with a lot of 
people, they've forgotten how to be creative.

TRUSTING BOSS MAY HAVE BEEN VICTIM OF FORMER EMPLOYEE

<P>
In the old days, a handshake did it. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the lawyers and the contracts and all that. When Bernard O'Neal looked 
you in the eye and shook your hand, you had a deal. 
</P>
<P>
That's what employees and customers said they liked about O'Neal and his San 
Pedro insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
Honesty, loyalty and trust helped O'Neal, now 86, build a thriving business, 
but authorities say those old-fashioned values left him vulnerable.

In Long Beach Superior Court last week, O'Neal's former office manager and her 
husband faced one charge each of grand theft for allegedly embezzling $34,000 
from Harbor Insurance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say that O'Neal left much of the operation of his agency to office 
manager Georgia Mulchahey, 58, and that she used her position to divert money 
from the business to her own use. At least $9,000 was used to buy equipment and 
office supplies to help her 64-year-old husband, James Mulchahey, start a 
competing insurance firm in San Pedro, according to charges filed by the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchaheys, who pleaded innocent, would face up to four years in prison if 
convicted. The couple, ordered earlier this month to stand trial by a San Pedro 
Municipal Court judge, has declined to comment, and their lawyer did not return 
several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Another $150,000 of O'Neal's money is missing, but there is no evidence of 
where it went, said Los Angeles Police Detective Steve Wynn. Documents also 
indicate that Georgia Mulchahey may have sent dozens of customers away from 
O'Neal to her husband's firm, Marina General Insurance Agency, Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Insurance is investigating the allegations, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Mr. O'Neal was too trusting," said Barbara Niro, the octogenarian's 
assistant. "He does business on people's word. . . . Maybe you can't do it that 
way anymore. It's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Following the alleged losses last year, O'Neal sold his 55-year-old business 
and went into semi-retirement. His name is still on the outside of the Gaffey 
Street agency and the new owner has kept him on as a consultant. Two 
business-phone lines ring directly to his home across the street, so O'Neal can 
take calls from customers -- who he calls "Sir" and "Ma'am" -- on nights and 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal brought that homespun approach with him from Texarkana, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He was a lanky farm boy of 20 when he and two buddies drove to Southern 
California in 1922 in search of adventure "and a job, anything to make a 
dollar," O'Neal recalled recently in an interview at his house. "We didn't know 
we were going to stay." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal drove a mule team at a construction site in El Segundo, before landing a 
job as a longshoreman in San Pedro. But after seven years, 90 cents an hour 
just wasn't enough money. 
</P>
<P>
And O'Neal wanted to wear a suit and tie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Trust Him 
</P>
<P>
He got his wish when he took a job as a salesman with Pacific Mutual Life 
Insurance Co. O'Neal said he isn't sure what made people trust him -- maybe it 
was his farm upbringing or his own years as a working man. 
</P>
<P>
His first boss could see it. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'People will believe you,' " O'Neal recalled. " 'They'll believe what 
you say. You'll do well.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, O'Neal opened his own firm, Harbor Insurance Agency on Gaffey Street. 
He has been selling insurance there ever since, building a base of customers 
who are not shy about praising him. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Heilig, 93, said he has stayed with O'Neal for more than 40 years because 
the insurance man takes a personal interest in his problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customer Support 
</P>
<P>
When a roadster crashed into his home in the 1950s, Heilig recalled, O'Neal was 
there before Heilig was. Heilig, sounding like a television testimonial, said 
that a contractor arrived soon after and O'Neal promptly wrote a check to pay 
for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard of anything like that before," Heilig said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Good, owner of a Wilmington car dealership, has similar praise. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years there were "a lot of times when we were short on cash," Good 
said. "He would advance us the money to take care of things. He would always 
look out for our interests." 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, O'Neal sometimes would loan his second car to clients whose 
cars were in the shop, Niro said. "He takes it very, very personally when 
something happens to his clients," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, O'Neal said he gradually turned over more responsibility 
to his employees. He hired Georgia Mulchahey about four years ago as a 
bookkeeper and promoted her two years later to office manager. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no idea that Mulchahey's husband was opening Marina General 
Insurance Agency on Western Avenue, just two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Problems 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said he authorized Georgia Mulchahey to write checks, but became 
disturbed in 1987 when she began asking him to withdraw money from his personal 
bank account to cover the agency's operating expenses. It was something he had 
never done before, O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
He hired an accountant to audit his business and was told that money was 
missing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony at the Mulchaheys' preliminary hearing: 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Mulchahey wrote checks from Harbor Insurance totaling $9,000 to buy 
office supplies, a computer system and a street sign for her husband's 
business. She wrote another check for $10,000 to her husband's company and 
deposited O'Neal's personal draft for $15,000 into her own account. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said it was only after he spoke with authorities that he learned the 
Mulchaheys had their insurance licenses taken away several years earlier for 
diverting premiums for their personal use. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barry Nelson, a senior investigator with the state Department of 
Insurance, James Mulchahey had his license revoked and Georgia Mulchahey had 
her license suspended for 90 days in 1978 after an administrative law judge 
ruled that the two had improperly diverted $8,000 in premiums. 
</P>
<P>
The violations occurred at the All Service Insurance Corp. in Torrance, Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, the state agency ruled that James Mulchahey had been 
"rehabilitated" and reissued him a license to sell insurance. Five months 
later, he opened Marina General Insurance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said the thought that someone may have gained an unfair advantage 
bothers him as much as the money he lost. He said he is determined to see the 
criminal case through to its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be just, to let (the Mulchaheys) keep going on like that against 
all the other fair insurance agencies out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the trauma of the case, O'Neal said he doesn't plan to change his ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I have trusted people, over many, many years," he said. "In spite of this, I 
still will trust people."

HONOR STUDENTS KILLED IN CRASH MINUTES AFTER TAKING AN EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers at Junipero Serra High School expressed shock Friday at the deaths of 
two honor students who were killed in a car crash minutes after finishing a 
history mid-term exam at the Gardena school. 
</P>
<P>
The students, both 16-year-old sophomores, died Thursday when their car, 
traveling up to 80 m.p.h., bounced off a curb and was sheared in half by a 
light post, police said. Two other students were injured, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
One of the students, Sean Andrews, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 
accident at Van Ness Avenue and 77th Street, about five miles from the Serra 
campus, police said. A second victim, DeMar Harper, 16, was taken to Daniel 
Freeman Memorial Hospital, where he died soon after arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Two other 16-year-old Serra students in the car were injured. Michael Foley was 
in critical but stable condition Saturday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. A fourth student, Corey Jones, 
sustained minor injuries and was treated at Daniel Freeman hospital and 
released, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Urban Naal, a world history teacher at Serra, said the four sophomores 
had just finished an hourlong mid-term exam in his class before leaving the 
campus at 11 a.m.. It was an abbreviated school day and the last day of the 
mid-term exam period. 
</P>
<P>
"They had just left my class and 15 minutes later they had the accident," Naal 
said. "These were neat kids, very good students. These were kids who you knew 
were going to be future leaders at the school." 
</P>
<P>
Another Serra teacher, who asked not to be named, said the tragedy was 
"particularly difficult for our students. Our students are very close. We 
always say we're the Serra family. There's a real closeness here, and the boys 
are taking this very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
A private, all-boys Catholic school run by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, 
Serra has about 350 students. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial Mass will be said at the school Monday, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dennis Burkman, a Los Angeles Police Department traffic investigator, 
said Andrews was driving the compact car when the accident occurred. No other 
vehicles appeared to be involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burkman said Corey Jones, one of the surviving students, told investigators 
that Andrews was trying to keep up with a speeding car in front of them. After 
the car turned off at an intersection, the students continued north on Van Ness 
at speeds up to 80 m.p.h. when Andrews lost control of the car, Burkman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The car slammed into a metal light post and it virtually sheared the car in 
half, just as if you'd cut it in half with a saw," Burkman said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they were notified of the accident soon after it happened 
by a phone call from another student, and priests from the school were on the 
scene within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Naal, who visited the victims' families Friday with Father Roland Bunda, the 
campus minister, said funeral arrangements were pending. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all good students, good academically and they didn't cause any 
problems," Naal said. "It's going to be hard to go back to class on Monday."

BESIEGED LIBRARIES POISED TO BRANCH OUT WITH SEED FROM BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At its opening in 1952, the Sunland-Tujunga branch of the Los Angeles Public 
Library was the jewel in the community's crown. But the area's population has 
nearly doubled since then, and today the library is stretched to the breaking 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Shelves are filled to capacity so books are stored on tables and carts. When 
librarians order new volumes, they must get rid of others. Children have been 
turned away from special summer reading events for lack of room. And, after 
school, students must jostle for space at one of the library's five worktables. 
</P>
<P>
"We must constantly make decisions about should we keep things or pull them, 
and sometimes we make wrong decisions," librarian Mary Wynton said. 
</P>
<P>
But an end to this problem is in sight. Using $21.2 million from the 
$53.4-million bond issue passed by voters last week, library officials plan to 
construct three libraries in the San Fernando Valley while expanding three of 
the Valley's 17 branches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tremendous," said Joyce Elliott, regional manager of the library's East 
Valley district. "We really need more space. All the buildings were built in 
the '50s and '60s, and they were built for a different population." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanding Shelf Space 
</P>
<P>
Nina Wilson, regional manager of the West Valley library district, said the 
money will be used to expand each library's space for books and divert patrons 
from overused branches, such as Woodland Hills, Canoga Park and Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lacked the book space we need to have here," said Marlene Wulff, a 
librarian at the Van Nuys branch. "When we buy books, we have to get rid of 
things we would keep." 
</P>
<P>
The quality of services has suffered too, Wulff said. "We have so many 
questions that are so technical and beyond our smaller collection's scope -- it 
has become very noticeable." 
</P>
<P>
Presentations that involve speakers such as children's story hours, puppet 
shows, authors' talks or community forums pose special problems in one-room 
branch libraries such as those in Sunland or Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a nice program, you are inconveniencing people," said Anne 
Landon, children's librarian at the Panorama City branch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prior Measure Defeated 
</P>
<P>
Valley voters were blamed for the narrow defeat in November of Proposition L, 
which would have authorized $90 million in bonds for libraries, including the 
expansion and restoration of the city's historic and fire-damaged Central 
Library. About 70% of the voters citywide approved the bond measure, but in the 
northwestern, western and central portions of the Valley, Proposition L 
captured barely 50% of the vote. It had needed approval by two-thirds of the 
voters to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott attributed the success of last week's bond measure, Proposition 1, to 
its exclusion of the Central Library and to the volunteer efforts of librarians 
who walked precincts to drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
Officials still are drawing up a construction schedule, but projects planned 
for the Valley include building an $8-million regional library in Sepulveda, a 
$2.7-million branch library in Woodland Hills and a $2.1-million branch in 
Granada Hills, a $3.2-million expansion of Panorama City's branch and a 
$2.9-million expansion in Van Nuys. And the Sunland-Tujunga building will be 
replaced with a $2.3-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
Regional libraries are bigger than branches, offering larger collections of 
material, including reference books and magazines, and generally longer hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to mean service especially in areas where there has been no 
service before, and that will mean relief from heavily overused facilities," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wynton hopes that Sunland-Tujunga's new building will include a community room 
so that the library can hold speakers programs without disturbing those who 
wish to read. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Room for Patrons 
</P>
<P>
Librarians at many Valley branches also said more space will allow them to 
expand their book collections and give more room to patrons using the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite thrilled," Landon said. It was National Library Week last week 
"and so the timing for this is really great." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley is deemed too wealthy to qualify for federal funds, so without 
Proposition 1, the area might not have had any new libraries until the next 
century, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been sitting here with the property for all three of these branches 
for 20 years and have been trying to get more funds to build them," Wilson 
said. "This was terribly important for the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
But library patrons said the system still has other problems to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"This library is only open a few hours a day, and I can never get in here when 
I need to," said John Alm, 30, studying at the Sunland-Tujunga branch last 
week. The branch is open 1 to 8 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 1 to 5:30 p.m. 
Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.

IS CHURCH OLD-TIME RELIGION OR PROSTITUTION?; 
</P>
<P>
ARRESTED CANYON COUNTRY COUPLE CLAIM BELIEFS INVOLVE SEX FOR SACRIFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They say they are practicing the world's oldest religion. But police say their 
enterprise resembles the world's oldest profession. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the debate surrounding Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, a Canyon Country 
couple who have hit the national talk-show circuit to promote the unorthodox 
theology of the Church of the Most High Goddess, a "sex church" the Tracys 
operate in West Los Angeles. They appeared Feb. 16 on the "Sally Jessy Raphael 
Show" and taped a "Geraldo" show this month that has yet to air. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy says she and other women act as priestesses who absolve the 
sins of male followers through sexual religious rites that predate 
Christianity. So far, she says, she has brought more than 2,000 male converts 
into the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything God wants from me, I will give him," said Tracy, 46. "If he wants me 
to be monogamous, I'll be monogamous. If he says go have sex with 20,000 men, 
I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Los Angeles Police Department vice officers arrested the Tracys -- 
Mary Ellen on suspicion of prostitution and Will on suspicion of pimping -- 
citing the couple's request for donations to the church. "If you accept money 
for a sex act, it's prostitution," Detective Alan Vanderpool said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Religious Sacrifices 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy, 51, acknowledged that church followers must contribute money or 
services to participate in rituals that involve sexual intercourse. But he said 
the contributions are religious sacrifices protected by the First Amendment. He 
said he will ask that the case against him and his wife be thrown out on 
religious grounds. Their arraignment is scheduled May 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys live in Canyon Country but operate their church out of a 
four-bedroom, Spanish-style house they rent just outside Beverly Hills in West 
Los Angeles. The sparsely furnished house has no pews or pulpit. The few wall 
hangings include posters of movie stars and a framed nude photograph of Mary 
Ellen Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
During services, priestesses teach the male followers about church doctrine, 
she said. The men confess their sins and have their transgressions forgiven 
during sexual intercourse, she said. Will Tracy said he is the religion's high 
priest, which he referred to as an administrative post. 
</P>
<P>
The church incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Nevada on Dec. 14, 1988, 
but has not applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status. Will 
Tracy declined to discuss its finances. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderpool, a 13-year vice squad veteran, called the church a creative scam, 
similar to fraudulent escort services and massage parlors, to circumvent 
prostitution laws. But even Vanderpool agreed, along with constitutional 
scholars, that the Tracys' church poses an intriguing legal question: Does the 
First Amendment protect an avowed religious practice that appears to be 
prostitution? 
</P>
<P>
In rare instances, state and federal courts have ruled that some illegal acts 
can have religious purposes, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor and 
constitutional expert. California and Arizona courts have said that some 
American Indians may use the hallucinogen peyote, normally an illegal narcotic, 
to practice their ancient religions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Amish residents of Wisconsin to pull 
their children from school after the eighth grade, in defiance of compulsory 
education laws, to shield the youngsters from secular teachings in high school, 
said Thomas Grey, a Stanford University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
But claims of religious intent do not guarantee protection from the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bigamy Illegal 
</P>
<P>
Bigamy, although once sanctioned by Mormons, is illegal. Courts repeatedly have 
struck down religious objections to vaccinations because there is a compelling 
public interest to control disease, Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
But how would courts rule on the Church of the Most High Goddess, where Mary 
Ellen Tracy and the other priestesses wear strapless red-sequined dresses, 
fishnet hose and black spiked heels? 
</P>
<P>
Neither professor was familiar with the Tracys' endeavor. But, speaking before 
the couple's arrest last week, the experts said Mary Ellen Tracy's provocative 
dress would definitely hurt the church's chances in court because fishnet 
stockings and sequins do not denote piety. 
</P>
<P>
Judges find pious intent important when ruling on religious practices that may 
violate the law, the professors said. While courts will not declare a religion 
valid or invalid, they will decide whether a group sincerely believes the 
doctrine it professes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1962, a federal court in Washington rejected claims by the 
Boo-hoos, a hastily created religious sect, that smoking marijuana was a 
sacrament, Chemerinsky said. The claim was not sincere, the court decided, 
noting that the Boo-hoos' emblem was a three-headed toad. 
</P>
<P>
Another skeptic is Burt DuBrow, producer of the "Sally Jessy Raphael Show." 
DuBrow said he now regrets letting the Tracys appear on the nationally 
syndicated talk show. "I question the validity of the church," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Column 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys insist they are devout, despite Mary Ellen Tracy's weekly column in 
a sexually explicit newspaper, the Hollywood Press, and an erotic video, "When 
Love Came to Town," that she made in November for $500. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy said he received a revelation five years ago to found a church that 
would re-establish the Cult of Isis, a goddess revered in ancient Egypt. The 
church was formally established in May, 1987, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Crossley, a professor of religion at USC, said he knew nothing about 
the Tracys' church but confirmed that some ancient religions, such as the Cult 
of Isis, did include sex acts in their rituals. The religion is thought to have 
died out by 476 with the fall of the Roman Empire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys would not discuss their personal lives in detail. They would not 
talk about their seven children -- ages 4 to 18 -- except to say they are not 
involved in the church. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy holds a master's degree in environmental science and chemistry 
from Portland State University and wrote her thesis on an enzyme found in 
pears. "She's very bright -- no two ways about that," said her former faculty 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy once ran a chain of karate studios in Oregon and briefly worked as a 
building inspector for the city of Santa Monica before he was fired four years 
ago. Santa Monica officials refused to comment on Tracy, who says he makes his 
living as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested the couple Tuesday night after Vanderpool posed as 
a man responding to a sexually suggestive ad the Tracys placed in the L.A. 
Express. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderpool said Mary Ellen Tracy requested a $150 donation for the church and 
told him to perform oral sex on her to show his allegiance to the church. When 
he refused, Vanderpool said, she ordered him to leave. Other officers arrested 
the couple as Vanderpool was shown out the front door, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy faces one misdemeanor count of prostitution. Will Tracy is 
accused of one count of pimping, a felony. Both are free on $2,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman found at the house, identified only as Jane Doe, was arrested on 
suspicion of living in a house of ill fame, a misdemeanor, Vanderpool said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy confirmed most of Vanderpool's account but said his wife merely 
asked if the detective was willing to support the church in some way. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys have had other run-ins with the law, but Tracy said they were based 
on misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
Before the church was formally organized, Mary Ellen Tracy was charged with 
prostitution and her husband with running a house of ill fame in Santa Monica 
in February, 1986. The charges were dismissed 11 months later after detectives 
refused to identify an informant who allegedly paid her $100 to have sex, 
according to court records. Will Tracy said the informant never existed and 
denied the prostitution allegation. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's legal problems also have involved the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children's Services, which removed six of the Tracys' children 
from their Canyon Country home for one week in November. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the Tracys were maintaining unsanitary living conditions. 
But a Newhall municipal judge dismissed the child-endangerment charges last 
month, saying sheriff's deputies illegally entered the house without a warrant. 
The Tracys said they provide the children with a good home.

TRASH MAN HAULS AWAY STREET'S LOVE

In an age when few people know their neighborhood grocer, service station 
manager or mailman by name, Arthur Green is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a longtime garbage man in North Hollywood, won affection and respect 
from his customers through three decades of hauling away oversized loads, 
fetching trash cans from the back yards of elderly residents and nursing 
wounded birds found by neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't just the trash man," said Betty Harris, 40, who has lived in North 
Hollywood her whole life. "When we were kids, we'd all run over to say hello 
and he'd stop and play ball with us." 
</P>
<P>
"It got so we'd look forward to Friday when he picked up the garbage," said 
Sheila Reutter, a North Hollywood resident for 25 years. "We miss him already." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 20 residents of the Bakman Avenue area of North Hollywood 
threw a surprise party for Green, who retired earlier this month. Green, a 
portly 60-year-old man with white hair and a gold-capped front tooth, had tears 
in his eyes as he opened a gift-wrapped home video camera residents gave him. 
</P>
<P>
"All my neighborhoods were friendly, but this street was special, real 
special," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Five days a week, Green got up at 5 a.m. to collect trash for the Los Angeles 
Department of Sanitation, he said. Once a week, his job took him to Bakman 
Avenue, a quiet neighborhood of modest houses and well-tended yards just south 
of the Ventura Freeway and east of Tujunga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Harris remembers the time almost 30 years ago she and other neighborhood 
children brought Green a baby bird that had fallen from its nest. Green put the 
bird in a box and told the children to pray for the return of its health, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he drove away and every time we saw him he said that baby bird was doing 
fine, and we believed him," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Terzian, 59, a retired bank manager, said Green used to pick up garbage 
cans from her mother's back yard because the elderly woman was too feeble to 
bring them out to the street. Such favors were "a kindness that never stopped," 
Terzian said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tampered With Clock 
</P>
<P>
Green was so devoted to his job that his children once tampered with his alarm 
clock to get him to stay home and nurse a cold, said Odile Green-Street, 22, 
one of his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
But when his 27-year-old daughter Deborah Evans died earlier this year during 
surgery, Green decided it was time to turn in his khaki uniform and spend some 
time with his family, said Christine Green, his wife. The couple plan to drive 
to New Orleans this summer to stay with relatives, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hauling trash seems to be second nature for Green, though. Green-Street, who 
lives in Fort Ord, said her father woke up early during a recent visit to help 
the garbage man there.

2 HELD IN SHOOTING DEATH OF FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman who went with a friend to collect a debt in Studio City were 
in custody Saturday on suspicion of murder after their friend was fatally shot, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
David Betancur, 26, of Sepulveda and Kelly Ann Poglitsch, 19, of Sylmar were 
being held without bail, although police said neither fired the shot that 
killed their 43-year-old companion. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the dead man, whose name was withheld, apparently was shot in 
self-defense on Friday by William Taylor, 41, after the victim used the butt of 
a semiautomatic assault rifle to smash his way into Taylor's home in the 4500 
block of Simpson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Betancur and Poglitsch were arrested at the scene about 6 p.m. Friday, and were 
being held without bail on suspicion of murder pending arraignment early this 
week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John McCrillis said when a death occurs during the commission of a crime, 
those involved in the crime can be charged with murder even if they "didn't 
necessarily do the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Betancur, Poglitsch and the victim had gone to Taylor's house late Friday 
afternoon, apparently because of a dispute over a vehicle and money the victim 
claimed Taylor owed him. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Sheri Herman, 42, were watching 
television when Herman heard a vehicle pull up in front of the house. Looking 
out the window, she saw an acquaintance running through the yard to the back of 
the house clutching an assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor retreated to a rear bedroom and returned with a 12-gauge shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim broke the glass in French doors at the rear of the 
house. Police said Taylor, believing he and Herman were about to be killed, 
fired a single round into the attacker's upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor and Herman ran to a neighbor's house to wait for police. 
Betancur and Poglitsch were arrested without incident a short time later.

TEACHER PAID $5,000 IN LIBEL CASE SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former science teacher at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, who was accused 
but never tried on charges that he had sex with a 16-year-old student, has 
accepted $5,000 to settle a libel suit against the Centinela Valley Union High 
School District and former school board member Robert Kruse. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Conn accepted the settlement last week shortly after the start of the 
libel trial against Kruse and the school district in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Conn claimed he was libeled in 1983 when Kruse released a copy of a 
confidential school district memo to the Daily Breeze, which published a story 
about his alleged sexual liaison with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
Conn sued the school district and Kruse, but not the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse, the husband of Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse, resigned from the school 
board in the uproar that followed publication of the story. He later was 
elected to be a trustee in the Lawndale School District. 
</P>
<P>
Conn still works for the Centinela Valley district as a biology teacher at 
Hawthorne High School.

<CORRECTION>
<P>
A story in the April 16 edition of The Times described the settlement of a 
lawsuit filed in 1983 by a Leuzinger High School teacher against the Centinela 
Valley Union High School District and school board member Robert Kruse. 
</P>
<P>
The story said the teacher, Charles Conn, had filed a lawsuit claiming he was 
libeled when Kruse released a copy of a school district memo about the 
teacher's alleged sexual liaison with a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit settlement did not resolve the question of whether the memorandum 
was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse has said throughout the six-year dispute that the memo was a public 
document because it was part of agenda materials for a public school board 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The school district and Conn have contended that the memo was confidential.

SOUTH BAY CITIES JOIN IN PROPERTY TAX SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo landowners will pay $49 million in property taxes in 1988-89, but 
the city will collect only $2.2 million of it. 
</P>
<P>
The town is not alone in its plight. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 cities statewide that levied low or no property taxes at the time 
Proposition 13 was passed in 1978 now find themselves receiving a small share 
or no share of the property tax pie under state legislation enacted to 
implement the measure. In the South Bay, both El Segundo and Carson are 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is we are being punished because prior to 13, we were a well-run 
city," El Segundo City Manager Fred Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City, which has never levied a property tax, receives nothing. "We were 
excluded forever" from receiving benefits, City Manager Karl Koski said. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, Carson, Compton, Rancho Cucamonga and Temple City have joined in 
taking the issue to court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Issue 
</P>
<P>
Charging that their residents are being taxed without receiving due benefits, 
the cities filed a suit with the state Supreme Court challenging the 
constitutionality of the present system of tax revenue distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court declined without comment to hear the case, but John Sturgeon, 
the attorney for the petitioners, filed the suit April 7 in San Bernardino 
Superior Court. The suit was filed there because Rancho Cucamonga is the 
biggest loser among the five cities under the present system. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was originally filed with the state's highest court because it 
involves a constitutional issue and the decision could shift millions of 
dollars among city coffers statewide, Sturgeon said. He had urged the court to 
act quickly because cities have to begin planning their 1989-90 budgets soon. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City Councilman Ken Gillanders, who initiated the research leading to 
the suit, was not perturbed by the Supreme Court's action. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll just take a little longer to resolve, but the constitutional issues are 
the same," he said. "It will ultimately find its way to the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
The cities want the court to invalidate legislation that was adopted to 
implement the landmark tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the legislation unfairly penalizes cities that levied low 
property taxes, or none at all, before Proposition 13. If successful, it would 
benefit 270 California cities, according to Sam Olivito, executive director of 
the California Contract Cities Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, which supports the action, represents 65 California cities, 
46 of them in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
However, not every city would gain. 
</P>
<P>
For example, six cities in the San Gabriel Valley, including Pomona and 
Pasadena, would stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. In 
the South Bay, Hermosa Beach would lose more than $230,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have a negative impact and we're not a rich city," City Manager Kevin 
Northcraft said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 limits property taxes to 1% of the full cash value of the 
property. The full cash value of real property existing when Proposition 13 was 
enacted was rolled back to that shown the county assessor's 1975-76 tax bill. 
Property developed or purchased since the passage of Proposition 13 is taxed at 
1% of the appraised value at the time of construction or purchase. Tax 
increases are limited to 2% annually. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature's scheme allocates property taxes without regard to who paid 
them," attorney Sturgeon stated in the suit. He said the "completely arbitrary" 
formula punishes cities that had shown fiscal restraint before Proposition 13 
by imposing low taxes, while rewarding those with high taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks the court to order Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to 
correct these inequities. The counties were named as respondents in the suit 
because they collect property taxes and distribute them among cities and other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The suit suggests that a fairer distribution system would rely on the total 
value of properties in a city to determine what proportion of the tax-revenue 
pie it should receive. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City would have gained about $1.46 million in revenues in fiscal 1986-87 
under the proposed system. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner among the petitioners would be El Segundo, which would have 
received $7 million more that year. The city had a property tax of 0.15% in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which had a 2.56% property tax, would be hurt more than any other city 
in the San Gabriel Valley, Olivito said. Under the proposed formula, it would 
have received about $1 million less than it did in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Marino, Sierra Madre and La Verne also would get 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing disappointment that other cities are seeking a solution that would 
penalize his city, Pomona City Manager A. J. Wilson said the larger picture of 
who needs the money most should be examined. Each city's per capita spending 
also needs to be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to give away the resources of our community," Wilson promised, 
adding that Pomona is exploring grounds for a countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena City Manager Donald McIntyre acknowledged that the petitioning cities 
have a legitimate concern but said it was their choice not to levy higher taxes 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena City Manager John Bernardi agreed: "I certainly feel for them, 
but I don't know why South Pasadena should suffer for (their) not imposing a 
property tax. We can't afford to lose any more than we've already lost." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the current revenue allocation system violates a 
provision in the state Constitution requiring that taxpayers directly benefit 
from the taxes they are paying. 
</P>
<P>
Cities with high pre-Proposition 13 tax rates receive more than their fair 
share of revenues, violating another constitutional provision mandating uniform 
taxation, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which had the county's highest property tax, 2.76%, in 1978, is 
cited as profiting the most from the current system. The city received at least 
$117 million more in property tax revenues than its residents paid in the 
1986-87 fiscal year, said Rodney Smith, economic consultant for the 
petitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would bear 95% of the losses under the proposal, Smith said. 
Besides the six San Gabriel Valley cities, Long Beach and Hermosa Beach would 
be the only others in the county to suffer if the court agrees that changes 
should be made. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stressed that county tax revenues are in a separate pool from the cities' 
revenue and would not be affected by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Olivito said the petitioning cities have long felt that "something just wasn't 
right" and have repeatedly approached the state Legislature about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to find a solution for the last 10 years, and we haven't 
received a dollar," he said. "The issue just kept snowballing." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of tax revenues has limited the services the petitioning cities have 
been able to provide their residents, the suit alleges. For example: 
</P>
<P>
Inadequate flood control facilities were a main reason that Rancho Cucamonga 
was incorporated, yet the city has been unable to afford community-level flood 
control projects. 
</P>
<P>
Compton has been forced to put off several youth programs and cannot fund 
Neighborhood Watch projects. 
</P>
<P>
Carson cannot afford to rehabilitate four toxic chemical sites and 20 abandoned 
landfills. The city, which incorporated in 1968, has no city property tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is primarily a fairness issue," Carson City Administrator Jack R. 
Smith said. "Cities that did not have property taxes prior to 13 have been 
unfairly put upon." 
</P>
<P>
Temple City has postponed implementing a school drug-awareness program and 
cannot afford a senior center. Law enforcement levels have not been increased 
to keep up with growth since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spending Our Money' 
</P>
<P>
"We're struggling to keep our heads above water, and other cities are spending 
our property tax money," said Temple City's Gillanders. As a property owner, 
Gillanders is also a petitioner in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor in 1984, Gillanders began consulting with Smith, also director of the 
Lowe Institute of Political Economy at Claremont McKenna College, about the 
validity of the allocation policy. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, the City Council commissioned Smith to research the issue. 
"In 1986 I discovered the constitutional flaws," said Smith, who now serves as 
an independent consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The other cities decided to join in the suit within the past year, Koski said. 
</P>
<P>

ALLOCATIONS OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed by five Southern California cities attacks the way that property 
tax revenue is allocated to cities. Their suit challenges the constitutionality 
of the distribution system that was enacted to implement Proposition 13. If 
successful, the suit could shift millions of dollars among city coffers 
statewide. The following is a breakdown of the tax revenue received by cities 
in the South Bay under the existing system and the distribution under the 
proposed reforms.

LIONS' MIAH BRADBURY HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO AT BAT THAN BUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You wouldn't ask the Mighty Casey to bunt. And you don't ask Miah Bradbury to 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, Loyola Marymount's deluxe junior catcher, is a legitimate line-drive 
hitter. Rockets jump regularly off Bradbury's bat into the alleys. And at 
6-foot-4, 210 pounds, the big backstopper has the bulk to send his share of 
baseballs screaming over the fences. 
</P>
<P>
But still, on one lazy February afternoon last season, during a game between 
Loyola and Cal State Los Angeles, a devilish notion somehow crept into 
Bradbury's head. A notion to bunt for a base hit. That's right, bunt. 
</P>
<P>
The line drives hadn't been falling in lately for Bradbury, and he was in a bit 
of a slump. And Bradbury figured that dumping a baseball down in the thick 
grass along the third base line might be the right antidote for his sagging 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"The third baseman was playing me way out in left field," Bradbury said. "It 
seemed like a good idea at the time." 
</P>
<P>
So Bradbury squared around. And the pitcher, Bill Bene -- the first-round pick 
of the Dodgers in last year's free agent draft -- uncorked a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury got the bunt down. But unfortunately, Bene's fastball smashed into 
Bradbury's right hand, which he'd somehow wrapped too far around the barrel of 
the bat. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury needed surgery to mend his broken right index finger, and one of 
Loyola's most dangerous bats was missing from the lineup for three weeks. But 
when Bradbury came back, he returned a wiser man -- and recovered to hit .486 
down the stretch in West Coast Athletic Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury has picked up this season where he left off. He's batting .381, and 
his 20 doubles are only three shy of Don Sparks' school record. And he's third 
in the WCAC with 59 hits. 
</P>
<P>
None of them are bunts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do that anymore," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
But it's what Bradbury does do on the baseball field that has professional 
scouts flocking. Before this season, Bradbury was ranked among the top 20 
college prospects in the nation by both Sport Magazine and Bill Mazeroski's 
Baseball Annual. And it's a good bet that Bradbury will be drafted high this 
season and will forfeit his final season at Loyola to join the pro ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to go out and see what pro ball has to offer," Bradbury said. "I'd 
like to give it a shot. You know, ever since you're a little kid you want to 
play pro ball. So it's time to go out and start playing it." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury was drafted once before -- in June, 1986, by the Philadelphia 
Phillies, after he wrapped up a stellar prep career at San Diego's Mt. Carmel 
High School. In his three years at Mt. Carmel, Bradbury hit .427 with 17 homers 
and 87 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradbury said no to the Phillies and said yes to Loyola Marymount, then 
ranked No. 1 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I just didn't think I was ready for the pros," said the 
21-year-old Bradbury. "The people here gave me a family type atmosphere that I 
don't think I would have found in pro ball. There were people here I could 
relate to, people all working hard and coming from the same point." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury hit .345 with four homers his freshman year. The next year, after the 
slow start and injury, Bradbury posted an identical .345 average, with 10 home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
He started off a bit slowly this season, but Bradbury admitted it may have been 
because he was pressing too much with all the attention focused on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling a lot of pressure," he said. "But I had a talk with God and 
realized that all the little things -- like all of the scouts, worrying about 
how high I would be drafted -- were all gonna take care of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
So Bradbury, a very serious and religious young man, is set about trying to 
help his team win the WCAC title and earn another trip to the NCAA Regional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola couldn't find a hotter man to ignite their offense from the middle of 
the batting order. Bradbury is 10-for-20 over the last six games, and has hit 
four of his five home runs in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (22-18 overall, 6-1 in the WCAC) are coming off a four-game sweep of 
the University of San Diego and a split against UC Irvine. Loyola plays St. 
Mary's at Moraga this weekend in a four-game WCAC series. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off shaky, but we've got as good a chance as anyone to win our 
conference," Bradbury said. "When we're playing like we can, we're as good as 
anybody in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury wasn't the only Loyola player pressing at the beginning of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had new coaches and new players coming in," Bradbury said. "It was a 
transition stage for everyone. But we've overcome the adversity. It was a 
blessing in disguise that we struggled so much at the beginning. We already 
know how to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury experienced a similar early slump this summer in the Alaskan Summer 
League, when he and Loyola third baseman Rick Allen were teammates on the 
Fairbanks Goldpanners. But Bradbury fought off some nagging injuries to have a 
solid summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I learned in Fairbanks was how to take care of my body," 
Bradbury said. "I was catching every day, so I was learning what I could do -- 
and what I couldn't do -- to stay in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury even got to do a little pitching in Alaska. He concedes that he 
doesn't have much more than a fastball and a change-up. But at 6-4, 210, 
sometimes all you need is intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
"I love catching, being involved, getting dirty," Bradbury said. "But I 
wouldn't mind pitching. I guess it's the same old scenario where all the 
pitchers wish they could hit and all the players wish they could pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Just don't let him bunt.

A NUMBERS GAME LEAVES PUNTER FACING LONG ODDS IN BID FOR NFL JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Numbers. Imagine a world without them. 
</P>
<P>
The official NASA countdown for a launch would sound like this: "Some. Fewer. 
Very few. Not many at all now. Here we go . . . it's outta here!" 
</P>
<P>
The sign over the express checkout line at a supermarket would read: "Not too 
many items or less." 
</P>
<P>
A police officer would say to a speeding motorist: "Sir, you were going Real 
Fast in a Not-Too-Fast zone, I think. Could I see your license and 
registration, please?" 
</P>
<P>
There would, however, be some nice qualities to a life without numbers. In such 
a world Pete Rose, for example, would likely have spent more time teaching his 
players how to hit a baseball and less time with his nose jammed against a 
parimutuel window. 
</P>
<P>
For most of us, though, numbers are a subtle blend of good and bad. We could do 
without some of them but couldn't live a day without others. 
</P>
<P>
Take Trent Morgan. The former Cal State Northridge punter has a recurring dream 
about playing in the NFL. And his fate will be determined almost entirely by 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the good numbers for Morgan: 
</P>
<P>
His punting average last season of 43.5 yards ranked him eighth in the nation 
in the NCAA. Six of those who finished ahead of him played at Division I 
schools. Only one player from a Division II school finished ahead of him, and 
he was from the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., altitude 5,200 feet, 
which translates into a kicked football traveling considerably farther than if 
kicked at sea level. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six Division I punters who finished ahead of him, two kicked in places 
where the altitude also was a major factor -- the University of Colorado in 
Boulder and BYU in Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Morgan's 43.5 average would have given him a tie for fourth place last 
season in the NFL with the Indianapolis Colts' Rohn Stark. His longest punt of 
the season at CSUN, a booming 70-yarder, would have tied him for first place in 
the NFL last season with Mike Horan of the Denver Broncos and Bryan Wagner of 
the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the bad numbers for Morgan and his dream: 
</P>
<P>
There are only 26 NFL teams. And there are usually no more than two or three 
punting vacancies in a season. Thus, of the 309 young men who regularly punted 
footballs for a Division I or Division II college football team last season, 
roughly 306 of them had better hope that they mixed in a little studying during 
their collegiate days because they are about to enter the real job market. 
</P>
<P>
But for a few of them, this week is dream week. The NFL will hold its annual 
draft next Sunday and Monday, and perhaps two or three will be drafted in the 
very late rounds. Others will hit the free-agency trail, begging for a chance 
to show their stuff in an NFL training camp. Very few will succeed along either 
route. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year there were five punters drafted out of college, but that was a very 
unusual year," Los Angeles Rams kicking coach Artie Gigantino said. "A lot of 
teams had punters of the age that they wanted to bring in a young guy to 
challenge them. It was a freak year. On the average, three punters are drafted 
each year." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan believes, though, that his number will come up during a free-agent 
tryout. He already has had tryouts for the Los Angeles Raiders, Green Bay 
Packers and Detroit Lions. None will say how he did or whether they will 
actively pursue him, but Morgan said that the Packers have shown the most 
interest. And well they should, what with Don Bracken, last year's punter, who 
finished next to last in the NFC with a paltry 38.7 punting average. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Lions, with Jim Arnold -- the NFC's leading punter -- signed to a 
contract, would show any interest in a Division II punter remains a mystery. 
And Jeff Gossett of the Raiders had a respectable year, finishing sixth in the 
AFC with a 41.8-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with numbers for Morgan: This year, the NFL will limit the 
number of players a team can bring to training camp to 80. Before, there was no 
maximum and teams often brought as many as 10 punters and kickers into camp to 
fight it out. 
</P>
<P>
So what is Morgan to think? What is Morgan to do with all of these conflicting 
and confusing signals? Well, Morgan plans to do what the average person would 
do when he can't figure something out: He will drop back and punt. 
</P>
<P>
"I know free agency will be the road I take," said the 5-foot-10, 165-pound 
Morgan, who works out daily on the CSUN campus. "The Packers told me they had a 
great need at this position and that they were definitely interested in me. But 
they also said there was much greater need at other positions as far as the 
draft was concerned. They said there were more important people to be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
"But they said if no one else drafts me, they'd like to have me in camp. And I 
am thinking very positive. If I can just get on a field during a game situation 
and show them what I can do, I know I can make it." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan does, however, know the greatest obstacle: the dreaded numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even as confident as I am, I realize it won't be easy," he said. "I know 
there's only one position on each team, that you're either the starter at that 
position or you're off the team. There are no second-string punters. You're 
either the No. 1 guy or you go back home and wait for another telephone call." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Bob Burt watched Morgan develop last season under the guidance of 
CSUN assistant coach Rich Lopez after the punter transferred from L. A. Harbor 
junior college. He said Morgan got consistently better with each game and that 
the punter continues to improve almost daily in his workouts at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"Trent has legitimate NFL leg strength and hang time, and he drives the ball 
really well," Burt said. "I can't imagine anyone much better in college. He is 
a legitimate NFL prospect. Maybe he'll go in the late rounds of the draft, but 
more likely he'll get free-agent tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL looks for hang time, leg strength and athletic ability, and Trent's 
got those things." 
</P>
<P>
But even Burt, Morgan's biggest fan, knows what the numbers mean. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with all of his assets, the problem with making it to the NFL is that 
somebody has to like you," he said. "Somebody from an NFL team has to see you 
and like you and push for you to make it. There are a lot of very good football 
players who never get a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"And with punters, with there being just one per team, it becomes a real crap 
shoot. You think of how many college punters there are and there are just 26 
jobs in the NFL and very few of those jobs are open each season . . . those are 
long, long odds." 
</P>
<P>
And spending time at junior college and Division II football programs won't 
help Morgan's chances, either, although Gigantino of the Rams, who said he had 
never heard of Morgan, offered that playing for a small school as a punter 
might not be such a big liability. 
</P>
<P>
"A punter and kicker are in a different situation than the other players," he 
said. "Punting and kicking are very individual skills. My feeling is that if 
you can punt, you can punt. With linemen from small schools you wonder what 
they'll do against much better competition, but with kickers and punters I 
don't think it's a concern at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The only possible concern is how a kid from a small school who played before a 
few hundred or a few thousand fans will react in front of 75,000 fans. You 
wonder a bit about their ability to perform consistently under big-time 
pressure because they've never been in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
But with all the possibility for failure, Morgan remains confident. And one 
reason is that he holds in his mind a trump card named Bryan Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, the Bears' highly successful punter last season who was ranked eighth 
in the NFL with a 41.5-yard average, also played at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner is CSUN's all-time leading punter with a 43.7-yard average in 1983. He 
banged around the fringes of the NFL for four years, being cut more often than 
a man shaving with an electric hedge trimmer before making it big with the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner's average at CSUN was a scant two-tenths of a yard better than Morgan's. 
And Morgan figures the difference -- less than the length of a football -- is 
not enough to keep him from chasing his dream. 
</P>
<P>
"I never met Bryan Wagner, but I sure know about him," Morgan said. "If he did 
it from CSUN, I know I can do it, too."

<P>
FRUSTRATION OF FOUR NARROW LOSSES FADES IN 5-2 CONFERENCE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
John Herbold was just about at the end of his rope. Four times this season his 
Cal State Los Angeles baseball team had been on the verge of beating Cal State 
Northridge, only to see the Matadors pull out a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles had been beaten three times by one run -- including once in the 
ninth inning and once in the 10th -- and had also lost a two-run decision to 
Northridge. It was getting so frustrating for Herbold that he was thrown out of 
Friday's 10-inning loss to the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
But the Matador magic finally disappeared Saturday as the Golden Eagles 
defeated Northridge, 5-2, in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering if it was ever going to end with those guys," Herbold said. 
</P>
<P>
It did Saturday, in the regular-season finale between the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman left-hander Paul Spere (4-1), making only his second conference start, 
scattered eight hits to pick up the complete-game victory. Spere, who threw 
just 94 pitches, struck out two and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to change speeds and keep the ball down," said Spere, who is 
2-0 and has allowed just three runs in conference play . 
</P>
<P>
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen summed up the defeat simply: "If we hit, we win. 
If we don't, we lose. We got no production from the middle or top of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles did. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles (18-22 overall, 8-9 in conference play) erased a 1-0 deficit 
in the third inning. William Silvan singled under third baseman Denny Vigo's 
glove, Frank James followed with a double and Rex De La Nuez, batting third in 
the lineup, cleared the bases with a three-run home run to left field off 
Matador starter Vale Lopez (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
"I think Denny should have made the play," Kernen said. "It's a reaction thing. 
You either get it or you don't." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN (20-12, 9-8-1) got one run back in the fourth when Chae-Ho Chong was hit 
by a pitch, took second on a wild pitch and scored on Vigo's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Golden Eagles touched Lopez for another run in the seventh and added a 
fifth run, in the eighth, off reliever Dan Cory. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez went 6 1/3 innings, allowing five hits and four earned runs before 
leaving with a sore shoulder.

SPANGLER HOLDS OFF TRACK VETERANS AT SAUGUS FOR 1ST WIN 
</P>

Keith Spangler found himself ahead of some really big wheels with eight laps 
remaining in Saturday night's NASCAR Sportsman "40" before a crowd of 3,697 at 
Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler, a 19-year-old track sophomore from Northridge, cruised around the 
one-third-mile oval under a yellow flag, leading the pack and quite likely 
licking his chops at the prospect of taking his first career checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Spangler had to be glancing in his rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
In second place was Gary Sigman of Carson, currently atop the Sportsman 
Division standings three weeks into the season and winner of the evening's 
trophy dash. 
</P>
<P>
In third was three-time defending Sportsman champion Dave Phipps of Simi 
Valley, currently sixth behind Spangler in the standings and winless thus far 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was experience that yielded to youth -- though only by the margin of a 
bumper. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler withstood a second yellow flag and hard charges by both Sigman and 
Phipps to take the flag and increase his lead over Phipps, which stood at seven 
points when the evening began. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was as good as they were," Spangler said. "They're only human. So 
am I. I just tried to drive as hard as I could. That's about all you can hope 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Spangler moved into the lead for good when Jim Morrill of Lancaster spun out on 
Lap 17 and surrendered the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park's Doug Renno posted his first career victory in dramatic fashion, 
winning the 25-lap Hobby Stock oval main event over Brian Kelley of Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
A nudge from Kelley nearly forced Renno to spin out in Turn 4 of the final lap. 
But Renno's tires held and he beat Kelley to the flag by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley lamented Saugus' inverted starting system, which places fast qualifiers 
in the rear in order to promote a more competitive contest. "Starting in the 
back," he said, shaking his head. "By the time you get to the front, the race 
is over." 
</P>
<P>
Kelley moved steadily through the pack until moving into second on Lap 16. 
Renno had assumed an eight-car-length lead, but a yellow flag on Lap 23, caused 
by Scott Roark of Agua Dulce slamming into a wall, set up a trophy dash to the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"One more lap," Kelley said. "Oh, man, I was trying so hard. But he held good." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Barreras Jr. of Canyon Country won the 15-lap, Hobby Stock figure 8 main 
event.

One swing by Royal High center fielder Jason Jones swung the outcome of a 
third-round Redondo-Palos Verdes baseball tournament game against visiting 
Alemany to the Highlanders, 8-6, Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the sixth inning and the score tied, 6-6, the Highlander senior 
drilled a one-and-two pitch by starter Matt Delavigne over the left-field fence 
for a two-run home run. The home run was Jones' fourth of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Delavigne (0-3), a right-hander, threw eight wild pitches and walked seven -- 
four in the third inning -- and allowed seven earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany's Joey Rosselli, in his second game after recovering from a fractured 
bone in his left hand, hit a home run with two on in the sixth to bring the 
Indians (11-9) back from a three-run deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli also hit a home run Wednesday in his first game, a 3-1 win over Crespi 
in which he pitched a three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
There was no similar muzzling of Royal, which sent nine batters to the plate in 
the fifth and scored four runs on five hits to take a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Will Egan singled to lead off the inning and scored on a double by James Jones, 
who was three for four with two runs batted in. Sean Mitchell walked and Jason 
Jones, James' twin, singled to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Naranjo hit a run-scoring single and, with one out, Mitchell scored on a 
wild pitch to push the Highlanders (9-12) ahead, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Bernstein loaded the bases with a single and Dennis Gildehaus' squeeze 
bunt scored Jason Jones for Royal's final run of the inning. MIKE GLAZE In 
other baseball games: Thousand Oaks 9, Muir 0 -- Junior first baseman Scott 
Barkman was three for three with two home runs, a double and seven RBIs for the 
Lancers in the third-round game of the De La Salle tournament at Muir. Barkman 
drove in Thousand Oaks' first seven runs with a three-run home run in the first 
inning, an RBI ground-rule double in the third and another three-run home run 
in the fourth. Pitchers John Bushart, Tony Siegal and Brian Snyder combined for 
a five-hitter as Thousand Oaks improved to 8-7. Notre Dame 6, Gahr 4 -- The 
Knights scored three runs in the seventh inning of the third-round game of the 
Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament at Gahr. Kevin Crosby singled to open the 
inning and scored from second base on a throwing error after Bruno Paniccia's 
sacrifice bunt. After Bobby Hughes and Kevin Milligan walked, Vinnie Orlando 
singled in Hughes with the winning run. Louie Tapia beat out an infield hit to 
load the bases and Chad Ratliff walked to force in Notre Dame's final run. 
Sophomore pitcher Cary Wichmann improved to 7-0 for Notre Dame (15-2). Wichmann 
gave up 11 hits, struck out six and walked three in 6 1/3 innings. Hughes 
picked up his third save. Crespi 4, Buena Park 0 -- Senior left-hander Mark 
Kurtz threw a two-hitter, walked none and struck out six as Crespi (7-11-2) won 
a third-round consolation-bracket game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament 
at Crespi. Kurtz (1-3) faced one batter over the minimum. Tim Weir and Brodie 
Van Wagonen each had two hits and drove in runs in Crespi's three-run sixth 
inning as the Celts broke open a 1-0 game.BOYS' TRACK Oak Park, behind a pair 
of victories in the relay events, scored 81 points to win the 37-team Russell 
Cup meet at Carpinteria High. Oak Park recorded a meet record 3 minutes, 24.6 
seconds in the 1,600-meter relay behind Rich Frank, Jess Garner, Kent Richter 
and Jason Stein. Frank, Richter, Stein and Brian Kane teamed to win the 
400-meter relay in 43.7. Richter won the 200 meters in 22.7, Garner took 110 
high hurdles in 15.6 and Stein won the 300 intermediate hurdles in 40.1. In the 
field events, Mitch Harris was second in the long jump at 20 feet, 7 inches and 
third in the triple jump at 39-7 1/2.BOYS' VOLLEYBALL Campbell Hall d. 
Windward, 15-13, 18-16, 15-6 -- Will Fruehling had 20 kills and Don White 16 
for the Vikings (13-1) in a nonleague match at Culver City High.

DON'T SAY HANDICAPPED; 
</P>
<P>
DAN SIEGLER AND JIM ABBOTT EACH HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE IN BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were 46,846 curious people at Anaheim Stadium for the Angels' first 
Saturday night home game. Their curiousity was understandable because pitcher 
Jim Abbott was about to make his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
One fan was not particularly curious, though maybe that was not quite so 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Dan Siegler. He just wanted to watch a ballgame, so much so that 
he turned down three dates to a Sadie Hawkins dance. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, as nearly everybody knows by now, has one hand. Siegler, a senior first 
baseman on the Fallbrook High School baseball team, also was born with one 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the first pitch in Anaheim Stadium, Siegler watched 
photographers cluster around Abbott as he emerged from the dugout. And Siegler 
wondered aloud why people are always so curious. About Abbott. About him. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's hard to understand," he said, watching Abbott warm up. "To me, 
it's like, 'What the hell. It's the way I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, Siegler was just another high school kid playing ball. He 
was a starter for three seasons at Tustin High School in Orange County before 
he transferred to Fallbrook last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Siegler obviously gets considerably less recognition than Abbott, but he has 
gotten some. After last season in Tustin, he received a call from a reporter in 
Orange County who wanted to do a story. Then, in San Diego, another reporter 
called. Then another. 
</P>
<P>
Siegler finds the attention somewhat ironic. He has teammates going to Arizona 
State to play baseball. Nobody has been in touch with them about doing a story. 
Yet Siegler, who does not play a lot and whose competitive baseball career 
probably will end after this season, is creating something of a stir. 
</P>
<P>
So as Abbott pitched, Siegler said several times to the reporter sitting next 
to him: "I think this is the last interview like this I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Siegler doesn't consider himself a good story. Or even a story at all. He's 
just a guy who plays on a team. An average high school student who gets lazy 
now and then, isn't afraid to put a cocky freshman in his place, likes teachers 
who encourage students to form their own opinions, tells an occasional joke and 
turns up the radio when a Guns and Roses song comes on. 
</P>
<P>
The word handicap isn't mentioned when Siegler is talking. He just lives and 
plays ball using the tools he was given. He has never spent time worrying about 
what he can and can't do or what he might be able to do if things were 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever picked on me," he says. "Probably because they don't notice. 
Your friends aren't going to rag on you. They don't say, 'This is my friend. 
He's got only two fingers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Siegler plays about the same way the left-handed Abbott does, in his case 
catching with his right hand and shifting his glove over when he throws. 
Because he has one finger and a thumb on his left hand, he uses it for support 
when he bats. And that's that. It's as natural for him as falling asleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been asked the question if it's tough or not," he says. "I'd have to say, 
'No.' It's normal for me. I guess that's why I don't understand why people ask 
the questions they ask. I must be doing something different, but it's not 
different for me." 
</P>
<P>
Siegler, 18, would just as soon not get any extra attention. If he were as good 
as Abbott, he would have to learn to cope with the constant clicking of 
cameras, the endless interviews and the same questions over and over. When 
Abbott trotted to the mound and photographers scrambled anywhere they could get 
a picture, Siegler slid to the edge of his seat and said: "That would bug me." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott is not Siegler's hero. Never was. Siegler hasn't followed Abbott's 
career closely or tried to emulate his style of play. Siegler hadn't even heard 
of Abbott until his father, Paul Siegler, told him there was a one-handed 
pitcher on the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look up to Abbott," says Siegler, matter of factly. "He's just another 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get the wrong impression. Siegler credits Abbott for his success. But not 
for the same reason most people do. Siegler is impressed because Abbott is a 
major league player, the same way he is impressed with Don Mattingly or any 
other professional player. That Abbott has one hand is seemingly of little 
consequence. 
</P>
<P>
And his observations at the ballpark support that. He doesn't focus on Abbott. 
A foul ball gets ripped into the stands. Siegler smiles and shakes his head. 
"People are so crazy trying to catch that ball with their bare hands. Do they 
know how fast that thing is going?" A player's batting average is flashed on 
the screen. "This guy's batting 1.000. Probably one for one," Siegler says, 
drawing a laugh from someone sitting behind him. 
</P>
<P>
It's fairly obvious, though, that Siegler is pulling for Abbott, just like 
everybody else. He'll point out Abbott's fastball has been clocked at 94 miles 
per hour, which, he says, is "good enough for the show here." When Abbott 
departed in the fifth inning of a rather inauspicious debut, Siegler said: "I 
think he did pretty well for a first major league start. He did what a pitcher 
is supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
The fans gave Abbott a standing ovation as he walked off the field. No one 
clapped louder than Siegler. 
</P>
<P>
After Abbott had disappeared into the dugout, Siegler said: "(The fans) are 
wondering about how Abbott does. They have a right to be curious. Let them get 
their curiosity out of the way and look at him as a regular ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Siegler wants it. Treat him the same as everybody else. His 
coach, Dan Heid, does. Siegler says he gets yelled at just like the rest of the 
players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Siegler's spot on the roster isn't charity. He's hitting .333, 
including a bases-loaded triple against El Camino. Heid says there's no one 
with a dirtier uniform after practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He has definitely earned his way on the team by being one of the 16 best 
players at Fallbrook High," Heid said. 
</P>
<P>
Siegler accepts his role. Winning, he says, can be just as satisfying from the 
bench. A win is a win. But there are trying times. The plays where it takes him 
a little too long to get the ball out of his glove and into his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"When he messes up, he gets really frustrated," said teammate John Clift, who 
once served up a home run ball to Siegler in Pony League. "He takes it pretty 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
He always has. For that reason, his father used to encourage him to play 
soccer. He knew Dan would always drive himself to succeed and figured he 
wouldn't be at a disadvantage on the soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to keep him away from (baseball)," Paul Siegler said. "We didn't want 
to see him fail." 
</P>
<P>
But baseball was Siegler's favorite. So he gave up soccer, stuck with baseball 
and made a go of it. Deep down, Paul says, Dan has something he wants to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do anything anybody else can do and I'll do it just as well . . . or at 
least I'll try," says Dan, adding quickly, "I'm not trying to sound stuck on 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
He rarely does. Siegler doesn't appear overly impressed with himself. He talks 
of being an average student and speaks highly of his younger brother Philip, 
who is a good baseball player and a good student. Siegler is outgoing and 
friendly, enjoys meeting people. 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't really consider himself an inspiration for others with 
handicaps. That's not because he doesn't care. He once spent a week showing a 
kid who also had only one hand how to catch and throw a baseball. But when he 
plays, he just plays. Nothing more, nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go up to bat thinking, 'I have to do this to inspire somebody,' " he 
says. "I don't want to sound like a bad person. I just want to play the game." 
</P>

A 'SHAKY' BRENT NOON THROWS SHOT 67-8 1/2 TO BREAK 15-YEAR-OLD MARK

<P>
Brent Noon, his legs "still a little shaky" from a recent bout with the flu, 
was feeling a little buzz at the Sundevil Invitational at Poway High School 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Noon, competing for the first time in three weeks, set a new section record 
with a put of 67-8 1/2, beating the record 65-11 1/4 set by El Cajon Valley's 
Curt Hampton in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The throw also was a national best this year. 
</P>
<P>
For Noon, it was just a matter of time. The Fallbrook High junior already had 
put the shot 66-4 1/2 at an indoor meet in Idaho and says he has been clearing 
70 feet consistently in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Noon said he felt little pressure to set the mark. In fact, the pressure of 
competing at Poway High, with a shot put ring that historically has given Noon 
fits, played in Noon's mind more than the record. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, that I threw well here, that's the main pressure off me," Noon said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Noon sprained an ankle at the same ring from which he set his record 
Saturday. Apparently, the footboard was not at regulation height a year ago. 
Instead of breaking his inertia against it, Noon tripped over it and injured 
his ankle in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the footboard has been raised to regulation height, Noon 
did have his troubles. He fouled on his first two throws of the day, the second 
of which looked a bit longer than the record put. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was maybe 68 (feet)," Noon said. "But I can't say I didn't foul." 
</P>
<P>
With the section record behind him, Brent Noon might be expected to take a 
couple days to rest on his laurels. Nothing doing. Noon still has his goals of 
a 73-foot shot put and a discus throw over 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's business as usual," Noon said. "I'm still going to go home today and 
practice and lift." 
</P>
<P>
Before Noon went home to "practice and lift," he stayed long enough to set a 
new personal best in the discus and took first place with a toss of 174-10. 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, Noon was named the field athlete of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Noon, however, was not the only San Diego athlete to shine during the day. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual distance runner Francis O'Neil neared his personal best time in the 
1,600 meters of 1:53 by turning in a 1:54.1. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's Jeff Haines, running against a head wind of 2 1/2 meters per second, 
ran a 15.1 in the 110 high hurdles, just barely edging Carson's Curtis Hawkins. 
Both Hawkins and Haines had clocked 14.9s earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen's Lenny McGill eclipsed his personal best in the triple jump by 
going 48-11 1/2. McGill, however, finished second place behind the 50-foot jump 
of DeAndre Roberson of West Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, triple jumper Rachelle Johnson from Patrick Henry jumped 
39-4 to win and eclipse her previous best by an inch. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1,600 meters, Rancho Buena Vista High's Kira Jorgensen was expecting a 
rematch with Palos Verdes' Ashley Black, who beat Jorgensen just two weeks ago 
in the Pasadena Games. This time, however, Black did not show and Jorgensen won 
in 5:00.9. 
</P>
<P>
Poway hurdler Kim Dill pulled off a double, first taking the 100 low hurdles in 
15.1 and then outclassing the field in the 300 low hurdles to win at 45.3 
</P>
<P>
There was some added interest in the boys' sprint events where the No. 1 
Australian sprinter, Paul Henderson, was entered. Henderson, however, was 
nudged by Long Beach Poly's Andre Green, 10.8 to 10.9. 
</P>
<P>
"I slipped at the start," Henderson said, "but I felt I had the kick to win if 
it wasn't for that bad start." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson came back to win the top heat in the 200 meters in 21.7. Green placed 
second with the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian said he expected to place well against his American competition. 
And why not, his top 200 time of 21.13 is better than that of Australia's 
representative in the Olympics (Darren Clirk has a 21.25, according to 
Henderson). 
</P>
<P>
"That makes you feel really confident and good inside," Henderson said.

HOLLY FARR CHASES OLYMPIC DREAM

<P>
Making the mental connection between biathlon, a sport with roots in 
Scandinavian hunting techniques, and Dulzura, a quiet town set among the brush 
and scrub oaks of southeastern San Diego County, is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Farr is the connection. She is using the summer biathlon as a stepping 
stone for a comeback in the winter version. 
</P>
<P>
Farr, 32, will be among those competing in the West Coast Championship of 
Summer Biathlon at the South Bay Rod and Gun Club in Dulzura at 8 a.m. today. 
The event combines running and shooting, rather than the winter biathlon's 
cross-country skiing and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Farr, a member of the bronze medal winning U.S. women's biathlon relay team at 
the 1984 World Championships, will continue her comeback from frozen lungs she 
suffered while competing in a winter biathlon in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Farr's problems started at the tryouts for the U.S. team in 1985. The tryouts 
were supposed to be held on the East Coast, but they were moved to Quebec for 
better snow conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Overexertion in sub-zero weather with high humidity caused Farr to suffer from 
frozen lungs. And she was forced to push herself because balky ammunition was 
causing her to fall steadily behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't find any ammo that would shoot," Farr said. "I had to take a bore 
brush and put the ammo in at each stop. I got mad and I tried to make up for 
(it) with my skiing. When it's that cold, you have to cut back." 
</P>
<P>
She didn't discover the damage to her lungs until later, when she tried to work 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wheezing all the time and at first I thought it was pollen," Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
After some tests it was discovered that Farr had indeed suffered frozen lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of the crumble," Farr said. "I was going through some 
personal things -- family things. But things happen. You have to figure your 
luck is going to change." 
</P>
<P>
Farr is working her way back, trying to get into shape. She competed in the 
women's National Biathlon Championships last year, but finished out of the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
"I could be discouraged," Farr said. "I wanted to find out where I was now that 
I'm not in my best shape." 
</P>
<P>
She is currently running track at MiraCosta Community College, where she also 
ran cross country last year. Farr divides her time between San Diego and Lake 
Tahoe, where she works on her skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, in fact, she aspired to be an alpine skier. 
</P>
<P>
"(The coaches) told me I was basically over the hill in my early 20s," said 
Farr. "And I was just getting good at it." 
</P>
<P>
While working at the Olympic center in Squaw Valley, Farr was introduced to 
biathlon. 
</P>
<P>
"I went along with the (men's team) for an event and a guy hands me a rifle and 
said, 'Look, there's an extra rifle, why don't you race?' " Farr said. "I 
missed the first five and then I hit four of the next five and I got hooked." 
</P>
<P>
She was starting to get hooked at about the time women were starting to get 
involved in winter biathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Though biathlon has been an Olympic sport for men since 1960, the first major 
international competition for women wasn't until the 1984 world championships. 
The sport will be added for women at the 1992 Winter Olympics in France. 
</P>
<P>
That hooked Farr again and got her thinking of a comeback after two years away 
from competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics is a big carrot," Farr said. "I love being an athlete and I 
discovered it too late in life. But I don't think age matters that much. The 
important thing is being healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at this as my last chance. I feel like I tumbled and went out on a low 
note. I'd like to go out on a higher note. I want to come back and prove to 
myself, if nobody else, that I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
And so she is in Dulzura today, doing a different sort of biathlon. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer version, competitors make two stops to shoot at five knock-down 
targets. The summer targets are about the size of a softball and are set at 25 
meters, as opposed to the winter's smaller targets set at 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to hit them," said Farr. "Most people are beginners who try 
this. We don't want to make it too hard." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the summer biathlon, which started in earnest last year with a 
six-city tour, is to a acquaint people with a traditionally winterized sport. 
This year, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the U.S. Biathlon Assn. 
are sponsoring a 10-city tour culminating with the national championships in 
October in St. Louis. San Diego is the second stop. 
</P>
<P>
Of course Farr, who recently won the first summer event in Phoenix, has a 
reason for being in this dusty community today: She is trying to find winter.

SUPERVISOR CAN VOTE ON MALIBU PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
SCHABARUM STOCK QUERY RESOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County counsel's office has declared that Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum has no financial interest in a company that is developing a 
controversial $150-million project in Malibu and that he can vote on the 
proposal if it reaches the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion released Thursday, Assistant County Counsel Roberta M. Fesler 
also said Schabarum's votes last year as a member of the Local Agency Formation 
Commission against Malibu cityhood were not a conflict of interest. 
Incorporation would be expected to greatly slow construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about whether Schabarum should vote on matters relating to VMS 
Realty, co-developer of the large Malibu project, were raised 10 days ago, when 
he disclosed in his annual statement of economic interest that he holds stock 
worth between $20,000 and $200,000 in a limited partnership managed by VMS 
Realty. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based company and the Anden Group of Sherman Oaks are partners in 
the Rancho Malibu venture, which would include 62 luxury homes, a golf course, 
club house, tennis courts and a restaurant along Encinal Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schabarum's investment in VMS Mortgage Investors Limited Partnership 
III has no direct financial link to the Malibu project, state Fair Political 
Practices Commission guidelines on conflict of interest generally consider 
parent companies and their subsidiaries as one firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Closely Held' 
</P>
<P>
Citing a 1983 FPPC ruling, however, Fesler said that since the limited 
partnership is publicly traded, not "closely held" by its managing company, 
Schabarum could vote on the VMS proposal without a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
When limited partnerships are publicly traded, "the individual limited partners 
are basing their investment decision on the viability and value of the business 
transaction, not on the skill of the general partner," she said. "Thus, such an 
investment does not create a financial interest in either the general partner 
or any other business entities controlled by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Your investment," she concluded, "does not prohibit your participation in 
actions by LAFCO or the Board of Supervisors, which have a material financial 
effect on VMS or other business entities controlled by it, including the 
partnership for the proposed development" in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Malibu project is still before the Planning Commission and has not 
been considered by county supervisors, Schabarum twice voted as a LAFCO member 
against Malibu incorporation. In another LAFCO vote he opposed VMS/Anden's 
request that its property be excluded from the area within the new city's 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Benell, LAFCO's executive director, has said she will also seek a ruling 
on Schabarum's votes from the independent counsel chosen to handle the pending 
Malibu incorporation. But she said the issue may be moot, because a Superior 
Court judge has rescinded LAFCO's approval of Malibu's cityhood petition and 
the incorporation process must start over.

DESIGNER RIDES HIGH WITH WESTERN CLOTHES

<P>
When Jerry Cohn realized his wardrobe would not be complete without a pair of 
denim boots, he did not think twice about where to go -- he took his unusual 
request to his designer of the last 10 years, Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my idea," said Cohn, who manages the careers of such stars as Barbara 
Stanwyck, Cesar Romero and Rose Marie. "I said, 'I've got a great idea . . . 
How about making me a pair of denim boots?' But he'd already thought of it on 
his own. He pulled out a pair and said, 'You mean like these?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who sees my Levi boots says, 'Gee, what a great idea!' " said Cohn, 
who paid $800 to fulfill his sartorial fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Clients 
</P>
<P>
Manuel, who uses no last name, is renowned among fanciers of Western-style 
clothing. The 55-year-old designer, working out of his North Hollywood store 
that bears his name, has put together wardrobes for such high-profile 
entertainers as Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakum, Randy Travis and Emmylou Harris. 
Sylvester Stallone and Bob Dylan have purchased his brightly colored jackets, 
made from Indian blankets. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize that they've been wearing Western clothes all along -- 
jeans and Levi jackets are all Western-American clothes," Manuel said. "The 
American heritage, the settlers, the Army, the real Indian costumes, the 
weavings and patterns. I have absorbed all this and put it on the clothing. I 
try to follow the American tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel, who was born in Michoacan, Mexico, said he started sewing "odd ends and 
shirts" when he was 8. When he moved to this country 34 years ago, he went to 
work for men's clothier Sy Devore. 
</P>
<P>
"I started working in several of Sy Devore's shops," he said, "but he made 
nothing but the regular clothes. Nothing got fancier than the regular suits. I 
was looking for something more than that." 
</P>
<P>
After just a few months with Sy Devore, he went to work for a North 
Hollywood-based clothing designer named Nudi, who specialized in Western 
clothing. "Country and Western was Nudi's clientele," Manuel said. "He used 
embroidery and rhinestones. I incorporated a little more than he had. It gave 
the clothes a more sophisticated look." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Movie Costumes 
</P>
<P>
While working at Nudi's, Manuel started to create movie costumes. He clothed 
the characters in movies such as "Myra Breckenridge," "Xanadu" and 
"Rhinestone," but said the work was not satisfying. "I don't like to deal with 
the character of the so-called movie star. Sometimes my way of thinking 
interfered with that. I don't believe in ego stuff. I believe in 
professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel left Nudi's 14 years ago to set up his own shop. And in the past few 
years, he has phased out of movie costuming entirely. 
</P>
<P>
He looks askance at Americans who wear imported, European-tailored clothing. "I 
don't think Americans should wear Italian- or French-made suits," he said. 
"Those people are built so differently. When Americans wear those clothes, they 
look like they've been wrapped like a mummy." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to traditional materials such as cotton, wool, denim, silk, suede 
and leather, Manuel also uses blankets made by New Mexico's Chimayo Indians. 
Manuel turns them into striking coats that sell for $4,000 and up. "Bob Dylan 
has a $7,500 jacket made out of one of these blankets, Sylvester Stallone has 
one, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel also sells sterling silver jewelry embedded with turquoise, coral or 
rubies; hand-tooled belts; hand-embroidered or hand-tooled leather or fabric 
boots; and blouses, shirts, jackets, dresses, and suits that are usually 
embroidered, fringed or trimmed with rhinestones. Prices range from $200 to 
four figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Store Shows Style 
</P>
<P>
His open, airy store, with its blond hardwood floors, provides more evidence of 
his sense of style. Manuel embroidered the pillows that are artfully tossed on 
the sand-colored couches. He also fringed and tooled Indian designs into the 
store's smattering of antique chairs and he painted the Western mural on a 
partition near the back of the store. "I did do a couple of chairs for Johnny 
Cash, and for Elvis," he said, "but I prefer to do clothes and jewelry. Really, 
the chairs and pillows are just for myself, to liven up the store." 
</P>
<P>
The walls are covered with gold records sent by singing celebrities and rows 
and rows of photographs of smiling celebrities in Manuel-designed outfits. "I 
made the first Western suit that John Lennon ever wore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clients arrange to meet with Manuel in his store by appointment only. And his 
clothes, like his service, are so personalized that Manuel always makes a point 
of sewing a label that says "Designed For (blank) By Manuel" into each garment. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Landon, former wife of actor-producer Michael Landon, has been going to 
Manuel for 15 years. "I discovered him when he was working at Nudi's," she 
said. "I love his country and Western clothes. If I wear jeans, I'll have a 
jacket or coat or vest that's country and Western. He did the dress I wore when 
my son got married. It's a blue silk, then there's a design in rhinestones on 
the back of a cropped jacket." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looks Like Art' 
</P>
<P>
Landon also owns one of Manuel's Indian blanket coats. "He did an Indian 
blanket coat for me and added little beads. I wore it in New York City, and 
people said, 'Where did you get that coat?' A lot of people think his work 
looks like art." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel is now working on a black Western jacket for Landon. "It's from a very 
old design," she said. "I think to wear it with a little black dress and heels 
would be fabulous, but it's also a jacket you could wear with a pair of jeans." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn said Manuel's designs fit his casual sense of style. "I wear a lot of 
boots and jeans and suits," he said. "He makes my regular suits, and he's also 
made a tuxedo for me. It's a velvet jacket with a twill vest, twill slacks and 
no buttons, no pockets. I wear that with black, patent leather sandals and no 
socks -- that's my style." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very comfortable there in his store. Even if his store were a warehouse, 
you'd still feel good being there. He makes you feel special." 
</P>

GOOD LOOKS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO CAPTURE TIARA IN TODAY'S PAGEANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anna Marie Dalmatin hugged last year's champion, cradled a dozen red roses, 
adjusted her rhinestone tiara and began the traditional winner's walk. 
</P>
<P>
There she went, the new Miss Northridge, down the long, narrow runway at the 
Odyssey Restaurant in Granada Hills. It was the first formal duty of a one-year 
reign that will include ribbon cuttings, charity functions and civic 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when I'll climb down from my cloud," said Dalmatin, 18, shortly 
after winning the pageant last week. "I didn't think I did that well." 
</P>
<P>
The judges did. They liked her speech, her poise, her swimsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"My eye goes right to her," said Marjorie Goodson Cutt, the hostess on "Classic 
Concentration," a television game show. "She didn't try to be the seductress. 
She's wholesome, not a Barbie doll." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin, pageant veterans say, is typical of today's beauty contestant: 
attractive, ambitious, articulate. She studies history at College of the 
Canyons in Valencia and dreams of working to improve the environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poise, Intellect 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many pageants have evolved from mere demonstrations of natural physical 
beauty to comprehensive evaluations of a woman's poise, maturity and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Beck, who has worked on dozens of San Fernando Valley pageants, including 
Miss Northridge, for several decades, says women use the contest today as a 
vehicle for career advancement, even in such professions as business and law. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding a more intellectual girl, a girl more interested in a college 
education, in the future," said Beck. "Not the valley girl, bubbly type." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Miss Northridge was crowned, the contestants and crowds departed. 
Someone took down the decorations and special lights. Another beauty pageant 
had begun its fade into memory. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. There will be more pageants next week, and the following week, and 
the week after that. The United States, a land obsessed with looks and grounded 
in ritual, has long counted the beauty contest among its favorite pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carl Dunn, publisher of the Louisiana-based Pageantry Magazine, 
there were over 12,000 contests nationwide last year, with about 3 million 
participants, and that figure doesn't even include independent competitions or 
Junior Miss and baby events. 
</P>
<P>
"Pageants are getting more popular all the time," Dunn said. "And that's 
because of television. Television is the name of the game. There's so much 
money involved these days. Winners can make thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The winners of the state events such as Miss California and Miss Texas can make 
from $60,000 to $90,000 in prizes and scholarships. Miss America can earn 
$350,000 to $450,000 during her yearlong reign. Nationwide, over $15 million in 
scholarships is awarded to beauty pageant winners each year. 
</P>
<P>
A number of valley chambers of commerce sponsor contests -- Granada Hills, 
Tarzana, Sylmar, Tujunga and Northridge among them. Local businesses, such as 
florists, jewelry stores and cosmetic supply outlets, donate merchandise to the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
While the sponsors emphasize the way pageants help to promote a woman's future 
career and build her self-esteem, they acknowledge that contests promote their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Over her bathing suit, evening gown and business attire, each Miss Northridge 
contestant wore her sponsor's name and gave a speech urging the audience to 
look further into the company. 
</P>
<P>
The companies paid $195 to be a sponsor, and many consider the fee to be well 
worth the publicity. Bob Giacobbe, president of Premier Bank in Northridge, 
which sponsored Dalmatin, said: "There's another year of Premier Bank's name 
being out there." 
</P>
<P>
And Premier Bank -- like all other sponsors -- wants an articulate, poised 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Welsh, a writer for Faces International Magazine who has judged dozens 
of pageants, said beauty is no longer enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I always make it a point to ask girls what they think the woman of the '80s 
has meant, and what the woman of the '90s will mean," Welsh said. "A good 
answer to that question is worth a lot of points. And I don't look to see 
whether a girl has a great figure. I look to see if she is physically fit, if 
she knows how to take care of herself." 
</P>
<P>
Some pageants have eliminated the swimsuit competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We see very few occasions where we would need the winners representing us in a 
bathing suit," said Jo Ann Ainsworth, manager of the Sylmar Chamber of 
Commerce. "We are a business organization, and there was no reason to parade 
bathing beauties." 
</P>
<P>
In San Fernando, contestants are required to undertake a community service 
project and write an essay about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
In Chatsworth, Chamber of Commerce members have been adamantly opposed to 
pageants for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We never have had a pageant, and we never will," said Debra Sakacs, the 
chamber manager. "This is a very non-sexist organization, and we don't think a 
young woman should be judged by her looks." 
</P>
<P>
In Sylmar, the chamber sponsors a Mr. Ambassador contest in addition to a Miss 
Sylmar contest, although officials expect only about five contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the sexist stuff about pageants has receded in the valley," said David 
Miller, president of the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce. "It was strong a 
few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Miss Northridge pageant drew 25 contestants and about 320 observers. 
All contestants had to be between 17 and 24 years old, single, without children 
and a resident of the San Fernando Valley for at least six months. Resumes 
could not include professional modeling or acting experience. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the contestants were between 17 and 20, and their reasons for entering 
ranged from fulfilling girlhood dreams of glory to enhancing communication 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Lisa Horn, 18, a senior at Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, 
used to watch beauty pageants on television. She and her mother would write 
down their evaluations and predict the winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be just like Miss America," Horn said during rehearsals. "It's 
inspiring because she's done so much, because she can be so responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Horn's dream faded during her one-minute speech to the audience. After her 
opening statement, Horn stumbled and lost her place. Backstage, after her 
performance, she sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had memorized it so well," Horn said, "but when my boyfriend waved to me, I 
froze." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the other contestants moved in to reassure her. Deborah Stern, last 
year's Miss Northridge, who helped the women through all the rehearsals, told 
Horn to concentrate on the rest of the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
For other contestants, like Eileen Leiner, the dream was not about winning. It 
was about competing in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I am real insecure," said Leiner, 22, during a rehearsal. 
"You have no idea about how hard it is for me to go through this. I feel like 
I'm chubby. Getting in front of all those people in a bathing suit scares me. 
But I already feel better about myself. I've worn conservative clothing, and 
now I just want to go wild." 
</P>
<P>
Leiner, a teacher's aide, didn't finish in the final 10, but that didn't seem 
to matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I belong here," she said. "I learned how to walk, and I learned how to respect 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Wagman said she entered the Miss Northridge contest to further 
develop her speaking skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to show people all I've got without being nervous," Wagman said. "Maybe 
I'm not so good in my bathing suit or evening gown, but instead of wearing a 
hot bathing suit, I want to give a good speech." 
</P>
<P>
(The judges thought Wagman gave a great speech -- which contributed to her 
finish as first runner-up.) 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wagman was concerned about her appearance. During a rehearsal she 
said she was worried that her black evening dress would look "too trashy." 
</P>
<P>
And looks were stressed throughout the contest. During the bathing suit 
competition, the master of ceremonies read the contestant's measurements. At 
rehearsals, pageant instructors repeatedly emphasized the importance of the 
right color of bathing suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't wear black," Deborah Stern told the contestants. "It will make you look 
pale. You want to look hot." 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Ann Frashure, who finished as the first runner-up in Miss Northridge 
1988, spent a whole day at the mall looking for the right bathing suit. She 
finally settled on something in purple. 
</P>
<P>
"When you try on a certain bathing suit and look at it in the mirror, you know 
if it's the right one," Frashure said. "I spent $54 on it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she wasn't looking forward to parading the suit in front of 
hundreds of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"There you are in front of 500 people and your back is to the audience," she 
said. "That's all they're looking at. I don't think a beauty pageant as a whole 
is degrading, but I think that part is degrading." 
</P>
<P>
Many women want to win so badly they come back year after year. And intensity 
can breed controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's Miss California pageant, the winner was Miss San Fernando 
Valley. But there is no Miss San Fernando Valley contest. The state winner, 
Christina Faust of Woodland Hills, simply lined up a sponsor and entered -- 
which is within the rules. Some contestants who had participated in community 
contests said her participation was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Said one valley Chamber of Commerce manager: "It's just not right. But what are 
you going to do? It's all about money, and if you've got it, you can compete 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
At-large contestants enter beauty pageants all the time, said Richard Guy, 
co-owner of Guyrex, a company that runs the Miss California pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"And often, they win," Guy said. "That's because they usually have the 
dedication to do it all themselves, which makes for better businesswomen. It 
would be unfair to not allow a girl to compete just because there wasn't a 
pageant in her town, or that she didn't win it." 
</P>
<P>
In the Miss Northridge pageant, a handful of women claimed the contest was 
rigged in favor of Dalmatin. 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin and chamber officials denied the accusation. "Anytime you have 
something like this somebody says it was fixed," said Sandra Dack, executive 
director of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce. "But these judges were 
television personalities. They didn't know any of the girls or anybody on the 
chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin also denied those accusations, acknowledging that the bank "does 
choose its contestants" very carefully. Last year, Premier Bank, which has now 
sponsored the last three pageant winners, interviewed Stern three times. "I 
thought I was going for president of the bank," she said.

Last year, Dalmatin was a judge at the Miss Northridge contest. As a previous 
contestant in Miss Teen California, she was regarded as something of an expert 
-- last week's competition was, in fact, her ninth since she was 11. Premier 
Bank gave her a tape of last year's event, which she carefully monitored to see 
how the women walked and how they delivered their speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dalmatin of Northridge moves on to assume her duties. "I want to be a role 
model," she said. "I want to be a woman who has a say in what's going on in 
this world." 
</P>
<P>
Dalmatin won a $500 scholarship to a modeling school, a one night's stay in a 
fantasy suite of her choice, a picture frame, a gift certificate from 
Bullock's, and a $600 registration fee for the Miss California Pageant, which 
she plans on entering in Palm Springs in August. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to take another traditional walk.

GUIDE FOR NOT-SO-SMART GARDENERS FOCUSES ON CONSERVATION, EFFICIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RYAN, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your neighbors may be trying to outdo you with the perfect lawn, but landscape 
architect Lynn Capouya suggests that you can have the last laugh with 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Capouya, transplanted to Southern California from Alabama, has developed 
"Garden Guides," a set of plant care and garden tips printed on a dozen 
plastic-coated cards that can be hung in the garage or tool shed for easy 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
The instructions, formulated for the Southland's dry climate and soil, are 
geared to the layman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For the Unknowing 
</P>
<P>
"This is designed for someone who knows absolutely nothing, who really doesn't 
want to know very much, who wants to be able to look at a chart and go out in 
the yard and do something. It's basically to generate ideas," said Capouya, 32, 
who earned her degree in landscape architecture at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Capouya said with California in its third consecutive year of drought, 
gardeners, landscapers and developers need to be aware of the water-saving 
alternatives to traditional gardening methods. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from the East Coast came out here and they wanted to bring their 
mulberry trees and Bermuda grass with them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of plants that grow and do very well that are native or 
have become indigenous that don't require the water that a lot of the tropical 
and subtropical species do," she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look to the Past 
</P>
<P>
One of Capouya's goals is to bring back low-water plants that may have been 
popular in the past, but have fallen from favor. 
</P>
<P>
"Plant materials are kind of like clothes; they go in and out of fashion," she 
said. "If we don't order it, nurseries don't grow it. What has happened is 
we've stretched to incorporate other materials into our plant palate. We've 
lost a lot of our own native plant materials." 
</P>
<P>
One of her favorites is nandina, or "heavenly bamboo," which was common in the 
1960s but later lost favor. It has a nice color range -- yellow and red -- 
provides an oriental effect, and doesn't need much water. 
</P>
<P>
Capouya, whose firm does landscaping for the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power, the U.S. Postal Service, Sizzler restaurants on the West Coast, and 
numerous hotel and shopping center developers, said the idea for "Garden 
Guides" germinated with client demands for a maintenance manual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Professional Look 
</P>
<P>
"We would scurry around and copy this and that and put parts together, but it 
never looked professional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Garden Guides" originated as something to be passed out to our clients. The 
final product was really much nicer than I intended to make it and the response 
has been great." 
</P>
<P>
It provides charts on when to plant, water, fertilize and spray nine categories 
of low-water, low-maintenance plants. It also diagrams how to plant, stake and 
space plants. 
</P>
<P>
Capouya said she is putting together a "xeriscape," or low-water landscape 
exhibit, with the Metropolitan Water District that will appear at Southern 
California shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
She insists that low-water, money-saving alternatives can be found for most 
thirsty plants. Instead of birch or willow trees, try bottlebrush or paperbark, 
she suggests. Instead of using grass for the whole yard, use it as an accent 
and landscape the rest with drought-tolerant ground cover such as flowering 
gazania or raked earth, sand or rock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Need to Mow 
</P>
<P>
"You can still have a pretty yard but you don't have to use excessive water," 
she said, pointing out the added benefit that "it doesn't require mowing." 
</P>
<P>
If you must have a lawn, Capouya says that grass strains such as marathon 
fescue or Kentucky bluegrass have a deeper root system and thus use less water 
and are heartier than such varieties as Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
Other semi-arid favorites include conifers, bougainvillea, cassia, acacia, 
hopseed bush, California pepper trees and jacaranda, a lavender flowering tree 
native to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
She said water consumption -- and water bills -- can be cut 30% to 50% with the 
right plants and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Occasional deep soaking of trees and shrubs, which causes the roots to grow 
deeper, is preferable to frequent sprinkling. And, of course, watering in the 
early morning or at night reduces water lost through evaporation or plant 
transpiration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triangular Formation 
</P>
<P>
Planting ground cover in a triangular rather than square formation requires 
fewer plants to cover the same area and thus less water. 
</P>
<P>
Another of her pet peeves is people who plant plants that are not compatible 
together -- such as grass and palm trees. The former requires a lot of water 
and the latter very little. 
</P>
<P>
Capouya also recommends planting young plants rather than full-grown ones 
because their roots will more easily adapt to soil and water conditions and in 
the long run provide a healthier garden. 
</P>
<P>
"In planting a garden what you want to focus on is variety to create a visual 
interest, and that has to do with combining color, texture, foliage and flower 
which can all be achieved with drought tolerant plants."

AS LANGSTON WATCHES, ANGELS ROUT MARINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And on Saturday, Mark Langston rested, which meant the Angels had a chance. 
Take Seattle's overpowering left-handed pitcher off the mound and the Mariners 
are, well, the Mariners, in last place in the American League West for a 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
Take the seventh inning of the Angels' 9-2 victory before 29,819 fans Saturday 
night at the Kingdome. Pick up the action with Angel rookie Kent Anderson on 
second base, Brian Downing on first and Mark McLemore set to lay down a 
sacrifice bunt. 
</P>
<P>
With Langston only a spectator, McLemore's bunt was fielded by Seattle reliever 
Jerry Reed, who threw to third base in time to beat Anderson, but not in time 
for Seattle third baseman Edgar Martinez, who missed the throw. 
</P>
<P>
The ball wound up down the third-base line, Anderson scored, Downing took third 
and McLemore wound up at second. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a passed ball by Mariner catcher Dave Valle allowed Downing to score and 
McLemore to advance to third. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, with Dennis Powell pitching, Wally Joyner walked. Lance Parrish 
hit a pop foul that Seattle first baseman Jim Presley snared with a sliding 
catch. Powell, however, was slow to cover first base, so Joyner took off for 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Presley's hurried throw skipped wildly away, enabling McLemore to score. 
</P>
<P>
In a few not-so-easy steps, that is how the Mariners can turn a 2-2 
seventh-inning tie into a 5-2 deficit, soon to be a 9-2 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Angels improved their record against the Langston-less 
Mariners to 3-0. Against Langston, they are 0-2, including an earlier six-hit 
shutout and Friday night's 9-5 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody takes any of their other pitchers lightly," Angel 
Manager Doug Rader said. "Granted, if you can play a series with Seattle and 
miss Langston, you're catching a hell of a break. But you've still got to 
scrape something together against their other guys." 
</P>
<P>
Scraping, however, can be made easier when: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mariner starting pitcher Scott Bankhead (0-2) surrenders three hits and a 
walk in the first inning and a home run to Devon White in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Powell surrenders an eighth-inning home run to slump-ridden Jack Howell, 
who took a .118 average into the game and went hitless in his first three 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julio Solano, Seattle's third relief pitcher, serves up a three-run home 
run to Chili Davis in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Angels amassed 12 hits in support of starting pitcher Chuck Finley 
(2-1), who pitched his first complete game of the season despite yielding nine 
hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some good things happened tonight," Rader observed. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, there was the first inning, which found the Angels off and running 
-- not always a good thing, considering how the Angels can run the bases. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and one out in the first, Parrish sent a line drive 
single up the middle, which scored McLemore from third and should have scored 
White from second. 
</P>
<P>
But White attempted to score standing up and, worse, slowed to a jog as he 
approached the plate. A strong throw from Seattle center fielder Henry Cotto 
and catcher Valle's left leg cut down White. 
</P>
<P>
Blocking home plate with that leg, Valle sent White for a spill, with White 
tumbling over -- but never touching -- the plate. Valle chased down White to 
make the tag and erase one Angel run. 
</P>
<P>
Another Angel met a similar fate one batter later when Joyner tried to score 
from second on Claudell Washington's single to right. Joyner had the presence 
of mind to slide, but he lacks the quickness of feet to outrun right fielder 
Mickey Brantley's throw home. 
</P>
<P>
Another out, inning over and the Angels had managed to parlay three hits and a 
walk into a solitary run. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a whole lot of things went right in the first inning," Rader said. "It was 
more like we persevered through it." 
</P>
<P>
Rader was asked about White's non-slide, which made it all possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's appropriate to dwell it with all the good things that 
happened," he said. "He's going to get blocked off the plate no matter what. If 
I was Devo, I wouldn't want to run into that big guy, either." 
</P>
<P>
White would make amends two innings later by homering into the left-field seats 
against Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
This time, White scored standing up. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't block him on that one," Rader deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
Still, those lost runs of the first inning loomed large when Seattle rallied to 
tie, 2-2, in the bottom of the third. Jim Presley and Edgar Martinez hit 
successive singles off Finley, advanced on Rey Quinones' sacrifice bunt and 
both came home on Harold Reynolds' single to center. 
</P>
<P>
Finley didn't let another Mariner run cross the plate and recorded a rare 
complete game. Last year, in 31 starts, Finley had two complete games. 
</P>
<P>
Rader kept Finley on the mound until the Mariners broke down. It can happen at 
any time, but this time, it happened in the seventh inning, when everything but 
the Kingdome roof collapsed on Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to success is not allowing that type of thing to happen to you," Rader 
said. "They had two innings like that tonight. They lucked out in the first, 
but if you keep going to the well, it's going to get you sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
For the Angels, the seventh inning was soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are running short on shortstops, which is why Kent Anderson made his 
major-league debut Saturday night. He got his chance when Glenn Hoffman, 
filling in for injured Dick Schofield, took a Mark Langston fastball on his 
left forearm Friday. Hoffman had the arm X-rayed and no break was detected, but 
a deep bruise relegated him to reserve status for Saturday's game. . . . 
Anderson, 25, was the forgotten man in the Angels' training camp, his playing 
time squeezed by the extensive trial given ex-Cincinnati Red shortstop Dave 
Concepcion. Anderson received just 12 at-bats all spring, but hit safely five 
times, finishing with a .417 average. "I didn't have a lot of at-bats, but I 
had a pretty good spring," Anderson said. "They were playing Davey a good bit, 
but they had to see what he could do. They also had Hoffman in camp and 
Schofield's got to get his work in, too. I was fortunate to hit as many times 
as I did." When the Concepcion experiment failed, Anderson was sent to Edmonton 
but, in effect, moved up the depth chart. "I thought I'd get the call (to the 
majors) some time this year," Anderson said. "I didn't realize it would be this 
early." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray took ground balls at second base for the first time since being 
placed on the disabled list last week with a sprained left wrist. "He's not to 
the point where he can swing a bat," trainer Ned Bergert said, "but he's begun 
some forearm resistance work. He's eligible to come off (the disabled list) on 
the 21st, and he could be ready by then." . . . Chili Davis, playing with a 
sore right shoulder, has discontinued treatment on the shoulder, hoping that a 
light weight program will be enough to strengthen the joint. Davis has yet to 
record an outfield assist with his weakened shoulder, but Saturday he showed 
signs of coming around with the bat, going 2 for 5 with a three-run home run.

PETE ROSE JR. HAS SHOWN HALL OF FAME POISE, IF NOT TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FREDERICK, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's only played two professional games, but already Pete Rose Jr. has received 
more media attention than most minor leaguers get in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
And if this kid can play as well as he has reacted to outside pressures over 
which he has virtually no control, then he's going to be around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
With a calm that belies his youth while at the same time betrays the mental 
toughness of his background, young Rose is trying to leave his own imprint on a 
game that has been indelibly stamped by his famous dad. At a level where most 
players strive for an identity, Pete Jr. can't escape the national glare. 
</P>
<P>
It's as inevitable as it is unavoidable. He is Pete Rose's son and, especially 
in these turbulent times, the name means media magic. 
</P>
<P>
So, as he tries to establish himself in the Baltimore Orioles' minor league 
system as a third baseman for the Class-A Frederick Keys, it seems as though 
every move is chronicled. He has already heard all of the obvious questions -- 
and dealt with them all, except for those pertaining to baseball's ongoing 
investigation of his father, baseball's all-time hit leader and the manager of 
the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to discuss it; I won't discuss it at all," the 19-year old 
politely told inquisitors before the Frederick Keys beat the Kinston (N.C.) 
Indians, 3-1, in their home opener recently. 
</P>
<P>
He's two games into his career (Rose didn't play in the second game of Sunday's 
doubleheader loss in Durham), and still looking for his first hit, but young 
Pete already has a couple of distinctions his dad can't match. 
</P>
<P>
In his first professional start he was involved in a perfect game -- on the 
losing side -- which may be a first in baseball history. And in his team's home 
opener, he participated in the first professional game ever played in his 
team's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Those are mere sidelights, however, for trivia buffs down the road. 
</P>
<P>
What everybody wants to know is this: What is it like to try to follow in the 
footsteps of a father who holds the all-time hit record? How much did he help? 
Is your game patterned after his? 
</P>
<P>
One thing you don't have to ask him is whether or not he ever thought about 
avoiding the obvious comparisons. "I was born to be a ballplayer," he said, 
alluding to the exposure to the game he's had over the years. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice if Pete Jr. could run out from under his father's shadow, but 
he knows it isn't possible. He has accepted that as he goes on with his career. 
</P>
<P>
"When dad was around, sure he helped me," Rose said. "But he really wasn't able 
to watch me that much. I probably learned the most from my mom, because she 
knows the game." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his father, who is a switch-hitter, Pete Jr. hits only from the left 
side. His batting stance does bear a strong resemblance to his father's, but 
beyond that the similarities aren't that noticeable. There isn't the mad dash 
on and off the field, although the intensity level appears comparable. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose Jr. doesn't want to be a carbon copy, not that he thinks there would 
be anything wrong with that, but because it would only shield his own identity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do it my way," he said, explaining his desire to establish his own 
individuality. "I just want to be me -- and he (Pete Sr.) wants me to be me. He 
hasn't asked me to go out and do it his way." 
</P>
<P>
"His way," however, is probably destined to be the yardstick by which Pete Jr. 
is always measured. It might not be fair, but the youngster can live with it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he faces a barrage of questions at every stop. One hour and 45 
minutes before his team's home opener, immediately afer batting practice, he 
was doing television interviews and answering questions from reporters while 
preparing for infield practice. As the season progresses, the demands will 
decrease, but for now he's the No. 1 topic in every city. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it in the minor leagues," said Jerry Narron, the 
Keys' rookie manager. "In the big leagues maybe, but in the minor leagues 
there's nothing even close." 
</P>
<P>
What has impressed the Orioles throughout this trying spring has been the 
manner in which Rose has handled the crush since Pete Sr. became a daily 
headline. "The only thing I told him was that I would screen the requests and 
pass them all on to him," said Doug Melvin, the Orioles' director of player 
personnel. "I told him that he's mature enough to handle the situation however 
he wants."

THE PUCK STOPS HERE FOR OILERS; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS SCORE 6-3 VICTORY TO FINISH OFF COMEBACK, DEFENDING CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Without Wayne Gretzky, the Edmonton Oilers will not be the Stanley Cup 
champions. Not this year, anyway. Gretzky and his new mates, the once 
futureless Kings, eliminated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions with 
a 6-3 victory in the seventh game of their best-of-seven National Hockey League 
playoff series Saturday night before a raucous capacity crowd at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
It's a new era of Kings hockey with the Great Gretzky, who scored the first 
goal and the last goal as the Kings completed their comeback from a 
three-games-to-one deficit against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who set a club record for points in a playoff series, with 12, and 
tied a club record for assists in a playoff season, with nine,has brought the 
Kings to life. And he has brought hockey to life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But to do that, he had to defeat, with some regret, the players with whom he 
has shared four Stanley Cup titles. He also had to defeat, with some degree of 
glee, the owner who traded him to the Kings last Aug. 9, Peter Pocklington. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was last in line as the teams skated past each other, formally shaking 
hands. He shook hands with most of his old teammates, hugged a few, then gave 
his new fans a No. 1 sign as he skated off. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly had a lot of mixed emotions," Gretzky said. "I don't think it 
affected me on the ice, but it bothered me off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for the people of Los Angeles, for the players here, for the 
coaches, and I'm especially happy for (King owner Bruce) McNall. . . . But I 
know that no one takes losing harder than (Mark) Messier and (Kevin) Lowe. 
Those guys are champions. I enjoyed playing with them. . . . I feel deeply 
sorry for what they're feeling now. 
</P>
<P>
"Going through the line was difficult. I wanted to talk with them, but I also 
wanted to let them alone. . . . Personally, I didn't enjoy the series at all. 
It wasn't fun for me. For 15 days or whatever, I saw those guys every day, and 
no words were spoken. That's not what life should be about. You're supposed to 
be able to talk to your best friends." 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of new friends packing the Kings' dressing room after their 
impressive comeback. McNall was about as happy as a man can be on his 39th 
birthday. "I felt like a father giving birth to a new franchise tonight," he 
said. "I kept flashing back from Aug. 9 up to today. I was ready to cry, 
really. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
After an epidemic of flu helped saddle the Kings with a 3-1 deficit, they came 
back to win Game 5 at the Forum, Game 6 at Edmonton and Game 7 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
That's what home-ice advantage is all about. The Kings became only the sixth 
team in the history of the National Hockey League to come back after trailing, 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will open their Smythe Division final series Tuesday night against 
the Flames at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 16,005 and then some roared when the Kings skated out. The fans 
stayed on their feet while the team skated through warmups, quieted for the two 
national anthems and resumed the original roar through the final strains of the 
Star-Spangled Banner and the opening faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
Folks barely had a chance to settle back into their seats before Gretzky scored 
on the first shot of the game, bringing them back to their feet for a frenzied 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
It was a moment reminiscent of Gretzky's first game as a King, when a capacity 
crowd cheered him onto the ice and then went wild when he scored on his first 
shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky was not a one-man show Saturday night. Bernie Nicholls had two 
goals, and goalie Kelly Hrudey, acquired late in the season from the New York 
Islanders to give the Kings a veteran in the nets for a game such as this, 
stopped 31 shots and earned a number of standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
As he held off the Oilers, preserving the Kings' tenuous one-goal lead through 
most of the third period, and then continued to stop them when they attacked 
with a two-man advantage (after pulling Grant Fuhr out of goal) in the final 
minutes, the fans chanted "Hru-dey, Hru-dey, Hru-dey" on every save. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's goal, 52 seconds into the game, came on a two-on-one break, with 
Gretzky slapping a shot at the left corner of the Oiler net. Fuhr was kneeling 
there, ready for the shot, and he thought he had stopped it when the red light 
went on and the crowd erupted. Fuhr glanced over his shoulder to see the puck 
trickling in. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' lead was short-lived. Jari Kurri evened the score at 4:48, putting 
in his own rebound of a shot he took off a three-on-one break. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kontos got credit for the Kings' go-ahead goal in the first period when 
Nicholls' slap shot from the left circle went high and was about to fly past 
the Oiler net when it hit Kontos, standing near the right post, and dropped in 
behind Fuhr at 11:56. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos' goal came on a power play, the result of a holding call on Normand 
Lacombe. 
</P>
<P>
A holding call on Kontos with just 26 seconds to play in the first period gave 
the Oilers a power play at the start of the second period, and the Oilers took 
advantage, tying the game again just 34 seconds into the second period when 
Kurri centered a pass from behind the net to Craig Simpson, who fired the shot 
past Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
Again the Kings went ahead by a goal, taking a 3-2 lead at 6:51 when Dave 
Taylor battled for the puck along the right side boards, took the puck into the 
right corner and then sent it across the ice to Nicholls, who took the scoring 
shot from the left faceoff circle. 
</P>
<P>
But again the Oilers tied it up, making it 3-3 at 7:48 when defenseman Lowe 
followed up on his own shot and put the puck over Hrudey, who had been knocked 
over by Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
A shot by John Tonelli on a power play late in the second period hit high in 
the back of the Oiler net and popped back out before goal judge Ted Metcalfe 
saw it. Television replays from different angles showed that the puck had been 
in, and both Gretzky and Nicholls pleaded, but since none of the on-ice 
officials had seen it, the goal did not count. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds after Tonelli's shot, Craig Muni was called for holding, giving the 
Kings a two-man advantage for the 53 seconds that were left on an interference 
call on Jeff Beukeboom. 
</P>
<P>
Skating five against three, Nicholls put the Kings ahead, 4-3, with his second 
goal of the period at 16:23. Gretzky sent him the pass from the left-side 
boards and Nicholls went right in on Fuhr, tripping over the kneeling goalie 
and then pushing the puck backward, behind Fuhr and into the left corner, while 
falling head first to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
A clinching goal, making it 5-3 at 14:50 of the third period, was scored on a 
45-foot slap shot by Dale DeGray, a King who had not scored a goal since Dec. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' sixth score, a short-handed goal on the net abandoned by Fuhr, was 
not extra insurance. It was simply the finishing touch, just one more reason 
for the fans to stand and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls said: "This was my first-ever seventh game, so obviously, it was the 
most exciting game of my career. These are the loudest fans of any building in 
the NHL. Once you step out on the ice, you get goose bumps. All year, they've 
shown support and, hopefully, now L.A. will be a hockey town." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the best-of-seven Smythe Division final series between the Kings 
and the Calgary Flames will go on sale to the public today at 9 a.m., following 
sale by priority numbers at 8, at the Forum box office and all TicketMaster 
outlets. The series opens in Calgary, and the first games at the Forum will be 
Saturday, April 22, and Monday, April 24. Because of conflicts in the building, 
the rest of the series will be announced Sunday after a conference call with 
the NHL. Tickets will be $31, $22 and $16. . . . A shot by Bernie Nicholls that 
bounced off Chris Kontos and into the Oiler net in the first period gave Kontos 
a National Hockey League record for power-play goals in a playoff series (six) 
and added to his club record for most goals in a series (eight). . . . Wayne 
Gretzky's goal at 52 seconds of the first period gave him 11 points in this 
series, breaking the club's playoff record of 10 that was shared by Mike Murphy 
(1977 vs. Boston) and Daryl Evans (1982 vs. Edmonton). Gretzky's assist on 
Nicholls' second-period goal gave him nine assists in the series, tying the 
club record for assists in a playoff season.

SLEW CITY SLEW IS FIRST IN OAKLAWN HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Slew City Slew survived late runs by Stalwars and Homebuilder and a foul claim 
to win the $400,000 Oaklawn Handicap at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Wayne Lukas and ridden by Angel Cordero, Slew City Slew took the 
lead early and covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:49. 
</P>
<P>
Sent off as the 7-5 favorite, the son of Seattle Slew finished a half-length 
ahead of Stalwars, with Antonio Castanon aboard, while Homebuilder, with Larry 
Snyder up, finished a nose back in third. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bailey, who rode Proper Reality, filed a foul claim against Homebuilder 
for a bump into the first turn, and Snyder, on Homebuilder, claimed foul 
against Slew City Slew for a bump heading into the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards determined that the second bump was actually caused by Santa Anita 
Handicap winner Martial Law and let the results stand. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law finished sixth in the field of eight. 
</P>
<P>
Faultless Ensign rebounded from a 20-length loss in his last race and held off 
four other horses in the stretch to win the $150,000 Garden State Stakes in the 
mud at Garden State Park in Cherry Hill, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Ben Perkins Jr., Faultless Ensign, with Chris DeCarlo in the saddle, 
covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:51 1/5 and earned $90,000 for his owners, the 
Anthony Tornetta Racing Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Forlitano, who was shipped in from California for the race, outfinished favored 
El Senor to win the $100,000 Bougainville Handicap on the grass at Hialeah, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Corey Black, the Argentine-bred 8-year-old won by 1 3/4 lengths, with 
El Senor finishing second, a neck in front of Arlene's Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
The victory in 1:53 4/5 was Forlitano's eighth in 30 grass races. The $60,000 
winner's share of the purse increased his earnings to $769,570 for Evergreen 
Farm. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Pok Ta Pok, with Richard Migliore aboard, scored a nose victory 
over Teddy Drone in the $112,600 Bold Ruler Stakes at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Claim, the favorite, finished third in the six-furlong race for 3-year-olds and 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Pok Ta Pok was clocked on a muddy track in 1:09 4/5 and earned $67,560 for 
owner Barbara W. Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Little Bold John led all the way and held off a late rally by Templar Hill to 
win the 35th running of the $150,000 John B. Campbell Handicap at Pimlico Race 
Track in Pimlico, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The 126-pound topweight in the field of seven covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 2/5 
over a sloppy track to earn a berth in the $700,000 Pimlico Special on May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Little Bold John earned $90,000 for owner John E. Owens of Harwood, Md.

WESTERN PLAYBOY EARNS TRIP TO THE DERBY

<P>
A quarter of a mile from home in Saturday's Blue Grass Stakes, jockey Randy 
Romero was telling himself that this would be the easiest $250,000 race he ever 
won. 
</P>
<P>
Then it became the hardest. Just when Western Playboy and Romero were about to 
ramble past Dispersal at the top of the stretch, the leader in the Keeneland 
race swerved from his position on the rail. 
</P>
<P>
If Western Playboy hadn't been in the way, trying to pass, Dispersal might have 
gone all the way to the outside fence and on into the grandstand. Instead, the 
undefeated Louisiana Derby winner bumped Western Playboy hard, knocking 
Romero's colt sideways. A couple of strides later, Dispersal came over and 
bumped Western Playboy again, though not as hard this time. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Western Playboy, who had been running in a straight line in the 
middle of the track before the first bump, shook off these intrusions and went 
on to a half-length victory before 26,330 fans on a raw, overcast day. The 
victory over five other 3-year-olds will send Western Playboy, Romero and 
trainer Harvey Vanier to the Kentucky Derby on May 6 at Churchill Downs, where 
the Illinois-bred will be the third betting choice, behind Easy Goer, the 
odds-on favorite, and Sunday Silence, the Santa Anita Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
They've played this bump and grind before in the Blue Grass, the next-to-last 
major Derby prep, with only Easy Goer's Aqueduct appearance in next Saturday's 
Wood Memorial remaining. In 1983, Western Playboy's sire, Play Fellow, was the 
beneficiary when that celebrated rowdy, Marfa, knocked Desert Wine and Copelan 
out of the race. Play Fellow, clear of the trouble, went on to win and give 
Vanier his first Blue Grass victory. 
</P>
<P>
Like Marfa, who had difficulty running straight in several of his races, 
Dispersal has also been a time bomb waiting to explode, even though his career 
before Saturday consisted of only three starts. In the Lousiana Derby, when 
Jose Santos rode him for the first time, Dispersal bore out at the start, 
jostled Santos and was a handful for the veteran jockey all the way around. 
</P>
<P>
"He was green at the Fair Grounds," Santos said before the Blue Grass. "He was 
a little crazy. But after working him in Kentucky, he seems like a different 
horse and has been relaxing a lot more. Now he goes the way I want him to go." 
</P>
<P>
So workouts can be deceiving. Dispersal also carried Tricky Creek, the other 
speed horse in the race, wide on the first turn on Saturday. Trainer Bud Delp, 
who had won the Blue Grass with Spectacular Bid before winning the Kentucky 
Derby and Preakness 10 years ago, said after Saturday's race that he wasn't 
sure what caused Disperal to misbehave -- lack of seasoning or the possibility 
that the colt's shins might be bothering him again. Dispersal didn't race last 
year because of sore shins. 
</P>
<P>
Dispersal finished nine lengths ahead of Tricky Creek, the third-place horse 
who had a neck on his stablemate, Feather Ridge. Trailing the field were 
Arcadia Falls and Revive. 
</P>
<P>
Western Playboy, who won his first stakes race, the Jim Beam, at Turfway Park 
two weeks ago, has four wins and four seconds in nine starts. Favored because 
of the win in the Beam and his fondness for muddy tracks, he paid $4, $2.60 and 
$2.20. Dispersal, the second choice, paid $2.80 and $2.40; Tricky Creek, 
coupled with Feather Ridge in the betting, paid $2.20, and a $2 exacta on the 
first two finishers was worth $10.20. 
</P>
<P>
Western Playboy's time for 1 1/8 miles was a slow 1:51 1/5. The big chestnut 
earned $185,900 for Nancy Vanier -- the trainer's wife and breeder of the horse 
-- and Raymond A. Roncari, a Connecticut construction man who bought a 25% 
interest in the colt earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off the track after the ceremony in the winner's circle, Romero took 
three of the five pairs of goggles that he wore and flung them to fans. 
Romero's No. 1 Kentucky Derby horse was Dixieland Brass, but he went lame as 
the favorite in the Florida Derby, a race in which Western Playboy finished 
second. Then Romero finished second to Western Playboy while riding Feather 
Ridge in the Jim Beam. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my eye on this horse (Western Playboy) for a long time," Romero said. 
"I went to Mr. Vanier the day after the Jim Beam and asked him if I could ride 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Western Playboy in the Beam, had a commitment dating back to 
last year to ride Easy Goer as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just loping by the leader today when the bumping started," Romero said 
of the Blue Grass. "My horse is so big that he overcame all that. It slowed our 
momentum, but he still finished beautiful. He belongs in the Kentucky Derby. A 
mile and a quarter should be his best distance." 
</P>
<P>
Back at the barn, an hour or so after the Blue Grass, Vanier's stable hands 
rejoiced with champagne, some Kentucky whiskey and even a little rum. Western 
Playboy completed several circuits of the shed row and appeared to have 
survived the race with only a couple of minor nicks on his rear legs. One of 
his handlers said that the Jim Beam had been a four-nick race. 
</P>
<P>
Santos could offer only a flimsy explanation for Dispersal's wrong turn at the 
top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw the (starting) gate and started getting out real bad," the jockey said. 
"He worked good the other day, but then he didn't see anything like today. He's 
still learning. He ran straight after he passed the gate. He did the same thing 
when he saw the gate in the Louisiana Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"The other horse (Tricky Creek) stayed close to me all the way down the 
backside, and that took a lot out of my horse. I had some horse left in the 
stretch. He started running again after we bumped." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Grass started in front of the stands, and after the horses left, the 
gate was moved up the stretch parallel to the outside fence and opposite the 
three-sixteenths pole. 
</P>
<P>
Romero won the race after the Blue Grass, giving him four winners for the day 
and 13 victories through the first seven days of the meeting. The 31-year-old 
jockey has also won five of the seven stakes run, and when he went to the barn 
late Saturday to check on the condition of Western Playboy, Romero gave away 
yet another pair of goggles to a fan. The sky's the limit when a jockey's 
riding as he is. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Bud Delp said that he would make a decision today regarding whether 
Dispersal runs in the Kentucky Derby. . . . None of the other Blue Grass horses 
will run in the Derby. . . . In his only other start at Keeneland, Western 
Playboy won the first race of his career, beating maidens here last October. . 
. . There hasn't been an off track at the Derby since 1970, but Western Playboy 
would benefit if it rained this year. He's had three wins and two seconds in 
five off-track starts. . . . Western Playboy's earnings grew to $669,541. . . . 
Randy Romero already has broken, by one, the Keeneland stakes record of four 
wins in a season. The record had been shared by Eddie Arcaro, Kenny Knapp, Don 
Brumfield and Earlie Fires. . . . Easy Goer is scheduled to work five furlongs 
this morning at Belmont Park.

NFL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS ARE IN GOOD POSITION; RAIDERS MUST TRADE FOR IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In no particular order, the National Football League continues its inexorable 
move toward an undergraduate draft, chaos and the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Three prime undergraduates -- halfbacks Barry Sanders, Tim Worley and Sammie 
Smith -- have dealt themselves in for next Sunday's draft simply by filing 
applications, with the unstated promise of going to court and bringing down the 
whole anti-trust house of cards if they're denied. The league, being sued on 
those very grounds by the players' union, has seen the wisdom in granting all 
their wishes, as it did a year ago with Ironhead Heyward. Next year, the line 
could stretch out the door. 
</P>
<P>
Two other undergraduates -- quarterbacks Steve Walsh of Miami and Timm 
Rosenbach of Washington State -- opted for the supplemental draft, instead. 
This will probably make both No. 1 picks, which was no sure thing for Walsh in 
the regular pool. 
</P>
<P>
If that's good news to USC's Rodney Peete, it may not be good enough to get him 
into the first round. Pro scouts praise his head, heart and athletic ability, 
but mark him down on size (6-0 1/2) and arm strength. "He reminds you of the 
guy at Philadelphia," said a scout. "Not the No. 1 guy (Randall Cunningham), 
the No. 3 guy (Don MacPherson)." 
</P>
<P>
An early, optimistic guess for Peete: Green Bay on the second round. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams, this draft adds up to another great opportunity. They'll again 
have two first-round choices and three second-round picks, the last payoff for 
Eric Dickerson. If they do as well as last year (Aaron Cox, Fred Strickland, 
Anthony Newman, Flipper Anderson and the lone first-year disappointment, Gaston 
Green), they could set themselves up for years, a la their Roman 
Gabriel-to-Philadelphia deal. 
</P>
<P>
For the Raiders, it's a great challenge. Having already used high picks to get 
Willie Gault, Jim Lachey (now gone) and Jay Schroeder, they're without a No. 1 
and owe the Washington Redskins either their No. 3, or Nos. 4-5 as well. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the world awaits Al Davis' next move. There is gathering speculation 
he'll offer Tim Brown to the Atlanta Falcons for the fifth selection in the 
draft. The Raiders are thought to be panting after Deion Sanders, supposedly 
the hottest cornerback prospect since Mike Haynes, but Davis couldn't bear to 
part with Brown. Or could he? 
</P>
<P>
The top five players in this draft are considered potential stars. Worley, 
Broderick Thomas and Andre Rison are rated a step behind. 
</P>
<P>
The next seven or eight players are also well thought of. After that, star 
quality falls off, so teams are expected to fall all over each other, trying to 
trade up into the gravy, or down for extra choices. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one early guess of how it shapes up, heading into the stretch run. There 
will be another guess just before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
1 DALLAS Troy Aikman QB UCLA: The Cowboys are weighing their options but in the 
end, Aikman's slow post-season won't mean anything. He's still a 
once-every-three-or-four-years prospect. 
</P>
<P>
2 GREEN BAY Tony Mandarich OT Michigan State: Despite Aikman's presence, this 
is the highest-rated prospect in the draft. He's 6-5, 305, has run a 4.66 40, 
plays hard, shows fine agility and a mean streak a mile wide. Billed as the 
next coming of Anthony Munoz. Says one scout: "An animal." 
</P>
<P>
3 DETROIT Barry Sanders RB Oklahoma State: Despite his power and game-breaking 
ability, this Heisman Trophy winner doesn't quite have the scouts drooling as 
they did over Bo Jackson. At 5-8, 195, he doesn't have that classic 6-2, 225 
physique of Bo and Herschel Walker. Also, the Lions are going to run'n'shoot 
under new offensive coordinator Mouse Davis, which isn't ideal for a workhorse 
back, and they need help all over. They offered this pick to the St. Louis 
Cardinals for their No. 1 picks, but were turned down. However, Lion attendance 
has plunged and they'd have a hard time explaining passing him up. 
</P>
<P>
4 KANSAS CITY Derrick Thomas LB Alabama: Not rated as highly as Deion Sanders, 
but Chiefs have a solid secondary and think they can make a run at the division 
title -- they play the weak fifth-place schedule -- if they can shore up their 
defensive front. Thomas is a 6-2, 227-pound burner who had 27 sacks in his 
career, eclipsing the school record (15) of Cornelius Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
5 ATLANTA Deion Sanders CB Florida State: "Neon Deion" has a big mouth and 
skills to match. Ran a 4.27 at the combine workout, and has been as low as 
4.21, which would be right behind Bo Jackson's 4.18 for fastest football player 
ever. Great cover man. Great baseball prospect who played in the New York 
Yankee farm system last summer and this spring. He and Mandarich are rated the 
top prospects in the draft and it's an upset that Deion goes even this low. 
</P>
<P>
6 TAMPA BAY Tim Worley HB Georgia: Handicapping Ray Perkins is difficult, 
because you have to discount anything coming out of his mouth. Last year, he 
said he'd take Sterling Sharpe, took Paul Gruber. This year he's talking 
Broderick Thomas, so figure Worley, a 6-1, 220-pounder with 4.4 speed, billed 
as a more polished John Stephens. Buccaneers need something to take the heat 
off Vinny Testaverde, unless they want to see another 38 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
7 PITTSBURGH Andre Rison WR Michigan State: A burner who played in a running 
offense, but torched every cornerback who came near him in post-season. 
Steelers like the idea of a tandem with Louis Lipps. 
</P>
<P>
8 SAN DIEGO Broderick Thomas LB Nebraska: The Chargers told the Cowboys to call 
if they were moving Aikman, and might have considered Rosenbach if he were in 
the regular pool, but they're happy to see Broderick is still around. At 6-2, 
254, he ran a 4.57 at the scouting combine and fills the hole left by Chip 
Banks. 
</P>
<P>
9 MIAMI Louis Oliver SS Florida: Dolphins were talking big backs, but didn't 
work out Worley or Sammie Smith. Oliver, 6-2, 225, was first compared to Bennie 
Blades, then David Fulcher and could help the Miami rushing defense in the same 
way the Cincinnati Bengal behemoth does. 
</P>
<P>
10 PHOENIX Sammie Smith HB Florida State: The erratic George Boone is still in 
charge of the draft, so anything is possible. Cardinal coaches are praying that 
Smith will be on the board for them. He's another Worley-like prodigy, a 
220-pounder with 4.35 speed. He's even more of a game-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
11 CHICAGO Burt Grossman DE Pitt: Foiled in their bid for Houston's Ray 
Childress, with Richard Dent and William Perry question marks and Dan Hampton 
and Steve McMichael aging, Bears are delighted that the highest-rated defensive 
lineman slips all the way to them. 
</P>
<P>
12 CHICAGO Donnell Woolford CB Clemson: The only other top corner prospect this 
year. Bears have long had a problem there and this makes it a big defensive 
draft for them. 
</P>
<P>
13 DENVER Cleveland Gary FB Miami: Broncos are desperate to bulk up their toy 
defensive line but were foiled in a bid for Buffalo's Bruce Smith. But Sammy 
Winder is retiring after this season, and Tony Dorsett ought to, and something 
has to finally be done about a running game, too. Gary's a 230-pounder who can 
catch, a Bronco-type. 
</P>
<P>
14 NEW YORK JETS Tracy Rocker DT Auburn: Great name, but bad knees and a poor 
senior season. He's a 275-pounder with the strength and quickness to play the 
nose. Jets need to find successors to Joe Klecko and Mark Gastineau. 
</P>
<P>
15 SEATTLE Eric Metcalf RB Texas: Seahawks need help on their defensive front 
but this elusive 177-pounder will make such a neat foil to Curt Warner and John 
L. Williams. He turned people on in post-season and only his small size pushes 
him down this far. 
</P>
<P>
16 NEW ENGLAND Hart Lee Dykes WR Oklahoma State: An acrobatic 6-3, 220-pounder 
with 4.6 speed, compared to Al Toon.

17 PHOENIX Eric Hill LB LSU: A big- hitting 250-pounder with decent speed. One 
good player on each side of the ball makes this a big draft for Cardinals.

small Giant line.

19 NEW ORLEANS Ralph Norwood OT LSU:20 CLEVELAND Derek Hill WR Arizona: Bernie

<P>
Travis Williams, who couldn't remember when life held more promise, washed down 
his french fries at the local bowling alley diner and continued a shaking 
intestinal war against alcohol detoxification, all the while plotting a 
delicate strategy of weaning spare change from a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have seen me six months ago," he says, reassuring that his 
condition has improved. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Williams would return to a sparse, single-room flat in the collapsing 
heart of this wrought-iron-windowed East Bay community, parts of which even the 
lifelong resident doesn't venture into after dark. Williams defines the 
dimensions of his $175-a-month room as such: 
</P>
<P>
"It's eight by nine by 10," Williams says wryly. "You have eight dollars by the 
ninth or you'll be out by the 10th. That's sort of a joke there." 
</P>
<P>
Shelter used to be the back seat of a 1964 Plymouth at night -- decent enough 
protection, really, until police hooked home to a hitch one day and towed it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Times have been worse for Travis Williams, though it's difficult to imagine 
upon first inspection. Life here has been stripped to bare essentials: "All I 
need is a roof, a bed and a hot plate," insists Williams, who has braved long 
stretches with none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' smile is surprisingly bright, given his plight and the gape of 
missing teeth from both upper and lower plates. His 42-year-old body is 
street-worn but firm, and only a gray-flecked beard and slight mid-section 
paunch suggest glory days have long passed. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' longest journey, from gutter to feet, began with a wobbly first step. 
But he is bathing and shaving regularly these days, no small triumphs. Putting 
down the bottle has been a more complicated and painful struggle, though he is 
trying, even as Williams slips away into another room during an interview to 
secretively sip from a cup. 
</P>
<P>
"You can ease down, if you feel like you need easing down," Williams says of 
his problem. "Cold turkey's cold turkey. I guess I'm chicken trying to do it 
that way. So I just do a little at a time until I can get my ticket out of here 
and start working on plan two of this life of mine. It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
Plan one, at the early years, flashed to fame like a rocket, only to reverse 
course toward a human crash-and-burn. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Williams was once fast as the wind, a kickoff-return star for the Green 
Bay Packers and the Rams. On his 22nd birthday in 1968, Williams appeared in 
Green Bay's 33-14 win over Oakland in Super Bowl II at Miami -- Coach Vince 
Lombardi's farewell gift to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie in 1967, Williams set kick-return records that still stand -- most 
touchdowns in a season (four) and highest average return for one season (41.06 
yards). He won the National Football League's return title twice, in 1967 and 
1971. Both trophies, which resemble Oscar statuettes, are collecting dust in a 
cluttered corner of memorabilia at his mother's house. Though he played only 
five seasons, Williams still owns or shares seven NFL records and can recite 
each in detail on request. 
</P>
<P>
But the one-time world-class sprinter who raced so fast at Arizona State that 
he earned the nickname Roadrunner, somehow ended up on the wrong side of the 
track. There he would know a more dubious moniker: Streetwalker. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have thought I'd be 60 years old and still running tailback," Williams 
says. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Williams' career ended at age 26 with the Rams in 1972 after his left 
knee buckled in an exhibition game. Williams didn't leave the NFL quietly, 
raging into the night that he was denied a fair chance to prove the surgeons 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"You start running 9.7 and you're gone," says Williams, once timed at 9.3 
seconds in the 100-yard dash. "It's like, 'We've done used him up. Time for him 
to go do something else. Thanks for the championship, thanks for the Super 
Bowl, but right now we got a first-round choice coming up and you're in the 
way. Thanks for using your body for five years. You all come back now, ya 
hear?' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams made $35,000 with the Rams in 1971, his last full season, and left the 
game ill-trained for any profession that couldn't squeeze his once-precious 
commodity of speed. He left also with a wife, Arie, seven children, a mortgage 
and a bleak future. Williams bounced from job to job -- hauling garbage in his 
truck at one point -- but when the money finally ran out in 1976, Williams lost 
his three-bedroom Richmond home to foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
"I told everyone I sold it," Williams says now. "But I lost it." 
</P>
<P>
And down came the world. By 1979, Williams and his wife were in jail; Travis 
for breaking a man's jaw in two places during a fight, Arie for a manslaughter 
driving conviction. Both were drinking heavily at the time, often hiding the 
bottle from each other. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s dealt a series of staggering blows to Williams, who roamed the 
streets for months at a time after house-clearing arguments with Arie. The 
jobs, as usual, came and went. Mostly went. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Williams sank deeper and deeper, hitting bottom in 1985 when, in a span 
of one year beginning April 9, he lost Arie to a drug overdose, his mother, 
Cleaster, to colon cancer, and sister Dolores and best friend Harold Ervin to 
deaths accelerated by alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
The children were divided in the aftermath and left to relatives. Williams 
dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just out there," he says of life on the streets of Richmond. "I thought 
'It's time to make it on your own, Travis,' but, Jesus Christ, it's rough. It 
still is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like this: Ever since I was 18, everything was prearranged for me. I went 
to college on a scholarship, so I didn't have to do anything. If you go to a 
basketball game, they're going to feed you. They make sure you're going to get 
back home, all tucked in safe and sound. They're going to have your transcript 
all set for you. All you had to do was play ball and stay healthy. Then in the 
pros, everything was three times better." 
</P>
<P>
Williams remembers roaming the streets at night, looking for shelter. In a 
pinch, he could stay with relatives, or at his mother's home. Others weren't so 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean some of these people are going from house to house, saying, 'Can I 
stretch out for the night,' " he says, "and can my baby stay too?"' 
</P>
<P>
Williams doesn't know what power or spirit resurrected him from the bench at 
Richmond's Fifth-Street Park last August, where he was sharing a bottle of 
cheap wine with a friend on an otherwise ordinary, bleary-eyed day. He 
remembers scanning the park and remarking how many more residents it was 
housing these days, men and women like himself who curled up in cars at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I had dragged myself down for so long in self-pity," he recalls. "You know, 
through all the deaths. I just got to looking around me and said 'Ain't this a 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Next day he found his way to the local soup kitchen and re-introduced himself 
to Susan Prather, a feisty, free-lancing advocate for the homeless regularly 
found head-deep in the ghetto mess, often dropping off food and clothes to the 
needy. She and Williams had often seen each other in the streets, though 
Prather had no idea he was a former Packer; or what a Packer was, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"He had had a hard few years," Prather remembers. "But what struck me was that 
he was a nice man. He still had those qualities. I was surprised the street 
hadn't beat that out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Williams claims Prather, who is white, could walk the dangerous streets of 
Richmond at night in furs and jewels. On two occasions when her car was robbed, 
the merchandise was returned after the crooks discovered it was Prather's. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody would touch her," Williams says, "because she's helped so many." 
</P>
<P>
Williams joined her list, and was shocked himself to awaken clean-shaven one 
morning last October in Washington D.C., a picket-sign in hand and purpose in 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Williams joined Prather and two others in a rally at California Senator Alan 
Cranston's office to protest $35 billion in federal housing cuts since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
When the group refused to leave Cranston's office, the members were arrested, 
handcuffed and escorted to jail. Williams had been incarcerated before, but for 
all the wrong reasons. Never had prison felt so right. 
</P>
<P>
Williams pleaded guilty to unlawful entry and expected the worst, but Judge 
George H. Goodrich, making special note of their cause, sentenced the four to 
time already served and relieved them of court costs. 
</P>
<P>
More invigorated by the experience, Williams returned to Richmond in rarefied 
air, a bona fide political advocate; albeit an impoverished one. But when he 
took to the pulpit at rallies to hail his cause, he spoke with the conviction 
of experience, often on an empty stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought the press," Prather says. "Travis offered his name and his body and 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
Reciting the homeless story was more than fist-pounding rhetoric from your 
average retired football player. In many ways, it was Williams' own story. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," he says. "If you don't have a house, how are you going to have 
the energy to go look for work -- if you have to worry about the rain tonight? 
</P>
<P>
"So what do you do? You go to the bottle, beat up the wife, and now you got a 
broken family. The wife goes to the street, probably sells her body, she's 
probably already started on crack. And he's full of alcohol all the time, and 
the kids are in a shelter. That makes them homeless. If you've got a good warm 
bath, a bed, and something to eat, at least you can think. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ain't got a roof over you, brother, and you've been up all night, up in 
the alley, you think I'm going to find a job? I'm going to find some more 
covers to put over me tonight. That's what makes homeless to me. And I've seen 
it time and time again. And I've thought about it, and thought about it, and 
said: 'How did this happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
As he finished, Williams stabbed at his steak and prawns with the hunger of one 
who rarely ate so well. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Prather, Williams is working again -- barely -- as floor manager of 
Richmond's Souper Center, a relief kitchen operated by donations from 
Volunteers of America. The pay is adequate, $7 per hour, but the hours aren't. 
Williams works only two hours a day, six days a week -- some weeks less. Rent 
absorbs most of his wages, leaving little to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Williams smiles when asked how he manages on such a salary. The smile suggests 
he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest I have to hustle on my own," he says uneasily, not willing to share 
the secrets of a panhandler. "But I can do that with a smile, too." 
</P>
<P>
He says welfare is not an option because the paperwork, long lines and frequent 
appointments necessary to remain qualified for relief is time better spent 
helping the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"And this homeless thing," Williams says, "is probably the only thing I've 
wanted to do in 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Williams can take his NFL pension early at age 45, though at a much-reduced 
rate. According to the NFL Players Assn., Williams can expect to collect about 
$300 per month when he qualifies in three years, compared to $580 per month if 
he waits until 55. 
</P>
<P>
No special case can be made for getting Williams his money sooner, the NFLPA 
says, unless he qualified under the terms of a mental disability, such as 
schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't waiting until 55," Williams says, "not the way we're dropping off 
these days. I've got about 20 years on that field right now." 
</P>
<P>
Still a local hero to many, Williams carries considerable clout in the soup 
kitchen, which serves about 300 lunches each day. Unafraid to roll up his 
sleeves and show off his biceps, Williams' primary job is to keep lines moving 
and customers in line. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them like to sit there from 11:30 to 2:30 and do nothing, taking up 
space while other people are waiting outside to eat," he explains. "Someone's 
gotta say: 'Hey, you've been there a little long, ain't you? We need your seat, 
would you mind moving, sir?' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams is also in charge of handing out food tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a personal interest in this," he says. "I'm a guy who's been through 
this and that. (They wonder), so how the hell did I end up homeless? Then they 
see me coming out of it. That's inspirational. I'm hoping I give that image to 
ones that have given up -- all the way. They can say, 'Hell, here's somebody 
that's had it all and then was down on the ground, and it picked him up. It 
might work for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams' life has new meaning, yes, but meaning hasn't written a rent check 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm smiling, but I'm broke," he says. "Before, I was broke and not smiling. 
There's a difference. . . . Hey, I'm looking for a job. Let me carry your 
luggage for you, your pencils and pens. Take me back to L.A. with you." 
</P>
<P>
Williams wished he never returned to Richmond when his career ended in 1974 
after one last failed tryout with the Jacksonville Sharks of the World Football 
League. And while a hometown may share in your glories, so does it revel in 
your failures, as Williams soon discovered. So it puzzles the man who escaped 
the ghetto that he would return to the scene of its crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still a hero back east," Williams says proudly, recalling four mostly 
memorable seasons in Green Bay. "But out here, with the people I grew up with, 
it's always 'Yeah, he waaaaas good, but look at him now."' 
</P>
<P>
So he tolerates the behind-the-back-snipes from drug dealers and pimps who once 
envied his success. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh sure, I see them grinning," Williams says. "Here in the ghetto, it's always 
good to have a great big Cadillac and give a guy a ride that used to have five 
Cadillacs. That gives them a chance to be on top of somebody that's been there. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to put up with that garbage. It's just human nature. Of course, it's 
always, 'Guess who I got in the car with me,' or 'Guess who's coming over.' It 
put pressure on the kids in school. I was driving some old clunker truck when 
I'm supposed to be in a Rolls Royce." 
</P>
<P>
But Richmond it was and Richmond it remains. His parents bought the house at 
106th Fifth Street in 1953, not long after the family moved west from El 
Dorado, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, Williams rarely stays at the house now, claiming he'd be taking up 
valuable space from the many relatives -- including several children and 
grandchildren -- who bed there now. He prefers his flat less than a block away. 
</P>
<P>
Williams first raised eyebrows and stopwatches with his speed at Richmond's 
Harry Ells High School. There he met Arie, and they married in 1964. The school 
is closed now, though the lot remains vacant while Williams, ever the 
pulpit-pounder, wonders why it can't be converted into a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Williams moved on to Contra Costa Junior College, not far from the county jail 
where he was later housed. One look at Williams in a sprint-race was enough to 
send university recruiters running for his scholarship. Williams considered his 
choices and headed toward Tempe, where he blossomed into a fine young Arizona 
State Wildcat and non-graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was never the second-coming of Gale Sayers as a runner, but he was a 
great kick returner, good enough for round four in the NFL draft. Lombardi 
quickly slotted the rookie into his Packer puzzle, and Williams proved a 
valuable piece on the last Packer title team. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams remembered the Williams of 1967 so well they traded for him three 
years later. In '67, Williams returned a kick 104 yards for a touchdown against 
the Rams in the regular season and burned them twice on scoring runs -- one of 
46 yards -- in a Western Conference title-game win. 
</P>
<P>
After he came to the Rams in 1970, he hobbled through the 1970 season on two 
bad ankles. 
</P>
<P>
During his years with the Packers, he never shared the bond Lombardi developed 
with others during previous years and titles. The rookie remembered doing well 
to stay clear of harm's way, avoiding all contact -- especially eye -- with 
Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
Williams never considered himself rooted in Packer tradition, and perhaps did 
not figure in the axiom of teammate and family being inseparable. After falling 
on hard times in the mid-1970s, Williams sometimes considered Packer loyalty as 
it pertained to him. 
</P>
<P>
The team's leading rusher and most valuable player in 1969, and, two seasons 
before that, a precious pawn on Green Bay's last championship team, Williams 
remains distant and disconnected from his fondest memories. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I really feel bad about is that I had a lot of friends at the 
time," he says. "And I had the sense that they were watching a tree falling in 
the forest and didn't put something to block it up. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd invite you to a party, and it's like, 'Look who I know," and all the 
time you're asking for a job. And they say, 'Well come to the office,' and you 
go to the office Monday and they're gone on a week's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the sense of being used. Now I need some help, and it's, 'Sorry, we're a 
little slow down at the iron company, but I'll keep you posted . . . and close 
the door on the way out.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's not as though he never tested the job market. Williams has worked for 
insurance companies, beer companies, recreation centers, school districts, 
grocery stores, hotels, himself. He's hauled garbage, bounced drunks from bars, 
worked security at liquor stores. He's even relied heavily on the kindness of 
strangers. But he never really recovered after losing the house on 19th Street 
and Pennsylvania, a few blocks from where he lives today. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me the longest time just to go down the street after we moved out," he 
says. "When you look over there and see something that is yours. And you see 
somebody coming out of your door . . . you know." 
</P>
<P>
After foreclosure, the family relocated to a rented house around the corner, 
but the slide continued. Williams, who once owned four cars, started selling 
them off one by one -- sometimes piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's got to sell something to eat," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, a friend showed Williams how to steal gas and electric meters from 
neighborhood houses, then re-attach them to his home. "I hooked them to the 
house so the kids could stay warm," he says. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Williams was allowed to serve his sentence out on weekends. 
It was on a Friday night before regular Saturday morning check-in at Contra 
Costa County Jail when Williams met more trouble. He was at a friend's when a 
fight broke out. "We were drinking a lot of alcohol at the time," Williams 
remembers. "I'll just leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, Williams was thrown in solitary confinement and later sentenced 
to a year's term in the same prison where Arie was serving out a sentence for 
vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in one part, and she's in another," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Finding work in the early 1980s became increasingly difficult as an ex-convict. 
Besides, he and Arie were fighting and drinking too much to take control of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a staggering, bumbling drunk," Williams says. "I just maybe drank too 
much. My wife started drinking more and we started trying to out-drink each 
other, you know, and problems came from that. When you start hiding 
half-bottles from each other, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The choice became obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have slapped her upside the head, it would have been back to jail," 
Williams claims. "So it was better to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"She dumped me, because I was almost the next thing to a bum. I didn't blame 
her. She had enough of it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been on and off the streets since. He says he and Arie were close 
to patching things up in 1985. Her death has been reported as a drug overdose, 
though Williams snaps when hears the description. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they might have provoked the heart attack," he says of the drugs, "so I 
just say heart attack, so nobody will be asking stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
After the deaths of his wife, mother, sister and best friend, Williams "made 
myself lost. That's when I went straight down. You get over one tragedy and 
another one was on top of you. You started looking for who the next one would 
be. The only thing that pulled me out, to tell you the truth, was this homeless 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Williams dreams of some day breaking free of Prather's guiding grip and opening 
his own family shelter. Prather says he can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Travis has changed the streets," he says. "He's brought self respect to the 
streets. How many people get to talk on the nightly news? Or have HBO come down 
to the homeless camps. They come to Richmond to see Travis." 
</P>
<P>
The work has been satisfying, perhaps life-saving. Through the lobbying of 
Williams and many others, the National Guard Armory in Richmond, which once 
stood dormant, is is now housing many of the town's homeless. Williams 
estimates there are 1,000 homeless in Richmond alone. Now that he's tasted 
first blood, he quenches for more. "Until the armory, there were no shelters in 
this county, the second richest county in California," Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' own shelter would be different, specifically designed to keep 
families together during periods of homelessness. He speaks again from 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"If the wife goes this way and the man goes that way, then you've got a broken 
home," he explains. "The child protective service will get your kids. And once 
you break up your family, it's hard getting them back together. Foster homes 
are lousy, and my feeling is, if the family's cracking up, they can come to my 
shelter." 
</P>
<P>
Williams will get to his dream just as soon as can get through his days. Human 
comebacks play out slowly in real life. Prather recently raised donations and 
sent Williams to Roanock, Va., to dry out at a half-way house/retreat run by 
homeless advocate David Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to decide there are more important things than wine," Prather says. 
"Travis is going to make it, even if it kills me. . . . He's says I'm harder on 
him than Lombardi ever was." 
</P>
<P>
The story, obviously, isn't over. Williams is not beyond groveling to satisfy 
his needs. He's says there's more to it than sticking out a hand and looking 
pathetic. You have to case potential donors in a calculated game. "There are 
certain people that you ask, and certain people that you don't ask," Williams 
explains. "Some people, if they got two dollars, they'll give you one. Some 
won't you give nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the rental car after lunch, the driver and Williams wind their way back 
through Richmond toward his flat. Williams is uneasy in the passenger's seat, 
another day's opportunity closing fast. 
</P>
<P>
He finally works up the courage and wonders if the driver might spare a few 
dollars for cigarettes. The driver agrees, with a promise from Williams that 
he'd only spend the money on cigarettes. Williams' mind races as he nervously 
awaits his upcoming trip to Virginia, where hope -- and fear -- spring eternal. 
</P>

"I want to go there with my mind clear," he says, explaining the misery of 
detoxifying, "so I don't have to sweat it out for a week, and all the pain and 
everything will be over with. That's what I like about this, it takes enough of 
your time where you don't even think about taking a little sock, you know what 
I mean? I got to get away from here, and Oakland ain't far enough."

Dominic Olejniczak, former president of the Green Bay Packers Corp. and a 
former Green Bay mayor, died Saturday morning at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Olejniczak's death was stroke-related, a relative said. 
</P>
<P>
Olejniczak, 80, was president of the National Football League for 24 years and 
spent 10 years as the city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
He became president of the Packers on April 28, 1958, when the team was 
struggling. The Packers had not had a winning record in 10 years and had just 
finished their worst season ever with a 1-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
Olejniczak headed the search committee that brought Vince Lombardi to Green Bay 
as coach and general manager, which launched the most successful era in the 
team's history.

AFTER THE RAIN, STEWART MOVES AHEAD BY THREE STROKES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Payne Stewart pulled into a three-stroke lead Saturday before darkness halted 
play in the rain-delayed, incomplete third round of the $800,000 Heritage golf 
tournament at Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who shared the first- and second-round leads with Kenny Perry, moved 
in front when Perry missed the green and bogeyed the ninth hole. When Stewart 
made a birdie and Perry had a bogey on the 11th and final hole they completed, 
the lead went to three shots. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too far to go to be thinking about winning," said Stewart, who was 13 
under par. "I'm just glad to be leading." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Perry, along with 16 others, marked their positions on the course 
and will return this morning to complete the third round. The final round is 
scheduled for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Play was delayed 3 1/2 hours by heavy rains that flooded portions of the course 
and backed up the final starting time to 5:36 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McCumber was third, nine under par, through 11 holes, with Bernhard Langer 
of West Germany at seven under par through 14 holes. Tom Kite and Kenny Knox 
were five under par through 14 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Byrum had a 68 and was the leader in the clubhouse at four-under-par 209. 
Chip Beck and David Ogrin, each with a 68, were at 210. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player of South Africa shot a par 72 and took a one-stroke lead over Gene 
Littler, Don Bies and Bob Erickson in the third round of the $600,000 Tradition 
tournament at Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Player, 53, seeking his 13th career Senior PGA Tour title and first since 
winning five times last year, has an eight-under-par total of 208. He is the 
tour's No. 2 all-time money-winner with $2.92 million. 
</P>
<P>
Littler started the day tied for the lead with Player but shot a 73. 
</P>
<P>
Bies' 68 included seven birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson shot a 70.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
METS PITCH TO GUERRERO AND PAY FOR IT WITH LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Davey Johnson has never been timid when it comes to extolling the 
virtues of his New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
After watching them in a workout in spring training, he told Mike Littwin of 
the Baltimore Sun, "We have so much talent that even if I make a mistake, I'm 
still probably going to be right." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets didn't make that statement look too good Saturday at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and third and one out in the 10th inning of a 2-2 tie 
with the Cardinals, Johnson elected to have Don Aase pitch to Pedro Guerrero, 
instead of walking him to face the left-handed Milt Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, who has always hit right-handers well, has been driving in runs at 
almost every opportunity this season. 
</P>
<P>
The former Dodger slugger made the strategy look bad. He tagged Aase's first 
pitch, a high fastball, for a line drive over left fielder Kevin McReynolds' 
head and Vince Coleman scored from third to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory 
and drop the Mets back into last place in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman opened the inning with an infield single. He stole second, giving him a 
45-for-45 record for steals against the Mets. Ozzie Smith, reactivated just 
before the game, singled to left, Coleman stopping at third. Terry Pendleton 
popped out. 
</P>
<P>
Then came decision time. Johnson didn't hesitate, choosing to pitch to 
Guerrero, who had 13 runs batted in in seven games, instead of Thompson, who is 
batting .462. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson pitched to Guerrero because he was easier to double up. 
</P>
<P>
"If the count had gone to 2-and-0, we would have walked him," Johnson said. "If 
you make the right pitch, he's easy to double up. But he (Aase) gave him a high 
fastball." 
</P>
<P>
All Manager Whitey Herzog could say was, "That Guerrero sure can hit with men 
on base." 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry's first home run of the season in the sixth inning off 
Cardinal starter Don Heinkel tied the score and three straight singles followed 
to give Dwight Gooden a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden departed in the seventh when the Cardinals tied it. Tom Brunansky opened 
with a double and scored with two out when Willie McGee, out since April 5 with 
a rib injury, delivered a pinch single. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 1, Atlanta 0 -- It was a typical afternoon at Candlestick Park. 
The sun was shining and the wind was swirling. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Smith, who gave up only three hits and struck out 13, lost the game 
because center fielder Dale Murphy lost Kevin Mitchell's fly ball in the 
seventh inning. It went as a two-base error and the Giants won the game when 
Terry Kennedy, one out later, ripped a double that skipped past left fielder 
Lonnie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just another beautiful, balmy day at the 'Stick," Giants' Manager Roger 
Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't all laughs for the Giants, who lead the West with a 7-3 record. Don 
Robinson, who gave up both Atlanta hits in the second inning, stepped in a hole 
on the mound warming up in the sixth and had to leave with a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Atlee Hammaker pitched four hitless innings to get the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mitchell's ball was up in the air, I could've sworn the wind picked up 5 
or 10 m.p.h.," Smith said. "You can't blame Murphy, you can't blame anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Montreal 4 -- With several stars sidelined by injury, the Pirates 
turned to their reserves in this game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Wilson, who platoons in the outfield, hit a two-run home run and utility 
players John Cangelosi and Gary Redus combined to reach base six times. 
</P>
<P>
The two substitutes replaced regulars Andy Van Slyke and Sid Bream, both 
injured Friday night. Bream, who strained a knee, has joined pitcher Jim Gott 
and utilityman Benny Distefano on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunne, who gave up five hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings to win it, 
almost didn't start because of an undisclosed family medical emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 6, San Diego 3 -- Eric Davis hit a three-run home run in the 10th 
inning at San Diego to give the Reds the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Larkin, who homered earlier, singled and went to second on an infield 
out. Kal Daniels walked and Davis followed with his third homer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also had a run-scoring single, and Larkin scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds moved ahead in the top of the eighth, 3-2, but Jack Clark singled in 
the bottom of the inning. Bip Roberts ran for him, stole second and scored the 
tying run on Benito Santiago's single. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BROWN PITCHES RANGERS TO SEVENTH STRAIGHT WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Kevin Brown was struggling to end a long minor league losing 
streak. Now, he's one of the reasons the Rangers are off to their best start in 
17 seasons in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, in his second solid start, pitched a seven-hitter Saturday at Detroit as 
the Rangers, with Scott Fletcher going three for three, beat the Tigers, 4-1. 
The Rangers, who have won seven games in a row, have a 9-1 record and a 2 
1/2-game lead in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a 6-foot 4-inch right-hander from Georgia Tech, was the fourth player 
chosen in the June 1986 draft. But he struggled in the minors. When he lost his 
first three decisions last spring at Tulsa, it increased his losing streak to 
14 games over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with a 12-10 record at Tulsa and was 1-1 with the Rangers at the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, in his first start this season, he gave up four hits and one 
earned run in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he walked one, struck out five and allowed just the one unearned run. 
He also impressed Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"His ball really moves," said Anderson, whose Tigers (2-6) are off to their 
worst start since 1980. "It looked like it had a lot on it. The kid looks like 
he could be a great pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Brown wasn't all that excited about the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go through the kind of seasons I've had, you either learn to accept 
pressure or you sink," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Valentine, a former Dodger starting his fifth season as manager of the 
Rangers, quoted his first major league manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Walter Alston used to say a victory now is just as good as one in September. 
So I'm looking at this as a good time to win," Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Rangers, who have had only one winning year (1986) under Valentine, 
fell to 70-91 last season, there was speculation this was his final shot. 
</P>
<P>
With outstanding pitching and timely hitting, especially from Ruben Sierra and 
Julio Franco, the Rangers are hot. 
</P>
<P>
In the last seven games, they have yielded 15 runs, and only five runs in the 
last four games. They have won five in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
In their only loss this season, they scored nine runs but lost when they failed 
to hold a 9-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 10, Toronto 5 -- Pat Tabler doesn't know why, but he is possibly 
the best bases-loaded hitter in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
Tabler's bases-loaded single in the seventh inning drove home the go-ahead run 
at Toronto, and the Royals added four more in the ninth to sew it up. 
</P>
<P>
In a career spent mainly with the Cleveland Indians, Tabler has displayed an 
uncanny ability to deliver with the bases loaded. Being traded to the Royals 
for pitcher Bud Black hasn't affected this ability. 
</P>
<P>
He is 38 for 66 with the bases full and the hits have produced 90 runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals had to overcome a five-run first in which the Blue Jays hammered 
Bret Saberhagen from the mound before he could get out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Luis Aquino pitched 6 1/3 innings of scoreless relief, and when the Royals 
battled back, he improved his record to 2-0. A former Blue Jay, Aquino has held 
his former team scoreless for 15 2/3 innings in three appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson had three hits, including his third home run, and drove in three of 
the Royals' runs. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 12, Boston 4 -- The new-look Orioles resorted to an old weapon -- the 
three-run home run -- in this game at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheets and Brady Anderson hit the three-run homers in a seven-run ninth 
inning that broke open a tight battle. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Orioles (5-5) into a tie for first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ballard improved his record to 2-0, going 5 2/3 innings and giving up six 
hits and two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Oakland 4 -- Dave Gallagher hit a three-run home run, only the sixth 
homer in his career, to highlight a five-run second inning at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The blow beat pitcher Bob Welch. The runs were unearned, because with two out 
and one on, Steve Lyons grounded to shortstop Mike Gallego. Gallego 
double-pumped on the throw to first and it was called an error. The TV replay 
indicated Lyons was out. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, Cleveland 1 -- Rob Deer hit two home runs at Milwaukee as the 
Brewers ended Tom Candiotti's eight-game winning streak. It was the 
knuckleballer's first defeat since last July 22. 
</P>
<P>
Deer's two-run smash gave Chris Bosio (2-0) a 4-1 lead in the sixth. He his his 
fourth home run of the season in the eighth. DAN HAFNER

SLOW START BY METS GIVES EXPOS AND RODGERS SOME HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the 1989 season is only two weeks old, the New York Mets' staggering 
start has brought new encouragement to Manager Buck Rodgers of the Montreal 
Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five wins will be good enough this year," Rodgers said of the race in 
the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mets won 100 last year, but they have question marks now. I'm not saying 
they're not the team to beat, but they're like the rest of us now." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' 2-5 start through Thursday left them last in the East and was their 
worst since '83, when they went on to lose 93 games. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of an opening-day victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, the Mets 
(now 3-6) scored 13 runs in their next six games, batted .186 and went 56 
innings without a home run. 
</P>
<P>
The middle of the lineup -- Gregg Jefferies, Keith Hernandez, Darryl 
Strawberry, Kevin McReynolds and Gary Carter -- was a combined 23 for 127 in 
that span, a .181 average. 
</P>
<P>
Frustration? Though early, the Mets were already doing some finger-pointing, 
and Manager Dave Johnson seemed on the verge of contradicting himself. 
</P>
<P>
It happened like this: When cross-town counterpart Dallas Green of the New York 
Yankees said at the start of the week that the Yankees stink, Johnson was asked 
what he thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand how you can say something like that, especially in a media 
market like New York," Johnson said. "If it works for some people, fine, but 
it's just not me." 
</P>
<P>
Not, at least, until a couple days later when the Mets lost consecutive games 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates for the first time since 1985 and Johnson seemed 
ready to say the Mets stink as well. 
</P>
<P>
Informed that he was managing a last-place team for the first time in his 
career, Johnson said: "I know that and I'm not handling it too well. My 
patience is wearing thin. I don't like to have meetings, but I'm bearing down 
on one quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, you don't want to be overly concerned, but you do have to be 
concerned. There's a lot of changes I'd like to make, but I don't have enough 
guys on the roster to make them. After starting like this and a (lousy) spring, 
I have questions now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for soul-searching." 
</P>
<P>
It was time for Howard Johnson to blame second baseman Jefferies for not 
catching a throw in the two-run eighth inning of a 4-2 loss to the Pirates 
Thursday, the latest in a series of throwing errors that were expected to send 
third baseman Johnson to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball should have been caught," Howard Johnson said. "It wasn't that bad of 
a throw. Several teammates agreed with me. Ask Tuff." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tim Teufel, who was playing first base: "I don't know. I didn't have a 
good angle on it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jefferies: "I guarantee you I'm not going to let a ball go by if I can get 
it. From where I was, there was no way I could reach it. You know, there's a 
lot of frustration on this team. I'm not saying it's Howard or anyone else. But 
sometimes someone catches a person the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
A rookie of the year candidate at 21, Jefferies figures to age rapidly in the 
Mets' self-detonating atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
How do the Yankees stink? Dallas Green could count the ways. Sloppy 
baserunning. Poor location by pitchers. Even worse logic by pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Green has stopped short of the wall-shaking outbursts that earned 
him the name of Mr. Bluster in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure this club has an understanding of what I'm trying to preach yet," 
Green said of the Yankees, who are 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of the frustration. It's also partly why I haven't busted loose. 
It would be like spanking your kids and they don't know what you're spanking 
them for." 
</P>
<P>
One of the players Green singled out for poor baserunning the other day was 
former Dodger Steve Sax, a player whose spring aggressiveness Green had 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Sax was thrown out attempting to take an extra base on an overthrow against the 
Cleveland Indians, the third time in a non-steal situation that Sax has been 
thrown out. Green called it a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Sax refused to respond to the urging of third-base coach Lee Elia 
and remained at third on Don Slaught's fly to medium center, depriving the 
Yankees of a possible run in a game they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Sax later paced through the clubhouse, mumbling about his new uncertainty on 
the bases to the extent that coach Frank Howard had to settle him down. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bowa, who played under Green, knows how it can be and knows that Green 
will have to repair some bridges with Sax. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys will fight back, some will resent it," Bowa said of Green's style. 
"Other guys will put their tails between their legs and crawl into their 
lockers. Then Dallas could lose them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Green, more concerned with the overall play: "I ain't too sure we could 
beat Peoria right now." 
</P>
<P>
After his team started 1-6, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was quick to 
provide a vote of confidence, saying Green would be there all year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "If we go 1 and 161 I'll be here all year?" 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger Pedro Guerrero, through eight games, has driven in 14 runs for 
the St. Louis Cardinals, including the game-winner in the 10th inning Saturday 
against the Mets. Seven of Guerrero's eight hits came with runners on base, six 
with the runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Said the modest Guerrero: 
</P>
<P>
"Probably 90% of the time I come through, especially with men in scoring 
position. I love to go out there with the pressure of men on base. There's 
pressure on me, but there's pressure on the pitcher, too." 
</P>
<P>
The latest of Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson's "can't miss" rookies is 
former UCLA infielder Torey Lovullo, who put Keith Moreland on the bench but is 
2 for 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll die before he comes out of the lineup," Sparky said of Lovullo. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers lost 12 straight games to the Minnesota Twins before winning, 3-0, 
Thursday night. Said Detroit pitcher Jack Morris: 
</P>
<P>
"People say they're surprised the Twins beat us 12 times. Hey, they're the 
better team." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Danny Jackson of the Cincinnati Reds, winless after his first two 
starts, used a bat to demolish his Riverfront Stadium locker, claiming later it 
was the work of termites. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Kent Tekulve responded by buying Jackson a stand-up plastic punching 
bag called "Whammo," labeled as an "anti-stress device . . . a high tech answer 
to low tech problems." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he would share it with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Advice for the lovelorn? 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Royals' George Brett says Wade Boggs of the Boston Red Sox will 
never escape reminders of the affair with Margo Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll never end. Look at me," Brett said. "It's been nine years since the 
hemorrhoid thing in the World Series and I still hear about it. The pine-tar 
incident was in 1983 but I still hear fans yell about it every time I put on a 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs, who hit all seven of his home 
runs on the road last year, hit his first ever at Wrigley Field in Tuesday's 
5-4 victory over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Said the relieved Grace: 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I picked up a magazine or newspaper it was, 'incredibly, Mark Grace 
did not hit a home run at Wrigley Field last year.' King Kong is off my back 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Brewers' Terry Francona, who broke up Nolan Ryan's latest bid for 
a no-hitter, was surprised to hear Ryan describe him as one of the toughest he 
faced in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm one of the toughest, I'd sure hate to see the guys he owns," Francona 
said. "Let's put it this way . . . when I see his name in the pitching 
probables, I don't exactly run to the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Add Ryan: It was the 23rd time he has struck out 15 or more batters in a game. 
He did it all with fastballs, throwing only 11 curveballs and only one for a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Said Milwaukee's Rob Deer: "He couldn't get his curveball over. When he does, I 
hear he's nearly unhittable."

<P>
History: The Cleveland Indians' sweep of the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium 
was their first since 1966, a span covering six U.S. presidents and 11 
Cleveland managers. 
</P>
<P>
Power Supply: First baseman Glenn Davis of the Houston Astros has hit three 
home runs in 50 at-bats. The rest of the Astros have one homer in 388 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Boooone: The Kansas City Royals' 5-4 loss to the Baltimore Orioles in 15 
innings Wednesday had a major impact on Bob Boone's statistics. The ex-Angel 
catcher went hitless in seven at-bats, dropping his batting average 122 points 
to .333. He was also charged with two passed balls after being cited with only 
one in 122 games last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pitch: Right-hander Dave Stieb of the Toronto Blue Jays credits 
improvements in his slider for the fact he has thrown three one-hitters in his 
last four starts going back to last year and pitched four shutouts in his last 
five, allowing just one run and 11 hits in 44 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Relief: The Chicago Cubs' Mitch Williams, acquired from the Texas Rangers in 
the Rafael Palmeiro deal, had five saves in five opportunities through Friday, 
though he had allowed nine hits and four walks in 6 1/3 innings, not to mention 
a balk and throwing error. Williams had bailed himself out with eight 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Derricked: Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, whom the Boston Red Sox hoped would fill the 
breach left by Bruce Hurst, has an 11.25 earned-run average after two starts, 
proving his spring ERA of 7.43 was no fluke. Boyd hasn't won since Aug. 26 and 
hasn't pitched a complete game since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Poll: The Minneapolis Star Tribune asked readers whether they support Frank 
Viola, who has rejected a three-year, $7.9-million offer from the Minnesota 
Twins and said he will leave as a free agent when the season ends, or the club. 
Viola received 611 votes. The Twins got 5,061. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff: How happy were the Milwaukee Brewers to see Paul Molitor come off the 
disabled list Friday night? The four players they had used in the leadoff role 
this season were a combined 0 for 24 before Mike Felder got a bunt single in 
the fifth inning of Thursday night's game against the Texas Rangers. ROSS

FOX GETS FOURTH VAULTING TITLE FOR NEW MEXICO

Chad Fox of New Mexico overcame a leg injury in an earlier event to become the 
first man to win four consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Assn. gymnastics 
event titles when he took the vaulting title Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's teammate, Paul O'Neill, also captured his third consecutive rings 
championship, only the sixth person to win three event titles in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels fantastic," said Fox, who had an ankle injury from the floor 
exercise. "When I was a freshman I wanted to be the first to win four on the 
floor and four on the vault and be the first gymnast to win eight (NCAA 
titles). The floor didn't go so well, but at least I won the vault." 
</P>
<P>
The 9.95s by O'Neill and Houston Baptist's Alfonzo Rodriguez to tie for first 
on the rings were the highest mark of the three-day meet to that point. One of 
the four judges gave O'Neill a perfect 10 on his event. 
</P>
<P>
In the final event of the evening, Rodriguez's teammate, Miguel Rubio also 
recorded a 9.95 to win his second consecutive high bar title. Rubio also 
received one 10 from the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Before Fox, the last to win three in a row was Nebraska's former gold-medal 
Olympian Jim Hartung, also on the rings, in 1980, '81 and '82. Hartung also 
holds the record with seven NCAA individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
"That puts me up there with Jim Hartung," O'Neill said. "To be compared with 
anyone that good is a nice feeling. With guys like Miguel and Alfonso I knew it 
would take a hell of a rings set to win." 
</P>
<P>
Rubio followed O'Neill with a 9.9 and Rodriguez followed with a 9.95. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the meet, Fox failed in his bid for a second floor exercise title 
when he scored 9.3 to finish well back of winner Jody Newman of Arizona State 
at 9.85. Fox won his floor event championship in 1987 and was second a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's Mark Sohn shared the pommel horse title for a second consecutive 
year, this time with UCLA's Chris Waller, both with 9.85s. Sohn and Houston 
Baptist's Rodriguez shared the pommel horse title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I hit my routines I would be happy with any place I got," Sohn said. 
"First is great." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez came back on the parallel bars to score a 9.8 to gain that title 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska's Patrick Kirksey held on to his optional lead through Saturday 
afternoon's compulsories to win the all-around title. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey scored 112.60 points to 111.65 for runner-up Mike Racanelli of Ohio 
State and third-place David St. Pierre of UCLA ended with 111.50. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey led Racanelli and St. Pierre by two-tenths and 35-hundredths of a 
point, respectively, after Thursday night's optional round. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited," Kirksey said. The Husker junior said Rodriguez informed him 
earlier in the week the Houston Baptist stars wouldn't be competing in the 
all-around compulsories because of injuries. They elected instead to 
concentrate on individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he didn't compete because he probably would have beaten me," Kirksey 
said of Rodriguez. "But as a friend, I feel sorry that he didn't compete." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey scored a 9.5 on the floor exercise, 9.15 on the rings and pommel horse, 
9.6 on the vault, 9.05 on the parallel bars and 8.65 on the high bar to 
complete his compulsory round Saturday. He had a 1.2-point lead over Racanelli 
heading into their final event -- the high bar. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey fell in his high bar routine in Friday night's team final, in which 
Nebraska finished second to Illinois. He had a break in the routine again 
Saturday but Racanelli, the nation's second-ranked all-arounder, was unable to 
take advantage when he scored an 8.9. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to do well for the team," Kirksey said. "It's a good momentum 
builder (for next year) and it really excites me because I know there are a lot 
of guys who will be graduating. What I'm looking for next year is the team. I 
think we're going to have a great team next year."

Nebraska's Patrick Kirksey held his optional lead through Saturday's 
compulsories to win the men's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. all-around 
gymnastics title. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey scored 112.60 points to 111.65 for runner-up Mike Racanelli of Ohio 
State and 111.50 for third-place David St. Pierre of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey led Racanelli and St. Pierre by 0.2 and 0.35 of a point, respectively, 
after Thursday night's optional round. The top 24 competitors advanced from 
those preliminaries to Saturday's all-around finals. 
</P>
<P>
Houston Baptist's Alfonzo Rodriguez, the nation's top-ranked all-around gymnast 
this season and second at the NCAA a year ago, and his teammate Miguel Rubio, 
the defending NCAA all-around champion, elected to withdraw from the all-around 
competition Saturday afternoon because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
Rubio had been fourth and Rodriguez sixth in the all-around after the optionals 
but both elected to forgo the six-event all-around to concentrate on their runs 
at individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the all-around rotations Saturday afternoon Nebraska's Mark 
Warburton and Bob Stelter moved into third and fourth ahead of St. Pierre after 
St. Pierre scored an 8.05 on the rings. But Warburton failed to score in the 
vault and Stelter slipped to a fourth-place finish after an 8.95 on the 
parallel bars. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey turned in a 9.50 on the floor exercise, 9.15 on the rings, 9.6 on the 
vault, 9.05 on the parallel bars, 9.15 on the pommel horse and 8.65 on the high 
bar to complete his compulsory round Saturday. He had a 1.2-point lead over 
Racanelli heading into their final event -- the high bar. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey had fallen in his high bar routine in Friday night's team final, in 
which Nebraska finished second to Illinois. He had a break in the routine again 
Saturday but Racanelli was unable to take advantage of it when he turned in an 
8.9. 
</P>
<P>
Racanelli, the nation's second-ranked all-around competitor this season, had an 
8.55 on the pommel horse, an 8.85 on the parallel bars, a 9.0 on the rings, 9.3 
on the vault and 9.6 on the floor exercise.

UCLA'S HAMILTON WINS TWO TITLES AS BRUINS IMPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's Kim Hamilton won an unprecedented third consecutive individual 
championship in the floor exercise Saturday night when she tied Georgia's 
Corrinne Wright for first place to highlight the final day of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's gymnastics championships at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, 20, a junior from Richmond, Va., also won the vault with an NCAA 
tournament record of 9.75 points as the Bruin women were impressive. Hamilton's 
and Wright's scores of 9.90 in the floor exercise also set a meet record. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, seeded No. 1 in the tournament, was upset in the team competition Friday 
night, losing to Georgia by five-hundredths of a point. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Wener of Georgia recorded the first 10.0 score ever given in the NCAA 
women's gymnastics championships to win the uneven bar competition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Jill Andrews, 20, a junior from Cupertino, Calif., tied Oregon State's 
Jill Selig for first in the balance beam with a score of 9.80. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, the defending national vault champion, was second behind Hamilton at 
9.725 in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Service, 22, a senior from St. Charles, Mo., in her last competition as a 
Bruin, tied for third in the vault at 9.675, tied for fourth in the uneven bars 
at 9.750 and tied for fourth in the floor at 9.78. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' Shawn McGinnis, 19, a junior from Anaheim Hills, tied for sixth in 
the floor exercise at 9.55. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who did not place in the vault last year, was satisfied with her 
performance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt really good," Hamilton said in a news conference at Georgia Coliseum. 
"I had had problems coming into today. Yesterday (Friday) I didn't stick of my 
vaults. I was having problems yesterday with that and it felt good to do well." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Hamilton decided to change her floor routine although she 
won two consecutive national titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I should do something new this year," she said. "I wanted the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Dolan of Cal State Fullerton placed eighth in the vault at 9.35, and 
eighth on beam at 9.15.

U.S. OPENS 3RD ROUND TODAY IN COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 39 years of failure, the United States has its best chance yet of 
advancing to soccer's World Cup finals as it opens the third round of 
qualifying for the 1990 competition today against Costa Rica at San Jose, Costa 
Rica. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. midfielder Hugo Perez will miss the game because of an injury, and captain 
Rick Davis is doubtful after arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which had a first-round bye, advanced to the third round by 
defeating Jamaica last summer. Costa Rica, the country that eliminated the 
United States from the 1986 World Cup, beat Panama and then got a bye when 
Mexico was expelled from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is 1-1 so far in the third round, losing to Guatemala, 1-0, on March 
19 and beating Guatemala, 2-1, on April 2. Other teams in the third round are 
El Salvador, and Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
Strong recent performances have made the United States a favorite to be one of 
the two teams from the Central and North American and Caribbean region 
(CONCACAF) to advance to the tournament in Italy next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"In our neck of the woods, we've achieved parity," U.S. national team Coach Bob 
Gansler said. "I'm impressed with the speed of the Costa Ricans and the way 
they move on the field, but we came here confident of victory." 
</P>
<P>
With Mexico barred from international competition for two years for using 
over-age players in qualifying for the under-20 world championships, and Canada 
already eliminated, two of the United States' major adversaries in the region 
have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a favorite (in the region)," Gansler said. "If anybody 
feels this is going to be a cakewalk, they are sadly mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
The United States will play the return match against Costa Rica on April 30 at 
Fenton, Mo., and play host to Trinidad and Tobago on May 13 at El Camino 
College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the United States plays Guatemala in New Britain, Conn. on June 10. It 
plays in El Salvador on July 9 and in Guatemala on Oct. 8. The final two games 
will be played at yet to be determined U.S. sites against El Salvador on Nov. 5 
and in Trinidad and Tobago on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The United States last played in the World Cup in 1950 -- when participation 
was by invitation. Since then, they have failed to qualify in nine consecutive 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
After a successful Olympic qualifying performance, an encouraging Olympic 
showing, a third-place finish in the world indoor championships in the 
Netherlands in January and a surprisingly strong, fourth-place finish in the 
under-20 world championships in Saudi Arabia in February, the United States 
team has gained confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"To put us in the World Cup will make us a legitimate host to the 1994 World 
Cup," forward Brent Goulet said. "For the players who stuck it out in soccer 
when there really was nowhere for them to play in this country . . . for all 
these players, for us to keep their dream alive is so important." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the team's approach has changed considerably since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," he said, "we were in a group with Canada and Mexico. When we went down 
to Mexico, the attitude on the team was 'Well let's try to keep it as close as 
possible.' Whereas when we went down to El Salvador last year as part of the 
Olympic qualifying it was: 'Hey, let's see if we can't really run this score 
up.' 
</P>
<P>
"The overall attitude is completely different." 
</P>
<P>
Improved confidence came during the indoor championships in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"What we got out of the indoor championships is that they're human and that we 
have the skill," Goulet said. "We can beat those teams." 
</P>
<P>
The team has been able to maintain continuity by placing more than a dozen 
players under contract, which has kept the players together. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet, Perez, Bruce Murray and Peter Vermes consistently have made up the 
offensive threat over the last two years. Davis has anchored a midfield with 
Tab Ramos, John Harkes and Jim Gabarra, and Mike Windischmann has formed the 
base of the defense with Paul Caligiuri and Brian Bliss. 
</P>
<P>
David Vanole has been the No. 1 goalkeeper over the past two years but now has 
yielded that role to his backup, Jeff Duback.

THE BIG BARONESS AND THE LITTLE JEW; 
</P>
<P>
MARRIED LIFE BY DAVID VOGEL TRANSLATED BY DALYA BILU (GROVE PRESS: $18.95; 486 
PP.; 0-8021-1129-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Brian Hall, Hall is the author of Stealing From a Deep Place: Travels in 
Southeastern Europe (Hill &amp; Wang) and The Dreamers (Harper &amp; Row), a 
novel set in contemporary Vienna. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poet and novelist David Vogel (1891-1944) lived and died a guilty man. For 
the inescapable crime of being what he was, he was imprisoned three times -- 
first by the Austrians, during World War I, for having been born in Russian 
Poland (he was therefore a Russian enemy alien); then by the French, at the 
outbreak of World War II, for having lived in Vienna (he was therefore an 
Austrian enemy alien); finally by the Nazis, for his most heinous crime (he was 
a Jew). Vogel died in 1944, probably at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel's sole novel, "Married Life," was originally published in Hebrew in 1929; 
it is only now appearing for the first time in English. One infers, on the 
evidence of this single work, that Vogel learned early to expect no better from 
life than what he actually got, for "Married Life" is merciless in its 
depiction of a bleak world in which fate is both arbitrary and supremely 
malign. 
</P>
<P>
That world is Vienna after World War I, which Vogel knew well from more than a 
decade's residence -- a milieu of economic and social decay. Vogel's novel is 
peopled almost exclusively with victims and victimizers. Chief among the former 
is the protagonist, Rudolf Gurdweill, a poor Jewish writer who in the opening 
pages meets by (malign) chance his cruel complement, the almost-as-poor 
Baroness Thea von Takow, a tall, blond and fair fury with eyes of steely blue 
-- emphatically not a Jew. Vogel is uninterested in maintaining suspense: Of 
Gurdweill's first sighting of the baroness, he writes, "Gurdweill could not 
take his eyes off her. He suddenly felt a vague unease, as if at the 
premonition of disaster." 
</P>
<P>
When fate is inevitable, premonitions never miscarry. Recognizing this, on some 
level, Gurdweill embraces his scourge (only the first of many times in the 
novel that he will court disaster) and his and Thea's relationship progresses 
with convenient, if highly improbable, speed. At their second meeting, the 
baroness suddenly proposes marriage -- nothing but the title of the book has 
prepared us for this -- and when Gurdweill accepts, she takes him to a shabby 
hotel room where she attacks him "like a beast of prey," bites him with "a 
cruel, bloodthirsty expression on her face" and more or less rapes him. For his 
part, the diminutive Gurdweill nearly faints "with pain and desire at once." 
</P>
<P>
And we're off and running. Vogel's chronicles of the eponymous life of this 
sadomasochistic couple keeps belying one's conviction that things could not 
possibly get worse. The baroness is unfaithful, and so open about it that 
Gurdweill's unwillingness to suspect her becomes ludicrous, irritating. 
Gurdweill desperately wants a son, and when Thea becomes pregnant she taunts 
him with assertions that the child is not his (it clearly isn't), yet he 
refuses to believe this also, and takes sole care of the child when it is born, 
leaving Thea free for more affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel seems at first to be intending an allegory -- the publisher's blurb 
affirms as much -- of the Viennese Jews' relationship with their city: Vienna 
nurtured an exuberant rise in anti-Semitism between the wars, to which many 
Jews turned a blind eye, unable to believe that European Jewry's most 
illustrious and assimilated community could be annihilated by barbarians as 
comic-book black as the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
The characters certainly seem allegorical, since they don't stand up well as 
believable people -- none of Gurdweill's sketchy past explains his exhausting 
hypersensitivity, his chronic need for abasement; and Thea is simply a monster, 
without a shred of human feeling other than a rampant and unquenchable thirst 
for giving pain. 
</P>
<P>
But curiously, after one or two nods in the direction of allegory -- such as 
Gurdweill telling his friend Ulrich that Thea has "something of the old 
Viennese tradition" about her -- Vogel fails to carry it through. Thea is 
actually not much of an anti-Semite: Her simplistic Nietzschean pronouncements 
about the rule of the strong (the pop-sociology of that period) are directed 
against her husband not because he is a Jew, but because he is weak, and her 
sadism is just too energetic, too generalized, to admit of racial restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, curiously, whiffs of anti-Semitism emanate from the book itself: Vogel 
makes Gurdweill positively grotesque in his slavishness, repeatedly contrasting 
his "skinny, underdeveloped, almost hairless" body with the tall, erect and 
strong Thea who picks him up, throws him around, rocks him in her arms in her 
moments of ursine affection and calls him "Rabbit," a moniker which is unfair, 
as the old joke goes, only to the rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
Gurdweill kisses the hand that beats him, stammering, "You don't know how 
m-much you mean to me . . . I would be prepared to take anything from you." 
When, after his first night with her, Gurdweill stands in the street, battered, 
bruised, but sick with love and longing, "enslaved to her, to this strapping 
blond girl, forever" the parallel that comes to mind is Richard Wagner's 
Alberich, the loathsome dwarfish Jew-caricature of "Das Rheingold," pining 
after the haughty Aryan Rhinemaidens. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfying in the big ways, "Married Life" can be good in the small. When the 
child is born, Gurdweill has something to love other than Thea, and his 
tenderness for the baby is nicely evoked; he becomes fleetingly sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the minor characters, although as bizarre and flat as the major ones, 
remain vivid, thanks to their brief time on the stage. Franzl Heidelberger, for 
example, bemoans his wife's unfaithfulness when he is drunk, but is cheerfully 
determined, all the rest of the time, on getting his wife and Gurdweill to 
sleep together. Thea's brother, the gawky young Freddy, is a compulsive talker 
and sniggerer who likes to strangle cats. 
</P>
<P>
As the lunatics multiply, the novel takes on the aspect of a fever-dream. The 
best parts of the book, in fact, are the long dream sequences in the latter 
third, in which Gurdweill's mind, pushed to the brink by Thea, lurches from one 
wild fantasy to another; here, Vogel maintains a masterful balance between 
convincingly random confusion and subtle symbolic resonance, in which the 
influence of the early Freud influence is unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
But a book of nearly 500 pages needs to provide an emotional connection, no 
matter how small or perverse, to keep the reader reading, and except for the 
brief middle stretch when the baby is alive, "Married Life" lacks one. Slowly 
-- too slowly -- Gurdweill spirals ever lower, unable to exert the slightest 
energy to save himself. His single decisive act, at the novel's end, comes too 
late: One closes the book not with a sense of outrage but with a resignation so 
deep it is indistinguishable from indifference.

<TEXT>
<P>
"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric," Theodor Adorno wrote, thereby 
contradicting himself. The celebrated epigram is itself a form of poetry, of 
course; and written not simply after Auschwitz, but about it. 
</P>
<P>
It is a large contradiction. It has haunted the art inspired by the Holocaust 
and fueled a perennial debate about such art. The late Primo Levi, to take one 
example, was criticized for suggesting that the human spirit flared in the 
death camps, against the odds. "Trivializing the horror" is the essence of the 
charge brought against his and other literary explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Is there something grotesque in writing beautifully about this ultimate horror? 
Levi was not concerned with beauty but with truth. Only, as a scientist, he was 
accustomed to seeking truth in the harmonies of form and process; in the 
symmetry of a crystal, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Others have found it necessary to imprint an antithetical harshness, an 
unaesthetic excess on their forms and images. It is a kind of deliberate 
self-denial; an element of punishment seeded into the work to counter the 
unbearable notion of profiting, even artistically, from awfulness. One could 
consider the length of the film "Shoah," for instance, as not simply the time 
needed to tell a story, but as an incarceration meant to bring us closer to the 
imprisonment of the human spirit among Poles who remained indifferent to what 
was going on in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
David Grossman, a gifted young Israeli novelist, has found some startling new 
light in his massive and complex novel about the Holocaust. He has tacked up a 
dazzling circuitry between nightmare and hope. 
</P>
<P>
"See Under: Love" possesses moments of hair-raising beauty and discovery. They 
are knotted into forms and styles that sometimes obscure them and leave them 
accessible only at a price. We struggle to get through; in that struggle, we 
are exercised, illuminated, and perhaps resentful at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"See Under: Love" is divided into four sections, each written in a drastically 
different style. In the first, Momik, a frail and gifted child, lives with his 
parents in Israel and tries to explain to himself the nature of the terrible 
events that have left his family and their friends broken and fearful, and with 
tattooed numbers on their arms. 
</P>
<P>
Momik's childhood is narrated in a thick, rich patois that, in translation, 
comes across as Yiddish-inflected English. It is the speech that Momik's 
Polish-born parents have taught him, drawn out into a child's associative 
stream of consciousness that can run a single sentence for two pages. 
</P>
<P>
It can be heavy going, but the story is astonishing and infinitely touching. 
Nobody wants to tell Momik about the past. Using his imagination, the scraps of 
information and misinformation he picks up, the children's adventures he reads, 
he constructs his own theory about the "Nazi Beast." 
</P>
<P>
It lives in his cellar, he decides, invisibly. It is up to him, Momik, "to find 
the Nazi Beast and tame it and make it good and persuade it to change its 
ways." It is a battle he pursues, using all kinds of childish means, on behalf 
of his parents. "He's fighting like a partisan. Undercover. All alone. So that 
finally they'll be able to forget and relax a little, and stop being so scared 
for once in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Momik will have a breakdown. In the second section of the book he reappears, 
grown up and a writer. He is on the same quest but now he takes a byway. He 
comes to Gdansk, on the Baltic Sea, to pursue the ghost of Bruno Schulz, a 
Polish writer killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
He stands on the shore and engages in a dialogue with the sea. It tells him of 
Schulz being adopted by a giant school of salmon, conducted through various 
piscine adventures and transformations, and finally becoming a fish himself. 
The language is surreal and lush; the fantasy churns along with great energy 
and dim purpose. The sea talks; the sea is a bore. 
</P>
<P>
After this watery detour, things pick up. Momik now uses everything he has ever 
known -- his childhood, his wanderings, his studies -- to pursue his Nazi Beast 
quest in still another form. Now, as a mature artist, he will devise a fable 
that will indeed tame it, if not exactly make it nice. 
</P>
<P>
The fable tells of Anshel Wasserman, Momik's great-uncle and author of a vastly 
successful prewar series of children's adventure stories. Anshel is thrown into 
a death camp, but after a while the guards bring him before Neigel, the camp 
commandant. Neigel's men have tried to kill Anshel three times -- by shooting, 
gas and a truck -- but he doesn't die. Anshel is apologetic; it is some kind of 
disorder, he explains; perhaps a doctor should be called. 
</P>
<P>
Neigel is the emotionless bureaucrat-butcher. Anshel's problem infuriates him, 
but it intrigues him too. He is further intrigued to learn that the prisoner is 
the author of the adventure series he used to read as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Neigel proposes that Anshel shall live in Neigel's attic, work his 
garden and, like Scheherazade, tell him a story each night. Anshel objects 
that, far from wanting to live, he wants to die. They agree that after each 
story, Neigel will shoot him. It will do no good, of course, since Anshel is 
unable to die. 
</P>
<P>
The story he tells is a strange updating of his old children's adventures. 
Those were about a band of super-kids, of various races and nationalities, who 
traveled around the world doing good and righting wrongs. The band called 
itself The Children of the Heart. 
</P>
<P>
In Anshel's nightly telling, the Children have grown old and formed an 
underground community in the Warsaw zoo. There they raise Kazik, a doomed and 
miraculous child who lives an entire life, up to age 65, in the space of 22 
hours and 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Anshel gradually gains an ascendancy over the Nazi boss by means of his 
extended story. A chaotic human sensibility begins to awaken in this inhuman 
figure. And Grossman shifts into a new narrative device in the form of entries 
in an encyclopedia. It is a post-modern usage, intended to deconstruct the 
proprietorial narrator. It is briefly irritating, but Grossman has too much to 
tell for it to matter one way or the other for very long. 
</P>
<P>
The breaking down of Neigel, who tries to bully the story his way, only to 
submit each time to Anshel's artistic dictatorship, the portrait of Anshel 
himself, with his artist's vanity and his redemptive mission, and the 
marvelously varied stories within Anshel's narrative, are an imaginative 
bonfire that light up the book's final sections. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the fire smokes. The reader will not be transported; he must bring 
his own boots and use them. The book's oddly radiant theme must be worked for; 
the author contorts himself to earn the right to speak plainly. 
</P>
<P>
The characters in Anshel's story -- the saintly Children of the Heart, now in 
their 70s and conducting a kind of anti-Nazi resistance; Kazik with his tragic 
and instant life and death -- all these gradually take Neigel over. He will 
kill himself, but before he does, he begs to be allowed to create a fictional 
character of his own to join the Children. 
</P>
<P>
Anshel has his characters argue the point. Albert, one of the children, finds 
Neigel's fictional personage "too raw." But Otto, the leader, says that he must 
be allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we seek the greatest and most humanitarian motives, Albert, we must 
never for a single moment forget to have mercy because otherwise we're no 
better than they are, may their names be blotted out." 
</P>
<P>
A blessing and a curse in the same sentence. Neigel, the butcher, hangs in the 
extraordinary eschatological half-light that Grossman has come upon. Even for 
the damned there can be mercy. In the context of the Holocaust, this is an 
astonishing, perhaps a scandalous, and certainly an extraordinary and valiant 
message.

THE NEW PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS MILLER, Miller's American Apocalypse: The Destruction and Rebuilding of 
Chicago, will be published early next year by the University of Chicago 
Press.Homeless people in London at the turn of the century. From Jack London, 
People of the Abyss (J. Simon: 29500 Heathercliff Road, Malibu, Calif. 90265: 
$24.95). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans have developed a fascination with the homeless. A while back, The 
Times View section ran a story about a homeless man, neither the stereotyped 
beggar nor the a cappella crazy talking to himself but a scholar without a 
university position or research grant out on the street. Forty-seven-year-old 
Irvin Matus was researching a book at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 
Washington, without a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Matus was not the first of the celebrity homeless. Billy Boggs, a New York City 
bag woman appropriated the name of a local male television personality and 
first refused Mayor Koch's invitation and then resisted his coercion to enter a 
shelter. Briefly famous after an article in People, she appeared on the 
"Donahue" show and was asked to lecture at Harvard on her street experiences. 
Film offers followed until she was discovered back on the street cursing at 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 1, 1989, editorial, the New York Times described a surreal 
interaction at Grand Central Station between homeless people and some realistic 
sculptures made to look like homeless people by artists like George Segal and 
Duane Hansen. Complete, for the moment, with its own aesthetic, homelessness 
has found its way out of the shadows and into a half-way zone between 
frustrated social concern and spectacle. The aesthetic is indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
Although more visible during the Reagan years, homelessness is not a phenomenon 
of the '80s but the stubborn underside of the modern dream of steady 
uninterrupted progress. In the summer of 1902, Jack London observed and wrote 
about similar conditions in England. London's model for his study, which he 
entitled "People of the Abyss," was W. T. Stead's best-selling expose, "If 
Christ Came to Chicago" (1894). An Englishman, Stead had come to America during 
the Columbian Exposition, a celebration of technology and American power, and 
had walked along the edge of the great fair to report mass homelessness and 
urban dislocation. So great was the problem of housing that thousands were 
compelled to sleep each night in Chicago's elaborate new city hall. Returning 
the favor, London wrote about his experiences among the English poor in "People 
of the Abyss," republished in a handsome, edition by Joseph Simon. 
</P>
<P>
London's work is a classic literary treatment of the underside of urban life, 
the nightmare that continues to disturb our glamour-fantasies of leveraged 
buyouts and endless nights on the town. For London, an American pragmatist in 
the rigorous sense of the word that his contemporary William James employed, 
"theories become instruments, not answers to enigmas, in which we can rest." 
London neither moralizes about poverty nor generalizes his feelings but 
dresses, instead, in the old clothes of a common sailor and lives on the street 
in order to report an alien condition. He makes sharp distinctions, 
distinguishing between working poor and indigent, between the tramp perpetually 
looking for work and the bum hopeless of ever finding it. 
</P>
<P>
For London, the homeless are not a people apart, a roving army assaulting us 
alternately for charity or for pity. No, they are unadorned versions of 
ourselves driven to extremes. Neither contemptuous nor sentimental, London's 
letters from this time (Stanford University Press, 1988) reveal a man 
struggling to face the facts about something that he once arrogantly thought he 
knew. Initiated as a quick project to publish a new book, to get away from a 
bad marriage and make some money, "People of the Abyss" begins to claim him. 
Posing as an East London local (anticipating the antics of Dan Rather costumed 
as an Afghan freedom fighter or Geraldo Rivera on a drug bust), Jack London, 
already famous as a legitimate adventurer and radical, finds when out on the 
street himself that "the human soul is a lonely thing." Even with some gold 
coins sewn into the lining of his coat, he imagines the terror of unrelieved 
poverty. London describes for Anna Strunsky, a former lover back home, what has 
been happening to him. He writes, "You can live by theory, and therein you 
approach perfection. I blunder at living by theory. At first I did too much 
living by practice. They failed to catch me when I was young. . . . I have seen 
men's eyes here, &amp; women's, that I was almost afraid to look in -- not 
because of the viciousness therein, nor the sensuality, or anything of the 
sort, but because of the utter lack of all these, because of the supreme 
bestiality or unhumanness." 
</P>
<P>
In the current period of transition between the years of greed that 
characterized the '80s and the advertised new gentleness of the Bush '90s, 
reading "People of the Abyss" is not a bad exercise. Jack London provides a way 
to examine our own motives. In a letter to some friends, he hints at a method 
for understanding what surrounds us today. He writes: "I've read of misery, and 
seen a bit; but this beats anything I could even have imagined. Actually, I 
have seen things, &amp; looked the second time in order to convince myself that 
it was really so." 
</P>
<P>
Looking the second time is critical. Seeing twice within the same short moment 
forces us out of our habitual stances of piety, sentimentality or annoyance. 
When we keep our eyes fixed until we see, we risk reconsidering some seemingly 
fixed notions of family life and the moral causes of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
What London saw was the flower of the English countryside blighted by life in 
the city. He reports, "Year by year, and decade after decade, rural England 
pours in a flood of vigorous strong life." But that vigor "not only does not 
renew itself, but perishes by the third generation." Stripping himself of his 
own sentimentality, London sees beyond the feelings he wants to entertain. The 
people he interviews and spends time with are lost. He reports the toll of 
having to live off handouts and unreliable public charity. Herded about day 
after day, denied adequate shelter but forbidden to sleep in the parks, "the 
dominant note of their lives is materialistic. They are stupid and heavy 
without imagination." The Abyss becomes a "huge killing machine." 
</P>
<P>
Written at the beginning of the century, London's work still carries the 
passion of a man unafraid to question his own assumptions. The twin addictions 
of our culture to irony and narcissism make it difficult to match him in 
confronting something as refractory and unpleasant as homelessness. In one 
mode, we tend to affect a sophisticated note of knowing unconcern, while in the 
other, we tell each other how bad the last unpleasant street encounter made us 
feel. London's work remains valuable because it forces us to re-imagine 
homelessness as more than a social problem for the few unfortunates. In 
demythologizing progress, or its New World variant the "American Dream," he 
allows us to see ourselves as part of a problem and not apart from it. By 
dressing up and voyaging down, he explores the depressive side of a society, 
like ours, always looking for a quick fix or release from the terror of the 
soul.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A WORLD OF IDEAS BY BILL MOYERS (DOUBLEDAY: $24.95; 432 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporting events and political rhetoric without examining underlying trends and 
ideas, nonfiction programming on television is not renowned for its subtlety of 
thought. For a few months beginning last September, however, Bill Moyers 
managed to imbue the airwaves with a more reflective spirit in the PBS series, 
"A World of Ideas." Regular readers of literature will be familiar with many of 
Moyers' subjects -- from Isaac Asimov to Derek Walcott -- but this book, based 
on edited transcripts of the show, should still be of interest, for Moyers 
doesn't lower the level of dialogue for TV. On the contrary, he consistently 
focuses these conversations through thoughtful comments and enlivens them by 
playing provocateur. 
</P>
<P>
Moyers is clearly fond of this latter role. In his interview with Northrop 
Frye, for instance, he playfully puts the Canadian literary critic on the 
defensive by confronting him with a number of stereotypes (e.g., "Canadians are 
so friendly that they even say, 'Thank you' to a bank machine"). In many other 
dialogues, Moyers takes just the opposite role, tempering his subjects' 
extremes of optimism and pessimism. While Joseph Heller paints a bleak picture 
of American politics, for instance ("It is the function of a leader in a 
democracy, if he wishes to be a leader, to manipulate the emotions and ideas of 
the public"), Moyers gently counters Heller's cynicism ("But, like taxes, isn't 
politics the price we pay for civilization?"), leading Heller to acknowledge 
that "There's no other government that we can envision that we would prefer to 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Moyers' conclusion is a minor problem in these pages. Attempting to avoid 
partisanship, he claims that the only consensus most of these thinkers reach is 
that "we can best negotiate the future through a multitude of shared acts." In 
fact, Moyers' subjects agree on many issues, such as the need to require our 
politicians to speak more spontaneously. Were Moyers to have stressed these 
areas of agreement, he might have been able to give his world of ideas greater 
clout in the world of action, since squabbling intellectuals are usually the 
first to be ignored in politics. One gathers that Moyers would favor such 
influence, for as he writes, "the men and women who shared their ideas in the 
series are public thinkers. Their Ivory Tower is just a mailing address; they 
are at home in the world."

DEFENDING THE PENTAGON

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your review of "The Pentagonists" and "The Whistle Blowers" (Book 
Review, March 19): 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that choosing a member of the military establishment (Col. Harry 
G. Summers Jr.) to review books about Pentagon corruption is a little like 
having Al Capone review an expose of the Mafia, and the results were just about 
as predictable. I'll give him this -- Summers is a pretty good hatchet man. He 
used all the tricks: avoid the real issues, bring in a lot of irrelevant 
nonsense like the Trilateralists, and divert attention from the message by 
attacking and ridiculing the messenger. The problem is, he forgot to review the 
book.

Even the die-hard bibliophile will admit: It's tough to read in April. The 
freesias are in bloom, the dormant vegetable garden is tapping its foot 
impatiently, wondering if this is the weekend you'll get around to planting the 
seedlings, and there's an hour more of daylight to distract you from settling 
down with a good read. Restaurateurs complain that April is, indeed, the 
cruelest month, because no one wants to come in from out of doors to eat 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
What you need is a novel that doesn't demand a lot, one that you can pick up 
any time without feeling lost. This batch of blockbusters are from the deja vu 
school of fiction: Even if you haven't read these particular books, you've 
undoubtedly read a lot of others just like them.

Take A Morning Affair by Janice Kaplan. Jackie Rogers is, Janet Malcolm be 
damned, an honorable, hard-working television journalist of tremendous 
integrity who happens to be a raving beauty, which makes for a lot of moral 
turmoil for our heroine. Will the folks at A.M. Reports, the national morning 
show, appreciate her for her mind, or will they attempt to turn Jackie into 
just another overpaid, oversprayed airhead? Will she keep dating Julian, the 
enigmatic silver baron, or will she recognize true love when she meets him in 
the editing room? 
</P>
<P>
If her ethics wilt a bit in the process -- Jackie finishes off the silver baron 
with a lover's sell-out disguised as a journalist's coup -- this was never a 
novel about journalism, after all. Besides, the guy clearly asked for it. He 
had the audacity to make zillions of dollars without telling his reporter 
girlfriend how he did it. Ah, those secretive men. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's secretive in Stephen Birmingham's Shades of Fortune and with good 
cause: The members of the Myerson family, all beneficiaries of dear departed 
Dad's cosmetics empire, are master tacticians. Son Edwee and daughter Nonie are 
locked in a battle for tottering Mom's money and/or artwork, while their sister 
Mimi, the elegant, if superstitious, heroine of the tale, tries to salvage both 
the cosmetic company and her floundering marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is fiction, where life contradicts the nonfiction odds, she 
manages both: She comes up with a signature fragrance and fends off a hostile 
takeover from an ex-lover (just so we don't think her husband's the only one 
with middle-aged sex appeal), and she woos her man back from his affair with a 
younger woman. To his credit, social historian Birmingham manages to infuse 
this fantastic tale with just enough history to give it substance. Credible 
frippery: the perfect spring tonic. 
</P>
<P>
Research is what sets Jacqueline Briskin's The Naked Heart apart from some 
World War II fiction. (There may be a million stories in the naked city, but 
there seems to be twice that many in World War II; has someone designed a 
computer software program where you just plug the details into the basic plot?) 
Briskin went to France to write the story of Gilberte de Permont and her 
American friend Ann Blakely, who meet as girls during the war and whose lives 
are forever intertwined. Gilberte's parents are horribly tortured and killed by 
the Germans, and she disappears, vowing revenge on their captors. Ann, 
determined to find her, enlists the aid of a De Permont family friend -- Quent 
Dejoing, suitably handsome and rich, and destined to marry the wrong girl 
first. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, they all learn something about the betrayal of Gilberte's 
parents that they would rather not know -- something that spans decades and 
countries before it's sorted out. "The Naked Heart" is a dream come true for 
some lucky miniseries location scout and costume designer. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of miniseries, Frederick Forsyth, that dependable purveyor of the 
international thriller, is back with The Negotiator, clearly a candidate for 
inter-media transmogrification. Quinn is an alienated hostage negotiations 
expert, in self-imposed exile in southern Spain after seeing one too many 
people die, who is called back to service to negotiate with the men who have 
kidnaped the President of the United States' son. The hapless kid, a student at 
Oxford, got yanked into a van on his morning run, a pawn in a plot to 
commandeer some of the Middle East's oil supply. 
</P>
<P>
Still with me? There's also a good-looking lady named Sam, a bad-acting bunch 
of guys stateside, the requisite number of suspicious Russians, and enough fast 
turns to keep the story careening to the very last pages. You probably can't 
try Forsyth for the first time if you're suffering from spring fever; look up 
from the page for a moment to contemplate the greenery and you may have trouble 
finding your way back into his dark landscape. But the faithful can use "The 
Negotiator" as an antidote to horticulturally induced giddiness -- and, with a 
350,000 first printing, the publisher clearly anticipates a lot of repeat 
business.

I am very pleased with John Allyn's positive review of my anthology, "The Best 
Japanese Science Fiction Stories" (Book Review, March 26); however, I found two 
errors worth mentioning: First, the book was not published by W. W. Norton. It 
was published by Dembner Books, a small New York company, and distributed by 
Norton. Second, a quote in the final sentence contains a typo that garbles the 
meaning of the sentence. The quote should read: "These seem like things 
scarcely to be believed, but they all happened." Not "These men like things. . 
. ."

THE CROSSWINDS OF FREEDOM THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT, VOLUME III BY JAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
James MacGregor Burns, Woodrow Wilson Professor of Government, Williams 
College, has been analyzing the U.S. political system in historical perspective 
for 40 years. This volume completes his effort to clothe fully his themes. As 
were the other two books in this series, "The Vineyard of Liberty" and "The 
Workshop of Democracy," this one is well written and attentive to economic, 
social and cultural developments. Burns writes clearly and provides a logical 
structure, effectively bridging the various elements of his tale. He has also 
provided copious notes to guide the interested reader to the more specialized 
works on which he has drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Although he tells his story well, Burns is not content with simple narrative. 
Periodically, he offers thoughtful commentary, posing key historical questions 
and reviewing the plausible answers of other historians. He does not, however, 
provide new answers or insights. And leadership, his leitmotif, though giving 
him broad scope to do what he does best -- analyze the vagaries of political 
figures -- constantly begs several questions. 
</P>
<P>
In these volumes, Burns repeats the themes of the other books he has written. 
In "The Deadlock of Democracy" (1963), he argued that the United States was 
saddled with a devitalized and delaying set of political institutions. 
"Leadership" (1978) was an attempt to give substance to that concept as a means 
of guiding people away from their acceptance of mediocre and irresponsible 
leaders. These arguments merged in "The Power to Lead" (1984), in which Burns 
argues that leadership failure is rooted in two institutional problems -- the 
Constitution's separation of powers system and the political party system. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, U.S. political culture produces "transactional" rather than 
"transformational" leaders. The former operate on a task-to-task, deal-making 
agenda; the latter proceed from a base of moral principles. The 
transformational leaders that Burns identifies are notable for their 
limitations. For example, he deeply admires Eleanor Roosevelt, who, but for 
being a woman, could have been the one 20th-Century Democrat to bridge the 
various divides in the party and offer it the quality of moral leadership that 
Burns believes has been absent. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights activists of the '60s also earn his approbation: They took 
"moral and political leadership of the nation," and for "a few brief shining 
years . . . spurred the conscience of their fellow Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Burns appreciates the moral leadership exhibited by the Catholic 
bishops in two Pastoral Letters. The 1983 letter, "The Challenge of Peace," 
elevated "the moral tone and urgency of the nuclear issue." Their 1984 letter, 
on the economy, "magnificently filled the gap between high moral principle and 
explicit economic policy." (As of this writing, it might be noted, the bishops, 
as a body, have been silent on the Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence on 
Salman Rushdie.) 
</P>
<P>
These exemplars, however, are isolated blooms on a generally arid political and 
intellectual plain. Burns does not single out any villains. His negative 
commentary tends to focus on generic villainous types, for example, those who 
have allowed the doctrine of individualism, "one to shrivel into hardly more 
than a slogan for naked class interest and selfish privatization." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, these books contain the account of a people's descent from the Mount 
Sinai of the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787 to the desert 
wandering of current "intellectual disarray." The Founding Fathers, highly 
praised for their enlightened effort to create a set of governing institutions 
that would not threaten their concepts of liberty and equality, ended up 
dividing governing authority so effectively, Burns claims, that nothing has 
emerged to bridge the gaps between the various branches and levels of 
government or between constitutional values and business corporations. As a 
result, he says, leaders and citizens of the United States have lacked the 
wherewithal to give substance to the ideas of liberty and equality. They have 
not, that is, learned how to make a representative republic responsive to the 
"transcending needs and aspirations of the people." 
</P>
<P>
According to Burns, the problem and the solution are one and the same: 
leadership. But we do not learn from Burns exactly why leaders fail or where 
better, more ideal ones will come from. They cannot, he concludes, emerge 
without the propulsive force of committed followers. But, he continues, "such 
leadership, such followership, can be founded only on intellectual and moral 
commitment to values and principles, to ideology in the true sense of the 
word." However, his 1,800 pages have fairly swept the ground clean of promising 
foundations for enduring intellectual and moral commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a crippling contradiction in his historical approach. The 
heretofore unmatched genius of the Founding Fathers produced a political system 
that began to unravel during Washington's first term. A better system, based on 
Jefferson's "majority rule and responsible parties," also did not last long. 
What, then, can we expect of modern man, bereft of the idealistic and 
intellectual qualities of the Founders, bereft also of their unique laboratory 
for experimenting? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one puts down this last volume convinced that Burns, consciously or 
not, harbors a belief that there is an original sin at the heart of the 
republican state-building process that dooms it to failure in terms of 
fulfilling its spoken ideals.

"Grazia: How can you be a Dowell and be so free of despair?," Steve writes to 
his first cousin and fiance Grace Dowell, the novel's narrator. "An optimistic 
Dowell . . . is not natural." 
</P>
<P>
The Dowell clan is indisputably an eccentric lot. Grace's great-aunt Sybil may 
be certifiably mad, and Grace's older cousin Steve -- handsome, possibly 
brilliant, and definitely impenetrable -- is pretentious and unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Grace, a bright, well-adjusted 19-year-old, has been in love with Steve since 
age 3. Now her aunt Sybil and a fortuneteller named Fleesha the Futurist are 
warning her to break loose from a "Disastrous Attachment." 
</P>
<P>
And, when Grace discovers a mysterious connection between Steve and the suicide 
of a newly married second cousin, she becomes "the bride who ran away." 
</P>
<P>
A friend from childhood, David "Duke" McCracken, himself has reasons to flee 
after witnessing a crime implicating his older brothers. So the fugitive and 
the runaway stumble from truck stops to casinos in Reno to low-grade diners, 
always just one step ahead of the law. 
</P>
<P>
A tale both merry and sad of innocence lost and personal declarations of 
independence.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE HAWK'S NEST INCIDENT AMERICA'S WORST INDUSTRIAL 
DISASTER BY MARTIN CHERNIACK MD; FOREWORD BY PHILIP J. LANDRIGAN MD AND ANTHONY 
ROBBINS MD (YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $10.95)

<TEXT>
<P>
During the years of the Great Depression, a marvel of civil engineering 
comprising a dam, tunnel, power station and plant, was erected in the hills of 
West Virginia. For years, Union Carbide boasted "that the Hawk's Nest 
hydroelectric plant could illuminate the entire city of Charleston." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the untold story of this monumental achievement is the cost in human lives: 
By conservative estimates, more than 750 workers, mostly migrants and mostly 
blacks, died from acute silicosis, an occupational, inhalant-induced lung 
disease, in the construction of the great three-mile-long Hawk's Nest Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths caused by silicosis may well have been higher, Martin 
Cherniack posits: Workers would have been evicted from the camps when they were 
no longer able to work. Cherniack, a physician and former researcher at the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has reconstructed this 
epidemiological tragedy of 50 years past from courthouse archives of the lives, 
deaths, grievances and physicians' reports as well as from interviews with 
those who worked in the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such handicaps as physicians' misdiagnoses of the condition and Union 
Carbide's crucial deletions of documents "related to work on the tunnel, 
allegations of silicosis, or the hundreds of legal actions that were brought on 
behalf of former workers," Cherniack has worthily retrieved from historical 
oblivion a major disaster in the history of industrial health.

Also on Wednesday, the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council and Hutton 
Development Co. will give local business and community leaders a presentation 
on DNA identification, an increasingly popular new field of forensic research. 
The Sheriff's Department hopes to raise about $200,000 to establish a DNA 
identification laboratory in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The technique allows detectives to identify criminals from minute pieces of 
physical evidence gathered at the crime scene, including skin, hair or body 
fluids. By comparing these samples with the DNA makeup of samples taken from 
crime suspects, authorities can make a positive identification accepted by the 
court.

IN 8TH GRADE, THE COURSE TO COLLEGE MUST BE CHARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Tom Gorman is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our son, Paul, is 13: fluctuating between wanting to play "fort" with friends 
in the back yard and wanting quiet time to himself; in transition from "The 
Hardy Boys" to Michael Crichton's "Sphere;" and drawn both to "Micro-Machines" 
collector toys and the DOS-prompt of a home computer. The idea of driving a car 
unnerves him, but still he jumps at the chance to back the car out of the 
garage so he can get to the lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
He's in eighth grade, which to me was nothing more than a springboard to the 
serious regimen of high school. In high school, we told him, he would have to 
buckle down, do the best he could and set his sights on college. Junior high, 
we said, is his last bastion of childhood. Enjoy it, kid. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out, though, that a student's future in college may well be determined 
by the end of the eighth grade, and we were almost asleep at the switch. 
</P>
<P>
We are preparing this week to register Paul for his classes at San Pasqual High 
School. And, by definition, that means not just for his freshman year. In fact, 
we will have to determine, in theme and direction, virtually all his high 
school classes, which, in turn, will set the stage for college. There's more 
involved than deciding if he wants wood shop, metal shop or photo I. 
</P>
<P>
The other night was high school orientation for parents, and this being our 
first time through the process, we found we aged four years in one evening. 
</P>
<P>
The counselors gave their spiels: push your kid, challenge your kid, but don't 
put too much stress on him. So what's the clue, Mr. Counselor, a 
red-yellow-green light atop his head? 
</P>
<P>
The counselors told us what was required of our children to graduate no-frills 
from high school. Then they outlined the prerequisites if our child aspires to 
go to a state university, like San Diego State or, maybe eventually, Cal State 
San Marcos. Interested in the UC system? Well, you'll need different classes 
still. A private, top-flight school? Hmmm, let's talk afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
So the game board is something like this: 
</P>
<P>
If he wants to go to San Diego State, he needs -- among other things -- two 
years of science, two years of a foreign language and a year of "fine arts," 
such as drama, photography or music. The state universities, we're told, want 
well-rounded students. 
</P>
<P>
The UC system also requires two years of science -- including a lab science in 
the 10th, 11th or 12th grade. But the school suggests we take at least two 
years of lab science. And, if our child has any hope of getting the UC campus 
of his choice, he had better take four years of lab sciences, and get A's to 
boot. UC also wants a minimum two years of foreign language; the high school 
counselors suggest four. (The choices are French, German and Spanish and, 
living in San Diego, the choice seems obvious. Will Japanese one day be 
offered?) 
</P>
<P>
There are only so many opportunities for "electives," which I remember as one 
of the few chances in high school to kick back and have fun, pursuing a class 
for the pure pleasure of it. In fact, if we prime our son for UC, he's only got 
three electives to play with, what with all the sciences and foreign languages 
he'll be taking. 
</P>
<P>
But what if he decides he might, just might, want to go to San Diego State? He 
needs a year of fine arts. So, to cover our bases, we'll plug in two semesters 
of, say, photography or ceramics into his three semesters of electives. Now 
he's got one semester of elective flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
He loves computers, but intro to computers, which the counselors say is a great 
class and virtually a "must," is a yearlong course. Won't fit. Hey, driver's 
education is not required for graduation. I can teach him how to drive at home 
so he can pick up another elective semester in 10th grade and get his computer 
class. But wait! Driver's ed gives us a break on car insurance. Driver's ed is 
in, computers are out. 
</P>
<P>
Still, intro to computers will fit if he drops one of his four sciences -- and 
that means he might not get the UC campus of his choice. OK, so we put him on a 
four-year track to get him into San Diego State, and at age 13 he's already 
precluded from some post-secondary opportunities. He'll plan just two years of 
a foreign language, throw in a intro-to-computer class and a computer-assisted 
drafting class! Oops, the computer drafting class requires two semesters of 
drafting first. No room. 
</P>
<P>
Let's complicate matters. To qualify for either the UC or state university 
system, each English, math, science and history-civics class he takes must be 
college prep. No problem, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Paul's English teacher at Del Dios Middle School, who is giving him a B, 
recommends that Paul take a "general" English class, versus college-prep. This, 
despite her own evaluation to his high school counselors that says Paul is a 
"good student!" who is above average in his attitude and study habits. She says 
we shouldn't push our son too hard, because he's such a nice boy. 
</P>
<P>
Fine, lady, but if he takes even one semester of "general" English, he won't 
qualify for either UC or San Diego State, because it ain't college-prep 
English. And we wouldn't even be able to correct the error, since college-prep 
English is not offered in summer school. So now we have a situation where, 
because Paul's eighth-grade English teacher doesn't think our son should be 
pushed, she has decided Paul isn't qualified to go directly from high school to 
San Diego State. Hey lady, he's only 13! 
</P>
<P>
Is all lost already? 
</P>
<P>
We will write a letter to Paul's high school counselors to overturn her 
recommendation. We want to make sure Paul doesn't have any higher education 
opportunities shut down, at least not before he's even graduated from eighth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
There's the possibility, of course, that Paul won't want to go to UC or San 
Diego State. He might want to go to Palomar Community College, flesh out his 
academic areas of interest, then make his move to either a trade school or 
university of his choice, once he has better defined his future hopes and 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, gee. If we make that decision now, he can skip the foreign languages 
altogether, take just two years of science, and take a whole bunch of electives 
-- computers and drafting and photography and speech and oceanography and 
agricultural science and landscaping and journalism. He'd be the most 
well-rounded kid of all in four years -- but not qualified for a four-year 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Paul is dealing with all this reasonably well. We think he will follow whatever 
course we set him on, and we've got a week to talk it out, second-guess 
ourselves and make our decision. We're looking at the options, the costs, the 
pressures, the academic interests, his future potential. Our 13-year-old, 
meanwhile, is wondering how to improve the fort in the back yard and where he 
can snag another piece of plywood.

POLICE PERSUADE BEATING SUSPECT TO SURRENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cypress police and a man they suspected of beating his wife negotiated for 6 
hours before the man came out of his house and surrendered early Saturday 
morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Kevin William Yearout, 20, of Cypress, was jailed on suspicion of 
assault, police said. His bail was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Police were summoned after Yearout's wife ran to a neighbor's house a little 
after 11 p.m. Friday. She told officers that Yearout had "numerous weapons" in 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
It took police until about 5 a.m. to persuade Yearout to surrender. Officers 
said they searched the house and found no weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Yearout's wife was treated for minor injuries, police said.

NEARLY 3,000 HIGH SCHOOL JOURNALISTS MEET IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 high school students attending a national journalism convention 
were exposed to the business of gathering, writing and publishing the news 
Saturday in Anaheim during the 1989 Journalism Education Assn. convention. 
</P>
<P>
The convention drew fledgling journalists from 28 states across the country and 
packed the halls and seminar rooms of the Anaheim Marriott hotel. The 
convention, which opened Friday with a keynote address by former Kansas City TV 
anchor Cristine Craft and which closes today, offered the young writers 
glimpses into such subjects as news writing, developing sources, using public 
records and conducting investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to impart to these kids the importance of service-to-reader," said 
Alison Rittger, a convention spokeswoman. "And, that the service they give 
should be done in as ethical and professional manner as is possible. If we do 
this, then we will have done our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Rittger said that the delegates, all 14 to 18 years old, also attended a 
mini-journalism trade show that featured booths by various media companies, 
universities and publishing firms. Another event was the student write-offs, 
where about 1,500 of the delegates competed in 17 news, feature and sports 
writing competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for the exchange of ideas among the delegates is an important 
function of the convention, Rittger said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous opportunity for both the kids and their advisers to 
network and exchange ideas. They will take these ideas back home and put them 
to good use on their own newspapers," Rittger said. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Wackowski, 17, of Fresno, said, "I love the idea of a career in journalism 
because I am very curious, and I like the idea that I won't be in the same 
place at the same time" every day. 
</P>
<P>
Wackowski said that she was undaunted by the low starting salaries that often 
accompany a career in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, I'd rather be happier being a reporter than be rich and hate my job," 
Wackowski said. 
</P>
<P>
For Oregon delegate Randi Cartmill, 18, the prospect of a career in journalism 
was a little daunting for the teen-ager who works on her high school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper I work on back home is stressful enough. I'm not sure that I 
would want to do this the rest of my life. But for now, the satisfaction comes 
from seeing it all come together into a package that people can understand and 
enjoy," Cartmill said.

IT'S TIME TO BAN GILL NETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a year and a half ago, the Legislature, responding to the mounting deaths 
of sea mammals and marine birds caught in the narrowly woven plastic gill nets 
used by commercial fishermen, banned the use of the deadly nets along the 
Central California coast. They had already been banned in Northern California 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
It is now time to extend that ban and eliminate gill-net fishing along the 
entire California coastline. 
</P>
<P>
A bill (AB 1) introduced by Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) would do that 
by creating a Marine Resource Protection Zone from the shoreline 3 miles out to 
sea in an area running from Point Arguello above Santa Barbara down coast to 
the Mexican Border. It would also include some waters around the Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, scheduled for a hearing Tuesday before the Assembly's Water, Parks 
and Wildlife Committee, should be passed by the Legislature and signed into law 
by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The problems caused by the use of gill nets by commercial fishermen is no 
different off the Orange County coastline than it is anywhere else along the 
western United States and Canada, where similar bans are now in force 
protecting sea life. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, scores of sea lions, some badly mutilated from their 
horrible ordeal of struggling to free themselves from the deadly nets, washed 
ashore on the Orange County shoreline between Seal Beach and Huntington Beach. 
Three more dead sea lions turned up at Sunset Beach last Wednesday. That raises 
the toll to more than 70 this year in that short stretch of county coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The state reports that in the 1986-87 fishing year, more than 6,500 sea lions, 
harbor seals and porpoises were killed in the nets that also pose a deadly 
hazard to whales, dolphins and fish that are caught and die needlessly because 
more than 70% of what the nets trap and kill are of no use to the commercial 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's bill is a fair one that will save valuable marine life from unnecessary 
and painful death and provide commercial fishermen with capital investment to 
purchase alternate fishing gear that is less destructive to the ocean's 
environment and life chain. The money will come from the sale of a $3 stamp to 
saltwater fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Economically and environmentally, AB 1 makes good sense. The state policy has 
been a conservative one that dealt with gill-net bans case by case and area by 
area whenever specific sea mammal and bird species were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that sea life and the sportfishing industry in Southern California 
were given the same protection from gill nets that the Legislature has provided 
for the rest of the California coastline.

WHEN UNCAPPED PENS DISGURGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERE WITTER, Jere Witter is a free-lance writer in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most reporters in the sunset of their careers have prize-winning stories framed 
on the wall and a shrine full of trophies and awards. I have, instead, the 
largest private collection of dust rags in Southern California. They pop out of 
drawers, spill out of cupboards, lie tucked behind furniture and one is wrapped 
around an oil pump in the back of my car. Their replacement value could be 
estimated at $3,999.95. 
</P>
<P>
These dust rags were imported from L.A. Bean or bought in job lots from J.C. 
Penney. Several are from Brooks Brothers. One comes from a tony shop on Rodeo 
Drive and another was made to my measure by the most expensive men's furnisher 
on Rue St. Honore. It has French cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
By now, only lip movers have failed to guess that these dust rags once passed 
for wearing apparel. More exactly, dress shirts into whose breast pocket a 
felt-tip pen has been plunged point-down and left to leak. They all bear 
indelible dark splotches which -- if bright red -- would suggest the wearer had 
been daggered to death. As it is, all they prove is that he is stupid and 
forgetful. Soaking in water merely widens the stain; most laundries will send 
it back with a note of apology. The only thing left to do is cut the buttons 
off the shirt and turn it into a dust rag. 
</P>
<P>
The ink-blotch dilemma is shared more widely than you suspect. One senior 
editor on an Orange County daily wears a vest in the hottest weather because he 
has ruined every shirt he has. And not only the ink-stained wretches of 
journalism are left wretchedly ink-stained. Customers keep a tailor in 
Huntington Beach fairly busy removing breast pockets, folding under the bottom 
and lowering them to hide the stain. This costs $7 and leaves you with a short 
pocket but less subject to public ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
Other remedies are at hand, none with much appeal. One is to use a pencil 
instead of a pen, but pencils are for people who make mistakes. Another is to 
carry the pen in your pants pocket, which means you ruin $60 slacks instead of 
a $20 shirt. You can wear a black shirt but you might get mistaken for a Black 
Shirt. And around City Hall, you see those protective holsters that fit into 
shirt pockets and carry a dozen pens; they are OK if you want to get jailed for 
impersonating a building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
A measure of self-discipline is imposed when you come across a shirt so 
all-fired handsome that you want to be buried in it and wear it only on 
occasions of state, like Fridays. My all-time favorite shirt is a striped 
number by Calvin Klein. My mother says it makes me look like an Englishman, 
which is her idea of a put-down. I prefer to think that it gives me the 
super-achieving savoir-faire of a junk-bond salesman, and I would no sooner 
deface it than desecrate the Mona Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
I wore the shirt for nearly a year with sinful pride, fending off appeals for 
inside tips on the market and living in a kind of fool's paradise, then looked 
down one recent day to see that a capless Magic Marker had disgurgled its 
contents into the bosom of this fashion statement. The shirt and its dreadful 
Rorschach blot was rushed to the emergency room of a newly opened laundry. The 
attendant there said to make use of a staple common in every household. 
</P>
<P>
"Hair spray!" I yelled, running my fingers through a luxuriant forelock that 
disappeared 20 years ago, "What would I be doing with hair spray?" 
</P>
<P>
She explained (as if to a child) that if I sprayed hair spray on the ink blot, 
it would go away. "Any kind will do," she added, "It takes off lipstick marks 
too." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get that lucky," I growled, and ran off to shoplift a $1.48 squeeze 
bottle of Clairol Hold-All Conditioner. One accurate squeeze and the ink-stain 
floated off like a bad dream. My favorite shirt was not only clean but 
conditioned! I'd go on about this, but I'm too busy cleaning and conditioning 
this pile of dust rags and sewing the buttons back on. With all that finery, a 
guy could pick up a lipstick mark.

ASSESSING THE RISKS TO THOSE NEAR THE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to William M. Monroe's view on noise abatement (April 
9). First of all, let me say on behalf of most pilots that we try to follow 
noise abatement procedures when we fly. However, when most of us do fly, we 
think of flying the airplane first. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine an airliner loaded to capacity taking off at airports with relatively 
short runways -- like those at John Wayne Airport. The captain doesn't like to 
reduce power just for noise because that would reduce performance, especially 
in an emergency, but he does. 
</P>
<P>
In Airline Safety, Capt. William Heller suggested that the DC-10 crash at 
Chicago could probably have been avoided. The DC-10, in his view, probably 
could still have flown, even though the engine fell off, but the airplane was 
following procedures dictated by noise abatement requirements and that 
suggested that the airplane did not have the extra airspeed required to 
maintain flight. 
</P>
<P>
I think we should have pity for the captain and his crew whenever you see them 
flying from airports like John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing people don't understand is that they complain about noisy jets 
flying over certain noise-sensitive areas. Most jets, definitely airliners, 
operate under instrument flight rules. Under the rules, a plane is under the 
control of air traffic controllers, so it's not always up to the pilots where 
they fly. During congested periods, a controller will use all available 
airspace so that planes don't collide. 
</P>
<P>
In closing, I just like to say that many old pictures of airports don't show 
homes around them. That should speak for itself. Also I didn't go to Playa del 
Rey like Mr. Monroe suggested, instead I went to a little hill just south of 
LAX. I must say I love to hear and watch jumbos take off and land.

ARTICLE ABOUT PROTESTS HELD ON ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thought that reporters were supposed to be dispassionate and fair. The 
article "Tustin Denies 2 Anti-Abortion Bids" (April 4) states that "thousands 
of anti-abortion demonstrators . . . and large numbers of pro-choice 
demonstrators went head-to-head at family planning clinics across the 
Southland." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the anti-abortionists were not able to muster more than 500 people on 
weekdays or 800 on the weekend. Pro-choice people (defending 90 clinics and 
having to disperse their people over a wide area) equaled or outnumbered the 
anti-abortionists at every clinic that was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I have never read the names (with towns) of landlords so carefully listed 
in a newspaper when the landlords had not been negligent -- in any way -- of 
their property or the law. Does your reporter believe that leasing property to 
a family-planning clinic is a crime? If not, why is he inviting harassment of 
these innocent people?

ASSESSING THE RISKS TO THOSE NEAR THE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The airplane crash in Eastbluff that wiped out a young Canadian family was 
statistically inevitable. Equally inevitable is a crash of a large commercial 
jet in our city. It will happen out of John Wayne Airport, the fifth-busiest 
airport in the nation. Doubling the number of commercial flights out of John 
Wayne next year also doubles the chances of a major jet crash in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The crash site of a commercial jet airliner will not be confined to an area 
only the size of two tennis courts. Residents of Newport Beach were very 
fortunate there were not lives on the ground lost this time. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to expand a tiny general aviation airport to a commercial facility 
in a highly populated area was irresponsible to begin with. There were open, 
unpopulated areas of Orange County at the time, but it would have been more 
expensive to build a remote airport, access roads needed to be built, etc. To 
double commercial flights next year out of John Wayne is additionally 
irresponsible. To continue to route aircraft over the most densely populated 
areas of Newport Beach is patently inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
I have a large file consisting of letters written by residents of Eastbluff, 
Sea Island, Irvine Terrace, Balboa Island and Balboa Peninsula to the city of 
Newport Beach, Orange County, the Federation Aviation Administration and our 
state senator. We have a petition signed by almost 3,000 residents demanding 
that the dangerous route and takeoff procedures be reexamined. 
</P>
<P>
The deep power cutback one nautical mile after takeoff is outdated with the new 
Stage 3 aircraft now departing John Wayne and, according to a recent study 
funded by the city of Newport Beach, actually causes more noise by keeping 
commercial aircraft low over Newport Beach. More importantly, it severely 
decreases the pilots' emergency power in case of engine failure, thus 
increasing the risk of a crash. 
</P>
<P>
The outdated takeoff procedures also call for a turn to the left over the upper 
bay, routing aircraft toward Eastbluff. This routes commercial jets in front of 
small aircraft departing the shorter runway to their left. The current 
procedure then routes the commercial jets over the most populated areas of 
Newport Beach! All dangerous, unnecessary, outdated procedures. 
</P>
<P>
I perceive Newport citizens as intelligent and politically sophisticated, and 
it amazes me that we have allowed and continue to allow the county to dump the 
entire burden of Orange County's air traffic on our city. The noise, pollution 
and congestion caused by John Wayne is intolerable enough. This burden should 
not be allowed to extend to endangering our lives unnecessarily by specifically 
routing aircraft over our homes, schools and families. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne is growing faster than the national average for airport growth. The 
prospect of a second airport in Orange County is looking less likely. Even if a 
second airport site is found, John Wayne will remain in full operation. 
</P>
<P>
Will Newport Beach have to wait for a disaster the magnitude of Cerritos to 
happen before the city, county and FAA enact safer takeoff procedures and 
routes?

PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer's recent letter incorrectly characterized 
"mainstream, professional psychology" as viewing homosexuality "as an acquired 
behavior and even 'perverse' in the clinical sense." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of homosexuality being an acquired behavior, research indicates 
that sexual orientation develops at a very early age, perhaps by the age of 6 
and certainly by early adolescence. Contrary to Dannemeyer's characterization, 
no consensus about causation has emerged among psychologists. Furthermore, once 
established, homosexual orientation is highly resistant to attempts to change 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances -- where sexual orientation is acquired at a very early 
age and subsequent attempts to change are unsuccessful -- it makes little sense 
to argue that homosexual behavior is a choice. On the issue of homosexuality 
being " 'perverse' in the clinical sense," by 1973 accumulated research 
findings from studies comparing homosexuals to heterosexuals on measures of 
psychological adjustment and mental health consistently revealed that there was 
no justification for homosexuality to be labeled a mental disorder. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the basis of the scientific research and clinical experience of its 
members that the American Psychological Assn. stated in 1975 that 
"homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, 
reliability, or general social and vocational capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
When access to human and civil rights is involved, discrimination on the basis 
of stereotypes must not be tolerated by our society. The American Psychological 
Assn. is proud of its history of opposition to such discrimination and will 
continue to support protections for the rights of racial, ethnic and religious 
minorities, women, people with disabilities, children and the elderly, and for 
gay men and lesbians.

TRAFFIC SITUATION IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe that there are some people driving around in Orange County who 
shouldn't have a license. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic has grown tremendously all over Orange County. Coming home on the 
freeway, or even the side streets, is almost like a nightmare. No one drives 
the speed limit any more. No one uses signals when turning or changing lanes. 
And people are always driving into the bike lane before they plan to turn. And 
people wonder why there are so many accidents. 
</P>
<P>
If everyone just learned to be patient and accept the traffic, there would 
probably be less-stressful people and accidents. Leave a little earlier. Don't 
speed and jeopardize others because you're running late. Be cautious, use your 
signals correctly, and stay out of the bike lane. Just be courteous to other 
drivers because the streets are just as much theirs as yours.

<P>
PERSISTENCE, AND THEN SOME, TAKES TITANS' STATON TO BRINK OF PRO CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the age of 15 he signed his life away -- acknowledging on the medical waiver 
that he was playing baseball against doctors' advice and that if he died only 
his devotion to the game could be blamed. 
</P>
<P>
When it came time for him to choose a college, he chose, only to find out the 
college didn't want him so much anymore, which meant a nearly unbearable year 
and a half of practicing baseball but not playing it. 
</P>
<P>
When he thought it was time to turn pro, having just completed one of the 
greatest summers any college hitter has ever had, the pros made an offer so 
measly that the attending scout refused to reveal it to him because he thought 
the offer "insulting." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Staton is a jilted lover. From the time he was 3, playing catch with his 
father, Bob, he has been true to baseball. By the time he was at Tustin High 
School, he knew it was what he wanted to do with his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't imagine doing anything else." 
</P>
<P>
But every step of the way his affections have gone unrequited. Baseball has 
always managed to leave him up in the air, dancing on the edge or shaking his 
head. There have been the broken promises, the half-hearted looks of scouts and 
recruiters, a bout with the disease lupus and the doubts about his talent. 
</P>
<P>
"David has never had it easy," said Orange Coast College baseball coach Mike 
Mayne, who coached Staton in 1986 and 1987. "You tell kids if they work hard 
and sacrifice, something good will come of it. But that didn't happen for 
David. At least, not for a while. He always seemed to get the short end, he 
always got caught in the middle of something he didn't deserve." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. Staton, Cal State Fullerton's designated hitter and leading 
candidate for hard-luck poster boy, is leading his team in home runs (14) and 
RBIs (53) and is hitting .381 Suddenly, a guy who couldn't catch a break has 
broken onto the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see no reason why Dave won't be hitting 30 homers a year in the major 
leagues someday," said scout Joe L. Brown, who has been with the Pittsburgh 
Pirate organization for 40 years, including 25 years as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Staton, who is 6-feet-5 and 220 pounds, is first and foremost a power hitter, 
with the kind of power that reminds Brown of, "a young Dick Stuart." Stuart hit 
228 home runs in 10 major league seasons, including 42 in 1963 with the Boston 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Staton was always big for his age. In second grade at Tustin's Helen Estock 
Elementary School, he turned away near-daily challenges to his honor, which 
kept his pride intact but did less to endear him to the school's staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of citizenship problems at that time," Staton said. 
</P>
<P>
He rarely played with kids his own age, his size and skills always forcing him 
into the older leagues. The first year he tried out for Little League, at the 
age of 8, he was placed in a league with 11- and 12-year-olds because, as his 
father, Bob, explains, "if he played with 8-year-olds he'd probably hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
The Senior Little League season before his first year of high school, Staton 
hit .800. He entered high school and played football, basketball and baseball. 
Sports had always been at the center of his existence -- "David lived for 
sports," Bob said. In his sophomore year, he played football and basketball, 
but noticed after the end of basketball season an unusual soreness in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
Chalking it up to the wear and tear of the hardwood he set out for baseball, 
but the soreness got worse. Two weeks later he couldn't walk without crutches. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably the scariest point in my life," Staton said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors ran tests and came up with nothing. Finally they injected dye into his 
legs and discovered blood clots. They diagnosed that the clots were caused by a 
disease called lupus. 
</P>
<P>
Lupus is a form of arthritis that inflames the body's connective tissues and 
causes the immune system to produce antibodies that, instead of fighting off 
bacteria and virus, attack the body. 
</P>
<P>
It took doctors awhile to diagnose the disease because, though 500,000 
Americans are estimated to have lupus -- more than 90% of them are women, 
according to the Lupus Chapter of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Once diagnosed, doctors told Staton that football and basketball, and any other 
contact sport, were out. They were concerned that any jarring could move the 
clots from his legs to his lungs or brain and cause serious injury or perhaps 
death. 
</P>
<P>
They also recommended that he not play baseball, worried of the same tragic 
result if he were hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
When he made the decision to play -- "My love of the game just outweighed the 
dangers" -- his parents supported him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't live your life in a glass cage," Bob said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave signed a medical waiver releasing the school and doctors from 
responsibility if the worst happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I look back, that was a pretty big step for a 15-year-old kid to be 
making," Staton said. "But, if I was faced with the decision again, I know I'd 
do the same thing. I wouldn't blink." 
</P>
<P>
Staton took medication for lupus for three years and the disease has been 
diagnosed as being in remission. 
</P>
<P>
In his senior year at Tustin, he hit .525 with eight home runs and was 
recruited to Orange Coast College. After two all-state seasons with the bat -- 
he hit .420 and 370, and ended up with 17 home runs and 99 RBIs -- he accepted 
a scholarship offer from Larry Cochell, then the baseball coach at 
Northwestern. He chose Northwestern because it was away from California -- "I 
always thought that when you go to college, you should go away to college" -- 
and because of its nationally recognized journalism department. 
</P>
<P>
As a kid he taped Kings' hockey games from the radio and practiced doing 
play-by-play. He played Chick Hearn to a friend's Keith Erickson while sitting 
in the Tustin dugout during games. He wanted to go into either broadcast or 
print journalism after putting in 20 years of major league service and carving 
out a little place of his own in Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Kids do dream. But when Cochell left Northwestern to take the Cal State 
Fullerton job, which opened when Augie Garrido went to Illinois, it was 
nightmare time. With Cochell gone, the offer to Staton went from a three-year 
full-ride to two years at half tuition. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming home, I just thought I had blown it," Staton said. Mayne suggested that 
he enroll at Orange Coast for classes and work out with the OCC baseball team, 
which he did. 
</P>
<P>
But, though he worked out with the team, he wasn't part of a team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne tried to get scouts and recruiters to take a look at Staton, but few 
seemed interested. He had been out of baseball for a year and a half. Though he 
had power, some questioned his ability to hit, even though he had never hit 
below .350 in any organized league since he was 8. And then there was the 
one-dimensional tag that stuck to him like a paste pot. 
</P>
<P>
Staton's best position is first base. But he got to Orange Coast at the same 
time as Rex Peters, an outstanding defensive first baseman. Peters played in 
the field, Staton was the DH. 
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with Dave's skills," Mayne said. "Rex is just a 
once-in-a-lifetime defensive player. Any other year, Dave would have played 
first. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough convincing people just to look at him. People looked at him as a 
one-dimensional player." 
</P>
<P>
Then Joe L. Brown took a look and liked what he saw. He convinced the Pirates 
to draft him and told his son, Ty, about him. Ty was then general manager of a 
team in Brewster, Mass., that was a member of the Cape Cod League, one of the 
oldest and most prestigious college summer leagues. Ty put Staton on his team 
for the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Through the many disappointments and scary moments, Staton had managed to keep 
his game face, but as he waited to go East, he was very nervous. A little more 
than two months before the league was to start, he broke his right hand. He 
could only start hitting 2 1/2 weeks before he was scheduled to go to 
Massachusetts. Another thing bothered him; the Cape Cod League used only wood 
bats, and he had never batted with a wood bat in a regulation game. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that was the fact that he hadn't played a real game in a year and a 
half. His worst fears seemed confirmed in a scrimmage before the first day of 
the season when he made two errors on the first two balls hit to him at third 
base. He struck out his two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death before that first game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He doubled in his first at-bat, and he went five for five that day with two 
home runs. That season he set a league record for home runs with 16. He also 
led the league in RBIs with 48 and his .358 batting average came within two 
points of winning him the triple crown, a feat never accomplished in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"They were calling me Secretariat, but I really wasn't aware of what I was 
doing," said Staton, who was named the league's most valuable player. "It was 
kind of like I was in a dream and I didn't want anyone to wake me up." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the hearty wake-up slap in the face, though, when the Pirates, who 
had drafted him on Brown's recommendation, offered him nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe told me he didn't want to embarrass me with the figures," Staton said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had waited to see what Staton would do in the Cape Cod League until 
they made their offer. Considering his season, the offer figured to be 
substantial. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they saw him in a couple of (Cape Cod League) all-star games and they 
weren't as impressed as I had been," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
True, Staton didn't hit a home run in the all-star games, but he hit more than 
.400. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else I could do," Staton said. "When Joe told me, I wanted 
to cry." 
</P>
<P>
Brown told him on a Friday in late summer. It was too late to take any 
recruiting trips. The University of Missouri said they'd take him, but he would 
have to be on a plane that night. Fearing he was at the end of the road, Staton 
remembered that Cochell had promised him in April that he would hold a 
scholarship for him just in case things didn't work out with the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
He flew home and enrolled at Fullerton on the first day of classes. There he 
found Cochell, one man who had kept his word to him, and Rex Peters at first 
base. Cochell likens Peters to Keith Hernandez . . . Staton became the 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start he started hitting home runs. Big home runs. He hit one in a 
game against Florida State that Mike Martin, Florida State coach, said was the 
longest he'd seen in 14 years of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, he hit five homers in two games against UC Santa Barbara. "I 
still can't believe it," Staton said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he's considered a junior as far as his athletic eligibility -- he 
is a senior academically -- this will be Staton's only season at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"David will not be back," Cochell said. "He'll be in the pros." 
</P>
<P>
It appears he'll finally get his due come signing day. Baseball's amateur draft 
is June 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Excited. Ahhh, yeah. 
</P>
<P>
"My personality is the type that I always like being in control," he said. "But 
it seemed like for such a long time my career was always in someone else's 
hands . . . It's great now, because I know that someday my life is going to 
revolve around the game." 
</P>
<P>
As if it hasn't done a few hundred orbits already.

AFTER A LINEUP SHUFFLE, ERROR-FREE GOLDEN WEST BEATS CYPRESS

Golden West College's baseball team was shaken up by Orange Coast last 
Thursday. Golden West Coach Burt Villarreal responded by shaking up his infield 
Saturday, and it helped gain a 5-3 victory over Cypress in an Orange Empire 
Conference baseball game at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West was demolished by OCC, 15-2, Thursday as the Rustlers made four 
infield errors, which led to five unearned runs. After that, Villarreal decided 
to make a few changes. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Bammer was moved from third to first base, shortstop Craig Paquette moved 
to third, Robb Carabba moved from second to short and Mike Willey moved to 
second from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (16-11-1 overall and 10-6 in conference) responded with no errors 
Saturday and is tied with Cypress (24-12, 10-6), a game behind 
conference-leading Rancho Santiago. Rancho Santiago defeated Riverside, 19-2, 
also Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to do something," Villarreal said. "We needed to shake it up a little 
bit and give some people a chance that deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
Golden West starter John Gonzales took a 5-3 lead into the ninth but gave up a 
lead-off double to Ken Kendrena. Cypress' Joey Gonzalez hit a sharp grounder 
between third and short, only to have Paquette dive far to his left, grab the 
ball, get up and throw out Gonzalez by a step. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Tewell hit a much easier grounder to Paquette for the second out, and 
Mitch Kaylor lined out to second baseman Willey for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"I told myself in the last two innings that if anything came my way I was 
getting dirty," said Paquette, who played third last season, but switched to 
shortstop this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales (3-2) allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out two for Golden 
West. Cypress' Jeff Patterson (6-2) pitched seven innings in relief to take the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West took a 2-0 lead in the first inning as Paquette singled and Bammer, 
a freshman from Edison High School, followed with a home run to left, his 
fourth this season. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' Steve Gill walked and later scored by on a single to right by Doug 
Yates as the Chargers cut the lead to 2-1, also in the first. Gill hit his 12th 
home run of the season in the fifth to tie it, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West broke the tie with two runs in the sixth with the help of an error 
by Cypress left fielder Bobby Thome. Steve McKowen was on second with one out 
when Bammer bounced a single over third baseman Brett Gregory's head. McKowen 
stopped at third, but the ball went under Thome's glove and all the way to the 
wall, allowing McKowen to score and Bammer to reach third. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress then played its infield up and Shelby Hart singled up the middle to 
score Bammer. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette walked and later scored on a single by Dan Villegas in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress rallied a bit in its half of the eighth. Gregory had a two-out double 
to score Gill who had singled. But pinch-hitter Mike Neal flied out to center 
with runners on second and third. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 19, Riverside 2 -- Jack Bailey (9-2) pitched seven innings for 
the victory as host Rancho Santiago (22-12, 11-5) had 22 hits. Danny Ontiveros 
and Tim Reynolds had four hits and two RBIs each. 
</P>
<P>
John McTaggart and Marty Neff each hit their eighth home runs of the season for 
Rancho Santiago. Neff had three hits and McTaggart also had a sacrifice fly. 
Riverside falls to 6-21-1, 3-12-1. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 19, Saddleback 4 -- Scott Talanoa hit his conference-leading 14th 
home run in the first inning for visiting Orange Coast (11-6, 24-9-1). Hector 
Santa Cruz had three hits, scored a run, and had four RBIs, Eddie Pierce had 
two hits, scored three runs, and drove in a run for OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kelly had two hits and scored a run for OCC. John Duris (7-1) pitched a 
complete game for the victory. Justin Pysar had three hits including a double 
for Saddleback (13-11-1, 5-8-1). 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach 11, Fullerton 4 -- Tony Osendorf had four hits including a double 
for visiting Fullerton (10-20).

TRANSCENDING REALISM; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG AND GIFTED, ARTIST MEGAN HART JONES LEFT HER MARK IN THE ABSTRACT AND THE 
SPIRITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, when Megan Hart Jones was 20 years old, she painted a portrait of 
herself standing -- like a saint in a medieval altar painting -- against a 
brilliant gold background. It was the last work she completed before she died 
later that year, the victim of a rare form of cancer that invades the adrenal 
glands in the kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
In "Soul Portrait," she seems already to inhabit some unearthly realm, blessing 
the viewer with her right hand and holding a sheaf of tightly budded roses in 
the crook of her left arm. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts devout, private, intelligent, wryly humorous, hard-working and 
dedicated to her art, Jones sounds almost too good to be true. She enjoyed the 
plays of Shakespeare, the music of Mozart and Vivaldi, Tina Turner and the 
Eurythmics. She loved Laura Ashley clothes, the color pink, carnations and 
cherry Coke. She was a loyal friend and a devoted daughter. And she was a 
strikingly gifted realist artist. 
</P>
<P>
A selection of her paintings, drawings and the tiny ceramic sculptures she made 
in her last year is on view at the Ettinger Gallery of the Art Institute of 
Southern California in Laguna Beach through April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The largest group of works in the exhibition are cloud studies, carefully 
worked up in graphite, watercolor or colored pencil. Jones once wrote that 
clouds were "among the least explored subjects (in art). . . . They can be 
represented realistically, yet at the same time appear abstract. Clouds are a 
paradox and an enigma." 
</P>
<P>
But the most compelling pieces in the show are the portraits -- of herself, her 
friends and her mother, Chadlyn Jones -- and the delicate, scrupulously 
rendered still lifes that she conceived of in religious terms that she 
apparently never discussed, even with her closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
Only the tiniest hints of a flesh-and-blood person with problems and doubts and 
rebellions seep through the immaculate picture offered by her mother, friends 
and teachers. But the central fact about her personality seems to have been the 
relentless perfectionism and fierce self-control that drove her to dedicate her 
life to her work and keep its deepest meanings to herself. 
</P>
<P>
A self-portrait as Lady Macbeth from 1985 brings the viewer up short: Why would 
an even-tempered, good-natured young woman choose to portray herself as 
Shakespeare's malevolent heroine, the woman whose ruthlessness drove her 
husband to murder his host and who bloodied her own hands in the murder of 
innocent castle guards? 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier version of the graphite drawing (in which she wears a 
lace-trimmed gown designed by Laura Ashley and a favorite necklace with a 
single pearl), Jones drew a snake emerging from her sleeve. Her mother says she 
asked why this image had been covered up in the final version, and her daughter 
replied, "It's not necessary." But Chadlyn Jones found the passage in "Macbeth" 
(Act I, Scene 5, Line 66) that might make the meaning clearer: 
</P>
<P>
"Look like the innocent flower,/ But be the serpent under 't." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that who you are?" Chadlyn Jones asked her daughter. "No," she replied. "It 
is a dual portrait." The following year, the artist noted in one of her private 
jottings that her idea of a dual portrait was "a representational image of a 
person and the mood or psyche of a fictional character." Perhaps the tension 
she intended to create in the portrait was meant to mirror the basic human 
struggle between good and evil. Perhaps she recognized, even in her own 
high-minded drive to make art, echoes of the relentless, darkly directed forces 
that drove Lady Macbeth. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps -- as some people close to her choose to think -- the portrait was 
no more than a harmless costume drama. But the more one hears about Jones' 
extraordinary introspection, religious devotion and intelligence, the harder 
that is to believe. 
</P>
<P>
"From the moment she was born, I knew why I was on earth," Chadlyn Jones says. 
"She went everywhere with us -- parties, luncheons with me, places where you 
don't take babies." 
</P>
<P>
Her father is artist John Paul Jones, who teaches in the UC Irvine studio art 
department. When their daughter was 9, the Joneses left their airy, ocean-view 
house in Laguna Beach for a 10-month sojourn in Europe, mostly in Madrid, where 
they often visited the Prado to look at the paintings of the Spanish masters. 
Enrolled in a private school, Megan Jones began to write stories and poems for 
her own amusement, which she would continue to do for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Chadlyn Jones says the family was not religious at all and "didn't have a Bible 
in the house," but when her daughter was 12 or 13, she went to a book fair and 
purchased one. Soon thereafter, at Megan Jones request, she was baptized (along 
with her mother) in the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, the Joneses separated. The experience must have been 
traumatic to the adolescent girl, who loved both her parents but whose 
personality -- according to friends -- most resembled her father's. Perhaps 
this was the time that she became the "very private person" her acquaintances 
describe. 
</P>
<P>
Mia Di Sandro -- a former neighbor and peer who had known Megan Jones since she 
was 5 -- agreed that the young woman was troubled by the divorce but refused to 
discuss the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
As a young woman, Di Sandro said, Megan Jones was "very calm and levelheaded 
and very respectful and accepting of other people -- not the type to make a 
judgment. She didn't let people get to her." Yet she was also "a very 
controlled person. She told you what she wanted to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
At 14, Megan Jones began to study drawing evenings and Saturdays at the Laguna 
Beach College of Art (the former name of the Art Institute of Southern 
California). Jonathan Burke, who still teaches there, remembers his "amazement" 
at her "acute observation" and "accurate perception -- how well she could lock 
into form at the beginning. It seemed that (her) style was very natural to her, 
as if she had already made up her mind" about the direction her art would take. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, she developed anorexia nervosa, a psychologically motivated 
aversion to eating that tends to occur in young women. Perversely, she also 
loved to cook; she specialized in desserts, including puff pastry, and also 
liked to make ethnic dishes. To earn money for college, she baked white 
chocolate chip cookies that she sold twice a week at the cafe adjacent to the 
UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
At Smith College, she chose to do a paper on anorexia for her freshman English 
composition class and turned out a beyond-the-call-of-duty 48-page thesis that 
won the college's Maya Yates writing prize. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Akins, her art teacher at Laguna Beach High School, says she was one of the 
"top three or four" of the approximately 15,000 students he has taught in his 
38-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd sit right at the very front desk, about 3 feet from me," he remembers. 
"She was very quiet and introspective. We'd have quiet conversations. We'd 
discuss the philosophical content of her work. She loved to do that. . . . 
There'd be kids screwing around, and she would just work. But she had a fey 
sense of humor. Once in a while, she'd (deliver) a W.C. Fields-style aside to 
me or to her friends." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Akins gives a "fairly structured" class for students in their first 
and second years of high school. But in Megan Jones' freshman year, he says, he 
thought she was "grounded enough to put her in the studio and turn her loose." 
</P>
<P>
Using colored pencils, she liked to draw images from her travels in a 
meticulous style. One scene -- two women in a Spanish grocery store festooned 
with fruits and vegetables -- took her 4 months to complete. She patiently 
applied layer after layer of Prismacolor to create the fine tonal gradations in 
the cloud drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"Her work was very traditional in a lot of respects," Akins says. "It developed 
so slowly that she didn't make many mistakes in proportion." 
</P>
<P>
A mural that Laguna Beach High commissioned from her (it hangs in the 
cafeteria) shows 15 life-size images of students posing with sports equipment, 
musical instruments or books. She once explained that the students are all 
painted in gray because "the shadows of the past should not overwhelm these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Her remark was just one of many tantalizingly mysterious pronouncements that 
she preferred not to explain. Perhaps she meant that the students should not 
feel, in later years, as though their teen-age personalities were upstaging 
them. By painting their teen-age selves in gray, the young artist gave them a 
more muted quality. 
</P>
<P>
While she was still in high school, Megan Jones began to show her work locally. 
It was included in an "Up and Coming" show of young artists at TLK Gallery in 
Costa Mesa and group exhibits at Mills House Art Gallery in Garden Grove, the 
Laguna Beach Museum of Art (as it was then known) and the Irvine Fine Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was her idea to go to Smith College in Northampton, Mass. She was intrigued 
by the prospect of living in snow country. Perhaps she saw a relationship 
between New England and the British Isles, where she felt very much at home. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is one of the Seven Sister schools -- the female version of the Ivy 
League -- and it has a reputation for solid academic standards. Megan Jones, 
who also played the flute and continued to pursue her creative writing, 
considered herself something of a Renaissance woman. In any case, her reserve 
and serious interests were vastly different from the stereotype of the Southern 
California girl. 
</P>
<P>
At Smith, one of her closest friends was Shoba Mathew, a student from India 
receiving her first taste of American life. 
</P>
<P>
"Megan was my first American friend," Mathew says. "She helped me with culture 
shock of all different kinds. . . . She was a very quiet sort of person for the 
most part. She never spoke unless she had something to say, like her father. 
She was extremely systematic about everything she did and never wasted any 
time. Freshman year, during exams (which may be taken at any time during the 
exam period) she had everything done by the first day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Next to my sister, she was one of the most compulsively perfectionist people I 
ever knew." But she could also be "a lot of fun," Mathew says. "She was very 
good at mimicking people . . . and she could do a mean imitation of Tina Turner 
in 'Private Dancer.' She definitely had a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
A nature lover, Megan Jones often took long bike rides and walks by herself. 
"She really enjoyed being alone," Mathew says. "It re-energized her. It was 
what, in the end, gave her such strength." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mathew, Megan Jones didn't date anyone in particular, but "she 
always had a dry, deadpan attitude about it. 'Well, if it happens, it happens,' 
she'd say, 'but I'm not going to waste my time over it.' " (Chadlyn Jones says 
her daughter once told her about a boy who called her late at night and 
couldn't understand why she would rather work on her art than go out with him. 
"If you don't understand that, I can't see you," she told him.) 
</P>
<P>
Her work was "her first priority." In "Portrait of a Story," a long essay that 
the young artist kept private during her lifetime (her mother arranged to have 
it published after her death in a private edition published at Smith College), 
Megan Jones describes her work on a still life she called "Eternal Force" -- 
the most ambitious drawing she made. 
</P>
<P>
Her still life consists of several carefully positioned images: three evenly 
spaced paper sacks of wildflowers; 12 lustrous loose pearls, a slice of angel 
food cake with a knife and fork arranged so their shadows form a cross; an egg 
in a cup, a bar of Dove soap wrapped in a napkin and a half-filled Coke bottle. 
The individual texture of each object is remarkably clearly defined, from the 
gleam of the silverware to the transparency of the heavy glass bottle and the 
dense sponginess of the cake. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote that she had purchased the wildflowers, stuck them in Pepperidge Farm 
cookie bags and noticed one day how nice they looked in a chance ray of winter 
sun. The plan of the still life took shape during Christmas vacation, when she 
devised a symbolic meaning for the composition. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," she mused, with an acuity beyond her years, "in 1985, beauty, 
pristine realism and integral clarity are not loud enough artistic 
considerations to speak with (or against) the shrill, and sometimes raucous 
voice of 'contemporary' art, which often confuses messages with propaganda and 
energy with hype. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor were these goals lofty enough to compete against the quiet side of 
modernism, where mere bland and banal inference is masked to show instead a 
false subtle profundity and meaningful shallowness." 
</P>
<P>
She wrestled with the problem of the inaccessibility of most symbolism to the 
average viewer but decided to imbue the work with specific Christian symbols 
reinterpreted in a fresh, complex way -- and not without humor. 
</P>
<P>
"The tone of the drawing should be peaceful, demure and reassuring but at the 
same time it is comic and almost sarcastic," Megan Jones wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The sunlit Coke bottle, representing the Incarnation, also stands for the blood 
of Christ, "which will be drunk," she wrote, "as Cokes usually are." The bar of 
Dove, a "symbol of cleanliness" that fits in with the Last Supper theme of the 
cleansing of sins, also represents the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
At Smith, in search of a place where the still life could remain intact for the 
many weeks it would take to finish drawing it, she decided to make her own 
studio in the attic of Parsons House, her dormitory. She crept upstairs from 
her first-floor room 5 or 6 days a week to work on the piece for at least 4 
hours at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"That cake was lying there for months!" Megan's friend Mathew said, laughing. 
"It would get fungus on it and Megan would just scrape it off." 
</P>
<P>
When classes were finished in the spring, Megan Jones still wasn't finished. 
She asked if she could stay in Parsons House through commencement and her 
request was denied. But she stayed an extra 10 days anyway, sleeping a few 
hours a night on the living-room couch, sneaking into the dining room for an 
occasional meal and suffering the "100-degree microwave effect" of being cooped 
up in an attic during the muggy Eastern summer. 
</P>
<P>
Janis Theodore, an assistant professor in the art department at Smith, 
supervised Megan Jones while she worked on "Eternal Force" as an independent 
studies project in still life drawing -- a private tutorial of a kind normally 
reserved for more advanced students. 
</P>
<P>
"Megan was one of the few students I had that was so skilled, so formed as an 
artist, as a draftsman," Theodore recalls, echoing the girl's other art 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"She was so clear in her conceptualization and what she wanted to do that there 
was very little direction I actually offered her. She would work on major 
projects that were so time-consuming -- they were something you would expect of 
someone who had completed graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to discuss her work with her because I think she felt it was so 
precious and so personal, and she was so clear in her direction that she -- how 
can I say? -- didn't really encourage constructive criticism. But I think 
that's because she was very mature as an artist at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Theodore says she did not mention many well-known artists she admired, but she 
did like the work of James Valerio and William Beckman, both East Coast realist 
painters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure she looked at Ingres and Vermeer," Theodore adds. "And I think her 
father had a lot to do with her formation. That kind of work ethic is very 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
John Paul Jones, whom friends say is still very distraught about his daughter's 
death, did not attend the opening of the exhibition and was not available for 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Megan Jones spent the summer of 1985 visiting Wales with her father and his new 
wife. She hadn't wanted to come home but her mother insisted, and she put the 
finishing touches on "Eternal Force" in Laguna Beach before she returned to 
Smith for her sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, her legs began to swell, and Mathew remembers she kept telling her 
friend -- without success -- to go to the doctor. Eventually, Megan Jones was 
obliged to wear bedroom slippers because she could no longer put on her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
In October, when she finally went to the infirmary, a CAT scan revealed a tumor 
as large as a football. She left immediately for California, telling Mathew 
that there was a growth, but not saying whether or not it was malignant. She 
said she hoped to be back in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"In the spring," Mathew said, "she said she'd be back in the fall (of 1986), 
and in the fall -- that's when she realized she would not be able to come back 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
After her operation at the UCLA Medical Center in November, Megan Jones began a 
course of treatment that included several experimental drugs. Her moods went up 
and down but "when she felt well her face glowed and she started doing her art 
again," her friend Mia Di Sandro recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Among her last pieces were little clay sculptures of women with attached 
haloes, "Eve I" and "Eve II." On the back of photographs of the pieces, she 
wrote, "Eve II is stronger and more self-assured than Eve I. Her body is 
painted to look like the marble at the UCLA hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end, her parents rented a guest house in Los Angeles to be near her. 
"I never believed she was going to die," Chadlyn Jones said. "We lived our 
lives as naturally as though there was a tomorrow. We were going out to dinner, 
going to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
In May, on the last day Megan Jones was alive, her parents brought "Soul 
Portrait" to the hospital room where she lay in a coma. Their daughter had 
specified the size and color of the stones to be set in the frame, and the work 
was now completed. Chadlyn took her daughter's hand and rubbed it across the 
top of the frame. 
</P>
<P>

Megan Hart Jones, remains through April 28 at the Ettinger Gallery of the Art 
Institute of Southern California, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach.

In memory of Megan Hart Jones, who attended the Art Institute of Southern 
California when it was known as the Laguna Beach School of Art, the school has 
established a scholarship fund. Contributions will be used to provide studio 
art scholarship awards for bachelor of fine arts students pursuing degrees in 
painting, drawing, sculpture or photography. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who contribute $250 to the fund will receive a small etching by 
Jones, either "English Sheep" -- tiny sheep scattered on a field sloping down 
from a panoramic landscape -- or "Flowers and Shells" in which the subjects are 
scattered within an abstract grid format. Those who contribute $25 or more will 
receive the tiny, privately printed booklet "Portrait of a Story" in which 
Jones writes with humor and passion about the experience of creating her major 
work, "Eternal Force." 
</P>
<P>

TV'S SUAVE 'REMINGTON STEELE' STILL TRYING TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE OF MAKING IT BIG 
ON THE BIG SCREEN

<TEXT>
<P>
A waitress dallied, taking a damp cloth to a clean tabletop. Nearby, four women 
in business suits were paying more attention to a diner than to their menus. 
</P>
<P>
Rearranging containers of sugar and Sweet 'N Low, the waitress wondered, "Do we 
need any more ice in our iced tea? And, how are we doing with that cappucino?" 
</P>
<P>
Waitresses are not always so attentive. And lunching professional women not so 
easily distracted. But, in this case, the object of their attention was Pierce 
Brosnan. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the polite Irishman, Brosnan smiled but didn't encourage chitchat with the 
waitress. Then he directed his gaze toward the ducks swimming in the "pond" in 
the atrium of the Embassy Suites Hotel -- his way of not interrupting the 
dialogue at hand, and getting on with an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan, 36, is famous as one of TV's prettiest leading men because of 
"Remington Steele" -- the NBC series in which he played a suave detective with 
a mysterious past. But that glamour image that's made him so much in demand may 
be taking a toll on his long-range goals. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: He's here starring in the dramatic caper, "Heist," a TV movie for 
HBO, and he's sitting for an interview to publicize "Around the World in 80 
Days" -- the globe-trotting NBC miniseries in which he stars. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't take much pressing to get Brosnan to admit that he'd much rather 
be making feature films. 
</P>
<P>
But how to shake that suave "Remington Steele" image? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a good fight," admitted Brosnan. "It needles a bit that some people 
really think I'm just like the character I played. It's really interesting how 
this dapper image, this model image, has come about. I've been party to it -- 
and got into it. Jeez, I like wearing clothes. But you know, it's pretty 
vacuous that kind of thing. After all, I trained and studied as an actor." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan mused: "Maybe I'm going through my ingenue period and I need to live in 
my face a bit more." 
</P>
<P>
He grew somber as he added, "But you know, with what's happened in my personal 
life, I've got less of, well, I still have hunger and ambition and desire, but 
things have also certainly been put into perspective." 
</P>
<P>
What put things in perspective for Brosnan was his actress-wife's battle with 
ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Cassandra (Cassie) Harris' cancer was diagnosed in late 1987. She has since 
gone through three surgeries and continuing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been nothing short of remarkable," said Brosnan. 
</P>
<P>
Taller and more rugged-looking than he appears on TV, the 6-foot-1 Brosnan was 
wearing loose-fitting black short-sleeve shirt, baggy pants and loafers without 
socks. 
</P>
<P>
The casual look was for an upcoming scene in "Heist," with Brosnan as an ex-con 
out for revenge against his former business partner (Tom Skerritt), who helped 
send him to prison and is now romantically involved with his wife (Wendy 
Hughes). 
</P>
<P>
"This movie works on a number of levels," explained Brosnan. "It's about how 
people con each other within relationships, as well as at the race track. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the character I play. He's tough -- a man who can handle himself." 
</P>
<P>
And what of persnickety Phileas Fogg, the 19th-Century aristocrat who wagers 
that he can travel around the world in 80 days? 
</P>
<P>
"He's a character with a good arc to him. In the beginning, he's a man who's 
very starchy and polished and reserved and private. For him, the unforeseen 
does not exist -- he lives his life by the book. Then he takes this wager. And 
as he travels around the world, he falls in love. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's this slow kind of crumbling of the man's interior. You see him 
reborn, as it were." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the classic Jules Verne adventure story, "Around the World in 80 
Days," begins airing tonight at 9 and continues Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The late David Niven played the role in the 1956 film. The Oscar-winning movie 
featured more than 40 name stars in bit parts, which for the first time were 
dubbed cameos. 
</P>
<P>
Does Brosnan worry about comparisons? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're treading on hallowed ground. David Niven was a well-loved 
performer. And mention of the movie always brings a smile to people's lips. But 
I think what people remember most about the original 'Around the World' is the 
balloon (that Fogg sails away in), and that there's a whole host of stars." 
</P>
<P>
When he was first offered the role, Brosnan -- who starred in the 1988 NBC 
miniseries "Noble House" -- nixed it. 
</P>
<P>
"He was leery about doing TV," recalled Susan Baerwald, who oversaw the project 
as NBC vice president of miniseries and novels for TV. (Baerwald, whose 
husband, Paul Baerwald, produced "Around the World in 80 Days," has sinced 
formed her own production company.) 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I told him, 'Read this (script) and understand that this is 
something you can watch with your children." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Brosnan admitted, it was the script by John Gay (whose credits 
include "Fatal Vision") that persuaded him. 
</P>
<P>
"I read it, and I agreed with the producers. It was a script I couldn't 
refuse." 
</P>
<P>
Before shooting "Around the World in 80 Days," Brosnan took six months off work 
in order to be with his ailing wife and take care of the household. (Together 
for nearly 16 years, the Brosnans have three children.) 
</P>
<P>
"She has got great inner strength and resilience," he said proudly, adding: 
"What's happened is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. It's a 
dreadful thing, it's a frightening thing. But somehow we have come through. I 
think it's been an enormous help that we have a good love and knowledge of each 
other, and of life. You just get through it." 
</P>
<P>
(Harris -- who co-starred in the Bond film "For Your Eyes Only" -- details her 
bout with cancer in the next issue of the National Enquirer. "Her good friend, 
Jill Ireland -- who also told her story to the Enquirer, and was very pleased 
with the reaction she received -- encouraged her to do it," said Brosnan's 
publicist.) 
</P>
<P>
A one-time commercial artist, Brosnan starred in British and TV stage 
productions before coming to America on the small screen in "The Manions of 
America." The 1981 miniseries was a bodice-ripping romantic saga that cimaxed 
with the death of the roguish Brosnan. 
</P>
<P>
"Remington Steele" quickly followed. "It was a great launch for a foreigner new 
to America," said Brosnan, recalling: "At the time, I didn't know what the word 
episodic meant." 
</P>
<P>
When "Remington" went off the air -- after more than four seasons -- Brosnan 
wanted to put light comedy behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go off and act. You know, show that I could do many different 
things. I did a few movies. 'The Fourth Protocol' was good. The others didn't 
hit the mark." 
</P>
<P>
The offbeat thriller, "Nomads" (1986), intrigued some critics but didn't play 
long enough to intrigue viewers. (But as the first film directed by John 
McTiernan, late of the blockbuster "Die Hard," it may ultimately garner a cult 
following.) In it, Brosnan is a bearded French anthropologist who discovers 
that bands of nomadic spirits are haunting modern-day Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He's a young British officer who infiltrates the notorious Thuggee cult of 
19th- 
</P>
<P>
Century India in "The Deceivers" (1988). Based on the classic novel by John 
Masters, the film was produced by Merchant Ivory Films. But it never got beyond 
the art houses. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Fourth Protocol," scripted by Frederick Forsyth from his best-selling 
novel, Brosnan purposely played against type. "I was a smoldering Russian 
sexual pervert who liked pillows and guns and killing women." (In an earlier 
incarnation, Brosnan also went weird -- playing a gay IRA hit man in a brief 
scene in "The Long Good Friday" (1980). 
</P>
<P>
He was a debt collector with violent modes of making people pay up in "Taffin." 
Filmed in Ireland on a shoestring budget in seven weeks, the drama went to 
video after a brief regional release. 
</P>
<P>
"That one came together very quickly. I squeezed it in between 'Noble House' 
and 'The Deceivers.' " Brosnan appeared to be mulling over his career to 
himself: "I can't keep on doing that sort of thing. I can't. 
</P>
<P>
"The next picture I do has got to have some thought behind it. Otherwise, I'll 
just never get off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he nearly got "off the ground" in a major way when he was chosen to 
replace Roger Moore as superspy James Bond. In the well-documented flurry that 
followed, Brosnan lost his shot when the producers of "Remington" decided to 
resurrect the canceled series and squeeze six more episodes out of it. (Brosnan 
was contractually bound to comply.) And so, it was Timothy Dalton as Bond in 
"The Living Daylights." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan initially chose to avoid seeing the film, "for obvious reasons." But 
the movie caught up with him when he was on a flight from London. "I was 
sitting with my little 4-year-old, who said, 'Daddy, when do you come on? When 
do I see you?' You see, he had lived through the whole James Bond episode. I 
said, 'Darling, I'm not in it. I didn't do the movie.' It turned out that his 
earphones were broken, so we shared mine." He smiled, adding: "We watched the 
movie with our heads together." 
</P>
<P>
If the Bond brouhaha is by now a tiresome subject for Brosnan, he believes that 
in a way it has worked to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm considered strictly TV because of the heat generated by 
Bond. So in that sense, I had my cake and ate it." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really strange. I've been given this script recently in which I'd play 
this maniacal high-powered conglomerate guy -- who cackles. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like Ian Dunross (the business baron of 'Noble House'), only twisted." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan admitted he's intrigued at the thought of playing this character. But . 
. . it's a supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a part of me that says, 'Let's go for the top -- let's go for the 
visibility.' " he confessed. "Another part -- the part that says I trained as 
an actor in the theater -- says go for the role, and for working with good 
people and surrounding yourself with good projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, I truly don't know. I dally between sort of going for the 
commercial and going for the sincere, truthful work. It's so confusing I give 
up thinking about it after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Because he's got a development deal at Columbia Pictures, Brosnan is also 
attempting to find his own roles. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dawn Steel, president of Columbia, who signed Brosnan to the deal. It 
happened after Steel chanced upon the TV airing of "Noble House." 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me an office -- a place to hang my hat," Brosnan explained. Currently 
in development there: A reworking of the Cary Grant comedy, "The Bachelor and 
the Bobby Soxer." 
</P>
<P>
According to producer Jerome Hellman ("The Mosquito Coast," "Coming Home," 
"Midnight Cowboy"), who acquired the remake rights, the romantic comedy will be 
retitled -- "because neither 'bachelor' or 'bobby soxer' would make much sense 
today." And there will be "a new interpretation." After all, surmised Hellman, 
"times -- and young people -- have changed a lot since the original came out in 
1947." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the project would return Brosnan to the light comedy he eschewed 
following "Remington Steele." Equally ironic: Brosnan's long been dubbed by the 
celebrity press as the '80s' Cary Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting that he's never thought of himself as Cary Grant-like ("there was 
only one Cary Grant"), Brosnan seemed relieved to report, "this wasn't one of 
the Cary Grant's best known films."
