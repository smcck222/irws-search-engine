Hundreds of friends and family members jammed a church in Englewood, N.J., for 
the Easter Sunday wake of a black teen-ager whose slaying last week by a white 
policeman sparked a night of unrest in neighboring Teaneck. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of Phillip Pannell, 16, collapsed and had to be helped outside the 
Community Baptist Church. Attending the wake were Nation of Islam minister 
Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights lawyer Alton H. Maddox 
Jr. Pannell was killed by officer Gary Spath, who said the youth was armed and 
refused oral commands to surrender. A .22-caliber revolver was found on the 
dead youth.

Several hundred people rallied at the U.S. Capitol and prepared to camp 
overnight on the grounds to publicize their call for restoration of $25 billion 
cut from the federal housing budget since 1981. David Hayden of Roanoke, Va., 
an organizer of the Housing Now march on Washington last October, said that 
members of Congress promised at that time to push for renewed spending on 
housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Easter rally, march and sleep-in at the Capitol were the last events of a 
"winter campaign" organized by the Community for Creative Non-Violence and the 
National Coalition for the Homeless. Activists from across the nation have 
alternated, for a week at a time, sleeping below a bridge under Interstate 395 
in the southeast quadrant of the District of Columbia. "I know we've been 
successful," Hayden said.

HARRY BRIDGES EULOGIZED AS CHAMPION OF WORKING PEOPLE

Harry Bridges, the Australian-born seaman whose waterfront union organizing 
spread from the West Coast docks to the Hawaiian sugar plantations, was 
eulogized as a man who remained the champion of working men and women up to his 
death at 88. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry was an ordinary man . . . a working stiff (who) articulated the demands 
and desires of the people he represented," labor arbitrator Sam Kagel told the 
audience packing the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union 
headquarters on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A New Orleans-style band played the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" at the public 
memorial honoring the naturalized American who founded the ILWU and fought four 
deportation attempts by U.S. officials who claimed he was a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the docks halted Saturday in Washington state where about 70 union 
members, leaders and retirees paid last respects, the second shutdown of West 
Coast ports in two weeks. The day after Bridges died of emphysema on March 30, 
9,000 union members along the coast walked off the job. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges sailed from Australia as a teen-ager and was returned to the sea last 
week when his ashes were scattered near the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of guests at the memorial Saturday included the old liberal wing of 
San Francisco's Democratic leadership: Mayor Art Agnos, former Mayor Joseph L. 
Alioto, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges was the son of a well-off Australian real estate owner and never forgot 
the poverty he saw collecting rents for his father in the Melbourne slums. He 
came to the United States as a merchant sailor at a time when seafarers labored 
under some of the worst conditions arising from the Industrial Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges led members of a rebel local of the corrupt International 
Longshoremen's Assn. in the 1934 waterfront strike that sparked the city's only 
general strike and creation of the ILWU.

YOUTH GYM IN A FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
AUSTERITY: AN OXNARD BOXING CENTER IN A WORKING-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD COULD BE THE 
VICTIM OF CITY BUDGET CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the outside, La Colonia Youth Boxing Center in Oxnard doesn't look like 
much. But the single-story, stucco building on First Street in the heart of La 
Colonia, a gritty, working-class neighborhood with one of the city's highest 
crime rates, is bursting with energy. 
</P>
<P>
On any given day the gym is crammed with up to 50 sweaty youths, beating on 
punching bags, skipping rope, shadowboxing and sparring with one another. 
</P>
<P>
The gym is so popular with the neighborhood's mostly Latino boys that Martin 
Noriega, the gym's director, said he regularly turns away young boxing hopefuls 
who are willing to pay the $3-a-month fee to join the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are understaffed so we can't take any more," said Noriega, who 
runs the gym with the help of trainer Eduardo Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a city budget crunch, city officials said they cannot afford to 
expand the gym or hire more trainers. In fact, the gym, which operates on an 
annual budget of about $50,000, is on a list of city services that the City 
Council will consider for budget cuts in June. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's resources are such that we are unable to expand the gym," said 
Parks and Recreation Director Gary Davis. "It's a wonderful program. It is well 
received and they have produced some good boxers." 
</P>
<P>
In order to help balance an anticipated $1.8-million deficit in the 1990-91 
budget, the City Council will consider about $500,000 in cuts from the Parks 
and Recreation budget alone, he said. The list of potential budget cuts also 
includes the Carnegie Art Museum, which costs the city about $175,000 to 
operate annually. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, city officials discovered that estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 
fiscal year were about $2 million too high. It was also disclosed that the city 
had exceeded its 1988-89 budget by $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the gym's budget pays for the maintenance of the building and the 
salaries of Noriega and Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega said he fears the gym will be the first cut on the council's budget 
chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
"If they eliminate this they are going to take away from the area where it is 
needed the most," Noriega said. 
</P>
<P>
The gym's equipment, including three speed bags, several heavy punching bags 
and a time-worn ring, were purchased with money the boxers earned at 
fund-raisers and monthly boxing shows at the Oxnard Elks Lodge, Noriega said. 
</P>
<P>
Morale at the gym suffered another blow last week, when four of the gym's top 
boxers were forced to cancel plans to compete in the regional Golden Gloves 
boxing tournament in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who has taken a team of boxers to the tournament each year for the 
past five years, is recovering from back surgery and was unable to drive the 
team to the fights. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Noriega took four boxers to the tournament, all four won the 
championships in their weight division, he said. One boxer won the state title 
in the 132-pound category, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So, yeah, the boxers were disappointed," said Noriega, who learned to box as a 
youngster, but never competed as an amateur or a professional. 
</P>
<P>
Boxers between the ages of 8 and 16 are allowed in the gym between 4 and 5:30 
p.m. Boxers over 16 use the gym after 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to the gym, the walls were lined with young men doing 
jumping jacks and stretching exercises, while others worked out with jump ropes 
and speed bags. The smell of sweat and the sound of boys pounding punching bags 
and skipping rope filled the room. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the ring, two young boys wearing large red gloves and head gear traded 
jabs while several older boxers looked on and shouted encouragement. The boys 
fought furiously and then listened to instructions from Noriega and Garcia 
between rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Fernando Chavez said he spends every afternoon in the gym 
working on his boxing skills in hopes of some day becoming a world champion. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from learning how to throw an effective uppercut and a stinging jab, 
Fernando said he has learned "how to get along with others and how to be able 
to follow instructions." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando said that if it was not for the gym he would be "sitting at home, 
watching TV and falling asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Reyes, 11, said he has attended the gym for three years and hopes to 
follow in the footsteps of his hero, Julio Cesar Chavez, an undefeated Mexican 
boxer who has been champion in three weight classes since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando said that since he became a regular at the gym he no longer eats candy 
and other junk food. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how to get in shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega said his biggest challenge is trying to provide each young boxer with 
some personal instruction and encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot of kids that because we could not give them attention they get 
discouraged and leave," he said. "I see them on the streets later." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, whose two sons, Robert, 15, and Daniel, 23, learned to box at La 
Colonia gym, agreed. "There are kids that if they had more attention would go 
much further," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Garcia, who began boxing at the gym when it first opened 11 years ago, 
said he became a professional boxer at the age of 17 and now has a record of 14 
victories and four defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who still trains at La Colonia with his father and brother, said he 
doesn't mind the overcrowding at the gym but believes many of the boys could 
become good professional boxers if they had more supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of kids here that have a possibility of making it," he said.

MILITARY: MARINES USE COST-EFFECTIVE ELECTRONIC WAR GAMES TO TRAIN COMMAND 
OFFICERS FOR THE REAL THING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lt. Col. Bob Robichaud's men are dying somewhere and he's moving around in his 
dusty command post, anxiously awaiting field reports. 
</P>
<P>
He fidgets with his helmet's tight chin strap, chewing and spitting so much 
tobacco juice on the ground that there's almost no safe place to step any more. 
</P>
<P>
Robichaud's Marine battalion had been fighting elusive bands of guerrillas in 
the Honduran countryside when a large enemy force suddenly began pushing up 
from the south. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered part of his battalion to rush south and block the enemy, but 
something went wrong. A key bridge was blown, stalling the Marine's advance. 
When the clash finally occurred, it was in a strategically weak position, far 
from where the Marines had plotted to engage. 
</P>
<P>
The field report was chilling as it came to Robichaud's cramped command post 
over the radio: "We are all wounded or in hiding or KIA. Please advise." 
</P>
<P>
A 40-man Marine platoon had been mauled, and, although the clash then broke 
off, enemy troops were scurrying to flank the main Marine units and pass 
northward to a key objective, a city where they could hold out in long 
house-to-house combat. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was critical, and it called for a harrowing, decisive command 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Just the time to take a break. Talk about the day's events and maybe relax for 
a spell. Wander over to the Coke machine or watch the plump black cat that 
coyly meanders, quite unimpressed, through these tense proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
You can do that when war is a game, serious, but still a game in which winning 
and losing is less important than how well it's played. 
</P>
<P>
Robichaud is real, right down to his beard stubble, dropped verb endings and 
Red Man chewing tobacco. And his staff officers are real, too. But otherwise, 
this is a battle using computer simulation and largely phantom forces. 
</P>
<P>
More Camp Pendleton command staffs are training this way as the new stability 
in Europe brings military budget cuts that have persuaded the top brass to rely 
on cheaper ways to teach war. 
</P>
<P>
This program is called the Tactical Warfare Simulation Evaluation Analysis 
System, and the man who runs it, Lt. Col. Hugh O'Donnell Jr., figures the 
paltry $150 cost for a battalion-level staff exercise is far less expensive 
than turning a 900-man Marine battalion out for maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs money to take people out into the field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The system was used nine times in the last fiscal year, but with the changing 
budgetary climate, O'Donnell expects 20 exercises this year. 
</P>
<P>
While the computer is vintage 1960s technology, O'Donnell said a faster, more 
sophisticated system is due in mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
The greater emphasis on computer simulation reflects another peacetime reality 
-- with the Vietnam War over for 15 years, most Marine officers and senior 
sergeants with combat experience have left the corps. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell and Robichaud believe the computer-aided exercises come closer than 
anything to real war, even though the stage for these exacting military mind 
games is fairly simple. 
</P>
<P>
At a scruffy and remote part of Camp Pendleton is a tight group of trailers 
that contain the Marines who maneuver the troops, fire the artillery and 
mortars, wage air combat, handle intelligence, and manage logistics for the 
unit being tested. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 feet away is the command post for the Marine battalion command staff, 
whose leader, a lieutenant colonel like Robichaud, decides what skills will be 
tested and sets up the tactical situation. 
</P>
<P>
The "enemy" has its own command post in a trailer, and the commander is a 
member of O'Donnell's staff, an intelligence officer who knows how foreign 
armies fight and gives the Marines a realistic challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Two opposing commanders decide the moves, and the computer simulates the 
outcome. For example, the Marine leader may launch an attack with ground forces 
supported by aircraft. But the enemy might shoot down the aircraft and cut off 
the Marines from retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The computer outlines the situation to the Marine commander, forcing him to 
then consider options such as how to resupply the trapped Marines, evacuate 
them or get a relief force through to them. 
</P>
<P>
Through these weeklong exercises, Marine commanders improve their tactical 
decisions, staffs learn to work together, and the unit's readiness is 
evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to come out here and feel they can make mistakes and innovate," 
O'Donnell said. "We don't give a unit commander a report card." 
</P>
<P>
The computer simulation hasn't done away with full-scale maneuvers, during 
which a commander's performance is put under a microscope, but the war game 
gives a command staff intense intellectual batting practice without using mass 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Last week , Robichaud, commander of the Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment, 
took about 65 actual Marines and a phantom force of 1,600 into a mock battle in 
Honduras, where the Marines have conducted operations. 
</P>
<P>
Robichaud, a serious, courtly man with 20 years in the Marines, has put his 
staff through long days and some sleepless nights to realistically practice 
what he calls "the little things that make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
He's not as interested in smashing the enemy commander as in having his staff 
master the critical basics of military operations. Those include staging an 
orderly advance, gathering and using accurate information, and making sound 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important to me is procedure," said Robichaud, who, like his staff, is 
dressed in battle gear to create the mood. The simulation is "the most 
effective and efficient way to train a staff." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Robichaud and his battalion are in combat with guerrillas in the Honduran 
countryside and have the situation under control until he learns that a large 
enemy force is moving up from the south. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines race south, hoping to confront the enemy before they advance far 
enough to take control of a city. But the bridge is blown, the Marines meet the 
foe in the wrong place, and the chaos of battle reigns. 
</P>
<P>
The enemy commander, 1st Lt. John Lutkenhouse of O'Donnell's team, watches the 
fight as depicted on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can stop my advance he's achieving his mission," Lutkenhouse said. "If I 
can draw away from his main force (and reach the city), I'm achieving mine." 
</P>
<P>
In the trailer where Robichaud's company commanders are transmitting battle 
reports, the action picks up, and suddenly it's not at all like a game. 
</P>
<P>
Company commanders have panic and frustration in their voices as they report 
that the enemy is trying a flanking maneuver around the Marines. Within 
moments, the room begins to smell of sweating bodies in camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
(Enemy commander Lutkenhouse takes satisfaction in the Marines having detected 
and communicated to base that he is trying to flank them. "The fact they 
figured it shows they're using their intelligence and anticipating my moves," 
he said.) 
</P>
<P>
There's also tension back at Robichaud's command post as the reports on enemy 
movements come in. Robichaud tells a visitor, almost good-naturedly, "go ahead, 
I'm shot. The executive officer is running things for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Robichaud's operation's officer, Capt. E.C. Holt, is examining the battle maps 
and complaining about inaccurate field reports that caused delays. This may be 
a game, but, Holt observed, "it's got all the friction you can handle." 
</P>
<P>
This was Robichaud's third simulation, and he remarked, "the troops really get 
into it hot and heavy. They're real competitive, but that's not the purpose."

5% UTILITY USERS TAX TO BE DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed 5% utility users tax will be the subject of debate at a televised 
public forum May 14 in the Oxnard City Council Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C, to be decided on the June 5 special municipal election ballot, would 
create a 5% utility users tax on businesses and residents for placement in a 
general fund to support city services such as police, fire and street 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would apply to gas, electric, cable TV and telephone service for 
residences, plus water, sewer and trash service for businesses. Proponents 
state in election literature that the tax, which would cost most residents 
about $4 per month and exclude low-income families, would help make up 
reductions in city services caused by budgetary restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents criticize the proposal as a permanent utility tax to solve a 
temporary problem. They oppose the tax because the revenues it generates will 
be placed in a general fund rather than being directed toward specific city 
services, and because it lacks a sunset clause or provision for periodic 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce has opposed the measure until the completion and 
publication of a city operations and management audit. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, to be held at 7:30 p.m., will be televised over channels 6 and 17.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; 
</P>
<P>
SEARCH CONTINUES FOR SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities were searching Sunday for the 61-year-old pilot of a single-engine 
plane and his passenger, believed missing after taking off from Santa Paula 
Airport more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, whose names were not released by the Civil Air Patrol, were 
reported missing April 12, said Capt. Diane Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
A friend said the men had plans to fly from Santa Paula to Bakersfield on April 
7, but no one noticed that they were missing until the pilot did not come in to 
work to pick up his paycheck, Blanchard said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are fairly certain that the two men left Santa Paula Airport on 
April 7, but the pilot did not file a flight plan indicating his destination, 
Blanchard said. Checks at Bakersfield Airport and other area airports produced 
no sign of the small, red and white, high-wing plane, Blanchard said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had gotten on it earlier, the chances would have been better. All 
airplanes have emergency locater transmitters . . . the signal would have been 
stronger," Lt. Katherine Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Air Patrol began searching Friday morning from Bakersfield Airport, 
Kelley said. Twenty planes from Camarillo Airport began searching in Ventura 
County on Saturday, and 10 planes searched Sunday. The Civil Air Patrol reduced 
the number of search planes Sunday because of Easter, Blanchard said. The 
Ventura County Sheriff's Aviation Unit, which flies helicopters, was also 
called over the weekend to help search, Blanchard said.

SORTING OUT THREATS BY DISTURBED, DANGEROUS; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITIES: POLICE SOMETIMES START WITH ONLY A SINGLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL AND 
FOLLOW THEIR INSTINCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One man writes letters threatening to murder Mayor Tom Bradley unless he ends 
three-day holiday weekends for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Another threatens to enter markets and poison the San Fernando Valley's food 
supply unless the city pays him $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
And a third man, previously found not fit to stand trial for murder and sent to 
a state hospital for the criminally insane, threatens a major producer. He 
wants to be cast as the star of the producer's next movie. 
</P>
<P>
The man sentenced to three years in prison last week for threatening to shoot 
KNBC-TV newscaster Kelly Lange is far from unique. The rifle-toting woman who 
recently barricaded herself in the unoccupied Studio City house belonging to 
actress Sharon Gless is not unusual either. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nearly every month the Los Angeles Police Department investigates 
individuals who threaten celebrities, politicians or public property. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these incidents never come to public attention because the person 
making the threats commits no crime or isn't caught. 
</P>
<P>
Police who investigate the threats often start with only an unsigned letter or 
a secretary's recollection of a short, unsettling phone call. They depend 
largely on instincts to protect those threatened and to catch those writing 
bothersome notes or making intrusive phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I think there is any possibility or any hint that there could be criminal 
action, I will have it investigated right away," said William Booth, commander 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's press relations unit, who often receives 
complaints from celebrities about threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the threats are explicit, sometimes they are not. You might have to 
read between the lines, but you can not take a chance that a threat is not 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The police visit the threatened person to investigate the intrusion. If the 
identify of the writer is available and if it's possible a crime will be 
committed, Booth may have a policeman visit the writer. 
</P>
<P>
"You let them know they are getting very close to violating the law," Booth 
said. "Some of the language they are using, they are getting carried away. The 
bottom line is, 'Hey, knock this off.' And often it works. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the only threat is to the sender, like I'm going to hurt myself if 
you don't do such and such. We pay attention to those, too." 
</P>
<P>
A person can be accused of a misdemeanor if there is an intentional threat to 
kill or seriously harm an individual or his or her family. The crime can become 
a felony if the target of the threat reasonably believes that he or she is in 
danger, or if a member of the target's immediate family reasonably believes 
that the intended target is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said another technique to stop offensive letters is to get the 
celebrity's agent to write the person sending the letters. 
</P>
<P>
"The representative writes that the mail to the celebrity comes to our agency 
and the celebrity has not seen any of your letters and you would not be able to 
make contact with her if you came here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a turnoff. If you can get something to them that they are not talking to 
this individual, sometimes they will give up." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ed Brimmer of the Los Angeles Police Department's Criminal Conspiracy 
Section, the main unit investigating threatening communications, said 
threatening letters often are distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to be blind to miss them," he said. "They all have kinds of 
graffiti or goofy-looking characters, spaceships or who knows what on them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said he has trained employees in the city mail room to handle the 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
"They are to take it and put it in a big plastic bag we have given them," he 
said. "We would take the letter in the hopes that you could get a fingerprint 
off it. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of the time the girl opens it with a knife and reads it and then 
realizes it's a letter from someone exhibiting bizarre behavior. We probably 
don't get fingerprints very often." 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said once the department gets the threatening letter or, in some cases, 
a recording of a telephoned threat, detection becomes a "chess game." 
</P>
<P>
"You never know when the next move is going to be made. He has highs and lows. 
His actions seem energized. We will get lots of communications. They seem to 
self-aggrandize. One man said I have the ability to poison all the food, all 
the water in the San Fernando Valley. I have special training. Their 
imagination sets the limits. 
</P>
<P>
"After you listen to that for a while, you know what you are dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said his layman's observation is that a person who makes anonymous 
threats is far less dangerous than one who signs his name and takes a step 
toward fulfilling the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The anonymous person who makes the bomb threat is a non-confrontative person 
and he's doing it to be vindictive," Brimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He does not have the ability to make the bomb," Brimmer said. That person, 
however, senses exhilaration through "the commotion it causes and the mass 
evacuation of the building and the calling of the Police Department," Brimmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a person who is relatively powerless exercising great, great power. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who signs his name is a lot sicker. He will go down to the station 
with a knife or if you talk to him he will tell you there are forces which tell 
him to do that -- some guiding light or his mother in outer space." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dennis A. Conte, commanding officer of the Police Department's detective 
support division, said a well-publicized threat always raises worries about 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be trends," he said. "Look at the freeway shootings, for example. 
We have seen mass killings nationwide where they seem to happen one after the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said the man threatening Mayor Bradley over the issue of employee 
weekends "gets very nasty and racial." 
</P>
<P>
"He calls here any number of times. We have had a running relationship with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I explained to him one time on the phone that I took care of the mayor's 
itinerary so if he wanted to have an audience with the mayor, just say where 
and when. I was trying to bring him in," said Lee Castruita, a detective in the 
criminal conspiracy section. 
</P>
<P>
"He stopped calling when he realized we were trying to trace the calls," 
Brimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like he's an older man who's unbalanced. I'm not a clinician, but 
the kind of stuff he's talking about, he's got to have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said the man who threatened the Valley's food and water supply sent 
letters to the city from many postmarks. 
</P>
<P>
"My way of communicating with him was to run an ad in the Daily News. I ran it 
for 10 or 12 days and assured him that I had received his correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not hear from him and then he'd write me another letter and let me 
know what he wanted me to do. 
</P>
<P>
"In one ad I asked where we could make the money drop. I think I was going to 
wrap it in a canvas bag and throw it out of a car heading west on the Ventura 
Freeway near White Oak. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not going to use real money. We might get $100 and wrap it around 
paper. You tell him whatever you can get away with. 
</P>
<P>
"In one letter he said I should meet him at Fallbrook Mall. Then another letter 
said he had warned me about not staking out the location and he was over there 
and saw police looking for him. I am sure he was just trying to pull our chain 
because on the information we had, we had too big an area to even attempt to 
find him." 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said that because most of the man's geographical references were from 
the Valley, he thought the writer lived there. One of the markets he threatened 
to poison was in the Fallbrook Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"After about six months, he finally just stopped. From the kind of nonsense we 
were playing, I estimated he was a male Caucasian 60 to 70 years old, probably 
retired, sitting at home with very little to do and that he became very 
interested in this cat-and-mouse game. 
</P>
<P>
"It started as extortion, but he never attempted to collect the money. I had to 
rule out real criminal intent. I thought it was fun-and-games time for him." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also decided no serious threat was posed by the San Jose area man 
who threatened a major producer and his wife if the man did not get the lead 
role in the producer's movie. 
</P>
<P>
Conte said he did not want to use the producer's name in the event somebody 
reads the story "and decides to make another attempt." 
</P>
<P>
He said the writer made "no death threat, but there was a veiled threat we 
needed to pursue. I think the innuendo was a threat of bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
"We immediately contacted the representatives of this celebrity and made an 
appointment to meet with them to find out how this threat came to the 
producer's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out the man who made the threat lived in a small town outside San 
Jose. We learned that he had been found not fit to stand trial for murder and 
had been been paroled from Atascadero State Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Brimmer said he asked a friend on the San Jose Police Department to interview 
the man. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer phoned back that it was difficult to determine whether the man was 
harmless, but that he had not broken any laws," Brimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed. "There was nothing we could do," Conte said. "He was not 
within that area that required incarceration or hospitalization." 
</P>
<P>
When the producer's security staff traveled to San Jose to talk to the police, 
they received photos and a physical description of the man and a report on the 
police interview. 
</P>
<P>
The man remains under close supervision by a parole officer.

FUND-RAISING AGENCY INVESTIGATED FOR FINANCES, METHODS; 
</P>
<P>
DONATIONS: THE ORGANIZATION RAISED MORE THAN $500,000 IN A 19-MONTH PERIOD BUT 
LESS THAN 7% WENT TO PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale-based American Veterans Committee, a nonprofit corporation, was 
founded in 1986 to raise money for people who defended their nation in the 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Today the organization, which seeks donations by telephone, is itself under 
attack. Government officials, other veterans groups and even some of the 
committee's beneficiaries have accused it of deceptive tactics, inefficient use 
of funds and faulty financial reporting. 
</P>
<P>
According to records submitted to the city of Los Angeles, the committee raised 
more than half a million dollars during a 19-month period from 1986 through 
1988 and gave less than 7% of it to charitable programs. Most of the remaining 
donations paid for fund-raising expenses, including solicitors' fees and 
telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's expenses far exceed the average for Los Angeles fund-raisers 
and the voluntary standards set by national watchdog groups. But the U.S. 
Supreme Court has ruled that states and cities cannot mandate how much a 
fund-raiser must give to a cause. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, state and local officials are investigating the American Veterans 
Committee on other fronts: 
</P>
<P>
* A division of the California attorney general's office recently revoked its 
state tax exemption, saying that the committee has not filed the required 
financial statements for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles Social Service Department has denied the committee a license 
to seek donations in Los Angeles, saying it lacks a federal tax exemption. It 
also alleges that the group improperly raises money by phoning on behalf of 
non-existent organizations that purport to serve battered women and blind 
children. 
</P>
<P>
* Glendale police are investigating more than a dozen written complaints and 
about 30 telephone inquiries concerning the committee's telephone pitches over 
the past year. The department also is reviewing the committee's financial 
records. No criminal charges have been filed, however. 
</P>
<P>
Frank E. Burford, 67, the Glendale accountant who heads American Veterans 
Committee on a volunteer basis, denied any fund-raising improprieties. He said 
the group operates within the law and raises money for respected programs such 
as the Veterans Administration Medical Center in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that his fund-raising costs are high, he insisted that no 
one is profiting from the committee. 
</P>
<P>
A grandfatherly man with white hair and bushy eyebrows, Burford said he takes 
no salary for supervising the group from his modest office in an older Central 
Avenue high-rise. Burford, who originally was the accountant for American 
Veterans Committee but took over as president after its founder, Harry Reid, 
left the group in late 1987, dismissed the criticism by Los Angeles officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they're trying to do this to the little organization I head 
up," he said. "All I'm getting is a lot of flak from a lot of bureaucrats down 
there who probably don't give 10 cents a year to charity. All I'm doing is 
requesting a license. They could certainly put us on probation if they want to. 
They can come in and inspect our books." 
</P>
<P>
Burford said his committee's expenses include about 30 employees, among them 
solicitors, drivers and managers. But he said no one in the organization has 
ever made more than $30,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Burford, a Los Feliz resident, said his interest in helping veterans dates back 
to his frequent visits to the VA hospital in Westwood, where his father 
received treatment. Burford said he served in the South Pacific with the U.S. 
Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Glendale, the San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles have complained 
to Glendale police about telephone solicitations from Burford's organization. 
</P>
<P>
Tania Peneno, a financial crimes investigator for the Glendale Police 
Department, has asked law enforcement agencies throughout the region to relay 
to Glendale police any complaints received about American Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Burford has provided police with some financial information regarding his 
organization, but Peneno said Glendale lacks the resources to conduct a full 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
The low-profile committee is seeking a professional fund-raiser's license that 
would allow it to phone Los Angeles residents and, Burford said, increase the 
percentage of donations that can be given to worthy causes. A license for 
telephone fund-raising is not required in Glendale and other small cities. 
</P>
<P>
In turning down the request, Robert D. Burns, general manager of the Social 
Service Department, said Burford's solicitors also claim to represent the Child 
Abuse Network, Battered Women's Society, Blind Children's Society and United 
Missions Society. The city official described these as "non-existent 
organizations" that Burford's solicitors use to generate sympathy -- and 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter denying Burford's application, Burns wrote, "If you were granted a 
professional fund-raiser's license, you and your representatives would commit 
fraud and/or deception upon the residents of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Burford said his other organizations are legal because he has registered the 
names with the county. 
</P>
<P>
He has appealed Burns' decision to the city's Social Service Commission. A 
March 26 hearing was postponed until April 23 after Burford, an accountant, 
asked for a delay until the end of the tax season. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate that he has funded worthy programs, Burford sent Los Angeles 
officials a copy of a $200 American Veterans Committee check, dated Aug. 26, 
1987, given to the Women's and Children's Crisis Shelter in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some beneficiaries have sent donated money back to American Veterans 
Committee to avoid being tainted by its tactics. They feared that the veterans 
group would damage their reputation and their own fund drives. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Baker, director of the Whittier shelter, said she at first welcomed the 
unsolicited donation. Soon afterward, however, she received calls from shelter 
supporters, asking if a fund drive were under way. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said she learned that American Veterans Committee solicitors were calling 
for donations on behalf of the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter supporters were concerned because immediately after they agreed to 
donate, a committee member came to their homes to pick up the check, a practice 
that is frowned upon by most fund-raising groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Better Business Bureaus, in a "Tips on Charitable Giving" 
pamphlet, recommends that donors not "succumb to pressure to give money on the 
spot or allow a 'runner' to pick up a contribution; the charity that needs your 
money today will welcome it just as much tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Baker visited a Downey office where American Veterans Committee solicitors were 
calling for donations. She asked the group to stop and later put a warning 
notice regarding the calls in the shelter's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
She told Burford's committee that it was not authorized to use the shelter's 
name. On Oct. 30, 1987, the shelter issued a $200 refund check to American 
Veterans Committee, but Baker said it was never cashed. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 11, 1988, the shelter received another check from American Veterans 
Committee, this time for $1,000. The shelter's attorney, Kathleen A. Tomeo, 
returned the check a few weeks later with a "cease and desist" letter. 
</P>
<P>
She added, "Rest assured that we will continue our efforts to thwart your 
fraudulent solicitation on behalf of this organization." 
</P>
<P>
The director of a second battered women's shelter in south Los Angeles County 
said she returned $500 donated by Burford's committee because its solicitors 
similarly sought money on behalf of that shelter without its permission. 
Because of concerns about negative publicity, she asked that the shelter's name 
not be published. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is critical of Burford's group. The Glendale committee has 
received letters of gratitude for its donations to the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Burford gave Los Angeles city officials a list of activities the committee 
sponsored last year at the hospital, including patient trips to Disneyland, 
Universal Studios, the Los Angeles Zoo and Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The financial value of these trips was not listed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of the better groups," said Ed Spohr, a hospital spokesman. "They 
have done a fair amount. Most of the time, there's no money exchanged. They 
purchase the tickets for Disneyland or Universal Studios or wherever the 
veterans are going to visit." 
</P>
<P>
Burford blamed his poor ratio of expenses to donations on high start-up costs 
and a lack of volunteers that more familiar charities rely on. He described his 
committee as an umbrella agency that channels money to worthy causes -- similar 
to the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
But in contrast to the 7% that Burford's group gave to charity, the United Way 
of Greater Los Angeles states that 86.5% of its donations go to programs and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Burford said the share he donates to worthy causes today is "up around 20%" and 
would be closer to 30% if he could seek donations in Los Angeles. He provided 
the city with no documentation to confirm he is now giving a larger share to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
A statement for the eight-month period ending May 31, 1988, said the committee 
received $269,145 in donations. The group's contributions to charity totaled 
$18,511. Overall expenses, including these contributions, were $237,304. This 
figure included $112,707 for solicitors' commissions and $20,318 for telephone 
service. Unspent revenue totaled $31,841. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Social Service Department records indicate that most local 
nonprofit groups have had better luck with the economics of fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1988-89, 762 direct-appeal fund drives reported generating $552 
million. From this total, 13% went to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The majority used 20% or less to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Two watchdog groups -- the National Charities Information Bureau and the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus -- recommend that a nonprofit group not 
spend more than 35% to 40% of its donations on fund-raising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But these voluntary limits on fund-raising costs cannot be imposed by law. 
</P>
<P>
In its most recent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 overturned a North 
Carolina law that prohibited fund-raisers from keeping an "unreasonable" share 
of charitable donations. In that case, state officials had considered the 
retention of more than 35% of the funds as too high. 
</P>
<P>
While regulators may object to such operations, their legal tools are limited. 
If the American Veterans Committee files the proper paper work for its state 
and federal tax exemptions, Los Angeles officials may have no grounds for 
stopping the group from seeking donations in the lucrative Los Angeles market. 
Burford said he plans to file the missing statements to regain his state tax 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand these attacks," Burford said. "They're inferring that this 
organization is for personal gain. But whose personal gain? It's not mine. And 
I have no relatives in the organization." 
</P>
<P>
An independent hearing examiner hired by the city of Los Angeles to review 
Burford's appeal recommended his fund-raiser's license be denied solely because 
American Veterans Committee does not have federal tax-exempt status, as 
required by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Burford said he applied for an IRS tax exemption in Los Angeles in 1987. He 
said he has no idea why federal officials have not acted on the application. 
The accountant said his committee has continued to represent itself as 
federally tax-exempt while the IRS reviews the application. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Levitzky, an IRS spokeswoman in Los Angeles, confirmed that the Glendale 
organization has no federal tax exemption, which normally takes no more than a 
year to process. She declined to comment further regarding the status of 
American Veterans Committee's application, citing privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
But in testimony before the hearing examiner, city investigator Shirley Flucus 
suggested Burford cannot get a federal tax exemption because the 
Washington-based American Veterans Committee, founded in 1943, already has one 
under that name. 
</P>
<P>
That group and the American Veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam have 
written to the city denying any connection with Burford's organization. 
</P>
<P>
"If the tax exemption is denied by the IRS, I will close the organization 
down," Burford said.

RESIDENTS OF DOWNTOWN APARTMENTS FLEE FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
DELIBERATELY SET: A WOMAN REPORTEDLY SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION ALLEGEDLY 
STARTED THE FIRE IN THE BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Four residents of a downtown apartment building, with many senior citizen 
occupants, suffered smoke inhalation Sunday afternoon from a fire set by a 
depressed woman who threw burning matches on her bed, fire department officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who authorities said suffered from a severe speech impediment, then 
dialed 911 from a hallway telephone at the Arlington Apartment-Hotel in a 
failed attempt to explain what she had done. Dispatchers could not understand 
the woman, but the building manager called moments later with the location of 
the fire, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia McFadden, 42, was being held Sunday night in County Jail at Las 
Colinas in Santee on suspicion of arson. When asked why she started the fire, 
she reportedly told authorities that it was "that time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The two-alarm blaze brought more than 60 firefighters to the three-story 
building at 7th Avenue and G Street, where rescue workers battled thick smoke 
to help at least 10 elderly residents climb through first-floor windows to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 80 residents -- mostly between 60 and 80 years old -- were evacuated 
within minutes after the fire was first reported at 1:27 p.m. Many elderly 
residents, some in wheelchairs, needed the help of neighbors to exit fire 
escapes, said Battalion Chief Victor Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
Goldie Smith, 87, was in good condition late Sunday at UC-San Diego Medical 
Center. Everett White, 76, was treated at Mercy Hospital and released. Lisa 
Betz, 22, was treated at Navy Hospital in Balboa Park and released. A fourth, 
unidentified victim was taken to a local hospital. Several residents were 
treated for smoke inhalation at the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Property manager James Hughes was in his first-floor office when he heard a 
woman talking loudly at a pay phone in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
"She was screaming at the top of her voice," he said. "She was stammering, she 
couldn't describe what was going on because she has a speech impediment." 
</P>
<P>
The panicked woman then led Hughes to a nearby door and handed him the key, he 
said. "I opened the door and tried to look inside but smoke came billowing out. 
So I quickly closed it shut and called 911." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jeff Carle of the Metro Arson Strike Team said the woman, sitting quietly 
on a curb across from the apartment building when he arrived, was placed in a 
nearby patrol car, where she explained how she started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Her speech impediment is serious," he said. "She had to write everything down 
on paper. Her initial indication was that she was suffering from depression. So 
she used matches and paper to start the fire on her bed." 
</P>
<P>
But the fire quickly got out of hand, Carle said. "Right after she set the 
fire, she realized what she had done and she got scared by it. What happened 
was not what she expected." 
</P>
<P>
McFadden's first-floor apartment was gutted and there was also damage to the 
hallway. Officials estimated $65,000 in total damage to the aging, white-washed 
building that residents said once served as a clinic for newborn babies. It 
took firefighters about 20 minutes to contain the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate this happened during the day while everyone was awake," Chief 
Smyth said. "There were many factors that could have made this a much more 
serious fire. The building is old and if she hadn't shut that door, the fire 
could have spread more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Once outside, many residents wanted to return to the building to help their 
neighbors, Hughes said. "But they couldn't," he said. "You have to see this 
kind of heavy smoke to understand what it's like to walk into it. You just 
can't breathe in there." 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters battled the blaze, Leslie Wheeler sat in his wheelchair on a 
nearby street corner and said he was glad to be alive. He had been listening to 
the radio in his first-floor apartment when a young neighbor came by his room 
to help him escape. 
</P>
<P>
"I pass by Mr. Wheeler's room every day and I know he doesn't have anyone to 
help him," said James Terry. "I went right into his room and said, 'Get up, 
there's a fire in here.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky he doesn't ask many questions. Because we got him right into his 
chair and out of there."

WASTING OUR FUTURE?; 
</P>
<P>
THE CAUSES OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS' PROBLEMS ARE HOTLY DISPUTED BY THOSE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING A CURE.; 
</P>
<P>
POINT...; 
</P>
<P>
A BUREAUCRACY REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOLS IS SPENDING MUCH OF ITS BUDGET ON 
ADMINISTRATION. STUDENTS GO WITHOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WAYNE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our schools are in deep trouble; our kids are not receiving the education they 
need. Seventy percent of our high-school graduates cannot read, write or 
compute math on the eighth-grade level. The dropout rate is about 40%. What is 
wrong? 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is under-funded, with about $4,500 a 
year from state, federal and local sources for each student. In contrast, New 
York provides $7,000 a year for each student. 
</P>
<P>
The little money that is available is spent unwisely and improperly. The 
district's 1988-89 budget was $3.5 billion. Almost 28% of that budget -- 
$969,977,000 -- was spent running the administrative offices at the region 
level and at headquarters downtown. At the same time, the district spent only 
$83,766,000 on textbooks and supplies for almost 600,000 kids. Thousands of 
kids have no textbooks to take home. Schools are forced to buy equipment, such 
as computers, from the district at higher prices than they would pay at retail 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
The district continues to provide chauffeur services for the superintendent at 
a cost in excess of $100,000 a year and free cars to upper-echelon 
administrators, 55 of whom are paid $100,000 to $164,000 per year, another 27 
between $90,000 and $99,900. 
</P>
<P>
Inflated administrative expenses force cuts in the actual educational process. 
Average class size is about 36 students per teacher, and the district plans to 
increase class size next year. Such large classes make learning difficult for 
the best students and deny lower-ability students the individual attention they 
need. Yet, there is one expensive administrator for every 11.6 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Most schools have severe shortages of books and other necessities like paper, 
maps and lab supplies. Large class size, year-round schools with no air 
conditioning during the hot months and shortages of necessary tools cripple the 
learning process. 
</P>
<P>
Very simply, classrooms are being starved by a bureaucracy that doesn't seem to 
understand that taxpayer dollars must be spent directly on the students. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the sad fact that of the 611 students caught last year with deadly 
weapons on our school campuses, only 15 were expelled. The district is not even 
providing safe schools, let alone a quality education program. 
</P>
<P>
What must be done to make a major turnaround? The problem is complex, but the 
solution is simple: The district must change its priorities to put the 
classroom first in claims on the budget and in decision-making power. 
</P>
<P>
The district must be held to a budget that allocates at least 70% of funds 
directly for children's educational needs. Administrative costs should never 
exceed 15% of the total budget. Major cuts must be made in administrative 
overhead. The eight region offices, which just expensively duplicate functions 
at the central administrative offices at 450 N. Grand Ave., should be closed. 
The district should cut 35% to 40% from the $377,098,000 in salaries at the 
downtown, region and division offices. Similar cuts should be made wherever 
highly paid functionaries absorb money that could go to classrooms. Even 
without additional funds from the state, these saved dollars could set the 
stage for big advances in education. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers must be allowed to use their creativity and knowledge of special needs 
in their classrooms. At present, district bureaucrats remote from the classroom 
dictate what, when, where and how to teach. That is the main reason 50% of all 
new teachers quit within five years. 
</P>
<P>
School-based management must be allowed to take root and grow. Parents, 
teachers and principals must have authority to develop curriculum and make all 
decisions affecting their school from bell schedules to what will be taught and 
who will be hired. Schools and classrooms should be tailored to suit the 
children in them. Obviously, schools must observe the laws and basic board 
policy, but other constraints are counterproductive. To implement their plans, 
schools must have the maximum funds available to buy textbooks and other 
equipment for use directly in the children's education, free of the 
stranglehold used by the district bureaucracy to impede local school decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Improving the school district boils down to a clear and possible proposition: 
Schools must be restructured, with students and the classroom becoming the top 
budget priority. When that change is made, more than 30,000 dedicated, 
professional teachers, nurses, librarians, psychologists and others, working 
with caring parents and principals, will be able to give Los Angeles' students 
the education they need and deserve.

CANADA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the only acceptable way to solve our health insurance crisis is by 
adopting a two-tier system. One form of insurance covers cost for basic health 
care, another a more comprehensive one. 
</P>
<P>
In the basic coverage, heroic measures such as neonatal care and organ 
transplantation will be totally excluded or only 50% covered. 
</P>
<P>
Today there is no great incentive for either the patients or the physicians to 
conserve our medical resources. I know of a case wherein an 84-year-old woman's 
relatives insisted on a coronary bypass procedure after having been advised 
that there was a zero chance for recovery. Unfortunately, were the physician to 
refuse to perform the procedure, he would face a lawsuit as certainly as the 
sun rises from the east. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, major legal reform will also be necessary to reduce both the direct and 
indirect cost on medical care. Under the Canadian system, a common procedure 
such as coronary bypass often requires months of waiting. I doubt that this is 
acceptable to most Americans.

METRIC MEASURES

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "U.S. Inching Toward Metric System" (Part Am April 7): Maybe slowly, 
but the meter is still running. 
</P>
<P>
Have you used any inch-and-three-eighths film lately: You'd probably answer 
more quickly if I asked "any 35-millimeter film." That's metric. 
</P>
<P>
We use the metric system a lot more than we realize. Our cars are marked with 
little metric measurements -- 1.9, 3.6 or whatever. Most packaged or canned 
foods, frozen dinners, bottled goods show metric measures. Vodka? Champagne? 
Even the bottles have changed to metric sizes. Even the labels seem to be 
saying "Take me to your liter!"

CANADA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial on cooling the medical cost epidemic (Editorials, March 27) 
informs us that the "Clinical Appropriateness Initiative" being developed by 
the RAND Corp. will attempt to define standards for what is or is not an 
appropriate surgery, a long overdue effort to eliminate the many unnecessary 
procedures now being performed. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the medical care crisis is a serious, complex problem 
requiring thoughtful, workable solutions, such as the fixed fee, universal 
coverage approach in Canada, combined with reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Our politicians, however, have a much simpler solution. No problem, don't 
address the structural flaws in our system, just let the employer pay for 
universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
What the politicians don't understand is that most businesses that don't offer 
employer-paid health insurance can't afford to. Many businesses are like mine, 
heavy on labor, with less than $150 per month per employee in net profit. 
Forcing the employer to pay insurance under these circumstances becomes a 
monetary impossibility.

So, Al Davis will talk about staying in L.A. if he gets $15 million (Metro,

there!

<P>
When I was dating, my boyfriend used to give my little brother a quarter to "go 
away and leave us alone."

If everyone who would like Al Davis to go to Oakland and leave Los Angeles 
alone would send him a quarter, maybe he'd get the message in the only language

Tom Clancy has been noted for his technical accuracy in his exciting novels. So 
it was with great disappointment that I noted his shallow article (Opinion, 
April 1) had no other apparent intent than to "bash" the U.S.-Japan 
relationship and all those who are trying to make it workable. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy states, "We are the customer -- what right does Japan have telling us 
what is wrong with America?" Does he not know of the negotiations of the 
Structural Impediments Initiative? The United States is telling Japan what is 
wrong with them, which by the way I support. Does Clancy expect Japan to say 
nothing? 
</P>
<P>
Disparaging remarks are made in frustration and are called bashing. Bashing 
begets bashing back and Clancy is contributing to it. He is also reminding us 
of World War II in order to harbor a picture of Japan still as an enemy and not 
the important ally it is.

CARTER MEETING WITH ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A most depressing picture appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times 
(April 5). 
</P>
<P>
It was Jimmy Carter shaking hands with PLO chief Yasser Arafat after their 
meeting with French leader Francois Mitterrand in Paris at the Elysee Palace. 
The former U.S. President said that the reason why he met with the PLO chairman 
is because Arafat wanted "peace" in the Middle East. Yeah! "Piece" of the West 
Bank, "piece" of the Gaza Strip, "piece" of Israel, "piece" of Palestine and so 
on.

CANADA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Socialized Medicine Cuts Canadian Costs -- and Care" (front page, April 
9). 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma of how society can bear the cost of good medical care for all and 
at the same time provide the latest and the best in high tech for some is 
brought in focus by the tragedy of Joel Bondy. 
</P>
<P>
He died while waiting for heart surgery because of the limited number of 
facilities providing such care in Canada. The same dilemma underlies the 
questions limiting the availability of trauma centers for all or just some or 
the use of rare and expensive therapy of any kind. Indeed, there is a 
philosophical anachronism in providing longer life, often useless and sometimes 
unwanted, when the drain on the Earth's resources caused by too many people 
causes so much pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that the United States, a wealthy entrepreneurial nation 
with a rich heritage in biomedical effort, would be in the forefront of 
providing high-tech medicine. To most participants in the system it is 
unthinkable that medical care would not provide the latest and the best to all 
who might need it. Indeed, this is what drives the machine. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been apparent to most participants in this "system" that the only 
factor limiting the provision of high-tech medicine to all who need it is 
financial cost. Realistically what Canada, Great Britain and, earlier Sweden 
and many communist countries, recognized is that their respective economies 
simply would not bear the cost. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that 
there will be no significant change in this country until the money runs out, 
as is occurring for an increasingly large portion of our society.

PADRES' SWEEP GIVES GIANTS THE BRUSH; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BENITO SANTIAGO HIT A TWO-RUN HOMER WITH ONE OUT IN THE NINTH INNING 
TO POWER HIS TEAM PAST SAN FRANCISCO, 4-3, SUNDAY FOR A THREE-GAME SWEEP OF THE 
DEFENDING NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAMPIONS. IT WAS THE TEAM'S FIFTH CONSECUTIVE 
VICTORY.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres came wandering into this city for the weekend rather bashful, and 
really, a bit reserved. Sure, they had the feeling all along that they were 
better than the San Francisco Giants. But when you're standing there watching 
the 1989 National League pennant going up the flag pole on Friday, and admiring 
the ring ceremony on Sunday, it's not exactly a good time to be running your 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
So the Padres waited all of about 45 hours, and once their 4-3 victory Sunday 
afternoon assured them of their first sweep of the Giants at Candlestick since 
1982, they figured this was as good a time as any to start telling the world 
about the new kid on the block in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Padres (5-2), who have won five consecutive games, stopped just short 
of guaranteeing a division championship. They still have yet to play the 
Cincinnati Reds, you know. But remember the Giants, that big, bad team who ran 
amok in the National League last season, intimidating everyone who stepped in 
their path? Well, if you listen to the Padres, the Giants have become nothing 
more than pussycats. 
</P>
<P>
"They just aren't the same team as they were last year," Padre catcher Mark 
Parent said. "I sensed that on Friday, they just don't seem as cocky. They 
don't intimidate us like they did before. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did this weekend was send a message to the Giants: 'You guys aren't 
even going to be competing with us this year.' And pretty soon, we'll be 
sending that same message to the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reds are the team to beat, anyway, not the Giants." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres showed no mercy. Sure, the Giants are having bullpen problems, and 
only one week of the baseball season has been completed, but the Padres talked 
of the defending champions as if they were the Bad News Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful feeling, isn't it," Padre first baseman Jack Clark said. 
"They teed off a lot of people last year. They thought they were the greatest 
thing last year, and they let everybody know it. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have that great of talent last year, and they're showing it now. 
Everybody's going to be gunning for those guys." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre left fielder Fred Lynn: "It's a devastating thing for them. It's 
very disheartening to get swept, especially at home. When you're on the road, 
you can shrug your shoulders and say it's one of those things. But when it 
happens at home, believe me, you start looking for ways to get beat. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have so many ways we can beat you. We can beat you with three singles. 
We can go over the fence. Or we can throw two pitchers at you at one time." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, things are going so good for the Padres these days that they actually have 
people fighting to get on the mound for saves. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who Friday forgot how many outs there were in the second inning, 
and Saturday had two different players picked off base in the fourth inning, 
pulled off a slapstick routine in the ninth Sunday that's bound to find its way 
on blooper films for years. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Greg Harris was walking from the dugout to the mound for the bottom of 
the ninth -- concentrating on what he needed to do to protect the lead provided 
by Benito Santiago's two-run homer in the top of the inning -- when he looked 
up, startled. 
</P>
<P>
There on the mound, already with the ball in his hand, was reliever Craig 
Lefferts, who had sprinted from the bullpen. They looked at one another, and 
for a moment, were too stunned to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Harris: "What's up, I thought I was pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts: "Oh, no, I thought I was." 
</P>
<P>
So they both turned around simultaneously to the dugout, looking for a way to 
get out of this mess. 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson pointed to his right arm, signaling that Harris 
would remain the pitcher. A funny look spread across Lefferts' face, and his 
mind raced trying to figure out what to do next, and then he took off running 
back to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very embarrassing," Lefferts said. "I can't even tell you what 
the fans said, because I couldn't bear to listen. I won't hear the end of this 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Said center fielder Joe Carter, walking by: "So Lefty, what's the deal, you got 
a clause in your contract for incentives or something?" 
</P>
<P>
And Lynn: "When I saw them both on the mound, I said, 'Well, I guess Lefty's 
going to manage, too. If he's not going to get the call, he'll just call 
himself.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ah, when you're winning games like the Padres, who were trailing 3-2 into the 
eighth inning in each of the three games at Candlestick, and have scored 16 of 
their 21 runs this season after the seventh, you can afford to have levity in 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how much fun we're having," said Parent, who went two for 
three with an RBI in his first start of the season. "This whole series was a 
blast." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who unanimously despise Candlestick Park more than any other in the 
league, could hardly believe the way they were feeling Sunday when they boarded 
the team bus to the airport. In less than 48 hours, they became the first team 
since the New York Mets in 1987 to sweep a series at Candlestick, and they 
could not have designed a more tortuous way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to win a game 10-0," Parent said, "but there was something special 
about these games. It's more fun to let them think they're going to win, and 
then come back from behind and take it away from them. 
</P>
<P>
"It really made us feel good to see them (the Giants) crawl back into their 
little hole." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn: "All of them were nice, but this one was 
the best, because it sure didn't look too good. I thought this one was a 
goner." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who had not reached second base since the sixth inning off starter 
Rick Reuschel, had to face Giants' bullpen stopper Steve Bedrosian for the 
ninth. Bedrosian had left the team Tuesday night to be with his 2 1/2-year-old 
son, who was diagnosed Friday with leukemia. This would be his 1990 debut. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 29,339, who were well-aware of Bedrosian's troubles, gave him a 
loud, rousing ovation when he came to the mound. This is what they were 
awaiting. Now their bullpen problems would be solved. 
</P>
<P>
But yet, the trauma and sleepless nights had taken their toll on Bedrosian. 
This was not the same Steve Bedrosian they were used to seeing. This man had 
more problems on his mind than the location of his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way I could block it out," Bedrosian said. "I thought about it, 
and I also had my mind on getting the hitters out. It was tough being out 
there. I hurt more than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who was dropped to sixth in the lineup with his .120 batting average, 
strode to the plate as the leadoff hitter. He then stopped, and nodded to 
Bedrosian. "I wanted to pay my respects, and let him know I was feeling for 
him," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
He then lined the second pitch under the glove of third baseman Matt Williams 
for a double. Garry Templeton then made sure to move Carter to third by 
grounding out to the right side of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Santiago. This was supposed to be his off-day. But he entered the 
game in the seventh as a pinch-runner for Parent, and here he was, taking his 
first cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian blew a slider past Santiago on the first pitch, and on the second 
pitch, threw another slider, which Santiago barely was able to foul off. 
</P>
<P>
"After that second pitch, I had to step out and clear my head," Santiago said. 
"He really had me confused." 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian then tried to cross him up by throwing a fastball over the middle of 
the plate. It didn't work. Santiago sent it soaring over the left-field fence, 
some 400 feet away, for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a mistake pitch," Santiago said. "And the way I hit it, I'm 
sure it was." 
</P>
<P>
All the Padres needed to do now was stop the Giants in the bottom of the ninth, 
and once they determined who would pitch the ninth, it was easy. Harris retired 
the side 1-2-3, picking up his second victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who has appeared or warmed up in every game, pitched three perfect 
innings. For the season, he has allowed just two hits and one walk in nine 
innings, facing just 28 batters. 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, and the bullpen was supposed to be the Padres' weakness, after losing Cy 
Young award winner Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any doubt in my mind we'd pick up the slack," Dobson said. 
"I'm sure people thought we'd be in big trouble when we lost Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what they're thinking now?" 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' last three-game sweep at Candlestick Park was July 25-27, 1982, 
when Juan Eichelberger, Eric Show and Tim Lollar were the winning pitchers. . . 
. Padre third base Coach Sandy Alomar was ejected from the game with two outs 
in the ninth inning by first base umpire Dana DeMuth for arguing a strike call 
while the Giants were batting. . . . Padre reliever Craig Lefferts received his 
1989 championship ring along with the rest of the Giants in a pre-game 
ceremony. . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon was returning to the team hotel after 
mass Saturday night when a street person stopped him for a handout. "Hey, 
buddy, I just gave you money when I walked this way before," McKeon said. 
"Besides, I'm working this side of the street now. You got the other side." . . 
. Benito Santiago was stopped before the game by a little boy, requesting his 
autograph. He began to sign when Santiago suddenly realized it was a baseball 
card of teammate Fred Lynn. Santiago handed the card back to the boy, who said, 
"Well, can I just have your batting gloves then?" Santiago was laughing too 
hard to respond. . . . Giant reliever Dan Quisenberry on Will Clark's 
concentration at the plate: "The more I watch him, the more I swear I'm looking 
at George Brett. . . . McKeon on reliever Greg Harris, who has either warmed up 
or pitched in every game this season: "He's a bulldog. I came in the other 
morning, looked in the shower room, and there he was doing pushups. And when 
he's not doing pushups, he's lifting dumbbells." . . . Giant starter Rick 
Reuschel continued his dominance of Jack Clark, striking him out three times 
and inducing a fly ball to left field. Clark is batting just .127 (seven for 
55) with just one homer and 19 strikeouts. . . . McKeon, who got his last 
position player in the game Sunday when catcher Mark Parent started for 
Santiago, said he also is making plans to give himself a little time off. 
McKeon plans to travel to Las Vegas after the Padres' May 16 afternoon game 
against Philadelphia, where he'll also have a chance to see their triple-A club 
that night and May 17, and then do the same June 6-7. He also is tentatively 
planning to scout the Detroit Tigers tFayetteville, Ark. club June 21, an 
off-day before the Padres play in Atlanta. There's a certain catcher playing 
for Fayetteville who McKeon has long admired, but never seen play a 
professional game. He's Kasey McKeon, McKeon's son. . . . The Padres will play 
a four-inning simulated game on their off-day today in Cincinnati in which Mike 
Dunne will pitch. Dunne then likely will make three more starts before the 
Padres will ask him to accept a rehabilitation assignment in triple-A Las Vegas 
for 30 days. Dunne, who was selected by the Padres in the major league draft 
when he was left unprotected by the Seattle Mariners, has the option of 
refusing the assignment and electing to become a free agent. If he accepts the 
assignment, the Padres must put him on their 24-man roster after 30 days or 
offer him back to the Mariners. "If he's healthy, we'll keep him," McKeon said. 
"If he's not, we'll probably give him back to the Mariners. . . . The Padres 
will open a two-game series in Cincinnati beginning Tuesday. Padre Andy Benes 
(1-0) and Tom Browning (1-0) are the scheduled pitchers Tuesday, and Padre 
Dennis Rasmussen (0-0) and Danny Jackson (0-0) are scheduled Wednesday.

FIGHTING SOCKERS BEATEN BY ST. LOUIS IN OVERTIME 
</P>

ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers blew an opportunity to gain home field advantage for the first 
round of the MISL playoffs when rookie Dan Donigan scored his second goal of 
the season 5:30 into overtime Sunday night to give the St. Louis Storm a 2-1 
victory at St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had problems before even leaving for St. Louis. Midfielder Brian 
Quinn didn't make the trip because his wife, Sharon, who is seven months 
pregnant, suffered an appendicitis attack on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Problems continued in St. Louis. At the conclusion of the second quarter, 
midfielder Waad Hirmez and Socker Coach Ron Newman had words while going off 
the field and butted heads. Hirmez didn't play the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (23-27) then tired in the second half after tying the game, 1-1. 
With the victory, St. Louis (23-27) clinched the season series five games to 
three and moved into a tie with the Sockers for second place in the Western 
Division. A Socker victory would have given them home field advantage for their 
five-game Western Division semifinal playoff series with the Storm. Each team 
has two games remaining. St. Louis will have home field advantage if the teams 
are tied at the conclusion of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The winning goal was set up when forward Michael Collins picked up the ball at 
midfield and hit forward Claudio De Oliveira outside the penalty box. De 
Oliveira drew defender Ralph Black to him and passed to Donigan, who tapped a 
shot past goalie Zoltan Toth. 
</P>
<P>
"It almost looked like the old San Diego Traders," Newman said. "We had a lot 
of developmental players on the field. We tired in the second half. The boys 
played their guts out, but we came up short. That's been our story all year." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez wouldn't comment on his differences with Newman. Newman told Hirmez near 
the end of the half that he needed to get back on defense more quickly. The two 
argued and were eventually separated by several players. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pure case of insubordination, plain and simple," Newman said. "I'm 
the boss and he didn't agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers tied the game 8:56 into the fourth quarter when forward Damir 
Haramina scored his fifth goal of the season. Branko Segota knocked a pass off 
the boards, and Haramina beat goalie Slobo Ilijevski. 
</P>
<P>
Segota almost won the game with 50 seconds remaining, blasting a shot from 
outside the penalty box that Ilijevski punched wide. 
</P>
<P>
"Slobo played great," Storm Coach Don Popovic said. "He has played well against 
San Diego all year. The guy is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Segota also had a good chance to score in overtime, but Ilijevski came out of 
the goal to stop him point blank. On the rebound, forward Jim Gabarra shot from 
midfield and Ilijevski dived backward to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off poor and we looked tired," Newman said. "I kept telling the 
guys to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Thompson Usiyan put St. Louis in front, 1-0, with 3:34 remaining in the 
third quarter. De Oliveira hit a pass near the midfield to Usiyan, who lofted a 
soft shot over Toth's right shoulder into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team had many scoring chances in the second quarter. Socker forward Rod 
Castro opened the quarter hitting the post from 20 yards. Segota raced down the 
left sideline late in the quarter and fired a shot off Socker defender Ralph 
Black that Ilijevski caught. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had virtually no offense in the first quarter. The Storm opened the 
game with good scoring chances from Marcio Leite and Godfrey Ingram. Leite hit 
the far right post on one shot, and Toth stopped Ingram twice inside the box 
within a matter of seconds.

HAVOC TO S.F. BAY POSSIBLE DUE TO BIG RISE IN SEAS; 
</P>
<P>

COULD DEVASTATE BAY AREA, A WORST-CASE SCENARIO ASSERTS.

Rising seas caused by warmth trapped in polluted air could inundate $48 billion 
worth of property along San Francisco Bay over the next century unless 
preventive action is taken, a Berkeley research organization estimates in a 
report released today. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect, projected by the 
nonprofit Pacific Institute, is a worst-case scenario based on a one-meter rise 
in sea level from melting land ice and expansion of the oceans themselves as 
they warm. 
</P>
<P>
Recent research predicting a rise of only about one foot, less than a third of 
a meter, would reduce the impact predicted by the report, which suggests all of 
California would have to undertake a massive construction job to preserve its 
current coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of protecting against a sea rise of half a meter isn't that much 
different from protecting against a full meter," said Peter H. Gleick, author 
of the report with Edwin P. Maurer. "Besides, a prediction of a 30-centimeter 
rise (roughly one foot) by 2050 doesn't mean the sea would stop (rising) there. 
That kind of rise is consistent with a full meter by the end of the (21st) 
century." 
</P>
<P>
Even at much lower increases of six inches or less, Gleick and Maurer project 
more frequent severe storms that would lash shoreline property if not inundate 
it. A storm that today would be considered the worst in a century would happen 
once a decade if the sea level rises just half a foot, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"A sea-level rise will irrevocably change the nature of San Francisco Bay. It's 
a no-win situation," Gleick said. "Even if we were to build all of the levees 
and seawalls needed to protect existing development, we would lose vast 
stretches of wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
Predictions of massive disruption to coastal zones have usually accompanied 
projections by most scientists of how the greenhouse effect will nudge average 
temperatures up by anywhere from four to nine degrees Fahrenheit over the next 
100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other 
government and private research agencies think that small but critical warming 
may have some benefits -- increased food production, quicker forest growth and 
increased fresh water supplies. But it will come at a massive cost of flooding 
along coastlines, where half of the world's population lives. 
</P>
<P>
In its study, the Pacific Institute applied those expectations to a specific, 
known region -- San Francisco Bay, which as the nation's second-largest estuary 
has a large part of its population living near the water and has particular 
economic and ecological importance to California. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious effect is a great expansion of land area subject to floods 
under highest tide. San Francisco International Airport would be in danger, as 
would highly developed areas of San Mateo County, including NASA Ames Research 
Center and Moffett Field Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay, Oakland International Airport probably would be swamped, as 
would large parts of Oakland itself. Treasure Island, an artificial island 
housing a Navy base in the middle of the bay, would vanish. So, too, would 
several other military installations, including the Alameda Naval Air Station, 
Oakland Army Terminal and U.S. Coast Guard Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, the Sears Point Raceway and the abandoned Hamilton Air Force 
Base would be affected. Parts of the cities of Napa, Vallejo and Fairfield 
could be washed out. 
</P>
<P>
People who avoid flooding from the high tides would not be able to avoid the 
deterioration of the region's ground water basins due to sea-water intrusion. 
Nor would they be likely to escape sharing in the cost of erecting seawalls and 
levees to shield low-lying areas from the rising ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Gleick and Maurer estimate the cost of building seawalls and levees, or 
modifying existing ones, at $942 million. Maintaining those defenses, they add, 
could run as high as $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
To minimize the impact of rising seas, the researchers suggest an immediate 
prohibition of development along the coast and adjacent marshes, tidelands and 
other wetland areas. Flood insurance programs should be modified or phased out 
in areas likely to be affected by future flooding, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Even with such adjustments, the dislocation caused by significant sea level 
change will, over time, be substantial, Gleick and Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the impacts of a sea-level rise may never be quantifiable," they said. 
"These include . . . social costs of migration away from affected areas, the 
psychological pressures of living behind coastal protection in threatened areas 
(and) the value of lost or altered ecosystems." 
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse Effect Flood Threat 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the potential problem posed throughout California if the heat 
trapped in polluted air causes sea level to rise. Berkeley's Pacific Institute 
mapped out Bay Area land subject to floods by a one-meter (3.3-foot) increase. 
This is based on early estimates of rising seas and is considered a worst-case 
scenario. Some scientists believe global warming may cause a rise of only one 
foot at most over the next century.

POPE REJOICES AT DEMOCRACY'S RISE;

EASTER: JOHN PAUL II HAILS THE FALL OF 'GODLESS IDEOLOGIES' AND SENDS WORDS OF 
HOPE TO LITHUANIA.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a powerful and upbeat message to cheering Easter pilgrims, Pope John Paul II 
on Sunday hailed the "reawakening of many democracies" that have suffered war 
and dictatorship waged "in the name of godless ideologies." 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of brightly clad worshipers defied glowering skies to attend 
a papal Mass on the flower-dressed steps of St. Peter's Basilica, followed by 
John Paul's first "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) Easter message 
since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While making plain his satisfaction with moves toward peace there, the Pope 
also echoed one of his favorite themes, telling rich nations that their wealth 
and freedom carries with them the moral obligation to aid the world's have-not 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
"Let yourselves be convinced that there can be no freedom where misery 
continues to exist," the Pope bluntly declared in ceremonies broadcast to more 
than 50 countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
In a special greeting delivered in Lithuanian, the Pope prayed for peace in the 
breakaway Soviet republic with the hope that the will of the people there "will 
be confirmed through respectful and comprehensive dialogue." On Saturday, John 
Paul cabled Lithuania's Cardinal Vicentas Sladkevicius expressing support in 
"these hours of trepidation and hope." 
</P>
<P>
For the polyglot ceremony marking the Resurrection of Jesus, the holiest feast 
day for the world's 850 million Roman Catholics, the 69-year-old Pope preached 
from the Gospel of St. John (16:33): "I have overcome the world!" 
</P>
<P>
"Only the risen Christ can fully satisfy your irrepressible yearning for 
freedom," John Paul said, addressing people "of our time." 
</P>
<P>
As fat, cold drops of rain began to sprinkle the crowd, the Pope applauded 
progress of human beings toward burying their violent past. 
</P>
<P>
"After the horrors of two world wars and all the (other) wars which in these 
last 60 years, often in the name of godless ideologies, have reaped the harvest 
of victims and sewn hatred in so many nations . . . the true dimensions of the 
spirit have been discovered anew," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today as well," John Paul continued, "the awakening of many democracies is 
leading to dialogue and trust between peoples; and the world is coming to 
understand once again that man cannot live without God." 
</P>
<P>
Stressing the internationality of John Paul's concerns, participants in his 
Easter Mass addressed the giant crowd in Italian, Spanish, English, Albanian, 
Polish, Portuguese, German and French. After his address, the Pope delivered 
his customary Easter greetings in all of those languages and more than two 
dozen others, ranging from Croatian to Thai, from Hebrew to Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
"A blessed Easter in the joy of Jesus Christ, the risen Lord and Savior of the 
world," he said in English. 
</P>
<P>
Respectful pilgrims from Poland and other Eastern European countries mixed in 
the giant plaza before St. Peter's with richer West Europeans and the African 
and Filipino residents who give a Third World flavor to many corners of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul recalled his exhausting January trip to five of the poorest nations 
on earth, in Africa's Sahel region. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in the Sahel, and I have seen the sand burying villages, drying up 
wells, burning the eyes, turning children into skeletons . . . as it brings 
desperation, starvation, sickness and death -- death from hunger and thirst," 
the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again in his African trip, John Paul urged that Third World needs not 
be overlooked in the rush to aid emerging democracies in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, with the graphic account of the suffering he had witnessed in Africa, 
John Paul spoke directly once again to "wealthy nations of the civilization of 
opulence." 
</P>
<P>
"Do not be indifferent to this great tragedy," he pleaded. "Let human and 
Christian solidarity be the challenge that provokes your conscience. . ." 
</P>
<P>
John Paul's twin concerns for the development of democracy in Eastern Europe 
and the fight against hunger in poor southern nations will be reflected in his 
remaining trips this year. On Saturday, he leaves for a two-day visit to 
Czechoslovakia. On May 6, he goes to Mexico, and in the fall he returns to 
Africa.

AMERICAN ALBUM: IN CORNFIELD COUNTRY, GOOD VIBES BY THE BUSHEL

<P>
Things got pretty hectic here on Tranquility Base last week. 
</P>
<P>
There was the seminar for doctors to outline the latest advances in 
maharishi-based medical care. An architectural conference took up principles of 
maharishi-inspired building design. Music lovers swooned to unusual rhythms at 
recitals of maharishi gandharva music, which is said to be completely 
harmonious with nature. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight was the special weeklong "Heaven on Earth" assembly, a 
conclave of 5,000 devotees of transcendental meditation and a mystical theory 
of physics they call the maharishi technology of the unified field. By 
meditating en masse twice a day, they vowed to ease international tensions 
while generating what they refer to as the global maharishi effect -- "an 
upsurge of positivity and progress in world consciousness," as official 
literature describes it. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see the paper today?" asked Patty Schneider, public affairs director 
of Fairfield-based Maharishi International University. "In East Germany they 
apologized to Jews for the Holocaust and a couple of days ago those hostages 
were released in the Mideast. You can't tell me this stuff doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for all this is the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the gnomish Indian 
guru who soared to prominence a few decades ago as a spiritual tutor to The 
Beatles during their psychedelic phase. The maharishi parlayed that fame into a 
richly endowed worldwide network of TM centers and schools designed to promote 
his unorthodox notions about science, medicine, economics, politics and just 
about anything else. 
</P>
<P>
The best known of these institutions is MIU, an 850-student college tucked amid 
the cornfields of southeastern Iowa. Here, the maharishi's followers claim to 
have done extensive scientific research to validate the maharishi effect. They 
contend that concentrations of trained meditators emit a positive force field 
that profoundly affects everything and everybody around them. The bigger the 
group, the wider the impact. 
</P>
<P>
According to the maharishi's calculations, the world's problems could disappear 
if just 7,000 people, about the square root of 1% of Earth's population, would 
meditate together daily. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with an elaborate array of charts, graphs and stupefying mathematical 
formulas, officials say that previous mass meditation experiments both here and 
abroad have produced traceable reductions in crime, traffic accidents, illness 
and hostility while pushing up the stock market and even improving the weather. 
</P>
<P>
The thaw in East-West tensions? Thank the maharishi, not Gorbachev, they argue. 
The success of Reaganomics? Meditation, not voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
The theory may need a little fine-tuning. With the Philippines racked by 
political turmoil and economic collapse back in 1984, about 1,200 of the 
maharishi's followers from Europe and the United States descended on Manila and 
vowed to meditate away the country's woes. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony at the presidential palace, they declared then-President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, "the founding father and mother" of 
their movement as well as bestowing on Mrs. Marcos the "crown of consciousness 
of the royal order of the age of enlightenment." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, while the group was in the Philippines the country was rocked by 
a devastating typhoon, a strong earthquake and a life-threatening volcanic 
eruption. Meanwhile, inflation soared to 60% and several anti-government 
demonstrations resulted in serious street violence. 
</P>
<P>
One place where the maharishi effect is undeniable is Fairfield, a community of 
11,000 that is thriving thanks in part to the influx of maharishi acolytes. 
While most Iowa towns shrunk during the farm crisis of the last decade, 
Fairfield grew. Several times a year the town's population soars and cash 
registers ring wildly as American and Canadian meditators flock here by the 
thousands for periodic assemblies called to enhance the maharishi effect. 
</P>
<P>
Movement officials recently purchased ads in dozens of newspapers around the 
globe offering an incredible bargain to President Bush and other world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
To create a permanent global maharishi effect, the governments were asked to 
underwrite the hiring of 10,000 full-time meditators -- a few thousand more 
than needed just in case some of the regulars got sick or went on vacation. 
With the maharishi effect in place, most nations could slash their military and 
domestic budgets because people wouldn't have many problems anymore, the 
reasoning goes. 
</P>
<P>
"For $100 million a year we could create an enormous effect on the whole 
world," said Bevan Morris, MIU's president. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster their claims, MIU researchers plan to measure problems around the 
world immediately before, during and after the latest assembly, which concluded 
Sunday. As the meditators head home today, tensions and anxieties should rise, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, at least, such a prediction will almost surely prove 
true. Millions of Americans face the most nerve-racking, gut-wrenching task of 
the year today -- meeting the midnight deadline for filing their annual income 
tax statements.

Today, as the deadline arrives for filing federal income tax returns, Americans 
with the highest incomes are paying a smaller share of their income than they 
did 10 years ago. Paradoxically, they also account for a greater share of total 
tax payments now than they did in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: The taxable incomes of the most affluent Americans grew so 
handsomely that lower tax rates yield more total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Those with low incomes are paying a higher share of what they earn to the IRS, 
but their incomes rose so slowly in the 1980s that their taxes now make up a 
smaller share of total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The two tables show the tax-paying population divided into five equal segments, 
from poorest to richest, then additionally into the richest 10% and richest 5%. 
All federal taxes, most notably the income and Social Security taxes, are 
included.

Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, in Jerusalem with a Senate delegation on a 
Middle East tour, urged Israel to move toward peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
He said American public support for the Jewish state diminishes with every 
report of violence in the two-year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied 
areas. "It's sort of Vietnam all over again. People watch television, they see 
what's happening in the intifada (uprising), they don't like it," Dole said, 
recalling how the media helped turn U.S. public opinion against the Vietnam 
War.

NASA on Sunday installed a new power unit in the space shuttle Discovery and 
began recharging the batteries of the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is scheduled to lift off with the $1.5-billion telescope on April 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now everything seems to be in the bag for a week from Wednesday," said 
George Diller, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians on Saturday took out a faulty auxiliary power unit that forced a 
scrub of Discovery's launching last Tuesday. A new unit was then installed, the 
first time the procedure has been performed at the launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's payload bay doors were opened on Saturday and Hubble's six 
nickel-hydrogen batteries were removed for a 130-hour recharging that began 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
NASA decided to take the batteries to the laboratory because they can be 
recharged at a cooler temperature than at the launch pad, and thus retain more 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle's three auxiliary power units pressurize the hydraulic system used 
to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking and steering system. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians closed Discovery's payload bay doors Sunday after the batteries 
were removed. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber will remain sealed to reduce the risk of getting dust on the 
telescope's mirror until the batteries are reinstalled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Once in orbit, the telescope named for American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble will 
enable astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has 
been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.

SCHOOL CRIME REPORT FINDINGS IN DOUBT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HOW PRINCIPALS APPROACH DISCIPLINE MAY 
SKEW THE FIGURES. 
</P>

<P>
Discrepancies in the way individual schools report crime raise doubts about the 
accuracy of the state's statistics on crime in Los Angeles city schools, 
according to police, education officials and records obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The state's report on campus crime, scheduled for release Tuesday, is expected 
to show increases in the number of assaults at Los Angeles city schools during 
the 1988-89 school year. But education experts say significant differences in 
how school principals approach student discipline may skew those figures one 
way or another. 
</P>
<P>
Some administrators favor the arrest of students suspected of minor crimes, 
while others are more likely to impose punishments such as detention, litter 
pickup or suspension, actions that allow crimes to go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
There are, for example, large and surprising differences in the number of 
assaults reported at San Fernando Valley high schools during the 1988-89 school 
year, according to figures obtained directly from school police. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park High School reported no assaults on any of its 2,000 students or 
staff. San Fernando High School reported three assaults. By comparison, Grant 
High School in Van Nuys reported 17 assaults and Taft High School in Woodland 
Hills reported 20 assaults. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine any metropolitan high school having no assaults," said Grant 
assistant principal Daniel Gruenberg, who is in charge of student discipline. 
"Either they have chosen not to report them or there is a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park High School Principal Charles Molina said the reason for his 
school's clean record is that "the kids get along very well." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department Detective Stan Miller, who works in the 
jurisdiction responsible for juvenile crimes in Canoga Park, credited the 
school with good security and rapport between students and the resident school 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "knowing that area and the ethnic mix of the students, I am sure 
that there are some fights on campus . . . but we have no statistics to back 
that up." 
</P>
<P>
Assaults reported at San Fernando High School dropped from 18 to three and 
total reported crime was cut nearly in half since Bart Kricorian took over as 
principal in 1984. "Nothing magical in what we are doing," he said. "Students 
know we are tough in our discipline." 
</P>
<P>
The report by the state Department of Education tabulates assaults against 
students and school employees, as well as property crimes such as theft, 
burglary and vandalism. In all, 22 categories of crime were measured for every 
California public school and compiled into county and school district totals. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the state crime survey, established by the Legislature in 1984, 
is to help the public to assess the safety of its schools. 
</P>
<P>
But the numbers supplied to the state by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District are often the product of reporting standards that vary, sometimes 
dramatically, from school to school. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no method or section in the law that allows anybody at the state to 
require uniformity among schools," said Bill Rukeyser, a spokesman for the 
state Department of Education. "Local standards determine what gets reported. 
One school writes up graffiti as a case of vandalism and another school 
classifies it as a part of daily life and it never gets into the books." 
</P>
<P>
Even school police differ in the way they react to campus crimes, district 
officials say. Although district policy requires the arrest of students 
suspected of committing felony crimes, such as armed assault, lesser crimes are 
sometimes left unreported by officers who dislike the paper work involved, as 
well as the long waits needed to process suspects, district administrators and 
police officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Some officers may see something as an assault that needs to be reported, while 
others may see the same thing as a tiff between two students that need not be 
listed," said Harriet Williams, administrator of operations for the district's 
senior high school division and a 37-year district veteran. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD Detective Miller, who is in charge of the juvenile unit at West Valley 
Division, said the decision to seek formal charges against students suspected 
of crimes is similar to choices faced by others in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no different than a Los Angeles policeman and how many tickets they 
write," Miller said. "It's how they want to write them. Some don't like writing 
tickets and some will write up anything that moves. Some school administrators 
and police officers are the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an unknown number of students who are victims of crime fail to press 
charges because they fear retaliation from their assailants, district Police 
Chief Wesley C. Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"With no victim, there is no crime," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the differences in the number of crimes reported at high 
schools with similar numbers of students can be dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Reported property crimes -- including vandalism, arson, burglary and theft -- 
range from a low of 12 at Canoga Park High School to 79 at Cleveland High 
School in Reseda during the 1988-89 school year, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
Taft High School, in an upper-middle-class section of the Valley, reported 17 
incidents involving possession of weapons during the 1988-89 school year. 
Canoga and North Hollywood high schools reported one such incident each during 
the same school year. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles district officials say they have compiled a more accurate -- and 
frightening -- measure of the rise in campus violence than the state crime 
survey. They report that 438 students were punished for bringing weapons to 
school or assaulting someone with a weapon at school during the 1988-89 school 
year, a 29.5% increase over the previous year when 338 such cases were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Concern by parents, teachers and students over increasing school crime erupted 
last year in the wake of the classroom stabbing of a junior high school English 
teacher by one of her students in Sylmar. A month earlier a teacher in La 
Crescenta disarmed a 13-year-old boy who waved a loaded .357 magnum in class. 
</P>
<P>
Those incidents prompted the appointment of a district committee to study 
campus violence. In a report issued last month, the committee was especially 
critical of the low percentage of students expelled after being caught with 
weapons at school. Almost all of the students were given a second chance at 
another school. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education is expected to hold a hearing on the report's 
recommendations today, but it is unlikely that the financially strapped 
district of 610,000 students can afford to do much more about school crime. 
</P>
<P>
Budget officials have recommended that the board cut 10 school police positions 
and eliminate jobs for 93 campus security aides, an estimated savings of $1.48 
million. So far, the board has approved $113 million of $170 million in cuts 
that budget officials estimate are needed to balance the district's 1990-91 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks, especially in campus security, come as more and more students 
experience the effects of campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the increase in armed assaults during the 1988-89 school year, the 
state report will show an increase in overall crime at the district's junior 
high schools, said the district's police chief, who described them as the 
"leading grade configuration for social deviancy." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discrepancies, improvements in the crime reporting system -- 
prompted by criticism from district police chiefs including Mitchell -- were 
put into place last July for the 1989-90 school year, state officials said. One 
of the changes separates assaults from schoolyard fights. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said improvements in coming years to the reporting system will 
make the annual survey more useful in comparing district crime rates. For now, 
the statistics are useful only for tracking changes from year to year at 
individual schools and school districts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a supposition that if a school or a district applies one yardstick to 
reporting in 1988, chances are it is going to use the same yardstick in 1989," 
said Rukeyser. "But that isn't guaranteed either."

The concentration of harmful ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere has more 
than doubled in the last 100 years, and it will likely rise at an even faster 
rate in the next 30 years, researchers said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Britain's Harwell Laboratory said recent measurements of 
ground-level ozone indicate that levels of the gas are, on the average, twice 
as high as recorded by French researchers in Paris in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
When it is in the upper atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from the sun's 
ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and other health problems. But 
when found near ground level, the highly corrosive form of oxygen can cause 
respiratory distress. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is formed through complex 
reactions with nitrogen oxide and other chemicals found in automobile and 
industrial emissions containing nitrogen oxide. 
</P>
<P>
Based on projected increases in nitrogen oxide emissions, researchers said 
their computer simulations show that between now and 2020, concentrations of 
ground-level or, "tropospheric," ozone will rise "at a rate faster than during 
the past 100 years." In fact, the study, in the journal Nature, found the 
increase in tropospheric ozone during the next 30 years could equal that for 
the entire last century.

WOMEN RUN GREATER RISK IN HEART BYPASS SURGERY; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: TWICE AS MANY DIE ON THE OPERATING TABLE. STUDY BLAMES A TENDENCY 
AMONG DOCTORS TO IGNORE SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Women are nearly twice as likely as men to die from a common form of coronary 
artery surgery -- a fact that researchers now suspect reflects a tendency among 
physicians to neglect heart disease symptoms in women. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Los Angeles, in findings published this week in the Annals of 
Internal Medicine, have found that women are generally older and sicker than 
men when they are referred for coronary artery bypass surgery, apparently 
because doctors tend to take women's symptoms less seriously than men's. 
</P>
<P>
And that difference in age and degree of sickness at the time of surgery 
explains women's higher risk of dying from the operation, the researchers 
found. Their smaller size is not responsible for the increased risk, as had 
been thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, I think, physicians are trying to prove that women don't have coronary 
disease," said Dr. Steven S. Khan of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "It's in the 
teaching of cardiology, that chest pain (in women) is most likely due to 
something other than the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Khan's findings refocus attention on the shifting demographics of heart disease 
in the United States -- in this case, the rising incidence of coronary disease 
in women as the population ages and lifestyles change. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette smoking and job stress are among the factors that put many women at a 
greater risk of coronary artery disease than in the past. And as the population 
ages, there are more and more women in the older age bracket in which women 
tend to come down with symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors should have a greater awareness of the potential for serious cardiac 
illness in women," said Dr. Richard J. Gray, one of the study's co-authors. 
"And women themselves should feel less complacent about their freedom from 
heart disease." 
</P>
<P>
Khan, Gray and four other researchers at Cedars-Sinai and UCLA reviewed the 
cases of 2,297 patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery, a 
procedure used to circumvent a narrowed or blocked artery by grafting on other 
blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Four out of five of the patients were men. But the women were much more likely 
to die from the operation. The researchers found that 4.6% of the women and 
2.6% of the men died in the operating room or within the following month. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the women were more than four years older than the men. They were 
also sicker. More of the women had been referred because of heart failure or 
other serious symptoms, while more of the men had been referred simply after a 
worrisome exercise stress test. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, women were referred significantly more often than men with severe 
symptoms of coronary disease," the researchers wrote. Coronary disease occurs 
when cholesterol-laden fatty deposits narrow the coronary arteries, limiting 
blood flow to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
There may be other consequences of delayed referral beyond the risk of death. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers noted that one type of bypass grafting believed to be more 
reliable in the long run is not advisable in emergencies or in older patients. 
For that reason, they said, women may be receiving less effective treatment. 
</P>
<P>
As for why physicians might wait longer to refer women for surgery, Khan and 
Gray noted that tests for diagnosing coronary artery disease are less reliable 
in women than in men. Furthermore, physicians generally believe women are at 
less risk than men: Men are six to eight times more likely to develop heart 
disease than pre-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
But after menopause, women lose the innate protection conferred by hormones. By 
age 65 to 70, their risk is about equal to that of men, said Gray, director of 
surgical cardiology at Cedars-Sinai and a professor of medicine at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
As the population ages, physicians will be seeing more and more women in that 
age bracket, the researchers said. They said it is no longer appropriate to 
automatically assume that complaints such as chest pain are traceable to 
sources other than the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that women are smoking more and may be exposed to more of the stresses and 
factors that in men cause coronary disease, they need to be aware that the 
symptoms they are having may be due to significant blockages in their heart," 
Khan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their physicians should be aware of that, too," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The study did not explore whether women would be better off with earlier 
surgery, but Khan said there is reason to suspect they would. However, he said 
it is also possible that some men are being referred too early, before they 
really need the operation.

EGGSHELLS MAY HELP CRACK MYSTERIES OF HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: A NEW TECHNIQUE USING SHELLS CAN DETERMINE THE AGE OF A SITE UNDER 
STUDY. THE METHOD HAS ALREADY DETERMINED MODERN HUMANS EXISTED IN AFRICA FAR 
EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED.

<P>
Ostrich eggshells are among the most commonly found objects at archeological 
sites in Africa. Primitive humans used the eggs as food and the shells for 
water containers, bowls and beads. 
</P>
<P>
Now, archeologists may find them even more valuable for understanding the 
history of early humans. 
</P>
<P>
A team of researchers headed by paleoanthropologist Allison S. Brooks of George 
Washington University and geophysicist P. Edward Hare of the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington reported recently in the journal Science that the 
slow decomposition of proteins in the eggshells can be used to date 
archeological sites, particularly in the range of 40,000 to 100,000 years ago 
-- a period for which there are few usable dating techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies with ostrich-eggshell dating at two African sites indicate 
that modern humans were present earlier than had previously been believed. 
</P>
<P>
One particular advantage of the new technique is that it is inexpensive, so 
that a large number of objects at a site can be dated to determine if artifacts 
from different time periods have been jumbled together by weather, flooding or 
excavations -- a problem that occurs frequently. "That is one of the things I 
am most excited about," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggshell dating relies on a physical process called amino acid racemization. 
Amino acids are the individual molecules from which proteins are formed. In 
nature, virtually all amino acids are present in only one of two possible 
spatial configurations, called D and L, that have a three-dimensional 
relationship to each other, similar to the relationship of the right hand to 
the left. 
</P>
<P>
After an animal's death, the L amino acids will slowly undergo a chemical 
change to the D-form until a 50-50 mixture of the two forms is present. The 
rate of this change is constant at any temperature, so by measuring the ratio 
of D and L amino acids, researchers can determine how long ago the organism 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers such as Jeffrey Bada of the Scripps Oceanographic Institution in La 
Jolla originally tried to use this technique to date human and animal bones, 
but they encountered great difficulties. Indigenous amino acids are readily 
leached out of the bones by water, and the bones are easily contaminated by 
amino acids from other sources. Hence, the technique produces unreliable dates 
and it has been largely discredited. 
</P>
<P>
The Science paper thus represents a rebirth of sorts for the technique. 
</P>
<P>
The chief advantage of the eggshells is that the protein they contained is 
locked into position by the mineral portion of the shell, so it does not easily 
leach out and contaminants do not easily get in. 
</P>
<P>
Hare and his colleagues have done a series of tests with contemporary ostrich 
eggshells, heating them in the absence of water and determining the rate at 
which one amino acid, called L-isoleucine, is converted into its D analog. They 
found that this racemization reaction proceeds at a steady, predictable rate 
that can be used for dating as long as it is compared to materials of known age 
at a given site. 
</P>
<P>
In the tropics, Brooks and Hare report, the technique can be used to date 
objects as old as 200,000 years. In cooler climates, such as China, it can be 
used on objects 1 million years old. 
</P>
<P>
The team has already been using the technique at African sites. At Ashango in 
Zaire, for example, researchers have excavated skeletal fragments "which are 
essentially similar to skeletons of modern East Africans, so they were thought 
to be fairly recent," Brooks said. Dating of eggshells found with them, 
however, shows that the bones are at least 25,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologist Gifford H. Miller of the University of Colorado in Boulder, who 
is also a member of the team, has been studying the remains of unquestionably 
modern humans taken from the Border Cave on the east coast of South Africa. He 
found that the eggshells from the site were about 77,000 years old, providing 
strong additional evidence that modern humans originated in Africa, not on some 
other continent as some researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Although ostriches are most common in Africa, ostrich eggs have also been found 
in China and Mongolia and would be useful for dating there. Moreover, the 
research team has found that every other type of bird egg they have studied 
gives similar results, so those types of shells can be used as well. They are 
now beginning to study owl eggs, which are found at many archeological sites in 
Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Other archeologists are beginning to recognize the importance of the eggshells, 
Miller said. "When I started talking to archeologists, I learned that the 
damned stuff's everywhere," but that people were in the habit of tossing it 
aside as uninteresting. Now, he said, "they are getting keyed in and saving 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DATING TECHNIQUES FOR ARTIFACTS 
</P>
<P>
Carbon-14 dating is good for assesing the age of items from the present to 
40,000 years ago. Another commonly used technique, potassium-argon dating, is 
good for artifacts 300,000 years old or older. Dating of ostrich eggshells can 
fill the gap between and is important because that is a period when modern 
humans were first emerging. It is particularly useful in the range of 40,000 to 
100,000 years ago -- a period for which there are few usable dating techniques. 
In tropic climates, it can be used to date objects as old as 200,000 years. In 
cooler climates, it can be used on objects 1 million years old.

<P>
Women with early ovarian cancer who receive expert care have a much better 
chance of surviving than previously thought, the largest study of the disease 
so far has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Ovarian cancer patients whose tumor is found early apparently can also avoid 
chemotherapy after surgical removal of their tumors without reducing their 
chances of survival, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
The results "finally give us the handle that we've needed in treating early 
stage ovarian cancer," said Dr. Harrison Ball of New England Medical Center in 
Boston, who participated in the research. Previously there was no standard 
approach, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, among those women whose cancer had not spread beyond the 
ovaries and who underwent meticulous medical evaluation, the five-year survival 
rate exceeded 90%. 
</P>
<P>
Previously published survival rates for such patients ranged between 50% and 
70%.

LAKERS PUT THEIR FEAR FAR ASIDE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: CLUB BEATS HOUSTON, 113-102, AND CLINCHES ITS NINTH CONSECUTIVE 
PACIFIC DIVISION TITLE. 
</P>

<P>
Of course, the Lakers will not say they worry about having to play the Houston 
Rockets in the first round of the NBA playoffs, a distinct possibility. 
</P>
<P>
But . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say, you wouldn't want to play against any team with Akeem 
Olajuwon," Laker Coach Pat Riley recently said. 
</P>
<P>
If Sunday night's 113-102 Laker victory over the Rockets is an indicator of 
competition to come, however, then maybe the Lakers' concern is unfounded. They 
treated the Rockets, Olajuwon or no, like any other team struggling to make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In clinching their ninth straight Pacific Division title, which also assured 
them the Western Conference's best record, the Lakers shut down Olajuwon with a 
swarming. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a change from the Lakers' previous three games against the 
Rockets. Houston had beaten the Lakers by 17 and seven points in Houston this 
season, while the Lakers had recorded a hard-fought, nine-point victory at the 
Forum in January. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game, however, was no contest. The Lakers, now winners of 60 games in 
five of the last six seasons, led by as many as 23 points and dominated in 
nearly every facet. They out-rebounded the Rockets, 50-39, and forced the 
Rockets into making only 46.2% of their shots. And, most important, the Lakers' 
double-team of Olajuwon limited the Rocket center to 12 points, only two more 
than his season low. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have rarely played better than they did Sunday. Magic Johnson 
recorded his second straight triple-double, with 25 points 11 rebounds and 11 
assists. James Worthy added 23 points, A.C. Green 16 and 10 rebounds and Mychal 
Thompson had 12 points in his first game back from a right knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Houston dropped to 39-39 and is tied with Seattle for the eighth, and final, 
Western Conference playoff spot. Should the Rockets finish eighth, they will 
play the Lakers again. And, while smarting from the defeat, Rocket Coach Don 
Chaney said his team learned something about the Lakers' defensive tactics 
should the teams meet in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this game was good for us," Chaney said. "We realize now how they 
can take us out of our game. Had we not played them, we might have faced this 
type of (tactic) in the first game of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"They doubled and tripled Akeem and rotated well. We were reluctant to take the 
open jumper, and then we weren't hitting. They made the adjustment on us. So, 
we're next in line to make the adjustment against them -- if there is a next 
time." 
</P>
<P>
While the Rockets' playoff status is tenuous, the Lakers were typically 
unexcited about winning their ninth consecutive Pacific Division title. Asked 
about its significance, Riley pointed behind him to a chalk board with the 
number 1 circled. 
</P>
<P>
"We've still got one more win left for the (NBA's) best record," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (60-18) only need to win one of their remaining four games -- or the 
Detroit Pistons lose another game -- to secure home-court advantage throughout 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good feeling," Johnson said. "But we've still got work to do. It's not 
a feeling of celebration. We have to clinch the best record and then move on 
into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riley: "The Pacific Division is nice. But I can't remember the last time 
we celebrated. Maybe 1983. Not to be smug about it, but (the Lakers) have 
bigger goals to reach." 
</P>
<P>
For at least one Laker, reserve point guard Larry Drew, a division title was an 
achievement to savor. Drew had played eight seasons on losing teams, most 
recently the Clippers, and was about the only elated Laker in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Being associated with something like this, well, this is a great night for 
me," Drew said. "These guys have done it so many times, it's no big deal. This 
is kind of peanuts for them. They are looking beyond this. But this is the 
first time something like this has happened to me. Maybe my wife and child will 
go and have some apple cider." 
</P>
<P>
The game went exactly the way the Lakers had planned. It took two sound road 
beating to the Rockets for the Lakers to develop the right plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was successful," Riley said. "Akeem won't force the issue if you 
double-team him strong. He'll pass off and they weren't hitting the jumpers. 
They handled us twice in a row in Houston. They hammered us on the boards those 
times. But when our physical game is there, we can play with them." 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon seemed so frustrated by the Lakers' defense that he drew a technical 
foul in the second half while sitting on the bench. Afterward, he credited the 
Lakers for his off night. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best defense I've played against all year," Olajuwon said. "Their 
trap in the post was excellent. They were very aggressive. They were coming 
from every angle. I couldn't even see the open man." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' double-teamming of Olajuwon worked as planned in the first half. 
The Rocket center had only four points in the first half -- and it took him 20 
minutes 13 seconds to score. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Rockets stayed within reach of the Lakers, thanks to Otis Thorpe. 
Thorpe, having his way inside because the Lakers were concentrating so much on 
Olajuwon, scored 21 first-half points. Seventeen came in the first quarter and, 
had Thorpe not been in foul trouble, he might have pushed 30 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
When Thorpe was given his first rest 2 1/2 minutes into the second quarter, the 
Lakers had a 37-31 lead. With Olajuwon in, the Rockets stayed close, trailing, 
43-35, when Thorpe came back in with 5:39 to play. But, a minute later, Thorpe 
was out after getting his third foul. He would score only four points in the 
second half.

WITH SAMUEL ON RUN, DODGERS WIN IN 10TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Lasorda has spent the last month telling everyone who would listen that he 
hoped new leadoff hitter Juan Samuel would affect the Dodgers the way a certain 
point guard affects the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him to be our Magic Johnson," Lasorda said of Samuel. "We want him to 
lead our fast break." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing crazier than the analogy is that it is actually making sense. 
Like Sunday, when Samuel led the Dodgers to an overtime 5-4 victory over the 
Houston Astros with a triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
He drew two walks. He scored two runs. And he hit two doubles, including a 
simple base hit that he legged into two bases to start the 10th inning. He 
moved to third on Willie Randolph's sacrifice bunt, and scored the winning run 
on Charley Kerfeld's wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'll be Magic Johnson," Samuel said afterward with a broad smile. "I 
love Magic Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Like Magic, Samuel had plenty of help on this afternoon, particularly from No. 
2 hitter Willie Randolph, who had three runs batted in with two singles and his 
first home run. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's Magic Johnson, that must make me Michael Cooper," Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
It was certainly a prime-time sort of afternoon in front of 13,402 at the 
Astrodome. The Dodgers trailed, 3-0, before much of the Easter Sunday crowd had 
found its seats, thanks to Bill Doran's three-run homer off Tim Belcher in the 
bottom of the first. 
</P>
<P>
Having entered the game with a 3-3 record, the Dodgers seemed headed toward the 
sub-.500 mark for the first time since the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"But look at the top part of our lineup, it is very different from last 
season," Belcher said. "That home run did not devastate me, because I know that 
our good offense had eight more cracks at them. It didn't feel any worse than 
if we were trailing, say, 2-0, in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, led by Samuel and Randolph, the Dodgers pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
They scored one in the third against Jim Deshaies on Randolph's run-scoring 
single after walks to Alfredo Griffin and Samuel. They scored two to tie it in 
the fifth on Randolph's run-scoring single and Hubie Brooks' run-scoring double 
in a rally that again included a walk to Samuel, his fourth in three games. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm way ahead of my usual pace, huh?" asked Samuel, who just two years 
ago drew 39 walks in 157 games. 
</P>
<P>
After Belcher allowed the last of his four earned runs in the fifth on a 
run-scoring single by Craig Biggio, the Dodgers tied it again in the eighth on 
Randolph's home run on a fastball from reliever Danny Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
Relievers Don Aase and Jay Howell, making his first appearance of the season, 
held the Astros from there. Eddie Murray also helped with his second 
spectacular defensive play of the series, a lunging scoop of a grounder to 
start a ninth-inning ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
All of which set up Samuel's 10th inning heroics. His inspiration during that 
inning, he said, involves his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that if my uniform is not dirty, I have not done my job," Samuel said. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit a Kerfeld pitch toward left-center field for an apparent single, he 
rounded first and never stopped running. By the time Gerald Young, who was 
shaded toward right, caught up with the ball and threw it in, Samuel was diving 
head-first into second. 
</P>
<P>
"What I saw was a guy get a base hit, and then all of a sudden he is standing 
on second base," said Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, who said Samuel reminded 
him of yet another sports star. "I saw that and thought of Steve Sax. That's 
who it was. Steve Sax, and 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph's bunt down the first-base line wasn't great, but Samuel's speed again 
allowed him to move to third without even an Astros' look. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guys who would have drawn a throw to third, but not Juan," 
said Joe Amalfitano, third-base coach. "That's the great excitement of this 
game, guys like him on the basepaths. It was like I told Ron Perranoski (Dodger 
pitching coach), if this guy gets on base in the seventh inning or later of a 
tie game, we're going to score. Games we lost last year by one run, this year 
we're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel needed only to jog 90 feet to score the winning run. Armed with advice 
from Amalfitano that Kerfeld has a habit of throwing wild pitches, he was ready 
when Kerfeld bounced a 1-and-2 slider to Brooks about 10 feet in front of home 
plate, sending the ball spinning past catcher Biggio and to the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told to be ready in case the ball bounced, so when it bounced, I was 
already on my way," Samuel said. 
</P>
<P>
Although batting just .222 after the first week of the season, Samuel appears 
on his way to fulfilling Dodger expectations. In helping the Dodgers take two 
out of three games this weekend, besides drawing four walks, he stole three 
bases and scored two runs. Not to mention his diving catch in center field 
Sunday. True, he struck out five times, but the Dodgers expect that. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was happier about this on Sunday than Lasorda, who has taken on Samuel 
as one of his pet projects, constantly talking with him about shortening his 
swing and drawing more walks and playing a smarter center field. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as early Friday afternoon, long before most of the Dodgers would 
arrive at the Astrodome, Lasorda and the Dodger coaches were working with 
Samuel on the nearly empty field. 
</P>
<P>
"My assessment of him is that, my (earlier) assessment of him was right," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
In his first appearance this season after battling shoulder stiffness, Jay 
Howell was his old self Sunday, allowing just two walks in two innings for the 
win. He ended the game by striking out Gerald Young, looking, on an August-type 
curveball. Howell said the important thing is how he feels the day after he 
pitches, but he senses the shoulder problems could be behind him. "It's going 
to be OK," Howell said. "My first inning (two walks) it felt like a pile of 
rocks, but the second inning was much better. And compared to how it felt after 
I pitched in West Palm Beach (end of spring training), it's much better." 
Howell's predecessor, Don Aase, allowed just one hit in two innings and later 
said that moving into the role of a setup man -- something the Dodgers have 
lacked thus far -- would be fine with him. "I'm used to closing games, and 
setting them up for the closer is just about the same thing," Aase said. "You 
pitch a couple of innings and do your best and sometimes you get the job done, 
and sometimes you don't." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Rick Dempsey was suffering from back spasms following Sunday's game. If 
the pain persists and Dempsey is forced to go on the disabled list, look for 
Darrin Fletcher to be recalled from triple-A Albuquerque. . . . Struggling Jeff 
Hamilton, who has tendinitis in his right shoulder, was benched Sunday for Mike 
Sharperson, who was later replaced by Lenny Harris when Houston's left-handed 
starter Jim Deshaies was replaced by right-handed reliever Xavier Hernandez. 
Hamilton later appeared as a pinch-hitter, but popped out to first base in the 
eighth inning with runners on first and second and the score tied, 4-4. That 
dropped his average to .125, and could mean that the Sharperson-Harris platoon 
will continue. The two reserves combined to go zero for three Sunday. 
Sharperson couldn't backhand Craig Biggio's ground ball that skipped under his 
glove and went into left field for a double. . . . When Tim Belcher picked off 
Biggio at first base in the fifth inning, it was the second pickoff in two 
starts for the team of Belcher and first baseman Eddie Murray. In Belcher's 
first start this season, they picked off Roberto Alomar.

OVERTIME WAS RIGHT FOR KINGS; 
</P>
<P>
FLAMES: CALGARY'S PLAYERS STAY COOL, BUT THEIR COACH IS TESTY AFTER GOAL IS 
DISALLOWED IN FIRST EXTRA PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Terry Crisp, coach of the Calgary Flames, is sometimes described by Calgary 
reporters as His Crispness. 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday night, His Crispness was extra crispy. 
</P>
<P>
An apparent game-winning goal by Doug Gilmour of the Flames with 2:23 left in 
the first overtime had been disallowed by referee Denis Morel, who said that he 
had whistled the play dead. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings went on to beat the Flames, 4-3, at the Forum on a fluke goal by Mike 
Krushelnyski at 3:14 of the second overtime, wrapping up the best-of-seven 
Smythe Division semifinal playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
As the Edmonton Oilers had been last April, the defending Stanley Cup champions 
were dethroned in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
His Crispness believed that the Flames had been burned. 
</P>
<P>
When Morel's ruling was first announced, Crisp climbed onto the boards in front 
of the Flames' bench and screamed across the ice at the referee, then gestured 
emphatically toward a television camera, apparently suggesting that Morel 
consult a replay. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the game, Crisp was more subdued, calmly answering questions 
from the media. But as a second wave of reporters began asking again about 
Morel's call, Crisp grew more animated, throwing a cup of ice to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We scored a goal and he just takes it away," Crisp shouted. "He just says, 'No 
goal.' The replay shows it definitely was in, the goal judge puts the light on 
and with total disregard for everything our game stands for, he calls it off. 
He became judge, jury, executioner. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be going home for a seventh game and we're not." 
</P>
<P>
Morel blew the play dead before the puck slid across the goal line, apparently 
losing sight of it after Gilmour's shot from behind the net trickled off the 
pads of King goaltender Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
What did Crisp tell his players? 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Thank you very, very much,' " Crisp said. "They won the hockey game 
and had it taken away from them." 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the Flames didn't feel cheated. 
</P>
<P>
"We cheated ourselves," defenseman Brad McCrimmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the Smythe Division for a third consecutive season, the Flames 
self-destructed against the fourth-place Kings. They took a rash of ill-advised 
penalties, allowing the Kings almost eight power-play opportunities per game, 
and their own power play lost its vigor. 
</P>
<P>
After converting 27.7% of their power-play opportunities during the regular 
season -- best in the NHL -- the Flames scored only twice in 33 manpower 
advantages against the Kings, only once in 31 chances after Al MacInnis scored 
on a penalty shot in the first period of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
They lost Game 1 after leading, 3-1, in the third period, they lost Game 3 in 
overtime on a shorthanded goal by Tony Granato and they gave up a club-record 
12 goals in an eight-goal loss in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
Even in winning Game 2, the Flames were far from dominant. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play to our ability early in the series, when we should have," 
winger Gary Roberts said. "We were down, 3-1, before we blinked our eyes. And 
when you're down 3-1, a few bad bounces against you and it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames led, 3-2, with less than two minutes left in regulation before a 
shot from the right point by the Kings' Steve Duchesne appeared to glance off a 
Flame player, changing direction slightly and sailing past goaltender Mike 
Vernon for the goal that sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, we left ourselves open to that kind of a risk by putting 
ourselves in the hole that we dug for ourselves," McCrimmon said. "We put 
ourselves there. It's our own fault." 
</P>
<P>
But if Morel's call had favored the Flames, and Gilmour's apparent goal had 
been allowed, they would be back in the Saddledome again. 
</P>
<P>
And they would have been heavy favorites to win Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
"If wasn't on our side tonight," Ric Nattress said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was Morel, but too many other things had gone wrong for the Flames to 
blame their plight on one call, the veteran defenseman said. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in the first four games?" Nattress said. "We played our best 
hockey the last two games, but the first four games we didn't play to our 
capabilities, and it showed. It showed in the 12-4 score (in Game 4) and it 
showed in letting them score five goals after we were (way ahead) in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say that our effort wasn't there, but we weren't concentrating 
in the right direction in the first four games. Unfortunately, we kicked it in 
when maybe it was a little too late." 
</P>
<P>
While most of the Flames seemed to believe they got what they deserved, Crisp 
seemed to believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that it has to end like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When had the series turned, somebody asked the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when they disallowed the goal," Crisp said.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T WANT SCOUTING TRIP TO END UP A FLASH IN THE PAN

When Cincinnati Manager Lou Piniella took the Reds into Houston last week, it 
was only the second time he had been in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
He told Peter Schmuck of the Baltimore Sun that the first time was two years 
ago when New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner sent him there on a secret 
mission to scout Kevin Bass for a possible deal. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella: "George wanted me to sit in left field with an old hat, a pair of 
glasses and a raincoat. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'George, they'll throw me out of the stadium.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'What do you mean?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'It's a domed stadium!' " 
</P>
<P>
Add baseball notebook: Schmuck excerpted the following from a profile of 
pitcher Bryn Smith in the St. Louis Cardinal media guide: "Bryn's parents met 
while working at the old RKO Studios in Hollywood. They were introduced by 
actress Jane Russell after his mother, Meg, had been dating Cary Grant. Bryn is 
a big fan of the rock group Rush and credits lead singer Geddy Lee with helping 
him to handle crowds, a lesson he picked up after joining the group on tour for 
a week following the 1984 season." 
</P>
<P>
Schmuck: "Is this for real?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Pie Traynor, Pee Wee Reese and Pete Reiser have in common? 
</P>
<P>
He delivers: How good a clutch hitter is Will Clark? Here are some 1989 
statistics on the San Francisco slugger from the Elias Baseball Analyst: He hit 
.526 with men in scoring position and the Giants down by a run. He hit .426 
with men in scoring position and the score tied. He hit .431 against the NL's 
10 pitchers with the lowest earned-run averages. His .472 postseason average 
was the third highest since 1969. (Brooks Robinson hit .485 in 1970 and Thurman 
Munson .475 in 1976.) 
</P>
<P>
Triple whammy: Anyone notice that a tradition was preserved when Raymond Floyd 
lost the Masters? On the Wednesday before the Masters, Floyd won the annual 
par-three tournament. No winner of that tournament has ever won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Pick-me-up: Denver Nugget Coach Doug Moe has taken some flak for his disheveled 
look, but San Antonio Coach Larry Brown, a longtime friend, thinks it's great. 
</P>
<P>
"When things aren't looking good," Brown says, "you can always look at Doug and 
make yourself feel good." 
</P>
<P>
55 years ago today: On April 16, 1935, 40-year-old Babe Ruth made his National 
League debut for the Boston Braves. He homered and singled off Carl Hubbell to 
lead the Braves to a 4-2 victory over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The same first name, Harold. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller, asked if the shortened spring 
training has hurt the pitchers: "If you can't get in shape in three weeks, you 
should be a plumber." HARLEY TINKHAM

TO ERR IS HUMAN -- AND VERY TWINS-LIKE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: MINNESOTA GETS BETTER PITCHING THAN ANTICIPATED, BUT DEFENSE HAS 
FALLEN ON UNACCUSTOMED HARD TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The list of fine alumni of the Minnesota Twins' pitching staff keeps growing, 
with Frank Viola and Jeff Reardon gone from last year's team, and the Angels' 
Bert Blyleven from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
But the Twins seemed prepared to face a transition to a young staff, if only 
because their pitchers would have a strong defense behind them. Gary Gaetti has 
won the past four Gold Gloves at third base, and Kirby Puckett has done the 
same in center field. 
</P>
<P>
But the early season has produced a different scene. The Twins, who finished 
third in the American League in fielding last year and led the major leagues in 
fielding in their World Series championship season of 1987 and 1988, have 
committed 11 errors in the first week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The lockout-shortened spring can be blamed, but no other team in the league has 
had the Twins' troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Gaetti, after committing 10 all last season, already has three errors at third. 
Puckett, who had four all last season, also has three, the latest when he lost 
a fly ball in the sun, allowing a run to score in the third inning of a 4-1 
loss to the Angels at Anaheim Stadium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Kelly is left to wonder how long it will take for the effects of 
the shortened spring -- or whatever ails his defense -- to wear away. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it will be up to the players," he said. "Errors are part of the game, 
but there been a few extra to start the season." 
</P>
<P>
While the Twins have struggled defensively, they have gotten surprisingly 
strong pitching from a staff that ranges in age from 25 to 28. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, Allan Anderson is the ace, having won 33 games over the past two 
seasons. He and Roy Smith, 28, who was 10-6 for the Twins last year, are the 
most experienced starters. 
</P>
<P>
The other two starters were among the five pitchers acquired in the trade that 
sent Viola and outfielder Loy McBride to the Mets last July. 
</P>
<P>
One is David West, 25, who has a 4-5 record after losing his first start this 
season in a game in which he allowed two runs in six innings. Neither run was 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Kevin Tapani, who pitched six shutout innings to win his first 
start. In his second, he struck out eight Angels in five innings Sunday, but 
lost after giving up four runs -- two unearned -- in a game in which the Twins 
committed two errors, one by Tapani. 
</P>
<P>
He had only himself to blame for the Angels' first run, which he set up with 
two out in the second inning by walking Dante Bichette and hitting John Orton 
with a pitch. Rick Schu's single down the third-base line, the Angels' first 
hit of the game, scored Bichette. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting a guy with two out like that wasn't good," Tapani said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-run, two-error third inning did in his chances for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tapani gave up a double to Max Venable to open the inning. Mark McLemore laid 
down a sacrifice bunt, but Tapani slipped and fell as he attempted to field the 
ball, with Venable reaching third and McLemore safe at first. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, the grass gave way," Tapani said. "It was just a little bit wet. 
I took out a big divot." 
</P>
<P>
McLemore moved over on Wally Joyner's infield out, and Tapani gave up a two-run 
single to Chili Davis. An out later, Bichette lofted a fly ball to deep center 
field, but Puckett lost it in the sun, and Davis scored, with Bichette going 
all the way to third. 
</P>
<P>
The errors are not all of a kind, and they are not the sort of thing for which 
there is a tonic or cure. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was a good example," Kelly said. "The guy just slipped on the turf. 
Puckett lost a ball in the sun. What can you tell them? (Angel) Wally Joyner 
throws a ball into the stands (Friday) . . . What are you going to do, have 
them practice throwing to third?" 
</P>
<P>
Tapani just hopes that he will be able to continue pitching well, and trusts 
that the defensive slips such as his own will go away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny game, I guess," Tapani said. "I hope down the road it's not the 
other way around, where we're making the plays but the pitching has fallen 
apart."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
WELCH PROVES TO ATHLETICS THAT HE'S READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Welch's pitching in spring training was so disappointing, the Oakland 
Athletics didn't think he would be ready when the season began. 
</P>
<P>
And the first pitch the veteran right-hander threw in his first start was hit 
for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
However, that was not an indication of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Welch held the Mariners to three hits in 6 1/3 innings Sunday at Seattle, and 
Mark McGwire hit a two-run homer in the Athletics' 3-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Welch is 2-0. Since Minnesota's Dan Gladden hit a home run Tuesday night at 
Oakland, Welch has not yielded a run. He has given up only eight more hits in 
11 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
In each victory, McGwire hit a two-run home run for the winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
"His spring training numbers (0-3 and an earned-run average of 17.36) were 
ugly," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "It was important for him to get off to 
a good start. He had control of his stuff and control of himself. He didn't 
give them much to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Welch helped himself with a barehand stab of Jeff Leonard's sharp bouncer, 
which he turned into a double play to end the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland has everything. Even their pitchers are great fielders," Seattle 
Manager Jim Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics are getting very effective pitching. They are 5-1 and the staff 
ERA is 2.00. The sweep of the three-game series was their first in the Kingdome 
since April, 1986. The Mariners have lost five in a row since beating the 
Angels in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Cleveland 1 -- The White Sox brought up third baseman Robin Ventura 
from double-A Birmingham at the end of last season so he could get major league 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Now the rookie from Santa Maria who played college ball at Oklahoma State, is 
expected to become a star. He took a big step in that direction Sunday at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura had three hits, including a double and triple, and made a sensational 
diving catch to lead the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
He also scored a run and drove in one, but White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg was 
raving about the play that took a double away from Brook Jacoby in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that Ozzie (Guillen) is a great shortstop," Torborg said, "and Ventura 
gives us a cornerstone to build on. I also like the way he swings the bat." 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Texas 1 -- For one day at least, the Yankees discovered that four 
of their relievers were more effective than the Rangers' bullpen stopper. 
</P>
<P>
The four Yankee relievers pitched six shutout innings, while Jeff Russell, who 
led American League relievers last season by converting 44 opportunities into 
38 saves, couldn't hold the lead for Charlie Hough. 
</P>
<P>
Hough gave up just two singles in seven innings at New York, but when he walked 
the lead-off man in the eighth, Russell was summoned. 
</P>
<P>
Russell made a wild pitch, then made a wild throw after fielding a bunt and 
gave up run-scoring singles to Rick Cerone and Steve Sax. 
</P>
<P>
"In this job you're either a star or a goat," Russell said. "I was a goat 
today, but I'll be a star tomorrow. But it's unfortunate these things happen. 
It hurt to see Charlie pitch so well and have the game get away. It eats you." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's collapse made a winner of Eric Plunk, his second victory in relief. 
Dave Righetti pitched the ninth for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Kansas City 4 -- Even though he went four for four, including a 
bases-loaded double, Junior Felix still doesn't like Royals Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't see the ball here," he said. "Today, I tried something different 
and it must have helped. I straightened up in my stance. I saw the ball better. 
I still don't like this park." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, behind Tom Gordon, were leading, 2-0, after five innings. But the 
Blue Jays loaded the bases in the sixth inning, and Felix hit the ball over 
center fielder Willie Wilson's head for a three-run double. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he played me a little too shallow," Felix said. "I don't know if he 
would have caught it anyhow. I hit it hard." 
</P>
<P>
Although Dave Stieb gave up nine hits in six innings, the five-run inning 
enabled him to improve his record to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays won the series, 2-1. Last season the Royals had the best home 
record in the majors, 55-26. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Baltimore 4 -- When Mark Salas hit a two-run home run in the eighth 
inning, it made Dan Petry a winner in his return to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Petry, a starter for the world champion Tigers in 1984, pitched two innings of 
scoreless relief to win his first game for Detroit since Sept. 15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Petry was traded to the Angels after the 1987 season and released after last 
season. The Tigers signed him to a minor-league contract, so he had the benefit 
of the full six weeks of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I pitched very well today," Petry said. "But I kept them from 
scoring. It's a big thrill to come back here and make a contribution. I hope I 
can do it often." DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
WINNING NO PROBLEM FOR RELAXED REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After the tumultuous 1989 season, it's not surprising that the Cincinnati Reds 
are loose and relaxed under new Manager Lou Piniella. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the controversy surrounding Pete Rose because of his gambling bothered 
the Reds. In addition, injuries sidelined some key players. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are off to their best start in a decade. They have combined hitting 
and pitching to win their first five games. Only a heavy rain Saturday night in 
Atlanta, when they had a 9-4 lead over the Braves, kept them from being 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
They came back after that game was rained out to beat the Braves, 13-6, Sunday 
at Atlanta, with Eric Davis and Chris Sabo each hitting three-run home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Oddibe McDowell's three-run home run in the sixth inning gave the Braves a 4-2 
lead. But the Reds chased Tom Glavine (0-2) with three singles in the seventh 
and Eric Davis followed with his first homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds broke the game open with seven runs in the ninth, three on Sabo's 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sabo hit only six home runs and drove in 29 runs. In five games 
this season he has three homers and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo credits a change in his swing suggested by Piniella for his new success. 
Piniella noticed that Sabo, who hit 17 home runs in each of his first two 
seasons, was off balance and not getting his body into the swing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like hitting a golf ball," Sabo said. "That's the best way to describe 
it. I really feel good now. I have fully recovered from the knee operation last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"But, don't expect too much. Every once in awhile I lapse back into the bad 
habits. I did it Friday in two at-bats. Today, I was better." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella had an easy explanation for the Reds' best start since 1980, when they 
went 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing nice and loose, relaxed and confident," he said. "It's a good 
lineup. We're hitting the ball and the pitching's good." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, San Francisco 3 -- The Reds aren't the only team in the West with 
a five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
After Rick Reuschel stifled the Padres for eight innings at San Francisco, 
Benito Santiago hit a two-run home run in the ninth inning to extend the 
winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was off Steve Bedrosian, the Giants' bullpen ace. Bedrosian 
rejoined the Giants before the game after learning that his son, 2 1/2, has 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, who will be 41 next month, was hit hard in the short spring training. 
But he won his first start, going 5 2/3 scoreless innings at Atlanta. He came 
right back to hold the Padres to two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants took a 3-2 lead in the sixth when Will Clark hit a two-run home run, 
his first homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Chicago 3 -- Sid Bream, who missed most of last season because of 
a knee problem that required surgery, didn't enter the game at Pittsburgh until 
the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th inning, he hit a run-scoring single off Les Lancaster to win the 
game. It was the first run yielded by the Cubs' bullpen in 20 1/3 innings this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla's three-run homer in the third inning accounted for the other 
Pirate runs. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Van Slyke opened the 10th with a single off Lancaster, who had pitched six 
scoreless innings this season. With one out, R.J. Reynolds walked. Bream, the 
goat in Saturday's loss when his error helped the Cubs to three runs, slapped a 
single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, St. Louis 0 -- The Phillies planned to use Dennis Cook out of 
the bullpen this season. So much for plans. 
</P>
<P>
In a starting assignment brought about because of the short spring training, 
Cook was brilliant at Philadelphia. He gave up only seven hits and one walk in 
8 2/3 innings. Roger McDowell got the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an outstanding performance," Phillie Manager Nick Leyva said. "That 
shows how smart I am. I've had him in the bullpen. If he keeps pitching like 
that he'll be tough to get out of the rotation." 
</P>
<P>
Len Dykstra, who missed the first five games because of an injured right side, 
was the offensive star. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, who said his swing was a little restricted, led off innings with hits 
four times and scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mystery to me," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. "We have guys in 
our lineup who should hit left-handers and they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, New York 1 -- Manager Davey Johnson was hoping the Mets would get 
off to a fast start and help get him off the hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Mets have fallen into last place in the East and already there are 
rumors his job is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Zane Smith, helped by three double plays, gave up only one run in eight innings 
at Montreal to hand the Mets their fourth defeat in six games. Smith gave up

CELTICS, MAKING A MOVE, GET PAST KNICKS, 101-94

Larry Bird may be, as Magic Johnson claims, all the way back, but there is a 
new look to the Boston Celtics in their bid to return to elite status in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Until he missed last season because of surgery on both Achilles' tendon, for a 
decade, Bird was the player the Celtics went to in the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
When the Celtics rallied to beat the New York Knicks, 101-94, Sunday at Boston 
for their sixth consecutive victory, it was Reggie Lewis they turned to in the 
clutch. 
</P>
<P>
Bird's shooting was horrendous, so it was up to the sharpshooting third-year 
guard if the Celtics were to keep their slim hopes of winning the Atlantic 
Division alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, after building a 13-point lead early in the third quarter, allowed 
the Knicks to fight back and take a six-point lead. The Knicks were still in 
front, 88-87, with 4 1/2 minutes to play. That's when, with Bird five for 22 
from the field, the Celtics turned to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 3 1/2 minutes, Lewis scored eight of the points in a 10-5 run that 
handed the Knicks their 24th consecutive defeat in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Except for his shooting, Bird was outstanding. He had 17 rebounds and 13 
assists. He blocked a shot by Patrick Ewing, stole a pass and grabbed a key 
rebound in the last 90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"We forced them to go to the man we wanted to shoot," Knicks' Coach Stu Jackson 
said. "He just didn't miss in the clutch." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis made 12 of 18 shots and finished with 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who are 1 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia 76ers, can win the 
division by winning their last four games. They play home-and-home with 
Chicago, Orlando and at Philadelphia. The 76ers play Indiana and at Detroit 
before closing out with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he watched his friend Bird on satellite TV and learned that Bird 
is back to his best form. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 103, Minnesota 90 -- Karl Malone kept his cool at Minneapolis and the Jazz 
increased their lead in the Midwest Division to two games over San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, thrown out in the first half of Saturday night's loss to Houston at 
Salt Lake, had 32 points to pass the 10,000-point mark in his four-year career. 
He also had 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 40,415 enabled the expansion Timberwolves to draw a million fans. 
They need 43,485 at the Metrodome in their finale to break the record of 
1,066,505 set by Detroit in 1987-88. DAN HAFNER

TED BANKS HAS FOUND HIMSELF ANOTHER STAR

<P>
Britain's Peter Elliott won the mile last February in the Times/Eagle Indoor 
Games at the Forum, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
What was unexpected, though, was the 20-year-old runner who was persistently 
pushing Elliott the last six laps. 
</P>
<P>
Noureddine Morceli, a native of Algeria who runs for Riverside Community 
College, didn't beat Elliott, an international star, but he did beat such 
renowned milers as Ireland's Marcus O'Sullivan, Steve Scott and Joe Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
Morceli's time was a creditable 3 minutes 55.83 seconds, a national junior 
college record. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great young talent. He can run with anybody," said Ted Banks, 
Riverside's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Banks has an eye for talent, especially foreigners. While coaching Texas El 
Paso in the 1970s and early 1980s, his corps of African runners, such as 
Suleiman Nyambui and James Munyala, led UTEP to a total of 16 NCAA titles -- 
indoor, outdoor and cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
He also coached Julius Kariuki at Riverside a few years ago. The Kenyan won the 
3,000-meter steeplechase at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Morceli, who comes from Tenes, a small city near the Mediterranean Sea, was 
referred to Banks by Lofti Khadilia, an Algerian triple jumper who competed for 
Riverside in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"He has become real Americanized," Banks said of Morceli. "His English is 
improving and he has a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Morceli wore green shorts, his country's colors, to track meets last year 
instead of the regulation black. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just kidding," said Morceli, who was teasing Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Morceli said his goal is to eventually break, or threaten world records in the 
mile and 1,500 meters. That would put him in a class with Said Aouita, the 
famous middle distance runner from Morocco, a neighboring country of Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came here, he had only run from the mile on down," Banks said. "We've 
moved him up to the 5,000 for strength work. He has real good speed. He can run 
a 1:48 800 and, with training, we can get him down to 1:46, or 1:45. He's 
capable of a 3:50 mile, but not yet." 
</P>
<P>
Morceli set a national junior college 5,000 record of 13:44.71 last month in a 
meet at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
He'll try to better that time Saturday night in the distance carnival portion 
of the Mt. San Antonio College Relays. 
</P>
<P>
"In last year's race there he didn't know as much about pace as he does now and 
he got knocked around quite a bit and dropped out," Banks said. "Now we're 
going to put him in with the big boys (Kenyans, Mexicans) again and he should 
lower that 5,000 JC record by 15, or more seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Banks said that Morceli is addicted to some fast foods, but is careful about 
his diet with a fondness for noodles. 
</P>
<P>
"What really worried me was that he fasted from sunup to to sundown during part 
of the season and wasn't allowed to drink water," Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Morceli says he's in good shape for Saturday night's 5,000. He 
also plans to run the mile in the Jack in the Box Invitational meet May 20 at 
Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He'll compete on the European circuit in the summer months and will then remain 
in Riverside training under Banks when his eligibility expires. 
</P>
<P>
As of now, he's enjoying is American experience and his teammates have a 
nickname for him: "Wonder Boy." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Douglas, Carl Lewis' manager, says that the famed sprinter-long jumper, 
won't compete until July 21 in the Goodwill Games in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is busy now promoting his book, "Inside Track, My Life as a Professional 
in Amateur Sports." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis intends to pass up the national meet scheduled June 14-16 at Cerritos 
College as he did last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has several grievances against The Athletics Congress, saying among other 
things that there's not enough financial support for athletes in every event. 
</P>
<P>
However, there may be a snag in Lewis' plans to compete in the Goodwill Games. 
The International Competition Committee passed a ruling excluding athletes who 
bypass the TAC meet from the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions, though, for injuries and illness. 
</P>
<P>
The license plate on shot putter Randy Barnes' car succinctly states his 
long-term goal: 80 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, the silver medalist in the 1988 Olympics, will compete in the Eveland 
Ashford Invitational Sunday of the Mt. SAC Relays. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Ulf Timmermann, the Olympic gold medalist, is the world 
record-holder at 75 feet 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
The injury list among UCLA and USC track and field athletes continues to grow 
and could put a damper on the cross-town meet April 28 at the Coliseum. Among 
the Bruins who were unable to compete Saturday in a meet against Houston were 
quarter-miler Steve Lewis, shot putter Brian Blutreich, hurdler Derek Knight, 
long jumper Derrick Baker and long-triple jumper McArthur Anderson, who 
recently underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. . . . USC sprinter 
Quincy Watts suffered a cramp in his left hamstring in a nonscoring meet 
against LSU Saturday. Long jumper Dietmar Haaf and intermediate hurdler George 
Porter were already inactive. Haaf has a groin injury, while Porter had a wart 
removed from the sole of his left foot. . . . UCLA's Chuckie Brooks returned to 
long jumping after a two year's absence because of a foot injury and a had a 
creditable jump of 24-10 1/2 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Antonio College has a formidable sprint corps in Nigeria's Davidson and 
Osmond Ezinwa, twin brothers, and Victor Nwankwo. Davidson finished second last 
January in the 100 meters at the Commonwealth Games in New Zealand with the 
fast time of 10.05 seconds. Davidson, Osmond and Victor ran 1-2-3 in the 100 in 
a March 29 meet against Long Beach City College, shutting out LBCC's Bryan 
Bridgewater, the national junior sprint champion. It was the first dual meet 
loss for LBCC dating back to Feb. 22, 1978, or 68 consecutive meets. . . . 
Brazil's Jose Luis Barbosa, who is fifth ranked in the world in the 800 meters, 
is now competing for San Diego City College. He's 28 years old. . . . Riverside 
CC Coach Ted Banks was banned for 12 years by The Athletics Congress along with 
some athletes in 1988 for participating in a meet in South Africa. Meets aren't 
sanctioned there because of the country's policy of racial separation. What 
does the ban mean to Banks? "Nothing," he said. TAC doesn't have any 
jurisdiction over college athletics.

CAPITALS KEEP WINNING WITH BEAUPRE IN GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don Beaupre began the first round of the playoffs as the backup goaltender for 
the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The man ahead of him, Mike Liut, figured to play every game in the 
best-of-seven series against the New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Devils took a two-games-to-one series lead, Capitals' Coach Terry 
Murray decided to give Liut a night off. 
</P>
<P>
Beaupre took charge and the Capitals charged to three consecutive victories to 
earn the right to play the New York Rangers in the second round of the Stanley 
Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In his third consecutive solid game, Beaupre stopped 32 shots at Landover, Md., 
Sunday night, and the Capitals outfought New Jersey, 3-2, to win the series, 
4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Beaupre gave up just six goals in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he discouraged the Devils early, stopping two breakaways and making 
several saves in the first period. Then, on a power-play attempt in the second 
period, he made back-to-back saves from point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals beat goalie Chris Terreri in the last minute of each of the first 
two periods. Steve Leach put Washington ahead, 1-0, with 11 seconds left in the 
first period. Then, with 54 seconds remaining in the second, John Druce made it 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The best-of-seven division final between the Capitals and the Rangers, who beat 
the New York Islanders in five games, will begin Thursday night at New York. 
The Rangers, who won the Patrick Division, will have home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Boston 2 -- Kevin Dineen scored at 12:30 of overtime at Hartford 
and the Whalers, after blowing a 2-0 lead, fought back to tie the series at 
three games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive game of the best-of-seven series will be played Tuesday night at 
Boston. The Bruins are hoping to have their two best players, playmaker Craig 
Janney and defenseman Ray Bourque, back. 
</P>
<P>
Both missed game six. Janney reinjured a bruised left shoulder in game five, 
and Bourque suffered a hip injury in the second game and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers' Scott Young opened the scoring in the first period and made it 2-0 
in the second when Ron Francis' centering pass hit the Bruins' Dave Poulin's 
skate and went in the net. 
</P>
<P>
Poulin cut the lead to a goal halfway through the period, and in the first 
minute of the last period Randy Burridge tied it. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Buffalo 2 -- The Canadiens were the third-place team in the Adams 
Division, but by beating the Sabres, 4-2, in the opening round, have advanced 
to the division final. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Lemieux and Russ Courtnall scored before the middle of the final period 
to put the Canadiens in command. 
</P>
<P>
Courtnall completed the scoring into an empty net in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Roy was a standout in the nets throughout the series for the Canadiens. 
Sunday, he stopped 22 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal will play the winner of the Boston-Hartford series. DAN HAFNER

Scientology's Guide to the IRS 
</P>
<P>
Got a problem with the Internal Revenue Service? The Church of Scientology 
wants to help. 
</P>
<P>
With a near 20-year history of disputes with federal tax authorities to guide 
it, the Los Angeles-based church has put out its latest guide, called "How to 
Protect Your Rights as a Taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
The 20-page booklet takes individuals through the basics, from getting help in 
preparing a return to taking the IRS to court. It is also filled with tips, 
such as suggestions that taxpayers tape record IRS interviews, request IRS 
files through the Freedom of Information Act and get any IRS tax advice in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the handbook is not exactly impartial, and that's pretty clear from the 
outset. The introduction's initial sentence reads: "The individual American 
taxpayer has for many years been under assault by an insensitive, over-zealous 
and out-of-control Internal Revenue Service." 
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology believes that with all its soul, too, particularly 
since the government revoked one of its churches' tax-exempt status in 1964 and 
imposed a $1.3-million tax bill on it after audits of its 1970-72 returns. 
</P>
<P>
Lafayette, We Are Here Again 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to quench its thirst for attention, Mendocino Beverage Co. 
embarked on a self-proclaimed "mock mercy mission" in February, shipping 
gallons of its California mineral water to parched Paris. The firm's message? 
If there's no Perrier, let them drink Mendocino. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier, the former king of the bottled-water shelf, was yanked from markets 
worldwide Feb. 14 when bottles of the French refresher were found to be 
contaminated with benzene. 
</P>
<P>
"Expressing fears that the French populace may face widespread water shortages, 
Georg Moller-Racke, president of Mendocino Beverage Co., launched a mercy 
mission dubbed Thirst Aid to France," gushed a release from the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mendocino officials, who call their product California's only naturally 
carbonated bottled mineral water, are negotiating to export the bubbly beverage 
to France. The results, so far, have not been good, but their enthusiasm is not 
dampened. After all, they've just begun to get their feet wet. 
</P>
<P>
Red, Green, Made All Over 
</P>
<P>
The H. J. Heinz Co. was thumping a "green" tub last week. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the food processing giant unveiled a new plan to allow full 
recycling of its squeezable plastic ketchup bottles. In a fat packet 
mass-mailed to news outlets, Heinz enclosed a sample of one of the "57 
varieties" of uses for the recycled material: an 8-by-6-inch swatch of carpet 
with a label proclaiming, "This pristine white carpet used to be a Heinz 
Ketchup bottle." 
</P>
<P>
Then on Thursday came Heinz's dramatic pledge not to market any tuna caught in 
ways that are harmful to dolphins. The "dolphin-safe" announcement produced 
another flurry of paper: fact sheets, backgrounders, graphics, profiles of 
company executives -- nearly all of it bearing the environmentally correct 
notation, "Printed on Recycled Paper."

Brazilians Support Anti-Inflation Plan: Seven out of 10 Brazilians support the 
tough anti-inflation plan of President Fernando Collor de Mello, which has 
frozen most of the money in the country for 18 months, according to a poll. 
</P>
<P>
Published exactly a month after Collor took office, the poll said 71% thought 
the plan was good and 10% thought it was bad. The poll was published by the 
newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. A poll published by the newspaper on March 21 
found that 81% thought the plan was good. Collor set very low limits on how 
much money people could take from their existing bank account balances to try 
to beat inflation of nearly 5,000%.

Playboy Sued Over Betty Boop Cartoon: The creator and copyright owner of Betty 
Boop filed a copyright infringement suit against Playboy Enterprises, which 
used a fully clothed drawing of the cartoon character to illustrate an article 
called "Return of the Designing Woman." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, brought in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, said the use of Betty 
Boop falsely gave the impression that Fleischer Studios Inc. of New York 
authorized or endorsed Playboy magazine. The suit seeks unspecified damages of 
at least $100,000. (Filed April 9, 1990. Case No. 90-1767)

PEPSICO PLANS $1.1-BILLION EXPANSION 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepsico Inc., the giant food and beverage conglomerate, plans to spend $1.1 
billion in 1990 to expand its worldwide business, with the biggest chunk of 
cash going to its booming fast-food restaurant system. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual report to stockholders, Pepsico said the expenditure "reflects 
strategies to expand international snack food capacity, increase soft drink 
vending presence worldwide and expand domestic pizza delivery operations." 
</P>
<P>
The company said 40% of its capital spending this year will be devoted to 
expanding the Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, with the 
rest split evenly between the Pepsi-Cola soft drink business and its Frito-Lay 
and Europe-based Smiths and Walkers snack foods. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsico is the world's biggest restaurant operator but is still best known 
among U.S. consumers for its cola drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman D. Wayne Calloway said his company's focus for the new decade includes 
becoming "an even stronger player on a global scale." 
</P>
<P>
"Although we've nearly tripled our international operating profits in the past 
two years, they still represent only 16% of our total," Calloway said. 
</P>
<P>
On April 9, the Purchase, N.Y.-based company announced a complex barter deal 
with Moscow aimed at doubling its bottling network in the Soviet Union. The 
deal is valued at $3 billion over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola Co. has also announced plans to begin sales in India, whose new 
government recently rejected an application from Cola-Cola to re-enter a market 
it left in the mid-1970s rather than reveal its top-secret cola formula.

BANKS: THE RISING COSTS OF THE S&amp;L BAILOUT ADD IMPETUS TO THE MOVEMENT FOR 
CHANGE.

Treasury officials, spurred by the enormous cost of the savings and loan 
catastrophe, are developing proposals for what could be the most sweeping 
changes in banking regulation since the 1930s, government and industry sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations have sought many of the 
changes since the early 1980s, but the effort now has a new urgency because of 
the breakdown of the S&amp;L bailout program unveiled by the White House a year 
ago. The cost of the bailout has been projected at more than $300 billion over 
30 years, and the estimates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Officials want to air the proposals in coming months, but do not plan to 
propose formal legislation until after fall elections. Among proposals being 
discussed within the administration are a major change in deposit insurance, 
the possible elimination of a separate thrift industry, revamping the 
jurisdictions of regulators and eliminating the barriers between commercial 
banking and the securities business, government and industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's goal is to further deregulate the financial services industry -- 
for example, allowing banks to sell insurance and stocks -- and to ensure that 
supervision is strengthened to prevent abuses, the officials said. The 
officials also are trying to promote and protect the industry as foreign 
competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
Such broad legislation likely would touch off intense lobbying by banks and 
securities firms seeking to protect special market niches, industry and 
administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury, which is leading the effort, asked the Federal Reserve Board, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
submit recommendations for how to accomplish these goals, an administration 
source said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has decided to use a congressionally 
ordered study on federal deposit insurance reform as a vehicle for the 
comprehensive package of financial laws and regulatory revisions, 
administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L bailout legislation passed last August required the Treasury to 
submit such a report to Congress within 18 months. Administration officials 
said they cannot revamp deposit insurance without other fundamental 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson and other Treasury 
officials have discussed the proposals in private with industry officials and 
key Capitol Hill lawmakers. Robson, speaking to the Independent Bankers Assn. 
of America in Washington on April 2, outlined three of the major legislative 
changes that the administration intends to seek, said bankers who attended the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to congressional staff members and industry officials, the 
administration proposes to combine the thrift industry's deposit insurance fund 
with the fund that guarantees commercial bank deposits, and to abolish the new 
Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Many S&amp;Ls would be merged with banks, and the thrift industry's role as a 
government-backed housing finance industry would end, these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials also are considering a number of ways to change the federal 
insurance of consumer deposits, including reducing the maximum deposit insured 
from $100,000 to $50,000, limiting customers to one federally insured account 
per bank and introducing some combination of government and private insurance 
of accounts.

<P>
The breach of contract and trademark suit said FBC Food Services Inc. and 
Midwest Restaurant Concepts Inc. opened Sizzler restaurants as licensees but 
failed to pay charges relating to gross sales and advertising. The suit seeks 
unspecified damages and a court order barring the Illinois-based defendants 
from operating Sizzlers. The defendants could not be reached for comment.

The United States and South Korea ended five days of aviation talks last week 
without agreement on pending issues, the Transportation Ministry announced. 
</P>
<P>
But ministry officials, requesting anonymity, said it was "not a total 
failure." They said differences were somewhat narrowed in some unspecified 
areas and the two sides agreed to meet later. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the American delegation, citing opposition by several U.S. 
airlines, refused again Korea's request that Korean Air Lines be allowed to add 
Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas and Atlanta to its air routes to the United 
States.

JAPAN TRYING TO EASE THE WAY FOR IMPORTS FROM U.S.;

TRADE: DESPITE STEPPED-UP OFFICIAL EFFORTS, SOME EXPORTERS COMPLAIN THAT AN 
'OLD BOYS NETWORK' EFFECTIVELY KEEPS THEM OUT OF ITS MARKETS.

Never mind the plunging yen. Don't worry about rising Japanese interest rates, 
says Minoru Masuda, the new chairman of the Japan External Trade Organization 
(JETRO). 
</P>
<P>
While those factors might make exporting to Japan a bit more difficult, the 
Japanese government is expanding its aid to Americans and others interested in 
selling to the world's second-largest consumer market, Masuda said during a 
recent visit to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Japan's largest trade-promotion group increased its budget 
sevenfold to a total of $100 million. The money will pay for a variety of new 
services, including import-promotion centers and an expanded computer database. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear Americans think that Japanese don't want to import their goods and 
that Japan has certain barriers," said Masuda, who has held various posts in 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, including vice minister of 
international affairs, since 1947. "The truth is, far from it. We were 
instructed to do everything we could to promote imports." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's efforts, however, many Japanese firms are still 
beholden to an "old boys network" that effectively shuts out foreign products, 
said one Southern California businessman who just returned from a 
JETRO-sponsored trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 110% from JETRO, but from the companies, absolutely nothing," said 
Harold Martinez, who represented Able Industrial Products Inc., Tam Produce, 
Cumbre Inc. and Barron Transworld Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Les Riddell of the Western Furnishings Manufacturers Assn. was more optimistic. 
After nine days and several meetings in Japan, he concluded that California 
furniture companies could succeed by providing high-quality goods, establishing 
a name and hooking up with a local Japanese partner. 
</P>
<P>
JETRO's expanded promotional efforts will include: 
</P>
<P>
* Twenty new "import-promotion centers" throughout Japan. The centers will 
display foreign products and provide specialists to help local Japanese find 
American and foreign suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
* An expanded computer database with quicker retrieval capacities that can 
match up foreign exporters and Japanese importers in 49 cities in Japan and 
JETRO's 35 overseas offices. 
</P>
<P>
* A program to send about 25 Japanese trade experts overseas for as long as a 
year. The experts will advise foreigners on how to fit their products to Japan 
and scour local markets for potential imports. 
</P>
<P>
* Business missions to Japan for 200 foreign guests. The foreign business 
people will receive lectures on, say, the Japanese distribution system and 
consumer market. JETRO will also arrange appointments with potential Japanese 
importers as well as pay for travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
The trade organization also plans to expand its buying missions to foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded effort comes amid rising acrimony over trade between the United 
States and Japan. It also comes as several U.S. exporters have begun to feel 
the pinch of the plummeting yen, which has increased the price of American 
goods in Japan by 20% over last year. At the same time, some analysts worry 
that the increase in Japanese interest rates will slow consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the JETRO initiatives, the Japanese government is also offering 
tax incentives to firms to increase imports; low-interest loans for 
import-related businesses, such as foreign shippers, and a reduction in tariffs 
on 1,000 manufactured items. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese side always comes here and looks for something new," said Eiichi 
Nagata, executive director of JETRO's Los Angeles office. The office, headed by 
Chief Executive Director Nobuo Kimura, maintains a staff of 27 to help local 
business people develop trade in Japan. "This time, why doesn't the American 
side visit Japan and we will be waiting to set up appointments for sellers?" 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez said most of the firms he met were unreceptive. 
</P>
<P>
At Fujitsu Ltd. "they made it very clear to me, 'Well, you're here because 
JETRO sent you. Now what else? Why don't you see our plant in San Diego?' " 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Kokubu &amp; Co., a leading food distributor, told him California oranges were 
too contaminated by soil pesticides for the Japanese market. Nissho Iwai Corp., 
a major trading firm, was "a nothing," as was Nissan Motor Corp. Only the 
Japanese Automobile Trade Assn. showed any interest in his plan to develop 
consumer insurance packages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care to go again, to be honest with you. The commitment is not there 
yet," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Riddell said, however, that all four California furniture companies that 
attended a trade show in Japan last year made sales, inspiring his group to 
plan an export strategy there. 
</P>
<P>
"That really fired us up," Riddell said. "We make great furniture . . . and the 
question is, where can we sell it? Japan is the one that has everyone's 
attention."

Moody's Investor Service may soon downgrade the credit ratings of several major 
Japanese banks because of their huge exposure to real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Moody's remains concerned that rapidly rising interest rates or a credit 
crunch could pop the real estate bubble," said a report from the rating agency. 
</P>
<P>
A Moody's Japan official cautioned: "This will not be an across-the-board 
downgrading of Japanese banks." 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Moody's is one of the world's prime rating agencies for judging 
the credit-worthiness of companies and governments. 
</P>
<P>
The official declined to comment on the names or the number of banks involved 
or when Moody's decision would be announced. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the chances that the ratings of at least some banks would be 
downgraded were fairly high. Most major Japanese banks are double-A rated or 
higher. Moody's highest rating is triple A. 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate lending decisions have often been premised on repayment from 
capital gains realized from future land price increases, not from the projected 
cash flows of a project," Moody's said in its recent report on Japanese bank 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's downgraded three Japanese trust banks in February for the same reasons.

DEALS: MARKET WATCH;

<P>
UAL UNIONS NEEDN'T SWEAT IT: LOOPHOLE'S ON THEIR SIDE 
</P>

What's the difference between buying a candy bar for 50 cents and the offer by 
three labor unions to buy United Airlines' parent company for $4.4 billion? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If you buy a candy bar, you have to spend 50 cents of your own money. 
Which is exactly 50 cents more than the unions are offering to put up toward 
the purchase of UAL Corp., the second-largest airline company in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
This deal is being presented as an example of workplace democracy. What this 
deal will really be -- if it goes through, which doesn't seem likely -- is an 
example of how Big Labor can be more clever in getting tax subsidies for 
corporate takeovers than even Big Capital has been. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, if the unions can raise the money to do this deal, it will 
probably happen not because of the deal's economics, but because of a loophole 
in a law that Congress passed last year to make it harder for leveraged buyouts 
to suck cash out of the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Before we get into all of that, a bit of background. The union offer has 
emerged largely to mollify Coniston Partners, UAL's biggest shareholder. 
Coniston, which made a ton of dough putting UAL in play back when UAL was 
called Allegis Corp., went to the well once too often and is stuck with a 12% 
holding in UAL that it is desperate to unload. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping Coniston quiet is the only conceivable reason that UAL's board has 
agreed to pay $20 million in fees even if no deal ever comes about. 
</P>
<P>
That helps explain why this transaction is being treated seriously. To give you 
the short version, the unions want to form an Employee Stock-Ownership Plan 
(known as an ESOP) that would buy UAL entirely with Other People's Money. Most 
of the money, about $3.4 billion, would come from banks. That would pay the 
$155 of cash per share that the unions are offering UAL holders, plus assorted 
fees. The ESOP would give UAL shareholders another $35 a share (around $800 
million) of junk bonds and $11 a share (around $200 million) of stock in a 
computerized reservations system in which UAL has a 50% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Add it all up, and you come to $201 a UAL share, or about $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful. The only thing missing from this pretty picture is any contribution 
to the cause by the unions who will end up owning 100% of UAL in the unlikely 
event that this deal goes through in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
You would think that in today's world -- a world in which the streets are 
littered with dead and dying leveraged buyouts and regulators are leaning on 
banks to limit loans to Highly Leveraged Transactions -- this offer is a total 
non-starter. Look: The first lesson they teach you in Loan Officer School is 
that you don't lend to a borrower who isn't putting any of his own cash in the 
deal. The reason is obvious. If the borrower doesn't have his own money at 
risk, there's nothing to stop him from taking a walk if the loan goes bad. 
</P>
<P>
The unions argue that they're putting up "sweat equity," in the form of wage 
cuts amounting to $2 billion over five years. But that's hard to get your arms 
around -- and impossible to foreclose on. How does a bank turn "sweat equity" 
into money if the UAL loan goes sour? By getting machinists to fix the bank's 
heating system cheap? By getting stewards to hand out packages of nuts at the 
bank's stockholders meeting? 
</P>
<P>
The only reason this deal has any chance of getting past the banks is an 
obscure tax loophole that will be activated only if the ESOP-owned UAL starts 
losing money. That might give the banks some assurance that if the deal 
craters, they stand a fair chance of getting their money back. 
</P>
<P>
The key to understanding this is to remember that the buyer of UAL isn't a 
regular corporation; it's an ESOP. Because of a loophole in loophole-closing 
legislation that Congress passed last year, ESOPs can do something that other 
firms can't: offset losses in an LBO'd outfit by getting refunds of taxes 
previously paid to the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
This used to be one of the great games in the LBO biz, until Congress passed a 
law putting a damper on it last year. The game was that you took a company that 
paid a lot of taxes, you mortgaged it to the eyeballs and you used the losses 
caused by the heavy interest payments to get refunds of taxes paid in earlier 
years. This is what's known in the tax trade as a carryback. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations can usually carry losses back and use them to get refunds of 
previously paid taxes. Individual taxpayers, like you and me, can only carry 
losses forward, using today's losses to shield tomorrow's income. But we can't 
use today's losses to get a refund of yesterday's tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
When RJR Nabisco, reporting huge losses because of its $25-billion LBO, showed 
up at the Treasury trough last year and got a nine-digit refund, Congress 
changed the law to stop the LBO crowd from using this particular game. But the 
law doesn't forbid a company owned by an ESOP from playing the game. Thus, an 
ESOP can use losses incurred by an LBO to get refunds of taxes paid in previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
So if the ESOP buys UAL and New UAL begins to run losses, the ESOP can get 
refunds on some or all of the $575 million of federal income taxes that UAL 
paid in 1987, 1988 and 1989. That's a nice, comforting fact for lenders. 
Congress will undoubtedly close this loophole some day, but for now, the 
airline unions can use this loophole to try to persuade banks to lend money on 
"sweat equity." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't the tax code wonderful?

JACK SMITH: A NOSTALGIC VISIT TO THE WEIRD WONDERS OF VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One recent Saturday my wife and I drove out to Venice. Nostalgia took us there. 
In the late 1940s we had lived for a time in a two-story flat on the Grand 
Canal. In those postwar days the Venice canals were scummy and afloat with 
trash. But there was something romantic about them, with their arched Venetian 
bridges, and the rent was only $45 a month. 
</P>
<P>
We were delighted to find that the canals were still there, a geometrical 
network southeast of Windward Avenue. I doubt that many of the thousands who go 
to Venice beach today are even aware that they exist. They were clean. The 
water was high. Ducks paddled on them. 
</P>
<P>
We found the apartment we had lived in. Many new houses and apartments had been 
built nearby. The area looked expensive. In our day downtown Venice, if there 
is such a place, was occupied by the Beatniks. Does anyone remember them? I 
remember being denied a loan at the local bank. I was hardly more than a 
Beatnik myself. 
</P>
<P>
We drove down to Windward Avenue and Ocean Front Walk, where we found a parking 
space for $5. Ocean Front Walk was like a movie set for which the director had 
hired 5,000 extras to dress up in weird costumes and walk or skate up and down 
the beach. By weird, I mean indescribable. I suppose any one outfit might be 
described, if one had imagination enough, but trying to describe the whole 
scene would be beyond the powers of Tom Wolfe. Where do they buy those clothes? 
</P>
<P>
Someone recently sent me an ad from a department store catalogue advertising a 
pair of brand new blue jeans with several threadbare patches in them for $28. 
My wife said that was cheap. Most of the clothes the Venice strollers wore 
looked as if they might have been bought at one of the many open-air shops 
along the walk. The one almost indispensable garment was a T-shirt with a 
cynical or exuberant message. But that doesn't begin to suggest the creativity. 
</P>
<P>
We had meant to have lunch at the sidewalk cafe and bookstore, but there was a 
long waiting line. We found a deli inside an arcade of shops in an old relic 
from the 1920s and got a tuna salad sandwich, a ham sandwich, and two diet 
Cokes. We walked out to a green bench on the beach and sat down to eat. Someone 
had bought a tostada but evidently hadn't liked it. It lay on the bench beside 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Between us and the walk stood a little pyramid of articles whose purpose we 
could not guess. Two bowling balls, a trunk, half a dozen bowling pins, half a 
dozen machetes, a tape deck, two top hats, and assorted evidently unrelated 
objects. They were untended. I tried to imagine what their purpose might be. 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the beach crowds had gathered to watch one evidently spontaneous 
performance or another: a reggae concert, a team of acrobats, a magician. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly two young men appeared at the pile of junk in front of us. They didn't 
seem to know what they were doing. They picked up this and that and chattered 
incessantly. My wife and I had finished our sandwiches and were about to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The men were both in their early 20s. One was blond with metal-rimmed glasses, 
the other dark, perhaps Latino. Then they went out to the sidewalk and began 
entreating the strollers to form a crowd. I didn't think they had a chance. 
They seemed like frauds. Miraculously, a crowd began to form in a semicircle: a 
crowd that looked as if it had come from Mars. 
</P>

Gradually the lads went into their act. They were jugglers. They dragged in 
three reluctant stooges from the crowd, whom they placed in a line between 
them. Then they began to throw things back and forth between them, missing 
their patsies by inches. 
</P>
<P>
They threw bowling pins, machetes, flaming torches, six or more at a time, 
spinning them between their legs, over their heads, keeping up their patter. 
They were breathtaking. We found ourselves spellbound, then laughing 
helplessly. Finally they passed out the hats. We gave them $3. I asked their 
names. The blond said, "Sean and Robert. Two good Irish names." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, Los Angeles. Land of the Big Chance. Today, Venice, tomorrow, TV.

'BRIEF HISTORY' MAKES SOME OF ITS OWN AFTER 2 YEARS AS BEST SELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally, the nonfiction marketplace was a black hole for science books. 
Simplistic self-help books, cooking guides and glitz-biographies regularly 
ascended to publishing superstardom. The egghead stuff disappeared into a 
cultural cosmic void. 
</P>
<P>
Then a gnomish University of Cambridge theoretical physicist wrote a book about 
the possible origins of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Stephen W. Hawking's "A Brief History of Time -- from the Big Bang 
to Black Holes," celebrates its second year -- 104 weeks -- on the New York 
Time's best-seller list. That is astronomical success for any book, but it's a 
particularly quirky achievement for a serious book about quarks, quantum 
mechanics and particle physics. 
</P>
<P>
Disabled by the neurological disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or Lou 
Gehrig's disease), Hawking is confined to a wheelchair and to a body that 
provides only minimal support to his celebrated brain. By most informed 
estimations, he will be ranked alongside scientific luminaries such as Sir 
Issac Newton and Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is simple," Hawking once said. "It is complete understanding of the 
universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all." 
</P>
<P>
But shortly before "A Brief History" hit the bookstores in 1988, Hawking was 
less grand in his explanation of why he wrote a layman's book discussing those 
lofty matters. Speaking with a computerized voice that he laboriously activates 
with a small joy-stick, and flashing the lopsided, devilish grin that has 
become his trademark, he said: "I want to see it displayed in airport 
bookstores." 
</P>
<P>
"We always thought the book would do well," said Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman 
for Bantam. But no one had a clue to just how well. The book is now in its 37th 
printing, and with the 1.2 million hardcover copies still selling briskly at 
$18.95 there are no foreseeable plans for a paperback release, Applebaum said. 
</P>
<P>
With Steven Spielberg currently co-producing a 90-minute nonfiction film based 
on the book -- with Hawking playing himself -- its potential for continued 
success seems infinite. 
</P>
<P>
Hawking has attributed his book's popularity to people's natural curiosity 
about the universe they inhabit, and the fact that he left out the complex 
equations of his craft, making it accessible to readers who are not 
astrophysicists. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and publishers, meanwhile, have found hope in the public's growing 
appetite for books about hard science. As Applebaum remarked: "Remember the old 
H. L. Mencken dictum, 'No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence 
of the American people?' The success of Stephen Hawking's book is a wonderful 
rebuttal to that sort of cynicism."

Atwater at Home: The phone rang in the home of GOP chief of staff Mary Matalin 
at 6:45 a.m. "Hey, what's movin'?" asked Republican party chairman Lee Atwater. 
Atwater is back home after a New York hospital stay and hungry for the latest 
political news. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis after treating his "aggressive and dangerous" brain tumor won't 
be known for about three months, said Dr. Paul Kornblith. 
</P>
<P>
Blacklisted: Blacks have given President George Bush the highest level of 
sustained approval for any Republican President in 30 years, a New York 
Times/CBS News poll released Friday said. Fifty-six percent of blacks approved 
of the job Bush was doing; 26% disapproved. "He's fair, compared to the last 
one we had," Lawson Kilgore, a Cincinnati-area clerk told the Times.

Evangelist's Fall: Billy Graham, 71, was hospitalized last week in Rochester, 
Minn., so doctors could remove part of a rib he injured in a fall about a month 
ago. The evangelist has had problems with his ribs after suffering two earlier 
falls. He was in stable condition Friday.

TV Ferment: Yulia Sukhanova, the first Miss U.S.S.R., is capitalizing on her 
pageant victory by making a yogurt commercial for U.S. TV. "She wanted to 
dispel American attitudes that Russian women aren't beautiful," said Tricia 
Erickson, owner of the McLean, Va.-based modeling agency handling the 
17-year-old's career.

REDISCOVERING TOMLIN'S ART IN 'INTELLIGENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trudy's back and Lily's got her. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't just a flip way of telling you that Lily Tomlin has returned to town 
with what may be the last opportunity (lucky you) to see her one-woman "The 
Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe" at the Wilshire Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
It's a flip way of letting on that under the laughs and the puzzled brow of 
that intergalactic bag lady, Trudy, is one of the wisest and most enlightened 
comedy shows to have come our way in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlin is not just a gloriously limber and terrific comedian. She also has a 
firm grasp on the truth that surrounds us and unsparingly informs her comedy 
with it. That's genius -- there, I've said it -- and true grace, which she has 
in abundance, inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
Notice the way she never loses track of who she is at the moment. First she's 
Trudy, that homeless iconoclast who used to be a creative consultant (who do 
you think suggested orange and aqua to Howard Johnson's?), but now consults 
strictly with those aliens from outer space in search of that intelligent life 
of the title. 
</P>
<P>
Trudy's got the New Age language down pat (living is "a bio-hazard" and her 
body a "bio-container"). Her office is her sleeves, covered in Post-Its ("I 
gotta get this data collated"). The rest of her apparel leaves something to be 
desired, hobbled as she is by panty hose she likes to wear rolled down to the 
ankles -- and capped by the umbrella hat that serves as a dish to connect her 
to her "space chums." "Goin' crazy was the best thing that ever happened to 
me," she ruminates. "Frankly, it came at a time when nothing else was working 
for me. . . ." And since reality is "nothing more than a collective hunch," who 
needs it? 
</P>
<P>
Flip doesn't belong in a review of the gallery of precise characters we meet 
not exactly through Trudy, but somewhere in her widespread electromagnetic 
field. These are serious people with impairments we instantly recognize. 
</P>
<P>
Take 15-year-old Agnus -- her parents would love it if you would; they've 
changed the locks on her. This pink-haired punk rebel and aspiring performance 
artist is so heavily leathered and zippered and chained that she trips her 
grandparents' electrified garage door whenever she approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Agnus wants to be different, but so does everyone else. What's a rebel to do? 
Scream and convince her grandparents they have a terrorist for a grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
Take bored, affluent Kate (she just might enjoy that as a "different" 
experience), so bored that she finds somebody else's lost suicide note an 
object of endless speculation. Imagine, losing a suicide note. The ultimate 
failure. The note could be Chrissy's, the aerobics freak who's so scared of 
everything else that she'd consider suicide. If only she wasn't so scared. 
</P>
<P>
Take Brandy and Tina (everyone else does). For fifty bucks a shot they're happy 
to show you a good time. But Tina knows where to draw the line. The cruising 
screenwriter who picks them up and wants to turn on the tape recorder so he can 
use their chatter in his next script is where. Fifty dollars gets you fun, but 
hey, those are Brandy's and Tina's words. They could write their own script, 
thank you, and that's gotta be worth a lot more than $50. 
</P>
<P>
In the show's longest and most penetrating segment, we revisit women's lib via 
four women -- Lyn, Marge, Edie and Pam -- and a garage sale at which memories 
get discounted with the discarded mementos of a passing time. It is the 
evolution and devolution of a movement and a marriage -- or rather two 
marriages, one heterosexual, the other homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
This sequence has to be savored in the theater for its diversity, its 
astuteness, its wry humor and bittersweetness. "If I'd known having it all was 
going to be like this, I might have settled for less," observes Lyn the 
feminist, wife, mother, executive and now jobless divorcee, who once lived by 
the golden rule: "Wear something around the neck that looks sort of like a 
scarf, sort of like a tie and sort of like a ruffle and doesn't threaten 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Tomlin never misses a beat skipping from one character to another, one voice to 
another, one mind-set to another. She's a thrill to watch and is flawlessly 
aided by a sound score (uncredited here, but last attributed to Bruce Cameron) 
that picks up on every mimed possibility: the sound of Agnus' chains, of Trudy 
biting into an apple, of Lyn pulling the Kleenex out of a box. 
</P>
<P>
Connections also are made among all the characters, and many of their lines, 
written by the equally ineffable Jane Wagner, are aphorisms that stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to be politically conscious and upwardly mobile at the same time," 
says Lyn. "I am sick of being the victim of trends I reflect," mutters Kate (or 
was it Chrissy?). "He listened with an intensity most people have only when 
talking," says Lyn of her new-found future husband, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the field for witticisms reverts to Trudy, who makes quite a 
production throughout of distinguishing (not idly) between soup and art and 
philosophizing on nothing less than the meaning of life: "If life is 
meaningless, why bring up the subject? If life is meaningless, this discussion 
is even more so. This is so typical of what I do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Tomlin is about to commit this fun and folly to film and insists that this is 
the show's last hurrah on stage. If you haven't seen it, here's your chance. If 
you have, seeing it twice (as did this writer, who also caught it at the 
Doolittle Theatre in 1986) only deepens the experience. 
</P>
<P>
At 8440 Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
matinee Saturdays at 2 p.m. and Sundays at 3, until April 29. $15-$37.50; (213)

'CHINA BEACH' CAUGHT IN MORE RATINGS CROSS-FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMMING: ABC'S AWARD-WINNING SERIES ABOUT THE WOMEN OF VIETNAM MOVES TO A 
NEW TIME SLOT TONIGHT -- AND IT COULD BE ITS FINAL BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Call it the Network Battle for Monday Night. Or, maybe, McMurphy's Last Stand. 
</P>
<P>
ABC tonight moves Nurse Colleen McMurphy, K. C., Dr. Dick Richard, Pvt. Sam 
Beckett and the rest of the "China Beach" bivouac to 9 p.m., opposite the two 
strongest shows in CBS' otherwise tarnished comedy lineup: "Murphy Brown" and 
"Designing Women." And adding heat to the ratings cross-fire, NBC moves its 
action hit "Hunter" to the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC and NBC moves are part of efforts to help the launches of new series, 
but, for ABC's 3-year-old drama about the women of the Vietnam War, tonight's 
move could mean it's last chance in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
The critically acclaimed, marginally rated show has been in intensive care for 
months, and the move to a time period already dominated by shows with similar 
audience appeal could kill it. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, it's not where we want to be," said executive producer John Sacret 
Young. "Our fear is that the Monday night audience we're playing to is people 
who watch 'Murphy Brown' and 'Designing Women.' The audience is similar to ours 
and the shows are somewhat similar to ours." 
</P>
<P>
"We understand 'Murphy Brown' and 'Designing Women' both have strong female 
appeal, but they are by no means runaway hits," countered Ted Harbert, an ABC 
Entertainment executive vice president for prime time. "The way you go after 
the audience is with very different and strong counterprogramming to that." 
</P>
<P>
According to Harbert, "China Beach" was moved in part because ABC had a large 
inventory of 10 p.m. shows that were not needed early in the season but that 
the network wanted to air. "Equal Justice," a drama about prosecuting 
attorneys, was given "China Beach's" 10 p.m. time slot. 
</P>
<P>
A second reason was to promote the new newspaper drama, "Capital News," which 
follows "China Beach" tonight at 10. 
</P>
<P>
"The move of 'China Beach' is a signal of how strongly we feel about it," said 
Harbert. "We wanted to start 9 p.m. off with a show with audience loyalty. 
Putting two new shows there was a risk that would not have been prudent." 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost mysterious," says producer Young. "We don't have the choice in the 
game of Russian roulette that you play in the programming of time slots. We 
just try to do the best shows we can." 
</P>
<P>
But "China Beach" presents ABC with a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic series is generally considered a good, high-quality show. Its 
popular star Dana Delany took the Emmy last year for best actress in a dramatic 
series. The show picked up the Golden Globe award for best dramatic television 
series this year. Critics give it good marks. 
</P>
<P>
But the ratings for the series have been, at best, marginal. It ranks just 61st 
out of 107 Big Three network shows broadcast this season. But the show 
regularly topped its Wednesday night competition -- NBC's "Quantum Leap" and 
"Wiseguy" on CBS. And, just as important, the series was the time period's most 
popular among men and women in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 age group. 
</P>
<P>
" 'China Beach' is the leader among women 18 to 49," said Harbert, "that's the 
overriding demographic we're looking for. That's its strongest selling point, 
along with the quality of the show." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, after ABC announced that "China Beach" would be placed on hiatus 
and then moved to Monday, fans were outraged. They wrote ABC asking that it not 
kill the series. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no way to treat a Golden Globe and Emmy winner that's held its own in 
the ratings for 2 1/2 years," said supporter Dorothy Swanson, founder of 
Viewers for Quality Television, a Fairfax, Va.-based group that lobbies the 
networks for better programming. The series ranked first in a season-long 
member survey of TV best shows. 
</P>
<P>
"There are nights you can't find anything worth watching," said Swanson, "but 
to put one quality show against two others isn't the way to win back viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson's 3,500-member group and the American Assn. of Critical-Care Nurses are 
fostering letter-writing campaigns to help "China Beach" win a renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The nursing organization sent its 66,000 members a letter encouraging them to 
voice their opinions to the network in hopes of saving the series. 
</P>
<P>
" 'China Beach' shows that nurses have knowledge, caring and compassion and yet 
are real people," said association president Suzanne K. White. "That's 
important for the public and young people to see. 'China Beach' is based on how 
nurses really respond and it portrays to young people that nursing is an 
important, worthwhile profession." 
</P>
<P>
The series even has friends at the network. 
</P>
<P>
" 'China Beach' has got a lot of fans over here," said Harbert. " 'China Beach' 
is under heavy, heavy consideration. We want to find every way we can to bring 
it back." 
</P>
<P>
Harbert said "China Beach's" rating performance in its new time period will not 
figure into ABC's decision to renew it. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair to use Monday night, because it wouldn't be there in the 
fall because that's when we have football," Harbert said. "We'll be evaluating 
the 20 original episodes from Wednesday night. As an incumbent, 'China Beach' 
has better odds than a new show because we know how it performs and it is a 
show of high quality." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's episode will allow new viewers will get a chance to catch-up with 
some character history. Usually set in 1968, "China Beach" moves back to 1966 
in tonight's episode, beginning with McMurphy enlisting in the Army, continuing 
through basic training and her first days at China Beach.

POP MUSIC: TWO HARVARD SENIORS COMBINE THEIR LOVE OF BLACK CULTURE AND MUSIC TO 
PUBLISH THE SOURCE -- 'THE VOICE OF THE RAP MUSIC INDUSTRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officially, Harvard University senior David Mays is majoring in government. 
According to university records, Mays' roommate, Jon Shecter, also a senior, is 
concentrating in English. 
</P>
<P>
But the truth is that the two 21-year-olds are majoring in rap, with a minor in 
entrepreneurialism. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it's the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
Mays and Shecter, friends since the day early on in their freshman year when 
they discovered their mutual love for black culture and music, are publisher 
and editor-in-chief, respectively, of The Source, a monthly magazine they 
immodestly describe as "the voice of the rap music industry." 
</P>
<P>
That view apparently extends within the rap music industry as well, where one 
national executive called The Source "the hippest, dopest, freshest thing to 
happen to the rap community in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Before The Source, "Anything else that was out there dealing with rap tended to 
be very teeny-bopper oriented, you know, 'Win a Date With Slick Rick,' " 
Shecter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Very superficial," Mays agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the need for a serious publication that took rap music seriously," 
Shecter said. "Something that dealt with social and political issues as well as 
personalities." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in August, 1988, as a free, one-page newsletter that was launched with 
$200 of their own money and printed on Mays' MacIntosh computer in their dorm 
room at Harvard's Cabot House, The Source is now a glossy, $1.95-per-issue, 
full-color magazine with national advertisements and a circulation of 12,000. 
Its contributors have included former Georgia State Sen. Julian Bond, as well 
as a coast-to-coast network of reporters. While its founders are negotiating to 
put The Source on newsstands, the magazine is available mostly through record 
stores. It is sold in Canada, England, Australia, Holland and Italy as well as 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Their success has earned Mays and Shecter a staff of six, all fellow Harvard 
students, a cluttered, $750-per-month office in nearby Somerville and plans to 
move their venture to New York when they graduate in June. They say they see no 
reason why one year from now, The Source should not have a circulation of 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the need that existed, and we went out and did it," Shecter said. "Each 
of us has always been the type of person who has not let our age stop us. We've 
always looked at the real world as something we could conquer, so our age -- 
being young -- was never an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly escalated from the ranks of mere Ivy League undergraduates to 
potential music media barons, the two exhibit the kind of confident ambition 
that invites comparison to a music journalism Wunderkind of a generation ago: 
Jan Wenner. 
</P>
<P>
But when the name of the founder and publisher of Rolling Stone is mentioned, 
Mays and Shecter look blank. 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" they finally ask politely. 
</P>
<P>
If the history of contemporary rock journalism is not their forte, a sense of 
business acumen obviously is. Shecter worked in urban radio while still a high 
school student in Philadelphia. Mays, a product of the public school system in 
Washington, arrived at Harvard with a love for black music. By January of their 
freshman year, the two were co-hosting a weekly show about rap, "Street Beat," 
on the Harvard student station, WHRB. 
</P>
<P>
In his sophomore year, Shecter cut a rap single of his own, "B.O.M.C.," that 
spoofed the old Joe College stereotype. Mays, meanwhile, was managing a local 
rap group. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the line, Mays got the idea of "building up a mailing list of 
our listeners." Shecter thought he was crazy, Mays said; "He'd say, 'what're 
you doing that for?' " But though he still wasn't sure exactly what he would 
use the list for, "I knew it would be valuable," Mays said. "I spent like every 
hour of our show writing down names and telephone numbers." 
</P>
<P>
That list became the basis for the first subscription roster of The Source, 
named for a phrase penned by rap songwriter Kris Parker, better known as KRS-1. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'If you want to hear fresh rhyme, come to The Source,' " Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Shecter's own description of the average rap music fan as "a 16- to 23-year-old 
black male" makes these two white Harvard undergraduates something of an 
anomaly in a world of music that often blasts whites for their treatment of 
African Americans and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many people here white or black are really into black music," Shecter 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I think it's anomalous not so much that we are into rap, but 
that we are actually running a business that is part of the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Still, they remain sensitive to the suggestion that they are two white kids out 
to make a buck on a black musical phenomenon. Both come from professional 
families; their fathers are lawyers, Shecter's mother is a psychologist and 
Mays' mother is a graphic designer who applied for the job of designing The 
Source but was turned down by the editor and publisher. They are students at a 
school whose annual tuition costs considerably more than many inner-city 
families could dream of earning in a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Shecter insists that "this is not a bunch of white people sitting around 
writing about rap music. This is a coalition of all races, people who love and 
respect the music and the culture it comes from.

"We want to make money, sure," he continued, "but we don't want to forget what 
we are doing. We always want to be conscious that this is a black art form. We 
see rap as a major social movement that offers empowerment to African-American 
people. We want to stay involved in the kind of social activism that goes along 
with rap."

Running the magazine has caused Mays and Shecter to rearrange their academy 
priorities somewhat. To the dismay of their mothers, neither one will be headed 
to law school next year. Mays still expects to graduate with honors; Shecter 
rolls his eyes behind Giorgio Armani eyeglasses and adds, "We hope." 
</P>
<P>
More important to them right now is the music they call "so cool, so raw, so 
danceable." 
</P>
<P>
Today, say Shecter and Mays, rap. 
</P>
<P>
And tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
"More rap."

SENDAK'S PICTURESQUE 'ZAUBERFLOTE'

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program magazine at the Civic Theatre on Saturday heralded Mozart's "Magic 
Flute." But the San Diego Opera presented no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse -- probably worse -- this was "Die Zauberflote." It was 
performed with even more German dialogue than one normally encounters in 
American houses. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, there wasn't a single German on the stage. There cannot have been 
many Germans out front. Most of the cast bumbled and stumbled through the long 
evening in what might just as well have been phonetic Dogpatch-Croatian while 
the audience followed inept supertitles. Responding to faulty cues, the dutiful 
readers constantly laughed in the wrong places. 
</P>
<P>
At one significant point in the second act, David Malis -- the affable, 
wide-eyed Papageno -- lapsed purposely into a single English punch line. He 
earned an instant ovation for his effort. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been sensible and, yes, unsnobbish, if the guardians of operatic 
virtue in San Diego had utilized a decent translation for the whole 
performance. Unfortunately, they don't seem to think in terms of direct 
artistic communication. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't afraid of thinking in terms of old-fashioned hucksterism, however. 
Before the overture could begin, Ian Campbell, general director of the company, 
stepped before the curtain to deliver a shameless pitch to the sold-out house 
regarding ticket sales. He must consider his patrons yahoos. 
</P>
<P>
When the curtain finally rose, a welcome aura of taste, even charm, descended. 
Chief credit for this belonged to Maurice Sendak, whose wily storybook sets had 
been borrowed from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1980 in conjunction with the director Frank Corsaro, the painted 
flats reduced the opera to a children's fantasy about wild things. As such, the 
designs slighted the pathos, the heroism and the spirituality that Mozart and 
his librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder, fused with the obvious comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was difficult to resist the fabulous flora and adorable fauna, the 
ever-inventive symbolism, the dark-edged cartoon whimsy and the clever 
mock-Egyptian accents of Sendak's unkitschy illustrations. If only they could 
sing. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who did sing in this not particularly mellifluous ensemble, Malis 
stole the show, as Papagenos usually do. He used his pliant, lightweight 
baritone with welcome finesse. Abandoning the cliche of the cutesy bird-man, he 
played Papageno as a happy fool, a bucolic everyboy who won his laughs with wit 
that stopped well short of buffoonery. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining principals might have seemed less bland with a conductor who 
insisted on greater dynamic sensitivity or broader flexibility in phrasing. 
Karen Keltner seemed content to accompany the singers tactfully and to beat 
time briskly. In this opera, efficiency and accommodation aren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Denes Gulyas offered a Hungarian-accented Tamino whose sweet lyric tenor tended 
to become harsh under pressure. Hei-Kyung Hong complemented him as a 
hard-toned, monochromatic Pamina. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Sublett, the unmenacing Queen of the Night, squeaked out her top Fs 
with a slender soprano more appropriate for Papagena -- a role deftly 
dispatched here by Sylvia Wen. At the opposite end of the scale, Kenneth Cox 
snarled gruffly as a Sarastro demoted from high priest to Masonic boss. 
</P>
<P>
Best of the supporting players was Anthony Laciura, a mildly mean Monostatos 
who executed some nifty disco-aerobics when he heard the silver bells. Herbert 
Eckhoff, a reasonably dignified baritonal Speaker, was given more to speak than 
tradition dictates. 
</P>
<P>
The trio of attendants to the Queen (Joan Gibbons, Gale Fuller and Deidra 
Palmour) blended competently. However, one had to regret Campbell's decision to 
send in three additional women to do what should be boys' work as the Genii. 
</P>
<P>
Confronting hand-me-down decors as well as a prefabricated dramatic concept, 
Wolfgang Weber moved the characters and motivated the action with informed 
restraint. He told the story clearly, without pomp, gimmicky or undue ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The director could not be held responsible, of course, for the revisionism of 
the supertitles, borrowed from San Francisco. The text on the proscenium screen 
was sanitized when Papageno made his racist remark about the moor, Monostatos. 
The words disappeared altogether when the Speaker uttered his sexist 
pejoratives about the reliability of women. 
</P>
<P>
So much for truth in translation.

Norris a Kick in Boat Race: Chuck Norris piloted a 50-foot speedboat to victory 
in a weekend offshore powerboat race, and a second actor-laden boat came in 
fourth. Norris, the star of "Missing in Action" and "Delta Force," averaged 
81.2 m.p.h. in the 140-mile super-boat class of the 1990 Offshore Powerboat 
Races. Fellow tough-guy actors Don Johnson and Kurt Russell were aboard the 
fourth-place boat, "Team USA." GREG BRAXTON

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: MORE TREASURES IN KUROSAWA RETROSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among this week's offerings in the comprehensive Kurosawa retrospective at the 
Little Tokyo Cinemas are three infrequently revived films: "High and Low" 
(1963, today and Tuesday), "Red Beard" (1965, today through Wednesday) and 
"Dodes'ka-den" (1970, Wednesday through Friday). 
</P>
<P>
In "High and Low," Ed McBain's 87th Precinct mystery "King's Ransom" provides 
an ideal starting point for Kurosawa's study of a man who must measure the 
extent of his responsibility to others in a society with a huge gulf between 
the haves and have-nots. Toshiro Mifune stars as a Yokohama shoe manufacturer 
who has just arranged a 50-million-yen loan in order to gain control of his 
corporation. His phone rings and a kidnaper (Tsutomu Yamazaki, more recently 
the star of Juzo Itami comedies) demands the very same amount in ransom for his 
only son. That the kidnaper has taken the son of the chauffeur by mistake only 
makes the manufacturer's situation worse: must he face financial ruin in order 
to save the life of another man's child? 
</P>
<P>
Structurally, the film, shot in a superbly evocative black-and-white, is 
venturesome. As soon as the manufacturer comes to his decision, he literally 
drops out of the picture until almost the end. Kurosawa then concentrates on 
the police search for the kidnaper. The camera itself replaces the familiar, 
dominating figure of Mifune as it relentlessly probes the crowded slums and 
amusement areas of Yokohama in sequences reminiscent of similar passages in 
"Stray Dog" and "Ikiru." "Red Beard" is a film of breathtaking beauty, 
extraordinary emotional impact and profound significance that dares to affirm 
that the individual does indeed possess the capacity to transform the lives of 
others -- and thus his own life -- through love. It is Kurosawa's supreme 
accomplishment that he convincingly portrays good overcoming evil. The time is 
the 1860s, just as Japan is opening up to the world. Toshiro Mifune stars as a 
tough-minded doctor known as "Red Beard" who runs a clinic for the poor in Edo 
and who takes in hand a new assistant (Yuzo Kayama), a proud young graduate. 
</P>
<P>
A drama of a shantytown community alongside a dump outside a large city, 
perhaps Tokyo itself, "Dodes'ka-den," adapted from Shugoro Yamamoto's "The Town 
Without Seasons," unblinkingly embraces humanity in all its strength and folly, 
love and hatred, comedy and tragedy, to make a profound affirmation of life. 
Its title translates as "Clickety-clack," which is what a mentally retarded 
youth keeps repeating to himself as he chugs up and down a path cleared amid 
debris, operating an imaginary streetcar. Information: (213) 687-7077. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA Film Archive's retrospective "Directed by Michael Curtiz" continues 
Thursday at 5:30 p.m. with "20,000 Years in Sing Sing" (1933), an early prison 
melodrama and the only film Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis made together. 
</P>
<P>
The 7:30 double bill, "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) and "Doctor X" (1932), 
features just about the last two-strip Technicolor films ever produced. With 
virtually identical casts and crews, both are durably entertaining, as is so 
often the case with Curtiz films. In the first, Lionel Atwill plays a 
tragically disfigured proprietor of a wax museum whose statues seem 
exceptionally lifelike. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. X" is a familiar mad-scientist tale that today seems hokey rather than 
spooky. But if it sounds corny, it looks great. Information: (213) 206-8013, 
206-FILM.

MCCULLOCH STANDS FIRM AT THE EMBASSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick as some of the tempos tended to be, Ian McCulloch was the very model of 
immobility for most of his show on Friday at the Embassy Theatre -- both hands 
on the mike stand, both feet planted squarely at its base, eyes closed, 
overhead lighting illuminating his inverted pyramid of poufy hair but hardly 
ever his apparently expressionless face. He's like a very shy and/or very 
drowsy Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
McCulloch's introversion actually serves him well on record. His first solo 
album since quitting Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, "Candleland," is frequently 
touching even in its vaguest moments, with emotions of despair and honest 
contrition that ring deep, dark, true and occasionally even optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
But the record's resurrectional potential seemed lost in this downcast Good 
Friday concert -- its uneven musical textures reduced to a jangly Euro-rock 
blur, the thematically obscure lyrics rendered sonically obscure as well, 
leaving only the much hook-ier handful of Bunnymen hits that were brought back 
from the grave to make much impression. His very private vision is best 
experienced at home. CHRIS WILLMAN

HAMMOND QUINTET AT ROXY'S IMPROVISES ON THE STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jazz finally seems to have found a sturdy outpost in the wild reaches of the 
west San Fernando Valley. Roxy's, in Woodland Hills' new Hilton Hotel, recently 
inaugurated a five-night-a-week jazz policy featuring some of the Southland's 
finest players. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, the spacious, casually comfortable room showcased an ensemble 
led by pianist John Hammond (who also doubles as Roxy's music director). The 
group -- which included all-star hornmen Ray Pizzi on tenor saxophone and Steve 
Hufsteder on trumpet and flugelhorn, with Luther Hughes on bass and Bob 
Leatherbarrow on drums -- used a group of standards as the takeoff point for a 
set of first-rate jazz improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond provided a great deal of the initial energy via his solid piano 
accompaniments. Although he is not an aggressive soloist, his moments in the 
spotlight resulted in a series of well-conceived, often slyly humorous 
variations. 
</P>
<P>
Hufsteder's playing resonated with the gorgeous, bell-like high notes that are 
his trademark; his solos on "Green Dolphin Street" and "Days of Wine and Roses" 
were crafted with the delicate precision and flawless purity of a Lalique 
crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzi's style was far different. His horn exuded sounds ranging from multinote 
smears and low register honks to high harmonics and energetic shouts. In sharp 
contrast to Hufsteder's crystalline precision, Pizzi was a musical Van Gogh, 
his solos bursting forth in great, whirling gusts of light and color. 
</P>
<P>
On "It Could Happen to You," he applied rich, new brush strokes to the song's 
familiar chords. When a request was made for "Danny Boy," he transformed a song 
viewed by many musicians as a worn-out chestnut into a passionate, 
gospel-tinged, improvisational sermon. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythm team of Leatherbarrow and Hughes, working unobtrusively but 
supportively, laid down a foundation that made it possible for Hammond, 
Hufsteder and Pizzi to soar freely. 
</P>
<P>
The John Hammond Quintet appears every Friday at Roxy's. Various other jazz 
groups can be heard Tuesday through Saturday nights. DON HECKMAN

'WORKING GIRL' TITLE IS EMPLOYED, PLOT IS NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In name, at least, that nice little movie "Working Girl" now continues life as 
an NBC sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"Working Girl" the series premieres at 8:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, 
starting a six-episode trial and starring Sandra Bullock in the Tess McGill 
role that boosted Melanie Griffith into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the title and familiar theme, not a lot survives from the 
Oscar-nominated movie about an underestimated secretary who outsmarts her 
selfish and insecure boss to advance in the business world. That part of the 
story is capsulized in the premiere, although in somewhat different 
circumstances. Meanwhile, ensuing episodes will contrast Tess at the office 
with Tess at home. 
</P>
<P>
Although this first program is nothing you'd want to build a night around, it's 
pleasant enough, with Bullock doing a nice job as Tess (an improvement over 
Nancy McKeon, who played the role in an unaired earlier pilot). Tess remains 
bright and ambitious while, in this version, having to cope now with a set of 
parents and the advances of a playboy who lives in her apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere is at its best when involving George Newbern as Tess' amusingly 
preppy and sniveling colleague and especially Nan Visitor as Tess' 
high-powered-but-insecure boss Bryn Newhouse, who must undergo an illogical 
lapse in nastiness so that Tess can attain her goal of becoming a junior 
executive. More often than not, however, most of the laughs are junior too.

'DAVID BROWER,' 'PROFIT' FOLLOW EARTH DAY THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stewardship of the planet Earth can take many forms. Hewing to this week's 
Earth Day theme, PBS devotes two documentaries tonight to close-up looks at 
environmentalists in action, but the portraits could hardly be more different 
in tone. 
</P>
<P>
"For Earth's Sake: The Life and Times of David Brower" (9 p.m. on Channels 28 
and 15, 10 p.m. Channel 24) sketches the career of a traditional 
environmentalist who has been compared to Thoreau and John Muir in the scope of 
his dedication to saving nature from the ravages of industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
"Profit the Earth" (8 p.m. on Channels 15 and 50, 9 p.m. on Channel 24, 10 p.m. 
on Channel 28) introduces a new group of activists who break through the old 
stereotypes of "bad-guy" industrial polluters -- insisting that we can't afford 
to clean up the Earth -- versus "good-guy" environmentalists retorting that we 
can't afford not to. 
</P>
<P>
The new activists have abandoned the confrontational tools of protest and 
lawsuits to work within the economy, seeking creative ways to reshape the free 
enterprise system so that everybody wins. "The new environmentalists," 
proclaims the narrator, "are giving the word 'profit' a new meaning." 
</P>
<P>
In juxtaposition, the two shows present an effective snippet of contemporary 
history at what seems to be a pivotal moment of change. 
</P>
<P>
David Brower, now 77, who has headed both the Sierra Club and Friends of the 
Earth, is the quintessential model of an Industrial Age environmentalist, 
waging battles to save lakes from being dammed and redwoods from being 
destroyed. John de Graaf's documentary captures both the personal passion of 
the man ("the environment was all he wanted to talk about at the dinner table," 
says his son) and the grandeur of the wilderness Brower has spent his life 
protecting. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "Profit the Earth" focuses on men and women who are replacing the 
traditional "battle" language and tactics with problem solving. They are 
environmental entrepreneurs, a diverse and fascinating lot whose common trait 
is the ability to view old problems with new perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the new environmentalists are economists with the Environmental Defense 
Fund. In California, Zach Willey is completing a complex plan for thirsty Los 
Angeles to buy surplus water from farmers instead of diverting it from Mono 
Lake. In Washington, Dan Dudek is lobbying for an emission-trading provision in 
the Clean Air Act that would "make industry a partner, not a foe," in cutting 
acid rain emission by allowing industries that fall below the government-set 
pollution limit to sell its leftover allotment for a profit to another 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some businesses are small scale: Gene Anderson of Seattle who runs a reusable 
cloth diaper service, but realizes that disposable diapers are a major 
contribution to the nation's landfill problem, is recycling disposable diapers, 
sanitizing the plastic and marketing it for new products. 
</P>
<P>
Others are large: At Minnesota's 3M Company, which manufactures 60,000 products 
and accounts for 2% of the nation's industrial pollution, a stringent program 
for redesigning products and recycling has cut 450,000 tons of pollution and 
saved a half a billion dollars in 15 years. "Profit the Earth," produced by the 
Nebraska ETV Network, does not pretend that the new environmentalists have a 
handle on solving the planetary crisis. But it does focus on an emerging energy 
and optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have tapped a millioneth of our potential as a society," says 
Dan Dudek. That's not a bad message for Earth Day.CONNIE KOENENN

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gun drawn, the man entered Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, walked 15 steps down 
a corridor to the small emergency room and confronted two nurses seated at a 
long, white desk. 
</P>
<P>
The man spoke twice. "You killed my father!" he screamed, then asked, "Who's 
the physician on duty?" Up came the .22-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency room, with fewer than a dozen staff members and only two patients 
and their families inside, erupted in gunfire, chaos, screams and blood. Two 
were killed; two were injured. 
</P>
<P>
An hour after the shootings Saturday afternoon, Bradford Warren Powers Jr., 46, 
of La Jolla surrendered to police. Booked on suspicion of two counts of murder 
and two counts of assault, Powers, described by a neighbor as having 
experienced "emotional difficulties" in the past, is being held in San Diego 
County Jail. He is expected to be arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that he embarked on the murderous rampage at Mission Bay 
Memorial in reaction to the death hours earlier in the hospital emergency room 
of his father, Brad Powers Sr., a well-known architectural illustrator. The 
younger Powers was there when his father died during an operation and, 
according to police, returned to the emergency room eight hours later, about 
4:45 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Based on interviews with police and witnesses, including one of the wounded, 
the following sequence of events then unfolded: 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year emergency room nurse Deborah Kay Burke, 36, soon to leave on a 
European vacation, was one of the two nurses the gunman initially encountered. 
She tried to scramble under her chair, but was shot once in the chest. Bleeding 
and confused, she ran outside and pleaded with occupants of a car in the 
parking lot to drive her to another hospital. The people in the car, confused 
and frightened themselves, pointed back at Mission Bay Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Burke fled around the side of the hospital and ran back inside. She tried to 
grab a telephone but collapsed on the floor. She died of her wound about two 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Thomas Rooney, 30, a student observer working his first day at the 
hospital as an emergency medical technician, was confronted by the gunman and 
shot twice as he and Dr. Michael Hughes treated an elderly woman in the middle 
bed of the hospital's three-bed emergency room. Rooney fell to the floor after 
suffering his first wound, only to have the gunman walk up, stand over him and 
shoot him again, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 48, was wounded five times in the abdomen and thigh. Meanwhile, two 
nurses frantically herded a 2-year-old patient and her mother into a nearby 
bathroom, where they locked the door and prayed the gunman wouldn't find them. 
The little girl's father, Fred Mowrer, a 38-year-old attorney from Albuquerque 
vacationing with his family in San Diego, tried to help the wounded, then 
realized the gunman was aiming at him. 
</P>
<P>
Mowrer turned and ran. He was wounded in the buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't look like a crazy man," Mowrer said Sunday from his hotel room. He 
had been treated for his wound at Mission Bay Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mowrer, in describing the shooting scene, recalled most of all the frightening 
sight of the handgun. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at him and I saw the gun coming up," Mowrer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned to avoid him. I guess I thought I was giving him a smaller target. I 
didn't even know I was shot. I fell to the ground. I had just seen him shoot 
the other guy (Rooney) on the ground and thought, 'I am not going to let him do 
that to me.' I got to the phone and dialed 911." 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they feared the gunman was still inside and the entire 
three-story hospital was searched. But the gunman apparently had departed after 
wounding Mowrer. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:40 p.m. Saturday, about an hour after the killings began, Powers 
telephoned police from a pay phone in Oceanside, 40 miles north of the 
hospital. According to police, he said he wanted to surrender. Several police 
cars arrived within minutes and officers took him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, Powers lived with his parents on Castle Hills Drive, on 
the western slope of La Jolla's Mt. Soledad. His two children -- a son and a 
daughter -- also lived there. Powers' marital status could not be determined 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The green, ranch-style home was described by residents as "the envy of the 
neighborhood" for its ocean view, beautiful landscaping and front-yard pool. 
</P>
<P>
Powers was devoted to his father, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the nicest young men I've ever known," said Fern Pinches, a neighbor 
who has been acquainted with the family for 28 years. "He's never been anything 
but extremely polite." 
</P>
<P>
But she added: "I do know he's had from time to time emotional difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, who asked not to be identified, described another side of the 
younger Powers. "There were several family disturbances," the neighbor said. 
"And I've seen a number of police vehicles at the house over the past five or 
six years." 
</P>
<P>
Police could not confirm Sunday whether they had ever been called to the family 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harry Henderson, chief of staff-elect at Mission Bay Memorial, said the 
elder Powers was a frequent patient in the emergency room. Henderson described 
the 75-year-old Powers as suffering from heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said Powers came to the emergency room late Friday afternoon 
suffering shortness of breath. He was treated and released, but he returned by 
ambulance early Saturday with what had become severe abdominal pain. Doctors 
determined he was suffering from an abdominal aneurysm that was bursting and 
decided they had no choice but to operate, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers died on the operating table about 8:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
His son and other family members, who had come to hospital, were notified. 
Henderson said the younger Powers, whom he described as "upset and angry" upon 
arriving at the hospital, did not seem overly distraught. "But he was also 
concerned that his father had died, and he was concerned that something was not 
done appropriately" by the emergency room staff, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said Sunday that every effort had been made to save the 
elder Powers' life. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, the Kansas-born nurse who was killed, was described as very popular 
among the hospital's staff. She had wanted to donate a kidney to her ailing 
sister, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a heaven, Debbie is there," said one hospital volunteer, overcome 
with grief as he sat Sunday afternoon outside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney, the student trainee who hoped to become a paramedic, was engaged to be 
married in October, said Earl Parker, a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed was a great guy, a beautiful young man," Parker said. "It's just a tragedy. 
We're all having a hard time believing it." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was in good condition Sunday at Scripps Memorial Hospital. In a brief 
interview, he said: "I'm feeling better. I just don't want to talk." 
</P>
<P>
The emergency room was scheduled to reopen this morning. On Sunday, baskets of 
flowers lined the nurses' table. A sympathy card, written by hospital volunteer 
Betty Ditto, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I give blessings for this Easter morning. But my heart aches for yesterday's 
tragedy."

TAX NIGHT: More certain than swallows returning to Capistrano, taxpayers return 
to Orange County post offices tonight for the annual midnight filing deadline 
(B1). . . . They flock in biggest numbers to the postal center on Sunflower 
Avenue in Santa Ana, where it's worse than the whole Christmas season crammed 
into one night, said one postal official. . . . "At Christmas, at least you see 
a few smiling faces, but these people are not very happy. We all get snapped 
at," she said. . . . The whole event has become so big that KIIS-FM will 
broadcast live from the parking lot (6 to 10 p.m.). Steve Emmons and Gregory

ENVIRONMENT CONCERN COMES TO FORE IN O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISM: RECENT EVENTS HAVE SPARKED A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THE QUALITY OF 
LIFE -- AND SOME ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of being accused of having no environmental heartbeat, Orange 
County is showing signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach oil spill, malathion spraying over much of North County 
and final development plans for Laguna Canyon have all fueled public concern 
and spawned a new collection of activists -- even politicians -- pushing 
environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
Grumbling opposition has always existed to growth, offshore oil drilling and 
traffic congestion in Orange County, but only recently has this concern been 
forged into action. And environmentalists are already outlining a county 
environmental agenda for the 1990s that includes planting 1 million new trees, 
mandating recycling and banning or sharply reducing the use of ozone-depleting 
chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, people were generally in a state of bliss. Most folks were 
happy, pursuing the Orange County dream," said Brian Jacobs, chairman of the 
recently formed Orange County Environmental Coalition. "But now people are 
conscious of what is going on. They look around and realize this isn't the same 
place. And they are upset." 
</P>
<P>
Even state and federal lawmakers from the county are talking up environmental 
topics and issues. U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, the ultraconservative Garden 
Grove Republican, conceded that he has softened his stand on offshore oil 
drilling and now considers himself a moderate "Pete Wilson-style Republican" on 
some environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Developers too are feeling the heat. Billionaire Donald Bren found himself 
suddenly across the table from Laguna Beach environmentalists after activists 
last fall helped turn public opinion against his company's Laguna Laurel 
project. 
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 people marched against the proposed development at the mouth of 
Laguna Canyon, a winding chaparral-covered gorge leading to the famed art 
colony and the Pacific beyond. And many of the protesters were not from Laguna 
Beach -- a marked difference from past rallies and one of many signs that the 
environment is now an issue troubling residents across Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach activists in recent months have been enlisted to help rural 
residents east of Orange challenge another Irvine Co. proposal to build more 
than 12,000 homes on the edge of the county's dwindling backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
Anger and fear over malathion spraying to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly 
has spurred many otherwise passive residents to turn out at city halls and 
street corner demonstrations from Brea to Garden Grove to protest the aerial 
pesticide assault. 
</P>
<P>
And along the coast, scores of people -- mothers with small children, merchants 
and students -- flocked to the oil-fouled shores of Huntington Beach and 
Newport Beach in early February, volunteering to sop up the petroleum that 
spilled from the wounded tanker American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
But some observers wonder whether the rush to embrace environmental causes 
reflects genuine concern that will last in a county noted for its growth and 
consumption. Or will it slowly evaporate after next Sunday's nationwide 
observance of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day? 
</P>
<P>
Rallies and speeches decrying development, polluted air and failed leadership 
are not enough to sustain the movement, veteran environmentalists warn. Some 
even fear that once the hoopla and headlines surrounding Earth Day end, so 
might the surge in grass-roots interest in repairing the region's tattered 
environs. 
</P>
<P>
"Born-again environmentalists are sprouting everywhere in the spring sunshine," 
said Richard Arklin, a member of the radical environmental group Earth First!. 
"Right now, it's the thing to do. It's hip to sign up. Everybody is talking 
environment. But let's see how many stick with it. Remember what happened 20 
years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
After a burst of activism and unity following the first Earth Day in April, 
1970, Orange County's environmental movement splintered and by the early 1980s 
was nearly invisible. In a conservative county where President Reagan was 
revered, those who talked about excess and growth controls were not. The 
economy was expanding, traffic problems were still largely confined to 
rush-hour commutes and open space -- although disappearing -- was not yet a 
burning issue. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of single-issue groups, waging high-profile campaigns to protect 
upper Newport Bay, the Irvine Coast and the Bolsa Chica wetlands, home to 
several endangered bird species, carved out sizable followings. 
</P>
<P>
"Most environmentalists were in the closet," said Lorraine Faber, past 
president of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, a Huntington Beach-based group that has 
fought since the mid-1970s to preserve the Bolsa Chica wetlands. "There was a 
lot of environmental bashing going on. We were considered freaks bent on 
destroying Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
That changed. Concerns about quality of life increasingly preoccupied those 
living and working in a region where computer chips replaced citrus as a 
leading cash crop. By the late 1980s, the bubble had burst, and Orange County, 
for all its wealth and splendid weather, was choking on its own success. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding, clogged freeways and suburban sprawl had touched a nerve. Talking 
and acting environmental moved into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"People began encountering environmental issues on a daily basis," said Mark 
Chamberlain, a Laguna Beach photographer who has actively campaigned to halt 
development in Laguna Canyon. "They would wake up to watch stories about global 
warming on the morning news programs, then get on the freeway and drive 
bumper-to-bumper to work in the smog. The problems were inescapable and it 
finally started dawning on people." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Walkins, a Greenpeace activist, views the wave of new converts more 
cynically: "Propose a freeway, housing tract or shopping center in someone's 
back yard and watch how quickly he becomes an environmentalist." 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Brown, chairwoman of Laguna Greenbelt, credits Measure A, the 
countywide slow-growth initiative that was defeated in 1988, for igniting the 
environmental fires, particularly in South County. Even though the measure was 
defeated, 56% to 44%, it sent a message, she said, "that the masses were angry. 
They wanted business as usual to stop. The environment was now more important 
then new shopping centers, movie theaters and houses." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after the first Earth Day, observers such as political consultant 
Robert Nelson believe the county's environmental movement is on firmer footing. 
It has a better chance of sustaining itself, Nelson says, because of the 
county's robust economy and what he called the "environmental ethic" of the 
baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a long period of peace and prosperity, so most people aren't worried 
about war or finding a job. Their attention has turned to other things, like 
the environment," said Nelson of Nelson/Ralston/Robb Communications in Costa 
Mesa. The environmental bug was bound to bite Orange County because, he said, 
"concern is highest among educated people, like baby boomers, who were raised 
with a greater sensitivity to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"And baby boomers are running this county now." 
</P>
<P>
Activists are better equipped today to tap new recruits. After years of waging 
lopsided struggles against bigger and better-financed foes, county 
environmentalists have emerged more sophisticated politically and seem ready to 
set aside differences to support each others' causes. Computers, databases and 
fax machines have become invaluable weapons, allowing the county's 50 known 
environmental groups to swap mailing lists, the lifeblood of groups short on 
cash and long on need for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, organizers of last November's Laguna Canyon march -- which some 
say helped prod the Irvine Co. to reconsider its 3,200-unit Laguna Laurel 
project -- electronically recruited key environmental figures by fax, who in 
turn attracted thousands of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"Computer technology is allowing us to network like never before," Faber said. 
"We are no longer isolated groups, acting independent of each other. It's much 
different than 10 or 15 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of this environmental awakening is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the Orange County chapter of the Sierra Club has jumped to 9,420. 
"For years people joined as a way to go on outings," said Alan Lopez, the 
club's local membership chairman. "But we've picked up 1,400 new members in 
less than a year, and most sign up because of environmental concerns." 
</P>
<P>
High school and college campuses countywide are hotbeds of environmental 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Fullerton, a small band of students last year formed the 
Rainforest Action Club to discuss the destruction of tropical rain forests, 
valued as major oxygen producers. The group now meets weekly and has a mailing 
list of more than 200, including a dozen professors. Members even sent a small 
donation recently to the Costa Rican National Park Service for rain forest 
replenishment. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach, overflow turnouts are common when Corona del Mar High 
School's six-month-old environmental club meets. 
</P>
<P>
"I was astounded. I didn't think it would fly," said Maya Decker, a biology 
instructor at the school and a longtime Audubon activist. "The goal is to 
change lifestyle patterns. But at first when I talked about water conservation 
and the importance of four-minute showers, some of the kids looked at me like I 
had come from another planet. A four-minute shower is an alien concept to most 
people. But now I think we're getting through." 
</P>
<P>
Troubled by Orange County's consumptive prowess and astounded that with all the 
county's resources, wealth and brain power there was no game plan to slow the 
trend and heal the deteriorating environment, businessman Tom Larson called 
activists together last year for a chat. What resulted was the "Guide for 
Environmental Restoration in Orange County," a collaborative effort by a wide 
range of parties to set an agenda of environmental issues and goals. 
</P>
<P>
"People realize that future generations can't enjoy the rate of consumption and 
growth that has distinguished this county," said Larson, an executive with a 
wholesale Irvine nursery. "We are not seeking to derail progress, or halt 
growth, but send a message that a strong economy must be built on a strong 
environmental base." 
</P>
<P>
On a personal level the message appears to be hitting home. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times poll found that 77% of county residents have become more 
interested in the environment within recent years. Moreover, a vast majority 
support new government regulations, such as mandatory recycling, to cut waste 
and protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Six Orange County cities offer some form of curbside collection for recyclable 
items, including glass bottles and jars, aluminum and tin cans, plastic soda 
and milk containers, newspapers and even cardboard. Half a dozen other cities 
are considering similar programs. Currently, an estimated 175,000 to 200,000 
county residents voluntarily participate in curbside recycling in Anaheim, 
Brea, Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach, Orange and Irvine, which was the first city in 
the county to adopt a program in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started the program we were hoping for 40% participation," Irvine 
Mayor Larry Agran said. "But it's over 70%, and that tells me people are 
looking for ways to get connected to the environmental movement." 
</P>
<P>
But in general, environmentalists say county officials and political leaders 
have been unresponsive and ineffectual in curbing growth and development, which 
is blamed most often for many of the area's ills. They complain that government 
planners are too busy promoting growth-oriented projects rather than seeking 
solutions to overcrowded roads and dwindling open space. 
</P>
<P>
"How come our leadership is trying to get trains from Las Vegas to Anaheim but 
hasn't uttered word one about a countywide recycling program or appointed an 
environmental coordinator," said Sherry Meddick, a longtime backcountry 
activist and founder of the Rural Canyon Residents Assn., who now works for 
Greenpeace. "We don't have environmental leaders. We have environmental 
followers." 
</P>
<P>
Don R. Roth, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, defended the 
proposed high-speed rail link with Las Vegas, saying it will also carry weekday 
commuters to the county from the boom towns of San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties, easing traffic on area freeways. As proposed, the train will be 
privately financed, a direction Roth said government must take to solve transit 
and other environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Government just doesn't have the resources to solve all the problems," Roth 
said. "The initiative and money increasingly must come from the private sector. 
And we've got to act now." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists share Roth's urgency because the impact of the county's 
explosive growth -- and its effects on the environment -- are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County generates more trash per capita -- 2.1 tons for every man, woman 
and child -- than any county in the nation. The region's chronic air pollution 
-- identified in a recent Times Poll among county residents as the No. 1 
environmental threat -- is the worst in the nation. And the county's high-speed 
growth will taper only slightly in the coming decade with 300,000 new arrivals 
pushing the population to more than 2.6 million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad, but this county is becoming strictly an urban area," Cal 
State Fullerton biology professor Jack Burk said. Noise, congestion and 
pollution, he said, have driven many people indoors. "In the 1970s, people 
wanted housing with big yards. But now they don't want any outside space. . . . 
They want to isolate themselves in environmentally controlled homes where it is 
always 72 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their VCRs, computers and Nintendo games. We used to play croquet, 
badminton and tennis outside. Now we go to ritzy clubs and play indoors. It 
seems people are retreating from the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Others, like art photographer Carol Havens, have even left Orange County, 
trading away established careers to live in quieter and less spoiled 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
A native Southern Californian, Havens had lived in Laguna Beach for two 
decades, but a year ago she and her husband moved to a small island north of 
Seattle, Wash. It became "harder and harder" to remain in Orange County, she 
said. The bulldozers and giant earthmovers reshaped the hills she "loved 
photographing." Then came the houses, "row after row. And even if you couldn't 
see them, you could feel them. You knew they were there from traffic, the 
congestion." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we'd go for a drive around South County or toward the mountains, 
I'd end up in tears," she said. "It's expensive to live Orange County. But it 
had always been worth the price -- the weather, the people, the work. But the 
environment got to the point where it wasn't worth the price any more." 
</P>
<P>
Even some developers -- long perceived as the villains in the county's 
environmental equation -- are coming around to the notion of "environmental 
balance." Peter Denniston, president of Signal Landmark Corp., which waged a 
15-year battle to build homes, a marina and restaurants at the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, said that if developers "are not willing to find a balance, show some 
sensitivity to the environment, they shouldn't be in the business." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Signal Landmark and Amigos de Bolsa Chica reached an agreement that 
allows construction of homes on 412 acres in the wetlands but eliminates plans 
for a 1,400-slip marina, hotels and eateries. About 1,104 acres will be left as 
open space or wetlands, where scores of migratory waterfowl nest and feed, 
including a pair of endangered bird species. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmentalists used to be considered extremists, fringe types who were a 
threat to property and political values," Denniston said. "No more. Being 
environmental is now middle America."

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION: FIVE PROFILES 
</P>
<P>
Five who are having an impact in the Orange County environmental movement: 
</P>
<P>
Gary C. Gorman, 44, of Huntington Beach spearheaded a campaign to restore a 
dying 25-acre salt marsh near the mouth of the Santa Ana River, making it 
habitable once again for scores of migratory birds, including several 
endangered species. This week, nearly five years after helping launch the 
effort to revive the Talbert Marsh, Gorman will be honored by the U.S. 
Environmental Agency in Washington for his work to save coastal wetlands, which 
have all but vanished in California. Gorman, a Long Beach firefighter, admits 
that he did not know what wetlands were before he helped bring local, county 
and state officials together to restore the Talbert Marsh along Pacific Coast 
Highway east of Brookhurst Street. Now he is regarded as an expert. "He has 
been a tireless worker, an example of somebody who decided to make a 
difference," said Louann W. Murray, a UCLA professor. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kust, 57, of Irvine is president of the 2,500-member Sea and Sage 
Audubon Society. He helped negotiate an unprecedented agreement last fall with 
the Irvine Co. requiring a series of mitigation measures and changes to protect 
wildlife and reduce the density of the company's 12,500-unit planned community 
in the hills east of Orange. "Some viewed the agreement as a sellout. . . . We 
viewed it as an opportunity to shape a project that was going to be built one 
way or another," said Kust, a part-time business and computer instructor at Cal 
State Fullerton. A 20-year county resident, Kust was involved in Friends of 
Newport Bay before joining the Audubon group nine years ago. He is one reason 
the group is more politically active today, speaking out on a range of 
environmental issues. An active member of the newly formed Orange County Fund 
for Environmental Defense, Kust is a major proponent of creating a Santa Ana 
River park, a series of greenbelts and recreation areas along the river. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Larson, 43, of Irvine was the catalyst behind a 26-page document that is 
now considered Orange County's first environmental manifesto: A Guide for 
Environmental Restoration in Orange County. It was Larson who carried the idea 
a year ago to the county's diverse environmental groups in hopes of unifying a 
fragmented movement. "He is part of the new wave of environmentalists," said 
Elisabeth Brown, a veteran activist who heads the Laguna Greenbelt. "He got a 
bunch of us into a room, and even more amazing we agreed on something. I didn't 
think he could pull it off. He is very sincere." Larson, a horticulturist who 
is executive vice president of a wholesale nursery, said the scientific 
evidence about the environment's deterioration became "so obvious" that it was 
time to act. He is not aligned with any specific group, but supports the newly 
organized Orange County Environmental Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry L. Meddick, 36, of Silverado Canyon has been a backcountry activist for 
more than a decade, challenging efforts for developments in the hills and 
canyons of eastern and southern Orange County. In the backcountry where 
residents are fiercely private and opposed to organized movements, she has 
successfully united diverse interests under the Rural Canyon Residents Assn. 
She is aggressive, unwavering and highly outspoken. "At times she's viewed as 
part of the environmental movement's shock troops," said Audubon official 
Richard Kust. But she is also knowledgeable about complicated land-use issues 
and laws, a point even her opponents concede. At hearings, it's not uncommon 
for an appointed official to publicly seek her opinion. "No matter her style, 
she gets results because she is impeccably prepared," said one county planner 
who has opposed Meddick on several projects. To work on regional issues, 
Meddick recently took a position as field director for the Los Angeles office 
of Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
Jean H. Watt, 63, of Newport Beach has successfully moved from the ranks of 
environmental activist to elected official without losing touch with her 
activist roots. In 1988, she won a seat on the Newport Beach City Council after 
helping guide the group SPON (Stop Polluting Our Newport) for more than a 
decade. The group twice in the 1980s thwarted the Irvine Co.'s expansion plans 
for Newport Center, a major office and retail complex that includes Fashion 
Island. She also played a significant role in the eventual compromise with 
company officials over development of the Irvine Coast (now known as Newport 
Coast) south of Corona del Mar. Since her election she tried to win support for 
a city ordinance restricting the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, 
and is pushing to win adoption of curbside recycling in the beach town. She is 
also vice president of the Orange County Fund for Environmental Defense.

LONGEST MEASLES OUTBREAK STRIKES YOUNG CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
EPIDEMIC: AN INFANT'S DEATH FROM THE DISEASE HAS LEFT HIS MOTHER WARNING OTHERS 
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VACCINATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bobbie Owens lived the nightmare of California's worst measles epidemic in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Pomona mother was about to have her 11-month-old son 
vaccinated -- about the earliest recommended age for measles vaccination -- 
when he caught the highly contagious virus. 
</P>
<P>
"That still runs through my head, over and over: If he could have just hung on 
for a few days for that shot," Owens, a 37-year-old single mother, said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
For seven days she tried in vain to break his fever, bathing him in a small tub 
of cold water. Almost as soon as the measles began dotting his stomach, they 
turned black from the heat of his tiny body. 
</P>
<P>
Once hospitalized at Childrens Hospital of Orange County, Nathan Timothy -- 
named after Owens' brother who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- was 
heavily sedated, and clung to life for a month. 
</P>
<P>
"He never opened his eyes again after we got him there," said Owens, whose baby 
died at the hospital on July 10, 1989. "It got to a point where all I hoped for 
was for him to open his eyes just one more time, so we could look at each other 
one more time." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not easy for me to talk about even now," she added. "I'd just like to 
say how important these vaccinations are. I wouldn't want any mother to go 
through what I've been through. Nobody ever thinks they will lose their baby to 
the measles. My two oldest kids had them and (the measles) were gone in a few 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The Owens family's story underscores how devastating and arbitrary the measles 
epidemic has been for the handful of Southern Californians who have lost loved 
ones to a virus that for years seemed a little threat. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have been suffering from measles since 1987, in what state health 
officials say is the longest running outbreak in the country. Nationwide, 
public health officials say the epidemic is the worst since an immunization 
shot was developed in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Measles outbreaks have been reported in at least 23 states this year, and the 
number of reported cases is running 70% ahead of last year's record pace, 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1963, most American children caught the measles. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of measles victims recover without specific treatment beyond 
fever-reducing medicines and liquids. But in some cases, complications develop, 
including vomiting, dehydration, pneumonia and encephalitis, and sometimes 
patients die. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that are unexplained, there have been a higher percentage of 
serious complications and deaths in the current California epidemic than in 
previous epidemics in the state. California's measles outbreak has been 
compared by one national health official to that of a Third World nation. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County this year, measles has struck 141 people, killing two -- a 
7-month-old Santa Ana boy and an 10-month-old Anaheim girl. Both children were 
too young to be immunized, say health officials, who recommend vaccinations at 
12 months. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, health department officials say that measles have struck 
1,500 people this year, killing six. The dead are a 43-year-old, a 29-year-old, 
a 16-year-old, a 10-year-old cancer patient, and two children less than 3 years 
old. Statewide, the measles have afflicted 1,800 people, killing 24. 
</P>
<P>
Poor, inner-city children of preschool age -- primarily Latinos -- have been 
hit hardest by the epidemic. Lack of government funding has crippled efforts by 
public health officials to curb the outbreak, also known as red measles or 
rubeola. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys indicate that as many as 30% of California's children -- and 50% of 
minority children -- have not been vaccinated by age 2. Pediatricians generally 
advise inoculating babies at 12 to 15 months and again when they reach 
kindergarten age. 
</P>
<P>
So Bobbie Owens was ahead of schedule when she made a mid-June appointment last 
year for Nathan's measles shot. Separated from her children's father, she was 
living on state aid and having her medical bills paid by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just started learning to walk, saying a few words, like 'Mama,' and 
'Dada' and 'Digga Digga.' All those baby goo-goo noises," Owens said during an 
interview at her Pomona apartment. She did not know that measles vaccinations 
do not always take in children less than a year old. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Owens had already lost one son -- to Los Angeles gangs. When her 
eldest son, Terrell, was 13 and began saluting his junior high pals with gang 
signs, Owens feared that the peer pressure to join would be too great for a 
teen-age boy with no big brother or father at home. So she sent him to live 
with his grandparents in Louisiana. He would never see his only brother. 
</P>
<P>
These and other thoughts filled her head as she sat beside Nathan's hospital 
crib each day, 15 or 20 hours sometimes, talking and cooing to her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept telling me there was nothing I could've done. But still, you 
wonder," Owens said. Her 10-year-old daughter, Lacreshia, a second mother to 
Nathan, has been devastated, too. She sometimes wanders out of the room when 
Nathan's name comes up. She will only occasionally mention missing her brother. 
</P>
<P>
Owens and her family have handled the ordeal by going to church frequently. 
There are plenty of pictures of Nathan around their apartment, among the other 
family photographs and an illustration of the Last Supper. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have got through this without praying," Owens said. "I have to 
think that for some reason this was meant to be."

RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS ALL USED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A pilot program providing rental assistance to mobile home owners has reached 
capacity just 10 weeks after kick-off, said Priscilla Headrick, coordinator of 
the program for the Orange Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000 program, which began Feb. 19, offered a maximum grant of $100 per 
month to low-income residents living in one of the city's 10 mobile parks. 
</P>
<P>
Headrick said she had already received 45 applications that would completely 
expend the allocation for this year. To be eligible, applicants must earn less 
than half of the city median income and spend more than 50% of their income for 
housing. Most applicants were senior citizens who were awarded the maximum 
monthly grant, Headrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The County Housing Authority has a similar program subsidizing rent to mobile 
home park owners, but that program has a two- to three-year waiting list, 
Headrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency program will be re-evaluated in September. MARY HELEN

RESTAURANT'S OWNER KILLS ALLEGED ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were in custody Sunday on suspicion of robbing a Vietnamese restaurant 
where a third alleged robber was shot to death by the owner during the 
altercation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Chuc Van Nguyen, 25, and Tam Cong Huynh, 21, have been booked into County Jail, 
while Cuong Chi Nguyen, the 53-year-old owner of the eatery, was released after 
questioning without being charged, Police Lt. Andrew E. Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that Cuong Chi Nguyen shot 24-year-old Hoang Van Le 
about 11:30 p.m. Saturday in self-defense after the three men entered Mai-Hong 
Restaurant intending to rob it, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the three men were arguing with the owner of the restaurant when 
he pulled out a handgun and shot Le several times in the chest. Officers 
arrived before the suspects could flee, and paramedics pronounced the Garden 
Grove resident dead at the scene, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said Le and his friends were armed but did not use guns to threaten 
Nguyen. He did not know what type of weapons they were carrying. 
</P>
<P>
Cuong Chi Nguyen, who lives in Fountain Valley with his family of nine, was not 
at the restaurant Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very upset," his daughter, Diep My Nguyen, 26, said. She also said she 
had worked at the restaurant Saturday night but went home early and was told 
about the shooting by a friend who had heard about it. THUAN LE

GOLDEN WEST OFFERS'COLLEGE BOOT CAMP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers and students at Golden West College call it "college boot camp." 
</P>
<P>
In a one-semester course called College 100, students learn the skills needed 
to survive college life: how to take tests, answer essay questions, write 
research papers, give speeches, enhance creativity and apply for scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Students also learn to build self-esteem, time management, listening skills, 
communication strategies, and how to deal with cultural, racial and gender 
biases. 
</P>
<P>
Since instructors Lou Ann Hobbs and Dean Mancina developed the course in the 
fall of 1988, it has grown into one of the most popular offerings on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Students say the course is among the most useful and practical offered. Some 
students even say that the class has improved their grades. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of ways, it's like going back to elementary school," said Nellie 
Weber, who is back in college after a 14-year hiatus. "I'm learning things that 
were never covered in elementary school but should have been." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the class, Weber said she has dramatically changed her study habits 
and retains more of what she has read. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Honig, a 1987 Ocean View High School graduate, said he stumbled badly 
through his first two years in college. "But now I'm getting A's." 
</P>
<P>
By learning techniques to discipline himself, he said that he is better able to 
deal with stress and avoid being overwhelmed by the demands of school and work. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy this class a lot, more than any class I've had," Honig said. "I think 
this should be given to all college freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
Mancina said that he and Hobbs devised the course by trying to condense into 
one class the study techniques each had learned while attending college. Hobbs 
recalled that she was in her 30s before she finally discovered some of the 
study habits she now teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Why didn't somebody tell me these things before?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The instructors say they try to make the class as useful as possible by 
employing offbeat teaching techniques. Students solve puzzles to challenge 
their creative abilities and play a game simulating two fictional cultures to 
learn to identify and conquer cultural biases. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage students to eliminate bad habits, Mancina tells them to write the 
habit on a piece of paper and tie it to a balloon. The class then releases the 
balloons in a group-therapy ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real reward is to see the self-esteem on their faces," Mancina said. 
"It's what we fantasize that teaching is all about." JOHN PENNER

BODY DISCOVERED IN CHURCH PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities on Sunday were investigating the death of a Buena Park woman whose 
body was found in the parking lot of the Melodyland Christian Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Annette Hays, 40, had suffered a "blunt force trauma" to the head and 
was found about 9:36 p.m. Saturday lying fully clothed in the southeast part of 
the Melodyland parking lot on 400 W. Freedman Way, said Police Lt. John Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the scene by a passer-by who reported seeing the woman's 
body, police officials said. Police found the woman lying dead with a deep 
wound to her head. Cross said an autopsy is being conducted to ascertain exact 
cause of death. He said that no suspects are in custody and that a motive for 
the apparent killing has not been established. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found while the Melodyland church was closed for the night. Church 
officials said they were not made aware of the death until early Sunday and 
added that they believed that it had no relation to the church. One church 
official who asked not to be named said that the parking lot adjoins a vacant 
lot and that it is possible the body was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Ralph Wilkerson announced news of the death to 2,000 congregation 
members attending 10:30 a.m. Easter services. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of gasps and people looking at each other," said Melodyland 
usher Christopher Werrett. JIM CARLTON

CITY PONDERS WAYS TO KEEP CAR DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with losing more of its car dealerships to auto malls in neighboring 
cities, Fullerton officials might offer incentives to keep dealers in town. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are drafting a plan that would create redevelopment areas around 
some of its existing auto dealerships, City Manager William C. Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will be ready for City Council consideration in about two months. 
</P>
<P>
If a redevelopment area were set up, the city would be able to help the 
dealerships expand by buying land around the dealerships and offering it to 
them at a discounted price. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Winter said, car dealerships in Fullerton have no open land 
available on which to expand. If a dealership is to grow, the only affordable 
option is to leave Fullerton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And neighboring Buena Park has a welcome mat out for them -- and for the sales 
tax dollars that they would produce. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Buena Park's redevelopment officials have offered several 
Fullerton auto dealerships discounted land prices in an effort to persuade them 
to move to the city's growing "auto row" off the Santa Ana Freeway and 
Manchester Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
One dealership took Buena Park up on the offer and a second is expected to 
follow, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's car dealerships generate about $1.7 million a year in sales taxes, 
said Ed Paul, the city's revenue manager. 
</P>
<P>
That's about 15% of the total sales tax that Fullerton receives. Only 
department stores bring in more sales tax revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why it's a concern when you lose a car dealership is you can't 
replace a car dealership as easily as a clothing store, a food market or a 
hardware store, where another one can come in quite easily and put another name 
on the door," Paul said. TOM McQUEENEY

TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton in North Orange County are scheduled to 
get their latest aerial application of malathion tonight beginning at 9 in the 
state's ongoing campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second-to-last scheduled treatment for the 26-square-mile spray area, 
which covers parts of both Orange and Los Angeles counties, under a state plan 
to phase out malathion use by early May and replace it with the release of 
millions of sterile Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea area's last treatment is scheduled for April 30. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of recent Medfly finds around the Southland -- including one last 
week in a bountiful agriculture region of Riverside County -- has prompted 
state officials to create new spray zones and broaden the current schedule for 
existing malathion regions. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's second spray region, touching parts of nine cities around 
Garden Grove and Westminster, is scheduled for its next malathion application 
this Thursday and its final treatment on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are advised to stay indoors during the applications and cover fish 
ponds and cars. Those with questions can call the county's Medfly hot line at 
(714) 447-7118.

TRAFFIC CORRIDORS MEET DEMANDS OF MODERN ERA; 
</P>
<P>
JUST AS WARTIME GAS RATIONING REQUIRED ADAPTATION, FREEWAY CONGESTION 
NECESSITATES CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES -- SUCH AS TOLL ROADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WOOLLETT JR., William Woollett Jr. is the executive director of the 
Transportation Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not very many people may remember the old Red Car trolley line. Or gas 
rationing during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But I remember those times. I was raised in the era of gas rationing, when 
people were forced to find alternative means of transportation to respond to 
the circumstances in which they lived. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember when an A stamp got you only three gallons of gas -- so it also 
gave you an incentive to get out of your car or find someone else with whom to 
ride. We changed our work schedules if we had to. We responded to the demands 
of the era. 
</P>
<P>
In similar fashion, Orange County is responding to current traffic congestion 
by designing, financing and building nearly 68 miles of toll roads -- the first 
in the state. These transportation corridors are part of today's response to 
the demands of this era, and they are also part of a system that includes 
surface streets, freeways, buses, fixed rails, cycling and walking. 
</P>
<P>
The corridors will provide tremendous relief to current traffic congestion in 
Orange County. In fact, more than 200,000 cars are initially projected to be on 
the corridors and off congested freeways and roads in 1995, when all three are 
open. Significant traffic improvement will be immediate. 
</P>
<P>
But opening the corridors doesn't mean they will be complete. They are being 
designed to grow with the times and changing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Construction will be "phased" -- meaning that median improvements such as 
reversible lanes and fixed rail will be built as traffic demand warrants. 
Motorists and commuters in 2010 will find that the facilities anticipated and 
answered their needs too. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, questions have arisen regarding the financial vitality of these 
leading-edge projects. Yes, they are challenging from a financing standpoint, 
as is every transportation project in Orange County right now. And the 
corridors are the only roads being built virtually without federal, state or 
local transportation funding. 
</P>
<P>
But that has not rendered these projects infeasible. Quite the contrary. 
Through a unique combination of fees on new development and tax-free, 
toll-revenue municipal bonds, the financing for these three thoroughfares is 
innovative yet practical. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, all costs for design, operation, administration and environmental 
documentation are being funded through development fees levied against 
builders. Our strategy is to delay issuance of bonds as long as possible in 
order to minimize interest costs. When projected cash flows deplete reserve 
development fees, as the corridor agencies anticipate they will, they will 
issue the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The question, then, becomes "How much new highway can be funded?" We are 
confident that traffic demands will be more than met by the initial phase of 
all three projects. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy of "phasing" is prudent. Using that approach, only the road 
capacity needed to meet current traffic loads is constructed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on the Foothill Corridor (which runs roughly parallel to 
Interstate 5, connecting with it at the San Diego-Orange County line), that may 
mean an opening-day configuration of four instead of eight general-purpose 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Or, on opening day, the Eastern Corridor (running in two legs parallel to the 
Riverside and Costa Mesa freeways from Gypsum Canyon Road to the Santa Ana 
Freeway at the Laguna Freeway and Jamboree Road) could be six rather than eight 
lanes, two of which could be High Occupancy Vehicle lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Other options will be chosen considering such factors as air-quality standards 
and traffic forecasting in addition to financing options. 
</P>
<P>
The most advanced and efficient toll- collection technology will be used. The 
new computerized scanning equipment and electronically printed toll tags will 
enable motorists to enter and exit the corridors at freeway on-ramp and 
off-ramp speeds without stopping. The tolls will be used to repay the 
tax-exempt construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, these innovations require thorough, complicated, meticulous 
environmental documentation to answer local concerns as well as meet state and 
federal regulations. Each corridor is currently in the midst of those 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the corridors also conforms to the mandates of the new Air 
Quality Management Plan by increasing ridership and reducing auto emissions in 
the basin. 
</P>
<P>
Since I became executive director of the Transportation Corridor Agencies six 
months ago, I've realized that I came to the agencies with some biases. Years 
ago, like every other kid, when I turned 16, I couldn't wait to get my driver's 
license. But during the war, even though I could legally drive, we simply 
didn't have the gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us became totally independent of driving. We learned to do what was 
necessary to transport ourselves. Today's drivers are doing the same. The toll 
facilities will provide additional options -- and a means to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Another bias I brought to this job was the belief that cooperation between the 
public and private sectors is essential. Having worked in both, I have seen 
that the energy, skills, sensitivities and financial resources of both sectors 
can be maximized when the relationship is not adversarial but cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
We have been fortunate to have the benefit of a unique public/private 
partnership as these corridors have evolved, with the development community 
contributing part of the cost and the elected officials of 17 Orange County 
communities joining together on our boards of directors to help solve a 
regional problem. 
</P>
<P>
I have seen a tremendous dedication to "making it happen." Local, parochial 
interests are being integrated into a commitment to solving the transportation 
problems of the county as a whole. There is significant participation from a 
broad spectrum of groups. 
</P>
<P>
The corridor agencies have a special relationship with Caltrans, enabling our 
two organizations to work closely together on a project of massive proportions. 
We're actively involved with the Southern California Assn. of Governments, the 
Air Quality Management District, the Department of Fish and Game, and dozens of 
other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
I also realize that we have a significant responsibility to succeed. These 
corridors are vital to Orange County's future. But they are also a bellwether 
for the potential success of private toll roads in the state; a bellwether for 
future partnerships between the public and private sectors; and a bellwether 
for increased cooperation between local, state and federal transportation 
agencies.

UC Irvine will name an athletic director today, filling a position that has 
been vacant since September, the school announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Big West Conference Associate Commissioner Dennis Farrell, former Houston 
Athletic Director Tom Ford, Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Dan 
Guerrero and former Detroit Lions Coach Darryl Rogers are the remaining 
candidates from six who were interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
A press conference has been scheduled for 1 p.m. today at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Edwards, associate athletic director at UC San Diego, said Sunday night 
that he had not been contacted by Irvine officials. Tom Beckett, associate 
athletic director at Stanford, interviewed for the job but later withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
The new athletic director will replace John Caine, who held the job for six 
years before being reassigned as a special assistant to the chancellor in 
September. Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs, has been 
acting athletic director since Oct. 1. A 15-member search committee on Monday 
recommended from two to four names to Mitchell and Chancellor Jack W. Peltason.

BESCHEN KEEPS HIS COOL IN THE FINAL HEAT, WINS FIRST MAJOR PRO TITLE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shane Beschen of San Clemente, no longer the nervous amateur in the surfing 
world, won his first major professional title Sunday at the Easter Surfing 
Classic at Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really stoked," said Beschen, who is in his second year on the U.S. tour 
and first as a professional. "I've made five finals in my last eight 
(competitions) since last summer, but I never won one until now. 
</P>
<P>
"I finished second in Malibu last summer, and after that I had no trouble 
getting to the finals. But once I was there I either didn't catch the waves or 
I fell. It all came together this time." 
</P>
<P>
Beschen, 18, a senior at San Clemente High School, was the unanimous winner in 
the four-man heat. Doug Silva of Isla Vista was second, followed by Bryan 
Pottger of Fountain Valley and Sean Mattison of Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it a little more easy this time," Beschen said. "I wasn't amped up as 
much as I was in the other finals. I just treated it as another heat. In the 
other finals, I got so excited that I lost it. But today was my day." 
</P>
<P>
In the bodyboarding competition, Mike Stewart of Anaheim, the three-time U.S. 
champion, won his first title of the year, edging Ben Severson of Honolulu. 
Stewart won $2,000 and took a 90-point lead over Severson in the season point 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Beschen earned $7,000 for his victory and also took first place in the point 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
He received 1,000 points for the victory, pushing his season total to 2,386. 
Jim Hogan of San Clemente and Charlie Kuhn of Indian Harbor, Fla., the 
top-seeded surfer who was eliminated Saturday, are tied for second with 1,904. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to win the (season) title this year and then I'll probably go on 
the world tour," said Beschen, who finished fourth in the standings last 
season. "Last year I would make a final and it would be like, 'Wow, I can do 
it.' But this year it's not just a fantasy. I don't have to dream about making 
finals anymore. It's reality." 
</P>
<P>
Beschen took control of the final early, riding a wave in the first few seconds 
of the 30-minute competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to get a good wave right off the bat," Beschen said. "I get in a good 
rhythm and I don't have to worry about catching a lot of waves at the end. That 
causes a lot of stress." 
</P>
<P>
Dino Andino of San Clemente, seeded fifth, fell in the quarterfinals and Hogan, 
seeded fourth, was eliminated in the semifinals by Pottger and Mattison. The 
top two surfers in each semifinal advanced to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Andino and Hogan finished second and third, respectively, in last year's point 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
But Beschen, the youngest of the San Clemente trio, has become the leader this 
season. He has a crisp style that some people say is similar to that of world 
champion Tom Curren. 
</P>
<P>
"That's definitely a compliment," Beschen said. "Curren's one of the best 
surfers around, but Martin Potter is the one I look up to the most. I don't get 
to see him surf much, except on videos. I try to do maneuvers that are 
radical." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart won the bodyboarding competition with some radical moves. He used a 
series of spins, reverse spins and 360-degree rolls that were effective on the 
one- and two-foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
"(The small waves) are worrisome for me," he said. "I'm one of the bigger guys 
on the tour and it's hard for me to maneuver on the small waves. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into a good rhythm. (The rolls) brought my confidence up early." 
</P>
<P>
The victory also gave him some breathing room in a close season-points battle 
with Severson. Stewart trailed Severson by 10 points going into the finals, but 
now leads by 90. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been close ever since the competition in Hawaii earlier this year," 
Stewart said. "I wanted to win bad. That boosted my desire factor." 
</P>
<P>
Severson said he was frustrated by the lack of waves for the final. He said he 
had to wait several minutes for one to come through. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I looked down the beach I saw Stewart catch a wave and I said to 
myself, 'Where did that come from?' " Severson said.

FRANKIE &amp; ANNETTE: SHTICK, FLIMSY POP

<P>
Friday the 13th was a nicely ironic day for Frankie Avalon and Annette 
Funicello to open their first concert tour together. It brought to mind the 
gulf between teen exploitation then and teen exploitation now. 
</P>
<P>
The innocent romance and endless fun in the warm California sun of their 
disposable beach movies made Frankie &amp; Annette both an item and an icon to 
the popular mind of the early '60s. Wind the teen-flick reel forward a 
generation or so and we've gone from a chaste couple smooching in the sand to a 
homicidal demon in a hockey mask wreaking bloody mayhem on the sexually 
initiated young -- the basic premise of the "Friday the 13th" series. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of Frankie and Annette's reunion tour, which began Friday afternoon 
on an outdoor stage at Knott's Berry Farm, is a nostalgic return to innocence 
with a scrubbed, friendly all-American couple who grew to middle age without 
becoming mired in the unwholesomeness that started setting in when hair started 
growing long. 
</P>
<P>
Funicello, now 47, talked about how she never toured before, despite Frankie's 
urging, because she was too busy taking her three kids to Little League 
baseball games and shuttling them around in car pools. Avalon, 50, tossed out 
stale one-liners about what it's like to be the father of eight children. 
"That's with one wife, you know," he noted in a straightforward tone, adding a 
wholesome dab of background paint to the show's American dream portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie and Annette were a likable duo who seemed genuinely to enjoy each 
other's company and were willing to poke fun at their old selves. But their 50 
minutes of silly, scripted shtick interspersed with some of the flimsiest pop 
hits of all time quickly eliminated any craving for a return to innocence. If 
songs like Funicello's "Tall Paul" and Avalon's "Why" are the stuff of 
wholesome pop, it's a good thing corruption prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon and Funicello both rose to success on a cleansing late-'50s tide that 
partly succeeded in taking dirty ol' rock 'n' roll, the creation of blacks and 
wild Southern boys, and turning it into something safe and sanitized for 
well-bred kids from good suburban families. Of the hits they re-created, only 
Avalon's "Venus" was worth hearing again. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon, tanned and trim, presented the croon and patter of a Las Vegas lounge 
smoothie. It was a workmanlike, generic performance, without any distinguishing 
qualities. Watching Avalon on stage at Knott's, it was easy to imagine any 
other handsome and competent middle-aged lounge singer or wedding-band pro 
standing in his place. Avalon was just lucky enough to have had Dick Clark in 
his corner when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
The show rocked a wee bit on "California Sun," a 1964 hit for the Rivieras, 
with Avalon doing a bit of back-to-back boogie with his guitar-playing son, 
Tony. Another son, Frank, played drums and, with his brother, served as an 
excuse for a get-a-haircut joke that was just one predictable slice from a 
whole moldy loaf of one-liners. Avalon's humor was worse than stale when, after 
singing "Beauty School Drop-out," from the film, "Grease," he tried to make 
some sort of clever connection between grease and Mexicans. There is more 
wholesomeness in a hormonal, expletive-filled heavy-metal show than in that 
sort of ethnic humor. 
</P>
<P>
Funicello sang like a Miss America contestant whose voice is not her strong 
suit. She was able to carry a tune in a thin, tinny voice, but after a while 
she was prone to drop it. The 11-member backing ensemble included three singers 
who were able to cover for Annette when she needed help. 
</P>
<P>
Funicello's solo spot (the concert sandwiched short solo bits between opening 
and closing duo sequences) included a half-sung, half-narrated country-style 
ballad that she wrote about her family's move from New York state to the 
"promised land" of her California girlhood (Funicello said she started out 
intending to write a book instead of a mere song, but publishers weren't 
interested in a tale so lacking in seamy details and glitz). Eventually, she 
said, "an angel appeared in the form of a man known to millions as Walt Disney" 
to take her off the stage of a school play and onto the set of the Mickey Mouse 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
With her perpetual demure smile, Funicello still stands for the perky 
wholesomeness of a Disney girl. But there was something unsettling about seeing 
a middle-aged woman wearing a big pink bow in her hair. There ought to be a 
statute of limitations on some childhood trappings, even for a former 
Mouseketeer.

A 2-year-old boy missing 16 hours after disappearing from an Easter carnival at 
a Sunland park was found this morning wandering in a Panorama City parking lot 
about 10 miles away, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Salazar of Sunland appeared to be unharmed and was in good spirits when 
reunited with his mother and father at Sunland Park about 10:15 a.m. Police 
said the boy will undergo a medical examination to determine if he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
When a police car pulled into the park and the boy was handed over to his 
mother and father, he was immediately surrounded by a crush of relatives and 
media. Several of the relatives were crying as they kissed the boy or called, 
"Hi, Jesse! Hi, Jesse!" 
</P>
<P>
Although they said the boy could not have walked from Sunland to Panorama City, 
police stopped short of calling the boy's disappearance a kidnaping. Police 
said the boy is too young to tell them what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Tim McBride said detectives were investigating a report that Jesse had 
been seen earlier with a group of people at the shopping center where he was 
found in the 8400 block of Van Nuys Boulevard. It was unclear whether the 
group, which police said was a family, had kidnaped the boy or had found him 
wandering alone and took care of him. The family has not been found by police. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what we have," McBride said. "It is hard to tell what he has 
been through. As far as the people he was with . . . they might be involved in 
a kidnap or they might have been Good Samaritans. They could have gotten scared 
that they would be accused of kidnaping and left the boy." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse disappeared about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, shortly after he arrived with his 
mother and father, Patricia and Jesse Salazar Sr., both 19, at the park in the 
8600 block of Foothill Boulevard, police said. The family intended to have a 
picnic and attend the park's Easter carnival. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just on an Easter outing," McBride said. "As the mother and father 
were unloading things from the car, the boy got excited and ran over to the 
carnival. He disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Police were called and an intensive search followed. More than 50 officers, 
family members, several concerned citizens and members of the Citizen Emergency 
Mobile Patrol searched the park and surrounding neighborhoods through the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The search continued until this morning. Police declined to identify the person 
who found the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just very, very happy," said Jesse Salazar Sr., as he waited with other 
family members at the park after hearing that his son had been found.

LONDON ROCK FANS THRONG CONCERT SALUTE TO MANDELA

More than 70,000 rock fans thronged to an anti-apartheid concert televised to a 
potential audience of 1 billion people today as a tribute to black nationalist 
leader Nelson R. Mandela and his campaign to end white minority rule in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and his wife Winny both smiled broadly and raised their right fists in 
a symbol of defiance as they entered London's Wembley Stadium and sat in a 
special section with other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was scheduled to deliver an address at the conclusion of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
The audience crammed the arena to capacity, cheering, waving flags and 
releasing balloons as a succession of musicians performed on a vast stage 
adorned with the colors of the African National Congress and African art 
murals. 
</P>
<P>
The first artist in the program, expected to last some four hours, was singer 
Patti LaBelle. Others on the card were Tracy Chapman, Peter Gabriel, Simple 
Minds, Lou Reed, Neil Young, Chrissie Hynde, Dave Stewart and Miriam Makeba. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone had trouble with the traffic getting here, there was one guy who 
took 27 years to get here," said British comedian Lenny Henry. 
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp. said 26 nations -- a potential audience of 1 
billion people -- will receive live coverage, giving Mandela the largest 
platform to air his views since he was released after 27 years in jail on Feb. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said there will be numerous collaborations and unlikely duets 
between musicians. The event is predicted to be of a similar magnitude as the 
1985 Live Aid concert and a 1988 event staged to mark Mandela's birthday in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is in Britain for the first time in 28 years but has refused to meet 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who eased sanctions against Pretoria because 
it proceeded with reform plans, including releasing him and legalizing the ANC.

S&amp;L TO SELL THREE PALM SPRINGS RESORTS IN $967-MILLION DEAL

In one of the biggest real estate deals this year, Landmark Land Co. Inc., a 
California savings and loan, said today that it agreed to sell most of its vast 
portfolio of real estate and resort developments for $967 million. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark said it would sell the properties to Orange County developer Barry Hon 
in two phases over the next 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
The sale includes nearly all of Landmark's premier golf resorts, including PGA 
West, Mission Hills Country Club and La Quinta Hotel Golf and Tennis Resort in 
the Palm Springs area. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark said the sale was forced by December's savings and loan reform that 
limited equity investments by thrifts and boosted requirements for capital 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry the law changed, but this is what we had to do," said Chairman 
Gerald Barton, who bought Landmark in 1971 when it had less than $5 million in 
assets and built it into a major real estate developer. "I think we got a fair 
value, but I think Mr. Hon got an excellent deal." 
</P>
<P>
Landmark's properties include a 6,404-acre, master-planned community in 
Riverside County, a 100-room hotel, golf course and world-class tennis club at 
Carmel Valley Ranch, and an upscale, 800-home development surrounding a golf 
course at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains in San Bernardino County. In 
addition to the California properties, the sale includes land on Kiawah Island, 
S.C., and in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Israeli soldiers today fired plastic bullets or used tear gas to break up 
protests in at least three towns on the occupied West Bank as Palestinians 
marked the second anniversary of the slaying of PLO leader Abu Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were wounded in the clashes, according to Arab reports, and 
the army said one soldier was slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial parades and protests were reported in a half dozen towns and refugee 
camps in the occupied West Bank on the anniversary of the 1988 slaying of 
Khalil Wazir, the Palestine Liberation Organization's military commander. 
Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, Arabic for "father of war," was killed in a 
commando raid in Tunis. The death was blamed on Israel, but the government has 
never acknowledged responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Jihad's death prompted mass rioting throughout the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. Fourteen Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in the 
bloodiest day of violence during the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
To head off violence today, the army imposed a curfew and ordered the 700,000 
Palestinian residents of the occupied Gaza Strip confined to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
In one clash in the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers opened fire with plastic 
bullets, wounding two Palestinians, Arab reports said. A 23-year-old 
Palestinian also was reported shot in clashes with soldiers in the West Bank 
village of Beita. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Nablus, an Israeli soldier was slightly injured in the right leg when a 
concrete block was dropped from a rooftop as he patrolled the crowded central 
market, the army spokesman's office and Arab reports said.

BLAST, FIRE ON INDIA TRAIN KILLS 80 PEOPLE, INJURES 65

<P>
A leaking gas cylinder exploded and burned in a passenger train in eastern 
India today, killing at least 80 people and injuring 65 others, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Local reporters said at least 100 people died in the fire, which raged through 
two train cars before firefighters extinguished it. 
</P>
<P>
The train was passing through Patna, 500 miles southeast of New Delhi, when the 
fire broke out at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze swept through two cars of the 16-car train before firefighters could 
extinguish it, said District Magistrate S. K. Sharma, top civil administrator 
in the Patna region. 
</P>
<P>
United News of India quoting local officials said at least 80 people died. 
</P>
<P>
"After smelling something like gas, I felt suffocated and jumped out of the 
train," said Ram Narain Prasad, who sustained a head injury in his leap from 
the second car. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing cards. Suddenly a strong smell of gas engulfed the whole 
compartment and in a trice, a column of thick smoke and leaping flames 
enveloped the ill-fated bogey (car)," Suresh Singh, a railway employee, told 
the Press Trust of India news agency. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that, based on survivors' reports, investigators believe the 
inferno was sparked by the explosion of a natural gas cylinder used for welding 
torches that was brought aboard one of the cars. The shattered, blackened 
cylinder was recovered from the charred remains of one of the cars. 
</P>
<P>
The nozzle of the cylinder, apparently came off, releasing the pressurized 
contents in a tremendous gush, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators speculated that the leaking gas was then ignited by a cigarette 
and the cylinder exploded in an intense fireball. Flames were spread rapidly 
back to the second coach by wind created by the forward movement of the train, 
they said.

Growing numbers of voters think Sen. Alan Cranston should resign over his 
involvement in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, a poll said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old Democrat continues to lose backing from the public, despite an 
aggressive campaign to blame the press and former chief thrift regulator Edwin 
Gray for his problems, California Poll Director Mervin Field said. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll taken between March 26 and April 6, 47% of the respondents said 
Cranston should resign before his term ends in 1992; 32% said he should not 
resign, and 21% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, 62% said Cranston should finish his term, while 25% believed 
that he should quit. 
</P>
<P>
The latest California Poll also said Cranston would only get support for 
reelection from 15% of the voters as opposed to 66% against giving him another 
term in office. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's popularity has plummeted since disclosures about his involvement in 
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal began last year.

Poland's best-known husband is secretive and tough to get along with, says the 
mother of Lech Walesa's eight children, who adds: "I don't think any other 
woman could put up with him." 
</P>
<P>
Danuta Walesa, wife of the Solidarity union leader for more than 20 years, 
bared her family secrets in a television interview today. 
</P>
<P>
"Lech is not an easy man to love, understand and be with. I don't think any 
other woman could put up with him," she told a talk-show host on state 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always so secretive. You talk to him, and you never know if you're 
getting through or what he's thinking about," she said of the man widely 
expected to become Poland's next president. 
</P>
<P>
But Danuta Walesa added: "He usually comes around on family matters. . . . What 
goes on in the family is 98% dependent on a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, met his wife in 1969 at a flower 
shop where she was working. They were married a short while later and have 
children ranging from preschool age to young adults. 
</P>
<P>
She told viewers that she enjoys political drama and danger. "When martial law 
was declared (in 1981 to stamp out the Solidarity), it didn't really faze me. 
My husband was interned, but I knew they wouldn't harm him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what was most important in life, Danuta Walesa said: "To raise our 
children to become decent human beings and good Poles, people who have respect 
for others. There's too little of that nowadays."

King Birendra today bowed to a groundswell for further democratic reform and 
asked a veteran opposition leader to be prime minister of an interim 
government, the opposition party announced. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Birendra announced the resignation of Prime Minister Lokendra 
Bahadur Chand and the dissolution of the no-party legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The developments ended a week of political deadlock that ensued after the king 
yielded on April 8 to demands that a 29-year-old ban on political parties be 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the prime minister-designate and acting president of 
the long-banned Nepali Congress Party, said he will present a Cabinet on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai also said King Birendra indicated during a meeting today with 
opposition leaders that he will look favorably upon the idea of becoming a 
constitutional monarch, foresaking the near-absolute power he has wielded for 
his 18 years on the throne. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, a youth gang set fire to a movie theater ticket office and stoned 
another empty cinema, prompting the capital's four other theaters to close. It 
is not known why the gang targeted the movie theaters, located 500 yards from 
the royal palace.

<P>
Revenues were $2.6 billion in the first quarters of both 1990 and 1989, Alcoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Paul O'Neill attributed the earnings decline in part to operations of 
the company's Brazilian affiliate, Alcoa Aluminio, which broke even for the 
1990 first quarter but was subject to "rampant inflation in that country."

The Orient Express service, started in the late 19th Century, was discontinued 
after World War II, financially unable to withstand the competition from 
airlines and faster and cheaper trains. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwood Travel said 100 presumably wealthy travelers will be able to board the 
Orient Express' original Pullman cars at London's Victoria Station on May 30 
for an Istanbul-bound journey of four days and five nights. 
</P>
<P>
The Pullman cars were discarded after the service was discontinued. The cars 
were saved from destruction and restored by two investors and are now used for 
leisure trips on the Nostalgie Istanbul Orient-Express and the Venice Simplon 
Orient-Express lines. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwood Travel did not disclose the price of the trip.

<P>
The Saudi oil minister today announced new efforts to bring back into line OPEC 
partners violating the cartel's oil production quotas and driving down prices, 
an official report said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first official Saudi reaction to last week's wild swings in oil 
prices as a result of overproduction by some OPEC members. 
</P>
<P>
The current situation not only harms "all producers, but . . . weakens the 
chances of the anticipated improvement in oil prices during the second half of 
the current year," Oil Minister Hisam Nazer was quoted as saying today by the 
Saudi Press Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The press agency said Nazer will meet Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Ali al 
Khalifa al Sabah, and his United Arab Emirates counterpart, Mana Said Oteiba, 
in the Red Sea port city of Jidda on Tuesday. He said consultations with other 
OPEC states were aimed at restoring "their production to the allocated 
ceiling," the agency reported.

'SHAME' STILL HARVESTED 30 YEARS LATER; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SEQUEL TO EDWARD R. MURROW'S DOCUMENTARY FINDS THAT MIGRANT FARM 
WORKERS' CONDITIONS REMAIN DEPLORABLE.

<P>
A sequel to Edward R. Murrow's famous "Harvest of Shame" documentary showing 
the deplorable conditions of migrant farm workers in 1960 found little has 
changed in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago, CBS cameras panned over a long line of tired, hungry farm 
workers waiting for bags of food. They had just lost their jobs to a killing 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Public Broadcasting Service shot the same scene, this time outside the National 
Guard Armory in Homestead, Fla., after deadly Christmas freeze that dropped 
temperatures to 22 degrees in the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
The only notable difference is that one scene was filmed in black and white and 
the other taped in color. 
</P>
<P>
Murrow's report shocked the nation by showing that many Americans ate because 
of people who earned miserable wages and had no sick pay, vacations and 
unemployment benefits or disability pay. On top of that, the migrant workers 
for the most part lived in squalid housing. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, PBS will air "New Harvest, Old Shame," the story of Pedro 
Silva's family on the roads and in the fields of rural America as it moves from 
an Indiana bunkhouse to a trailer at the Everglades Labor Camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Even nature is against them," said the producer, Hector Galan. "This year they 
faced heavy rains in Indiana that cut crop yields in half, Hurricane Hugo in 
South Carolina which left them with no work, and the freeze in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Galan located Pedro Silva and his wife Reina in late November and followed him 
with an assistant and a photographer as the extended family's six-vehicle 
convoy headed south, stopping at highway rest areas to eat, wash and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Reina Silva's sister, Maria Martinez, said she wanted to be filmed to give 
farmers a hard look at the way their workers live. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the farm workers in this country stopped working, the farmers would 
have to let their fruits and vegetables rot in the fields," she said. "They 
have to realize that when we make money, they make money. When we eat, they 
eat."

HEART ATTACK KILLED ROBIN HARRIS

<P>
The Cook County Medical Examiner's office has rule that a heart attack killed 
comedian-actor Robin Harris, who was found dead in his hotel room after a 
performance last month. Autopsy results were inconclusive and officials waited 
for the results of toxicology tests before announcing the official cause of 
death as natural, said Bill Juneau of the medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his age, investigators speculated that Harris, 36, a Chicago native 
who spent most of his years in Los Angeles, suffered from a previously 
undetected congenital heart disease, Juneau said. 
</P>
<P>
The actor suffered the heart attack March 18 at the posh, downtown Four Seasons 
Hotel after an evening performance at the New Regal Theater. 
</P>
<P>
He had appeared in the movies "Do the Right Thing," "Harlem Nights," and most 
recently, "House Party."

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Polly Bergen, perhaps best known to television audiences for her 
Emmy-nominated role as Rhoda in "War and Remembrance" and the sequel "The Winds 
of War," has filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen filed a Superior Court petition in Los Angeles today to end her 
eight-year marriage to New York entrepreneur Jeffrey Endervelt. 
</P>
<P>
The court documents cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the 
split. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen, 60, and Endervelt, 50, maintained homes on both coasts and had no 
children, said Marilyn Reiss, publicist for Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
The actress was nominated for two Emmy Awards, one for "The Winds of War" and 
the other for "War and Remembrance." Rhoda was the wife of naval officer Pug 
Henry in the miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen is in Louisiana today, working on the CBS-TV pilot "Steel Magnolias," 
based on the movie, Reiss said.

Sweden's Bjorn Waldegaard romped home to his fourth victory in the grueling 
Safari Rally today after leading the diminished pack of cars for most of the 
five-day 2,480-mile race through rain-drenched mountains, plains and bushland.

<P>
Waldegaard, 48, his face creased with a winning smile and his Toyota Celica GT4 
lathered with mud, revved onto the ramp in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi to end 
the 38th East Africa rally. 
</P>
<P>
He lost 8 hours, 39 minutes, 11 seconds during the ordeal to claim his fourth 
victory in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Finland's Juha Kankkunen, driving a Lancia Delta Integrale, finished second 
about 40 minutes later, having shed 8:41:23. Mikael Ericsson, also in a Toyota

San Diego State assistant basketball coach Maury Hanks resigned today to accept 
a similar position at Drake University. Hanks, an Aztecs assistant since 1987, 
said the opportunity to work with Drake's new head coach, Rudy Washington, is 
too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get to work with your best friend every day," Hanks said of 
Washington, whom he met 10 years ago when Washington was an assistant coach at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real hard decision leaving . . . a respected head coach like (San 
Diego State's) Jim Brandenburg and a program that next year should have some 
success with the players they have returning. But I think it will be a great 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Hanks, 27, was an assistant at Clemson for two years before he came to San 
Diego State in 1987. Brandenburg said he will start looking for a new assistant 
after he has finished recruiting.

The Milwaukee Brewers recorded the largest shutout in the club's history today, 
pounding out 20 hits and beating the Boston Red Sox 18-0 before a Patriots Day 
crowd of 35,478 in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker and Greg Brock had four hits each, and Gary Sheffield, Edgar Diaz 
and Brock drove in three runs apiece. Milwaukee had nine doubles and one triple 
but no home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Higuera (1-0) allowed two hits in 6 1/3 innings as he won in Fenway Park 
for the first time after five losses. Tom Filer and Dan Plesac finished the 
combined three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker (1-1) gave up six runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings, and Dennis 
Lamp followed by allowing three runs and four hits in 1 1/3 innings. Rookie 
Dana Kiecker allowed four runs in 1 1/3 innings, and Mike Rochford gave up four 
runs in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Every Milwaukee starter except Dale Sveum got a hit. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 runs by the Brewers were one short of the team record, set against 
Boston on May 31, 1980. The 18-0 loss was one run short of the biggest shutout 
defeat for the Red Sox; Cleveland beat Boston 19-0 on May 18, 1955. 
</P>
<P>
The major league record for the largest shutout was the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
22-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 16, 1975. The American League 
record of 21-0 was set by the Detroit Tigers against Cleveland Indians on Sept. 
15, 1901, and tied by the New York Yankees against the Philadelphia Athletics 
on Aug. 13, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who has hit safely in all five Milwaukee games, had three doubles and a 
single. Brock doubled twice and singled twice. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, bothered by injuries last year, allowed only a single by Ellis Burks 
leading off the fifth inning and a single by Tony Pena. He struck out three and 
walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Vaughn had two doubles and a single and two RBIs, while Diaz drove in 
three runs with three singles. 
</P>
<P>
The nine doubles by Milwaukee were two short of the American League record set 
by Detroit against the Yankees on July 14, 1934. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots Day game started at the traditional time of 11:05 a.m. to allow 
fans to watch the latter stages of the Boston Marathon.

GIANTS' BEDROSIAN CAN'T CLOSE DOOR ON SON'S ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By SUSAN FORNOFF, MC CLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time the Giants saw their acclaimed closer, Steve Bedrosian was 
tearing the door off the valuables cabinet in their Atlanta clubhouse to get 
his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
He had just learned that his and Tammy Bedrosian's 2-year-old son, Cody, had 
become ill again. Thursday, the Bedrosians learned that Cody has acute 
lymphocytic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday the startled Giants saw a thinner, wearier and sadder Steve 
Bedrosian suddenly appear at their clubhouse door. 
</P>
<P>
Cody was feeling better this Easter Sunday, and Dad decided to follow the 
doctors' orders to get on with his life. But even a pressure-packed 
ninth-inning pitching situation couldn't capture Bedrosian's undivided 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to block it out. It really is," he said. "I dream about him at 
night. And I wake up in the morning thinking about him. Some things you just 
can't block out." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if Bedrosian could have blocked out Cody, that ninth-inning fastball to 
Benito Santiago would have been inside, where it belonged, where Santiago might 
have swung and missed. Instead, it was over the plate, and Santiago swung and 
connected for a game-winning homer that spoiled Giants manager Roger Craig's 
perfect plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great situation for us to bring in Bedrosian and let him take out his 
frustrations on somebody else," Craig said. "But it didn't work out that way. 
The situation worked out. The score (4-3) didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian, who hadn't worked on the mound since the April 6 Bay Bridge Series 
game against the Oakland A's, came to work offering to pitch immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be throwing on adrenaline," he said in a short pregame press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke alternately of his family's suffering and its optimism, about how 
terrible it is for his child's condition to be diagnosed as leukemia, yet how 
fortunate it is that this particular form of leukemia is common and sometimes 
curable. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts, but our immediate thoughts were, 'He's got it. Let's beat it,' " 
Bedrosian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bedrosians spent every waking minute at the UC San Francisco hospital to be 
with Cody, who, Bedrosian said, understands that he is ill but doesn't 
understand the gravity of the illness. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday was an especially bad day for Cody, but by Sunday the medication 
kicked in enough to ease his pain. That's when his father decided to surprise 
teammates and report to the ballpark for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian got up and started throwing in the bullpen for pitching coach Norm 
Sherry during the fifth inning. He realized quickly that he needed more work. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a robot, to tell you the truth," he said. "I was flying out, and I 
was way ahead of myself. So I threw some more and played catch with the 
outfielders between innings and did everything I could to get some work in." 
</P>
<P>
The save opportunity was there in the ninth inning. Craig couldn't pass up this 
chance to cheer up Bedrosian, and neither could Bedrosian. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gave Bedrosian a standing ovation when he walked to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian gave up a double to Joe Carter on his second pitch, got Garry 
Templeton to ground out on his fourth pitch and then, three pitches later, lost 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could have gotten the pitch inside," he said. "It's been a little 
tough concentrating lately." 
</P>
<P>
He's not sure yet whether he will join his teammates for their game tonight at 
Dodger Stadium. Much depends on Cody's condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the game, and I love my job," Bedrosian said. "But it's kind of on the 
bottom of my priorities right now."

Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka has agreed to donate $10,000 a year to the 
University of Pittsburgh for the next 10 years to establish a $100,000 endowed 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The Mike Ditka Endowed Scholarship Fund will provide financial assistance to 
students who have distinguished themselves in athletics and academics, 
according to Robert Heddleston, the university's assistant athletic director 
for development. The scholarships will be given to students from western 
Pennsylvania's Beaver Valley, Ditka's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka was an All-America tight end in 1960, his senior year at Pitt. He led the 
Panthers in receiving three consecutive years. Ditka also played basketball and 
baseball at Pitt.

10 SPLIT $1.3-MILLION PAYOFF IN PIMLICO DOUBLE-TRIPLE

<P>
A double-triple pool of more than $1.3 million that accumulated over 23 days of 
wagering at Pimlico Race Course has been won by 10 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Each winner in Saturday's double triple will receive $134,161.80 in the 
second-highest payout in Maryland thoroughbred racing history. 
</P>
<P>
The program generated a pari-mutuel handle of $4.28 million, and the 
double-triple alone drew $829,617 in wagers from a combined crowd of 19,319 at 
Pimlico and Laurel. It was the largest crowd in seven months and the biggest 
handle on any day, excluding Preakness Day, at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 winners had to pick the correct order of finish -- first, second and 
third -- in the third and fifth races. One of the winners was Andrew Beyer, who 
writes a racing column for the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's double-triple payoffs were short of the state record of $314,366 
that went to a syndicate of Washington-area professionals at Laurel on Feb. 17, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Parimutuel Director Elizabeth Quill said five of Saturday's winning tickets 
were bought at Pimlico, five at Laurel. The after-tax payoff was $107,329, she 
said.

MELVIN DURSLAG: RAIDERS FACE TOUGH ODDS SCORING WITH VOTERS IN OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is happening in Oakland right now in connection with the Raiders strikes 
terror in the heart of every mother's son who operates a sports franchise in 
this land. 
</P>
<P>
City government in Oakland has arranged up-front money, and a guarantee of more 
money over the years, in an effort to bring to gaff the football team. 
</P>
<P>
A grass-roots movement is afoot to stop the transaction until such time as 
folks go to the polls to decide whether they want it. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure goes to the polls, it is odds-on the deal is deceased, much to 
the distress of other owners whose leases will be expiring and, going on the 
muscle, may have to buck the dangerous precedent of voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of sports measures have a hard time winning at the polls because of 
the way the campaigns develop. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, for instance, one side would try to explain calmly that the team 
would be a spiritual and business asset to the community and, with a break, 
could pay off the debt the local government guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
This group would be bucking another shouting, "House the homeless, not the 
Raiders!" 
</P>
<P>
Most voters in a case like this don't understand the issues, but they do 
understand the homeless, education and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And, when the hollering match starts, those trying to explain the advantages of 
football will be suffocated by those screaming to stop the giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
What Oakland does with the Raiders is Oakland's business. Give 'em money, throw 
'em out, put proponents in jail -- it is of no concern here. No demand will be 
made that troops be sent there in any event. 
</P>
<P>
But, because of a referendum, Los Angeles came within a flick of losing the 
Dodgers shortly after their arrival in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
To bag this celebrated troupe from Brooklyn, Los Angeles, then without major 
league baseball, made a trade whereby it received a minor league park called 
Wrigley Field, owned by the Dodgers, in exchange for 300 acres in Chavez 
Ravine. 
</P>
<P>
A faction resenting Walter O'Malley, as an Oakland faction resents Al Davis, 
got a petition going and raised enough signatures to take the measure to the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed no contest. Sports fans, enraptured by the presence of big league 
baseball, loved the Dodgers. Almost uniformly, City Hall backed the team, as 
did the media. 
</P>
<P>
What supporters of the Dodgers didn't reckon with was the power of "Stop the 
land grab," the working slogan of the other side. 
</P>
<P>
In a city the size of Los Angeles, a preponderance of voters don't know the 
cutoff play from a hamburger sandwich. They see baseball as a nice little game, 
but not nice enough to win their support from guys hollering, "Stop the land 
grab." 
</P>
<P>
The media hurled all their artillery into the fight on behalf of the Dodgers. 
Movie stars, entertainers and celebrities appeared on a telethon to urge a vote 
for the Dodgers. The fight was unexpectedly bloody. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the end, the Dodgers sneaked in with less than 51% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the city would have lost the team, whose success in L.A. 
revolutionized sports on the West Coast. The gates would open for other 
baseball teams, for basketball and hockey teams, for a new football league. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't likely the Raiders in Oakland would have this impact, but the problems 
they would face in a referendum would not be dissimilar. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim knew how to raise money for a stadium. It arranged it without a vote. 
It got Anaheim a baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Next, without a vote, it arranged an enlargement of the stadium and handed out 
90 acres of valuable real estate to capture pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Meadowlands worked without a vote. So did Mayor Lindsay of New York when, to 
save the Yankees, he bankrolled a massive refurbishing job. 
</P>
<P>
Votes can be dangerous. Sports proponents took one in Cleveland for a domed 
stadium and lost. They lost in Miami and San Francisco. They can't get out of 
their tracks in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the voters for a new stadium in Los Angeles, and cries of "House the 
homeless" will knock you right out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
You will be drowned out trying to explain that money earmarked for a stadium 
would never be earmarked for the homeless, anyway . . . that stadium revenues 
over the years would be expected to pay off the debt . . . that nice facilities 
for those who pay taxes, and aren't homeless, are important in this society, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, the volatility of matters connected with the Raiders has 
been intriguing. Seeking to change locations, as teams had done for half a 
century, they land in an antitrust suit that lasts eight years. 
</P>
<P>
They land in an eminent domain suit that lasts three years. 
</P>
<P>
They land in a medical suit in which the owner of the Raiders is charged with 
causing the heart attack of a rival owner. 
</P>
<P>
They land a deal with Irwindale, which advances a $10-million deposit, and a 
city councilman in Los Angeles brings a taxpayer suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is dismissed, but Irwindale can't complete the deal anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in Oakland, leaders come up with a large package in order to get the 
Raiders, and constituents are yelling foul. 
</P>
<P>
If they prevail, the thrill of expiring contracts will be watered down for 
sports promoters all over.

ARKANSAS DERBY FIELD OFFERS A MIX

<P>
The Arkansas Derby should offer something for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
There are front-runners, one-run thoroughbreds, even a couple of trouble 
horses. And big-time jockeys galore. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's race at 1 1/8 miles is one of the final prep races for the May 5 
Kentucky Derby. By 4:50 p.m., some owners and trainers of 3-year-olds will be 
making plans for Louisville; others will be looking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it looks as if the Arkansas Derby will have a field of about 10. 
</P>
<P>
If you like speed, there's Bright Again, Real Cash and Wicked Destiny. 
</P>
<P>
* Bright Again set the early pace in the Hawthorne Juvenile last November but 
finished second. In his first start of the year March 3, he led almost all the 
way and won an allowance race in Florida. On March 31 in the Jim Beam Stakes, 
Bright Again led most of the way and got run down in the stretch by Summer 
Squall, one of the Kentucky Derby favorites. Pat Day picks up the mount. 
</P>
<P>
* Real Cash wired the field in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita on March 
18 and then was the pacesetter in the Santa Anita Derby. He eventually 
surrendered the lead to the other Derby favorite, unbeaten Mister Frisky. Alex 
Solis is to ride. 
</P>
<P>
* Wicked Destiny has won all three of his starts, and in two of his races he 
shows nothing but ones -- first, first, first, first. He won a maiden race at 
Oaklawn, showed courage to capture a small stakes and then shipped to Remington 
Park and led every step in the Remington Park Derby. John Lively is to ride 
Wicked Destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Tarascon and Hawaiian Pass fit in the next category. 
</P>
<P>
* Tarascon lost by a length to Mister Frisky in California and then came from 
slightly off the pace to win the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn by 12 lengths. In 
the March 31 Rebel -- Oaklawn's final Arkansas Derby prep -- Tarascon pushed 
the pace, was kept down on a slow rail by Dotsero and eventually made the lead 
before finishing third. Larry Snyder was aboard that day but may not get 
another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
* Hawaiian Pass beat Rebel winner Nuits St. Georges in California but was 
fourth in the Rebel. Fernando Toro looked like he had lots of horse in the 
turn, but he had no place to go. Down the stretch, Hawaiian Pass bulled between 
horses and got beat less than five lengths. Laffit Pincay Jr. is to ride 
Hawaiian Pass. 
</P>
<P>
For a thrill, Nuits St. Georges and Silver Ending are possibilities.

RAIDER LIEUTENANT BATCHELDER STRIKES OUT ON HIS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Batchelder isn't afraid of a scrap. Take, for example, the time he took 
on his hometown of Bartlesville, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
As the chief strategist for T. Boone Pickens in the mid-1980s, Batchelder 
helped orchestrate a surprise takeover attack on Bartlesville-based Phillips 
Petroleum Co. He pressed ahead even when the community fought back by 
distributing thousands of "Boone Buster" T-shirts, staging rallies and holding 
prayer vigils. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder's older brother, a Phillips accountant, was harassed by pranksters 
who had pizzas delivered to his house at all hours of the day. The two sides 
eventually declared a truce, but some people in Bartlesville still harbor hard 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Batchelder heads his own six-person investment firm in La Jolla, 
things have changed somewhat. He's no longer antagonizing entire communities, 
something he has done more than once. Still, Batchelder is girding for more 
takeover fights by launching a career as a corporate raider in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing what I love to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His timing might seem a little strange. Junk bond financing is running dry, and 
hostile takeovers are going out of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But those who know Batchelder, an imposing, white-haired bulldog of a man at 
age 40, don't expect him to be deterred. "He makes up his mind, and he moves in 
the direction he wants to go," said Pickens, who was Batchelder's boss for 10 
years. "He doesn't get distracted." 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder made his debut as a corporate raider last week by disclosing in a 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that he leads a partnership planning 
to bid for Pic 'N' Save, a Dominguez-based close-out retailer. Batchelder's 
group -- which includes Robert J. McNulty, chief executive of the HQ Office 
Supplies Warehouse chain -- said it has acquired 6.6% of Pic 'N' Save's stock 
for $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
For a man who helped make $700 million for Pickens on giant oil company raids 
and, more recently, more than $100 million for Los Angeles investor Marvin 
Davis on airline takeover bids, Pic 'N' Save would be a relatively small deal. 
But it clearly means more than that to Batchelder, who left his job with 
Pickens in Amarillo, Tex., two years ago to start his own firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really the first time he's been the party out front with his own 
investment on the line," said Joel L. Reed, an old friend and business partner 
of Batchelder who now is president of Insilco, a Fortune 500 manufacturing firm 
in Midland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Batchelder joins the ranks of big-time, multimillionaire players in the 
stock market, he retains some of the flavor of his small-town, middle-class 
Oklahoma upbringing. He is witty, friendly and sometimes jovial, but he also 
tries to avoid high-society parties and rarely plays golf or tennis. 
</P>
<P>
When Batchelder isn't working, he spends most of his time at his beachfront 
home with his wife of 18 years, Mary. He adopted, and is said to be very close 
to, the three children Mary had during her first marriage. With friends, 
Batchelder enjoys playing poker and gin, but he rarely risks more than $100 to 
$200 on a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't lost sight of the fact that $25 is a lot of money," said I.T. (Tex) 
Corley, who worked for Batchelder at Mesa and now is an executive with a 
Houston environmental services firm. 
</P>
<P>
During his days in Amarillo, Batchelder splurged on a red Corvette with a 
vanity license plate that read "Batch." He now drives a Lexus, which he 
described as "an old man's car," and there appear to be no Ferraris or Jaguars 
in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"If you met David out of the office, you'd never know he had a dime. He'd never 
tell you," said Dyann Brown, who was Batchelder's executive secretary in 
Amarillo and now is his office administrator in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder graduated from Oklahoma State University, and then joined what was 
the Big Eight accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells in Denver. After 
performing an audit on an energy company, he became intrigued by the oil and 
gas business and eventually decided to take a job at the Pickens operation now 
called Mesa Limited Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
At Mesa, he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming president. More 
important, he emerged as a creative financial whiz and the deal maker behind a 
series of raids on such companies as Gulf Oil that eventually led to an 
overhaul of the U.S. energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although the raid that drove Gulf into the arms of Chevron Corp. was Mesa's 
most profitable takeover effort, some of Batchelder's most difficult moments 
came in his company's pursuit of Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, Batchelder and others at Mesa were caught off guard by the clamor that 
erupted in Bartlesville, the one-company town where Phillips reigns. But 
throughout the bitter takeover struggle in his hometown, Batchelder showed no 
sign of caving in. "If it did take a toll on David, he kept it pretty much 
inside," Corley said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who also worked with Batchelder on the Phillips bid, said the takeover 
fight "was very tough on him, but you never heard him complain. He never 
alluded to it, but you knew it was there." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Batchelder said if he could have foreseen what happened in 
Bartlesville, he never would have gone ahead with the offer. Still, he said 
that Phillips and its shareholders are better off today for having been prodded 
into a reorganization. He also insisted that Mesa wasn't just looking for quick 
stock market profits but genuinely wanted to acquire Phillips and would have 
kept its headquarters in Bartlesville. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder, with characteristic self-assurance, brushes aside criticism that 
hostile takeovers eliminate jobs and disrupt people's lives. As he explained 
it, takeovers are just a way that troubled industries consolidate. An industry, 
he said, "has the same number of people that it's going to have" whether an 
individual company slims down through takeovers or other means. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlesville wasn't the only town where Batchelder created a stir. When he left 
Mesa, Batchelder inflamed emotions in Amarillo by calling the city "a truck 
stop" and saying he wanted out. Today, Batchelder says that remark was partly 
intended to head off reporters' questions about whether he and Pickens had a 
falling out, which both men deny. 
</P>
<P>
Since setting up Batchelder &amp; Partners in 1988, his biggest coups have come 
while serving as the principal adviser to Marvin Davis in his takeover bids 
last year for the companies that own Northwest Airlines and United Airlines. 
Although both bids failed, Davis walked away with hefty stock market profits. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder has also taken on much smaller deals, advising producer Daniel 
Grodnik and actor Tim Matheson in their takeover last year of National Lampoon 
Inc., the magazine publisher and movie producer. Last month, the company was 
sold again for $4.7 million in a deal handled by Batchelder, but Grodnik and 
Matheson are staying on as co-chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
Although National Lampoon's losses widened over the past year, Batchelder 
rejects the suggestion that the original deal was ill-conceived or that his 
clients were ill-prepared to run the company. Batchelder acknowledged that his 
two clients are "still learning" their jobs, but said he takes comfort in that 
the company's shareholders, by accepting the takeover bid, endorsed Grodnik and 
Matheson. 
</P>
<P>
Grodnik and Matheson -- who played the role of "Otter" in the 1978 movie 
"Animal House" -- say that the increased losses were expected in the early 
stages of their turnaround effort. They also bubble with praise for Batchelder. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got this charm," Grodnik said. "He just sort of smiles at you and says 
we're going to get this done, and that's all you need to know." 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder, citing SEC restrictions on what can be disclosed in the course of a 
takeover fight, declined to discuss any details concerning the expected bid for 
Pic 'N' Save, a chain of 189 close-out merchandise stores. He has already 
invested more than $1 million of his own money in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in general terms, however, Batchelder maintained that there still is 
plenty of money to be made in the takeover business even as other corporate 
raiders are retreating. In Batchelder's view, attractive companies are 
available at lower prices these days since junk bonds are no longer pumping up 
the stock market. At the same time, he said, there is more cash available for 
equity investments in takeover candidates because there are fewer deals 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder said he will make it a practice in his takeover campaigns to team 
with partners who are well qualified to manage the target companies, so that he 
will be ready to run an operation when a bid succeeds. In the case of Pic 'N' 
Save, that partner apparently is McNulty, who is considered an innovative 
retailing executive. 
</P>
<P>
The professional managers, however, will also be recruited to give the takeover 
bids legitimacy and to attract financing. In a candid admission, Batchelder 
said he normally figures he has no better than a 10% chance of actually 
acquiring a company that he "puts into play" in the takeover market. Much more 
often, he can make money by getting a takeover battle started and then bowing 
out to a higher bidder -- the way Pickens made his fortune in takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, sounding like a proud mentor, said he isn't surprised to see 
Batchelder making a splash for himself in the takeover business. "When he left, 
I knew we'd hear more from David," Pickens said.

U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM CATCHES A RISING STAR; 
</P>
<P>
SKIING: KRISTI TERZIAN DIDN'T WIN A WORLD CUP RACE, BUT 17 TIMES SHE FINISHED 
IN THE TOP 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
Skiing is winding down here in the Wasatch Mountains, but the U.S. ski team is 
already gearing up for next season, finding hope for renewed glory in the 
accomplishments of a young racer from, of all places, Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
This resort community near Salt Lake City is the team's home base, and the 
locals know the coaches and racers by sight, so when Kristi Terzian orders an 
apple juice in the Country Store deli, the woman behind the counter lights up. 
"It's you," she says. "You're a hero now." 
</P>
<P>
The hero -- or heroine, if you prefer -- didn't win any World Cup races this 
season, but she finished in the top 15 more times than any other American since 
the circuit was organized in 1967. Her 17 point-scoring races were one more 
than Tamara McKinney piled up in the 1983-84 season, and they were more 
astonishing because they were so unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
Diann Roffe, the 1985 world champion in giant slalom, was supposed to be 
McKinney's successor as America's brightest female skiing star, and she well 
may be after finishing 10th in the women's overall standings with 130 points. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian wound up 17th with 93 points, but her string of fine results came as a 
surprise to everyone, among them Alpine Director John McMurtry, who said: "She 
had just a tremendous season, her best year ever. She was by far the most 
improved racer on the team." 
</P>
<P>
From her own vantage point, Terzian said, "It was a good season, but it wasn't 
a great season. I can't be satisfied with how things went this year. I have 
higher goals, and I hope to reach them in the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian, who will turn 23 Sunday, plans "definitely" to race for two more years 
but said: "Actually, the next four years are big years. There's either a World 
Championships or an Olympics in (each of those) years, and obviously, at that 
level I'd like to win medals. But first I'd like to win a World Cup race, and I 
came close this year." 
</P>
<P>
The closest was her second place in a giant slalom on March 10 at Stranda, 
Norway, where she finished just .66 seconds behind Carole Merle of France. 
</P>
<P>
For Terzian, whose mother escaped from Armenia during the Stalin era and has 
never returned, international ski-racing has literally been a series of ups and 
downs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been on the World Cup on and off," she said. "And I was off because I 
wasn't having the results. So (this year), I was able to stay on the World Cup 
the entire year because I was having the results. And now I know that's where I 
belong. I'm comfortable on that circuit, and with the surroundings in Europe, 
and I know it's just going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
She said there is no single reason for her sudden improvement, adding: "I think 
it was a bunch of little things that I changed. I realized what was important 
to focus on in my dry-land training, in my on-snow training. And I got rid of 
all the other little distractions that are not necessary and that (had) stopped 
me from reaching the top." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Letting other teammates bother me," she said. "Letting changing in scheduling 
bother me, just little problems that I can't control. And there's no sense in 
me worrying about it and stressing out about it when I can't change things. I 
can only control my life and my own surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"Just listening to other people saying what a hectic year it was, I found that, 
for me, it felt like things went very smoothly. There were a lot of (schedule) 
changes, but they weren't drastic changes. The snow was always good where we 
raced. So, that wasn't a real factor for me. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, (Europe) is difficult, it's intimidating. This was the first year I 
felt like I belonged there. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I spent a month there (last) spring on my own time (along with 
teammates McKinney and Edith Thys), going to school in Kitzbuhel (Austria), 
trying to learn German, and that was the first time I was in Europe on a purely 
non-competitive basis. I was there to see Europe, to do a little school. And I 
think that may have been a factor for me, because I saw things in a different 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't there as a U.S. ski team member -- just having someone hold my hand 
and drag me around to all the different races. It was different, I was on my 
own schedule. I had my own program, and I had more control, and that's how I 
went into Europe this (season). I wanted to control the situation, and I was 
able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't intimidated by the other competitors. I wasn't looking at girls and 
going, 'Wow, there's Maria Walliser,' or, 'There's Vreni (Schneider).' I felt 
like I was equal. It's not the same for everyone, but the first year I was 
overwhelmed. I was impressed, and now I'm impressed with me, and I know that I 
can be right there with the rest of those girls." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian injured her right knee in early 1986 and was off skis for about two 
months. Then, she pulled ligaments in the same knee on Jan. 5, 1987, when she 
fell during a race at Saalbach, Austria, and missed the rest of that season. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's at a point where it's a strong knee," she said. "You know, the year 
after, you think about it, and it's a factor. But these last two years, it's 
been good." 
</P>
<P>
Did her injury make her more determined to succeed? 
</P>
<P>
"It did, definitely," she said. "I was behind the rest of my group coming out 
of it, but it did give me more determination." 
</P>
<P>
There were other motivational factors at work. 
</P>
<P>
"In '88, it was between Diann and me going into the last race, for the last 
spot on the U.S. Olympic team. Then last year before the World Championships, 
it was between Eva (Twardokens) and me. In fact, they named both Eva and me, 
and then we had qualification runs a couple of days before the giant slalom (at 
Vail, Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
"I wound up as the alternate both times. So, I think that was something that 
really motivated me a lot. I was in so much pain from both of those situations, 
so disappointed in myself, I just said that I had to change things, and I did. 
</P>
<P>
"Last spring, they put me on the Europa Cup team. I was with a bunch of girls 
that were very much younger than I, and I was going to some of the worst places 
in the world. We went to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia. We went to the Soviet Union. 
It was an experience I'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
"But I learned a really good lesson on that trip, and that was, No. 1, I'm in 
this sport to have fun, and racing is part of that, but if you're not enjoying 
what you're doing, then you should get out. 
</P>
<P>
"And I had a day of training that was going just terribly. I was crying, and I 
suddenly just had this thought that either I had to change things or get out. 
And I think that in my mind somewhere I started listening in a different way 
and started focusing on what was important. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of brought me through to my summer training. I wouldn't necessarily 
do things because I thought, 'This is what I have to do,' I would do things 
that I would have fun at -- play soccer and tennis -- along with the hard work 
and the things that you have to do in the weight room. But having fun is why 
I'm doing this, and that has to be part of it. I had lost that for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I trained more specifically. When I did train, I made it quality, 100%. And 
then even in the on-snow training, I tried to just really focus in on my runs 
that we were going to take for that day, and I often would make myself go last 
on the courses (after they became rutted), because I knew that's where I would 
be starting. I was never first on the practice courses. I wanted to make it as 
difficult as possible for myself. 
</P>
<P>
"And another factor was that when we were training as a group, as we always do, 
I would try to separate myself from the rest of the girls, so that I had 
complete concentration, 100%, from top to bottom. And I think that just came 
over into the races." 
</P>
<P>
So, is there still room for improvement? 
</P>
<P>
"Very much so, because this year I had two runs, maybe three, that I felt were 
the best runs I could produce," Terzian said. "And I feel like I can be at a 
point where I can have those runs all the time, and when that happens, then 
I'll be at the top, then I'll be at my peak. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second run (at Stranda) I made a very big mistake, and I virtually 
stopped on a gate. I was second going into the second run, and I thought, 'It's 
over. There's no chance for me to even be in the top 10.' But I jumped around 
the gate and kept going, and I think the second half (of that run) I must have 
skied very well, because I ended up in second. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself as a good slalom skier, (but) I feel I have the potential to be a 
lot better in giant slalom than I do in slalom. The way I'm built, I have more 
of a build for a giant slalom and super-G skier." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian welcomes the competition with Roffe, 23, who has regained her form of 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very strong," Terzian said of her teammate. "And I feel like for both of 
us, it's nice that we have each other's results and just each other to train 
against and to compete against, because when you have that kind of level on our 
own team, it's something to work for. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's helped us all. We have a really young team right now, also. Diann 
and I are the two oldest. There's Eva, she's a couple of years older, also. But 
the other girls are 19 . . . 20, so that's pretty young." 
</P>
<P>
With McKinney, 27, sidelined by serious knee and leg injuries last fall, Roffe 
and Terzian gradually assumed leadership roles on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we're going to miss Tamara if she decides to retire," Terzian 
said. "If she stays, I think that's great also, because she's one of the best 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think maybe, for myself, when we had Tamara here, she was the one who 
everyone was looking at, she was the one who was always winning the races, 
always in the top three, and it never put any attention on us. And maybe it was 
easy for us just to kind of cruise along and not get the results, and no one 
would really bother, because Tamara was there to have the results. 
</P>
<P>
"And then when she got hurt, I think maybe the added pressure was something 
that helped me break through the barrier. It's kind of strange how that 
happened, like maybe we came out of her shadow a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, the 1983 World Cup overall champion, still hasn't decided whether she 
will come back for a 14th season with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian said: "I don't know (what McKinney will do). . . . She came to our 
nationals (at Crested Butte, Colo., in late February), and we were all real 
happy to see her, and I was just with her a few days ago in Vail at the Jimmie 
Heuga Express Finals. She wants to stay involved. I don't know what her plans 
are. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. In fact, she just started skiing. 
She was just cruising around. But she was on skis." 
</P>
<P>
As for being a new leader of the team, Terzian said: "Skiing is a very 
individual sport. It's difficult because we travel as a team and train as a 
team, but when you're in the race, you're racing against your teammates and 
everyone else in the world. Actually, I had my first encounter with (being a 
leader) at the nationals between runs of the giant slalom. One of the younger 
girls, Megan Garety -- I believe she's like 18, very young -- she was in third 
after the first run, and we were inspecting (the course), and she came up to me 
and said, 'What are you going to do in that under gate? Are you going to come 
off it a little bit?' 
</P>
<P>
"And that was when it hit me. I thought, 'This girl is only three-tenths (of a 
second) behind me, and she's asking me for advice!' But I realized that now I'm 
in that role, and I'm willing to help." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian told Garety how she planned to take the gate, then went back up and won 
the race. Would she have had second thoughts if the younger racer had won? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," she said. "I knew in my mind exactly what I needed to do, 
and if I could help her out, great, and that wasn't going to affect my result." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian remembered receiving help herself as a young skier -- from two older 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in Fresno and we later lived in Sanger until I was 14," she said. 
"Then I moved to Lake Tahoe, to Incline Village (Nev.), and went to school 
there. The first year, we all moved up there, except my father. He would 
commute back and forth from our home in Sanger. My dad is an almond- and 
grape-grower, and my mom is a schoolteacher. So my dad stayed and was working 
on the ranch, and he would come up on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I moved up to Tahoe, I skied at a little place called China Peak (now 
Sierra Summit), which was an hour and a half from our home. And it was a great 
area to grow up at. I started when I was 3 and just cruised all around that 
mountain. I have two older sisters, and as each of us came along, we started 
younger and younger. Karen -- she was the oldest -- started when she was 7. And 
my middle sister (started) when she was 5. Then I came along and I started when 
I was 3. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad and mom both skied. But in fact, it was my uncle who got us all going. 
He bought my oldest sister her first pair of skis. So that's kind of what 
started it all, and then the whole family got involved. And next thing we knew, 
my dad was running us back and forth up to Tahoe because that's where most of 
the racing was done -- every weekend. And then it just got too much, all the 
races. We all began to get better and better. My middle sister (Katrina) was on 
the junior national team. So that's why we moved up to Tahoe, and we were there 
for about three years. I went to a ski academy, called Ski Etude. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I went to Salt Lake City. I finished my high school there at Rowmark Ski 
Academy -- my sister (Katrina) came also -- and I've resided here ever since. 
I'm attending the University of Utah right now. I'm in my sophomore year and 
only go a quarter a year, usually in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult growing up in the area I grew up in, because there's no snow. 
Most of my other teammates had a much better situation than I did. I came from 
Central California. People always laugh. They say, 'You're a skier, and you're 
from Fresno?' My parents had to sacrifice a lot to put me through school, and 
private schools are very expensive. The farming business hasn't been so great. 
My dad's kind of pulling himself out of debt, slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you have the determination and the talent to make it, you're going to 
make it one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian credited her sisters with pushing her along in racing. 
</P>
<P>
"We were competitive," she said. "And I was able to learn from the mistakes 
they went through." 
</P>
<P>
Why did she go on racing after her sisters quit? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," she said. "I guess it's because I was a little more successful 
than they were. And then I had a few bad years. There were many times these 
past few years when I thought, 'I should give this up and go to school and get 
on with the rest of my life.' And then the other part of me would say, 'You 
only get this opportunity once, and if you don't try your best to make it, 
you're going to regret it some day, when you're sitting behind a desk, 
wondering why you didn't give it another shot.' So, I have no regrets. I'm glad 
I stuck it out." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian said her mother, Virginia, is especially proud of having a daughter on 
the U.S. ski team. 
</P>
<P>
"She left (the Soviet Union after World War II) when she was only 5, with her 
mother," Terzian said. "Her father had been taken away to Siberia. She'd never 
met her father. She has two older sisters that they left behind and had to 
bring out later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually three-quarters Armenian. Her mother was Armenian, and her father 
was Russian. My father is 100% Armenian, but he was born in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"When I raced in the Soviet Union, it was at an area very close to Armenia, and 
immediately, because of my name, they knew I was Armenian, so I had a lot of 
people coming up to me, asking me about my heritage and my family. My mother 
was excited for me to go and see a little bit of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Vail for the Jimmie Heuga Express, and the reason I did that, 
actually, is because my mother has (multiple sclerosis), and that event 
(benefits) the MS center." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Terzian finds ski racing a trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like, for a girl my age, I'm lacking a lot of things because I 'm not 
going to school," she said. "But with the traveling, I'm much more 
knowledgeable in different areas, and I don't feel like I'm missing out on 
anything, because when I come home, I have such a good group of friends who 
kind of take me into their college life when I'm here. It's nice -- I have the 
best of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice just walking around town here, or anywhere lately. . . . I've been 
on campus, or in Vail. . . . People, Americans even, recognize my name and they 
recognize my results this year. And it's so nice to have people come up to you 
and say, you know, 'I saw that run on TV and that was great. We're very proud 
of you.' I think that just gets me more motivated to do even better." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, who succeeded Harald Schoenhaar as U.S. Alpine director after the 
1988 Winter Olympics, said Terzian was one of the principal reasons for his 
team's improvement this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was ranked 64th in the world in slalom to start the year off," 
McMurtry said. "She's now ranked in the first seed in two events (super-G and 
GS), and she's 17th or 18th in slalom. She's really positioning herself for 
some exciting years. 
</P>
<P>
"The injuries have been a big reason why she hasn't had this kind of year 
(before). She's athletically more mature now and she's got some experience, so 
I think everything just kind of came together for her. She's got a really good 
attitude and a good perspective about the sport and what she can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, 39, coached the U.S. women technical skiers from 1976 to '84. He said 
that this has been a season of "definite progress." 
</P>
<P>
"Any way you look at it, it was an up year," he said. "A year ago, we scored 
232 (World Cup) points, and Tamara (McKinney) scored half of those (116). This 
year, without Tamara, we scored 367 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 11th (in the Nations' Cup) last year; we were eighth this year. The 
number of athletes scoring World Cup points last year was 10; this year it was 
16 -- that's nine women and seven men. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of top-15 performances a year ago was 30, and Tamara had 11 of 
those; this year, the team had 57 (of which Terzian had 17). 
</P>
<P>
"A.J. Kitt looks like he's going to be first seed (among the first 15 starters) 
in downhill. He had a fourth and a sixth this year, and he should be 14th on 
the FIS list. He started the year ranked in the 70s in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Diann Roffe is first seed now in three events. She's the first three-event 
first-seeder that we've had since Cindy Nelson (in the 1970s and early '80s). 
</P>
<P>
"Then this young guy (Nate Bryan, 19) had a really outstanding year. He won the 
Europa Cup finals giant slalom, the first (American) since Greg Jones in 1975 
to do so. He's a really exciting young kid. He started 29th, was 13th after the 
first run and won the second run by a second. He beat Patrick Staub, who's the 
Swiss national giant slalom champion this year. 
</P>
<P>
"So, it was a year of improvement, but we're not satisfied. We're eighth. We 
feel we shouldn't be eighth. Our goal is to be No. 1, but I think you have to 
look at it and say we're going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry attributed Kitt's downhill charge to better conditioning, saying: "I 
think that whole downhill group has worked very hard on conditioning. We've put 
a major emphasis on that for the entire team, but particularly these guys. 
Downhill is a strength and power event. So, Kitt has really improved his 
conditioning and strength, and I think that had a lot to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think attitude was another thing. These guys believe that they can do 
something, and that's half the battle -- the belief that they can be there. 
</P>
<P>
"Kitt is 22 now. A year ago, the average age of the men's downhill winners on 
the World Cup circuit was 29, with about nine years of experience. And this is 
(only) his second full season on the World Cup tour. So, he's got room for a 
lot of improvement, but he's a real talent." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry is also looking for a return to form by Kyle Wieche, 22, and Felix 
McGrath, 27. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago in giant slalom, Wieche had two or three top-10 results," McMurtry 
said. "This year, he broke his hand in December and had to have surgery, had to 
have a pin put in it. It was kind of a freaky injury, and he just never quite 
got everything put back together in his skiing. But he's going to be there. 
He's a talented athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"McGrath has had a shoulder injury and just had surgery. If he can stay 
injury-free, Felix has the talent to win. It's up to him." 
</P>
<P>
As for McKinney, McMurtry said: "She hasn't decided (whether to retire). It was 
a very bad injury, and I think she wants to wait and see how it's coming along 
and how far she can go. It was a knee and also a (leg) fracture, and it was a 
very complicated, difficult injury. I don't know. She hasn't announced 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, who said, "I'm committed through Albertville (the 1992 Winter 
Olympics in France), and then we'll see after that where we're going," cited 
two principal changes that he has made in the team's program. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to really emphasizing conditioning, No. 1," he said. "We felt 
that it was something we really needed to emphasize. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing we've emphasized is our development program. The last three 
years, we've put $1.5 million into athlete development, that's athletes below 
the national team level. After '84, there was a drastic cutback in funding for 
development. . . . We've streamlined our structure. We have a top-to-bottom 
program now, which we've never had before, meaning a program that goes all the 
way from the top World Cup level to the grass-roots programs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget for the coming year is $2.8 million for the entire Alpine program. 
We're in a position now that we can budget a program in April for the whole 
year and not have any fear that we're going to have a cut. Financially, we're 
very stable, and we've signed on some new corporate sponsors that are really 
excited about the program. The money goes for training the athletes, room and 
board, travel, coaching salaries, our sports medicine program, etc." 
</P>
<P>
The team also gets equipment from a pool of suppliers, which McMurtry estimated 
is worth an additional $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some great athletes up through '84 but we didn't develop anything 
behind that, and that's where we ran into problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear a lot that there are other sports our young athletes can get into, 
but we've got 6 or 7 million really hard-core skiers in this country -- that's 
the population of Switzerland -- and out of that we should be able to find some 
talent that can win. And I'm convinced we can. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're always looking at and trying to figure out is how to 
get younger kids into the sport, kids who may not be able to (compete) because 
of the cost factor. And with our development program, I think we're starting to 
keep younger athletes who might have turned to other sports at some point." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there is more money to be made in several other sports, 
McMurtry said: "We're working on some ideas to change that, too. This 
prize-money issue that we're going to be fighting hard for at the FIS 
(International Ski Federation) Congress in May -- that there be prize money in 
racing -- I think this is going to be very important for the development of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It would create more excitement, and we want to start it as soon as possible. 
It would make skiing a big-time event in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Now, racers receive money from their various supplier contracts for victories 
and high placings, through programs administered by their national teams or 
federations, but prize money put up by race organizers or television sponsors 
is not permissible under FIS or Olympic rules. 
</P>
<P>
To "bring another dimension to the program," McMurtry said he has hired Bryan 
Williams, captain of the University of Houston's 1983 NCAA Final Four 
basketball team, as conditioning coach for the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is the first black to be associated with the team at the national 
level, but he may not be the last. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there might be any black skiers who could be developed into racers, 
McMurtry said: "Absolutely. It's (a matter of) economics right now. But we're 
going to explore ways that we can do that. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan wasn't hired for that reason. He was hired because he was the best guy 
available for the position. But Bryan has got some ideas, too, that he wants to 
explore. There's a lot of great young talent out there that we don't tap yet." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, who was the racing coach at China Peak in 1974 through '76, said he 
recently came across a photo of one of his teams there, and "Kristi Terzian is 
in there. She's about this big." He put his hand close to the ground. "She had 
two sisters who were older who were tremendous there. She was awfully young 
then, about 9 or 10." 
</P>
<P>
And as Terzian has just shown, a year or two can make a big difference.

Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga, a one-time stevedore who fought first for his country 
in World War II , next for statehood for his beloved Hawaii and lastly for 
reparations for fellow Japanese-Americans interned in American camps during the 
war, died Sunday in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the twice-wounded veteran of the fabled "Go for Broke" 442nd 
Army Regimental Combat Team of Japanese-Americans -- the most decorated combat 
unit in U.S. history -- said the three-term Senate Democrat died in a Toronto 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Greaney said in a statement issued from Washington that Matsunaga, 73, died 
of cancer at Toronto General Hospital after being admitted to an oncology 
clinic last week for treatment of prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga had said in January that he was battling the cancer that eventually 
spread to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
With him when he died were his wife, Helene, and two of his five children. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga had been in failing health since a 1984 heart attack, an attack of 
ulcers in 1987 and flu and back problems in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga was often in the shadow of Hawaii's better-known senator, fellow 
Democrat Daniel K. Inouye, another member of the so-called "Class of 54," which 
developed an ongoing power base that led to statehood for the territory in 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite his casual style and outgoing manner he could be a consummate 
politician when it involved legislation close to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, in 1988, he was credited with engineering passage of a 
$1.25-billion law that is to pay $20,000 to each surviving Japanese-American 
interned in a U.S. prison camp during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga had been awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart with cluster after 
he was wounded twice in combat with the 442nd, a regiment that became famous 
during the war for its exploits in Europe and again when it was the subject of 
a 1951 film. 
</P>
<P>
But in fighting for the internment law he not only had to overcome objections 
from cost-conscious congressmen but from some fellow veterans who continued to 
harbor wartime grudges. 
</P>
<P>
During one debate on the bill, tears forced Matsunaga to quit speaking while 
telling of an elderly internee killed by a guard as he went to pick up a 
softball. 
</P>
<P>
"I myself become overly emotional when I think about it even to this day," he 
said after regaining his composure. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga also lobbied for 22 years before persuading Congress in 1984 to 
establish a U.S. Peace Institute. "Peacemaking is as much an art to be learned 
as war," was his persistent argument. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga supported a joint U.S.-Soviet exploration of Mars, sponsored a plan 
for an International Space Year in 1992 and worked to make his state a center 
for space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga was first elected to the House in 1962 and served six terms. He was 
elected to the Senate in 1976 and reelected in 1982 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At his death he was the second-ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee and 
chairman of its subcommittee on taxation and debt management. 
</P>
<P>
Before his years in Washington, Matsunaga was a member of Hawaii's territorial 
House from 1954 to 1959. 
</P>
<P>
He was born on Kauai, the son of immigrants from Japan. He worked as a 
stevedore and warehouseman while going to high school and graduated with honors 
from the University of Hawaii and Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
He taught school briefly before joining the 100th Infantry Battalion, which 
later became part of the 442nd. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Hawaii Gov. John Waihee asked that the body lie in state Wednesday 
in the state Capitol. Burial will be at the National Memorial Cemetery of the 
Pacific at Punchbowl in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Waihee said of Matsunaga: "He will be remembered most for his vision of peace 
and his faith in the human heart. In his memory we will carry on his quest. In 
his spirit we will strive for the highest of principles and the brightest of 
worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Daniel K. Akaka, a Hawaii Democrat elected to the House in 1976, is 
considered the leading choice to be appointed to Matsunaga's post, pending a 
special election in November.

Marco Aurelio Robles, president of Panama from 1964 to 1968, has died in a 
Miami hospital after a long illness, his family said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Robles was 84 and had lived in Florida since he turned the presidency over to 
Arnulfo Arias Madrid in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Arias Madrid, however, was quickly ousted in a military coup led by Gen. Omar 
Torrijos. 
</P>
<P>
Robles' family said he died Saturday after a long illness but did not provide 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Robles was general manager of the Panamanian National Bank, minister of 
government and justice, and a deputy in the National Assembly before becoming 
president in 1964, in an election filled with charges of irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, after lengthy clashes between U.S. students and Panamanians over a 
ruling that Panamanian and American flags be hoisted simultaneously at a school 
in the Canal Zone, Robles signed a joint declaration with President Lyndon B. 
Johnson agreeing to draw up a new Panama Canal treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Robles' remaining years in office were filled with ongoing charges over the 
supposed rigging of the 1964 election and other political infighting. He 
survived impeachment proceedings but went into exile after his candidate for 
the presidency, David Samudio, was defeated by Arias Madrid on May 12, 1968.
