RAIDERS MAKE A COMMITMENT TO OXNARD CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It looks like Al Davis and the Raiders are staying -- in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
It may be uncertain where the team will play its regular season games in a few 
years, but it will continue to hold its six-week summer training camp in 
Ventura County, officials said. The Oxnard City Council and Raiders 
representatives last week reached a tentative agreement to extend a five-year 
agreement to keep the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider formal approval of the agreement during a council 
meeting next week, Assistant City Manager John Tooker said. Raiders 
representatives are expected to sign the agreement sometime next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tooker said the agreement would be binding regardless of whether the Raiders 
play at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum or in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year agreement, which would include four one-year options as well as an 
additional five-year option, would require the Raiders to pay $1 a year to hold 
summer training on city-owned land near the River Ridge Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Raiders built two football fields and a field house on the land. 
For its part, the city helped buy the property and solicit a developer to build 
the Radisson Suite Hotel, which has been used to house the football team and 
its staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The Raiders field agreement was never envisioned as being a substantial 
revenue producer in itself," Tooker said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, civic leaders originally sought to lure the Raiders to Oxnard as a way 
to generate publicity for the city, said Mayor Nao Takasugi. "It sort of gives 
us some good PR." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Varley, executive director of the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau, 
agreed that national sports coverage of the Raiders has generated some 
publicity for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't hurt to see the Oxnard byline," he said. "But it hasn't been that 
big a deal as far as drawing droves of people here." 
</P>
<P>
He said an average of two or three visitors per day ask for directions to watch 
the team practice. However, Varley said, the visitors are disappointed to learn 
that the training sessions are closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Varley said, the football players and their staff, which total about 140 
people, spend about $500,000 a year in the city, mostly at restaurants and 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said he looks forward to keeping the Raiders in Oxnard. "Certainly, if 
they are willing to come, we will welcome them with open arms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the deal was originally signed in April, 1985, city officials hoped that 
the Radisson would generate enough revenue to help pay off a $9-million bond 
that the city issued to help buy the hotel land and develop its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
But because of an overly optimistic financial forecast and competition from 
nearby hotels, the Radisson initially was unable to pay its annual $985,000 in 
rental payments to the city. However, the outlook for the hotel has improved. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burk, director of sales and marketing for Radisson, said the city 
renegotiated the contract last year to include a new schedule for repaying the 
owed rent. And, he said, the hotel has hired a new management team, which has 
increased business. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard adverse reports on the Radisson," Takasugi said. "We are 
getting our share of the occupancy. They are doing well." 
</P>
<P>
THE COLISEUM WILL STAY 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances" will it be demolished, its managers pledge. B7

ROSE CANYON FAULT DESIGNATED ACTIVE HAZARD; 
</P>
<P>
QUAKES: THE DECISION COULD HURT PROPERTY VALUES IN THE EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS 
FROM LA JOLLA TO DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO.

<P>
In a move that could rattle the property values of some San Diego homes, state 
geologists say they intend to upgrade the Rose Canyon fault to an active 
earthquake hazard that could slip and destroy homes in some of the heavily 
populated areas around Mt. Soledad park and east of Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The state's Division of Mines and Geology has already declared "special study 
zones" in rural areas of San Diego County, but its current proposal would be 
the first to officially raise the specter of a potential earthquake along the 
fault that runs under the high-priced neighborhoods of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, 
Clairemont, as well as downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The big concern is that the fault may produce an earthquake in the city of San 
Diego," said senior state geologist Earl Hart, who has overseen the state's 
efforts to map active fault lines for 17 years. "And the questions are, 'How 
big?' 'What's the probability?' and 'When?' " 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State University geology professor Thomas Rockwell determined that 
the Rose Canyon fault was active after he took underground samples last summer 
at a utility construction site along Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the earthquake there would happen within the next 500 years 
and register from 6.25 to 6.75 on the Richter scale -- the size of temblors 
that rocked the San Fernando Valley in 1971 and Coalinga in 1983, but 
considerably smaller than the 7.1 temblor that shook the Bay Area last October. 
</P>
<P>
"It would feel like someone was pulling the rug out from under your feet," said 
Rockwell. "A lot of chimneys would go down, and a lot of glass would break. 
There would be some structural damage." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, state geologists have always considered the fault potentially 
active, but lacked the proof to warrant the official designation as a truly 
active earthquake site. 
</P>
<P>
Now, spurred by Rockwell's research and prediction, state geologists have drawn 
up maps proposing the special study zone -- an official designation that warns 
of possible ground movement during an earthquake -- along 2 to 3 miles of the 
Rose Canyon fault as it runs under the La Jolla Cove, through Mt. Soledad, and 
across Interstate 5 into western Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
The maps also indicate the possibility of the state imposing the earthquake 
zoning on two shorter, quarter-mile legs of the Rose Canyon fissure that have 
been discovered near the new San Diego Police Department headquarters downtown, 
along 12th Avenue between C and E streets. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state's plan, the special studies zone could cut a swath ranging from 
200 to 500 feet on either side of where the fault is determined to touch the 
Earth's surface. Hart said all the initial work on deciding where to put the 
zones won't be finished until next March, with a final designation possible by 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was disclosed to city officials in a March 21 letter, which asks 
for more information about the fault line between Clairemont and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said this week that his staff is working carefully on the Rose Canyon 
proposal because it is a "very sensitive" move that could hurt the values of 
buildings that lie within the special studies zone. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason, he said, is a state law that forces homeowners and 
landlords to disclose the existence of an active fault to prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, any residential or commercial property owner within the zone who 
attempts development or extensive renovation would be required to conduct a 
geological inspection to make sure any new construction is set back at least 50 
feet from the fault line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if the fault goes through your property it is going to lower the 
value of your property," Hart said. "So, we don't want to overzone and . . . I 
don't want people to be unnecessarily alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aware that it is an exclusive area, and they have a lot of homes, and we 
want to make sure the fault is identifiable before we go in and zone it." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie McLaughlin, president of the San Diego Assn. of Realtors, agreed that 
the state's actions would hurt some property values on the hillside homes, 
which county tax roles show have fetched between $400,000 and $940,000 in 
recent transactions. But McLaughlin, who once lived in a house on the fault in 
Clairemont, said she would expect the effect to wear off in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some buyers won't buy because of it, I can tell you that right now, and 
especially if they are from another area and they won't know the meaning of 
it," said McLaughlin, an agent with Century 21. "Other buyers, it's not going 
to affect them. They're used to living in California. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, there are some people who think they should get the property 
for substantially lower because of that fact," she said. "After that, it will 
become business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin also said that San Diego real estate agents have normally disclosed 
the presence of the Rose Canyon fault to prospective buyers even when the 
fissure was not thought to be active. 
</P>
<P>
Although geologists have long been suspicious of the fault, they have failed in 
the past to find any evidence that it was an active threat to San Diego, a city 
that until now has been regarded as one of the safer spots in Southern 
California for temblors. It has always been overshadowed by fissures that were 
demonstrably active, such as the infamous San Andreas fault, which runs through 
San Francisco Bay and east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
State geologists have imposed the special study zones throughout the state 
extensively since they were given that power under a 1973 law. So far, the 
state has declared special study zones over active earthquake faults running 
through 33 counties, including along the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults that 
run through rural portions of northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
But the state abruptly turned its attention to Rose Canyon, within the San 
Diego city limits, after SDSU geologist Rockwell conducted trenching and 
unearthed the first evidence last summer of recent geological activity on San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric property on Santa Fe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery caused state geologists to reconsider the fact that small parts 
of the fault were documented in 1984 during the excavation for the new downtown 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Rose Canyon fault is developed on, and that's part of the 
problem," Rockwell said Wednesday. "Much of the canyon fault zone was developed 
on by the '30s and '40s, and it is a very difficult fault to study because so 
much of it is under asphalt and buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said Wednesday that carbon-dating tests on samples taken from seven 
spots along the fault in La Jolla and near Mission Bay show that there has 
definitely been activity in the recent geological past -- about 11,000 years in 
seismological terms. He said the fault has shown repeated movements within the 
last 7,000 years, and a surface rupture as recently as the last 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rockwell's research has prompted new interest in the Rose Canyon 
fault, state geologists still consider it to be less a threat than the San 
Andreas. Rockwell said the more notorious fault is considered 20 times stronger 
and more likely to yield an earthquake than Rose Canyon in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important fault, but I'm not sure I would call it a major fault," Hart 
said of the Rose Canyon fissure.

PANEL RULES NEPOTISM RULES WERE BROKEN; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL SERVICE: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED COUNTY 
GUIDELINES BY ALLOWING A DIVISION HEAD TO KEEP HIS NEW WIFE ON HIS STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Civil Service Commission, after reviewing summaries of 
complaints from about 20 workers, concluded Wednesday that Dist. Atty. Michael 
D. Bradbury has violated county nepotism rules by allowing a division head to 
keep his new wife on staff. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, on a 4-0 vote, also recommended that the County Board of 
Supervisors transfer ombudsman Margaret Escobar Trom out of the Child Support 
Division run by her husband of six months, C. Stanley Trom. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Bradbury's lawyer, commission Chairman Robert Embry abstained 
from voting. Embry said that he had not prejudged the issue but that his 
previous comments to reporters that blatant nepotism exists in the district 
attorney's office might have created that impression. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report is expected to be on the Board of Supervisors' agenda 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
The board delayed action this week on Bradbury's request that the supervisors 
find that the Trom marriage has created no nepotism problem -- or waive a 
county rule that says "no person shall be employed in a position directly or 
indirectly supervised by a member of his immediate family." 
</P>
<P>
Most county supervisors did not want to act without having the Civil Service 
recommendations in hand, Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who has characterized the Civil Service Commission as a tool of the 
employee union that filed the Trom complaint, would not comment Wednesday. 
Previously, he has denied that his office has violated county work rules. 
</P>
<P>
Trom, who said Tuesday that he had never accorded his wife special treatment at 
work, also declined comment on the commission's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has indicated that we will make our response to the Board of 
Supervisors," Trom said. "I'm comfortable with that." 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Service Commission's actions are an endorsement of the findings of 
staff adviser Ray Charles, who conducted an investigation after a Feb. 6 
complaint by the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
In a summary report, Charles said that, since 1985, numerous employees have 
complained to their superiors about the conduct of Escobar Trom and asked to be 
transferred from the small work teams she has headed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints "went unanswered or unresolved," Charles said. "In time, 
Ms. Escobar was perceived as one who enjoyed 'most favored status' because of 
her relationship with the director." 
</P>
<P>
Trom has said that he and his wife lived together for several years before they 
were married. There is no county rule against a supervisor living with a 
subordinate as long as they are not married. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Charles said he based his conclusions on conversations with 
about 20 family-support officers, about half of the 40 workers in that section 
of the Child Support Division. 
</P>
<P>
"They all shared the same litany of complaints," he said. Most complaints 
involved "just the day-to-day relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Trom. They 
felt, for example, that Mrs. Trom did not carry a workload comparable" to those 
of other supervising officers. 
</P>
<P>
They were especially critical of her for taking time off to attend conferences 
with Trom before and after they were married, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
"She spent a lot of time away from the office and in her absence others had to 
assume her workload," he said. "No other employee gets the opportunity to go to 
that many conferences." 
</P>
<P>
Trom said earlier this week that his wife has taken unpaid leave to join him at 
quarterly conferences. But, he said, he has never turned down a request for 
unpaid leave for any of his employees. His wife also has attended conferences 
on her own time while her co-workers were paid to attend to avoid allegations 
of favoritism, Trom has said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles' finding that there is a history of complaints about Escobar Trom 
seemed to surprise her husband. Trom said he was unaware of a single complaint 
by workers about his relationship with his wife before they were married. 
Charles said the complaints were filed with the chief family service officer, 
who reports directly to Trom. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Carolyn Goldsborough and Christine Sims endorsed Charles' 
findings, they said, partly because of declarations made by several employees. 
Those declarations, which remain confidential, "speak much more clearly than 
the report itself" to problems of favoritism in the Child Support Division, 
Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners rejected the argument of Assistant County Counsel Noel Klebaum, 
who represented Bradbury at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Klebaum argued that there was no basis for the commission to find a violation 
of county nepotism rules, partly because Bradbury changed the department's 
organizational structure last November, shortly after the Troms were married. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Escobar Trom has reported directly to Assistant Dist. Atty. C. Toy 
White, who evaluates her performance, instead of to her former superior in the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar Trom still performs the same duties and works in the same office just 
down the hall from her husband, but she no longer works for her husband either 
directly or indirectly, Klebaum said. 
</P>
<P>
Klebaum told the commission that it could not conclude that work rules have 
been violated unless it first concludes that "the district attorney's 
reorganization is nothing but a sham." 
</P>
<P>
The county counsel described Trom and his wife as two loyal and valuable county 
employees, each with a tenure of about 20 years, who have been "unfairly 
subjected to public criticism and embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that Mr. Trom has ever showed favoritism to Mrs. Trom," 
he said.

SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SEEK SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Union High School District voted unanimously Wednesday to pay 
$12,000 to a statewide organization of school boards to search for a new 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent will replace Dr. Bob Carter, who leaves July 1 after 
serving 10 years as chief of the 11,000-student OUHSD system. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has been hired as superintendent of the Santa Clara Unified School 
District in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the trustees said they hope to hire a new superintendent by the end of 
June, Richard Montgomery, assistant executive director of the California School 
Board Assn., cautioned members that it may take four months or more to complete 
the search. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in no major rush to fill the superintendent's position because we want 
to do whatever it takes to find the right person. Still, we would like someone 
to be in place before Dr. Carter leaves, or at least by the end of the summer 
before school starts," Trustee Bedford Pinkard said. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery will conduct the search by preparing a pamphlet describing the 
district to potential applicants and placing advertisements in national trade 
journals. He also plans to meet with school officials, teachers, parents and 
students to discuss the district's needs. CAROLYN KUSKY

CHULA VISTA NATURE CENTER CHIEF ADMITS SHOOTING 2 DOVES, RABBITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of Chula Vista's nature center admitted Wednesday that he shot and 
killed two doves in the center's gallery, and that seven rabbits on the 
center's grounds were "collected" using the same BB gun. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Neudecker of the Chula Vista Nature Interpretive Center said at a 
press conference that he used the BB gun, purchased with city funds in 1987, to 
shoot and kill mourning doves that on two separate occasions had flown into the 
center's gallery and could not be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a prepared statement, Neudecker said the gun was purchased in the 
fall of 1987, "two days after a mourning dove flew into the center and perched 
on the high rafters of the galleria." 
</P>
<P>
"Its droppings were threatening our aquaria animals and damaging our exhibits," 
Neudecker said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, another mourning dove entered the center's showroom and was 
killed, Neudecker said. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning doves are protected by the Migratory Bird and Treaty Act. 
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal to take or shoot any migratory bird," said Diane Petrula, 
special agent of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's law enforcement division. 
"The act applies anywhere in the United States and applies to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Shooting protected birds is a misdemeanor under federal law and carries a 
maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker, the center's executive director, came under fire two weeks ago when 
a letter signed by two former employees of the center alleged that he had shot 
at animals both in the center and in the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife 
Refuge, which contains the center. The letter, which Neudecker provided 
Wednesday, charges him with using the compound as "his own private shooting 
gallery." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Neudecker said he now understands that "this was 
inappropriate," calling the incidents "an error in judgment," and he apologized 
for any embarrassment that he may have caused the center. In the future, when a 
bird becomes trapped in the center, Neudecker said, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service will be called to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker, however, denied allegations made in the letter that he shot at 
animals from his office window or in the Sweetwater Marsh refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker also denied charges that he had used a rifle to rid the marsh of 
squirrels and wild cats. He said that he keeps a .22-caliber rifle in his 
office, but that it has not been fired. The rifle was to be used to dispose of 
wild cats if they became trapped on the compound, Neudecker said. 
</P>
<P>
The center is in the Sweetwater Marsh Wildlife Refuge and is part of the 
316-acre wildlife preserve, all of which is federal property regulated by the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The city has a fenced easement of 3.4 acres 
constituting the center. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, what he did is not much different than if he had done it out in 
the marsh," Assistant City Manager Gene Asmus said. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker, who refused to answer questions after reading his three-page 
statement, also admitted to having "collected" about seven rabbits in "an 
attempt to protect the native vegetation and to feed our captive birds." 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker said the rabbits were used to feed the center's three captive birds, 
a red-tailed hawk, a kestrel (European falcon) and a burrowing owl. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker said only one rabbit was shot after the Sweetwater Marsh refuge was 
established in August, 1988, and that "it is a common practice of game 
management in national and state parks and on refuges to control populations . 
. . and to cull herds of herbivores which grow abnormally large and threaten 
the existence of vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
But Asmus said shooting the rabbits was "poor judgment" on Neudecker's part 
because, "He could have shot them 24 hours a day for a year and never gotten 
rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Hunting is not allowed on the refuges we have here in San Diego County in 
general, regardless of who is involved," said Marc Weitzel of U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife. "The rabbits are part of the ecosystem out there. They are a natural 
resource." 
</P>
<P>
Asmus said that the city's investigation into the allegations could be complete 
by the end of this week. The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a separate 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker reports to City Manager John Goss, who will take any disciplinary 
action deemed necessary. Asmus said the possible discipline, which could range 
from a verbal reprimand to dismissal, will not be decided until the Bayfront 
Conservancy Trust, overseers of the center's operations, meets April 24.

$1.15 MILLION SOUGHT TO IMPROVE HOUSING 
</P>

<P>
The Oxnard City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to apply for two U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development grants totaling almost $1.15 
million to rehabilitate low- and moderate-income housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to apply for a $72,000 HUD grant to help rehabilitate 66 
moderate-income apartments in the city, said Ernest Whitaker, Oxnard housing 
rehabilitation program manager. 
</P>
<P>
Although it will take HUD about 30 days to formally approve the application, 
Whitaker said, he is almost certain the grant will be given. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a case of us going on a fishing expedition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, apartment owners can qualify for funds if their buildings 
are in moderate-income neighborhoods and if 70% of the units are leased to 
residents with moderate incomes, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
A resident who earns 80% or less of the city's median household income, or 
about $25,000 annually, is defined as having a moderate income. A resident who 
earns 50% or less of the median income, or about $15,600 annually, is defined 
as having a low income. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD money can be provided as a loan with 6% interest or as a grant to 
apartment owners who can provide matching funds of 50%, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting as the Oxnard Housing Authority Commission, also voted to 
apply for a $1,073,290 HUD grant for capital improvement projects at 100 
low-income housing units in six housing projects owned and operated by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials expect the grant to be approved by August, a report by city 
staff members says. 
</P>
<P>
The grant would be used to replace stoves, water heaters and worn kitchen 
cabinets, among other things, the report says. The money would also pay to 
install bulletproof windows and remove gasoline-contaminated soil at the 
maintenance and administrative offices for the Department of Housing at 300 N.

SCHOOL BOARD OKS $3.2-MILLION PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
The Fillmore Unified School District has approved spending $3.2 million to 
build a gymnasium and outdoor covered patio on a site originally intended for a 
junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
Last November voters defeated an $8-million bond measure sponsored by the 
district that would have provided funding for construction of the school at A 
and 3rd streets in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Supt. Marlene Davis said that although the district needs a new school, 
not just the facilities approved Tuesday, its hands are tied because of the 
failed bond measure and the improbability of getting state funding. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we have $3.2 million and what we said to the architect 
is, 'What can we build for $3.2 million?' " Davis said. "What we can build is a 
gymnasium and a pavilion, and that is all." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Tom Spitler, the only one on the five-member board to vote against 
spending the money, said he questions "whether we can really get much 
educational value for a gymnasium and a locker room." Spitler said he would 
rather hold on to the money until the school district could afford to build 
"more educationally oriented facilities." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said that building a school would cost $10 million and that voters 
are unlikely to approve another bond measure necessary to finance it, given the 
defeat of the proposed bond in November. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore Junior High School Principal Mario Contini said the gym and patio, 
which will be built on a part of the land at A and 3rd streets, will relieve 
crowding at the school. Contini said his school uses Fillmore High School's 
cafeteria, library, gymnasium and other facilities. JOEL BRAND

AIR SHOW OKD FOR VAN NUYS, WITH CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles airport commissioners on Wednesday authorized an air show for Van 
Nuys Airport this summer after imposing conditions aimed at satisfying 
homeowner complaints about airplane noise and illegal automobile parking at two 
previous shows. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day free exposition, which last year drew 210,000 people, making it the 
largest public event in the San Fernando Valley, will be Saturday and Sunday, 
July 21-22. 
</P>
<P>
It will be held at the Air National Guard site on Balboa Boulevard, south of 
Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Airport staff officials say they have not yet secured commitments from 
exhibitors but hope to have a B-1B and a B-52 bomber, F-16 fighters and other 
front-line military craft, as well as historic military and civilian planes. 
</P>
<P>
But because of conditions imposed Wednesday by the Board of Airport 
Commissioners, none of the planes at Aviation Expo '90 will be permitted to 
conduct flying exhibitions over the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Also, exhibitors will be pressured to arrive during normal business hours the 
day before the show and leave after 8 a.m. on Monday after the show, said 
Charles Zeman, Van Nuys Airport manager. Airport officials have acknowledged 
that they were peppered with complaints last year about noise from the flying 
demonstrations and from exhibitors taking off from the airport early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner group leaders also accused airport officials of turning off the 
system that automatically records telephoned noise complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Zeman said the system was not turned off but was "overloaded, at least partly 
because people were using the complaint line to find out about the show so they 
could attend." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also directed the staff to open remote parking lots and charter 
buses to shuttle people to and from the show to lessen the glut of parking in 
nearby residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kanon Alpert, chairman of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council, 
endorsed the air show with the conditions attached by the commission, saying 
the event was of "great benefit to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Don Schultz, president of Ban Airport Noise, a group that frequently 
criticizes the airport as too noisy, said that with the commission's 
conditions, "I think it's an event we can live with and support." 
</P>
<P>
But Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, opposed the 
commission's action, saying that "static air shows are far from quiet. They 
draw thousands of visitors, increase auto traffic and create congestion for 
miles around."

LAWMAKERS ASKED TO RESTORE OK ON PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICAS: BUILDERS HOPE TO REVIVE A CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT. BUT LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SEE THE ATTEMPT AS A CIRCUMVENTION OF THE PLANNING PROCESS. 
</P>

<P>
Developers of a controversial housing tract in the Santa Monica Mountains are 
trying to persuade the state Legislature to restore planning approval for the 
second time on a project that the city of Los Angeles claims expired three 
years ago, their lobbyist acknowledged this week. 
</P>
<P>
No measures have been formally introduced, but the developers of the 1,500-acre 
site near Mandeville and Mission canyons have spoken to several lawmakers about 
carrying special-interest legislation on their behalf, said their lobbyist, Les 
Cohen. The developers, Eastport Associates, want the Legislature to restore a 
tentative 500-home tract map the city says expired in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the effort elicited anger from state and local officials, who 
said they resented what they characterized as an attempt to circumvent the 
local planning process. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it outrageous and will do everything possible to block it," said 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Tarzana), whose district includes the site. 
</P>
<P>
"If this can be done," said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, "then there is no project -- however outrageous 
-- that has been turned down or died of its own weight that cannot be revived." 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has been working to preserve and eventually obtain nearby 
Mission Canyon from Los Angeles County. Development of the Eastport site would 
jeopardize those plans, because Mission Canyon has been proposed for a required 
access road. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), whose district also includes the site, 
said he, too, will oppose the plan. Rosenthal said developer W. Charles 
Chastain, who is involved with the project, told him: "I'm not going to walk 
away from it, there is too much invested." 
</P>
<P>
The property lies west of the San Diego Freeway and south of Mulholland Drive, 
in a mountainside area with views of West Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean. 
Eastport is attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Renewal of the tract map is considered crucial. Without it, whoever attempts to 
build on the site would have to start the approval process over and contend 
with hillside construction laws and homeowners groups that did not exist when 
the tract map was initially granted in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The city says its approval expired in 1987, after Eastport had received several 
extensions. Developers then took their case to the Legislature and succeeded in 
obtaining a measure, enacted in 1988, designed to retroactively extend the life 
of the firm's tract map. 
</P>
<P>
The city later challenged the validity of the legislation and last month a 
federal judge ruled that Eastport's measure could not revive building rights 
that had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Eastport have indicated that they will appeal the ruling. In the 
meantime, Eastport wants the Legislature to clarify its intent, said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
The original measure was sponsored by former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya 
(D-Whittier), who has since become the first California legislator in 35 years 
to be found guilty of corruption in office. His conviction last February did 
not involve the Eastport legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But his sponsorship was noted by several angry officials. "Considering how this 
occurred the first time, through a devious, secret measure by convicted felon 
Sen. Montoya, I think there's going to be much closer scrutiny of any such 
efforts," said Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) said Eastport has asked him to 
sponsor a new amendment and attach it to an inactive bill he introduced last 
year. The Costa bill, AB-1661, was written to preserve building permits issued 
before voters enact slow-growth measures. 
</P>
<P>
But Costa has not yet studied the proposed amendment and no decision has been 
made, said his senior consultant Terry Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
Chastain and Eastport Associates' general partner, Donald H. Albrecht, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chastain, who built the high-priced Palisades Highlands tract in Pacific 
Palisades, was brought into the Eastport project by another developer, Ray A. 
Watt, because of his success in building in the Santa Monica Mountains, 
according to Cindy Miscikowski, administrative aide to Westside Councilman 
Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we would oppose any bill that would revive and attempt to resuscitate 
zoning that had expired. . . . It's kaput and has no validity," Miscikowski 
said. "If someone wants to reapply and start over under city processes, that is 
available. I don't see how anyone could reach back and revive something this 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
Watt, one of the state's most powerful and politically influential developers, 
last summer offered $69 million for the troubled Eastport project. But in 
recent months Watt allowed his option on Eastport to expire, and he said again 
this week that he is no longer interested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Watt also denied speculation by Miscikowski and others that he was only 
assuming a lower profile in the Eastport project and that Chastain was really 
working on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Cohen acknowledged business ties between himself and Watt, and between 
Watt and Chastain. But he, too, said Watt had withdrawn from the Eastport 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Chastain also has experience with special-interest legislation. His firm, 
Headland Properties Inc., tried several times in 1979 to have the Legislature 
exempt Palisades Highlands from Coastal Commission control. In 1985, Chastain 
again appealed to the Legislature for help in changing the location of 100 
moderately priced homes he had promised to build, from the entrance of the 
wealthy Highlands to a more commercial site in West Los Angeles. Both efforts 
failed.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: GOP TARGETED ON THE ENVIORNMENT 
</P>

<P>
Congressional Democrats will air television advertisements in Republican Rep. 
Robert J Lagomarsino's district through "Earth Day" weekend to portray 
Republicans as weak on protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two cable ads in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties depicts workers 
cleaning up oil spilled from the Exxon tanker Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Valdez went on the rocks, Republicans took a wait-and-see attitude. . 
.," a narrator says. "But while the Republicans waited, the Democrats went to 
work demanding the federal government take over the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats have been coming to the rescue for years because we can't afford 
to wait," the narrator says. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which produced the ads, 
considers Lagomarsino vulnerable in November's election because he barely 
survived a challenge in 1988 from state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
Environmental safeguards became a major election theme after Environmental 
Action, an advocacy group, placed Lagomarsino on its "dirty dozen" list of 
congressmen most likely to harm the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Carter, a top aide to Lagomarsino, said his boss is aware of the ad 
campaign but unconcerned about its impact. "The ads don't point out Lagomarsino 
by name because he is strong on these issues," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously not a direct hit," he said. "The ad talks about the Exxon 
Valdez and this is the congressman who has rerouted all of the tankers outside 
of the Channel Islands." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Rodriguez, campaign manager for Democratic challenger Anita Perez-Ferguson 
of Santa Barbara, agrees that the ads are not a direct attack on Lagomarsino. 
But he said they will reinforce the message that the environment is a 
Democratic issue. 
</P>
<P>
"You can pick out only a few Republicans with a decent environmental records 
and Lagomarsino is not one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino's district is one of seven congressional districts nationwide 
targeted by the ad campaign. The ads will be aired Wednesday through Sunday.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
</P>
<P>
WORKERS APPREHEND 2 BURGLARY SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two construction workers in Thousand Oaks captured two teen-agers Wednesday 
allegedly in the act of burglarizing a single-family home and trapped them in a 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Derian Drickerson, 23, and Rafael Ariztia, 25, came to the rescue of Carolina 
Kosashi after she ran from her house on the 600 block of Triunfo Canyon Road at 
11:30 a.m. screaming about burglars, said Lt. Kelli McIlvain of the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Kosashi had arrived home and heard voices in the house, McIlvain said. 
</P>
<P>
Drickerson and Ariztia, both of the Newbury Park area of Thousand Oaks, entered 
Kosashi's house and caught two of three suspects upstairs, McIlvain said. A 
third suspect fled the house, which had been ransacked, he said. Possessions 
had been stacked, McIlvain said. 
</P>
<P>
Drickerson and Ariztia held the two suspects -- a male and a female, both of 
Northridge -- in the bathroom until officers arrived and arrested them, 
McIlvain said. 
</P>
<P>
Drickerson and Ariztia also were able to describe the car of the third suspect. 
Police arrested Friedrick Widjajawiguna, 18, of Northridge on suspicion of 
burglary moments later. He was carrying a few possessions believed to be from 
the Kosashi house, McIlvain said.

CONDITIONS PUT ON DEVELOPMENT OF MARINELAND SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes council members Tuesday night voted 3 to 2 to require the 
Monaghan Co. to set aside land for open space if any oceanfront homes are built 
on the former Marineland site. Over the objections of the developer, the 
council also limited the number of homes that could be built. 
</P>
<P>
The council did not approve any development plans but agreed to allow the 
company to seek a zoning change that would allow residential construction on 
the 102-acre site, which is currently designated for commercial and 
recreational use. A hotel and golf course are also planned for the property. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council said no more than 45 homes on one-acre lots could be 
constructed. And the Arizona-based developer must replace any open space lost 
to the project with a comparable amount of open space elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not specifically spelled out by the city on its list of 
conditions, that land would presumably come from 312 acres Monaghan owns in an 
area of the city known as the Filiorum. The area is named after a company that 
once owned the land. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan had wanted to build 65 homes on the Marineland site and offered to 
give the city 100 acres of unspecified land in the Filiorum area to preserve as 
open space in return. The company has argued that a smaller number of homes 
would make the entire project economically unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff asked us to come in with our bottom line, and we did," company 
spokeswoman Joan Hanley said Wednesday. "We are looking at our options." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's council action was required under state law because the proposed 
zoning change would alter the city's General Plan. Even if the City Council 
eventually approves a zone change, Monaghan would also need state Coastal 
Commission approval to build homes on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have previously opposed building any homes on the property 
because of its present zoning. The city is also concerned that building homes 
on the site would restrict public access to the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the City Council's responsibility to enhance Mr. (James) 
Monaghan's net worth at the expense of the community," Councilman Douglas 
Hinchliffe said during the public hearing that preceded the council's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Councilman Robert E. Ryan said the open space requirements 
represent a good compromise for both sides, even though he still opposes 
building any homes on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan "bought that land knowing the rules and now he is crying about it," 
Ryan said. "Well, if it is unacceptable to him, he can sell out or do something 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Mel Hughes and Councilman John McTaggart voted against allowing Monaghan 
to seek the zone change. Both said they felt the city's guidelines left too 
many questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan purchased the property in May, 1987, 90 days after the landmark 
aquatic park was closed. The company originally said it wanted to construct a 
1,070-room hotel on the land, a proposal that met with resistance by some 
residents, who feared such a large hotel would create traffic and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
However, last December the company informed city officials it was willing to 
scale back the proposed hotel to 495 rooms if it were allowed to build homes. 
</P>
<P>
Hanley said that in addition to the 100 acres, the company was also willing to 
give up its rights to build any residences in the entire Filiorum area, 
although it does want to build a private country club and golf course there. 
</P>
<P>
All but about 25 of the 315 acres Monaghan owns in the area is situated in a 
building moratorium zone because of past landslides in the general area. Under 
the guidelines imposed on the company, any land it might give the city in 
exchange for building oceanfront homes must be outside the moratorium area.

40 PROTEST CSUN LEADER'S REFUSAL TO BAN ROTC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

About 40 students and faculty members blocked the main entrance of the Cal 
State Northridge administration building for more than two hours Wednesday, 
protesting the university president's decision to retain the ROTC program after 
faculty members voted to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
Chanting "ROTC go away. Racist, sexist, anti-gay," the demonstrators wore CSUN 
sweat shirts stenciled with the word "discriminates" in Day-Glo orange and 
carried banners that read, "Where is democracy at CSUN?" and "When some are 
oppressed, none are free." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN faculty members last month voted to abolish the Reserve Officers' Training 
Corps program, in which 42 students are enrolled, because of the U.S. Defense 
Department's exclusion of those who are openly homosexual from military 
service. But that recommendation was overturned Monday by CSUN President James 
W. Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators argued that CSUN would not tolerate a program that discriminated 
against women or minorities, so it should not allow one that discriminates 
against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Discrimination is the same whether it's blacks, Latinos, women or 
homosexuals," said Zeke Zeidler, a 1987 CSUN graduate and former student body 
president. "The only difference is homophobia is acceptable in our society." 
</P>
<P>
The students, many of whom are members of the Lesbian and Gay Alliance, 
demanded that Cleary reconsider. But Cleary, who was at an off-campus meeting 
Wednesday morning, said by telephone that his decision was circumscribed by a 
legal opinion from an attorney for the California State University system. That 
opinion found, in part, that states do not have the right to overrule federal 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's virtually impossible in my position to change a decision based on legal 
advice from the legal counsel for the entire system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the statewide Academic Senate is scheduled to vote on gutting ROTC 
programs at all CSU campuses during its May 3-4 meeting in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation up for review avoids the legal challenges of trying to ban 
ROTC by instead calling for removal of any mention of ROTC programs from 
college catalogues and other campus publications, refusal of credit for 
ROTC-related courses and denial of faculty status for ROTC instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Geigle, senate chairman, said that "the practical effect would be to 
eliminate ROTC on the campuses." Recommendations from the Academic Senate are 
usually routinely approved by the CSU Board of Trustees, Geigle said. 
</P>
<P>
At a rally after Wednesday's protest, Jon Davidson, an attorney for the 
American Civil Liberties Union told students that he is examining past 
decisions regarding states' rights and may file a lawsuit against Cleary and 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
"President Cleary's arguments are nothing but excuses," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's turnout was meager compared to anti-Vietnam War marches at 
the university in the '60s and '70s, observers said it was one of the largest 
protests in recent campus history. 
</P>
<P>
"Students aren't used to demonstrating," Prof. John Clendenning said. "Twenty 
years ago, there would've been a massive demonstration." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators gained access to their offices by using back and side doors. But 
one protest organizer, senior Mat Rudieck, 24, said the intent was not to 
prevent people from getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our point is to make it inconvenient for people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the rally, Rudieck and other students discussed plans to continue the 
protest today, possibly in a speech to the faculty senate.

PEOPLE: BADMINTON CHAMP IS TOUGH BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Borge Frederiksen has been playing badminton since he was 14 years old and now, 
at age 70, believes he's a decent competitor. 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
In January he won the U.S. International Championship for Seniors in singles, 
men's doubles and mixed doubles in his age group. The tournament was held in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In March the five-year Laguna Hills Leisure World resident won the top prize in 
singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles in his age group at the United States 
Senior National Championship in Midwest City, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"I have won everything I have played in this year," he said matter-of-factly. 
He intended to compete in Canada this month but canceled due to work problems. 
"I work a little from time to time," said Frederiksen, a retired president of 
an insurance company in Copenhagen, where he was born and raised. 
</P>
<P>
However, his premiere competition occurred in 1948 when he won the All-England 
Badminton Championship in London. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time it was considered the world championship," said the soft-spoken 
Frederiksen. 
</P>
<P>
"That had to be my finest hour," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Pressures of business had kept Frederiksen off the court for years until he 
retired eight years ago and "four years back I wanted to prove to myself that I 
still hit the bird with authority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So Frederiksen started playing badminton three days a week to sharpen his 
technique, and played golf, walked a treadmill and used a rowing machine to get 
himself in condition for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"The game itself is very strenuous and in fact is one of the most strenuous 
sports in the world," he said. "Most people in America think of it as a casual 
outdoor game." 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't be more wrong, said Frederiksen, who spends one of his practice 
days at the five-court Manhattan Beach Badminton Club where "the good players 
are." 
</P>
<P>
He competes and practices there with players in the 50 to 55 age bracket "who 
can give me a really good practice session." Other days he plays at the 
badminton court at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is somewhat like tennis, although badminton is a tougher and faster 
sport because there is very little rest time in between points. It is a very, 
very fast game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking about badminton is changing somewhat and because of that some 
Americans have become top-level badminton players." 
</P>
<P>
Players who become proficient at badminton see the complexities of the sport as 
their experience grows, Frederiksen said. 
</P>
<P>
"They see how really fast it is and the things that can be done during a game," 
he continued. "The really good players in the world are between the ages of 20 
and 30 so there is plenty of room for young Americans to compete." 
</P>
<P>
The toughest competition comes from from such countries as China, Indonesia, 
Sweden, Denmark and England. "China is the tough nation for the time being," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take time for America to catch up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster resident and Orange Coast College student Anneke Sherohman traveled 
to Singapore to compete in the 20th International Salon Culinarire, and it was 
a winning trip. 
</P>
<P>
She collected a silver medal in a culinary arts competition that drew students 
and professionals from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible creation," said Barbara Cooper, director of the Orange 
Coast College culinary arts program, who accompanied Sherohman. 
</P>
<P>
Sherohman's silver medal came in the centerpiece category for a five-piece 
Oriental depiction of the four seasons fashioned out of powdered sugar, corn 
syrup, glucose and water. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an unbelievably talented artist," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- For the fourth consecutive year, the Key Club of Canyon High 
School in Anaheim won first place in overall achievement at the 44th Annual 
Convention of Key Clubs in California, Nevada and Hawaii held in Anaheim. 
Representatives were Craig Dart, president, Rob Sunderland, Jimmy Lee, Mike Le, 
Matt Webber, Danny Uyematsu, Jeff Ellis and Brian Jalowiec.

GALLEGLY ACCUSED OF LOBBYING FOR DEVELOPER; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE GOP CONGRESSMAN DENIES HIS CHALLENGER'S ALLEGATIONS THAT HE HAS 
TAKEN A STAND ON A CONTROVERSIAL LAND SWAP PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional candidate Sang Korman has accused Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) of lobbying on behalf of a developer who proposed a controversial land 
swap that would allow construction of 1,152 homes and a tournament golf course 
in Gallegly's district. 
</P>
<P>
But Gallegly responded that he has taken no position on the proposed deal and 
added that it is "far too important to make it a political football." 
</P>
<P>
Korman is seeking the Republican nomination in the June 5 primary election 
against Gallegly, who represents the 21st Congressional District, which 
straddles Ventura and northern Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he opposes the proposed swap, under which Potomac Investment 
Associates would trade 864 acres of the Jordan Ranch in Ventura County for 59 
acres in lower Cheeseboro Canyon owned by the National Park Service. Potomac 
would also sell the scenic China Flat portion of the ranch to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Maryland-based development firm needs the federal acreage to build a road 
to the ranch property, which would enable the land to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly's stand on the deal is significant because he sits on the House 
Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and its national parks and public lands 
subcommittee, which oversee the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Gallegly has received a total of $4,300 from Potomac, law firms 
involved in the development and the PGA Tour, which would operate the golf 
course, according to federal campaign records. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Gallegly and Rep. Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who also sits on the 
interior committee, sent a letter to Park Service chief James Ridenour urging 
an expeditious ruling on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Korman charged in a press release that the proposed swap "has Mr. Gallegly's 
fingerprints written all over it" and that the developer's contributions were 
intended to "grease the wheels" for approval of the deal with federal 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But Gallegly said he has taken no position on the swap and is waiting for local 
planning officials to rule on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"You will find no place anywhere that I lobbied for this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he asked the Park Service to make a quick decision because if the 
deal falls apart after months or years of discussions, the value of the China 
Flat acreage may have risen so high that the government would not be able to 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman also said he has "serious questions" about the development, 
including whether it may disrupt a wildlife migration corridor in the area.

LASORDA TO BE RAZZED WITH BERRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda has upset the Oxnard Convention and 
Visitors Bureau so much that it is, well, sending him a flat of strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Lasorda asked a reporter from an Oxnard newspaper recently: 
"Oxnard, where the hell is that?" 
</P>
<P>
The visitors bureau is not going to take a comment such as that lying down. "We 
are planning on shipping him a flat of strawberries," said Robert Varley, 
bureau executive director. 
</P>
<P>
It's not much of a reprisal for making fun of the city, but Varley said that, 
if nothing else, the strawberries will make Lasorda remember the comment. 
</P>
<P>
"And, since he's on a diet, maybe we should send him a strawberry shortcake," 
Varley said.

26 SEA LION BODIES FOUND ALONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bodies of 26 sea lions and one seal, most of them decomposed, washed ashore 
over the weekend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Aleta Hohn, a biologist with the La Jolla National Marine Fisheries 
Service, which does research on the status of marine mammals, said the animals 
were found on Navy and state property on Coronado beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the animals looked like they had been shot, but, after a necropsy was 
done on four of the animals, no bullet holes were found," Hohn said. "Birds 
sometimes peck at the animals, and the peck holes look like bullet holes." 
</P>
<P>
The federal organization had received reports Monday that some of the animals 
had been shot, Hohn said, adding that most of the animals may have become 
entangled in gill nets and died at sea before floating ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 80,000 sea lions off California, 4,000 are shot to death each year by 
commercial fishermen.

THE NECESSITY OF RELIGION; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH COURT SAYS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS A LUXURY -- WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to strip religious believers whose 
practices violate certain general laws of the constitutional protection they 
now enjoy is more than a sweeping repudiation of nearly a century of humane and 
enlightened legal precedent. It is an affront both to our society's hard-won 
pluralism and to the belief in limited government that distinguishes principled 
conservatism from mere reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The case at issue -- Employment Division, State of Oregon vs. Smith -- involved 
two Indians, members of the Native American Church, who were dismissed from 
their jobs as drug counselors in a state program after they admitted eating 
peyote during a religious ceremony. The court upheld the dismissal. But rather 
than stopping there, the author of the majority opinion, Justice Antonin 
Scalia, set down a new standard for application of the First Amendment to 
conflicts between religious practice and general laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a line of decisions dating back to the First World War, the court had held 
that when such conflicts occur, the individual's right to religious freedom 
must prevail unless the state asserts an even more "compelling interest," such 
as enforcement of health and safety laws on religious schools. On Tuesday, the 
court set that standard aside and ruled that general laws will be presumed 
valid even if they seriously infringe on the exercise of religious freedom. 
Only those statutes intended to repress a particular creed, the court held, are 
prohibited by the First Amendment. The United States, Justice Scalia wrote, 
"cannot afford the luxury" of setting laws aside simply because they restrict 
religious practices. This new standard, he wrote, "will place at a relative 
disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that 
unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system 
in which each conscience is law." 
</P>
<P>
The Founders, of course, envisioned no such system but one in which the law 
made room for the expression of individual conscience, and in which the ability 
of the democratic majority to tyrannize the minority was restrained by an 
inviolable Bill of Rights, the first of which was freedom of religion. Through 
much of our history, much of that charter has remained an ideal rather than a 
reality, particularly when it comes to the free exercise of religion. Scalia 
himself is the product of a parochial educational system created because 
19th-Century public schools subjected the children of Catholic immigrants to 
instruction in the majority's Protestant religion. The largely successful 
struggle to make liberty of conscience a functional reality rather than a 
constitutional ideal is one of the glories of 20th-Century America. 
</P>
<P>
The court's decision to turn its back on such an achievement at precisely the 
moment that this nation is attempting to come to terms with unprecedented 
ethnic and religious diversity is pure legal adventurism.

GRAFFITI SQUAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was sad to read of the frustration of the so-called Ghost squad of RTD 
police who diligently work to apprehend the vandals responsible for making a 
visual mess of so much of Los Angeles (Metro, March 26). Despite some 808 
arrests, they see the culprits get off with small fines that have little 
deterrent value. 
</P>
<P>
The solution seems obvious: Why not put the little dears to work removing 
graffiti once they are caught? A few days with their artistic hands immersed in 
paint remover while their friends look on might just serve to dull their 
creative impulses, to say nothing of the dent it would put in the reported $10 
million annual expense for cleaning up the mess. Surely there is nothing novel 
in a sentence of community service. Why aren't we doing it?

CONVICTION OF JOHN POINDEXTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fein contends that Poindexter's conviction has "worrisome implications for a 
strong executive branch." 
</P>
<P>
I think Poindexter's conviction should be cause for concern to all members of 
the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
It should serve as a reminder to politicians that they need to conduct 
themselves with both conscience and respect for the law. 
</P>
<P>
Fein feels that the executive branch needs to have the freedom to operate 
outside of the law. He says that there is a whole underworld that merits 
"secrecy." I'm sure this is true, but secrecy does not have to include illegal 
activity and lies to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Fein further feels that Poindexter's "patriotic," "official misjudgments" and 
"overzealousness" should be overlooked. Apparently Fein does not recognize the 
violation that Poindexter's (and Oliver North's) actions effect on the moral 
and ideological fabric of this nation. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several years many of us have felt left out of the mainstream of 
American life. We have felt frustration in always seemingly being part of the 
problem, and hardly ever part of the solution. We have been left with the 
impression that the concern of government officials has been self-serving and 
that somehow they have been above the law. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction of Poindexter has given us a renewed faith in our system of 
justice and in our ability to right past wrongs by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
This should send out a very clear signal to all politicians, both at the 
national and local level, that arrogant misuse of power and position will not 
be tolerated by the American people. It is a strong signal to the rest of us 
that equality under the law is a hallmark of our system.

CONVICTION OF JOHN POINDEXTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading Bruce Fein's "A Verdict With Harm to Spare" (Op-Ed Page, April 9) I 
waited for the two standard defenses for the criminal actions of John M. 
Poindexter, former national security adviser. That he was only doing it for 
patriotic reasons and the security of the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
What these patriots don't seem to realize is that every time they claim 
national security as a reason to cloak unpopular operations from U.S. citizens 
(does anyone believe the Soviets had no idea what the CIA was doing) they lose 
the trust of the people. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem to bother Fein that the tactics used by Poindexter and his 
operatives appear more like those we accuse the Soviets and Cubans of using. 
Instead he tries to call the whole thing politically motivated, ignoring the 
fact that Ronald Reagan's own attorney general started the investigation into 
possible violations of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of admitting that there was no general support in the American public 
for a dirty war in Nicaragua, he blames Congress for doing its lawful job, that 
of allocating funds and authority to spend those funds. He seems to think that 
the executive branch has the right to raise funds on its own authority when 
Congress doesn't approve.

THAT WONDERFUL BIG MAC ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonald's Corp., which plans to spend $400 million this year to build or 
remodel about 1,400 restaurants, says that fully $100 million of that sum will 
be used to buy recycled products. McDonald's promises that this big jump in its 
support for recycling -- it now spends $60 million a year on recycled paper 
goods -- will continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Given a big enough market, recycled products are often cheaper than virgin 
materials; in time, then, McDonald's profits ought to be boosted. That 
consideration in no way detracts from the social value of what the fast-food 
chain is doing. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, facing rising energy costs to produce what eventually becomes their 
trash and rapidly running out of places to dispose of it, have a compelling 
need to move toward large-scale recycling. McDonald's serves about 22 million 
customers a day, making it not just a major purveyor of food but a big 
generator of trash. Along with other large companies, it should take the lead 
to create markets that would encourage greater conversion of waste into 
reusable products. McDonald's intends to give preference to materials using 
recycled plastic, among them ceiling and floor tiles, insulation, roofing, 
table tops, trash cans and playground equipment. Manufacturers and distributors 
of these and other recycled products are invited to contact McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is especially important for plastics, which now make up about 7% of 
U.S. solid waste by weight. That volume, the Environmental Protection Agency 
warns, will likely double in just 10 years. New technologies are making some 
plastics recycling feasible. Those technologies, combined with new markets of 
the kind McDonald's responsibly intends to foster, are vital for dealing with 
the nation's burgeoning solid-waste problem.

LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While I commend The Times for recognizing the vitality of grass-roots efforts 
in my hometown ("The Spirit of Los Alamitos," editorial, April 10), I feel 
compelled to mention some important aspects about Measure K, which continue to 
be downplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial glosses over the purely political decision by bond supporters to 
exempt property owners 65 years or older from the $4.50-a-month tax. 
</P>
<P>
The flawed rationale for the exemption, allowable under California state law, 
is that senior citizens will not derive benefits from well-maintained schools. 
</P>
<P>
However, elderly citizens within the boundaries of the Los Alamitos Unified 
School District, among the most affluent and able to pay for such a tax in 
Orange County, will certainly derive more attractive property values from a 
town with relatively respectable educational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad commentary that bond supporters, in order to ensure political 
survival, omitted a whole class of citizens unlikely to give back to the 
community. From this perspective it appears that one generation is being pitted 
against another; and I would not advise that for any community interested in 
following Los Alamitos' grass-roots activism.

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spraying of malathion, whether necessary or not, is a continuing hardship 
to millions of Southern California residents. The confinement to our houses, 
the ruining of our organic gardens, the unremunerated costs of tarpaulins and 
car washings are only a few of the trials supposedly inconsiderately placed 
upon us all by the governor and his agricultural specialists. 
</P>
<P>
We are to take solace in the fact that we are sacrificing for the future of 
California agriculture; this is all well and good, but we would like to know 
that California agriculture appreciates our sacrifices in turn. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest a once only drastic cut in fruit prices in our area. It should last 
the entire summer and be confined to Los Angeles and Orange counties. This 
would certainly prove to us all that California agribusiness sympathizes with 
our plight.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are searching for a man posing as a Federal Express employee who has 
tricked several San Diego businesses out of hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said that, since Feb. 1, police have received 
about 25 calls from small businesses that have paid the man $18.50 per 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The thief, wearing either a brown or blue Federal Express uniform bearing the 
company's emblem, delivers envelopes stuffed with blank Internal Revenue 
Service forms. He also leaves receipts with return addresses from nonexistent 
state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Wednesday, the thief entered a barber shop in the 6100 block of 
University Avenue with a delivery from the state Board of Barbers, Robinson 
said. When the shop's employee became suspicious and refused to pay, the thief 
told him he had other deliveries to make and would return later. 
</P>
<P>
The man is described as white, in his 40s, about 6-foot-3 and weighing 160 to 
170 pounds. He had brown, collar-length hair and was wearing clear, wire-rimmed 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said similar operations have been reported in Sacramento, Fresno, 
Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the scam should call police at 696-1655.

MAN, 34, KILLED IN CRASH ON RIVERSIDE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old Torrance man died Tuesday after his car rammed into a 
tractor-trailer on the Riverside Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel M. Chang died at the scene shortly after the crash about 2 a.m. in the 
eastbound lanes just west of the Knott Avenue exit. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Angel Johnson said Chang was driving a red 1985 Datsun 300ZX "at a 
high rate of speed" and had decided to change lanes when he rear ended the 
tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said both the driver of the tractor-trailer and his passenger 
complained of minor back pain, but did not require hospitalization.

OBJECT IN ROADWAY CAUSES FATAL FREEWAY COLLISION 
</P>

<P>
Two people were killed and two others were critically injured when a car 
collided with a truck on the Golden State Freeway after both tried to avoid 
hitting a huge metal object early Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Rodriguez Sierra, 39, and her husband, Guillermo Cardenas Sierra, 28, of 
Los Angeles were pronounced dead at the scene, said Pat Marek, spokesman for 
the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred just before 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes of the freeway, 
south of the Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers said the accident was caused by a 
2,000-pound ramp -- used to load heavy equipment onto trucks -- that apparently 
had fallen onto the road from another vehicle. The driver of that vehicle was 
being sought. 
</P>
<P>
The car carrying the victims struck the ramp and began to spin clockwise and to 
the right, said Officer Vince Zambrana. The truck was traveling behind the car 
and also hit the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The truck veered to the right, then broadsided the car, pushing it 400 to 500 
feet north, Zambrana said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the collision left the car jammed underneath the truck, Marek 
said. Firefighters worked for 45 minutes to free two surviving passengers from 
the wreckage using the "Jaws of Life." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas McNeal, 50, and Elia Acosta, 30, were listed in critical condition at 
County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck was unharmed and there were no other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The accident left traffic backed up for miles during the morning commute, a CHP 
officer said. Three lanes of the northbound Golden State Freeway were blocked 
off and a SigAlert remained in affect until noon.

GREAT AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY ENDS ON NOTE OF FAILURE; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE SAN DIEGO-BASED SAVINGS AND LOAN WAS A PIONEER AND A POWERHOUSE IN 
THE INDUSTRY. BUT THEN IT ACQUIRED HOME FEDERAL SAVINGS OF TUCSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid 1980s, Great American Bank seemed to have it all going its way. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Gordon Luce, a politically well connected and socially prominent 
Republican, had built the San Diego-based savings and loan into one of the 
industry's powerhouses. By the end of 1985, Luce had grown it to 117 branches 
and $8.2 billion in assets, up from three offices and $300 million in assets 
when he joined the thrift, then known as San Diego Federal, in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
By tracking the immense California population growth with new branches, and by 
introducing a number of customer service and marketing innovations -- from 
automated teller machines to standardized branch design -- Luce helped pioneer 
the concept of a statewide S&amp;L, industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's solid growth -- combined with Luce's close relationship with 
Ronald Reagan -- made him one of the five or six most powerful men in the 
S&amp;L industry. An early political backer, fund raiser and trusted adviser to 
the ex-actor, Luce was Governor Reagan's state Secretary for Business and 
Transportation. After Reagan became president, Luce became a special United 
Nations delegate. 
</P>
<P>
Luce's political pull was demonstrated by the fact that two of his 
ex-lieutenants at Great American, Edwin J. Gray and Lawrence W. Taggart, got 
appointed as top S&amp;L industry regulators -- Gray as Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board chairman and Taggart as state S&amp;L department chairman. Luce himself 
served a term as president of the California League of Savings Institutions, a 
statewide trade group. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, Luce and Great American took a wrong turn, perhaps a fatal one, by 
acquiring Home Federal Savings of Tucson. What was designed as a bid to 
dramatically expand the scope of Great American's branches and business 
activities instead has brought the S&amp;L, with its 213 branches and $15.9 
billion in assets, to the brink of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
Great American thus joins a growing list of hundreds of once-successful thrifts 
that have tumbled in recent years, adding to a massive S&amp;L debacle that 
could easily cost taxpayers upwards of $200 billion to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
But the downfall of the San Diego thrift is not your typical story of thrift 
failure. Its downfall was not due to fraud or questionable activities by 
industry outsiders, or due to investments in risky junk bonds or pie-in-the-sky 
real estate developments. Instead, it was due to simple mistakes and 
miscalculations by an experienced management team that had been well-respected 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the thrift's problems have dimmed the considerable prestige of the 
64-year-old Luce, scion of a pioneer San Diego family and benefactor of various 
local arts and community causes. 
</P>
<P>
In his 1986 annual report to shareholders, Luce said the acquisition of the 
Arizona S&amp;L, with its $2.4 billion in assets and 41 branches, would enable 
Great American to buy its way into a booming state where population, personal 
income and economic growth was far outstripping the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Great American bought into an economic black hole, an 
overbuilt and deflating real estate market whose problems have yet to bottom. 
On Tuesday, Great American announced that its growing heap of bad loans, most 
acquired through the Arizona deal, had weakened it to the point that it faces a 
possible seizure by regulators unless it can merge with another financial 
institution or raise $350 million in outside capital by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
An extended review by auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche of Great American's 
fourth-quarter and full-year 1989 financial statement resulted in the S&amp;L 
taking bad-loan loss provisions for 1989 totaling $405 million, the bulk of 
which were attributed to the Arizona portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The write-offs brought Great American's 1989 loss to $263.4 million, leaving it 
severely deficient in all three capital adequacy tests applied by the 
government as required by last summer's S&amp;L bailout bill. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight enables anyone to observe that Great American's move across state 
lines into Arizona had all the makings of a debacle because it overlooked the 
principle that successful real estate lending is built on management's 
first-hand knowledge of local markets. 
</P>
<P>
But even when Great American proposed the Arizona acquisition, the deal raised 
the hackles of regulators and some analysts. A spokesman for the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board said at the time that a merger of the sort proposed by Great 
American "generally speaking has not been permitted." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the inherent risks involved, regulatory policy up to that point was 
"not to approve across-state-line mergers," S&amp;L stock analyst Allan Bortel 
said then, although he pointed out there was no formal rule against the 
mergers. 
</P>
<P>
Misgivings notwithstanding, regulators approved the move. And Great American 
wasn't through with out-of-state deals. In 1987 it acquired Capital Savings of 
Olympia, Wash., which then operated 37 branches in Washington and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's strategy of expanding through out-of-state mergers contrasted 
sharply with that of HomeFed Bank, Great American's San Diego-based rival which 
now has $18 billion in assets. HomeFed has stubbornly stuck to a 
California-only growth plan and in the process has remained healthy. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for Great American's Arizona acquisition to go sour. The 
S&amp;L's 1987 provisions for bad loans totaled $45 million, up 80% from the 
previous year's, with the S&amp;L citing Arizona problems as the major cause. 
Things went rapidly downhill from there with loan-loss provisions reaching 
$119.8 million in 1988 and $405 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
With so many of its loans in trouble, Great American's interest-rate spread -- 
its loan income less the amount it pays to depositors -- has become 
progressively thinner. For the nine months ended last Sept. 30, Great 
American's spread was only 0.62 percentage points, significantly less than the 
2-to-2.5-point spread seen at healthy S&amp;Ls, said William C. Ferguson, a 
Washington, D.C.-based consultant to banks and S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's interest-rate spread as of Sept. 30, for example, was 2.02 points, 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
The future looks decidedly bleak for Great American. Analysts see an 
acquisition by a larger bank such as Wells Fargo or Security Pacific -- both of 
which say they've taken a look at Great American -- as the best alternative for 
shareholders. Each bank in the past year has targeted San Diego for expansion. 
Security Pacific had done it through acquisitions of Southwest Bancorp of Vista 
and La Jolla Bank &amp; Trust, while Wells Fargo is in the process of acquiring 
Torrey Pines Bank of Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
If it is interested, Wells Fargo probably would have the inside track in buying 
Great American because of the bank's strong stock price, which is increasingly 
becoming the currency used by bankers to acquire other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
But pessimists say potential buyers may wait for regulators to seize the 
S&amp;L and take responsibility for the Arizona problems before making offers. 
Most of those interviewed say Great American has a slim chance at best to raise 
the $350 million it needs to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
For regulators, a quick sale would be a blessing. Their resources are stretched 
thin in the wake of recent takeovers of such large institutions as Imperial 
Savings and Mercury Savings in California, CenTrust Bank in Florida and 
Franklin Savings in Kansas. In addition, regulators are closely monitoring 
several other major California thrifts that are in danger of being seized, 
including Columbia Savings, Valley Federal and Santa Barbara Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have been considering a plan that would involve putting 
federal money into troubled thrifts without actually seizing them. One such 
method would involve having outside investors injecting some cash into the 
thrifts, and having the government put in some money as well. The argument is 
that thrifts quickly lose value once they are taken over. The proposal, 
however, has yet to be approved by regulators and is at least several months 
away.

COMPUTER FILE: KIDS' PROJECTS: A WONDROUS LOOK AT FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

While thousands of Macintosh users flocked to San Francisco's two main 
convention centers for this spring's MacWorld Expo last week, a much smaller 
group attended an Apple Computer-sponsored symposium called "Children: the 
Future of America." The education conference, open by invitation only, drew 
about 100 superintendents and other senior-level officials from many of the 
nation's urban school districts. 
</P>
<P>
I spent two days shuttling between the two events and couldn't help but be 
struck with the differences in their agendas. The MacWorld Expo was an emporium 
of high-tech wonders where the movers and shakers demonstrated large-screen 
color monitors, high-capacity optical disk drives, powerful graphic software 
and plenty of other state-of-the-art software and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the Expo is aimed at businesses that are using high-tech to 
improve productivity. The issues under discussion are relatively transient. As 
important as they are to the computer industry and die-hard users, it's hard 
for most people to relate to such concerns as Macintosh graphic interface 
versus Microsoft Windows, Apple's soon-to-be-released Operating System 7.0 and 
the advantages and costs of 32-bit color. 
</P>
<P>
Very different, but all too familiar, issues were discussed at the education 
conference. While the bulk of the discussion focused on technology, many of the 
underlying themes stressed the backdrop under which the nation educates its 
children. Words such as poverty, overcrowding, drugs and despair are rarely 
uttered at computer industry events. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Apple's most zealous advocates would claim that technology, by itself, 
can provide the answers, but just about everyone in attendance agreed that it 
can play a role in helping to educate and motivate young people. As does any 
tool, it works best when placed in the hands of skilled craftsmen -- in this 
case, bright and caring teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Apple did not use the conference to sell its products, the company's 
interest in education goes far beyond humanitarian concerns. Apple has its 
roots in education and continues to enjoy strong sales in the kindergarten 
through 12th grade and higher education markets. Education represents about a 
third of the company's domestic revenue, according to spokeswoman Sandra 
Bateman. 
</P>
<P>
While the MacWorld Expo showcased hardware and software, the stars at the 
education conference were the people who are using the technology: students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dye, a teacher at Sunnyside High School in Tucson, Ariz., bought his own 
Macintosh in the spring of 1988 and used it to help organize the Systems 
Thinking Club. The club, composed of 10 students, mostly Latino, is working 
with the Macintosh and a program called STELLA (Structural Thinking 
Experimental Learning Laboratory with Animation) to create behavioral models to 
test various theories in science and human behavior. Using a graphic display, 
the program shows the logical consequences of certain behaviors over time. Dye 
and a group of his students mesmerized conference attendees with a 
demonstration of their projects, including one model that shows the logical, 
and deadly, consequences of gang participation. 
</P>
<P>
Dye also uses SimCity, a city simulation program from Maxis Software. The 
program, which runs on IBM PCs and compatibles and Macs, allows the students to 
design their own city, complete with roads, buildings, dump sites and all the 
inherent costs and problems. The program, according to Dye, is an excellent way 
to help students understand how systems are interrelated. 
</P>

Paul Reese is doing impressive work at the Ralph Bunche School, an elementary 
school in New York's Central Harlem. Reese brought a group of sixth graders to 
San Francisco to demonstrate a replica of Earth Lab, a school-wide network of 
Apple IIs and Macintoshes connected to a central AppleShare file server. The 
students use electronic mail to communicate with each other and with students 
from other schools. Using a modem connected to one of their Apple IIs, they 
download weather data to help predict storm patterns. The kids use a network 
version of Bank Street Writer word-processing software and write programs using 
LogoWriter for the Apple II. 
</P>
<P>
The school has 13 Apple IIs and six Macs on its network. Reese starts third 
graders with keyboarding exercises. Fourth graders are doing word processing. 
The full services of the lab are available to his sixth-grade students. The 
younger children tend to prefer the color Apple IIs but the older kids always 
gravitate towards the Mac Pluses and SEs, according to Reese. 
</P>

The Los Angeles Unified School District's Model Technology School Project, 
housed at Bell High School, serves Bell along with a junior high and two 
elementary schools. The project, which operates under a $500,000 grant from the 
state of California along with $50,000 of local funding, furnishes computers, 
video equipment and other high-technology tools to the students. Technology 
centers at each of the two elementary schools feature 33 Tandy IBM compatibles 
and 13 Macintoshes along with a number of peripheral devices including flatbed 
scanners, video digitizers and interactive laser disc players that can be 
controlled by the computers. 
</P>
<P>
The four schools in the project are large and more than 90% Latino. One 
elementary school has more than 2,000 students. All operate on a year-round 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Students, from kindergarten through the fifth grade, are creating and editing 
their own videotapes. They use Apple's HyperCard language to develop their own 
software and use computers and laser printers to produce a variety of 
newsletters and other publications, according to project coordinator Ted 
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have no trouble with the equipment," said Snyder. "Our biggest 
challenge is to get the teachers to release their control so that they can 
empower the children." Teachers, according to Snyder, "have got to tolerate a 
high level of chaos -- the noise level is high but the kids are almost always 
on task." 
</P>
<P>
Students learn science principles from a set of video discs from Optical Data 
Corp. The materials, called Windows on Science, include discs covering earth, 
physical and life sciences. Each disc has soundtracks in both English and 
Spanish. The video discs can be controlled interactively from a Macintosh using 
software written under Apple's HyperCard language. The computer makes it 
possible to jump to any portion of the disc depending on the child's interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Bell project is one of six Model Technology School Projects coordinated by 
the Office of Educational Technology, California State Department of Education. 
Other projects are in Alhambra, Cupertino/Fremont, Hueneme, Monterey and 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
After the education conference ended, I dragged myself back to Moscone Center 
to see a new database program, an upcoming version of WordPerfect Mac and a new 
modular keyboard from Datadesk International that will make it easier to enter 
data. I saw a lot of good products at the Expo, but it was hard to get excited. 
Energetic children are a hard act to follow.

Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.: The nation's largest brokerage reported a 16% rise to 
$41.3 million in its first-quarter profit, compared to the like period last 
year. However, the New York-based company's revenue fell 5% to $2.66 billion. 
The firm attributed its profit increase to cost-cutting efforts implemented as 
part of a previously announced restructuring.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: DICEON LOSES $1.4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diceon Electronics, the Irvine circuit board manufacturer, lost $1.4 million 
for its 1990 fiscal second quarter, down from the $1.3 million it lost for the 
quarter a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended March 31 were $32.7 million, 
11% over the $29.5 million for the period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Its loss for the first half was $2.6 million; it was $1 million for the first 
six months last year. Revenue declined slightly, to $59.4 million from $60.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it has been affected by an inability to raise prices because 
of the overcapacity in the industry caused by increases in offshore 
competition, a slowing in the information systems industry, and an effort by 
electronic equipment manufacturers to reduce components.

JACK SMITH: IT'S NOT THE CHORES; IT'S THOSE DREADFUL DECISIONS 
</P>

<P>
I have often heard the sardonic term "house husband," but I never thought of it 
as applying to me. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, I thought, the feminists had not made so many gains in recent years 
only to have the insufferable epithets by which they were once defined passed 
on to men. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that I think "housewife" is a demeaning term; millions of women 
regard themselves as housewifes and are proud of it. On the other hand, many 
other millions despise the term and all that it means. 
</P>
<P>
For some years now, I have been working at home, while my wife works outside at 
the Southern California Counseling Center. I must confess that when we first 
made this change, reversing our old routine, I did not automatically pick up 
all the chores that she had previously done. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing I do not do the shopping, except that I usually keep us in wines 
and spirits. My wife does the shopping on the way home from work. On Saturdays 
she takes the laundry to the Laundromat and brings home the previous week's 
load. During the week she does the ironing. She seems to have some affinity for 
it. Usually she irons while she's watching television. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she does the cooking. I get my own breakfast and lunch, but she usually 
pops a couple of microwave dinners into the oven when she comes home from work 
and we eat while watching sex and violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy housework is done once a week by a cleaning woman. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently that leaves me little to do. Don't kid yourself. This past week 
alone the details of housekeeping that I have had to attend to have driven me 
up the wall. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Fire Department required, as it does every year, that we eliminate 
the weeds around the canyon behind our house. That is a job that always costs 
more than $200. Fortunately I have a good man who knows when it's time and 
comes around to my door. I just tell him to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Then the refrigerator broke down. We had to move all our frozen foods down to 
the refrigerator in the garage and of course I had to call Montgomery Ward to 
ask for service. They said we were covered by our warranty and sent a man 
promptly. He said the fridge needed a new timer and put one in. 
</P>
<P>
Then the television went out of sync. We were getting a hideous double image 
and the sound was breaking up. At the same time I decided that me might as well 
add HBO, so we could see more sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
I called Cable TV and told them my problem. They said they would send two men 
-- one for each job. I said I would be home between 1 and 5 p.m. Later I got a 
phone call from Cable TV. It was a recording. A woman said that if I was going 
to be home from 1 to 5 p.m. to hang up immediately. I hung up. More and more, 
conversation seems to be out of date. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the refrigerator went out again. I called Montgomery Ward and they 
said they would send out another man. Meanwhile, a man came from Cable TV. He 
had to go under the house and replace the cable. Then he went up a pole outside 
and dropped a new line. He had not only fixed the double image, he had 
installed HBO. 
</P>
<P>
"Another man is supposed to do that," I said. Installation was supposed to be 
free if I contributed $10 or more to the Woodcraft Rangers. He shrugged. "Tell 
him it's already in." 
</P>
<P>
The second man came. I told him HBO was already in. He shrugged and asked for a 
check. I gave him a check for $25 for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the second refrigerator man came. He said the door wasn't shutting 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the brush man said his crew had finished clearing the brush and he 
wanted a check. He suggested that I also employ him to clean the leaves off the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
"Your roof's going to leak," he said. I told him to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't only that these exigencies are disruptive of one's work; the worst 
part is the decisions, the wear and tear, the stress. 
</P>
<P>
I don't look forward to the day we start remodeling.

* In Deep: New York Post publisher Peter Kalikow wants to build a 420-foot dock 
for his boat fleet near his mansion near Long Island, N.Y. But the dock would 
cut through 45 underwater acres he owns, possibly damaging marine life, said a 
local zoning appeals board. "The only conceivable residential use for 
underwater land is a private dock," Kalikow's lawyer, George Biondo, told the 
board, whose members mentioned possible chemical spills from the boats and 
disruption of scallop beds. The board makes its decision in May.

night before his death, gasped when she learned of Abernathy's death Tuesday. 
"My sympathy goes out to his family. At one time we were friends, and that's

her suit.

under consideration."

"How old are you, Gramps?" one of them asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty old," the man replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you old enough to remember Earth Day?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yup, it was in April 22, 1970, but it seems like yesterday. It's hard to 
describe it if you weren't there. Fumes were coming out of the tailpipes of 
cars, black smoke was billowing from factory chimneys, and we soon discovered 
we had something called acid rain that killed all the fish in the freshwater 
lakes." 
</P>
<P>
"Aw," said one of the kids. "No one would be stupid enough to kill all the 
fish." 
</P>
<P>
"It was worse than that. People threw anything they wanted into the rivers, and 
they flushed garbage and other stuff into the ocean. I saw it myself. We 
couldn't even go swimming on the beaches because it wasn't safe." 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," yelled one little boy. "I'm glad that I wasn't alive then." 
</P>
<P>
"Developers built houses over nuclear waste sites, and legitimate companies 
hired gangsters to dump poisonous waste material from one end of the country to 
the other. Nobody in the government would take responsibility for it. In those 
days the average citizen didn't do too well against the lobbyists when they 
appealed their case to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
"Not like today, huh, Gramps?" one of the kids laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right. Today the government really worries about its dumps. Before 
Earth Day people sprayed insecticide on everything. That's because no one knew 
it was bad for kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Have they stopped spraying?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Gramps told him, "but they now give you time to cover your car with 
plastic and crawl into your house. I guess the biggest thing that concerned us 
in those days was pesticides running off into the drinking water. The chemical 
companies claimed that we had nothing to be afraid of and, to prove it, the 
president of a company drank a glass of water on TV." 
</P>
<P>
"They must have been exciting times, Gramps." 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty wild in those days. We used to throw our bottles into the 
street and burn our trash in the back yard and even toss Styrofoam plates and 
cups into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
"We still do that," another boy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you can't expect the population to change its habits in just 20 years. 
Our one objective on Earth Day was to prevent the next generation from 
inheriting a cesspool. Two decades ago we declared, 'Enough is enough. We have 
to make the highway smell like the sea breeze and the sea breeze smell like the 
highway.' Of course, everyone was for it even after they found out how much it 
would cost." 
</P>
<P>
"So what did you do when you found out how much money was involved, Gramps?" 
</P>
<P>
"We sang a lot -- mostly, 'this land was made for you and me.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure you're telling us the truth, Gramps?" 
</P>
<P>
"What part do you mean, son?" 
</P>
<P>
"The part where people didn't care what they discarded or where they discarded 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"I swear to you it was that way. I know it's hard for you kids to imagine how 
different it was compared with how spic and span everything is today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so bad then that you couldn't see the forests for the rain."

YOUR COINS: WHAT IS CONSIDERED 'FAIR' MARKUP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: As a result of your column, I subscribed to the Coin Dealer 
Newsletter and discovered that I have been paying sizable premiums over the 
quoted prices to my dealer. I realize that the quoted prices are for 
"dealer-to-dealer" transactions, and that I can expect to pay a premium over 
the quoted price. Here's my question: Is there an average markup that an 
off-the-street buyer can expect to pay, or is the price whatever the traffic 
will bear? What is considered fair in these transactions? -- J.T. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You've cut to the bone of coin collecting -- the relationship between 
dealer and collector. There should be a feeling of mutual trust. The collector 
should feel he is paying a fair price; the dealer should feel customer loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
As a collector, you did the right thing by subscribing to the Coin Dealer 
Newsletter. It was a way for you to verify prices. Some dealers will share 
their price guide with collectors. Sometimes the dealer will reveal exactly 
what he paid for a coin. That way, you know what the markup is. 
</P>
<P>
A good dealer will pass good buys along to his customers. A good collector will 
learn the fine points of numismatics, especially grading. That way, it won't be 
necessary to ask what is fair. You'll know. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want an education, try to sit in on some dealer-to-dealer 
transactions. They really go at it. And when a deal is struck, you'll have a 
pretty good idea what a particular coin is worth at that particular time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have several coins that, as far as I can tell, do not have any mint marks. 
They are two quarters dated 1965, one quarter dated 1966, one quarter dated 
1978, two nickels dated 1973, one nickel dated 1964 and one penny dated 1980. 
Are they worth more than face value? -- R.J.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: Only regular U.S. coins dated 1964 and before contained silver. Your 1964 
nickel is mostly copper and nickel. Wartime nickels (1942-45) did contain some 
silver. Your coins, as you may have suspected, are just worth face value. 
</P>

Coin News 
</P>
<P>
Mintages don't always tell the story regarding coin rarity. The 1893-S $1, for 
example, had a mintage of 100,000 but only a handful of gems are known to 
exist. The finest known (pictured) is graded Mint State 65 by the Numismatic 
Guaranty Corp. It sold for $52,000 in 1978 and for $100,000 in 1980. It will be 
featured in the Sussex Collection Sale in New York June 11 through 13. 
Catalogues are $20 from Auctions by Bowers and Merena, Box 1224, Wolfeboro, 
N.H. 03894.

<P>
Uncut currency sheets are an interesting method of collecting $1 Federal 
Reserve notes. There are 32-note sheets for $47, 16-note sheets for $28 and 
4-note sheets for $10.25. Shipment of currency from the Philadelphia Federal 
Reserve will begin about April 15. Mail requests to the Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing, Public Sales, Room 602-11A, 14th and C streets S.W., Washington, D.C.

RICE NOT PERFECT FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON, Neil Solomon is the author of Sick &amp; Tired of Being 
Sick &amp; Tired, Wynwood Press.

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I enjoy watching the programs on public television that deal with the 
way people live in other parts of the world. It seems to me that in many 
countries, children are brought up on rice, if they're lucky, and little else. 
</P>
<P>
Is rice such a wonder food that it can provide everything a child needs in the 
way of a nutritious diet? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Children who live almost entirely on rice do so out of necessity, not 
out of choice. In many cases, the alternative is not to eat at all. 
</P>
<P>
No single food can provide all of the child's nutritional needs, and rice is no 
exception. For example, rice provides almost no Vitamin A, which is essential 
for good vision. Children on all-rice diets who do not receive Vitamin A 
supplements are at risk of blindness.

ERMA BOMBECK: TV FAMILIES JUST DON'T GET PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, the Cosby clan gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the family 
sitcom and brought it back to life. TV families appeared in every conceivable 
combination. There is a mother raising two children alone, three children 
raising their grandfather alone, three guys with a house full of kids (I have 
no idea to whom they belong), adopted parents, laminated families from several 
marriages, and an aunt who raises three boys whose mother split due to contract 
problems. There are blue-collar families, white-collar families and 
ring-around-the-collar families. 
</P>
<P>
I have followed closely the lives of these households and have yet to see one 
that parallels my own: a family that can go through 30 minutes without a single 
laugh. Sometimes we go for weeks! If we had a laugh-track, it wouldn't laugh. 
</P>
<P>
I think I've figured out why. There are glaring discrepancies between real life 
and sitcoms. In a series, the parents are always wise and profound. They pass 
out advice as if they were passing out napkins at a picnic. In the last five 
minutes, the kids realize their parents are once again infallible and thank 
them for setting them right. 
</P>
<P>
Let's talk real life. Your child buys a used car with 210,000 miles on it. You 
tell him it won't run. It doesn't. You predict he will spend the rest of his 
life visiting his car in a garage. He does. You tell him it was the biggest 
mistake of his entire life. He sells it for three times what he paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
Sitcom parents are protected by contracts. They are not going to get killed off 
because they're stars with lines. If something bad happens to them, they'll 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, parents live on the edge. When you climb into the car with a child 
who is on his fifth "temp" and the car radio renders you sterile, there are no 
guarantees you are ever coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Real-life teen-agers speak only five words a year to their parents, yet on 
television they bond their brains out. They all sit down to the dinner table 
together (all on one side of the table facing the camera). When was the last 
time that happened in your house? 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, family comedy always has the siblings at odds with one 
another. Insults and threats get big laughs. The reality is that it's kids 
versus parents. Any couple foolish enough to have three children will be 
outvoted for the rest of their lives. They become the great minority. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote a family sitcom once that incorporated reality into the script. The 
powers that be said it looked like we didn't love one another and advised me to 
put more laughs in. It was canceled in eight weeks. My family is still playing 
. . . every week.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PAPA JOHN CREACH STILL KICKIN' AROUND 
THE STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violinist Papa John Creach would like to record another album someday, but his 
style seems too elusive for commercial tastemakers. 
</P>
<P>
"They can categorize me, all right. They can say, 'He plays everything,' " 
joked Creach, who opened three weeks at Elario's in La Jolla last night. "I 
haven't recorded in a while, and I don't know which way to go. It's really a 
confusing operation with me. I play sweet stuff, rock, blues and jazz. You 
can't mix all that up together on a recording. It would be too confusing for a 
commercial operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I like all of it. It really keeps me kickin,' " said Creach, who turns 73 next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences don't have any trouble warming up to his wide-ranging sets. Although 
he's best known to some for the soaring, electric sound he added to the 
Jefferson Airplane in the early 1970s and the Airplane offshoot Hot Tuna, 
Creach is a walking encyclopedia of jazz, rock and blues who first plugged in a 
violin in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has slowed his touring pace, but still likes to work with 
young musicians. He goes on the road regularly with such rock bands as the 
Dinosaurs, visits Elario's annually and plays regularly in clubs not far from 
his home near Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Creach has arrived at the ideal formula for producing his 
trademark warm, fat sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a violin that cuts through the music. A soft tone is too mushy. I 
usually use a Romanian fiddle made in the 1800s. Lots of guys take one song and 
they wear out a bow. Doug Kershaw's a good example. But I don't press too hard 
on the strings. That gives me a nice, big, fat, round tone." 
</P>
<P>
When Creach taped one of KPBS-TV's (Channel 15) "Club Date" programs in San 
Diego two years ago, he was backed by a trio of locals. For this visit, he 
imported regular band mates Duane Smith on piano and Maurice Miller on drums 
from Los Angeles, to be joined by San Diegan Bob Magnusson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Trombonists generally function as background players, but singer Aubrey Fay has 
made the big brass a mainstay of his stage act. Fay, who plays the B Street 
Cafe in downtown San Diego tonight through Saturday, first realized the horn's 
potential when he heard one of the greats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about my idol, J. J. Johnson. He redefined the instrument with 
speed. Before him, Kid Ory was more of a slur-gliss player," Fay said, 
referring to the slow, sliding style of playing that was popular during jazz's 
early years. "When I was learning, all parts with sixteenth or eighth notes 
were omitted for trombone. Then J. J. came along and changed all that with the 
shotgun style of staccato, short notes." 
</P>
<P>
Fay, both a singer and a horn player, grew up around music. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz took over for me at an early age. My dad used to play it a lot. The guy's 
a nut over jazz -- not a musician, but a big fan. When I said I wanted to play 
trombone, it didn't knock him out, but he was kind of excited. At 5 years old, 
I knew who Basie, Ellington and Glen Miller were. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a guy named Mr. Coady who ran Coady's School of Music on Broadway in 
downtown San Diego. I was in parochial school, and they came to demonstrate the 
instruments. I remember this guy, Bart Hazlett, had a Dixieland band, and he 
came in and played 'Stars and Stripes Forever' with these great slides, and I 
said, 'I gotta have that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fay continued with the trombone at St. Augustine High School, San Diego City 
College and San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fluke when he discovered his singing talent. As a young professional, 
he was working with a band in San Diego clubs, and one night the male singer 
didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou Rawls was real popular at the time, 'Your Good Thing Is About to Come to 
an End.' I thought I could sing it. Well, I brought the house down, and that 
was the beginning right there." 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Aubrey Fay Band mixes diverse music, from bop to popular tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"People will hear mainstream, be-bop stuff like 'Billy's Bounce,' I'll play 
that on trombone, then I'll turn around and sing a blues like 'I'd Rather Drink 
Muddy Water' or 'Every Day I Have the Blues.' 
</P>
<P>
"The scat thing seems to be popular. I take 'On Broadway' or some other 
contemporary tune and incorporate improvising. Or songs like 'Stormy' or 'Me 
and Mrs. Jones.' I've got my own style, but it reminds people of Lou Rawls." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the club scene, Fay recently played on the sound track for a children's 
TV pilot called "Down Munchkin Alley," taped in Fallbrook. He writes his own 
music and hopes eventually to self-produce a CD of all-original tunes. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The San Diego Jazz Society appears to be the leading contender to run

Garbo Really Alone: Greta Garbo described herself in a 1926 letter as a lonely 
girl who was homesick for her native Sweden, according to a secret file opened 
by officials at Stockholm's Royal Library. 
</P>
<P>
"I live very lonely in a place where I am left absolutely alone, I go out for 
walks sometimes alone, look at the sky and the water and talk to myself," Garbo 
wrote from Hollywood to her actress friend, Vera Schmiterlov. The letter had a 
drawing of a crying girl, topped by the word "homesick." The 84-year-old 
reclusive star died in New York on Easter Sunday. GREG BRAXTON

Taylor Denies AIDS Rumors: Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized for more than a week 
with a sinus condition and fever, said Tuesday that she has now been diagnosed 
with pneumonia and denied rumors that she has AIDS. Taylor, 58, was transferred 
by ambulance Tuesday from Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey to 
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. The actress said in a statement that she 
has been tested for AIDS, and the results "are negative." GREG BRAXTON

POP BEAT: IN 'STRANGE LOVE,' T.S.O.L. BLENDS GRIT, VERSATILITY; 
</P>
<P>
RECORDINGS FROM FELLOW O.C.-BASED PERFORMERS -- COUNTRY SINGER JANN BROWNE AND 
SYNTH-POP ANYTHING BOX -- OFFER PLENTY OF VARIETY.

Performers from the Orange County pop scene continue to churn out recordings at 
a furious pace, making 1990 an exceptional year for quantity, quality and 
stylistic breadth. Those reviewed below are rated on a scale from * (poor) to 
***** (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L. 
</P>
<P>
"Strange Love" (Enigma) 
</P>
<P>
With the recent departure of founding bassist Mike Roche, T.S.O.L. lost the 
last strand connecting the band to its origins a decade ago as a Huntington 
Beach punk group. Musically, though, that connection had ended with the 1987 
album, "Hit and Run," which veered away from punk and deeply into heavy metal. 
A sell-out? Die-hard punkers may say so. But if "Strange Love" is an obvious 
bid for mass-appeal commercial success, it is a bid made with honor intact. 
</P>
<P>
At its worst, heavy metal offers escapist fantasies of power, rebellion and 
easy, emotion-free sex. The strong point of "Strange Love" is the way in which 
it baits pop-metal hooks as enticing as Def Leppard's or Bon Jovi's, while 
still maintaining sonic grit and impact and a fatalistic outlook that is by no 
means escapist. The protagonists of T.S.O.L.'s songs aren't sexual studs and 
hard-rockin' heroes, but, in most cases, victims trying to shake off emotional 
blows -- if they haven't already been brought down by something more final, 
like a policeman's bullet or a drug overdose. In that respect, T.S.O.L. still 
has a streak of punk-rock realism running through its work. 
</P>
<P>
The songs, though, are painted on metal's epic canvas. That leads to broad 
statements and big gestures that don't allow much room for lyrical subtlety -- 
and singer Joe Wood won't ever be mistaken for a crafty wordsmith. But if the 
idea on a number of songs is no more complex than 
life-is-tough-and-you've-got-to-have-guts-to-survive, at least that's a point 
worth making. 
</P>
<P>
The best songs are "Let Me Go," a ballad that recasts the old "Streets of 
Laredo" cowboy death-rattle scenario, and "Candy," where T.S.O.L. gets low-down 
and bluesy in a humorous tale about a drug moll on the lam who always seems to 
get the drop on the song's luckless pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
Versatility is one of the album's assets, as T.S.O.L. ranges from the raunchy 
blues of "Candy" to the impressive head-banging momentum of "Blow by Blow," to 
the sorrowful grandeur of "Angel" and the stormy, elegiac sweep of "In the 
Wind." Wood's singing remains as raw and grainy as ever, but his voice has more 
range and flexibility than in the past. Lead guitarist Marshall Rohner's 
performance is for the most part a model of conciseness, high impact and 
disdain for the noisy, note-spattering excess of metal-guitar convention 
(Rohner, like Roche, is no longer in the band, which now has bassist Dave Mello 
and guitarist Scott Phillips playing alongside Wood and drummer Mitch Dean). 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L.'s punk past may be gone, but "Strange Love" is a strong bid from a 
band whose realism and no-frills gumption stand as a healthy example in its new 
field. 
</P>
<P>

JANN BROWNE 
</P>
<P>
"Tell Me Why" (Curb) 
</P>
<P>
This Orange County veteran's first album offers almost everything you could ask 
from a country music new traditionalist. The only thing missing is what the 
neo-traditionalist movement needs most if it is to keep (by now, regain might 
be a more appropriate verb) its vigor: a willingness to break from tradition 
with bold, imaginative sallies. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's album showcases a voice full of classic sweetness and assured, throaty 
twang (from the sound of it, Emmylou Harris is a big influence). She can ache 
on a lovelorn ballad, or rock a little when the action moves to the honky tonk. 
And if you can judge a performer by the company she keeps, Browne comes with 
the seal of approval. Harris harmonizes on the south-of-the-border lament, 
"Mexican Wind," New Grass Revival provides the backup on the plaintive 
bluegrass tune, "Lovebird," and elsewhere Browne's ace picking staff includes 
such players as Albert Lee, Byron Berline and the Desert Rose Band's John 
Jorgenson and Bill Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to an album full of impeccable performances. But, putting aside 
the simple appeal of good singin' and good playin,' all that impeccable talent 
is serving songs that too often fall into familiar ruts. Numbers like 
"Louisville" (one of three tunes that Browne co-wrote) and "Losing You" do 
little to make country's oldest subject -- heartbreak -- sound fresh again. 
"Louisville" starts with a good premise -- woman travels to a rendezvous point 
in the middle of the country and waits six weeks, only to be jilted by her 
lover -- but Browne fails to build the song emotionally. It canters along as a 
simple, bittersweet lament when the situation cries out for an angry outburst. 
Most of the songs suffer from this one-note emotional tone, as Browne fails to 
explore the complexities of feeling that romantic crises surely bring. 
</P>
<P>
Browne does show some welcome sass on "You Ain't Down Home," by the O'Kanes' 
Jamie O'Hara. The cool, contemptuous edge in her voice as she laces into a 
trendy materialist devoted to gold cards, Jacuzzis and high-tech telephones is 
sharp enough to cow Donald Trump himself. The other highlight is "Lovebird," a 
sweet, sad bluegrass ballad that works on sheer loveliness. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell Me Why" shows that Browne has major league ability. Next time out, she 
needs to set herself apart from the crowd of country performers who offer lots 
of ability, but not enough individuality and imagination. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
ANYTHING BOX 
</P>
<P>
"Peace" (Epic) 
</P>
<P>
Originally from New Jersey, this synth-pop trio moved to La Habra last year to 
work under producer Jon St. James. Its debut album follows the basic pattern of 
such British techno-pop success stories as Depeche Mode, but with one atypical 
wrinkle: Instead of offering dark, brooding, ironic commentaries about how 
futile and corrupt the world is, Anything Box offers sweetly melancholy 
meditations on the sad state of life and love. 
</P>
<P>
Melody is the group's strong suit. "Living in Oblivion" and "Kiss of Love" 
feature insinuating refrains carried along by singer Claude S.'s fragile tenor. 
Songs are put together like Lego houses, out of discreet bits of linked melodic 
material. But the process becomes formulaic after a while: mechanical beats 
overlaid with soft keyboard gauze and a puff of vocal melody. The moods and 
methods repeat from song to song. Reinforcing this sameness is a reliance on 
repetition within individual songs, most of which go on too long without 
development or progression. 
</P>
<P>
Claude tends to drift in hazy reverie, mourning romantic disappointments and 
worldly conflicts while holding fast to his ideals. Occasionally he tries to 
switch from choirboy sweetness to a huskier lower range. But when he does, his 
voice isn't full-bodied enough to sound anything but forced. Instead of adding 
body and contrast to the sound, backing singer Dania Morales mirrors Claude's 
fragility. 
</P>
<P>
Anything Box succeeds best on songs that hint at a story line and a conflict. 
"Our Dreams" works nicely by setting Claude's plaintive vocal against an 
ominous beat -- a combination that follows the lyric's juxtaposition of 
innocent hopes against crushing realities. "Carmen" is another tale about an 
innocent wronged, and "Just One Day" at least gives some direction to Claude's 
romantic mooning, tracing his emotional state as it evolves over the course of 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
When the songs take a coherent shape, Anything Box holds some weight. Mostly, 
the music floats away on a pretty but diffuse cloud of melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER GROUND: Fullerton dance-pop singer Stacey Q has been studying Buddhism 
in Nepal for the past few months, raising questions about future career moves 
and, more immediately, about her safety in a Himalayan country racked recently 
by political turmoil. Earlier this month, a massive pro-democracy demonstration 
in the capital of Katmandu met with a violent government response before the 
nation's king relented and agreed to implement reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been really worried, but her mother said she called and said, 'Don't 
worry, everything's OK,' " Stacey Q's manager, Jon St. James, said Tuesday. 
"She was supposed to start a month ago on a new record for Atlantic. A week ago 
we got (a card): "Coming back in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
St. James says he isn't sure whether the singer (whose real name is Stacey 
Swain) is going to want to return to the lightly romantic mold of her three 
previous albums. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to expect," he said. "I don't think she's going to be in a 
frame of mind to work on a dance record." 
</P>
<P>
NEW LEATHER CHAPS: Leatherwolf, the Fountain Valley-based heavy metal band that 
recorded two albums for Island Records, has gone through some career 
reshuffling, personnel switches, and stylistic revamping over the past few 
months. Singer Mike Olivieri said Tuesday that he and guitarists Geoff Gayer 
and Carey Howe remain together from the original lineup, but the bass and drums 
team of Pat Guyton and Marco Forcone is new. Olivieri said that the band lost 
its recording deal after Island was bought out by PolyGram Records -- a move he 
said Leatherwolf took willingly, since the band felt Island hadn't given its 
releases enough of a promotional push. 
</P>
<P>
Now Leatherwolf is seeking a new record deal, with a new musical direction 
after two albums of gothic heavy metal full of complex guitar harmonies: "It's 
way more straight rock 'n' roll," Olivieri said. "I hate to jump on the Guns N' 
Roses bandwagon, but it's more in that vein." 
</P>
<P>
Leatherwolf also is contemplating a name change, but the band hasn't thought up 
anything permanent yet. When it plays Saturday night at the Marquee in 
Westminster, it will be billed as Wasted Flesh, a joke name that Olivieri said 
the members thought up just for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
FIDDLE ABOUT: Oklahoma-born bluegrass veterans Byron Berline and Alan Munde 
will team up for duo performances Saturday night at 7 and 9:30 at the Shade 
Tree in Laguna Niguel. Fiddler Berline, has performed with the Dillards, the 
Flying Burrito Brothers and his own band, Sundance, as well as playing on 
myriad sessions for the likes of Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones. Banjo player 
Munde first teamed with Berline in the Country Gazette in 1972. The show is the 
first in a spring series at the Shade Tree. On May 5, Tuxedo Cowboy, a local 
group with an unusual country-classical blend, will share the bill with pop 
songwriter George Lawton. Redmond O'Colonies sings humorous songs in the 
British music hall style on May 18. Highly regarded mandolin player Evan 
Marshall headlines June 2, with lute player David Rastall opening, and 
classical guitarist Gregory Coleman performs on June 16. Information: (714) 
364-5270. 
</P>
<P>

FRIEDKIN'S 'GUARDIAN' OPENS AFI FEST TONIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: THE AMBITIOUS GLOBAL PROGRAM WILL LAST TWO WEEKS AND OFFER MORE THAN 
200 TITLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The 1990 American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival has 
its gala opening tonight with the world premiere of William Friedkin's "The 
Guardian" -- a supernatural shocker that returns the director of "The Exorcist" 
to his old stomping and slashing ground, the horror-thriller genre. On May 3, 
the festival closes with the premiere of the restored version of Stanley 
Donen's "Funny Face." 
</P>
<P>
The two American films, both showing at the Cineplex Century Plaza in Century 
City, the festival's main venue, book-end a fat, two-week-long, 200-plus titles 
program that probably represents the peak of the AFI festival's four-year 
existence. This ambitious global program includes films from Western Europe, 
Asia, Australia, Africa and Latin America; a "Hollywood Glasnost" special 
section on Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries that unearths many long-banned 
gems; and a strong program of independent black American films. 
</P>
<P>
Also setting off the 1990 AFI Fest are the retrospectives planned for two great 
rarely-seen European filmmakers -- Greek director Theo Angelopoulos and 
Poland's Krzysztof Kieslowski. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' film reviewing staff -- Sheila Benson, Kevin Thomas, Peter Rainer, 
Chris Willman and myself -- covered most of the first week in last Sunday's 
Calendar. Here's an update, with special recommendations on movies screened 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
Highly recommended: "Sitting Pretty on a Branch" (Czechoslovakia), 
"Recollections of the Yellow House" (Portugal), "A Tribute to Charles and Ray 
Eames" (U.S.), "Love Among the Ruins" (U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: "Samsara" (China), "Queen of the Stardust Ballroom" (U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
In "Recollections of the Yellow House" (April 21), writer-director-star Joao 
Cesar Montiero, a skeletal looking bird, a sorrowful bookworm-buzzard, takes 
self-mockery and self-abasement far past Woody Allen. This film, which follows 
Montiero's quasi-autobiographical mishaps as a down-and-out intellectual in a 
bedbug-ridden Lisbon boarding house -- resembles Woody mixed with Dostoevski, 
Knut Hamsun and Louis-Ferdinand Celine: three literary monarchs of the lower 
depths whom Montiero occasionally quotes and often evokes. It's a painful 
comedy that goes unusually dark and deep; it was a Silver Lion winner at the 
last Venice Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Of the tribute to Charles and Ray Eames (April 21, 22), Sheila Benson reminds 
us that "the multi-talented Eameses represent a slice of time and place to 
Southern Californians" and feels that "this selection of the Eameses' own work, 
plus a marvelous, lively film on them by grandson Eames Demetrios, does them 
complete justice." 
</P>
<P>
According to Benson, "Sitting Pretty on a Branch" (April 26), a comic fairy 
tale on the aftermath of World War II by Czechoslovakia's Juraj Jaku Bisko, is 
a "magical film" and "a return to the great '60s period of Czechoslovakian 
cinema." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Thomas considers writer James Costigan's "Love Among the Ruins" (April 
24, AFI Mark Goodson), a 1976 made-for-TV courtroom comedy with Katharine 
Hepburn as a haughty breach-of-promise defendant and Laurence Olivier as her 
love-struck barrister, "director George Cukor's last great work . . . tinged 
with as much pathos as hilarity." Thomas also recommends Sam O'Steen's 
"Stardust Ballroom" (April 25), a "poignant 1975 made-for-TV love story," with 
Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning. 
</P>
<P>
Director Huang Jianxin's "Samsara" (April 22) is a Chinese film, made before 
the bloody May-June demonstrations, about a weak young man from the provinces 
drifting through the Peking underworld and slowly tarnishing his life and love. 
On one level, it's a familiar cautionary fable of big-city evil; its prime 
interest comes from its iconoclastic, offbeat views of a Mainland China now 
more closed to us. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Lange's low-budget "Othello" (April 26), with the one-time "ooo-eee" king 
of "The Love Boat" directing, adapting and playing the title role -- is a 
threadbare, labored, slightly over-sexy production, notable for its innovative 
black Iago (Hawthorne James). Thomas found Jean-Jacques Andrien's "Australia" 
(April 26) -- which, naturally enough, comes from Belgium -- "a decidedly 
pretentious title for a tedious, long-winded film" about homecomings and steamy 
affairs. Chris Willman thinks Margareta Kasimova's U.S.S.R. film, "Today and 
Always" (April 21), about a young actress bucking the provincial Muslim 
patriarchy, is "an interesting curiosity, with no consistency of tone." 
</P>
<P>
A long-time Duke Ellington fan, I liked "Sophisticated Lady" (April 21, AFI 
Mark Goodson), a documentary about Adelaide Hall, a Cotton Club chorus girl who 
popularized "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" in the '20s and did the 
growling, wordless lead vocal in Ellington's "Creole Love Call." 
</P>
<P>
Willman found "Painting the Town: The Illusionistic Murals of Richard Haas" 
(April 22, 24) a "feel-good documentary" about city muralist Haas, which may 
suffer from "unrelenting positivism" but "stands up as a pretty good, breezy 
look at a rare sort of upbeat American phenomenon."

COOK IT LIGHT: CABBAGE SALAD RECIPE CHANGED TO REDUCE FAT AND CALORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DEAR JEANNE: This salad is one I have enjoyed many times in the past; however, 
I am now on a low-fat diet. As you can see by the ingredients, one cup of salad 
oil does not meet low-fat standards and the amount of sugar seems high. Do you 
think you could modify this recipe and still leave it tasting about the same? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ELIZABETH, Orangevale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
CABBAGE SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 head green cabbage, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch green onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds 
</P>
<P>
1 package instant Soba noodles, cooked and drained 
</P>
<P>
5 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup salad oil 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons MSG 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
7 tablespoons white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Combine cabbage, onions, sesame seeds, almonds and noodles in large bowl. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, oil, MSG, pepper and vinegar. Pour over salad and mix 
thoroughly. Refrigerate, stirring every couple hours to marinate. Makes about 
12 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Salad is best made 1 day ahead. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ELIZABETH: I had to go to several markets to find the noodles, so if you 
don't have an Oriental market or a nearby large market with a well-stocked 
ethnic food section, you might want to experiment with some other kind of 
noodle such as linguine broken in short pieces and slightly undercooked, then 
well drained. 
</P>
<P>
The changes I have made substantially reduced the calories from fat, yet still 
retained the flavor range that makes this salad so delicious. Dark sesame oil 
instead of sesame seeds and apple-juice concentrate instead of sugar both 
worked beautifully. I deleted the MSG since it is not necessary and I prefer to 
avoid MSG in all recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEANNE 
</P>
<P>
HEALTHY CABBAGE SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped raw almonds 
</P>
<P>
1 (8-ounce) package instant Soba noodles 
</P>
<P>
1 head green cabbage, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
8 green onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup rice vinegar 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons dark sesame oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>

BARBECUE IS THE SPICE OF LIFE AND SOMETHING TO FIGHT ABOUT IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUITS: ONE JUICY EXAMPLE IS THE FIGHT BETWEEN TEXAS PIG STANDS AND HARD ROCK 
CAFE. THESE PEOPLE TAKE THE SOUTHERN DELICACY SERIOUSLY.

You won't find Barbecue Law offered in the catalogues of the nation's prestige 
law schools -- at least not yet. But if the paper chasers need instruction in 
that arcane science, they can turn to a recent case from the annals of the Lone 
Star State: Texas Pig Stands Inc. vs. Hard Rock Cafe International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Though the suit was filed in February of 1988 by Texas Pig Stands owner Richard 
Hailey -- who likes his barbecue with a reddish, slightly sweet-flavored sauce 
and sour dill relish -- the roots of the controversy go back to 1921, when the 
first Pig Stand was opened in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The small stand, which Hailey claims was the first drive-in restaurant in the 
country, featured a "pig sandwich" on its menu. The tasty sandwich and the 
curbside concept were so successful that other Pig Stands were opened 
throughout the United States; at its zenith, the chain was more than 100 
restaurants strong. The company logo, then and now, was the profile of a hog 
with the words Pig Sandwich stretching from ear to tail. In the latter half of 
the century, however, the business began to shrink, and today there are only 
seven Pig Stands left. All are in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Texas Pig Stands has a proud tradition. So when the Hard Rock Cafe 
opened in Dallas in 1986, Hailey was chagrined to find that it too served a 
"pig sandwich." He took the matter to court, seeking restitution for all of the 
profits that the Dallas Hard Rock had made on its version of the entree. 
</P>
<P>
The Hard Rock lawyers argued that the company's founder, Isaac Tigrett -- who 
likes his sauce hot and vinegary -- grew up in Jackson, Tenn., just a few miles 
from the barbecue mecca of Memphis. According to Tigrett's testimony, Memphis 
and other cities across the South were for years dotted with small barbecue 
shacks known to one and all as pig stands, and the sandwiches they served were 
called, generically, pig sandwiches. So he was within his rights to put the 
pair of words on his menu. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the most extraordinary cases I've ever seen," said Hard Rock 
attorney Ralph Kalish Sr. -- who doesn't even like barbecue sauce all that much 
-- "and I've been practicing law for 43 years." Kalish took depositions from 
people all over the country who testified that sticking barbecue between two 
pieces of white bread was sure enough a pig sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
The presiding U.S. magistrate, John Primomo, must have felt the weight of the 
matter as he dismissed the jury for a weekend break before deliberations. With 
great solemnity he instructed them not to talk to their families or each other 
about the case. Not to watch television. Not to read the newspapers. And, above 
all, not to eat any barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Lest you think this was an isolated incident, a quick scroll through an index 
of recent lawsuits provides a number of other juicy examples, most notably a 
$1-billion breach-of-contract suit filed against entertainer Redd Foxx in 1986. 
In the suit, Foxx was accused of backing out of an agreement to endorse a line 
of barbecue products. 
</P>
<P>
If barbecue has begun to spice up the bar, surely it's only a matter of time 
before the Southern delicacy insinuates itself into other aspects of our 
culture -- medicine, sociology, education -- so the more we know about the 
subject, the better off we'll be. To that end, perhaps the time is right for a 
college entirely devoted to the study of barbecue culture, a sort of Barbecue 
U. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the college would have to be Nashville's John Egerton, author 
of the definitive opus, "Southern Food," who knows barbecue the way Bo Jackson 
knows everything else. The deans would be Greg Johnson and Vince Staten, two 
reporters for the Louisville Courier-Journal who wrote the book on barbecue 
called "Real Barbecue." The school colors would be red and brown. The nickname 
would be the Chefs. And with no apologies to the University of Arkansas, the 
mascot would be a razorback. The course list might look something like this: 
</P>
<P>
WORLD HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
By way of introduction, President Egerton will explain to students how Spanish 
explorers discovered Indians in the Caribbean who roasted meat on wooden 
frames. The Spanish called the framework barbacoa and from that word comes the 
present-day barbecue. The reading list will include numerous treatises on pork 
preparation through the ages, including Charles Lamb's 1822 essay on roasting 
pigs. 
</P>
<P>
In his essay, Lamb speculates that barbecue was first discovered in the Far 
East when a villager's hut burned down, charring the pigs and chickens in the 
yard. The distraught villager, looking for a morsel of food, pulled the roasted 
meat from the ashen rubble and discovered that it was very tasty. Word of the 
newfound delicacy spread, and soon people throughout the land were burning down 
their houses and enjoying barbecued pigs and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
Students will learn that pork was the meat most commonly eaten by colonial 
Southerners because it was easy to preserve. But pork could get a little tough, 
so a great deal of energy was spent on the sauces that were believed to enhance 
the flavor of an otherwise unappetizing dish. 
</P>
<P>
Guest lecturers will include celebrity chef Paul Prudhomme, who once wrote that 
while growing up in Opelousas, La., he didn't know what the word rare meant 
when applied to food. "My mother never served anything that wasn't really 
cooked, because you never killed an animal that was still productive." As a 
result, when an animal finally was slaughtered on the Prudhomme farm, it was 
fairly old. And what made it tasty was the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
LITERATURE 
</P>
<P>
You've heard about people who talk about reading cookbooks the way others read 
novels. In this course students will receive credit for doing just that. The 
reading list will include works by Craig Claiborne, Julia Child and James 
Beard. Prose works by Calvin Trillin and William Faulkner, on the other hand, 
will be read as cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting poets will drop by to delight students with samples of their works. 
For instance, Roy Blount Jr. might read "Song to Barbecue Sauce" from his book, 
"One Fell Soup, or I'm Just a Bug on the Windshield of Life": 
</P>
<P>
 Hot and sweet and red and greasy, 
</P>
<P>
 I could eat a gallon easy: 
</P>
<P>
 Barbecue sauce! 
</P>
<P>
 Lay it on, hoss. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is dross 
</P>
<P>
 Under barbecue sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush it on chicken, slosh it on pork, 
</P>
<P>
 Eat it with fingers, not with a fork. 
</P>
<P>
 I could eat barbecued turtle or squash -- 
</P>
<P>
 I could eat tar paper cooked and awash 
</P>
<P>
 In barbecue sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd eat Spanish moss 
</P>
<P>
 With barbecue sauce. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 PHILOSOPHY 
</P>
<P>
A course that studies people, such as Bobby Seale, who've raised barbecue to a 
higher plane. "There was a time," wrote Seale (who believes that barbecue 
should be spelled with a q) in his book, "Barbeque'n With Bobby," "when 20 
million liberals and left radicals across the country were saying 'Free Bobby 
Seale.' Now they're grown up and have their own barbeque grills and pits in 
their backyard. This is an American pastime. I love it. Barbequing can change a 
grumpy attitude to a pleasant kind of sereneness." 
</P>
<P>
GEOGRAPHY 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Trillin was right when he said, "Barbecue is a touchy subject all over 
the country." The college hopes to foster understanding among regions by 
bringing together a group of cartographers and geographers who believe that 
America can be divided into regions according to barbecue preferences. Students 
will learn from visiting scholars that Texans barbecue beef as well as pork and 
prefer a tomato-based sauce, while North Carolinians live by pork alone and 
tend toward a sweet, vinegar-based sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Guest speakers might include University of South Carolina professors Charles 
Kovacik and John Winberry, who wrote a 200-plus-page geographic treatment of 
their state in 1988. One of the ways they divvied up the state was by pointing 
out which region uses which sauce. According to the authors, the Low Country 
loves mustard-based sauce; along the western side the sauce resembles ketchup; 
tomato-based sauce is found in the northwest; and up around Myrtle Beach the 
shag dancers go for a pepper and vinegar sauce. 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS 
</P>
<P>
Students will spend their spring term in Memphis, observing preparations for 
the Memphis in May International Festival, the centerpiece of which is the 
annual World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. This year the contest will 
draw 175 teams -- with names such as the Pot Bellied Porkers and the Porky 
Pilots, competing for $10,000 in prizes before 100,000 spectators. The real 
money, however -- more than $350,000 -- goes to the festival in the form of 
corporate sponsorships, and the citywide economic impact of the barbecue 
contest alone is about $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS 
</P>
<P>
Politics and barbecue have gone hand in hand since before the founding of the 
nation. Readings from the textbook "Real Barbecue" will include the Acts of the 
Virginia Burgesses in 1610, which forbade "the shooting of firearms for sport 
at barbecues, else how shall we know when the Indians are coming," and an entry 
from the 1769 diary of George Washington, which reads, "Went up to Alexandria 
to a barbicue. Back in three nights." 
</P>
<P>
Students will take field trips to political barbecues in most of the 50 states. 
And a barbecue lobbyist from South Carolina will explain why in 1986 his state 
legislature passed a Truth in Barbecue law, which requires barbecue restaurants 
to advise patrons how the barbecue is cooked and what parts of the hog are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC 
</P>
<P>
Guest artists will perform various renditions of Louis Armstrong's 1927 hit, 
"Struttin' With Some Barbecue," and "B.B.Q.U.S.A," written by Mojo Nixon in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
ETHNOGRAPHY 
</P>
<P>
Participants will include John Marshall, whose 1981 master's thesis, "Barbecue 
in Western Kentucky: An Ethnographic Study," is the first and last word on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Barbecue U doesn't exist yet, so in preparing to make legal war against 
Hard Rock Cafe International, Kalish Sr. had to put together his own 
curriculum. In the end, after all the depositions were taken and the issues 
presented, the jury found in favor of Texas Pig Stands. The case will probably 
be appealed, so until a final decision is reached, the pig sandwich will 
continue to appear on the Dallas Hard Rock Cafe menu. Hard Rocks outside of 
Texas, such as the Washington cafe, have not been affected by the suit. 
</P>
<P>
But for the attorneys in another barbecue lawsuit, there's still time to learn 
a thing or two. It seems that Christopher Carroll, owner of the Spring Creek 
Bar-B-Que in Arlington, Tex., has filed suit against former employee Londell 
Fisher, owner of the newly opened Stage Coach Bar-B-Que. Carroll -- who likes 
his sauce very red and a little sweet is charging that Fisher -- who also likes 
his sauce very red and a little sweet -- has stolen his recipe. "I was shocked 
and disappointed," Carroll said. "I treated him like family."

HINTS FROM HELOISE: HOW TO DRY HERBS FROM THE GARDEN AND STORE FOR FUTURE USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I'm growing an herb garden for the first time and want to dry the 
herbs and store them. What's the trick? 
</P>
<P>
 -- TOM, Sausalito, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR TOM: Harvest herbs early in the morning before the sun evaporates their 
oils. This way their flavor will remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
Wash and rinse them well and dry in a warm, dark, well-ventilated place. You 
can lay them on a screen or tie small bunches by the stems and hang them upside 
down. Drying time will depend on the thickness of the herbs. 
</P>
<P>
A microwave oven also works well. Rinse the herbs, pat dry and place several 
sprigs at a time between paper towels. Microwave on the lowest setting for two 
or three minutes or until the herbs are brittle. 
</P>
<P>
Some herbs, such as basil, mint, parsley, chives and tarragon, can be frozen, 
then thawed and used as fresh. Freeze small amounts in freezer-safe plastic 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
Store dried herbs in glass containers with tight-fitting lids and they'll keep 
their flavor for up to a year. Be sure to label and date them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I was making a lemon cake and realized the peels were still good 
after I used the juice, so I put them in plastic freezer bags and froze them. 
The next time I needed lemon peel, I just took one out, grated it and had fresh 
lemon zest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- EVA, Granite City, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I like the quickness of heating rolls and pastries in the 
microwave, but sometimes they come out hard and dry. How can I get them hot but 
still edible? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M. W., New York, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR M. W.: Tough or dry bread and rolls usually mean you've heated them too 
long. It takes only a few seconds. Put them on a paper towel to absorb moisture 
so they won't be soggy, then heat for about 15 seconds per item. 
</P>
<P>
Hope they're all edible from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Since frozen foods should be used within a certain amount of 
time, I would mark the date when I put food in the freezer, but I was always 
having to refer to my freezer chart to see what I needed to use first. 
</P>
<P>
Now I put the use by date on foods rather than the date I freeze them. This way 
I don't have to guess. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETTY, Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: After a recent back injury, I found that I couldn't stand for 
very long, which was a problem when I cooked. My husband built an additional 
kitchen counter at table height. With a comfortable chair to sit in, I can now 
cook without further stress to my back.

WEIGHT-LOSS DIETS BELIEVED HARMFUL; 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: THE INDUSTRY IS UNREGULATED AND UNTAMED, CRITICS SAY. LIQUID 
FORMULAS, ESPECIALLY, ARE CITED AS CULPRITS, BUT THEY HAVE THEIR DEFENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Dr. C. Wayne Callaway, an endocrinologist speaking on behalf of the 
American Board of Nutrition, testified at a congressional hearing on the 
weight-loss industry, he told the committee that "the weight-loss business in 
the United States has gotten out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Callaway was not alone. Nancy S. Wellman Ph.D., a registered dietitian and 
president of the American Dietetic Assn., whose 59,000 members comprise the 
nation's largest group of food and nutrition professionals, also testified at 
the hearing. "Too often the emphasis is on the pocketbook not the paunch," she 
told a subcommittee of the House Committee on Small Business. 
</P>
<P>
Because the $33 billion-a-year weight-loss industry is largely unregulated, it 
has operated like an untamed, runaway horse for decades and accountability, the 
critics believe, is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue with quick weight-loss diet programs is that they are acting on 
response to market demand," said Marsha Hudnall, a registered dietitian 
interviewed at an American Dietetic Assn. conference in Los Angeles recently. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a professional responsibility to design (diet) strategies based on 
scientific evidence. According to the guidelines of the American Dietetic 
Assn., ideal weight is based on 10 calories per pound of current weight, which 
means that a person weighing 150 pounds should consume a total of 1,500 
calories a day. Many of these programs are much lower than that with calorie 
levels anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 calories and some popular liquid diets are 
even lower, with 400 to 800 calories a day," Hudnall said. 
</P>
<P>
Wellman thinks that very low calorie diets are not for people with medical 
conditions such as active cancer, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal failure, 
cardiac dysfunction or severe psychological disturbances. "These diets should 
not be used by infants, teen-agers, pregnant and breast-feeding women, or older 
Americans," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Nutri/Systems, a portioned meal plan, Optifast, a liquid formula diet program 
and Slim Fast, a partial liquid diet program (the program involves two glasses 
of liquid formula and one meal a day) are among those being criticized for 
making use of low calorie intakes during weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stuart Shapiro, former Philadelphia commissioner of health and current 
national director of Nutri/Systems, insists that the program is medically safe. 
"We don't consider ourselves a 'fast' weight loss program," Shapiro said. "We 
provide a nutritionally balanced meal plan that meets safe calorie levels 
recommended by major health organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Medical literature is clear that weight loss programs should be tailored to 
individuals, and for many individuals 1,000 calories a day may be appropriate 
while for others 1,500 may be. Nutri/Systems is a 'comprehensive' weight loss 
and management program tailored to individual needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Weight loss of 1 1/2 to 2 pounds per week (about 1% of body weight per week) 
until ideal weight is achieved is followed by a maintenance program using 
portioned meals twice a week and continual access to nutrition classes," 
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
William Bush, senior vice president of Sandoz Nutrition/Optifast, pointed out 
that Optifast is a 15-year-old program originally developed for hospital 
treatment of the grossly obese. The program is now available primarily through 
hospital outpatient clinics and is intended for patients who are 30% 
overweight. (Obesity is categorized as being 20% above ideal weight.) 
</P>
<P>
Bush contends that Optifast has been unfairly "lumped in with storefront 
operations that do not offer the medical supervision or the comprehensive 
program to teach people how to keep weight off. Our average patient loses 45 
pounds in 26 weeks, and at the end of 18 months they have maintained (loss of) 
two-thirds of that weight." 
</P>
<P>
The data, Bush said, comes from "large multicenter trials, one involving 1,500 
patients and the other 500." 
</P>
<P>
The Optifast program can cost a patient from $2,500 to $3,000. The first 
12-week phase of the three-phase program begins with a 420 to 800 calorie 
formula diet followed by gradual introduction of "normal" foods. Behavior 
modification, exercise, lab tests and supervision by credentialed professionals 
and physicians also are provided. 
</P>
<P>
Some low-calorie diets have been useful as short-term methods for reducing 
weight in the dangerously obese and in persons with hypertension, diabetes or 
high blood levels, Callaway pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional hearing in late March was just the beginning. According to 
Callaway, the "warning has been sounded" and there are stirrings within the 
Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration for further 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"We must better define roles of the FTC and FDA in regulatory aspects of such 
diets," said Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
The hullabaloo started three months ago when 18 Florida women filed suits 
against Nutri/Systems, claiming that rapid weight loss affects bile in the 
gallbladder and contributes to the formation of gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
According to Callaway, gallbladder problems occur with "extremely high 
frequency" when people go on low calorie diets. "A study . . . published in the 
Archives of Internal Medicine showed that in eight weeks of dieting on a 500 
calorie diet 25% of dieters developed gallstones. In contrast, equally 
overweight individuals who did not diet showed no development of gallstones." 
</P>
<P>
Callaway also pointed out that many diet program promoters blame obesity and 
not the diet for obese persons' gallbladder problems. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shapiro of Nutri/Systems, there "is no evidence linking 
gallbladder disease to weight-loss programs like Nutri/Systems." 
</P>
<P>
"We will defend against (the suit) and we will prevail," said Tim Hermeling, 
public affairs director for Nutri/Systems. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive weight-loss program provides a $49 to $64 weekly food and 
beverage package for an initial 1,000 to 1,500 calorie intake per day, followed 
by a yearlong maintenance diet, adding behavior modification and education to 
the program. A Nutri/Systems nutrition specialist (not all of them registered 
dietitians or licensed practitioners) meets with the client once a week to 
monitor weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Some low-calorie commercial diet plans call for 500 to 1,000 calorie daily 
diets, which is considered lower than is safe for supplying all the nutrients 
needed for good health, according to the Recommended Daily Allowances, which 
set standards for nutrient intake. 
</P>
<P>
A position paper published in the May issue of the Journal of American Dietetic 
Assn. states that rapid weight-loss programs are recommended only for dieters 
who are at least 30% to 40% overweight. Wellman stressed that rapid weight loss 
should be undertaken only with the supervision of a qualified health team. "The 
most significant drawback to an unsupervised very low calorie diet is the 
potential for life-threatening side effects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Loss of body protein may affect cardiac function and could be related to heart 
failure. . . . Eventually all dieters need to learn to be realistic about their 
food choices," Wellman said. 
</P>
<P>
Callaway, who practices internal medicine, endocrinology and metabolism in 
Washington, where he is also associate clinical professor of medicine at George 
Washington University Medical Center, expressed similar concerns to the 
committee: "If you are going to engage in something potentially hazardous you 
need to have people who know how to intervene." 
</P>
<P>
Callaway cited the case of some 60 people who had died in the mid-1970s shortly 
after discontinuing their liquid protein diets. Sudden deaths, he said, still 
occur. "The fact that we have not heard about them until recently reflects our 
lack of any type of tracking mechanism. We have no way of knowing how common 
these occurances are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the diets out there, Callaway asserts, are ineffective. "Most of the 
evidence suggests that the more you lose the more quickly you gain," Callaway 
told The Times. Oprah Winfrey, who lost 67 pounds on a liquid diet plan and 
regained some of it back, is often cited as a victim of the yo-yo syndrome 
common to fast-loss weight programs. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of losing and regaining has been scientifically established 
since the early 20th Century, Callaway said. But little of the knowledge has 
been incorporated into the currently available commercial loss programs. 
</P>
<P>
Low calorie diets, Callaway explained, start out with loss of water, which then 
is retained as the body adapts to starvation. The metabolic rate slows down 
(nature's way of preserving fat in the face of starvation or famine). 
"Unfortunately, it is accompanied by symptoms that severely compromise one's 
quality of life," Callaway said. Symptoms include fatigue, depression, dry 
skin, sleeplessness, constipation, a fall in blood pressure, dizziness, 
bloating and even loss of consciousness. Some studies indicate that with each 
subsequent attempt at dieting weight loss is slower and rebound weight gain 
occurs more rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Starving also leads to stuffing and binge eating, as found among bulimia 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Callaway called for qualified supervision of weight-loss plans. At the 
congressional hearing Callaway said that many people successfully diet on their 
own if they also increase physical activity or cut back on snacks and fats. 
</P>
<P>
A second alternative is to see a registered dietitian. "There are more than 
50,000 registered dietitians who are qualified to provide dietary advice," 
Callaway said. Furthermore, rapid weight-loss plans should be restricted to 
individuals who truly need to lose weight for health reasons and who have some 
medically justifiable indication for losing weight rapidly, he said. "In all 
cases it is imperative that there be medical supervision and that the medical 
supervision be competent to monitor the types of complications that are known 
to occur. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of commercial programs in which physicians are not involved refer to 
their staff as 'certified' nutrition counselors, behavioral therapists or 
whatever. In most cases, the only certification comes from the company offering 
the program. . . . (Consumers) have no existing effective mechanism for tracing 
the incidence and severity of complications due to unsupervised and poorly 
supervised weight loss programs. At present, our main recourse is through the 
media. For the victim, the only recourse is through civil suits. Surely we can 
improve upon this situation," Callaway told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Among his other recommendations to the subcommittee: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hold weight-loss programs accountable for their diets' outcomes by 
documenting dietary complications of clients and stop blaming the dieter for 
their failure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish a registry or clearinghouse for collecting data of adverse 
effects on clients of commercial diet plans and make the information available 
to the scientific community for evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
In his recent book, "The Callaway Diet: Successful Permanent Weight Control for 
Starvers, Stuffers and Skippers," (Bantam Books: $17.95) Callaway gives reasons 
why starving, stuffing and skipping are counterproductive methods for losing 
weight. He also provides a four-step personal dieting profile that determines 
the dieters' specific weight loss challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The book first guides the dieter through a new formula for determining 
healthiest weight range and body fat distribution. Secondly, it helps define 
which diet approach will be most effective. Diet history, current metabolic 
score and eating and activity patterns are determinants. 
</P>
<P>
The menus developed are for diet levels of 1,400 calories, 1,600 calories, 
1,800 calories and 2,000 calories per day, with exercise recommended. Callaway 
considers the program a sensible approach to dieting because the calories 
provide the necessary RDA's for a balanced diet while allowing overweight 
individuals to eventually lose weight because they are eating less and 
exercising more. 
</P>
<P>
Callaway's rules for eating: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Eat three regularly scheduled meals a day and no snacks. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Don't skip meals. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Balance meals throughout the day, allowing 25% of the calories for 
breakfast, 30% to 35% for lunch and the remainder for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Drink no alcohol during the first six weeks, as alcohol is known to 
trigger bingeing. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Up to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day are allowed. Drink tea or 
coffee without sugar or artificial sweeteners as they can set off bingeing. 
Replace diet sodas with mineral water or unsweetened seltzer. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wellman, all dieters need to learn to deal with food in a balanced 
manner with variety and moderation as the keys. 
</P>
<P>
"Changing eating habits is a gradual process that requires individualization, 
ongoing monitoring and reinforcement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dietitians can play a role in helping people make permanent adjustments. "We're 
the dieters' personal cheerleader," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California registered and licensed dietitians can be located 
through a dietitians' referral hot line: (800) 297-7629.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: CHINA MAKER SETS THE TABLE FOR EARTH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expressing a conscious regard for the environment, many gourmet and table-top 
product manufacturers have joined mass activism in support of Earth Day 1990 
this Sunday. Involvement includes such steps as condensing packaging to reduce 
solid waste, committing time and money to aid antipollution projects and 
creating awareness campaigns to help revamp society's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Villeroy &amp; Boch Tableware Ltd. pursues this global issue with a "Let's Mug 
America" campaign, encouraging the public to use permanent china mugs or cups 
in place of disposable paper or plastic foam cups. "The goal is to impress upon 
Americans how a simple change of habit -- such as using a porcelain mug -- can 
make a world of difference," according to Dale Ritter, president of this 
242-year-old china company. "By vowing to give up plastic foam we can 
contribute to the future survivality of life on earth." 
</P>
<P>
The throw-away villains are not only detrimental to the ozone layer but heavily 
contribute to the heaping waste problem that researchers say is accumulating at 
a rate of 110 million tons of solid waste per year. 
</P>
<P>
The "mugging" of America program is just one of Villeroy &amp; Boch's positive 
approaches to environment in vogue. In the past the tableware manufacturer has 
raised funds for other conservation causes such as donating thousands of 
dollars to the World Wildlife Fund. The money was generated from the sales of 
its animal plate series. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of Earth Day, the company suggests pretty floral patterns in their 
porcelain collection. Besides having the benefit of holding an ample amount of 
tea, coffee, soup or other beverages and offering a sturdier quality than 
disposables, mugs come in a great range of attractive colors and designs. 
</P>
<P>
Another charming porcelain mug selection is the Botanical Mugs from 
Williams-Sonoma ($19.50). Nurturing nature, the white 11 1/2-ounce mugs are 
designed with old botanical engravings of six different European flowering 
herbs. The Hungarian-made mugs come in a set of six. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee drinking environmentalists would likely choose a tree-saving permanent 
filter for their drip coffee maker over a disposable paper filter. One of the 
companies now making the reusable version is Krups with its Gold Mesh Filter 
($20). Made in Switzerland, the permanent filters are available in a No. 2 size 
to fit most coffee makers and a No. 4 model that has an adapter ring for Krups' 
10- and 12-cup machines. 
</P>
<P>
Some paper filters, however, are environmentally sound. Last year, there was 
the chlorine-free unbleached brown filter introduced by Melitta. And now here 
comes a brand new white filter from Mr. Coffee, which is whitened using no 
elemental chlorine -- a bleaching agent that produces undesirable chemical 
by-products such as dioxin. In response to the tree-conservation effort, Mr. 
Coffee filters are made from 50% fewer trees. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the new filters is that although they make better tasting 
coffee than the regular Mr. Coffee filters, the price remains the same. The 
packaging has a more attractive design and will continue to be made of 
biodegradable recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
To assist with environmental projects, Mr. Coffee will donate one penny to 
environmental charities for each box of filters it sells between July 1 and 
December 1. 
</P>
<P>
Messages to save the earth are stated not only from actual product use but are 
etched in tableware designs as well. Artist/designer Lynda Sylvester's concern 
for environmental preservation is imprinted in three new porcelain dinnerware 
patterns that she designed for the LS Collection (from $144 a place setting). 
</P>
<P>
Her sentiment over the Brazilian rain forests inspired Rainforest, highlighted 
with a lush tropical foliage banding that's stroked with jazzy splashes of 
24-karat gold. Concerned that the universe is becoming endangered by advanced 
technologies, she created the Universe dinnerware pattern. It represents an 
abstract planetary design in a blend of midnight blue and black with 24-karat 
gold accents. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvester's Basketmaker III pattern in monochromatic black and white with 
copper colored rim will win favors from advocates of American Indian heritage. 
It's a mystical pastiche of the sun, moon, stars, mountains, clouds, animal and 
hunters -- the vital elements and rituals of ancient southwest Indian living. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeroy &amp; Boch Mugs are available at Villeroy &amp; Boch Creation shops 
(Beverly Hills) and other fine china stores. Botanical Mugs are available at 
Williams-Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Krups Gold Mesh Filter is available at Williams-Sonoma. Mr. Coffee Filter is 
available at department stores, drugstores and specialty gourmet coffee stores. 
</P>
<P>
 LS Collection dinnerware patterns are available at Tesoro's (Beverly Hills).

GROUND BEEF FAT AND LEAN CONTENT SAME IN ALL STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE STONEBACK, THE ALLENTOWN MORNING CALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although ground beef is consumed by more Americans than any other meat, about 
the only thing a consumer can be sure of is the fat and lean content of regular 
ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
Buy lean, extra-lean or super-lean ground beef and the percentage of lean meat 
(and, therefore, fat content) will vary from store to store. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, percentages won't even be marked, leaving the customer to guess how 
much fat or lean meat is contained in packages labeled simply, "ground round" 
or "ground chuck." 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Corbin, director of the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry for Pennsylvania's 
Department of Agriculture, explained, "Ground beef may not contain more than 
30% fat. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no standards for lean and extra-lean ground beef. However, under 
normal labeling interpretation and that of the law, it is fair to interpret 
that lean would have to have less fat than the store's regular ground beef and 
that extra-lean must contain less fat than the lean." 
</P>
<P>
The ground beef problem has raised the ire of at least one Washington-based 
consumer lobbying group. Bonnie Liebman, of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, said, "Never mind that no other food contributes more fat to 
the average diet. Never mind that the Surgeon General and other health 
officials have been nagging consumers to 'choose lean meat.' The fact is that 
the states don't require 'lean ground beef' to be truly lean." 
</P>
<P>
She explained, "The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 'lean' meat can have no 
more than 10% fat (by weight) and 'extra-lean' no more than 5%. But these 
policies don't apply to ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the average fat content of 'lean' ground beef sold in supermarkets 
nationwide is not 10%, it's 21. The average 'extra-lean' is not 5% fat, it's 
17." 
</P>
<P>
Liebman urged consumers to do some lobbying. She advised, "If your meat market 
doesn't display the fat content, tell the store that you and your friends want 
to know how much fat is in the ground beef you're buying. If other stores in 
the area disclose the fat content of their ground beef, make sure your store 
knows about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then write to the head of the State Department of Agriculture and urge that 
retailers be required to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restrict "lean" claims to ground beef with no more than 10% fat by weight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limit "extra-lean" claims to 5% fat or less. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prominently disclose the fat content on labels of all ground beef." 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways butchers can make sure their basic ground beef complies 
with the 70% lean standard. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin explained, "Some butchers use a pocket-sized color comparison chart that 
can be held next to ground beef to check the degree of redness. It comes pretty 
close when it comes to accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"With experience a butcher will also know if his beef is in compliance. Some 
operations also buy coarse ground beef from a USDA-inspected processing plant. 
Products from that plant will be labeled concerning the percentage of fat and 
lean. The in-store butchers then can add some trimmings from the store.

FOOD PHARMACY: OMEGA-3'S EFFECT ON ARTHRITIS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN CARPER, Carper is a medical and nutrition writer and the author of 15 
books, including The Food Pharmacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
Does eating fish oils actually help people with rheumatoid arthritis? There's 
new evidence it can, says Dr. Joel Kremer, associate professor of medicine, 
Albany (N. Y.) Medical College and a leading expert in the field. 
</P>
<P>
In his study of 49 people with rheumatoid arthritis, those taking fish oil 
daily for six months showed improvement on 24 different measurements; for 
example, they had fewer tender and swollen joints and less pain and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, according to Kremer, three other recent studies -- from Harvard, 
Australia and the Netherlands -- confirm the arthritis-fighting activity of 
fish oils. 
</P>
<P>
Fish oil acts as an anti-inflammatory agent but it also benefits the immune 
system directly, Kremer found. 
</P>
<P>
The big question for Kremer now is to find the best dosage. In his new study, 
higher doses of five or six grams of fish oil daily were more effective than 
two or three grams. Five to six grams equal seven to nine ounces of raw 
Atlantic mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, in the study, olive oil also helped relieve some symptoms of 
rheumatoid arthritis for unknown reasons. But it was not as effective as fish 
oil, says Kremer. 
</P>
<P>
When you reduce cholesterol, you may get an unexpected bonus: lower blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have long suspected a physiological connection between high cholesterol 
and high blood pressure. But how it might work was a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Now Swiss investigators have come up with a surprising new theory. On the basis 
of new studies, they claim that LDL cholesterol -- the bad type -- actually 
packs a double whammy in heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
It's already known that LDL cholesterol helps clog arteries. But Agapios 
Sachinidis, a biochemist at University Hospital, Zurich, now says LDL 
cholesterol also can act like a hormone that directly triggers rises in blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Too much salt could help destroy bones. 
</P>
<P>
That's what New Zealand researchers have found. Eating a high-sodium diet 
caused a group of nine elderly women to excrete nearly 30% more calcium. The 
calcium, therefore, was not available to be deposited in their bones. This 
could be detrimental at any age but especially to elderly women who are at high 
risk of bone fractures and the osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, researchers first put the women on a low-salt diet (1,600 
milligrams of sodium daily) then switched them to a high-salt diet (3,900 
milligrams daily). Although they ate the same amount of calcium on both diets, 
one-third more of it was eliminated from the body during the high-salt diet. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, researchers found that not only women but men tend to lose 
bone mass as they age and therefore are also vulnerable to osteoporosis. The 86 
men in the study at the Oregon Health Sciences University ate a large amount of 
calcium and took a calcium supplement. Yet they still lost bone at a 
substantial rate (2.3% a year), notably in their vertebrae.

MICROWAVE: DOUBLING A RECIPE INCREASES CHANCE FOR FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why do so many people try to double or halve microwave recipes, usually without 
ever having tried the recipes as written? They're just begging for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, scaling recipes up or down isn't a snap with old-fashioned 
recipes because all recipes -- whether developed for the microwave or more 
conventional methods of cooking -- are precise chemical formulas. Add a little 
too much of this or too little of that or fool around with the cooking times, 
and you've only yourself to blame if the recipe flops. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to successful microwaving, the best advice we can offer is this: 
Never double -- or for that matter, halve -- recipe ingredients unless the 
recipe includes specific instructions for doing so. The quantities called for 
in a recipe, the container size, the method, microwave powers and times have 
all been carefully worked out. Tamper with any one of them -- and particularly 
with the quantity of food -- and you are courting disaster. 
</P>
<P>
This said, we offer recipes for which we have worked out larger and smaller 
yields. In each instance, follow the directions to the letter. Only then can 
you expect optimum results. 
</P>
<P>
CHICKEN BREASTS MOZZARELLA 
</P>
<P>
6 boned and skinned chicken breast halves (about 1 3/4 pounds), trimmed of fat 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 cups bottled marinara sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups coarsely shredded mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
Dredge chicken in flour mixed with salt and pepper. Brown 2 minutes on each 
side in oil and butter in large heavy skillet placed over moderate heat. Drain 
on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon marinara sauce evenly over bottom of 13x9-inch oval glass ovenware 
casserole. Arrange chicken on top with thickest parts toward outside. (Recipe 
may be prepared to this point, then covered and refrigerated until about 20 
minutes before serving. Increase microwave time 2 minutes for refrigerator-cold 
casserole.) 
</P>
<P>
Cover casserole with wax paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 6 to 8 
minutes, rotating 180 degrees at half time, until chicken is tender. Sprinkle 
chicken evenly with cheese and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 2 minutes until 
cheese melts. Or to brown cheese, place dish 3 to 4 inches from heat in broiler 
2 to 3 minutes. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
For 4 servings, brown 4 chicken breast halves as directed using 1 tablespoon 
oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Reduce quantity of sauce to 1 1/2 cups, microwave 
time to 4 to 6 minutes, and cheese to 1 cup. Recipe may be prepared, start to 
finish, in 10-inch glass ceramic casserole. 
</P>
<P>
For 2 servings, brown 2 chicken breast halves as directed using 2 teaspoons oil 
and 2 teaspoons butter. Reduce quantity of sauce to 3/4 cup, microwave time to 
2 to 3 minutes, and cheese to 1/2 cup. Recipe may be prepared in 1 1/2-quart 
casserole. 
</P>
<P>
SALMON FILLETS EN PAPILLOTE WITH TOASTED ALMOND SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
4 small salmon fillets, cut 1/2-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup very finely minced toasted blanched almonds 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced chives 
</P>
<P>
Dash paprika 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
Center each fillet on double thickness of 17x12-inch wax paper. Sprinkle with 
salt, pepper and lemon juice. Unless fillets taper sharply, do not tuck ends 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Wrap fillets in wax paper, drugstore-style and arrange, not touching, on 
microwave-safe round or oval platter. Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 4 to 5 
minutes, rearranging at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Test for doneness after 4 minutes. Salmon should just flake at touch of fork. 
If not, rewrap and microwave in 30-second increments, testing after each to 
avoid overcooking. 
</P>
<P>
Combine almonds, cream, chives, paprika and salt in microwave-safe 1-pint 
measure. Cover with wax paper and microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 1 3/4 to 2 
minutes, stirring at half time, until hot, not boiling. 
</P>
<P>
Partially unwrap salmon, top with sauce, dividing evenly, rewrap and serve. 
Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
For 2 servings, wrap 2 salmon fillets (5 to 5 1/2 ounces each) in wax paper and 
microwave as directed 2 3/4 to 3 minutes. Halve sauce ingredients and microwave 
as directed, reducing microwave time to 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Unwrap salmon and 
top with sauce. 
</P>
<P>
For 1 serving, wrap 1 salmon fillet (5 to 5 1/2 ounces) in wax paper and 
microwave as directed 2 to 2 1/4 minutes. For sauce, microwave 1 tablespoon 
minced toasted almonds, 2 tablespoons whipping cream, 1 1/2 teaspoons minced 
chives and dash paprika and salt in wax-paper-covered custard cup on MEDIUM 50 
to 60 seconds. Unwrap salmon and top with sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

WINE NOTES: NEW MID-PRICE CHAMPAGNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new entrant into the sparkling wine derby is Great Western California 
Champagne Grande Cuvee. The wines sold under this brand are aimed at hitting a 
price in the market above some of the lower-end Spanish sparklers and below the 
level of most California premium wines. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting fact here is that Great Western is the same name that has been 
used by the New York-based winery that once was one of the nation's top sellers 
of sparkling wine. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western Champagne, in its heyday in the 1960s and early 1970s, sold more 
than 850,000 cases of sparkling wine, all of it produced in New York from 
locally raised grapes. The wines were not typical of French Champagne, but sold 
for much less. 
</P>
<P>
Vintners International, which acquired Great Western as well as a number of 
other brands and properties from Seagram in 1986, saw a niche in the sparkling 
wine market that wasn't occupied by many bubblies: the $8.75 price point. So it 
produced a French-method sparkling wine from Monterey County grapes, aged the 
wine 18 months in the bottle during the second fermentation and test-marketed 
it under the La Cresta label. 
</P>
<P>
However, that test market failed because the name meant nothing to most 
consumers, said a spokesman for the company, so Great Western was selected as 
the name for the brand. 
</P>
<P>
There are two wines under the program, a Blanc de Blancs made from 77% Pinot 
Blanc and 23% Chardonnay, and a Blanc de Noirs, which is 75% Pinot Noir with 
the balance white grapes. Grapes for the wines were grown in Monterey County. 
</P>
<P>
The wines are good examples of lighter-styled sparkling wines -- clean and 
typical of methode champenoise wines, with good balancing acidity so they are 
not sweet. 
</P>
<P>
In most major markets, the wines will retail for less than the suggested price 
of $8.75 and may be seen in many locations at $7 or less. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western New York sparkling wines are still being marketed and a Blanc de 
Blancs (all Chardonnay) and a Pinot-based Blanc de Noirs are both $12.50.

HOLLYWOOD BLVD. MERCHANTS PLAN TO FIGHT CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: THE NEED FOR A GREATER POLICE PRESENCE IN THE AREA WILL BE DISCUSSED 
NEXT WEEK AT AN ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Civic leaders in Hollywood are trying once again to organize a business 
crime-watch group on Hollywood Boulevard to help merchants fight the crime, 
dirt, graffiti and general decay that has plagued the area and to mobilize the 
shopkeepers into a potent political force. 
</P>
<P>
Although several previous attempts to organize the merchants into a cohesive 
group have failed, leaders of the campaign say they think they have a shot at 
success this time, partly because the seediness of the famous boulevard has 
gotten to the point where it is hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of quiet preparation, representatives of the Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce and aides to Councilman Michael Woo have scheduled an 
organizational meeting of the Boulevard Area Business Crime Watch Group for 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
They have sent out 1,300 invitations to businesses in the target area -- 
Hollywood Boulevard from Gower Street to La Brea Avenue, including a block 
north and south of the boulevard. The meeting is scheduled for April 26 at 8 
a.m., at the Musicians Institute, 1655 McCadden Place. 
</P>
<P>
Also taking part in the planning are officials in the city Community 
Redevelopment Agency, the police, several merchants and representatives of the 
nonprofit group Hollywood Economic Revitalization Effort (HERE). 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce President Larry Kaplan said the initial goal of the group 
would be not just to fight crime, but to look for ways to counter the 
perception that Hollywood Boulevard has become a dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a perception that crime is bad and that there is a lack of safety, 
which leads to the deterioration of the community," said Chamber of Commerce 
President Larry Kaplan. "People don't want to shop there or hang out there." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan noted that visitors coming to Hollywood in search of glitz and glamour 
are often appalled by the graffiti, dirt and constant presence of transients 
and other undesirables that make the area look more dangerous than it is. 
</P>
<P>
A central part of the campaign, Kaplan said, will be to lobby for more police 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Police and government officials are like everyone else, he said. "They respond 
better to organized pressure than a lone voice in the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
So far, more than a dozen shop owners have signed on. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, George Townson, chairman of Frederick's of Hollywood, said 
merchants will join the program because their businesses have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like Hollywood to get away from the seedy look it has had -- with the 
graffiti and the transient population, it has become an eyesore," said Townson. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick's Hollywood store, the flagship of its 160-outlet intimate apparel 
chain, just underwent a $300,000 face lifting. The building has been defaced 
several times since by vandals, but Townson said he plans to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel Hollywood has a lot of potential, and we want the boulevard to 
represent a better Hollywood than we have right now," said Townson. "I think we 
all want that." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Barr, operations director of the Musicians Institute, said he 
volunteered to have the first meeting at his shop because he thinks the 
boulevard is in a downward slide. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that by us getting together, we can get a process going to solve some 
of these problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD Capt. Rick Batson, the Hollywood division commander, agreed that more 
police patrols are needed in the area, but resources are limited. "They will 
get it eventually, but they will have to be patient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Batson said, cooperation among the merchants in watching for 
crime and reporting it to police will help. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Woo hailed the organization of the crime fighting group as "an 
urgently needed step" for the boulevard's merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the difficulty of organizing the group, he noted, is the 
extraordinary diversity of the merchants. They come from Iran, Israel, India, 
China, Japan, Korea and Mexico, to name just a few countries, and many of them 
speak little English. The dizzying variety of businesses and rapid turnover 
also can make it hard to get some merchants to pull their weight. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems are not new. Pompea Smith, project director of HERE, said civic 
leaders have tried many times to organize Hollywood businesses and address 
their problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Groups have formed and dissolved, but we have never been able to get the 
groups to congeal," said Smith, whose group uses funds from the city's 
Community Development Department to improve Hollywood's commercial corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Smith characterized the new proposal as being "a valiant effort and a good 
effort. It might take longer than we think to get our goals accomplished, but 
it is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, Kaplan and others say they will follow the lead of some neighborhood 
crime watch groups in the area, who at first tackled crime and then evolved 
into multifaceted community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The seeds are there for something to happen," said Kaplan. "Let's face it -- 
Hollywood Boulevard is the single most visible and famous aspect of Hollywood; 
millions of people from around the world come to see it every year. It's 
incumbent on us to make it better."

REPORT SAYS COMPTON CAN AFFORD HIKE IN TEACHER PAY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A STATE FACT-FINDING PANEL SAYS THE DISTRICT ENGAGED IN 'DELIBERATE 
DECEIT' IN CLAIMING THAT IT FACES A DEFICIT THIS YEAR.

<P>
A state fact-finding report says the Compton Unified School District, which 
claimed it is facing a $2.27-million budget shortfall this year, actually can 
afford to spend 12.2% more on teachers salaries than it is spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said district officials either engaged in "deliberate deceit" 
or were displaying incompetence by claiming that the district is facing a 
deficit this year, while showing no signs of trying to curb spending. 
</P>
<P>
The financial data submitted by the district was "irreconcilable" with the 
district's spending habits, according to the report, which was written by 
attorney Joe H. Henderson, a Santa Rosa arbitrator who was chairman of the 
three-member panel. The report was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the financial data supplied by the school district contained a 
number of inconsistencies that made the district's financial condition seem 
worse than it actually is. 
</P>
<P>
The district, for example, claimed that it was forced to spend its own money to 
modernize school buildings because the state cancelled a program that provided 
such financing. The state, however, did not cancel the program, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report also questioned the district's claim that it was short millions of 
dollars in two self-insurance funds. The report said school officials admitted 
that the shortfalls were only paper projections based on what might happen if 
the district lost every claim filed against it. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member fact-finding panel was formed in December at the request of 
the district, after negotiations and efforts by a state mediator did not 
resolve salary issues that have left teachers working all year without a 
contract. The impasse has been marked in recent weeks by sporadic, one-day 
sickouts by teachers at different schools. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the fact-finding panel was chosen by the teachers, another by the 
district. The chairman, Henderson, was appointed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers union leaders were buoyed by the report but acting Superintendent 
Elisa L. Sanchez called it "outrageous and irresponsible in (its) attack on the 
board, this community and the staff." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said she had hoped that the fact-finding process would help resolve 
differences between the district and its teachers. "I'm very disappointed that 
any professional member of any panel would use this process to attempt to 
discredit people and the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The district's representative on the panel, Assistant Supt. Thurman C. Johnson, 
filed a minority report that said: "It is apparent . . . the chair has placed a 
great deal of reliance on the financial data presented by the union and chose 
not to research or validate the evidence and explanations provided by the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
The report is not legally binding, but union leaders said they would use it to 
press for a favorable contract settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked for the fact-finder. . . . We expect them to live up to what the 
fact-finder has said," Muriel Brooks, president of the Compton Education Assn., 
said Tuesday after the report was released. 
</P>
<P>
"We have maintained for the last year and a half that the district has money 
and the ability to pay and we will be demanding that they pay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The union, which represents about 1,400 teachers, nurses, librarians and 
counselors in the district, was drafting a letter to the board of education 
demanding that its representatives return to the bargaining table with the 
teachers. The two parties have not met since October, said Wiley Jones, 
executive director of the CEA. 
</P>
<P>
"The district has a moral obligation to the children of this community to 
promote labor harmony," said Jones. "If the district ignores a demand to 
bargain it is going to generate more distrust and an adversarial position 
between the union and the district." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the dispute, the district has not altered its initial offer to the 
teachers -- a three-year contract with 6% raises each year. The teachers, 
however, want a comprehensive revision of the pay scales to favor experienced 
teachers over entry-level teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The union claims that the district is deliberately trying to drive experienced 
teachers out of Compton so that new, lower-paid teachers can be hired. Last 
year, 154 teachers left the district to seek higher-paying jobs elsewhere. The 
union says a similar flight will occur next year if the district does not agree 
to raise pay for experienced teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The district," said the report, "has been compelled to increase the starting 
salaries to attract new teachers." Raises for experienced teachers, however, 
have been lower overall, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the union proposal, which was essentially supported by the fact-finding 
report, the salary of a teacher with about 14 years of experience would go from 
about $37,000 to about $45,000. The salary of a starting teacher would go from 
$23,226 to $24,155. Teachers would get different percentage raises, depending 
on their level of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the salary cost to the district would be a 12.2% hike this year. The 
fact-finding report recommended a two-year contract that would include a 7.5% 
across-the-board raise next year. The union was asking for a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The fact-finding report said Compton teachers are among the lowest paid in the 
county. According to the report, for example, the maximum salary for a Compton 
teacher is $37,575, while the average for the top 10 districts in Los Angeles 
County is $44,569.

CITY REJECTS OVERNIGHT PARKING RESTRICTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
STREETS: THE COUNCIL VOTES 3 TO 2 TO SCRAP A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL THAT WOULD 
HAVE REQUIRED CAR PERMITS FOR OVERNIGHT GUESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Glendale City Council has abandoned a proposed late-night parking ban that 
had triggered heated community opposition during a yearlong review. 
</P>
<P>
Council members on Tuesday listened to a dozen speakers repeat familiar 
complaints that the parking proposal, aimed at reducing congestion on city 
streets, would be inconvenient, expensive to enforce and an invasion of privacy 
for those who would need to obtain parking permits for overnight guests. They 
then voted 3 to 2 against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a response to the people who have come before us today," 
Councilman Carl Raggio said. "My feeling is that we're not ready for an 
ordinance" to restrict late-night parking. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio said that instead of passing a new, restrictive parking ordinance, the 
city should do a better job of enforcing existing parking laws and increase the 
fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 5, the Glendale Parking Commission voted 3 to 2 to support a late-night 
parking ban. On Tuesday, the council reviewed the commission's report and a 
draft ordinance to implement the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Raggio, Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg and Mayor Larry Zarian voted not to 
proceed. Councilmen Jerold Milner and Richard Jutras voted for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's politically feasible," said Bremberg, referring to the 
vocal opposition to the parking plan expressed at public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
During one hearing last year before the Parking Commission, police in riot gear 
held back an angry crowd that was trying to force its way into an already 
filled auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg said she was skeptical that fines and permit sales would cover the 
cost of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would have banned on-street parking in Glendale between 2 a.m. and 
6 a.m. Households with no off-street parking would have received up to two free 
permits annually, exempting them from the ban. Residents could have obtained 
from the city up to 30 free daily guest permits per year. 
</P>
<P>
A city staff report estimated that the plan would cost about $1.1 million 
annually to implement citywide. The staff also estimated that the plan would 
generate $1.8 million from fines at $14 per ticket and from charges for extra 
permits, which were to cost $40. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the parking ban was proposed only for south Glendale, where a large 
number of apartment and condominium complexes exist, many with an insufficient 
number of parking stalls or garages. But when south Glendale residents accused 
the city of discrimination and unfair taxation of lower-income families, the 
proposal was revised to apply citywide. 
</P>
<P>
That triggered an outcry from north Glendale residents, who complained that 
they would be inconvenienced by the permit system, even though there were no 
parking problems in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said Wednesday that the final proposal went too far. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it's not necessary at this point to have a citywide parking ban," he 
said. "The majority of the city has no need for an overnight parking ban. We do 
have problems in some areas, but we need to enforce the laws we have and to 
encourage our citizens to park in the stalls and parking garages they have." 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said residents also must be encouraged to turn in property owners who 
are illegally using their garages for other purposes or are renting parking 
spaces to people who do not live in the complex. In addition, he said, the city 
must force builders of new apartments and condominiums to include more 
off-street parking. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he contacted police chiefs in two cities that have late-night 
parking bans and was told that the measures are "a nightmare" to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Milner and Jutras proposed that the city proceed with the parking ban but limit 
it to a test area, where enforcement problems could be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Milner argued that Glendale's parking problems will only worsen as the city's 
population continues to grow. "This may not be the absolute solution, but it is 
an attempt to anticipate a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Milner's motion to proceed with the ban was defeated, other council 
members said it is unlikely to be revived in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
After the council meeting, Marilyne Wiechmann, a parking commissioner who voted 
for the ban, said she had no regrets about taking part in the emotionally 
charged hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very worthwhile experience," she said. "It's made people aware that 
we're looking at this situation. We did our job."

RESIDENTS ORGANIZE TO FIGHT PLAN TO BUILD HOUSES ON HILL; 
</P>
<P>
GLENMORE CANYON: AREA HOMEOWNERS FORM AN ASSOCIATION TO HAVE MORE CLOUT IN 
OPPOSING A PLAN TO BUILD UP TO 61 HOUSES SOUTH OF MOUNTAIN STREET AND WEST OF 
THE GLENDALE FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Angry Glenmore Canyon residents formed a new homeowners association Tuesday 
night to oppose a plan to build up to 61 houses in a hillside area immediately 
north of their Glendale neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Homes by Polygon, based in Laguna Niguel, is seeking city approval to build the 
subdivision on 29 acres south of Mountain Street and west of the Glendale 
Freeway. Polygon also developed the 550-home Rancho San Rafael community just 
east of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal is undergoing an environmental review and must be approved by 
the Glendale Planning Commission and City Council before construction can 
begin. But about 150 nearby residents, who fear that the project will destroy 
scenic hillsides and aggravate traffic and school overcrowding, vowed Tuesday 
to challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
"I object to this," resident Ruth Walsh said. "It's been like living in the 
country here, and now they're going to carve it up." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who attended the meeting in the Glendale Academy auditorium 
signed up to join the new Glenmore Canyon Homeowners Assn. They said an 
association will give them a more powerful voice in opposing Polygon's project 
during the city's review. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it should make an impact on what they plan to do," said Salvador Wong, 
a 20-year resident of Glenmore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a city planner and leaders of other Glendale homeowner 
groups spoke about the review process, the history of the Polygon project and 
the influence an association can have. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned some things I didn't know before," said television documentary 
producer Rob Sharkey, a Glenmore Canyon resident who organized Tuesday's 
meeting. "I think we put an end to a lot of rumors and innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the meeting, Marlene Roth, the developer's planning 
consultant, said she believes that many of the residents' fears are groundless. 
</P>
<P>
"With any new development, there's always reason to be concerned," she said. 
"But the degree of concern and the issues these people are concerned about are 
based on a misunderstanding of what the project actually proposes." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Glenmore Canyon and adjacent College Hills have complained that 
the new Polygon houses will increase traffic in their neighborhoods. But Roth 
said the Polygon project will be a distinct community with no direct traffic 
links to the nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things people are most concerned about is traffic, so we 
consciously developed an alternative that would take traffic off of Mountain 
Street," she said. "It'll be a separate neighborhood. It won't be intersecting 
with College Hills or Glenmore Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Glendale residents have become increasingly vocal in opposing 
residential developments that they believe mar the city's scenic slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of such concerns, the Glendale City Council in February approved an 
18-month ban on new hillside housing subdivisions. During this period, the 
council will consider new hillside development guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Polygon project, however, was one of a handful excluded by the council 
because its environmental review was already under way. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Polygon land was purchased from Glendale College through a public 
auction that drew three bids. 
</P>
<P>
The Tensor Group of Glendale submitted a high bid of $2.55 million in August, 
1988. Tensor consulted Glendale officials about preliminary plans for 15 to 24 
houses on the site, said Haik Vartanian, chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"The city didn't really know what they wanted to see developed on that hill as 
to the number of homes, or whether they would allow it to be developed at all," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because city approval was so uncertain, Tensor withdrew its offer to buy the 
land in December, 1988, Vartanian said. 
</P>
<P>
William F. Taylor, the college's business services coordinator, said Tensor 
also expressed worries about an earthquake fault discovered at the site. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Tensor withdrew, the next highest bidder, Urbatech, was no longer 
interested, Taylor said. The property was then sold to Polygon, which had 
submitted the third-highest bid, $2.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Polygon consultant Roth said the developer has submitted two plans for the 
site. One calls for 47 houses with 9.9 acres of open space, and the other calls 
for 61 houses with 6.5 acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
The houses would likely be priced at close to $1 million each, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
The project would require cutting into some of the hillsides and filling in a 
canyon area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
James Glaser, a Glendale city planner, told residents at Tuesday's meeting that 
a new report indicates that the earthquake fault cited by Tensor does not run 
through the proposed subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
He told the residents that they will have a chance to comment on the project 
during public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City Council. One 
resident asked Glaser about the odds that the new association can halt or 
reduce the scope of the Polygon project.

SISTER SAYS SHE DIDN'T KNOW OF RECLUSE'S RICHES 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 89-year-old sister of a reclusive, penny-pinching multimillionaire from 
Long Beach testified in federal court this week that she never knew him to have 
a checking account or even use credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very thrifty person. He held onto his money," Nancy Bainbridge said, 
referring with a chuckle to her late brother, Everett Reiten, who died last 
year in a Wisconsin nursing home at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me $50 for my birthday and $50 for Christmas -- no large amount. I 
didn't want large amounts," said Bainbridge, who was flown from a remote corner 
of Wisconsin to Los Angeles to testify this week in the U.S. District Court 
trial of Willard R. Walls Jr., a former Long Beach stockbroker accused of 
diverting more than $400,000 from Reiten's stock accounts over about three 
years. Walls faces varied securities and mail fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Bainbridge, stooped but lively, recited dates and details about Reiten without 
pause. She said she had no idea that her brother was a millionaire until his 
wealth was mentioned last year on a network TV show about unclaimed fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever was a private person," she said. "He minded his own business." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Reiten's stocks soared in worth to as much as $16 million, but 
he lived the life of an impoverished recluse, keeping his wealth a secret and 
spending as little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to his native Wisconsin at age 85, he lived with Bainbridge and 
her husband, renting their upstairs apartment for $75 a month. They had no 
phone, so when Reiten made calls, he had to walk down the street to a pay 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"He had me pick up quarters at the bank, so he had them for his calls," 
recalled Bainbridge, who was brought into court in a wheelchair but climbed 
into the witness stand on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Reiten moved to Long Beach from the Midwest in 1930 but did not return to 
Wisconsin for a visit until 1953, Bainbridge said, adding that he returned to 
his hometown regularly after that. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that Walls -- Reiten's stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, 
Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith -- took advantage of Reiten's eccentric habits by 
having Reiten's account statements mailed to Walls' Huntington Beach home, 
forging Reiten's signature to various documents, then siphoning money from 
Reiten's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Walls has acknowledged moving some of Reiten's money into accounts held in the 
Walls' and his wife's name but said he made the transfers because he did not 
know where Reiten was and wanted to protect the money from seizure by the 
Internal Revenue Service, which was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
unpaid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In statements to investigators last year, Walls, 66, portrayed Reiten as a 
Howard Hughes-like character who traveled extensively out of the country, had 
no known address and prized his privacy above all else. He said his only 
contact with Reiten was through infrequent phone conversations, when Reiten 
would call and give him instructions about his stock portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
In other conversations with investigators, Walls said Reiten had lived with him 
in Huntington Beach for a time in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But Bainbridge testified Tuesday that Reiten was in Bayfield, Wis., from 1982 
until his death and "didn't travel at all." She also said that in 1987 and 1988 
-- when Walls has said he was being phoned by Reiten -- Reiten made no phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
When Merrill Lynch discovered that Reiten's account statements were being 
mailed to Walls' Huntington Beach home, they began an investigation, fired 
Walls and made abortive attempts to find Reiten. 
</P>
<P>
Reiten's money was placed in a conservatorship with the Orange County Public 
Guardian's Office, and Reiten was declared a missing person. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Reiten's relatives saw the network TV show about unclaimed 
fortunes and contacted Merrill Lynch on Reiten's behalf that officials 
discovered where Reiten was. He died a few months later, in August 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the guardian's office dissolved the conservatorship and 
transferred the estate to Bainbridge and a nephew, the prospective heirs. The 
estate is in probate. 
</P>
<P>
Walls flew to Wisconsin and visited Reiten in a nursing home last summer, a few 
months before he died. He also talked to Bainbridge, who testified that she 
then told Walls that "he could get in serious trouble over this. He said that 
was so, but he would take the blame."

TEACHERS, PARENTS SEEK ROLE IN MAKING DECISIONS AT MARSHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the nearly 60-year history of John Marshall High School, its community has 
rallied to save its elaborate buildings from demolition and its teachers have 
worked for curriculum improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But not until now, say Marshall's teachers, parents and community members, have 
they had an opportunity to share in major decision-making about how the school 
is run. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, parents of Marshall students may be told that a committee of teachers 
and parents will ask the Los Angeles Unified School District for permission to 
overhaul Marshall's decision-making structure. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of saying, 'Come and be involved in PTA,' we're going to say to 
parents, 'Come and be involved in the finance committee. Come and be involved 
in staff development,' " said John Brown, parent of two Marshall students and a 
member of the school's shared-decision-making council, a group of teachers, 
parents, community leaders and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed restructuring is the second part of a process created after May's 
teachers' strike, which produced contracts that gave more decision-making power 
in schools to teachers, parents and the community. 
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, Marshall formed a shared-decision-making council that 
shares responsibility with the school's principal in five areas: continuing 
education programs for teachers, student discipline, scheduling of final exams 
and other events, spending of certain funds, such as lottery income, and use of 
school equipment, such as the photocopy machine. The decisions are made by 
consensus, with a vote taken only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the process -- school-based management -- will broaden the 
areas in which the council, teachers, parents and the community may share 
decisions with top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The request the council is likely to make tonight is for permission to apply 
for school-based management. Schools that make the request will learn by April 
27 if they will be allowed to submit specific proposals. A district Central 
Council will review the proposals and by August will name 70 schools where the 
restructuring will be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's 140 teachers were scheduled to vote late Wednesday on whether to 
approve submission of the request to the district. Teacher representatives 
indicated that the request was likely to garner the two-thirds approval needed. 
Parents will be informed tonight about the outcome of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall, restructuring of districtwide guidelines into specific, local 
policies is essential, teachers and parents said. The school is diverse: About 
half of the students are Latino, with the other half a mixture of Anglos, 
Armenians, Asians, Koreans and others. About 85% of the students live in homes 
where English is not the primary language. Some students come from low-income, 
immigrant families from Silver Lake; others come from affluent neighborhoods in 
Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring through school-based management could address the needs of a 
diverse student body and bring gradual but fundamental changes in the way that 
the school is run, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's request to apply for school-based management states that it will use 
its restructuring to address academic achievement, attendance, dropouts and 
acute student crises. 
</P>
<P>
But the specific proposal, due by June 15, could request permission to overhaul 
the way that the school is run. Shared-decision-making councils could take over 
responsibility for such issues as teacher hiring and curriculum. Even decisions 
dictated by contracts or district policy could be changed if a school's request 
to do so is approved by the Central Council, said Shel Erlich, a district 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It could mean anything," said Deborah Leidner, Marshall's principal. "It's 
almost a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to prove that restructuring works, teachers and 
administrators at Marshall said they are hopeful that power-sharing can curtail 
the school's most widespread problems: 
</P>
<P>
* Attendance -- on an average day, about 300 to 400 of the school's 2,900 
students are absent, according to counselor Barbara Knight. 
</P>
<P>
* Dropouts -- the rate has been as high as 46%, according to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
* Academic achievement -- the school is widely known for winning the national 
academic decathlon in 1987, and this year won local fame when a mock trial team 
took second place in a national competition. But those associated with the 
school said restructuring may allow them to better address the needs of 
students who speak little or no English, have after-school jobs or are liable 
to fail or drop out. 
</P>
<P>
It could also affect relationships between those who run the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers want school-based management to give them an equal voice" with 
administrators and the principal, said Knight, the teachers union 
representative at the school. "In the end, it should make their lives much 
easier because they won't have to bear the load alone." 
</P>
<P>
Leidner became principal of Marshall in August after Don Hahn retired and after 
negotiations with the district produced the new shared-power structure. Knight 
said she believes that Leidner, like other principals, may be reluctant to give 
up power. But Leidner said she welcomes the change. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential here for making this school a better place is awesome, but it's 
a shared responsibility," she said. "We want everyone to feel a part of it. 
It's not going to work if people don't feel it's theirs." 
</P>
<P>
That is an issue at Marshall and throughout the district. Parents have 
complained that teachers have a greater voice on the council and thus are able 
to advance their specific interests, Erlich said. 
</P>
<P>
Under United Teachers-Los Angeles' contract with the district, half of the 
shared-decision-making council's members must be teachers. Knight said many 
parents participate in council subcommittees, but only four serve on Marshall's 
16-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel we're adequately represented," said Brown, executive director of 
the Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. "If we are selected as one 
of the 70 sites for restructuring, we have the option of reconstructing the 
council itself. I would like to see more parental involvement." 
</P>
<P>
That is not the only change that could be made to the council. Its present 
membership -- mostly Anglos -- does not reflect the ethnic diversity of the 
school, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's council, elected last summer, has made positive if only minor 
changes in school operations, its members said. It has scheduled a staff 
development seminar in May on gangs, changed final exam schedules and examined 
student discipline guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
But members acknowledge that their responsibility has been limited and that the 
council structure has not given them as much power as they anticipated. They 
thought that they could approve or disapprove certain school activities; 
instead, they have power only to change scheduling of such events, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by some teachers to eliminate homeroom -- a brief period early in 
the school day when teachers record students' attendance -- is in arbitration 
between UTLA and the district because teachers were told that they could not 
make the decision, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they have also been restrained by their lack of experience 
with the issues and the need to reach consensus. But, they said, they have not 
yet been forced to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing when you have 16 people at the table. Sometimes a choice of a 
given word can be very significant," said Paul Michael Newman, a council member 
who lives in the community but is not a parent. "It doesn't mean we ultimately 
come up with the Magna Carta. But for those of us who think schools have been 
stifled by a top-heavy bureaucracy, this gives us a chance at the local school 
site to be more dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Marshall said teachers and the community have historically 
been vocal about their roles at the school. When officials in the mid-1970s 
threatened to tear down the school's elaborate buildings because they did not 
meet earthquake standards, those groups waged a 10-year battle and the 
buildings were renovated, Leidner said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's teachers had an instrumental role in last year's negotiations, those 
close to the school said, from circulating petitions on issues to demanding 
better access to the school's photocopy machine. Much of the effort was 
initiated by Helen Bernstein, a Marshall counselor who, as a UTLA officer, led 
last year's districtwide effort to demand more power for teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
But until the shared-decision-making council was established, teachers and 
parents had no real power, she and others said. Committees that discussed 
curriculum or certain funds could merely make suggestions to top administrators 
or make partial decisions that could be vetoed by the principal. 
</P>
<P>
That may change if Marshall is chosen to implement school-based management. 
</P>
<P>
"This could mean a whole new ballgame," Brown said. "If we can be more creative 
in managing what we've got, we should be able to produce better educated 
students and more graduates."

Los Angeles County officials will open bids May 8 on the first of two drainage 
projects planned in Pacific Palisades, a spokesman for Supervisor Deane Dana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The project calls for the placement of 2,500 feet of reinforced concrete pipe 
between Capri Drive and the Santa Monica Canyon channel near Sunset Boulevard, 
spokesman Dennis Morefield said. Work is expected to begin in July and be 
completed by December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for a second, 3,900-foot segment in the area north of Capri Drive to 
be installed later, he said.

SEVERANCE PAY BENEFIT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 2 to increase City Manager Paul Brotzman's 
severance pay from six to nine months if he is dismissed from his position with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The severance protection, part of a benefits package, was granted in part 
because Brotzman had not requested a pay increase this year. Brotzman was hired 
by the city in 1985. Councilman Paul Koretz, who voted against the provision, 
said that nine months severance is "too long."

BROKEN SPRINKLER SYSTEM CLOSES COURT FOR HALF OF DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal proceedings resumed Wednesday after being washed out Tuesday morning 
by a broken sprinkler system on the top floor of the Compton Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like it was raining in here," said Michele Watson, a secretary who 
works in the seventh-floor offices of the Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Superior Court branch and the Municipal Court are housed in the 
building, which was evacuated and closed at noon, although the breach in a 
sprinkler system reservoir occurred early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
When the water first began seeping through the top floors, arraignment 
proceedings were moved to the basement. But the fire marshal eventually ordered 
the facility closed.

<P>
One of Magic Johnson's shoes and a daylong term as Culver City police chief 
will be on the auction block Saturday at the Culver City Education Foundation's 
annual fund-raiser for the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Other items at the Nibbles &amp; Bids auction include Beverly Hills Country 
Club memberships, a hockey stick autographed by members of the Los Angeles 
Kings, the chance to serve as a school principal or Culver City's chief 
administrative officer for a day and a ride on a float in the city's winter 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Hatfield, a vice president at MGM/UA Distribution Co. and a member of many 
Culver City community and civic groups, will be honored at the auction and 
dinner event. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit foundation raised about $50,000 for the Culver City Unified 
School District last year, said Nibbles &amp; Bids co-chairwoman Roberta 
Leavitt. The funds are used for teacher grants, operation of the libraries, and 
art, music and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday night event will be held at the Filmland Corporate Center, 10000 
Washington Blvd. Tickets, at $60 each, can be purchased by calling the

GOURLEY NAMED MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chair and nameplate switching marked Tuesday's City Council meeting, as 
Councilman Steven Gourley replaced Jozelle Smith as mayor, and outgoing 
Councilman Richard Alexander stepped down to make way for newly elected Mike 
Balkman. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has served as mayor for the past year, and Balkman, president of an 
electrical contracting company, won seats on the council in last week's 
municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
Gourley, a lawyer, was chosen by the rest of the council to serve as mayor, 
which is a one-year rotating post. He has been a councilman since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander was honored with letters and proclamations from the council, city 
department heads, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. The 16-year councilman, in turn, praised the city management as 
"absolutely top-drawer." 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that a major problem is the physical load on a city 
councilman who holds another full-time job. He suggested that the city should 
look into reducing the council's workload or increasing the number of council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who was also vice mayor for the past year, decided not to run for 
another term for personal reasons. Paul Jacobs was selected as the new vice 
mayor.

FATE OF LANDMARK CLINIC TO BE DISCUSSED AT MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preservationists and developers will sit down next week for what could be the 
last attempt to save the 60-year-old Harriman Jones clinic from demolition as 
time runs out for the landmark building where, some say, half of Long Beach was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members encouraged the meeting in an effort to end a 1 1/2-year 
standoff over plans to turn the elegant Spanish-style building at Cherry Avenue 
and Broadway into a 45-unit condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists want the entire building saved, a demand the Terry/Nikols 
Development Co. says is financially impossible. The developers have agreed to 
preserve the Cherry Avenue facade and small portions of the interior if the 
City Council will allow the condominiums to stand 15 feet higher than the 
neighborhood currently allows. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have taken a hard preservation line since the building was 
declared a landmark last June. But that status only protects the clinic through 
July 4, possibly longer if a six-month extension is won. 
</P>
<P>
After that it is wide open for destruction, a fate that council members -- 
still haunted by the ghosts of the Pacific Coast Club and the Jergins Trust 
Building -- clearly want to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"We end up with a scrape, then everybody stands next to a vacant lot and says 
we coulda, shoulda, woulda," District 7 Councilman Ray Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationist Rae LaForce encouraged the city to look for another buyer who 
will leave the clinic intact. But council members worried that asking too much 
would only yield another hole in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The closed-door session to discuss the issue is scheduled for 5 p.m. Tuesday at 
City Hall. The council plans to take up the issue again May 1.

LONG BEACH OFFICIALS, BUSINESSMEN GET SECURITY TIPS AT POLICE SEMINAR;

LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE ONE-EVENING EVENT IS PRAISED BY THOSE WHO ATTENDED BUT IS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The evening fare included hot dogs and hamburgers, a SWAT team demonstration 
and tips on mail bombs and kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
The guests were public officials and business executives, gathered at the Long 
Beach Police Academy for a first-ever Executive Protection Seminar conducted by 
the Police Department earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Commissioner George Talin fired a gun for the first time since 1954, 
Councilman Clarence Smith got lessons in home security and Harbor Bank Chief 
Executive Officer Jim Gray brushed up on the do's and don'ts of hostage 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd do it again," said Talin, who hung his bullet-torn target in his office 
for several weeks after he pumped it full of holes at the firing range. 
</P>
<P>
The one-evening seminar, held in February, has been praised by those who 
attended, criticized by some who did not and defended by the police 
administration as a logical extension of the department's crime awareness 
programs for businessmen and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"It went very well, so we're probably going to put together another one," 
Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley said last month. 
</P>
<P>
The department has never before staged such a seminar, nor was Binkley aware of 
other police departments that have arranged one for their community leaders. 
The idea for the evening session arose in reaction to the mail-bomb killings of 
a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer in the South last winter, Binkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As Smith, the only council member to attend, said: "We deal with people's 
problems, and everyone doesn't always agree with us." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the seminar was held at a politically sensitive time, when the police 
administration was engaged in a heated labor confrontation with the police 
union, and union-backed City Council candidates were beginning to take swipes 
at the police administration. 
</P>
<P>
The timing raised the question of whether police management was trying to curry 
favor with community leaders, a contention that Binkley curtly dismisses. 
</P>
<P>
"It just developed, why not?" Binkley said of the program, angrily suggesting 
that the police union was trying to make an issue out of the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley said various public officials and business people were invited -- about 
40 individuals with whom the department has worked and "who've been supporters 
of police management." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that about 15 people showed up, including the spouses of those 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley said he did not know how the next group of invitees would be chosen, if 
another seminar is held. The program cost very little, Binkley said, because 
the SWAT team's appearance was part of a regular exercise and most of the 
police officers at the program were at the staff level and thus not paid 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of a selective invitation list troubled some. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds very elitist," said Larry Davis, a member of the Public Safety 
Advisory Commission, which advises the City Council on public safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's use folks to fight crime in Long Beach and put cops on the beat and stop 
doing all these little fancy things," added Davis, who said he was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Warren Harwood, who says he has been threatened by a neighbor, could 
not recall whether he had been invited, but he did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
"What does concern me a little bit is the fact that people in city government 
developed a special program for special people. It's, you know, going to 
possibly subject us to legitimate criticism on the basis of who's excluded." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said he saw nothing sinister about the seminar. "For a first go-round, I 
think it was very well done." 
</P>
<P>
Since attending the session, Talin said he has been more careful. "There are so 
many things to look for that I never took into consideration," such as where he 
pulls up in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to talking about security precautions, bombs, kidnapping situations 
and the like, police also allowed the executive students to fire weapons if 
they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I fired a gun I was hunting," Talin said. "It was 1954." 
</P>
<P>
He stepped onto the target range with a revolver, only to realize quickly that 
guns today are much more powerful and accurate than they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a dummy like myself has an opportunity of being extremely accurate the 
first time," said Talin, who twice hit the target in the heart.

COUNCIL EXPECTS FAST RESOLUTION ON SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Public hearings on the proposed Sport Chalet shopping center, which became the 
crucial issue in last week's La Canada Flintridge City Council election, could 
begin before June and be resolved quickly, council members said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which met Tuesday to swear in new members, scheduled a special May 
3 meeting to announce the hearing dates. The city requires that notice of 
public hearings be posted at least 20 days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The election April 10 of three council members who favor the controversial 
retail development should speed the appeal hearings and at least one councilman 
has said the hearings will be over in a month. 
</P>
<P>
"People are sick of the Sport Chalet deal," said Councilman Chris Valente. 
"They just want it out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for the construction of a 163,995-square-foot shopping 
center on 11.75 acres at Angeles Crest Highway and Foothill Boulevard. The 
$25-million complex would house the Sport Chalet store, a large restaurant, a 
market and a number of smaller shops. 
</P>
<P>
The Sport Chalet project has been the subject of a series of 15 public hearings 
by the city Planning Commission during which time many residents spoke out 
against the development, calling it too large. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted in February to approve a conditional use permit for the 
shopping center and sent the proposal to the City Council for approval. But 
after the developer filed an appeal objecting to some of the conditions set by 
the commission, the council decided to reconsider the entire proposal. On March 
19, the council voted to delay public hearings until after new council members 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development became the top issue in the city's recent election, 
which some residents called an unofficial referendum on the issue. Although all 
seven council candidates acknowledged the right of Sport Chalet owner Norbert 
Olberz to develop his property, only the three candidates who were elected gave 
the proposed shopping center a strong endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Allen, a spokesman for Sport Chalet, said he thought it would be six to 
nine months before the company would be able to break ground on the project. 
Allen estimated the construction of the retail center would take 12 to 18 
months.

CITY COUNCILS REORGANIZE, SELECT OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative bodies in area cities were reorganized in their first sessions 
after elections earlier this month. Councils picked mayors and mayors pro tem, 
and newly elected members were sworn in. In some instances, voting for the top 
council positions hinted at controversy to come, some of it carried over from 
bitter campaigns. But by and large, the meetings were mostly ceremonial and 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Councilman Robert Jamison was chosen mayor for the fourth time. Jamison 
has been on the council since 1972. Councilman Ronald H. Oliver, who has been 
on the council since 1974, became vice mayor. Veteran Councilman Jim Van Horn 
and newcomer Mary Alyce Soares were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Bell 
</P>
<P>
In Bell, George Cole, who has been on the council for six years, was 
unanimously elected mayor. Cole replaces Ray Johnson, who was not up for 
reelection. Rolf Janssen, who was elected to his second term on the council, 
will continue as mayor pro tem. Jay Price was sworn in for the ninth time as a 
council member, and George Bass was elected to his first term. Bass replaced 
George Mirabal, who retired after four years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower 
</P>
<P>
Randy Bomgaars was elected mayor and Bill Pendleton was elected mayor pro tem 
by a 4-1 vote Tuesday. Bomgaars replaced John Ansdell, who was reelected to his 
third term on the council. Pendleton, who was reelected to his second term, 
took the place of Bomgaars. Only Councilman Joe Cvetko voted against Bomgaars 
and Pendleton. He said later that he "had his own reasons" and declined to 
elaborate. Robert E. Stone, who defeated incumbent candidate Ken Cleveland, was 
sworn in to his first term. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens 
</P>
<P>
Council members unanimously elected Alan Shelby as mayor and Bob Cunningham as 
mayor pro tem in a quick and quiet ceremony Tuesday. Shelby has been on the 
council nine years, Cunningham six. Ronald Bird, who was reelected to his 
second term, and Douglas O'Leary, who began his first, were sworn in as members 
of the new council. O'Leary replaced former Mayor Roger McComas, who retired 
after 22 years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ruben C. Batres replaced Ruth R. Aldaco Tuesday night as mayor. It 
is the first time as mayor for Batres, a first-term councilman. Artemio E. 
Navarro, also a first-term councilman, was elected mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Joseph Graffio was reelected and Councilman Joseph Fregeau became mayor 
pro tem in a sparsely attended installation; Graffio and Fregeau were the only 
two members of the old council who attended. Fregeau replaces John Robertson as 
mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected council members Alex Rodriguez and Jack Cluck replaced incumbent 
Wilfred Colon, who sat on the council for four years, and Tom Thurman, who 
retired earlier this year. Colon and Robertson were both absent from the 
meeting. Colon could not be reached for comment, and Robertson said he could 
not attend for personal reasons. Both have signed a complaint with the state 
attorney general's office and the state Fair Political Practices Commission, 
alleging improper election activities by Graffio, Cluck, Rodriguez and acting 
City Manager Jack Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Gardens 
</P>
<P>
One council seat was empty Tuesday when the City Council held its 
reorganization meeting. Councilman Venn Furgeson has resigned because of ill 
health. The council has not chosen a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
However, one new member, Domenic Ruggeri, was sworn in. The council also chose 
H.M. (Lennie) Wagner as mayor. Wagner, a kennel owner, is serving her first 
term on the council. Ruggeri was elected last week. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Thomas E. Jackson, 53, was unanimously chosen by the council to be 
mayor, replacing Councilman William P. Cunningham. Jackson was first elected to 
the City Council in 1968 and has had the largely ceremonial position of mayor 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Councilman Jack W. Parks was elected mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Perez and Luis Hernandez took office Tuesday, becoming the first Latinos 
ever to sit on the City Council; Huntington Park is more than 90% Latino. 
Hernandez nominated Perez to be mayor pro tem, but the nomination died for lack 
of a second. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 people attended the organizational meeting to watch the new council 
take seats after the hard-fought campaign. Hernandez, 29, has been especially 
critical of incumbents, Councilman Jackson in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was expected to take a council seat next to Jackson, but the veteran 
councilman directed Perez into the seat, and Hernandez took a place two seats 
away. 
</P>
<P>
All the council members pledged to work together. 
</P>
<P>
"These five people are going to find a way to make Huntington Park a better 
place to live, work and play," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 
</P>
<P>
Mayor pro tem Dr. John Wible was elected mayor Tuesday night. He moved up from 
mayor pro tem and replaced former Mayor Jean Good. The new mayor pro tem is M. 
Jay Collins. Good and Gene Beckman are leaving the council. Their seats now 
belong to Richard Newbre and Diane Kane. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Piercy was elected by the City Council to be mayor for the coming year, 
replacing Larry Van Nostran. Meanwhile, Van Nostran began his fifth term on the 
council. A new member, Joe Esquival, was sworn in to replace retiring 
Councilwoman Jacqueline Rynerson. 
</P>
<P>
Piercy, 58, is principal of Long Beach Poly High School. He was mayor in 
1974-76, then left the council, returning in 1987 to fill an unexpired term. He 
was elected to a full term the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel E. Guillen was chosen mayor. Guillen has been on the council 
for four years. Newcomer Allen (Joe) Parker was selected vice mayor. 
Councilwoman Elvira (Vera) Amaro was officially sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Rivera 
</P>
<P>
The new mayor is Alberto Natividad. He succeeded John Chavez. Garth Gardner

ANTIQUE RECORDINGS TURN DENTIST'S HOME INTO A WAX MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDYE HODER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the compact disc era, people who talk about spinning some old records 
usually mean breaking out the big vinyl LPs. 
</P>
<P>
But when Michael Khanchalian, a 34-year-old dentist, hankers to listen to a 
bygone tune, he gingerly slips a wax, cylinder-shaped record from a cardboard 
box. Next, he cranks up one of his many turn-of-the-century phonographs, 
attaches an oversize, goose-neck brass or wooden horn to the machine and gently 
sets down the stylus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is beyond nostalgia," said Khanchalian, sitting in the den of his 
Monrovia home, listening to some of the first records ever produced. "I don't 
collect them because I remember Teddy Roosevelt or Sarah Bernhardt. I do it to 
resurrect the sounds of the past -- to make history come alive." 
</P>
<P>
Wax records, invented by Thomas Alva Edison, were first produced commercially 
in 1890 and manufactured as late as 1929. Two of the most famous songs recorded 
on wax were "A Bicycle Built for Two" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow fanciers of the records, known as cylinders, say Khanchalian has one of 
the best collections anywhere. They praise him for using his dentistry skills 
to repair the delicate cylinders for collectors around the country, thus 
helping to preserve a dying medium. 
</P>
<P>
The wax records are about the same size and shape as the cardboard tube inside 
a roll of toilet paper. To play them, the hollow cylinder is placed on a 
mandrel, a metal spindle. The wax record revolves at a high speed while a 
needle moves up and down on hundreds of grooves. Sound quality varies from 
muddled static to surprising clarity depending on the condition of the 
cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
Among Khanchalian's roughly 1,000 wax cylinders is a recording of Theodore 
Roosevelt giving a speech about labor laws when he was running for President 
under the aegis of the Bull Moose Party. Other political recordings -- used by 
candidates to reach a mass audience before radio broadcasts began in 1920 -- 
include cylinder-preserved debates between Democrat William Jennings Bryan and 
Republican William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Khanchalian's copious collection -- stored in cabinets and drawers in his guest 
room, living room, dining room, garage and just about anywhere else he can find 
space -- includes an 1898 cylinder of George W. Johnson, an early black 
recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a selection of vaudeville recordings made by, among others, 
comedienne Sophie Tucker in 1910. And there is a 1908 recording by early 
Oscar-winning actress Marie Dressler, who tells her audience that she is a 
"self-supporting suffragette," before launching into a raucous rendition of 
"I'm a Respectable Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Khanchalian, vice president of the California Antique Phonograph Society, which 
has about 300 members, loves to wax on about the hobby he began as a 
10-year-old boy after an aunt gave him his first cylinder. He started 
collecting seriously in 1981 and now counts two records in particular as his 
most prized possessions. One is his oldest record, an 1891 recording of Patrick 
Gilmore's military band playing "The College Song." (Gilmore was John Philip 
Sousa's mentor.) The other is one of only two recordings in existence of a 
once-popular evangelist team, Ira Sankey and Dwight L. Moody. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has one of the best vintage record collections that exists today," said 
Rick Wilkins, curator of the Olden Year Musical Museum in Duncanville, Tex. "He 
has some of the oldest records in the world." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps as important as his collection is Khanchalian's ability to repair 
the fragile wax records, worth anywhere from a few dollars to a few thousand 
dollars each. As a dentist, he has been able to transfer some of his skills, 
painstakingly filling cracks and breaks in a damaged cylinder much the same way 
he would craft a crown or fill a cavity. He even uses dental wax and the small 
silver tools of his trade to repair the records. 
</P>
<P>
"In dental school you learn to be accurate within a tenth of a millimeter," 
said Khanchalian, who practices in Pasadena. "If you are off in dentistry, the 
patient can really feel it. The same is true of the cylinders. You have to 
match up the grooves exactly right or it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, collectors across the country credit Khanchalian with saving some of 
the rarest and most valuable vintage recordings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's amazing," said Allen Koenigsberg, editor and publisher of the Antique 
Phonograph Monthly, a New York magazine with a circulation of about 2,000. 
"Before Mike started fixing these things, most people gave up on them. When 
they break, they're like a jigsaw puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins has sent some of the more important cylinders from his museum 
collection to Khanchalian for restoration. "He's the only one in the world that 
does it," Wilkins said. "He's saving historic recordings that were made in the 
1800s that otherwise would be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the old cylinders is tedious, so Khanchalian takes on projects only 
for a handful of collectors. "I try to just work on the really rare ones," he 
said. "For me, it's a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
In return for saving cherished cylinders for his peers, Khanchalian often is 
paid in the currency he loves best: another cylinder for his collection. "I 
just love early recorded sound," he said. "It's as if you were right there."

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPUTERIZED SIGN AUTHORIZED FOR COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale College Board of Trustees on Monday authorized purchase of a 
computerized sign for Glendale Community College after two major businesses 
chipped in a portion of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation Co. and Glendale Federal Bank each presented the board with a check 
for $25,000, which will go toward the $76,320 cost of the sign, to be built 
within three months by Doty Development Co. of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder will be paid for by the Glendale College Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization that supports the college. 
</P>
<P>
The 8- by 20-foot sign will be installed at Verdugo Road and Mountain Avenue. 
It will be connected by a telephone line to a campus computer, which will be 
used by school officials and student groups to program electronic messages 
about school activities. New messages will flash periodically throughout the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Messages on the existing marquee are changed manually. 
</P>
<P>
"The new sign will put an end to the endless territorial battles as to who will 
get their message on the marquee, how many letters and how long it can stay 
there," Supt. John Davitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The programmable sign was proposed by Walter Smith, dean of student activities, 
after he saw one at Cerritos College. Jim Cashion, foundation president, asked 
Glendale Federal and Carnation to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the companies will be permanently installed on the frame of the 
sign.

Photo, Flower Display in Full Bloom: Tens of thousands of flowers, from tulips 
to daffodils to roses to camellias, are on display at Descanso Gardens in La 
Canada Flintridge. "The mild weather has really been a blessing, since the 
tulips and other flowers are putting on a longer display," said Mary Ann 
Arnett, president of the Descanso Gardens Guild, which is sponsoring the 
monthlong event. Flower shows and lectures highlight the flower festival, which 
culminates with the San Fernando Valley Rose Show this weekend. Descanso 
Gardens is open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. For more information about the event,

AN EX-CANCER PATIENT'S NEW CHAPTER ON LIFE 
</P>

Paul Taylor still winces when he remembers the chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in bed so sick, and I wondered, 'Is it really worth it? Is life 
worth living?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was five years ago. Today, Taylor, 76, says he has no symptoms of the 
prostate cancer that doctors had believed would kill him within a year. His 
silver Buick sports a license plate reading "NOO LIFE." ("NEW LIFE" had already 
been taken, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
He said the doctors didn't know how hard he would fight. 
</P>
<P>
Now the retired businessman has turned his energies to establishing a Pasadena 
chapter of the private, nonprofit Wellness Community, a Santa Monica-based 
social support organization that stresses positive thinking and active patient 
involvement in battling cancer and the despair it often triggers. 
</P>
<P>
"All the doctors told me there was not much hope," said Taylor, who lives in 
Pasadena. "But there's always hope. That's the heartbeat of the whole program." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena branch, incorporated in January, 1989, as The Wellness 
Community-Foothills, this month reached the $200,000 minimum it needs to open. 
Taylor, the branch's chairman, raised much of the money through his contacts in 
the local business community. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Anne Kennedy said the facility, now occupying a cottage on 
North Madison Avenue, will open sometime this summer. There already is a 
waiting list of more than 100 people eager to participate, and more calls come 
in every day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, one of three full-time employees, said three or four psychotherapists 
will be hired to guide weekly support sessions for groups of 10 to 15. The 
program is free and open to cancer patients and their families, and the center 
will try to accommodate everybody who signs up, she said. Kennedy and the 
program director will be trained at the Santa Monica center, which provides 
social and educational services for 500 clients a week. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best-known participants in the Santa Monica program was comedienne 
Gilda Radner, who died in May, 1989, of ovarian cancer at the age of 42. 
</P>
<P>
The local branch of the American Cancer Society formally endorsed the Pasadena 
Wellness chapter last month and will refer clients there, said Richard French, 
executive director of the society's San Gabriel/Pomona Valleys unit. French, 
whose agency serves about 3,000 cancer patients, said support programs are in 
demand because statistics show that one in four people develop some form of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a huge need," he said. "They will be partners." 
</P>
<P>
He said the need has grown more acute because of population growth and 
government cutbacks in health-care funding. "It's like a black hole that's 
getting bigger and bigger," French said. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Bolton, president of The Wellness Community-Foothills and a clinical 
nurse specializing in oncology at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, 
said she has referred patients to the Santa Monica center -- sometimes as many 
as 10 a month -- since it opened in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Wellness officials stress that their program is no substitute for medical 
treatment, but they believe that a positive attitude can improve patients' 
chances for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those waiting for the Pasadena chapter to open have been attending 
sessions in Santa Monica for years. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Hunter, 37, of South Pasadena, was 27 when her condition was diagnosed 
as skin cancer. "I was crying most of the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the friendliness and caring of her group in Santa Monica helped change her 
outlook, she said. "We talk about dealing with quality of life rather than 
length. We think of doing something today rather than dwell on how much we're 
going to miss out on," said Hunter, who is undergoing immunotherapy to control 
the spread of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Krall, 45, of La Canada Flintridge was so panicked when she learned she had 
advanced breast cancer two years ago that she had trouble eating even when she 
wasn't undergoing chemotherapy. "I was sure I was going to die right away," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Krall said, "Everybody understood where I was coming from; they knew my fears, 
my sadness, my anger. You can laugh about being bald there, about getting 
nauseated and throwing up because of chemotherapy." 
</P>
<P>
At the center, she learned a technique called guided imagery to relax herself 
before chemotherapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Often I see cancer as a big red ball on fire, and I'd see the drugs as water 
putting out the fire," said Krall, who is undergoing hormone therapy in hopes 
of controlling the cancer, which has spread to her liver. 
</P>
<P>
Wellness clients also participate in social events such as jokefests and 
potlucks, and are offered lectures on biofeedback and exercise. The program 
encourages participants to study their illnesses in order to make informed 
decisions about treatment. Individual counseling is available as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he is convinced he aided his recovery by learning about his 
condition and battling the depression that came with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors tell me I'm in remission, but I say I'm cured," he said, grinning. "I 
don't believe a doctor can tell you how long you have to live. Only God can."

DENTIST RESURRECTS SOUNDS FROM THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDYE HODER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the compact disc era, people who talk about spinning some old records 
usually mean breaking out the big vinyl LPs. 
</P>
<P>
But when Michael Khanchalian, a 34-year-old dentist, hankers to listen to a 
bygone tune, he gingerly slips a wax, cylinder-shaped record from a cardboard 
box. Next, he cranks up one of his many turn-of-the-century phonographs, 
attaches an oversize, goose-neck brass or wooden horn to the machine, and 
gently sets down the stylus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is beyond nostalgia," says Khanchalian, sitting in the den of his 
Monrovia residence, listening to some of the first records ever produced. "I 
don't collect them because I remember Teddy Roosevelt or Sarah Bernhardt. I do 
it to resurrect the sounds of the past -- to make history come alive." 
</P>
<P>
Wax records, invented by Thomas Alva Edison, were first produced commercially 
in 1890 and manufactured as late as 1929. Two of the most famous songs recorded 
on wax were "A Bicycle Built for Two" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow fanciers of the records, known as cylinders, say Khanchalian has one of 
the best collections anywhere. They praise him for using his dentistry skills 
to repair the delicate cylinders for collectors around the country, thus 
helping preserve a dying medium. 
</P>
<P>
The wax records are about the same size and shape as the cardboard tube inside 
a roll of toilet paper. To be played, the hollow cylinder is placed on a 
mandrel, a metal spindle. The wax record revolves at a high speed while a 
needle moves up and down on hundreds of grooves. Sound quality varies from 
muddled static to surprising clarity depending on the condition of the 
cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
Among Khanchalian's roughly 1,000 wax cylinders is a recording of Theodore 
Roosevelt giving a speech about labor laws when he was running for President 
under the aegis of the Bull Moose Party. Other political recordings -- used by 
candidates to reach a mass audience before radio broadcasts began in 1920 -- 
include cylinder-preserved debates between Democrat William Jennings Bryan and 
Republican William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Khanchalian's copious collection -- stored in cabinets and drawers in his guest 
room, living room, dining room, garage and just about anywhere else he can find 
space -- includes an 1898 cylinder of George W. Johnson, an early black 
recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a selection of vaudeville recordings made by, among others, 
comedian Sophie Tucker in 1910. And there's a 1908 recording by early 
Oscar-winning actress Marie Dressler, who tells her audience that she's a 
"self-supporting suffragette," before launching into a raucous rendition of 
"I'm a Respectable Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Khanchalian, vice president of the California Antique Phonograph Society, which 
has about 300 members, loves to wax on about the hobby he began at 10 after an 
aunt gave him his first cylinder. He started collecting seriously in 1981 and 
now counts two records in particular as his most prized possessions. One is his 
oldest, an 1891 recording of Patrick Gilmore's military band playing "The 
College Song." (Gilmore was John Philip Sousa's mentor.) The other is one of 
only two recordings in existence of a once-popular evangelist team, Ira Sankey 
and Dwight L. Moody. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has one of the best vintage record collections that exists today," says 
Rick Wilkins, curator of the Olden Year Musical Museum in Duncanville, Tex. "He 
has some of the oldest records in the world." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps as important as his collection is Khanchalian's ability to repair 
the fragile wax records, worth anywhere from a few dollars to a few thousand 
dollars each. As a dentist, he has been able to transfer some of his skills, 
painstakingly filling cracks and breaks in a damaged cylinder much the same way 
he would craft a crown or fill a cavity. He even uses dental wax and the small 
silver tools of his trade to repair the records. 
</P>
<P>
"In dental school, you learn to be accurate within a tenth of a millimeter," 
says Khanchalian, who practices in Pasadena. "If you are off in dentistry, the 
patient can really feel it. The same is true of the cylinders. You have to 
match up the grooves exactly right or it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, collectors across the country credit Khanchalian with saving some of 
the rarest and most valuable vintage recordings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's amazing," says Allen Koenigsberg, editor and publisher of the Antique 
Phonograph Monthly, a New York magazine with a circulation of about 2,000. 
"Before Mike started fixing these things, most people gave up on them. When 
they break, they're like a jigsaw puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins has sent some of the more important cylinders from his museum 
collection to Khanchalian for restoration. "He's the only one in the world that 
does it," Wilkins says. "He's saving historic recordings that were made in the 
1800s that otherwise would be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the old cylinders is tedious, so Khanchalian takes on projects only 
for a handful of collectors. "I try to just work on the really rare ones," he 
says. "For me, it's a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
In return for saving cherished cylinders for his peers, Khanchalian often is 
paid in the currency he loves best: another cylinder for his collection. "I 
just love early recorded sound," he says. "It's as if you were right there."

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: 'REHAB RADIO' IS SOCIAL THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you're in the hospital, the outside world can sometimes seem a thousand 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
That's especially true for long-term rehabilitation patients, who often spend 
weeks or even months as inpatients undergoing therapy for strokes, brain 
injuries or other major problems. For patients who have trouble moving or 
communicating, the isolation is compounded. 
</P>
<P>
But at St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton, rehab patients 
have a way to reach beyond the walls and make new friends without interrupting 
therapy. It's called Rehab Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"CQ, CQ, CQ, 10 meters, Whiskey Delta Six Bravo Poppa Tango," says volunteer 
April Moell, enunciating clearly into the microphone she's holding. Behind her 
is an amateur radio transceiver; in front of her is a roomful of patients in 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
"CQ is like, 'I'm seeking you,' " Moell explains. "It's kind of like fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, before anyone has a chance to shy away, she moves around the room with 
the microphone like an amateur radio Oprah Winfrey, making sure everyone has a 
chance to try. By the time all the CQs have been spoken, responses are coming 
in so fast they're overlapping, and Moell hurries to write down all the call 
letters she can. 
</P>
<P>
"We've attracted a crowd," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's a bright sunny afternoon in Fullerton, and apparently other atmospheric 
conditions are favorable as well. "Yesterday we couldn't even talk next door, 
let alone to California," says the voice that comes through the radio. Her name 
is Pat, and she's in Virginia. "It looks like we're finally going to get some 
sunshine here today," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Moell gives the rehab patients a chance to introduce themselves. For some, like 
Viola Grace, it isn't easy. She suffered a stroke a few weeks earlier, and 
although she has improved since she arrived at the hospital, she still has 
trouble speaking her name. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi . . . la," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi-O-la," Moell tells her. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi-O-la," she repeats into the microphone, much clearer this time. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime amateur radio enthusiast, Moell founded the St. Jude radio program 
11 years ago when a local widow donated her late husband's ham equipment to the 
hospital. A therapist herself -- until last month, she was director of 
occupational therapy at St. Jude -- Moell finds ways to individualize the radio 
sessions to complement each patient's therapy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping Grace with her speech, for example, Moell works with 
another stroke patient who needs to relearn the left-to-right visual pattern 
necessary for reading. For that, she gives him a turn at reading the weather 
report on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all they can manage is a barely audible "Hi," in the case of one 
brain-injury patient, Moell tries to include everyone. And the folks out there 
in radio land try to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely like to put all your names in my log," Pat says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the program's radio contacts send in QSL cards -- post cards used in 
ham radio to acknowledge a contact -- and some go so far as to send individual 
cards for everyone who was at the session, Moell says. "That really means a lot 
to them." And the rehab patients reciprocate as they can. "If they can't write, 
then we let them stamp the cards," Moell says. One radio contact who lived 
nearby dropped by to deliver QSL cards in person, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most hams have been really wonderful. They seem to sense what's going on," she 
says. She also explains the situation over the radio, answering questions about 
the program from curious radio operators. 
</P>
<P>
During this session, hams across the nation and in Canada acknowledged the 
group's "CQs" and waited patiently for a turn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first experience talking to people in therapy," says Pat, who 
listened as the patients talked, at Moell's prompting, about what they like to 
do when they're not in the hospital, and what kind of therapy they're working 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking and my leg," Grace says. Her husband, John, sits next to her and 
offered encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
After everyone has had a chance to talk to Pat, she signs off and gives others 
a chance to talk to the Fullerton group. They meet Harry, a retired optometrist 
in Mississippi, and Randy, a minister in Indiana, as well as two men on 
opposite sides of the U.S.-Canadian border in New York and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we call good wheelchair copy," Moell says to one contact whose 
transmission is coming in strong. "We can hear you clearly all over the room." 
</P>
<P>
Hams use phonetics to make their call letters understandable, and Moell often 
deviates from the preferred words to make a humorous point. "This is Whiskey 
Delta Six Bed Pan Trainer," she says, reminding her audience that the 
transmission is coming from inside a hospital. "They always get that right 
away," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important for them to maintain contact with the outside world," 
says Richard Boyle, a recreational therapist who works with Moell on the 
program. "We've even had patients who've gone on and gotten their ham radio 
licenses after trying it here." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling of isolation isn't so bad for those who have frequent visitors, 
says Bob Grigsby, a spinal cord injury patient who enjoys participating in the 
radio sessions. "My family has been very supportive, but everybody doesn't have 
that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people who've gotten kind of teary-eyed," Moell says. "A lot of 
times the people out there will say, 'We'll say prayers for you at dinner 
tonight.' It means a lot to think that there's somebody they just met who cares 
about them who doesn't have to. The staff here cares, too, but it's their job. 
For the hams, it isn't. But in a way, they're therapists, too."

FAMILY LIFE: OLD MODELS OBSOLETE FOR STEP-FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the term family has almost replaced the flag and apple pie as a 
buzzwords in political circles for all that is holy and right in America, it's 
odd that the fastest-growing kind of family -- and arguably the most troubled 
-- is also the most ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Step-families this year for the first time ever will outnumber the 
old-fashioned nuclear family in this country, according to government estimates 
that are expected to be substantiated by the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
Yet societal expectations and stereotypes combine to sweep under the rug any 
problems inherent in those families, says Zena D. Polly, Ph.D., an Irvine 
clinical psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"The belief is that now that you have created a 'whole family' -- one with a 
father and mother and children -- all is right with the world and everyone will 
live happily ever after," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, she says, the individual members of the new family believe it, 
as do too many mental health professionals, so when that pretty picture fails 
to materialize, the situation becomes disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed, she says, is the "creation of a whole new model of family. We've 
got to stop using the same ideal for step-families that we do for nuclear 
families. Otherwise, we're doomed to be forever failing." 
</P>
<P>
Polly, who will discuss the whole process on May 8 at CPC Hospital's "Family 
Focus" free lecture series ((714) 831-1800 for information), says her goal is 
to make step-families more aware that "they are different and their situation 
is difficult, but by no means impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Step-families can work extremely well, she says, when the expectations are 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole process of step-families is turned completely upside-down," says 
Polly. "In the nuclear family, a couple have a courtship, get married, 
negotiate their roles, plan and then have children. 
</P>
<P>
"The step-family condenses the process. The children are there first, and their 
presence overshadows everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, she says, the very qualities in a child that sustained a 
single-parent family become the most disruptive when the parent remarries. 
</P>
<P>
"The child generally has become a companion and partner to a single parent," 
she says, "and is required to assume more mature responsibilities, to become 
deeply involved in the daily ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, Mom or Dad remarries and immediately the child is expected to become 
'just a kid' again, to back off. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it doesn't work that way. The child resents being pushed aside and 
generally blames the new stepparent." 
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest paradoxes, according to Polly, is that the harder a new 
stepparent tries, the worse the situation can become. 
</P>
<P>
"The child is thrown into a loyalty conflict," she says, "especially if he or 
she genuinely likes the new parent. 
</P>
<P>
"The child often feels he has to choose between the natural father or mother 
and the stepfather or mother. 
</P>
<P>
"The child then pulls away, the stepparent feels rejected and runs the other 
way. Then, you face the distinct possibility of that parent becoming the 'evil 
stepparent' of myth and movies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to recognize that not all important members of a family live in the 
same house." 
</P>
<P>
Another change demanded of children, especially teen-agers, in a step-family, 
says Polly, is that they put their own growth on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"Here they are at the age when nature meant for them to start flapping their 
wings and getting ready to leave the nest. They want to -- and should -- be 
spending more time with their peers, groping for their own identities, finding 
their own way. 
</P>
<P>
"But stepparents, aided and abetted by the natural parent they married, want 
closeness, demand immediate bonding or they feel rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"So, once again, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The child resents going 
on a family picnic when he could be at the beach with his friends. He blames 
the stepparent, who is blaming him, and it just escalates from there." 
</P>
<P>
The simple fact is, she says, "everyone gets caught in the middle and no one 
knows what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
"The parent, haunted by the last divorce, fears another, so the tendency is to 
put on an act that 'everything's going to be OK.' 
</P>
<P>
"And too often, when they try to get professional help, they go to someone who 
buys into the same myths about step-families that the couple have. So, they 
wind up looking everywhere for the root cause of the problem and ignore the 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
The "obvious" is the fact that they got married. 
</P>
<P>
The answer? 
</P>
<P>
"Recognize that it takes time to cement this new family," she says. "Most 
people will tell you it takes a year, but in truth it takes anywhere from three 
to five years before the members of a step-family feel solid and relaxed 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Be willing to confront each and every problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Share your frustrations with others in the same boat; join a couples group." 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, she says, recognize that a step-family is not the family Norman 
Rockwell painted at Thanksgiving. It is different -- "not bad, not good, just 
different, and OK."

ANN CONWAY: NEWPORT HARBOR MUSEUM COUNCIL DEFENDS ITS ART;

MODERN WORKS ARE 'WHAT'S HAPPENING'

They call themselves the Museum Council of the Newport Harbor Art Museum. But 
Ginny Shaw has another name for the women who raise big bucks for the museum of 
contemporary art: the defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I frequently find myself defending the museum," said the Museum Council member 
on Tuesday, balancing a cup of tea in the facility's leafy Sculpture Garden. 
"I'll be with a group of people who start asking me questions like: 'Why 
doesn't the museum have the Old Masters, the Impressionists?' 
</P>
<P>
"I try to explain to them that we chose to be a contemporary museum, that not 
many museums can afford to purchase Van Goghs. And I tell them what we have is 
what's happening in the world today."

<P>
Old and new members of the Museum Council had come together to sip tea, polish 
off dainty sandwiches and talk shop. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum has a wonderful national and international reputation," said June 
Donovan, a council member for seven years. "But I don't think we're appreciated 
enough in the county. That's where we come in. Council members not only make 
money for the museum, they act as a liaison. We're good-will ambassadors. 
Personally, I like modern art because it's a challenge. It keeps me open to new 
things." 
</P>
<P>
New member Charlotte Wood said she joined the council for the chance to learn 
about contemporary art. "We can't afford the Impressionists, the Old Masters," 
she said, "so we'd better enjoy this. It's the art of our time!" 
</P>
<P>
After the group had a chance to chat, council President Peggy Spiess told new 
members about the council's accomplishments. "We've had glamorous garage sales, 
antique shows, Christmas tree galas, and now we have our Consignment Shop in 
Costa Mesa," she said proudly. "Last month alone, it made $17,000 for museum 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Spiess explained that the shop, on 17th Street in Costa Mesa, had 
raised $100,000 for the museum from the time it opened in March, 1989, until 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
It's secret? Quality merchandise. "We began with a marvelous collection of 
Steuben crystal -- 148 pieces -- donated to us by Pacific Mutual," Spiess said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us a year to sell it. One of the reasons we made so much money last 
month was that we sold 50 pieces of the Steuben. The crystal gave us a 
wonderful start." 
</P>
<P>
The Consignment Shop is currently the council's largest fund-raising effort. 
But the group has its eye on other projects, Spiess said. "Two years ago, we 
had an event called a Suite Affair," she said. "Six premiere hotels opened up 
their rooms, their kitchens, their suites, and let hundreds take a peek. They 
enjoyed wonderful champagne and food. We plan to do that again next year. We're 
waiting because you have to give the community and the hotels a chance to 
breathe!" 
</P>
<P>
To become a member of the council, a woman has to be sponsored by two members, 
Spiess explained, adding that membership dues were an ultra-reasonable $35 per 
year. "We try to keep membership at no more than 125 to 150 members. That's all 
we can really handle for our projects." 
</P>
<P>
Spiess said the group tries to steer away from the clique image. "But with a 
museum, you always have the elitist factor," she said. "Our group attracts the 
well-educated, interested-in-the-arts type of person, the achievers. My only 
problem as a president is, I have too many chiefs!" 
</P>
<P>
The chiefs must be doing something right. They raise so much money that "every 
month the museum board gives us a round of applause," Spiess said.

ASK THE VET: CAT'S EAR PAIN MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: During the past year and a half, our 13-year-old cat has had increasing 
irritation and pain around her ear area. She used to love having the area 
around her ears rubbed and scratched but now she is "fightin' mad" when anyone 
gets near the area. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, we had her checked for ear mites; none were found. Nevertheless, we 
followed with consecutive courses of two types of eardrops, one for ear mites, 
the next an antibiotic drop. Both of the drops obviously caused her even more 
irritation and pain in her ears. She also was given systemic antibiotics for a 
week at a time during and after the drops. The systemic drugs seemed to 
slightly improve the irritation. 
</P>
<P>
This year I wanted to solve the problem and so had her anesthetized, ears 
cleaned out, culture and sensitivity run, and X-rays taken to rule out 
middle-ear involvement, polyps, or tumors. The culture grew nothing pathogenic, 
the X-rays showed nothing wrong at all. Do you have any suggestions or 
diagnosis possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
Karen Shea, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
A: Since a fair amount of work-up has been done on your cat's ear canals with 
no apparent abnormalities, you might want to consider problems in nearby areas. 
You want to make sure that she is not having any dental problems or disorders 
of her gums or back of the throat. Although it is uncommon, have your vet check 
the cervical spine on the X-rays to make sure there is no disc or end plate 
disease. A skin scraping will rule out mites in the skin around the head and 
neck. If the skin appears inflamed or abnormal, a biopsy should be done. 
</P>
<P>
Some cats have a condition called hyperesthesia which basically means their 
skin is very sensitive to the touch. This generally occurs over the tail base 
and lower back. The cause is often unknown and can be very difficult to treat. 
Neuritis or inflamed nerve endings can occur but should respond to 
anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteriods. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else is found abnormal on your cat, your veterinarian may want to 
refer her to a veterinary neurologist for some special studies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it OK to use the same flea-killing products on my cat that we use for our 
dogs? We have two types of shampoos, a dip and some flea sprays. 
</P>
<P>
Steve May, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
A: Always make sure that you read the labels on these products carefully before 
using any of them on your pets. Many dips cannot be used on cats: Avoid 
alcohol-based flea sprays on your cat. Shampoos with pyrethrins should be safe 
on cats.

Lothar Spaeth, the governor of Baden-Wuerttemberg state, called for cuts in 
NATO training flights after two Canadian jets collided on a training flight, 
killing one pilot and showering the city of Karlsruhe with flaming debris. "In 
times of East-West detente, our people can no longer be told that military air 
maneuvers must continue at their present extent," Spaeth said. Canada revealed 
that the F-18 jets were involved in an interceptor flight, a simulated chase, 
and said that such flights will be suspended pending an investigation.

The 21% to 43% salary raises for top California State University officials 
should be rolled back to only 3.7% and an audit should be done of the 
university's administrative costs, an Assembly subcommittee urged in 
Sacramento. The unanimous action by the Ways and Means Subcommittee on 
Education clearly was intended as a message to the Cal State Board of Trustees, 
which will be meeting to deal with the controversial pay hikes and allegations 
of secrecy surrounding them. Subcommittee chairman Robert J. Campbell 
(D-Richmond) said his budget amendments were intended to make the 20-campus Cal 
State system "more responsible, more responsive and more open."

A measure to prohibit abortions in California after 24 weeks of pregnancy was 
soundly defeated in the state Senate's health committee. 
</P>
<P>
The measure by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) would have allowed abortion 
after the sixth month of pregnancy only if the mother's life were in danger, 
the fetus were seriously deformed or if doctors determined it couldn't live on 
its own. Committee members didn't even bother to hear testimony from about 20 
people who wanted to testify against the measure, acknowledging that they 
already intended to vote against it. Not a single member voted for the measure, 
and five voted against it.

<P>
Subcommittee chairman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond) said his budget 
amendments were intended to make the 20-campus Cal State system "more 
responsible, more responsive and more open." Also approved was a requirement 
that any future decisions about top salaries for Cal State administrators be 
made at public meetings. The university trustees last fall authorized their 
chairwoman, Marianthi Lansdale, and system Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds to make 
salaries for 27 administrators more competitive nationally. But the trustees 
didn't vote on the specifics, and subsequent publicity about the raises at a 
time of austerity caused such an uproar that Reynolds' hold on her job is said 
to be at stake this week. On Jan. 1, Reynolds' pay jumped 43%, to $195,000 a 
year, and salaries for the campus presidents, vice chancellors and the 
executive vice chancellor increased 21% to 28%, to a range of from $130,000 to 
$150,000.

SCHOOL-HOPPING TAKES YOSHIDA FOR AN EMOTIONAL RIDE

<P>
Wendell Yoshida, the girls' basketball coach at Palos Verdes High School, has 
gone from euphoria to despair since the season ended last month. 
</P>
<P>
First, the euphoria: 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore prospect Jeffra Gausepohl, a 6-foot-5 center from Kennett High School 
in Kennett Square, Pa., will transfer to Palos Verdes at the end of the school 
year, Yoshida said. 
</P>
<P>
The teaming of Gausepohl with 6-3 sophomore center Monique Morehouse, an 
All-Southern Section choice for Palos Verdes, would have given the Sea Kings 
one of the most dominant front courts in the South Bay. Or anywhere, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the despair comes in. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida said Morehouse has transferred to another high school to be with her 
mother, who recently moved out of the area. Yoshida hopes Morehouse will return 
(her stepfather still lives in the Palos Verdes area), but isn't holding his 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where (Morehouse) is," Yoshida said. "The school can't give out 
that information, and she hasn't communicated with me." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida said Morehouse left Palos Verdes about three weeks ago, not long after 
she helped the Sea Kings reach the Division III regional finals. The promising 
post player averaged 12 points and 12 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," Yoshida said. "She's been (in the Palos Verdes area) 
since junior high. I've worked with her both years in high school." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Yoshida can understand what Ed Hoffman is going through. 
Hoffman coached Gausepohl at Kennett, a small school of less than 600 students 
outside Philadelphia. How hard did he take the news of Gausepohl's transfer? 
</P>
<P>
"The coach went into mourning when he heard that," said Kennett Athletic 
Director Vic Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
That's understandable. At 6-5, the 14-year-old Gausepohl is taller than former 
Palos Verdes stars Heidi and Heather Burge were at the same age. The 6-5 twins 
helped the University of Virginia reach the NCAA Final Four this season as 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Gausepohl averaged 14.2 points and 10 rebounds this season, pacing Kennett to 
the South Chester County League title and the district semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida has never seen her play, but he is aware of her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"For someone that size and that young, she is pretty coordinated," Schuster 
said. "She is highly motivated and her parents are highly motivated for her to 
do well in basketball. She is definitely a hard-core player; she plays when 
she's not feeling well. She is pretty tough for a 14-year-old kid. 
</P>
<P>
"She dominated in our league. She controlled the boards, and much of the 
offense was designed for getting her the ball. When she went out of the game 
with fouls, it was a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Gausepohl told her school paper that she is looking forward to playing for 
Palos Verdes next season. She visited the school in January, and her father, 
Jeff, has been working in the South Bay, Yoshida said. 
</P>
<P>
"They come from a rural area of Pennsylvania," said the Palos Verdes coach. 
"They like the trees and that type of surrounding. Really the only area like 
that in the South Bay is Palos Verdes." 
</P>
<P>
The other attraction is a fine basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, Yoshida has built Palos Verdes into one of the most successful 
girls programs in Southern California. The Sea Kings have reached the Southern 
Section divisional finals two of the last three years and have won 47 straight 
Bay League games, including four consecutive titles. They were 29-6 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gausepohl said one of the biggest adjustments she'll have to make at Palos 
Verdes is playing with a 30-second clock, which is not used in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched some of their games," she said. "I think I can compete, but it 
will be a lot faster. I have to work on my endurance." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida will coach a team of South Bay seniors Friday in the 10th annual 
Optimists All-Star Basketball Classic at El Camino College. The girls' game is 
scheduled for 6 p.m., followed by the boys' game at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Area girls expected to play for the South Bay against a team of Westside 
all-stars are Lisa Humphries, Susan Wilhite and Mary Maloney of Palos Verdes; 
Suzy McIver and Jennifer Spieske of Redondo; Marquel Weaver and Detra Young of 
Banning; Rosa Olloque of West Torrance; Shasta Paris, Tiffany Matsumora and 
Jennifer Ogata of Narbonne; Carolyn Hiramoto of North Torrance; Jstone Vines of 
San Pedro, and Kawacsi Jackson and Tanika Smith of Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
College signings: Rolling Hills goalkeeper Natalie McDowell has signed a letter 
of intent to play soccer for Washington State. Coach John Vredenburgh said 
McDowell is the first girl at Rolling Hills to earn a full scholarship in 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes' Humphries, the team's leading scorer, has signed a letter of 
intent to play basketball for Loyola Marymount. The 5-11 senior, who averaged 
15 points a game, will receive a partial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
A chance meeting with John Stevenson two Sundays ago found the El Segundo 
baseball coach drafting a fantasy baseball team at the Stick 'N' Stein in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how his team was shaping up, Stevenson replied: "I don't know, but I just 
got Barry Larkin in the fifth round." 
</P>
<P>
Great pick. As of Wednesday, the Cincinnati Reds' shortstop was leading the 
major leagues with a .594 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance's baseball team entered this week tied for second place in the 
Ocean League with a 4-2 record despite hitting only .235 as a team. 
</P>
<P>
In 366 at-bats, the Warriors have 16 extra-base hits, with just four home runs. 
Second baseman Dane Cowing (.302) is the only West player hitting above .300. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a hitting phenom," first-year Coach Dick McGrath quipped. "It's 
definitely a challenge for the coach." 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Volleyball Club is holding tryouts for boys in grades 9-12 for the 
upcoming United States Volleyball Assn. season. Two sessions will be held 
Sunday and April 29 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The tryout fee is $5 per player. For more information, contact Tim Ittner at 
429-0905 or Lawrence Hom at 770-6607.

CANYONS PULLS INTO TIE FOR WSC LEAD; 
</P>
<P>
JC BASEBALL: GIBSON STYMIES GLENDALE WITH A 5-HITTER TO END MONTHLONG 
CONFERENCE DROUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lance Gibson is a starting pitcher for College of the Canyons, but his 
complete-game victory at Glendale on Wednesday came as quite a relief -- for 
his relievers and his coach. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning a stretch of three Western State Conference games in four days, 
including a date with conference co-leader Cuesta on Saturday, Canyons Coach 
Len Mohney wasn't eager to overextend his pitching staff against Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson responded with a complete-game five-hitter, allowing only one earned run 
in Canyons' 14-2 victory. Gibson (4-3) had not won a WSC game since March 22, 
but his effort Wednesday helped boost Canyons (21-10, 12-3 in conference play) 
into a first-place tie with Cuesta, a game ahead of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"To get a complete game out of Gibson makes us real healthy for (today) and 
Saturday," Mohney said. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons led, 6-0, when Gibson allowed an unearned run in the eighth. Glendale 
scored its other run in the ninth on John Bojanac's eighth home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to go the distance," said Gibson, who struck out five and walked 
only one. "It's probably one of my best games of the season, and it's good to 
get it late in the season." 
</P>
<P>
The game began as a pitchers' duel; Gibson combining an effective split-finger 
fastball with off-speed pitches, and Glendale left-hander Matt Whisenant 
countering with his mitt-popping fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons led, 1-0, after five innings before touching Whisenant (4-4) for two 
runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Vlcek replaced Whisenant in the eighth, but the only relief he provided 
was to the Canyons batters, who had struck out 10 times against Whisenant but 
battered Vlcek with 11 runs in 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The defense for Glendale (12-22, 6-10) contributed to the blowout by committing 
four errors during Vlcek's stint. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons scored three runs in the eighth and eight more in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Steve Kovacic, recently moved to the cleanup spot, hit a 
three-run home run to left in the ninth, and first baseman Mike Kerber followed 
three batters later with another three-run home run to left. Kerber had 
Canyons' only other extra-base hit, a double. 
</P>
<P>
Every starter had at least one hit and one strikeout in Canyons' 18-hit 
onslaught. Gary Morgan, the only regular who didn't score, led the team with 
four hits. Ron Robart, Kovacic, Charlie Fowlks and Billy Horvat all had two 
hits apiece for Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons also stole nine bases.

DOMINGUEZ AND EARNEST UNDO REDONDO WITH BIG HITS IN MIRA COSTA VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
His fastball was good enough to strike out 12 batters Wednesday night, but 
Redondo High right-hander Frank Bignami wouldn't mind having a couple of them 
back. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bignami's fastballs ended up behind Redondo's right field fence. Another 
one landed in back of the left field wall. 
</P>
<P>
And those two pitches were the difference in Mira Costa's 6-3 Ocean League 
victory over Bignami and host Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two big swings were the ballgame," Mira Costa Coach Jim Beaumont said. 
The victory moved the Mustangs (7-10 overall, 5-2 in league) into second place 
in the Ocean League behind Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The first big blow came with one out in the second inning, when left fielder 
Scott Earnest -- who entered the game hitting below .200 -- turned on a Bignami 
fastball and drove it over the right-field wall for a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
In the next inning, Bignami (3-3) left a fastball over the plate for Mira Costa 
third baseman Bobby Dominguez, who pulled it over the left field fence for two 
more runs and a 5-0 Mira Costa lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, one of the Mustangs' top players, was making his first appearance 
since breaking his wrist five weeks ago in a brawl with Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"That home run by Bobby gave us a big lift," Beaumont said. "A homer for him in 
his first game back is just icing on the cake for him." 
</P>
<P>
Third-place Redondo (9-9, 4-3) scrapped out three runs on six hits against 
Jason Garner, but couldn't break through for more than one run in any inning. 
The Sea Hawks stranded 10 runners. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed Garner (2-5) threw 141 pitches in posting a complete game. He 
walked seven and hit one, but four of his nine strikeouts came with the bases 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
"Jason has been pretty resilient," Beaumont said. "He never complains about a 
sore arm. He's our best guy, so he wasn't coming out of the game. He's never 
been that wild before, but he was getting his fastball by people so we stayed 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Redondo pulled within 5-2 in the fifth when Bob Tassin drew a bases-loaded 
walk. But the Mustangs got an insurance run when designated-hitter Cody Beason 
scored on Chris Townsend's error. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawks cut the lead to three again in the bottom of the seventh when 
Bignami delivered a one-out single to score Brett Tyrrell. But Garner struck 
out Tassin and Scott Denhart with runners on first and second to end the game.

ANDERSON STAYS SUMMERTIME HOT AS PALOS VERDES ROMPS TO 9-3 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blake Anderson, Palos Verdes High School's man for all seasons, was at it again 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, quarterback for the Bay League co-champion football team and a 
defender on the Southern Section 4-A champion soccer team, made the big plays 
to help the Sea Kings defeat Leuzinger, 9-3, in a Bay League baseball game at 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hit a solo home run to center field in the third inning to tie the 
score, 3-3, and stole home in the fifth when Palos Verdes scored twice to take 
a 5-3 lead. He finished with two hits and two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
The senior catcher collected two hits Monday in a 16-11 non-league victory over 
Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"He is swinging the bat really well," said Coach Gil Eberhard, whose team 
improved to 11-6 overall and 5-2 in league play, good for a second-place tie 
with Rolling Hills and Torrance. Beverly Hills is in first place at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Steve Hoye went the distance to even his league record at 2-2. He 
allowed seven hits and one earned run, and helped himself offensively with two 
hits and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Pat O'Hara also had two hits, and Jason Goldberg keyed a four-run sixth for the 
Sea Kings with a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger fell to 2-5 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills 10, Hawthorne 2 -- Ryan Buxton's pinch-hit, bases-loaded double 
highlighted a six-run fourth inning, and right-hander Kirt Kishita hurled his 
fifth consecutive complete-game victory to lead the Titans at Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Buxton, a sophomore, drove in three runs with his double, as Rolling Hills 
battled back from a 2-1 deficit. Stefan Wahlstron and Ben Schneider each added 
two RBIs for the Titans, who evened their overall mark at 8-8 and maintained a 
second-place mark of 5-2 in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Wahlstron was four-for-four, including two doubles, while Schneider batted 
two-for-two. 
</P>
<P>
Kishita (5-3), a junior who has gone the distance in all eight of his 
decisions, allowed eight hits, struck out eight and walked five. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne slipped to 8-13 overall and 0-7 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City 4, West Torrance 2 -- Left-hander Mauricio Estavil, who pitched a 
no-hitter against West last season, struck out 17 to pace the first-place 
Centaurs to an Ocean League victory at Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"He had us totally off-balance," said West Coach Dick McGrath, whose team fell 
to 6-9 overall and 4-3 in league play. "My guys were missing the ball by six 
inches. It wasn't even close. He was very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil, who gave up five hits, won his fourth league game without a loss, as 
Culver City improved to 6-1 in the Ocean League standings. 
</P>
<P>
Estavil walked home both of West's runs. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance 5, South Torrance 4 -- The Saxons jumped to a 5-0 lead and held 
off the Spartans for an Ocean League win at South. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for South (6-9 overall and 3-4 in 
league play). North, which allowed four hits, improved to 8-9 and 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Banning 14, Crenshaw 1 -- Julian Pardo and Sal Areyan each had three RBIs, and 
right-hander Mike Busby allowed five hits and struck out 10 to pace the Pilots 
to an easy Southern-Pacific Conference victory at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Pardo was two for three with a home run and a double, while Areyan went three 
for four with a triple and double as Banning improved to 11-7 overall and 7-3 
in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Busby (6-3), the South Bay leader with 91 strikeouts in 62 innings, turned a 
triple play in the third inning. With the bases loaded, the junior struck out 
the batter. The ball got past the catcher, but bounced off the backstop toward 
Busby, who tagged out the runner breaking for home. Busby then threw out the 
runner at first, who had run halfway to second before discovering the runner at 
second was still on the base. 
</P>
<P>
Carson 6, Dorsey 1 -- Junior left-hander Marco Martinez pitched a three-hitter 
at Rancho Cienega Playground to help the Colts extend their unbeaten streak to 
nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore David Mauney belted a two-run homer in the third to highlight an 
eight-hit attack for Carson, which improved to 10-3-2 overall and 7-1-2 in the 
Southern-Pacific Conference, good for a 1 1/2-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 5, San Pedro 3 -- The upset at Washington knocked the Pirates out of 
second place in the Southern-Pacific Conference. San Pedro is 9-7-2 overall and 
5-4-1 in conference play, 2 1/2 games behind first-place Carson.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM TRIES NOVEL APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who says that baseball and literature don't mix? 
</P>
<P>
They do at Birmingham High, where Coach Wayne Sink read to his team Monday at 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Reading? At baseball practice? You'd think the only printed word on the diamond 
would be the lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not as strange as it might sound. Sink wasn't reading Shakespearean 
sonnets. He was reading from David Halberstam's latest book, "The Summer of 
'49," a chronicle of the pennant race between the Boston Red Sox and the New 
York Yankees in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest, said Sink, was a passage in which veterans of the 
proud, tradition-laden Yankees browbeat 22-year-old Yogi Berra for loafing 
after he hit a popup. Sink also wanted his players to hear a passage in which 
an injured Joe DiMaggio, after playing both ends of a doubleheader, asked aloud 
how Berra, a fresh-legged rookie, could beg out of catching the second game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something to be learned," Sink said. "There was an ethic there. There 
was a real dedication to work." 
</P>
<P>
With six Valley Pac-8 Conference games left and Birmingham leading the 
Mid-Valley League, Sink is hoping that the spring of '90 will prove worth 
chronicling in the annals of school history. 
</P>
<P>
Timely addition: Heath McElwee, who transferred to Granada Hills from L. A. 
Baptist a month ago, has been inserted into the Highlanders' pitching rotation 
after a strong showing in the Holt-Goodman tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
In two appearances, McElwee, a sophomore, allowed one earned run in seven 
innings and was three for seven at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Utility man: Need an explanation for Poly's 14-3 record? 
</P>
<P>
Consider the play of Rodrigo Dorame, a runaway winner for the team's Mr. 
Versatile Award if they choose to give one. 
</P>
<P>
Dorame is leading the team with 20 runs batted in and was batting .412 with 21 
hits in 51 at-bats before Wednesday's win over Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
While those contributions might seem more than enough to please Coach Jerry 
Cord, Dorame, a right fielder and designated-hitter, also is the No. 2 starting 
pitcher in a two-man rotation. Dorame, a junior, is 3-0 with a 2.30 earned-run 
average in 24 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Royal watch: Edward Smith, a transfer from El Paso, Tex., made his pitching 
debut for Royal last week in the Chino tournament. Smith, a 6-foot, 185-pound 
senior right-hander, hadn't pitched in almost two months but allowed just five 
hits in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, he blew the ball by people," Coach Dan Maye said. "But you could 
tell he was a little rusty. His pitches were barely missing." 
</P>
<P>
Smith started Wednesday against Simi Valley, working six innings in a 6-4 loss. 
He gave up seven hits and five walks but struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Ineligible: North Hollywood, making a run for second place in the East Valley 
League, will do so without the services of starting center fielder Duane 
Braxton and first baseman Craig White, both of whom are academically 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Braxton was hitting .428 with a home run and five RBIs.

THE COLLEGES;

<P>
STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE HELPS CS NORTHRIDGE BOLSTER RANKING IN BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge trails UC Riverside by 2 1/2 games in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball standings, but the Matadors are several 
notches above the Highlanders in the NCAA Division II baseball rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (25-15) is ranked seventh. Riverside (31-10) is No. 12, although the 
Highlanders are 2-0 against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Although Northridge's record isn't quite as good as Riverside's, the Matadors 
have maintained their season-long advantage in the ratings due to the strength 
of their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The rankings are tabulated using a "power rating" points formula. The breakdown 
goes as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Five points for a victory over a Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
Four points for a victory over a Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
Three points for a loss to a Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
Two points for a victory over an NAIA team, or a loss to a Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's advantage over Riverside stems from the Matadors' having played 
five more Division I games than the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside is 6-4 against major college competition, while CSUN is 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do rankings as opposed to the ratings, there's no way you'd have us 
ahead of them," said Bill Kernen, Northridge's coach. "I'm just hoping that's 
an indication of where we're going to be. This is one time that you hope the 
polls are right." 
</P>
<P>
Back to the future: Which is the CCAA's best baseball team? 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, Kernen says. But perhaps not for long. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it from the standpoint of experience and talent, they're 
probably the best team in the league," Kernen said. "If you're talking about 
talent for the future then maybe we are. . . But that doesn't mean we can't 
catch them. Most teams, no matter how good they are, usually have a rough spot 
some time in the season. They just haven't had a bad one yet." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge plays the Highlanders in a three-game series next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing our best at a time when you want to be," said Kernen, whose team 
has won 13 of its past 16 games. "I don't necessarily think we have to sweep to 
win it, but it's hard for me to say. Right now I'm more worried about Chapman." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Chapman play a three-game set starting today. The Panthers are 
tied with the Matadors for second place in the CCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking positive: His team had just stranded 13 runners and his pitching staff 
had just given up five home runs and walked 13 batters, but Kernen was far from 
downcast after the Matadors' 14-13, 10-inning loss to UC Santa Barbara on 
Tuesday. CSUN had 20 hits, including five home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best offensive performance we've had here in two years," Kernen 
said. "Offensively, we just buried them, but you're going to pay for it when 
you walk 13 batters. . . . You don't want to focus on the negative in a game 
like this. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's a tough loss, but I couldn't be happier with the way we hit." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's homers included solo shots by Greg Shockey, Mike Sims and Craig 
Clayton in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Matador single-game home run record is seven, set against United States 
International University (1984) and The Master's College (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Home run derby: Glendale's Art Chute has set a new school season record with 10 
home runs and is one short of the Glendale career record of 17. 
</P>
<P>
He is the second Valley-area player to break his junior college's home run 
record this spring. Mike Suarez broke the Moorpark season mark with seven home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the most prolific power hitter in the Valley area, J. R. Trujillo of 
Canyons, remains considerably short his school's home run record. Trujillo has 
hit 11 and is six shy of Pete Kuld's record total of 17, set in 1986.

Tajah Merrill, who withdrew from Camarillo High on Monday, pitched for Channel 
Islands on Wednesday in the Raiders' 17-12 loss to Thousand Oaks in a Marmonte 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, a junior left-hander who was 2-1 with a 0.91 earned-run average at 
Camarillo, left the school for personal reasons. He enrolled at Channel Islands 
on Tuesday, and gave up five runs on four hits in one inning Wednesday.

San Diego State men's basketball has received an oral commitment from Keith 
Balzer, a 6-foot-8 forward from Imperial Valley Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Balzer averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds a game for Imperial last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a 6-8 perimeter player, he can shoot the three, he can take it to the 
hole . . . he's probably the finest offensive rebounder I've ever had," said 
Jeff Deyo, Imperial Valley coach.

Balzer also took official visits to Washington, Pepperdine, Colorado State and

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS WON'T LET ZUNGUL PRACTICE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler said Wednesday he has been advised by Dr. David Flood, 
the team physician, not to let veteran forward Steve Zungul practice or play in 
any of the season's remaining games because of his arthritic hips. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul, 35, was told Wednesday that he could not practice. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he will schedule a meeting with Zungul this week to discuss the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor felt when the season started that Steve shouldn't play," Fowler 
said. "Steve maintained that his condition hadn't deteriorated in the last 
several years and convinced us that he could play through it." 
</P>
<P>
Zungul has said he will not retire before the end of the season, and Fowler 
said he won't interfere with those plans. DON PATTERSON

For people who adore Norman Rockwell art, Reader's Digest and mayonnaise, John 
Naisbitt's best-selling "Megatrends 2000" offers tantalizing insights into the 
future. People who prefer to shock their neurons with obscure ethnic cuisines 
and Mapplethorpe photography are better off reading cyberpunk -- a genre that 
completely redefines the ecology of technology and the technology of ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Cyberpunk is science fiction with an attitude; glossily dystopian visions of 
pop cultures dissolving in the sleaze of their own technologies. Characters 
"jack on" to global networks of computer-generated artificial realities; 
technology isn't a creation of a scientifically trained elite but of 
disillusioned masses and greedy entrepreneurs groping for new media to get 
high. "The street finds its own uses for things" is a cyberpunk motto. Crack is 
a cyberpunk-like phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain central themes spring up repeatedly in cyberpunk," notes Bruce 
Sterling, the Texas-based cyberpunk polemicist who edited the popular 
"Mirrorshades" anthology. "The theme of body invasion: prosthetic limbs, 
implanted circuitry, cosmetic surgery, genetic alteration. The even more 
powerful theme of mind invasion: brain-computer interfaces, artificial 
intelligence, neurochemistry -- techniques radically redefining the nature of 
humanity, the nature of self." 
</P>
<P>
These themes are crammed into densely intricate prose that creates, in 
Sterling's metaphor, "the literary equivalent of the hard-rock 'wall of sound' 
" designed to pummel the reader with imagery that alternately stimulates the 
imagination and depresses the spirit. Picture a Tom Clancy embittered by the 
technology about which he now rhapsodizes and amplify the intensity of that 
prose a few thousand volts and you have a glimmer of what the cyberpunk genre 
is like. 
</P>
<P>
But scrape through the layers of metaphor and post-Modern posturing by the 
cyberpunks (they're called "Techno-Goths" in England) and you find some 
jaggedly profound insights -- the sort of insights that Naisbittesque futurists 
don't see and can't grasp. 
</P>
<P>
In cyberpunk, human beings are analog machines of flesh and neurochemicals that 
can be engineered, edited and transformed into fleshy nodes on cyberspace 
networks. People meld into the machinery. By contrast, the machinery -- the 
networks, computers and gloomily engineered urban landscapes -- are eerily 
organic. They are almost living things. They're the "natural" environment. They 
recall the line from Buckminster Fuller -- who was anything but a cynical 
cyberpunk -- that "natural is whatever nature allows." 
</P>
<P>
Cyberpunk takes Fuller's definition of nature right to the edge and beyond. In 
cyberpunk worlds, the lines between "natural" and "artificial" become arbitrary 
to the point of meaningless. Technology isn't something distinct from the 
environment or a part of the environment -- the technology is the environment; 
it's every bit as "natural" as a blade of grass or a drop of (acid) rain. 
</P>
<P>
Is a human being less "natural" because he or she wears eyeglasses or needs to 
be hooked up to a dialysis machine? Are farms more "natural" than cities -- or 
is the technique of agriculture itself an unnatural act? Psychotropic drugs and 
infectious diseases are "natural," aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
If a city depends on freeways and automobiles to provide for its citizens, are 
automobiles a natural or unnatural technology? When we talk about "The 
Environment" and "The Ecology," do we mean a pre-Industrial Age kind of 
ecology, or do we mean an environment robust enough to cope with both the 
benefits and excesses of technology? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most contemporary fiction, the cyberpunk genre cynically reminds us that 
our notions of environment and ecology are purely arbitrary and fantastical; 
the word "natural" has been leeched of any real meaning. We live in a world 
where we seem to define "natural" as the absence of technology. But, as William 
Gibson, widely considered the father of the cyberpunk movement, says, "Where 
can you go today in the world where the environment isn't affected by human 
technology? . . . The bill is coming due on that first hundred years of 
industrialization." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, of course, is that building things is what we do. Man is often 
described as homo faber -- man the toolmaker. It's as natural for us to make 
tools as it is for birds to sing and plankton to recycle oxygen. We can't help 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that Nature pristine is what's ecologically "correct" and that man is 
the ruthless despoiler of once-vibrant ecosystems is sheer lunacy. Quite 
frankly, the societies on this earth that lack technology seem to endure life 
rather than enjoy it. These societies may be more ecologically "correct" than 
Los Angeles or Des Moines -- but so what? Our technologies are a part of the 
ecosystem. The question is, what kind of part do we want them to play? 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez "Shucks, folks, it was an accident. Sorry about that -- will 
you take a check?" attitude is disgusting. It displays contempt for the very 
idea of ecological balance. But does the Valdez disaster mean that society is 
inherently wrong to consume fossil fuels? Greenpeace and EarthFirst! might say 
yes. I would say no. The idea that we're evolving into a post-industrial 
agrarian economy where we stay home and chew our cuds and telecommute via our 
personal computers is bonkers. 
</P>
<P>
Events such as Earth Day and all the assorted hoopla beg some very fundamental 
questions: Is the "environmental movement" dedicated toward a more intelligent, 
more rational approach to management of waste products? Or is it a lifestyle 
movement that seeks to radically alter consumption? Or is it an anti-technology 
movement that wants to eliminate the pace of technical change? Or is it less a 
question of ecology than geopolitics -- a struggle between Northern wealth and 
Southern poverty? 
</P>
<P>
"Ecology is about to become a political commodity," says cyberpunker Sterling, 
who points out that much of the movement is "preservationist and 
conservationist; there's a siege mentality. The battle has to be taken to the 
enemy, which is the urban environments with their slabs of concrete and toxin 
production." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, break up the cities. No thank you. My view is as apolitical as 
possible: We should avoid making a mess and quickly clean up when we do. The 
irony here, as Gibson and Sterling point out, is that we need technology to 
measure, track and clean up the messes that other technologies make. 
</P>
<P>
No matter which way we turn -- be it greenhouse effect management, solar and 
geothermal energy generation or a new era of biodegradables/recyclables -- we 
are going to be in a shotgun marriage with technology. The cyberpunks paint 
worlds where that marriage is as hellishly oppressive as anything a post-Modern 
Dante could conjure up. But, in the real world, shotgun marriages don't have to 
be unhappy or end in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have to grit their teeth and learn to accept that human 
technology is as natural as snowfall in the mountains. Technologists have to 
understand that, unlike a generation ago, they can't escape the messes that 
they have helped create -- so they better prevent them or do a far better job 
of cleaning them up. Things will still get worse before they get better. But 
they will get better.

MEDFLY INFESTATION HAS FARMERS UNSURE HOW TO SAVE CROPS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: THREE THOUSAND ACRES OF COMMERCIAL CROPS ARE IN THE QUARANTINED 
AREA. THEY CANNOT BE SOLD UNTIL GROWERS TAKE COMPLICATED AND COSTLY 
PRECAUTIONS.

Tom Mazzetti would like to take to the air and spray his grapefruit and 
Valencia oranges with malathion as soon as possible. But he still hasn't heard 
from the government, the agencies that must sign off and supervise his 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
John Gless has a small stand of tangerines that he'd like to fumigate and 
eventually sell. But no one can tell him how to go about it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Week One of the first Mediterranean fruit fly infestation to hit a 
commercial agriculture area since the pest flew again into the Southern 
California consciousness nine months ago. It's a time of assessment and 
confusion, waiting and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
To date, it is unclear just how severe the economic consequences will be. But 
what is clear is who will pay: The 95 growers within the 81-square-mile 
quarantine area designated by the state and federal government last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County town of Woodcrest is at the center of the Medfly zone. 
Radiating out from the rural community are approximately 3,000 acres of 
commercial crops that cannot be sold until the farmers take complicated and 
costly precautions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those precautions -- such as fumigation and cold treatment to kill 
potential flies -- could damage the fruit enough to bring down prices or even 
render the crop worthless. Others, such as spraying with malathion bait, are 
costly in terms of time and money. 
</P>
<P>
At stake for Sunkist Growers Inc. -- the largest citrus marketer in the area -- 
is between $7 million and $8 million worth of Valencias and grapefruit. But if 
the crop is lost, Sunkist won't be hurting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the grower's individual loss," said Curt Anderson, vice president of 
public and member relations for Sunkist. "It's just like in a freeze or cold 
weather. We have no overall pooling to protect people. It's always been the 
individual grower's loss. It's always been the way they've played the game." 
</P>
<P>
In the past month, government officials have found two Medflies in the 
Woodcrest area. The first find, about four weeks ago, was in a Gless grove. The 
second, on April 13, was about two-thirds of a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
What this means for Gless, who has about 200 acres of citrus within the 
quarantine area, is deep trouble. About 100 acres of navel oranges were 
harvested before the quarantine hit. About 100 acres of Valencias and a few 
acres each of tangerines and grapefruit remain. 
</P>
<P>
If no more flies are found in the next three months -- enough time for three 
generations of Medflies to grow and the government's Cooperative Medfly Project 
to declare the area clean -- Gless and his neighbors will be home free. The 
quarantine will be lifted, and they can harvest and sell with no problems. 
</P>
<P>
But that's a big "if." At first, Gless was willing to cross his fingers and 
hope for the best. But as the gravity of the situation hit and the confusion 
mounted, his plans began to change. 
</P>
<P>
Gless on Monday: "If we can jump on it and eradicate it, our Valencias could 
last until August when it's eradicated. If there are no new finds, we might be 
able to harvest." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: "I think at this point, we'd like to ride it out and see if we can get 
past the quarantine time. . . . But I'm waiting to see what they tell us to do. 
I will do the baiting if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: "We'll do whatever we think is necessary. I plan on spraying mine. . 
. . We'll probably start Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Probably is the key word here, because the Medfly project still does not have 
instructions and permission forms together to allow the farmers to start 
salvaging their crops. While the agencies involved have been working on the 
urban infestations for nine months, the last time crops were hit was in 1981 
and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Gless hopes to get the project's package of information by Friday so that he, 
Mazzetti and as many other farmers they can get to join them can pool their 
resources, rent a helicopter and spray their fields with a combination of 
malathion, corn protein syrup bait and water. 
</P>
<P>
"We will give them the formula to mix the bait, if I ever get this packet 
together," Deborah McPartlan, a regulatory supervisor with the project, said 
Wednesday. "The (necessary permits) will be in the packet if we ever get it 
together. That's the only way they can apply something." 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, fruit within a half-mile radius of the fly finds cannot 
be sold unless it is cold treated or fumigated. All other fruit in the 
81-square-mile area must be sprayed with malathion bait every six to 10 days 
for 30 days before harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Cold treatment is a problem because very few packing houses have enough cold 
storage space to care for the fruit, which must be kept around 34 degrees 
Fahrenheit for 14 days, said Sunkist's Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough on grapefruit," Anderson said. "The rind gets brown spots on it 
from too cold temperatures. . . . You wouldn't be able to ship it very far. 
Cold that long doesn't do oranges any good either." 
</P>
<P>
Fumigation causes pitting in many citrus fruit, and, as Gless has found out, 
instructions are hard to come by. "No one right now knows how to tell me what 
to do to it," Gless said. "It's a small amount, but I would like to try to 
salvage that by fumigating or cold treating it." 
</P>
<P>
Spraying with malathion bait is not without its troubles either -- one of which 
could just be finding the chemicals to treat the groves. In the promised packet 
of information, the Medfly project will place a list of suppliers. But some of 
the listed companies don't carry the chemicals and have no plans to. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Country Farm Supply in Chino, which is on the project's supplier list: 
"Malathion bait? We're not going to sell that," said manager Mark Foley. "I 
don't know why they have us on the list. We only sell malathion in little 
retail packages. We don't really take on much ag business any more. I don't 
think we're going to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the more optimistic growers look past this first troubling week to a 
time when they will have a harvest. The question for them is how the market 
will react to their fruit. And the answer is just as confusing as Week One has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wood, an agricultural economist with the UC Cooperative Extension, said 
that predicting the marketplace is "a high-stakes dice game." 
</P>
<P>
"If there were 1,000 acres at 500 boxes per acre, you're talking about 500,000 
boxes of oranges, and that ought to make a dent in the supply and therefore the 
price should go up a bit," Wood said. "On the other hand, will people stop 
buying the oranges?" 
</P>
<P>
QUARANTINE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of two medflies in a Riverside citrus-growing area marks the 
first time a commercial area has been hit in the current infestation. The 
quarantine area covers 81 square miles and affects about 95 growers with 3,000 
acres of citrus. 
</P>
<P>
Black circles indicate most severely affected areas, roughly a half-mile radius 
around the two medfly finds. Those growers must fumigate their already 
harvested crop or subject it to cold treatment before it can be brought to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the groves in the quarantine area may have to be sprayed with 
malathion bait every six to 10 days before the fruit can be harvested.

COLDWELL UNIT GIVES GREY ITS AD BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The soft real estate market has caused a Southland scramble among real estate 
firms looking for new ad agencies. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, yet another change was made when Coldwell Banker Residential Real 
Estate handed its $15-million annual ad business to the Los Angeles office of 
Grey Advertising. BBDO/Los Angeles created ads for the Mission Viejo-based 
Coldwell Banker until January when it parted with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
But that was just the beginning of the ongoing real estate shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker's Commercial Group switched agencies earlier this month, 
handing its $5-million business to the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, 
McNamee WCRS after J. Walter Thompson/Los Angeles resigned it. In mid-March, 
Century 21 put its $30-million ad business up for review. Current agency 
McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles is still among the contenders for the business. 
</P>
<P>
As the real estate market continues to deteriorate nationally, ad executives 
speculate that other real estate firms may eventually shift accounts too. 
</P>
<P>
"When the business environment gets soft -- and I'm not just talking about real 
estate -- people tend to look for new agencies," said Jack Roth, president of 
the Los Angeles agency Admarketing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dog-eat-dog world out there when it comes to real estate," said Sherri 
Sprecher, national director of advertising for Coldwell Banker. "Grey gives us 
our first opportunity to establish a marketing partnership." Beyond that, said 
Lane Barnett, director of marketing at Coldwell Banker, the aim is to 
"transcend good solid (creativity) and focus on increasing our business." 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker ranks as one of the nation's largest real estate firms, with 
nearly 1,900 residential real estate offices in North America. The agency 
declined a request to release sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
For Grey Advertising's Los Angeles office, the win represents its first chance 
to create and place ads for a major real estate client. "This is not a 
shoot-from-the-hip reaction to a soft market," said Miles J. Turpin, chairman 
of the western division of Grey Advertising. "It was careful, strategic 
planning by the client." 
</P>
<P>
Turpin, whose Los Angeles office now posts annual billings of about $208 
million, said his office will probably hire about a dozen new employees to help 
with the business. 
</P>
<P>
"In a tough market, the guy with the best products and services will finish 
first," said Turpin. "Coldwell Banker is well-positioned to do just that."

HOW SUCCESSFUL S&amp;L OPERATION TURNED SOUR; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: GREAT AMERICAN BANK WAS AN INDUSTRY PIONEER. BUT THEN IT ACQUIRED A 
TUCSON OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Great American Bank seemed to have it all going its way. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Gordon Luce, a politically well connected and socially prominent 
Republican, had built the San Diego-based savings and loan into one of the 
industry's powerhouses. By the end of 1985, Luce had grown it to 117 branches 
and $8.2 billion in assets, up from three offices and $300 million in assets 
when he joined the thrift, then known as San Diego Federal, in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
By tracking the immense California population growth with new branches and by 
introducing a number of customer service and marketing innovations -- from 
automated teller machines to standardized branch design -- Luce helped pioneer 
the concept of a statewide S&amp;L, industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's solid growth -- combined with Luce's close relationship with 
Ronald Reagan -- made him one of the five or six most powerful men in the 
S&amp;L industry. An early political backer, fund-raiser and trusted adviser to 
the ex-actor, Luce was Governor Reagan's state Secretary for Business and 
Transportation. After Reagan became president, Luce became a special United 
Nations delegate. 
</P>
<P>
Luce's political pull was demonstrated by the fact that two of his 
ex-lieutenants at Great American, Edwin J. Gray and Lawrence W. Taggart, got 
appointed as top S&amp;L industry regulators -- Gray as Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board chairman and Taggart as state S&amp;L department chairman. Luce himself 
served a term as president of the California League of Savings Institutions, a 
statewide trade group. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, Luce and Great American took a wrong turn, perhaps a fatal one, by 
acquiring Home Federal Savings of Tucson. What was designed as a bid to 
dramatically expand the scope of Great American's branches and business 
activities instead has brought the S&amp;L, with its 213 branches and $15.9 
billion in assets, to the brink of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
Great American thus joins a growing list of hundreds of once-successful thrifts 
that have fallen on hard times in recent years, part of a massive S&amp;L 
debacle that could easily cost taxpayers upwards of $200 billion to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
But the downfall of the San Diego thrift is not your typical story of thrift 
failure. Its downfall was not due to fraud or questionable activities by 
industry outsiders, or due to investments in risky junk bonds or pie-in-the-sky 
real estate developments. Instead, it was due to simple mistakes and 
miscalculations by an experienced management team that had been well-respected 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the thrift's problems have dimmed the considerable prestige of the 
64-year-old Luce, scion of a pioneer San Diego family and benefactor to various 
local arts and community causes. 
</P>
<P>
In his 1986 annual report to shareholders, Luce said the acquisition of the 
Arizona S&amp;L, with its $2.4 billion in assets and 41 branches, would enable 
Great American to buy its way into a booming state where population, personal 
income and economic growth was far outstripping the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Great American bought into an economic black hole, an 
overbuilt and deflating real estate market whose problems have yet to bottom. 
On Tuesday, Great American announced that its growing heap of bad loans, most 
acquired through the Arizona deal, had weakened it to the point that it faces a 
possible seizure by regulators unless it can merge with another financial 
institution or raise $350 million in outside capital by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
An extended review by auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche of Great American's 
fourth-quarter and full-year 1989 financial statements resulted in the S&amp;L 
taking bad-loan loss provisions for 1989 totaling $405 million, the bulk of 
which were attributed to the Arizona portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The write-offs brought Great American's 1989 loss to $263.4 million, leaving it 
severely deficient in all three capital adequacy tests applied by the 
government as required by last summer's S&amp;L bailout bill. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight enables anyone to observe that Great American's move across state 
lines into Arizona had all the makings of a debacle because it overlooked the 
principle that successful real estate lending is built on management's 
first-hand knowledge of local markets. 
</P>
<P>
But even when Great American proposed the Arizona acquisition, the deal raised 
the hackles of regulators and some analysts. A spokesman for the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board said at the time that a merger of the sort proposed by Great 
American "generally speaking has not been permitted." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the inherent risks involved, regulatory policy up to that point was 
"not to approve across-state-line mergers," S&amp;L stock analyst Allan Bortel 
said then, although he pointed out there was no formal rule against the 
mergers. 
</P>
<P>
Misgivings notwithstanding, regulators approved the move. And Great American 
wasn't through with out-of-state deals. In 1987, it acquired Capital Savings of 
Olympia, Wash., which then operated 37 branches in Washington and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's strategy of expanding through out-of-state mergers contrasted 
sharply with that of HomeFed Bank, Great American's San Diego-based rival, 
which now has $18 billion in assets. HomeFed has stubbornly stuck to a 
California-only growth plan and in the process has remained healthy. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for Great American's Arizona acquisition to go sour. The 
S&amp;L's 1987 provisions for bad loans totaled $45 million, up 80% from the 
previous year, with the S&amp;L citing Arizona problems as the major cause. 
Things went rapidly downhill from there, with loan-loss provisions reaching 
$119.8 million in 1988 and $405 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
With so many of its loans in trouble, Great American's interest-rate spread -- 
its loan income less the amount it pays to depositors -- has become 
progressively thinner. For the nine months ended last Sept. 30, Great 
American's spread was only 0.62 percentage points, significantly less than the 
2-to-2.5-point spread seen at healthy S&amp;Ls, said William C. Ferguson, a 
Washington-based consultant to banks and S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's interest-rate spread as of Sept. 30, for example, was 2.02 points, 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
The future looks decidedly bleak for Great American. Analysts see an 
acquisition by a larger bank such as Wells Fargo or Security Pacific -- both of 
which say they've taken a look at Great American -- as the best alternative for 
shareholders. Each bank in the past year has targeted San Diego for expansion. 
Security Pacific had done it through acquisitions of Southwest Bancorp of Vista 
and La Jolla Bank &amp; Trust, while Wells Fargo is in the process of acquiring 
Torrey Pines Bank of Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
If it is interested, Wells Fargo probably would have the inside track in buying 
Great American because of the bank's strong stock price, which is increasingly 
becoming the currency used by bankers to acquire other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
But pessimists say potential buyers may wait for regulators to seize the 
S&amp;L and take responsibility for the Arizona problems before making offers.

FTC PROBING 2 STUDIOS' BAN OF ON-SCREEN ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy over on-screen advertising in the nation's movie theaters has 
moved to the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Justice Department on Wednesday confirmed a report that the 
FTC is investigating policies of Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros. for 
potential restraint of trade. Both studios have banned advertising from 
theaters where their movies are shown. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC would neither confirm nor deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice Department spokesman Joe Krovisky acknowledged that Fred Haynes, 
who runs the antitrust division's motion picture section, revealed the 
investigation during a recent board meeting of the National Assn. of Theater 
Owners in Washington. Krovisky said Justice knew of the FTC investigation 
because both agencies check with each other to avoid duplicated efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both Disney and Warner said Wednesday that the studios have not 
been contacted by the FTC and would not comment on its investigation, which was 
reported Wednesday in Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is what some theater owners believe is their right to offset their 
costs by showing commercials, while both Disney and Warner have cited the 
public's alleged antipathy toward on-screen ads. Both companies said they would 
allow theaters' existing advertising contracts to run their course before 
initiating the ban on ads. 
</P>
<P>
Disney and Warner policies forbid all advertising on screens after the lights 
go down but make an exception for public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Variety report said Warner would make an exception for Los Angeles 
Times ads shown in Mann Theaters, a chain whose parent company, Cineamerica 
Theaters, is jointly owned by Warner and Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barry Reardon, Warner president of domestic theatrical distribution, 
denied that report. He said he hasn't yet "addressed the Los Angeles Times" 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 theaters in Los Angeles and Orange counties show commercials for 
The Times in exchange for reduced advertising rates in the paper.

Simmons Sues Lockheed: Fulfilling a threat he made Monday, Texas investor 
Harold C. Simmons filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
alleging that Lockheed's recent corporate election was illegal and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, who lost his proxy fight for control of Lockheed, claims that shares 
from a Lockheed employee stock ownership plan were illegally and improperly 
used to ensure victory by the company's incumbent slate of directors over 
Simmons' rival slate. "This action seeks to restore integrity to the recent 
election of Lockheed's board of directors and to ensure integrity in future 
elections," Simmons said in his lawsuit. The suit was filed on behalf of 
Houston-based NL Industries, which Simmons controls.

APPLE NET JUMPS 134% TO $131.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing strong foreign sales and its cost-cutting efforts, personal computer 
pioneer Apple Computer said Wednesday that profits in its second quarter rose 
134% to $131.8 million on a revenue jump of about 8%. 
</P>
<P>
For the period ended March 31, sales were $1.34 billion, compared to $1.24 
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Profits in the prior-year period were $56.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Apple's performance surprised most analysts who had projected earnings about 
10% to 20% lower. "It's a blowout number," Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Eugene 
Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Cupertino-based company laid off about 400 workers, about 3% 
of its work force, because its sales had stalled and costs were rising quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Chairman and Chief Executive John Sculley singled out the company's 
surging international sales, noting that foreign activity accounted for 47% of 
total sales in the period, compared with 40% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley said that while he is optimistic about international demand for the 
rest of the fiscal year, he remains cautious regarding sales growth in the 
United States. Early this year he cut the company's 1990 revenue growth 
projections in half to 10% based on signals that the U.S. computer market was 
slowing. CARLA LAZZARESCHI

HEADQUARTERS SALE BOOSTS NORTHROP INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Corp. earned $96 million on sales of $1.2 billion in the first 
quarter, an increase in profit that was mostly attributable to the sale of its 
headquarters building, the firm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace company posted a $67.1-million after-tax gain on the sale of the 
complex in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Northrop said net income was increased by $10.7 million pretax by 
investment earnings from the firm's pension fund. Under accounting rules, a 
company must post as earnings certain excess investment income from an 
over-funded pension fund, which applies to Northrop, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding that benefit and the gain from the building sale, Northrop still 
increased its profits over the anemic $9.7 million it reported in last year's 
first quarter, when the firm took a $26-million charge against profits on an 
electronics program. 
</P>
<P>
The company also noted that it reduced it debt to $881 million on March 31 from 
$1.13 billion.

OCCIDENTAL CORP. PROFIT IS UP 62% 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Wednesday that its first-quarter profit rose 
62% despite a $96-million tumble in earnings from its chemical division. 
</P>
<P>
Combined results from oil, natural gas and gas transmission operations rose by 
$98 million, offsetting the lower chemical division profits, Occidental said. 
</P>
<P>
The big oil, chemical and agribusiness company said it earned $108 million, 
compared to $67 million in the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue increased by 2% to $5.2 billion from $5.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Higher worldwide crude oil prices, higher domestic natural gas and natural gas 
liquids prices and the resumption of oil production in the North Sea helped 
push oil and gas division earnings to $100 million, compared to $35 million in 
the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 results also reflected a $36-million pretax gain from the settlement 
of a claim against Venezuela stemming from the 1975 nationalization of 
Occidental operations.

ASHTON-TATE LINKS LOSS TO FAILED PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Blaming its continuing failure to ship a corrected new version for its popular 
dBase software program, Ashton-Tate said Wednesday that it lost $1 million in 
the first quarter on sales that declined 25% from the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were $57 million, compared to $89.8 million last year, when profits were 
$11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the Torrance company that has 
been plagued with problems since releasing an error-riddled update of its 
franchise-making dBase program in October, 1988. That prompted analysts to 
revive speculation about the ability of the company to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate Chairman Edward Esber on Wednesday did not rule out the possibility 
of a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the pending merger of Lotus Development and Novell into what would be 
the industry's largest operation, Esber said Ashton-Tate could be attractive to 
the right partner. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule out anything," Esber said, adding that the company has 5 
million users of its dBase programs and that at its current market valuation, 
the company's stock is selling for about $70 per user. "That's less than the 
cost of a sales call." CARLA LAZZARESCHI

SOCIETY: SAN DIEGO OPERA ASSN. ENDS SEASON ON A VIENNESE NOTE

Iris Strauss said she designed the dinner preceding Saturday's opening night 
performance of "The Magic Flute" to capture some of the surrealistic nuances of 
the sets and costumes designed by artist Maurice Sendak. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sense of anticipation among the 220 guests assembled in the 
Versailles Room at the Westgate Hotel rose to such a pitch that, had she chosen 
to pursue a line of Mozartian mischief, dinner chairman Strauss could have 
followed the opera's story line and served water and stone rather than wine and 
salmon without provoking too much of a commotion. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the poached salmon with cucumbers and the apple strudel, both nods 
to the German overtones of the piece, went over well. Because of the 7 p.m. 
curtain at the Civic Theatre, guests were forced to sit down at 5:30 p.m., a 
dinner hour that many of them found sufficiently surrealistic in itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the sedate glee that pervaded the ballroom and foyer, San Diego 
Opera Assn. President Esther Burnham, nearing retirement after three years in 
the post, said she felt a touch of melancholy -- not that she blamed it on 
Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always sad at the end of a season, and especially this year since it's the 
end of our 25th anniversary season," she said. "But Ian (opera general director 
Ian Campbell) planned very well for the occasion by scheduling an opera that 
would send all of us home happy." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Campbell expressed utter satisfaction with the close of his 
seventh season as general director. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's opera is a superb way for us to close," said Campbell. "It's been 
our most successful season ever, and the San Diego Opera is on a roll, there's 
no doubt about that. The 25th anniversary season was given a great boost by 
opening with "Boris Godunov" and the Soviet Arts Festival, and tonight is a 
great finish. I couldn't be more pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell spoke to the crowd during dinner and exhorted it not to behave too 
well at the performance. "We had 2,000 schoolchildren at the final dress 
rehearsal the other night," he said, adding, "They raised the roof, and I want 
you to do the same." 
</P>
<P>
The evening was a long one for some of the guests (many of whom observed 
Campbell's prohibition of inhibitions and loudly exhibited their pleasure with 
the performance), since a number were invited to a post-opera cast party at a 
Banker's Hill home. Among those invited to join "Magic Flute" stars Hei-Kyung 
Hong and Denes Gulyas for an hour of Viennese gemutlichkeit were weight-loss 
magnate Jenny Craig and her husband, Sid; Opera Assn. President-elect Steven 
Wall with Franne Ficara; Wendy McBride with Dennis Muckerman; Arlene and Newt 
Pollock; Dorene and John Whitney; Trude and Hermann Zillgens; Lee and Frank 
Goldberg, Irene Allis, Mary and James Hickey, and Marion Bateson. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list at the Westgate dinner included Joan and Irwin Jacobs, Patty and 
Dan Evatts, Matt Strauss, Barbara and Neil Kjos, Allison and Robert Price, 
Shelia Davis with Larry Lawrence, Sophie and Arthur Brody, Sandra and Douglas 
Pay, Lee and P. J. Maturo, Charmaine and Maury Kaplan, and Athena and Charles 
May. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar has been a little slow of late, and one reason may be that many 
are catching a bit of breath before plunging into the planned social maelstrom 
that, if it goes according to schedule, will make the last 10 days of April 
seem like one endless party. Just why this decade of days should be so crowded 
with events is unclear, but it is a schedule that offers something for anyone 
who wants to go out to support a cause, or simply to share a dance floor with a 
crowd of like-minded souls. 
</P>
<P>
This miniature social season starts April 21 with the 1990 University Ball, the 
first-ever gala fund-raiser to be given for the newly founded California State 
University, San Marcos. University President Bill Stacy will serve as honorary 
chair, and the evening will honor Carol Cox, chairman of the sponsoring 
President's Advisory Council. The reception in the ballroom at the Rancho 
Bernardo Inn will begin at 6:30 p.m. and will be followed by dinner and 
dancing. Tickets to the black tie event cost $125 per person; for further 
information, telephone the university. 
</P>
<P>
Four men have been invited to break the gender barrier that excluded men from 
participation in the first 15 annual "Spirit of San Diego" fashion luncheons 
given by La Jolla's All Hallows Women's Guild. The 16th such event, titled "The 
Way We Are!" will be given April 26 in the Aventine Ballroom at the Hyatt 
Regency and will honor 42 community volunteers from as many organizations, 
including Mercy Hospital Foundation President James Mulvaney and San Diego Boys 
and Girls Clubs President Michael Alessio. The luncheon will open with an 11 
a.m. reception, to be followed by lunch and a fashion show to be coordinated by 
Neiman Marcus West Coast fashion director David Cardoza. Tickets to the event 
cost $45 per person; for further information, call the All Hallows Catholic 
Church office. 
</P>
<P>
Also on April 26, the first annual "Tradition of Caring" award dinner will be 
held in the Marina Ballroom at the San Diego Marriott under the sponsorship of 
the Central Advisory Board of the Salvation Army in San Diego County. Banker 
Robert Adelizzi and his wife, Tommi, will receive the first "Tradition of 
Caring" award in recognition of their community service, and guests at the 
black tie-optional dinner will be entertained by the San Diego Master Chorale. 
The evening will commence with a reception at 6:30 p.m. Tickets cost $125 per 
person; for further information, call the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
The week will draw to a frantic close Saturday, April 28, when three major 
galas and several dinner dances will compete to draw the largest attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The longest-running of these, the annual "Celebrities Cook for the UCSD Cancer 
Center," will present its ninth version as "A Feast of Flowers" and will open 
with an elaborate presentation of hors d'oeuvres prepared by seven professional 
women chefs and as many amateurs, all also women. 
</P>
<P>
Among the professionals will be Evan Kleiman of the Angeli Caffe in Los 
Angeles, Anne Rosenzweig of Arcadia in New York and Joyce Goldstein of San 
Francisco's Square One. Dinner and dancing will follow the tasting. Tickets to 
the black tie event, which will begin with a 7 p.m. reception and will be given 
in the Champagne Ballroom at the Sheraton Harbor Island, cost $200, $350 and 
$500 per person; for further information, call the UCSD Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Regional Board of the National Kidney Foundation of Southern 
California will present the eighth annual "Orient Express Gala" on April 28th 
in the Grand Ballroom of the U.S. Grant hotel. 
</P>
<P>
As always, this formal event will take a fantasy excursion aboard the "The King 
of Trains and Train of Kings" as its theme, and the program and dinner will 
suggest a journey from London to Istanbul. Tickets cost $250, $500 and $1,000 
per person, and guests are invited to substitute 1920s attire for black tie. 
The gala will begin at 7 p.m.; for further information, call the Kidney 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Also on April 28, the University of San Diego will stage its annual USD Deans' 
Ball at the San Diego Hilton.

ARCHITECTURE: UCSD MAKES GOOD CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1988, when University of California regents approved plans for a new 
architecture school at the University of California, San Diego, the speculation 
about its direction began. 
</P>
<P>
Would the university go the safe route and lure a seasoned academic away from 
some respected Eastern institution? Or might they take a chance with a 
visionary? 
</P>
<P>
By selecting Philadelphia architect Adele Naude Santos to head the new 
undergraduate and graduate architecture programs, subject to approvals expected 
next month from the Faculty Senate and UC's Board of Regents, administrators at 
UCSD have given the new architecture program a shot at becoming something 
special. 
</P>
<P>
One of her first tasks will be to "search for the best faculty we can find in 
the world," Santos said. Initially, she hopes to hire three professors. She 
said the master's program may start first, although Ticho said undergraduate 
classes could begin next year. The graduate program will begin in the fall of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I was attracted by UCSD's desire to do something original. Architectural 
education has been in the doldrums for a long time. Here is a chance to do 
something unusual. The reports I read on the formation of the school were 
really interesting. Good thinking had taken place. There was a genuine interest 
in trying to not only be excellent, but in innovative ways. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question in education is whether we've done the best we can do. I 
don't think we have. There are flaws in the methods by which we teach. The 
methods we're using in graduate fast-track programs are the same as they used 
when I got my architectural education in six years. 
</P>
<P>
"What UCSD has been saying is, 'Here we are a major research institution, we 
would like to think of an architecture school engaged in research.' That isn't 
something that's been tried." 
</P>
<P>
Santos envisions several possible areas for research, everything from 
industrial to environmental design, from the design of entire buildings to 
pieces of buildings to new modes of suburban development. Before deciding on 
Santos, a 15-member selection committee that included several local architects 
pared a list of more than 100 candidates down to two finalists: Santos and 
William McMinn, dean of the architecture school at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
The two offered quite different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Santos is South Africa-born and raised. She is a practicing architect and an 
experienced educator. Her undergraduate work was at the Architectural Assn. in 
London, and she went on to earn graduate degrees from Harvard and the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
She practiced primarily in South Africa from 1968 through the early '70s, then 
spent the rest of the decade working on a a variety of academic and design 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
From 1981 to 1987, she chaired the architecture department at the University of 
Pennsylvania. But unlike academics who make a living in architecture without 
hoisting a drafting pencil, Santos has a long history of designing buildings 
that consistently earn praise from her peers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of her work is in Japan, which made her even more appealing to a fledgling 
design school on the opposite rim of the Pacific Ocean. For Misawa Homes in 
Japan, she proposed new ways of using a ceramic building material. For SDC 
Corp., her largest Japanese client, she has designed five buildings and is 
working on a sixth, including a home, offices and a boutique. 
</P>
<P>
McMinn, by contrast, built his reputation almost entirely on academic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
After heading the architecture department at Louisiana State University for 
four years during the early '70s, he went to Mississippi State University to 
head a new school of architecture in 1974. He stayed for 10 years, and the 
school grew up successfully, said a member of UCSD's selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, McMinn has been dean of architecture at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
Though the most interesting choice for UCSD seems obvious, the office of UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson, which made the ultimate decision, at one time 
favored McMinn, according to one insider. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Chancellor Harold Ticho, who spearheaded the selection process for the 
chancellor's office after the committee made its recommendations, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Whether administrators made an inspired choice, or whether the gods somehow 
gave Santos a last-minute push, her selection seems divine. She combines years 
of educational experience with a genuine interest in design, research and the 
many pertinent social issues facing architects today. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she won a competition to design 40 units of affordable housing for a 
site in a dense Hollywood neighborhood, one of several low-cost housing designs 
she's become known for. The simple yet elegant housing modules she proposed, 
with their barrel-vaulted roofs, private courtyards and abundant natural light, 
stood out as mature design solutions next to the trendy creations submitted by 
her competitors. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's selection committee was clearly enticed by Santos, which isn't 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
This week, she personally telephoned a reporter just to say she would be 
delayed 15 minutes in giving a promised telephone interview. That kind of 
humility is a rare asset in an age of egotistical architectural superstars. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with the creative sparkle in her eyes," said architect Rob 
Quigley, a member of the selection committee. "She seems like someone who can 
size up a situation and take charge quickly. I was also impressed because she's 
very concerned with the substantial issues of architecture, yet not illiterate 
in the more aesthetic issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Her interest in Japan is very significant. She's open to an interface with 
Mexico. Some of the people we interviewed were in fact Hispanic, but much less 
intrigued with the geographic and cultural potential we have for setting up 
unique liaisons with Mexico." (Santos' surname is from her former husband, 
architect Antonio de Souza Santos.) 
</P>
<P>
Quigley was a guest lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania for two months 
last year. He never met Santos there, but he did get a strong sense of the kind 
of architecture school she helped shape during the '80s at a school defined in 
the '60s under the leadership of romantic modernist Louis Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a real emphasis on the human side of architecture," Quigley said. 
"They were really concerned with broader issues of architecture, and lots of 
Ivy League schools aren't." 
</P>
<P>
"Kahn never taught me," said Santos, "but I was there when he was the leading 
guru. I think he was a very important architect. If I learned anything from 
him, it was more in the spiritual sense, a kind of poetic vision that was very 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
This creative, reverential outlook intrigued the committee, who knew that the 
San Diego school's first months would be crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who takes this responsibility will set the tone for the next 
several decades," Quigley said. "She's the kind of person who makes things 
happen. The University of California system is such an overwhelming machine 
that once the school is entrenched, the options will be severely limited. When 
a new school like this is invented, you have a short grace period where there's 
lots of fresh air, opportunity, potential. We think she will seize the 
opportunity early on." 
</P>
<P>
Santos appealed to both young, aggressive designers like Quigley and mature 
veterans of the local architectural scene like Robert Mosher, also a member of 
the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
"She is absolutely at the top of list. As far as I was concerned, she has a 
superb background," Mosher said. "She supports the design studio concept, which 
many schools these days are not keen on. She believes in the value of history, 
all history, but especially architectural history. She also supports a strong 
undergraduate program." 
</P>
<P>
Her new job officially starts July 1. She plans to hire a partner to run her 
Philadelphia office, now in the midst of several important projects, including 
the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania and a large 
indoor swimming complex at Albright College in Reading, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
After stepping down as dean at Pennsylvania in 1987, where she continued to 
teach, Santos received numerous offers to head other architecture schools. But 
she wasn't interested. In fact, she didn't consider the San Diego job a strong 
possibility at first. 
</P>
<P>
"Merely being a dean as another feather in one's cap didn't interest me," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides designs using new materials, Santos has been working on solutions to 
social problems for Misawa Homes. 
</P>
<P>
One experimental housing complex, proposed for a dense urban site, would use 
"sky terraces" to provide residents with light and their own small swatches of 
outdoor space. Another prototype would house several generations of a family. 
The San Diego housing industry could use such a dose of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
At UCSD, Santos hopes to have a hand in shaping campus architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a role to play. It's very important that there be a representative 
of the architecture school in the group that looks at campus architecture and 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, of course, Santos will be involved with the design and construction 
of UCSD's first building for the new school, which is included in the 
university's construction plans for the next five years. No money has been 
allocated. 
</P>
<P>
In Santos, who said she is committed to the new job for at least the five to 
seven years it will take to launch the school properly, UCSD has landed a 
leader with the potential to make great things happen.

PRESCHOOL: AT THE YOUNG NATURALIST CENTER, TODDLERS LEARN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT 
IN A BACK YARD PARADISE.

<P>
It is a tropical Brazilian rain forest complete with howler monkeys and 
jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
It is a desert plain where chipmunks and ground squirrels hibernate. And in the 
spring, it is a garden of wild flowers. 
</P>
<P>
It is a place where Australian aborigines live. 
</P>
<P>
And it is Marti Harmon's Studio City back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Harmon, 46, has used her back yard to operate the Young Naturalist 
Center -- an alternative to traditional day care or preschool. Harmon is an 
environmental educator who incorporates an appreciation for nature into the 
everyday curriculum of her pre-kindergarten children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like bringing your kids here is just some yuppie thing to do," said 
Abbie Phillips, whose 5-year-old son, Ben, attends the school. "Young children 
need to know about the environment and what's happening to it." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a member of the National Audubon Society, dreams of incorporating 
similar environmental techniques into the classroom curriculum of young 
children throughout the country. Recently, Harmon shared her philosophy with 
educators in a native American community in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, I would like to see all children learn by appreciating the world 
around them," Harmon said. "Just like the children here appreciate this big 
back yard and the world it represents." 
</P>
<P>
Just one block east of busy Coldwater Canyon Avenue, the Young Naturalist 
Center is a serene place surrounded by a 6-foot cedar fence that allows the 
children to leave an increasingly hectic world behind. Butterflies and 
hummingbirds flit about and classical music wafts overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon's back yard is a child's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Juniper trees stand bunched together in one corner of the yard, completely 
shading a classroom-sized grassy area. This is the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
A basket of stuffed animals is nearby. These are the toucans, howler monkeys, 
jaguars and marpho butterflies of the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
It is 2 p.m. and nap time has just ended. 
</P>
<P>
Eight children tumble from the house and sit on the porch to lace up their 
tennis shoes. They have dirt smudges on their knees. Their clothes have a used 
played-in look. They have healthy complexions and when Harmon gives the OK they 
race to the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a howler monkey, I live in the trees!" says 4-year-old Joanna. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a jaguar, strongest animal of the rain forest!" 4-year-old Will responds. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, who earned her master's degree in human development at Pacific Oaks 
College in Pasadena, walks over to the group and picks up a stuffed rabbit. 
Someone has accidentally left him perched in the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Where does the rabbit go, does anyone know?" she asks and a 5-year-old named 
Ben jumps down from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"He lives in the ground in a temperate forest," Ben says, setting the rabbit 
gingerly in a child-made burrow. "We better put him down here so he's safe." 
</P>
<P>
It is a world of imagination and make-believe with a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dianne Philibosian, a Cal State Northridge professor who serves on 
the governor's commission for child care, Harmon's Young Naturalist Center has 
several benefits for young children. 
</P>
<P>
Philibosian said that such a center offering hands-on experience teaches 
children how to interact in an interdependent world. It also heightens the 
children's sense of fantasy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a wonderful way for them to categorize animals, to learn the difference 
between fish and monkeys and ground squirrels," said Philibosian, who has never 
visited the Young Naturalist Center but is familiar with Harmon's techniques. 
"There are not enough schools doing this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Philibosian added that the most important lesson children can learn from such a 
center is the value of other forms of life. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The children feel like they are playing all day, but in fact they are learning 
a respect for their environment and the environment of other cultures," said 
Harmon, who has two teen-age children. "This way it is integrated into their 
playtime and they learn it much more quickly than if they were sitting in a 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Before the children tire of the rain forest, Harmon steers them toward an 
organic vegetable garden next to the house. The garden is a flourishing 
assortment of lettuce, oregano, radishes and carrots. At snack time, the 
children eat what they harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"We use no pesticides," Harmon said, pointing to a tiny wooden table covered 
with potting soil and red and blue shovels. "I think there is something about a 
child getting his hands in the dirt that keeps the snails away." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Harmon hands each child a wicker basket and asks them to walk 
through the Silent Forest and pick herbs and nuts for the baby Australian 
aborigines. The Silent Forest is an area made up of an aging blue spruce tree, 
elderberry trees and a towering paper mulberry tree. Here, the children must 
play and talk very quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place where they can reflect and be in tune with themselves," Harmon 
said. "It's very important in the world that we live in that they take time to 
reflect in this kind of surrounding." 
</P>
<P>
Once the herbs and nuts are collected, Harmon whisks the children to an orange 
nylon tent near the house. Different-colored plastic dolls fill the tent and 
Harmon hands each child one. These are the aborigines. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I be a daddy and carry the baby on my back like they do in Australia?" 
5-year-old Alex asks? And Harmon's assistant, Cheryl Osborne, takes a section 
of a white sheet and wraps a doll on Alex's back, where it remains until Alex's 
mother comes to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., the children are ready for arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
All art projects are done in three-dimensional form and involve materials that 
can be recycled and natural materials. Today, the children are designing their 
own rain forests, using tempera nontoxic paints to color empty paper-towel 
rolls and bunches of dried straw. 
</P>
<P>
When their hands become smudged with paint or mud, the children run across the 
yard to a large bucket of water and rinse them off. This way, Harmon is 
teaching them to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
The parents see Harmon as a living anachronism of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The children see her as the world's best grown-up. 
</P>
<P>
She dresses in tennis shoes, sweat pants and colorful oversized T-shirts. Her 
brown curly hair loosely frames green eyes that are every bit as alive as those 
of the children. When it's time to crawl on the ground and learn what it's like 
to be a ground squirrel, Harmon leads the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Thompson-Norman is a parent who interviewed several people at various 
preschool centers before deciding on the Young Naturalist Center. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the schools have this strict emphasis on reading and writing and 
kindergarten preparedness," Thompson-Norman said. "They make getting ready for 
kindergarten like getting ready for college. Harmon hasn't forgotten that kids 
like to play." 
</P>
<P>
And somehow amid all the play time, Thompson-Norman said her son is learning 
more than his neighborhood peers. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes home and tells me about desert plains and rain forests and the 
problems with malathion spraying," Thompson-Norman said of her 5-year-old son, 
Paul. "His reading and writing are coming along beautifully and he doesn't feel 
all stressed out about kindergarten starting later this year." 
</P>
<P>
Parents are willing to pay a steep price for Harmon's center. She charges $6 an 
hour. If a child were to attend the center three full days a week, it would 
cost $576 per month. Consequently, most of the parents do not work full time 
and only leave their children with Harmon a few days each week. 
</P>
<P>
Like everything else, discipline is handled in a unique way at the Young 
Naturalist Center. Children are never benched or set apart from their peers. 
Instead, Harmon and afternoon teacher Pam Hayward encourage the children to 
talk over their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"We are teaching the kids to be autonomous rather than running to adults and 
tattling on another child," said Hayward, a licensed marriage-family counselor. 
"They have words to work things out verbally. It makes them very gentle." 
</P>
<P>
And all children must follow Harmon's only house rule: No violent play. A child 
must not do anything that hurts the environment or another child. 
</P>
<P>
This applies to activities indoors and out. Inside Harmon's house, dozens of 
pillows are tossed on a hardwood floor and reading shelves overflow with 
children's environmental books. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are so mellow here compared to children at other day-care centers" 
that she interviewed, said Phillips, who also brought her daughter, Sadie, to 
the center and has known Harmon for five years. "They have verbal tools and can 
really express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said she and her husband, a child psychiatrist, have spent many hours 
wondering why Harmon is so successful with the children. 
</P>
<P>
"But the answer is really quite simple," Phillips said. "Marti is still a kid 
herself."

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Larsen uses the same creativity he tapped to design the popular Teddy 
Ruxpin talking bear when he teaches third-graders origami, the Japanese art of 
paper folding. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, whose son Matthew is a fourth-grade student at Justice Avenue School in 
West Hills, said that sitting at a table teaching the children a hands-on 
activity allows him a chance to make learning real. 
</P>
<P>
"When I designed Teddy Ruxpin, I asked myself how I could make the best 
possible thing, applying all that I am and know, using something so simple -- a 
model airplane motor -- to make something unique," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who have done other things in life -- aside from teaching -- can 
share those experiences. Kids can learn the name of the planets, but an 
astronaut can tell them what it felt like to be in space," Larsen said. "The 
easiest, most effective form of education is involvement. So I try to make it 
real." 
</P>
<P>
It's that creative spirit -- and the chance to show children what they can do 
in the real world, using what they're learning now -- that Larsen and other 
parents hope to offer the children they volunteer to teach. 
</P>
<P>
But only a small percentage of parents actually volunteer in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
A study recently released by the National Parent-Teacher Assn. and the Dodge 
Division of Chrysler found that most parents, while they care about education 
and believe their role is extremely influential to learning, do little to help. 
And of those who do, a majority are more involved with fund-raising than in 
classroom instructional support or policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cynthia Desrochers, associate professor of education at Cal State 
Northridge, there is a body of information referred to by educators as the 
effective schools research, which shows that students in schools with parent 
involvement have higher levels of achievement than schools without such 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful parent involvement -- not baking cookies -- is the key," she said. 
"Effective schools also tend to have, in addition to parent involvement, a 
principal who is an instructional leader, an orderly, well-run school plant, 
and high academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I read says your kids are better off if you're visible," Desrochers 
said. "Teachers -- if they know a given five children in their class have 
active parents, for example -- are going to look at these kids with a keener 
eye." 
</P>
<P>
Yet today most parents work, and for many there simply isn't much unclaimed 
time left to allow them to actively volunteer. How do schools attract them to 
do more than occasionally contribute to the PTA's bake sale or attend an open 
house? 
</P>
<P>
Some school administrators and parent volunteers have consciously tried to 
create a school environment that welcomes parent involvement on campus. Carla 
Nino, PTA president at Encino Avenue School and president-elect of the Los 
Robles Council PTA, said that in this school year, parents at Encino School 
have contributed more than 63,000 hours of volunteer time. The key, Nino said, 
to getting such a high level of involvement -- at a school that has almost 50% 
of its 630 member student body bused from other area schools -- is the 
principal's attitude and the openness in the school. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that the PTA is on an equal standing with the faculty at 
our school," she said, "and the parents' opinions are requested." 
</P>
<P>
The principal at Encino School, Orlando Martinez, 63, worked in Miami as a 
certified public accountant after fleeing Cuba in 1959. Moved by his volunteer 
experience there with refuge children, he decided to become a teacher, and has 
been employed by the Los Angeles Unified School District for 26 years. While 
teaching full time, he earned a master's degree and a doctorate in Spanish, and 
has been at Encino for the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that the only way to get parents to volunteer on campus is for 
the principal to actively recruit them. 
</P>
<P>
"You bring parents to a school. You show them in every chance you have that you 
like them. My doors are open. I spend a lot of time with parents; they are my 
clients. I have to treat them with respect. I am a public servant. It's that 
simple," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez added that he thinks it is that philosophy, coupled with the strength 
of the PTA, that brings more than 100 parent volunteers a week on campus to 
work in the classroom, teach aerobics, drama and dance, help in the computer 
room, run the library, assist on field trips, and tutor students. 
</P>
<P>
Other principals have similar philosophies. Bobbie Baugh, principal at Pomelo 
Drive School in West Hills, started out there six years ago with only eight 
parents who were interested in volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt then that the success of any program was with parents active in the 
school," she said. So the small group started staging get-acquainted lunches, 
brunches and potlucks to encourage parents to volunteer, and scheduled a 
new-family orientation every year to explain programs and volunteer 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that the way to measure our success was by having an increase in 
the number of parent volunteers at the school," said Baugh, whose 130 active 
volunteers -- out of a school of 596 students -- now teach cooking and drill 
team classes, support the school's Getty Art program, provide classroom 
tutoring, teaching and support, and conduct special school spirit events. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Markowitz, 37, who has two daughters at Pomelo, was once a physical 
education teacher at Birmingham High. When Baugh heard that Markowitz had been 
a drill team coach, she recruited her as a volunteer to start and run the 
school's 65-student drill team for girls from kindergarten to fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
The drill team meets after school for an hour a week and performs at least one 
show a month school-wide. Markowitz said she loves the time she spends with the 
drill team and feels the program helps the children build confidence and 
self-esteem, develop good posture, learn to memorize routines and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"What I love about Pomelo is that here, everything's for the kids. And I also 
like volunteering because I can see what's happening at the school." 
</P>
<P>
Learning more about the school and having a chance to see the classrooms up 
close are reasons many parents cite for volunteering their time. "I like to see 
what's going on in the classroom," said Robin Little of Sherman Oaks, who has 
one son in kindergarten at Sherman Oaks School and another in the third grade 
at Kester Avenue Gifted and High Achieving Magnet in Van Nuys. She works part 
time, but volunteers in the classroom and in fund-raising at both schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids don't always tell you what goes on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Little also said she has seen some parents who seem ineffective in the 
classroom and warned that classroom participation doesn't work for all teachers 
or all parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think every parent has an absolute right to work with kids in the 
class. The teacher does have a right to control the classroom," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Little said she has seen some parents be disruptive in the classroom, "being 
too buddy-buddy with the kids, or noisy. And some parents, any time anything 
happens in the classroom that they question, they call the school office. I 
have sympathy for teachers," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said he basically 
wants parents to support the classroom teacher by giving the children a good 
night's sleep and good food. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't particularly need parents' help in the classroom," he said. "If 
the teachers want the parents' help and they can work that out, that's fine. 
But we're leery of a program where a parent knocks on the door and says, 'I'm 
your parent, and I'm going to teach your class today,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some parents see their role as crucial, both in the classroom and in school 
site policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
Bea Stotzer, president of the PTA at Kester Avenue School, said that "without 
the direct involvement of parents in the school, how do we know it's effective 
for the kids? The teachers are responsible for our children's achievement but 
they are not accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Stotzer said that teachers who don't want parents in the classroom are afraid 
of being forced to answer to their customers, the parents. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many parents first get involved in the classroom not so much to observe or 
oversee, but rather to offer help, Sidney Farivar, assistant professor of 
elementary education at CSUN, said that most of the volunteering she sees in 
schools is either clerical assistance -- cutting up paper for art projects, 
grading multiple-choice tests -- or teaching mini-courses that provide 
enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet once there, parents can get caught up in what they see. "A lot of people 
like to volunteer in the classroom because they think it may help their child 
if they can function as a line-blocker," said Farivar. "Some of it is spying to 
see what is going on in the classroom. And then you have a lot of gossiping 
going on between parents, comparing one child to another," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Farivar said she is not only concerned that parents can sometimes say or do 
inappropriate things in the classroom, but also that privacy issues come up 
when parents compare notes with one another. 
</P>
<P>
She also said the schools that have the most affluent parents may have more 
involvement, but the teachers pay for it by having to field more questions from 
parents. She said parents are volunteering in the schools partly to evaluate 
them, weighing whether their local public school is satisfactory or whether 
they should change to a private school. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing this whole me-generation growing up and wanting the best for 
their children," Farivar said. "They're saying, 'I want you, the teacher, to be 
accountable to me.' A lot of teachers don't want to deal with that. They want 
parents out of the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at the schools with a lot of parent involvement, however, seem 
to be working to encourage teachers to become comfortable with the concept of 
the parent as partner. Lois Bloch, site administrator at Justice Avenue School, 
said that she looks at the school as a partnership. "We all have a mutually 
owned interest in the child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who has been at the campus for 1 1/2 years, credits parent involvement 
for the turnaround the school has recently enjoyed. "Two years ago, the school 
had a lot of negatives and was suffering from low self-esteem," she said, 
referring to the campus's unique all-metal buildings that make both hot and 
cold days more difficult to bear and to an enrollment so low that the school 
didn't qualify for a principal. 
</P>
<P>
But now Justice has more than 450 students -- half of whom are bused from 
overcrowded schools -- and a force of 30 to 35 active volunteers. 
Parent-sponsored programs range from semi-annual career days to a recent bike 
rodeo, an after-school and lunch-hour library program, parent-organized field 
trips and a monthly enrichment day. 
</P>
<P>
What Bloch has been telling the parents she recruits for the school, she tells 
the teachers as well: "I really believe in the self-fulfilling prophecy: You're 
as good as you see yourself being." She added that when she came to Justice, 
the school had a nucleus of parents who were looking for someone to make it 
work, and together they've built from there. 
</P>
<P>
For many parents, the greatest benefits of volunteering include not just the 
hope of greater student achievement, but also the joy their own children 
experience from seeing their mothers and fathers on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Desrochers, who sometimes volunteers at her daughter Vanessa's school in Los 
Angeles, said that when she taught a mini-course in making clay planters to her 
daughter's class, Vanessa was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she knows I can teach, and it's a bond we share because we did it together 
-- at school," Desrochers said.

BEST BETS: JAZZ, SLUGS ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether your taste leans toward the jazz music of Larry Carlton or the 
offerings of the Banana Slug String Band, Ventura County's April 21 Earth Day 
celebration will be packed with entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
If you know jazz, you probably know Carlton is a Grammy award-winner. But you 
may not know the slightest bit about the Banana Slugs. They are a San 
Francisco-based group that visits schools, children's festivals, parks and 
fairs using their music, puppetry and improvisational acting to convey 
environmental messages. 
</P>
<P>
These two acts will be joined by other musical entertainers throughout the day 
at Ventura Harbor Village from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The event is free to the 
public. For more information, call 643-0339.

FAMILY FARE THAI; 
</P>
<P>
THE FLAVOR OF THE SOUP ARRIVES IN THREE WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I can remember when Thai food was new to Los Angeles in the early '70s. Back 
then, I'd go with big groups of friends for major feasts. There was also a 
certain shock value. I seem to remember staggering out of the restaurants, 
mouth burning, face flushed and ears tingling. 
</P>
<P>
These are no longer the sensations I seek from Thai food. Now I'm more 
interested in savoring the subtle -- the combinations of sweet, sour, tangy and 
exotic that make up the marvelous Thai taste. It's what I was looking for when 
I took my family to Tipps Thai restaurant in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of mine told me to go there, assuring me that it was the best Thai 
restaurant in the Tri-County area. He especially recommended the spicy eggplant 
sauteed with garlic, chili and basil. He must have told everyone he met that 
week about Tipps, because when we arrived on a Saturday night the place was 
filled, and people were waiting for tables. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in a storefront on Ventura's thrift-shop row, Tipps has a surprisingly 
elegant dining room with booths upholstered in tropical fabric, blue 
tablecloths, pink napkins and peach walls. Low-hanging paper lanterns cast a 
rosy glow. As busy as it was, the place had the tranquillity of a private 
dining room, the kind of place that has a calming effect on children and 
encourages their best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
We started with a chicken-on-fire that came with pickled garlic sauce. It was 
wonderful, with a lemon-like flavor mixed with a delicate garlic taste that 
permeated the moist meat. We fought over the scraps of it. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken-coconut soup was not as creamy or sweet as some I've had, and I 
liked this one better. The chicken pieces were almost too big, but I liked the 
funny little fairy mushrooms. Spicy-and-sour shrimp soup was filled with exotic 
bits of green. The flavor of this soup arrived in three waves: first the sour, 
then the lemon grass and herbs, and finally the spiciness. 
</P>
<P>
By the time our entrees arrived, we would have liked clean plates. I had to 
shove aside chicken bones and shrimp tails to make room. An excellent 
deep-fried fish came with sauteed vegetables in a Thai-style curry sauce. Spicy 
fried rice was spiked with delicious cooked green peppers, beef, onions and 
fresh tomatoes. The ground chicken salad was weird, we all agreed, and 
wonderful -- all minty and lemony. 
</P>
<P>
I thought the seafood special had the best sauce of all; it had the flavors of 
ginger, mint, lemon grass and lots of cilantro. It came with mussels and nice 
squid, big pieces of fish and slightly bitter clams. The kids' favorite dish 
was the flat noodles with broccoli and beef in a fairly plain sauce. It came 
with a thick clump of noodles and the best broccoli I've ever had: bright green 
and slightly crunchy. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has a vegetarian menu as extensive as the regular menu. We tried 
the sweet-and-sour tofu. It didn't persuade me to switch to a tofu diet any 
time soon, but the sauce was delicious. 
</P>
<P>
As I was finally admitting to myself that I couldn't eat another bite -- my 
stomach had been telling me this for quite a while -- I realized we had 
completely forgotten to order the spicy eggplant. "Oh," I said to the waiter, 
"we'll have to come back." He smiled and nodded as if he heard this all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>

STRUMMING ALONG; 
</P>
<P>
 TRADITIONAL, UNAMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF EARLIER ERA ARE FINDING A NEW VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a balmy Tuesday night earlier this month, 250 people filed cheerfully into 
Ojai's Matilija Junior High School auditorium. They were a folk music crowd -- 
thirtyish and open-collared -- and they sat on hard wooden seats, facing a 
stage adorned with fiddle, guitar, Autoharp, piano and hammered dulcimer. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had come for John McCutcheon, the Virginia-based performer whose 
tools these were, but also for the tools themselves: Traditional musical 
instruments, challenged in the marketplace by high-technology these past few 
years, have come through as popular as ever in Ventura County and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have ended up like you," McCutcheon told the audience as he fingered 
his banjo. "I got good grades in school and all that. But I started playing the 
banjo, and everything started going to hell from then on." He was smiling, of 
course, and many in the crowd were smiling back. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I first heard Pete Seeger," McCutcheon, 37, said in an 
interview a few days before. "It was inviting, like saying, 'You can do this.' 
He never said that, but the message was there. 'You've got this wooden box with 
strings across it. And you can make music on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That sense of invitation still exists. Since 1987, musical instrument merchants 
nationwide have reported a resurgence in sales for unamplified instruments from 
guitars to drums. In 1988, the last year for which figures are available, an 
American Music Conference survey showed that acoustic guitar sales were up 26%. 
Bowed string instrument sales -- including violins, cellos and basses -- were 
up 12%. Percussion and wind instrument sales also rose, but less dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports followed several flat years in the mid-1980s, when many consumers 
were drawn to a new crop of electronic keyboard instruments and electric 
guitars. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the recording industry has found ready audiences for such 
acoustically oriented artists as singer-guitarist Tracy Chapman and 
singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby. Windham Hill Records, the Palo Alto "New Age" 
record label that was founded 14 years ago, reports annual sales of $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a revival in folk music, really," said Becky Lowe, who with her 
husband, Tom, has been presenting folk concerts around Ojai for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Lowes, who said they pass any profits along to the performers, organized 
McCutcheon's concert. In March, they brought a New England folk trio named 
Matamora to the Ojai Woman's Club and drew about 100 paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, the Lowes will again occupy the Woman's Club, this time to present 
Figgy Duff, a Newfoundland sextet that at various times employs accordion, 
harmonica, bouzouki (a mandolin-like instrument that originated in Greece), 
fiddle, guitar, hammered dulcimer, bodhran, flute, whistles, concertina, harp, 
keyboards and electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, the City Bakery presents occasional acoustic performances. On April 
27, folk singers Fred Starner and Larry Penn will play there. The cover charge 
is $3. On June 2, an appearance by the local group Acoustic Medicine is 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians can't always take this new interest to the bank; several local 
observers say they haven't noticed any particular increase audiences for 
acoustic concerts. But an unscientific local survey suggests that the acoustic 
revival has not left Ventura County behind. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars continue to outsell acoustics 2-to-1 at McCabe's Music in 
Santa Paula, by the estimate of clerk Marco Avelino, and a salesman estimated 
that acoustic guitar sales were up only slightly at Henson's Music Center in 
Oxnard. But at Henson's Music Center in Camarillo and Heck Music Center in 
Ventura, the story is different. 
</P>
<P>
"We are selling quite a few more acoustic guitars than we did, say, two years 
ago," said Andy Feldman, assistant manager at Henson's in Santa Paula. "I would 
say I sell three acoustics to every electric. Two years ago, it was probably 
two electrics to one acoustic." 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy Chapman came up," said saleswoman Daphne Jones at Heck Music Center, 
"and all of a sudden everybody was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Nadine Bunn, co-owner of Folk Mote Music in Santa Barbara -- which sells no 
electric instruments -- reports that her store's sales in the second half of 
1989 were up 15% over the second half of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chapman, a co-founder of the Old Time Fiddlers' Assn. in Ojai, estimates 
that the group's membership -- 380 players and enthusiasts -- has grown by 75 
or more in the last two years. From 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. on the second and fourth 
Sundays of every month, the association takes over the Oak View Community 
Center on Valley Road for jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of interest," said Seabury Gould, an Ojai guitarist and 
keyboard player who has been performing and teaching in Ventura County for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the signs of a good musician is that you can unplug him and he still 
sounds good," Gould said. "If a musician is completely relying on electronics, 
something is wrong. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McCutcheon started his set in the auditorium with a song about trains, 
suggesting somehow a train whistle with his banjo-picking. 
</P>
<P>
"And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow," he sang. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

NIGHT LIFE: THE CLUB SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
WEIRD FUN; 
</P>
<P>
LOOK OUT! HERE COMES THE DEVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rock band Devo features five weirdos from Ohio who have moved to 
California. Of course, New York and Texas, along with Ohio, are empty states 
now -- everyone from there is here, but that's another essay. 
</P>
<P>
How weird are these guys? How weird is there? As weird as eating beans before 
your dream date with Kim Basinger. Look in the dictionary under "weird," and 
Devo's picture is there. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe these Akron natives spent too much time breathing all those rubber fumes 
or maybe it's just more proof that it's no fun if you can't complain. And Devo 
has been complaining. For years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pro-information and anti-stupidity," says guitarist Mark Mothersbaugh. 
"It is the lack of the human mind, not nuclear bombs that we fear." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the point? Maybe it's just a way of getting people to think about 
things. Or perhaps its the old Can music save the world? question. But if the 
Moody Blues couldn't save the world, how can a bunch of artsy-smarty rockers 
from Ohio? 
</P>
<P>
Devo is best known for a series of totally bizarre videos beginning with "Jocko 
Homo" in 1976 and continuing to the present. There was also a memorable 
robotic-rock version of "Satisfaction" on an episode of Saturday Night Live. 
The theme of most of the videos is coming to grips with the impact of 
technology coupled with basic human stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
For Devo, the mission is to derail an alarming trend they see -- devolution. 
According to Mothersbaugh, "Devolution is the process where the human species 
will soon be a victim of self-genocide brought about by its own stupidity. . . 
. Devolution seems to explain what's happening after observing life on planet 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Devo may never play any Optimist Club gigs. But devolution nonetheless rolls on 
-- the destruction of the rain forests, rampant pollution, the 49ers beating 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain, not a lot of people will be going to the Ventura Theatre 
Thursday night to take notes. Most will dance. Devo rocks. It's techno-pop with 
a beat. And who knows, maybe they'll sell enough $22 T-shirts to afford a 
watch. Because if one of the band members had returned my last call, this 
would've been much longer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's a real rock 'n' roll dilemma tonight -- how can you be in four places 
at once when you're not anywhere at all? Devo's playing the Ventura Theatre, 
but if you've gotten this far, you knew that. Michael on Fire is in Thousand 
Oaks; Spencer The Gardener is in Santa Barbara and Elvin Bishop and others are 
in Isla Vista. If you somehow end up home watching "the Cosby Show," rock 'n' 
roll has passed you by. 
</P>
<P>
New albums you need right now: Eleventh Dream Day, The Stone Roses, That Petrol 
Emotion, The Chills, Ben Vaughn, Sinead O'Connor, House of Love, The Hangman's 
Beautiful Daughters and about a zillion more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And finally , unpack those flak jackets and steel pots and don't forget those 
dancing shoes, looks like Raging Arb and the Redheads will be at Charlie's on 
Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
The following local acts have tapes available at their gigs or else from the 
usual suspects: The Mudheads, Nothing, Durango 95, Spencer the Gardener, The 
I-Rails, J. Peter Boles, The Lion I's, and Evans and VanLoan.

TOURS DESIGN HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
REMODELING HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
REFURBISHED 1911 OXNARD BUNGALOW TO OPEN FOR SYMPHONY FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A rambling 1911 California Cottage-style home is located at the corner of 2nd 
and F streets in Oxnard on a broad parkway lined with mature Sycamore trees. It 
has been home to families who have shaped Ventura County's history. 
</P>
<P>
For the next month, it will be home to Design House '90, the Ventura County 
Symphony's eighth annual fund-raising event, which opens to the public on 
Saturday. A premiere party tomorrow night features tours by the designers, a 
catered tapas buffet, and a mariachi band, said Katherine Griffith Young, 
Design House chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Extensively remodeled over the years, the 14-room, single-story house at 205 S. 
F St., is now owned by George and Jurhee Fitzgibbons. It is the first Oxnard 
residence to be renovated by the Ventura County Symphony League. 
</P>
<P>
It sits on 2 1/2 city lots and was the first home built on F Street. With the 
public library, City Hall, and Santa Clara Catholic Church, it formed a hub of 
the Oxnard community. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a group of 24 Ventura County interior and landscape designers have 
worked three months to transform the house's 1950s decor and add modern 
conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
The charm of the California Arts and Crafts-style bungalow has been retained 
and even enhanced by renovations that include blonde hardwood floors, built-in 
cabinets, leaded glass windows, innovative tile work and wall coverings. A tour 
of the house should be accompanied by a stroll around this historic 
neighborhood, which contains many largely unmodified houses that are fine 
examples of the California and Craftsman bungalows built between 1910 and 1930. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Oxnard grew rapidly after the arrival of the Oxnard brother's 
American Beet Sugar Company in 1898, which was managed by Maj. J. A. Driffill. 
Homes were in great demand and the majority were constructed for the city's 
middle and upper-middle-class families, including many successful early 
businessmen, developers, and professional people. 
</P>
<P>
F Street, known as the Henry T. Oxnard subdivision, was developed in April 1909 
by the Oxnard Light and Water Company, whose president was Driffill. 
</P>
<P>
This particular house was built by Driffill as a wedding present for his 
daughter and her husband Charles J. Murphy, another prosperous Oxnard pioneer 
and partner of Murphy and Weill, the only grocery store in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
T. Frank McGrath bought the house in 1949. About 1956, following his death, 
Mrs. McGath moved into the spacious four-room guest house, giving the main 
residence to her daughter and family. 
</P>
<P>
The Fitzgibbons have owned the house for two and a half years. With only one 
child now living at home, the comfortable house and gardens are a perfect 
setting for visits from their other four children and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
According to design coordinator Noel Daily, designers have donated time, labor 
and most of the materials in decorating each room to conform to the color 
palette approved by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Each room is like a musical movement with the predominant color reflecting the 
room's function and creating a specific mood. The light mustard living room 
glows in contrast to the black marble fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Colors range from pale yellow, cornflower blue, and putty to coral, jade and 
bright Canton blue. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the furniture is upholstered in chintz fruit or floral patterns to 
bring the gardens indoors. Artists accented these shades by painting the crown 
moldings and wide baseboards white. The 9-foot ceilings are papered, painted, 
or bordered. The guest house, decorated in green and peach with white wooden 
shutters, is in cool contrast to the warm, brighter tones and tropical bird 
wall coverings of the main residence. 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds from the Design House benefit the Ventura County Symphony. Last 
year over 4,000 people toured the design home. The fund-raiser provided $30,000 
of the $45,000 raised by the Symphony League, including chapters in Camarillo, 
Ojai, Point Hueneme/Oxnard, and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Salazar, music director and conductor of the symphony, said "without the 
support of the League and the Board we would depend entirely upon ticket sales 
and that never pays all the bills." Salazar said the league is responsible for 
raising 10% of the annual symphony budget. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, formed in 1962, is now an ensemble of 80 professional musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Symphony League, with more than 500 volunteers, also 
provides cultural enrichment projects and educational outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Symphony Assn. and private contributions support the Civic/Youth Orchestra, 
whose players are students and non-professional adults. The Music in the 
Schools Ensemble Program consists of small ensembles that perform 
lecture/demonstrations for elementary school students. The Young Artist Award 
Competition provides scholarships and performance opportunities for talented 
young musicians, and Music-Go-Round, a van filled with instruments for hands-on 
workshops and demonstrations for children, is operated by docents through the 
League.

Earth Day celebrations all over are attracting some of the biggest names in 
entertainment, and Santa Barbara's is no different. Try the names Jackson 
Browne, Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina. Throw in some Hot Corn (bluegrass), 
Queen Mab (Celtic) and reggae, Andean, jazz and Mexican folk music, and you've 
got yourself a solid day's worth of activity. These acts will be at Santa 
Barbara City College from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday. In all, there will be 12 
musical acts, more than 120 informational booths, children's activities, art 
and photo booths, food and guest speakers, including state Sen. Gary K. Hart 
(D-Santa Barbara). No parking will be available on the campus, so organizers 
are urging people to take advantage of the free shuttle service. For more 
information on the shuttles, call 564-6849. For information about the event, 
call 564-6848. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival will enter its 18th season this summer. 
It's been featured on CBS' "Sunday Morning," on the BBC, on PBS and on NPR 
(just about all the big-time initials, in fact). 
</P>
<P>
It attracts the most talented up-and-coming and already established performers. 
And on Monday, six festival participants will perform at Campbell Hall on the 
UC Santa Barbara campus as part of their current tour. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians include violinist Ani Kavafian, who has performed with almost all of 
the nation's top orchestras, and cellist Carter Brey. Brey will be making his 
second visit to UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Timothy Eddy, who has toured the nation with the Marlboro Music 
Festival and has recorded with Columbia Records and several other companies, 
will perform, as will Paul Neubauer, who in 1984, at 21, became the principal 
violist for the New York Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
The concert starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $16, $14 and $12. Call (805)-961-3535. 
</P>
<P>
If you're tired of politely oohing and aahing over your child's drawings of 
stick-figure people standing next to tilted box-shaped houses, you may want to 
bring the little darling up to Santa Barbara sometime during the next two 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the city's Architectural Foundation is holding its second annual 
Kids Draw Architecture day, to give children the opportunity to sketch the 
County Courthouse, Mission Santa Barbara and de la Guerra Plaza under the 
watchful eyes of local architectural designers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to increase awareness that the buildings are out there and that they 
were actually designed" by someone, Program Director Tom Jacobs said. "When you 
draw the buildings, you see all the pieces of it and the care that went into 
it. They'll be learning about drawing, they'll be learning a little about the 
architecture profession and they'll be learning about Santa Barbara's 
heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Last year about 125 children participated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really amazing to see how children see things. Some were very precise and 
some had an individualistic style," he said. "You'd be surprised at what a 6- 
or 7-year-old can do. You don't think of a child going out and drawing a 
building, but they really get absorbed." 
</P>
<P>
There will be three sessions, all free: 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday at the County 
Courthouse, 1100 block of Anacapa Street; 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday at Mission Santa 
Barbara, Laguna and Los Olivos streets; and 1 to 3 p.m. April 29 at de la 
Guerra Plaza, de la Guerra Street. For more information call (805) 965-6307. 
</P>
<P>
And now for that age-old question . . . if you attended a blues concert and no 
blues artists showed up, would you hear the blues? 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry, it's purely hypothetical. Organizers of tonight's blues concert to 
benefit Santa Barbara's Special Olympics had a sticky problem but now 
everything is under control. A while back, they decided to have a blues 
concert. All they needed was a top-notch blues artist to show up. And they 
managed to find one, in guitarist Elvin Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop will headline the show at the Graduate in Isla Vista beginning at 7:30 
tonight. He'll be joined by two Santa Barbara acts, the Pontiax and Phil Cody, 
and by L.A.'s Jimmy Woods and the Immortals. Tickets are $18 at the door.

FILM STUDIOS' BIDDING WAR CREATING $1-MILLION SCRIPTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a mixture of horror, elation and awe, Hollywood has watched for the last 
three days as some of its biggest companies vied for, of all things, a film 
script. 
</P>
<P>
By several reports, 20th Century Fox began the bidding for 28-year-old writer 
Shane Black's new screenplay, "The Last Boy Scout," at $850,000 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Pictures quickly entered the fray but dropped out at just over $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. and a partnership between Tri-Star and Carolco Pictures joined the 
bidding for the script -- about a down-on-his-luck private eye who teams up 
with an ex-football star to solve a murder -- but so did the David Geffen Co., 
an independent producer that distributes through Warner. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday night, the price was up to $2 million, a bid posted by 
Carolco/Tri-Star, but Black said he preferred to make the film with 
Geffen/Warner, where he had worked before. So Geffen came up a winner at $1.75 
million -- an apparent record, and nearly double the $1-million-plus prices 
that have become almost routine in the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
Black, best known as creator of Warner's "Lethal Weapon," declined to discuss 
the sale, as did his agents, David Greenblatt and Bill Block of InterTalent. 
</P>
<P>
David Geffen, who produced "Beetlejuice," declined to discuss the price. But he 
said he bid for the script simply because "I can see a movie in it. It's not 
maybe a movie. It's definitely a movie, and those aren't easy to find." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the episode marks the latest round in a phenomenal bidding war 
that is boosting the fortunes of some screenwriters beyond what most dreamed 
possible when they staged a five-month strike just 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, Hollywood companies have fought an escalating battle for 
"spec scripts" -- screenplays written on speculation, often by inexperienced 
writers, without first having been commissioned by a producer or studio. 
</P>
<P>
The boom has been fed partly by a push to expand movie slates at Fox, Walt 
Disney Co.'s Hollywood Pictures unit and particularly at Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment, where Sony Corp.'s new managers have spent heavily on scripts 
since buying the studio last year. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at several studios claim to detest the bidding wars, which has 
pushed the price of scripts far beyond the $300,000 benchmark that was common 
barely a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"To get $1 million, it used to have to be a damned good script. Now, you 
practically pay that for the idea alone and wind up with a lot of rewrites. . . 
. It's completely out of hand," said David Hoberman, head of Disney's 
Touchstone unit, which has stayed out of the auctions. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate these auctions, I really do," said another executive who was among the 
bidders for Black's screenplay. Yet the same executive adds: "The market is 
giving writers some of the due that went to actors a couple of years ago, and 
to directors last year." 
</P>
<P>
Writers have clearly enjoyed some high points in the past. In 1967, for 
instance, William Goldman sold his "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" script 
for $400,000 -- an amount equal to roughly $1.6 million today, when adjusted 
for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Precise figures paid for screenplays aren't publicly available, but many 
industry executives believe that Black's sale far exceeded previous highs of 
just over $1 million. The screenplay apparently was especially attractive to 
studios because it is action-oriented, crafted well enough to attract a 
big-name director and actors, and commercial enough to promise the beginning of 
a "franchise" -- Hollywood terminology for a chain of money-making sequels. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the studios' hunger for spec scripts set in just as the 
"development" process -- the agonizing system by which executives pay writers 
to create and rewrite scripts based on ideas they have discussed in advance -- 
was becoming much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the vast bulk of movie scripts were sold under development 
deals, which guarantee seasoned writers payments that routinely exceed $200,000 
for a script but exact a heavy toll in terms of creative freedom. 
</P>
<P>
According to partially complete statistics from the Writers Guild of America 
West, roughly 83% of all Hollywood movie scripts were sold under development 
deals last year, down from 91% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the percentage of screenplays written in development deals eased 
downward, studio executives appeared to demand increasing control over the 
creative process -- a crackdown that some writers and agents attribute to the 
five-month writers strike in 1988, when studio executives had free time to 
review and tighten their development practices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much more worked out than it used to be," said Jim Kouf ("Disorganized 
Crime"), who writes and produces films under contract to Disney. "Now, they 
want to hear all about the three acts in a screenplay. They want to know 
exactly what they're buying." 
</P>
<P>
Several observers maintain that a more stringent development process has killed 
even the "pitch" -- an age-old ritual in which writers propose ideas to 
executives, who may take them or leave them. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching now seems outdated" for all but a handful of the most prestigious 
writers, such as Robert Towne ("Tequila Sunrise") or Joe Eszterhas ("Jagged 
Edge"), said one top writers' agent who declined to be identified. "Studios are 
self-generating their own projects, and then they 'audition' writers to see who 
can carry out their ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Chafing under such tight control and lured by growing money in the spec market, 
some seasoned professional writers say they are increasingly tempted to forgo 
the security of development deals in favor of the auction circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the same stories you do, and I say, 'Hey, shouldn't I be writing on 
spec?' " said Dan Petrie Jr., who is currently under contract to Disney and 
whose credits include "Beverly Hills Cop." 
</P>
<P>
Other seasoned writers privately complain that some of the biggest spec sales 
have gone to inexperienced writers who apparently hit the jackpot in the latest 
boom because they weren't tied to development contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's new co-chairmen, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, grabbed Hollywood 
attention with one such deal earlier this year when they agreed to pay a young 
writer, David Mickey Evans, more than $1 million to write and direct "Radio 
Flyer," which will be his first big studio film. 
</P>
<P>
Another newcomer, former William Morris agent Rick Jaffa, teamed up with a 
client, Doug Richardson, to write a World War II action comedy called "Hell 
Bent . . . And Back" -- and promptly garnered a reported $1-million fee from 
Hollywood Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the idea years ago, and I felt a time would come for it in the 
marketplace. I knew in my gut it would sell," said Jaffa, who declined to 
discuss the terms of his Disney deal. 
</P>
<P>
Still, others familiar with the screenplay say the writers and their William 
Morris agent were stunned when Disney's Hollywood unit "preempted" the 
screenplay by putting a $1-million offer on the table within 18 hours of seeing 
it, on the condition that the script be withheld from bidding by other 
production companies to which it had been promised. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Disney's frequent criticism of overspending by other companies, the 
studio's new Hollywood Pictures unit has also paid high prices for completed 
scripts by recent USC film school graduate Amanda Silver, who is Jaffa's wife, 
and others in a push to expand production quickly. Hollywood Pictures chief 
Ricardo Mestres declined to discuss the purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some film executives revel in the hunt-and-kill dynamic of a big auction, 
even while expressing dismay at rising prices. "I don't know of anything that 
generates the excitement of the chase after a big script," said John Goldwyn, 
executive vice president of worldwide production at MGM/UA Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
Script auctions occur suddenly, with little warning from agents, who try to 
hide their wares until the last minute -- partly because clients may be tempted 
by low offers if a potentially hot screenplay is leaked to buyers in advance. 
In recent months, executives say, auctions among as many as six or eight 
potential buyers have taken shape roughly once every 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Intrinsic merit may be enough to trigger bids. "It's that elusive hook. Who 
knows what it is, but you know it when you hear it," said Kouf, who sold 
"Disorganized Crime" as a spec script. 
</P>
<P>
Yet fancy legwork by agents from InterTalent, Morris, International Creative 
Management, Triad, Leading Artists and elsewhere appears to account for much of 
the interest that distinguishes a hot script from the three dozen or more 
screenplays that are circulated weekly by the leading agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The more aggressive agents usually place their best scripts with a small 
circuit of preferred studios or heavily bankrolled production companies, such 
as Carolco or Largo Entertainment, that are judged likely to engage in a 
bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
(Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's biggest talent agency, has been less 
inclined than rivals to fish for such bids on spec scripts, preferring instead 
to match much of its best material with directors or actors who are also 
represented by the agency, so that the script can be sold with other talent 
attached. "Philosophically, (they're) about getting movies made, not just the 
script sale," said one executive familiar with CAA.) 
</P>
<P>
Agents often try to generate heat around a script by withholding it from the 
studios and giving it instead to favored producers under contract to the big 
companies -- for instance, Joel Silver ("Lethal Weapon") at Warner Bros., or 
Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lansing ("Fatal Attraction") at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps things more personal. That's what studios pay all these producers for 
-- for their relationships," explained Lucas Foster, a development executive 
who recently left Scott Rudin Productions. 
</P>
<P>
The system allows agents to maintain a certain tension among rival producers on 
the same lot, all of whom are hungry for the best shot at material that, in 
most cases, will ultimately be funded from the studio coffers through the 
producers' contractual arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Some big purchases, particularly for lesser-known writers, may be triggered by 
one of several small networks of young development executives who protect each 
other against the worst sin -- simply not knowing about a supposedly hot script 
-- by sharing information and opinions about material despite their competitive 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We reciprocate. . . . Friends take care of each other," said one development 
executive, who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Heat, wherever it comes from, can disappear as quickly as it wells up in 
Hollywood. Some big bids, all based on telephone conversations, simply fail to 
materialize as second thoughts set in. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, screenplays that command big fees may be instantly "turned 
around" -- released for possible production by other companies -- because of 
management shifts. Thus, even the material purchased recently at Columbia is 
under review by new executives who were brought in by Guber and Peters to fill 
the top film jobs at the Tri-Star and Columbia units. 
</P>
<P>
The real question, said John Watson, who recently co-wrote a Robin Hood story 
called "Prince of Thieves" with Pen Densham and sold it to Morgan Creek for $1 
million, is: "How many of these things we've paid so much money for do we 
actually make?"

LOW-POWER TELEVISION SERVES THOSE BEYOND THE REACH OF EITHER CABLE OR 
CONVENTIONAL BROADCASTERS. BUT FEW STATIONS HAVE FULFILLED POPULIST GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In small Indian communities from the Rockies to the desert Southwest, low-cost 
television "mini-stations" are broadcasting political debates, giving native 
language instruction and airing documentaries on Indian art and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside of Disney World in Florida, a similar station beams a steady diet 
of commercials for local tourist attractions along the main strip of hotels and 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
And in the Bronx, in neighborhoods so poor cable operators are afraid their 
copper wires will be stripped by scavengers, at least 300,000 Haitians tune in 
to a station broadcasting in the patois that most islanders speak. 
</P>
<P>
This is low-power television -- "LPTV" for short. Transmitting signals over the 
air to areas within a radius of 15 to 30 miles, using as little as 10 watts or 
as much as 1,000 watts -- compared to the hundreds of thousands of watts 
generated by most TV transmitters, these stations serve television's 
disfranchised: viewers geographically and linguistically beyond the reach of 
conventional broadcasting and financially out of reach of cable or satellite 
dishes. And while Lilliputian in size, LPTVs put out signals that can be 
received without any special equipment or fee. For broadcasters, the benefit is 
also the cost. LPTVs can be put on the air for as little as $80,000, although 
there is ample opportunity to lose that much and more. 
</P>
<P>
The concept emerged out of the counterculture in the early 1970s, when 
technically oriented young people began to use cheap new technologies in rural 
areas that, for topographical reasons, couldn't receive traditional television 
signals. One place this happened was in Lanesville, N.Y., in a small valley 
near Woodstock. A group of people who called themselves the Video-freex set up 
a low-power station, without troubling the Federal Communications Commission 
for a license. 
</P>
<P>
"We began going around town, kind of making tapes," recalled Paul McIssac. 
Coverage included fires and car accidents, lost dogs, bar fights, weddings and 
baseball games. "They had a wonderful sense of humor and localness." 
</P>
<P>
These populist pioneers, using the slogan "low power to the people," managed to 
convince the FCC that, in addition to serving rural people "off the net" of 
existing television broadcasting, low-power technology could aim for the 
fringe, providing programming diversity and encouraging minority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades later, only a few stations have fulfilled that promise. 
</P>
<P>
At schools like Dull Knife Memorial College in Lame Deer, Mont., and Navajo 
Community College in Tsaile, Ariz., student interns and volunteers learn how to 
operate cameras and cut videotape on LPTVs, thanks to grants from the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. In addition to sharing oral histories of tribal elders, 
the stations also connect viewers on the reservation with the Global Village, 
beaming "Sesame Street" from satellites to Mescalero Apaches in remote, 
mountainous areas of New Mexico and to the Blackfeet in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Low power "works real well for rural areas," said Matthew Jones, project 
coordinator for the Native American Public Broadcasting Consortium in Lincoln, 
Neb. "It gives them an option to do local programming. It's doing for rural 
areas what the access channel is doing for cable in the cities. It gives them a 
voice for promoting cultural awareness." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Alaska, 250 public, low-power stations built and operated by the 
state bring a single channel -- combining programming from the one public and 
three commercial networks, along with "interactive" educational programs -- to 
communities. These settlements are so remote that they have no other access to 
television, apart from costly satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
"For a relatively small number of people, it's a godsend," said Andrew 
Schwartzman of the Washington-based Media Access Project, a public interest 
watchdog organization. 
</P>
<P>
A Buffalo, N.Y., station owned by Ralph Nader's Citizens Television System -- a 
funky, shoestring operation -- also coincides with low power's early ideals. 
Channel 58 is overseen by longtime Nader associate Sam Simon, who notes that 
nearly half the viewing households in the country are not plugged in to cable. 
</P>
<P>
The station operates from space provided by a local college and is funded 
partly by grants and partly by revenues from ads taken out by local pizza shops 
and pet stores. Simon calls his LPTV, which features school board meetings, 
ballet performances, documentaries, City Council meetings and community 
festivals, "the functional equivalent of local C-SPAN. . . . The idea is, we're 
there, we'll cover it for you." Various groups can come in and do their own 
programming on Channel 58, but the station maintains editorial control. 
</P>
<P>
"By using this vehicle to let the community speak with itself, share ideas with 
itself, share the experience," Simon said, "it strengthens the community, as 
opposed to delivery of somebody else's ideas of programming." 
</P>
<P>
There are now approximately 800 LPTVs on the air in the nation, with an average 
viewership of 14,500. In the past year alone, said Keith Larsen, head of the 
LPTV section of the FCC, the government has licensed about 200 new stations in 
the continental 48 states, a 73% increase over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even as the number of stations grows, the idealistic founders of 
the movement believe that their vision may have fallen victim to commercial 
forces and religious broadcasters who simply want to extend the shopping and 
promotional reach of programming that already is mushrooming on cable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jury Still Out 
</P>
<P>
There is little original or locally produced programming on most commercial 
LPTVs. Despite reduced start-up costs, less government regulation and the large 
number of the estimated 4,500 new licenses available, the industry says 
minority ownership of privately operated LPTVs is less than 10% -- which still 
dwarfs minority ownership of other TV media. 
</P>
<P>
Growth also has been spotty. Many stations prove unprofitable and go under. 
Says the FCC's Larsen: "I think low power right now is beginning to get its 
fair test in the marketplace, and I think the jury is out." 
</P>
<P>
The industry's focus is rapidly shifting to stations like the Tourist Channel 
in Kissimmee, Fla., which borders on major Orlando-area attractions. The 
year-old, almost totally computerized station is located in a suite of offices 
in a bank plaza, broadcasting from its roof to the main strip of hotels and 
motels near Disney World and Sea World. Programming consists of 24 hours a day 
of commercials, weather reports, schedules, prices and "infomercial segments." 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to do one thing," said general manager Nick Ashton, "make profit 
and have fun. . . . We've taken little tourist magazines and papers and turned 
them into an electronic medium." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Ownership 
</P>
<P>
Group owners, like the one that owns Ashton's station, now control about half 
of the existing LPTVs in the lower 48 states. Religious broadcasters like 
Orange County-based Trinity Broadcasting Network and the Home Shopping Network, 
taking advantage of the absence of FCC ownership limits, are snapping up 
stations. Full-power television stations are using LPTVs as inexpensive 
transmission towers or as satellite stations to extend their reach. 
</P>
<P>
In California, says the Community Broadcasters Assn., the low-power trade 
association, there are 37 LPTVs on the air. Although numerous licenses have 
been granted, there are no low-power television stations now operating in 
Southern California, for a variety of reasons including market saturation, 
topography and legal wrangles. However, Cal State Northridge has been granted a 
license and is now advertising for "a potential business partner" to operate an 
LPTV station "that will serve the affluent, 300,000 L.A. suburb of the western 
San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Also active in buying stations and lining up affiliates are programming 
services that feature dog racing, game shows, old movies and inexpensive 
reruns. These organizations, now serving more than 80% of the nation's LPTVs, 
have been able to negotiate their way onto cable systems owned by multiple 
system operators. Channel America, for example also makes use of an 
"interactive" relationship with game show viewers, either with telephones or 
remote control switches. In Florida, if you watch Video Jukebox Network you can 
call a 976 number and, for $2, order up a music video. Other companies hope to 
utilize similar technology to sell cars and real estate and link up to 
off-track betting. 
</P>
<P>
The financial outlook for the industry remains uncertain, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Bishop Cheen, a senior analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel-based 
media-consulting firm, calls low power the "slowest growing land rush the media 
has ever seen," citing early delays and bureaucratic bottlenecks at the FCC. 
The industry's future is still problematic, he said, with results "all over the 
map." 
</P>
<P>
The real key, Cheen said, is getting on a cable system. "Cable is a great 
equalizer. Mass delivery is what counts. . . . If innovative LPTV works with 
cable, then the sky's the limit. If it doesn't, the survival rate is not going 
to be impressive. " 
</P>
<P>
In Worland, Wyo., an LPTV folded after the local cable system operated by 
Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest owner of cable 
systems, refused to carry the signal. John C. Malone, TCI's chairman, calls 
LPTV "a very special case," although TCI has carried LPTVs on systems in New 
York and Pennsylvania. There is no companywide policy against carrying 
low-power stations, Malone said, adding that the Nader affiliate in Buffalo is 
"a pretty good thing, and we've agreed to carry it." 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials acknowledge that there may be no more than two dozen such 
LPTVs operating in the black. And frequently these are in so-called "white 
areas," rural or urban areas that for one reason or another are not adequately 
served by full power stations or by cable. However, these same areas may be 
reached in the future -- perhaps as early as 1992 -- by "direct broadcast 
satellites" and received with inexpensive, window pane-sized receivers, a 
system unveiled in February by four major telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-ownership and capitalization are other factors: Single-owner LPTVs seem 
to have a greater chance of survival when they also own a local newspaper, 
radio station, video store, electronic equipment company or are married to 
someone in a deep pockets profession. 
</P>
<P>
Community Identity 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best known independent LPTV outlet is Channel 43 in Hopkinsville, 
Ky., which has been broadcasting near the Tennessee and Indiana borders for the 
past five years. Before that time, said D.J. Everett, the station manager, "the 
only significant television that the people in our area have been able to get 
has been either Tennessee television or Indiana television. Well, you know 
there's just a normal thing that people do, they identify with their own town 
and their own state." 
</P>
<P>
Everett's LPTV, which is owned by the prosperous local newspaper, tried various 
formats and types of programming before finding a formula that worked. While 
old movies and sitcoms fill much of the daytime schedule, it is the evening and 
weekend fare that gives the station its identity and pays the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"We're strictly in the news and sports business," said Everett. "That's what 
the people in our community want. That's what we offer that nobody else offers, 
so they have a very strong reason to watch us. . . . You've got a station there 
in Los Angeles that's (doing) prime time news, which we did over two years 
ago." The emphasis on local news and sports is what got Channel 43 on area 
cable systems, Everett said, and what keeps him there. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 15 cable systems that I'm on, the only true local voice on those cable 
systems would be gone if they took me off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bogner, an electronic equipment manufacturer, has had less success with 
the low-power stations he operates in the New York metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
Bogner said he has been "doing reasonably well" with his inner-city stations, 
selling time to various ethnic groups, adding: "I could be happier. . . . I 
haven't gotten a handle on how secure my business is." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates that at least 300,000 Haitians watch one of his stations, "because 
we're the only station that broadcasts in the patois" that most islanders 
speak. "With an ethnic audience, they sometimes are willing to watch a marginal 
color picture in their language, rather than a great picture on CBS if they 
don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Other models for small-time entrepreneurs are for "boutique" stations, catering 
to upscale clientele in resort areas. In Park City, Utah, and Killington, Vt., 
LPTVs broadcast ski reports, ski championships and ski movies. And in Twin 
Falls, Ida., a low-power station regularly broadcasts baseball games of the 
Seattle Mariners, who own the local minor league franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Couzens, a former FCC attorney who was one of the architects of low 
power, says that while the industry hasn't fulfilled all of the goals he and 
others had for the medium, he is not disappointed. There are now 500 more 
television stations on the air than there were before. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a step toward a more competitive television environment," said 
Couzens, now an industry consultant and journalist. "It's not complete, but I'm 
glad it was done. It did its little part." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Kissimmee, that little part consists of Nick Ashton directing the 
action in the Tourist Channel's tiny studio, where the marketing director for 
nearby Gatorland is on her hands and knees, piecing graphics together on the 
carpet for a camera for another 30-second spot. 
</P>
<P>
But even on an LPTV as single-mindedly devoted to profits as this one, the pull 
of community service is strong. In the past month, Ashton has added brief 
newscasts from Reuters, an 800-telephone number for tourist problems and three 
minutes per hour of Spanish language information and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing these things as a marketing ploy -- to get people to watch our 
station," Ashton explains. "What low power is designed for is to serve the 
community, and what we have here is a tourism community. . . . We can help them 
and keep them informed." 
</P>

Photo, Tuning In: Low-power, low-cost television -- LPTV for short -- has 
traditionally served those beyond the geographic or linguistic reach of cable 
or conventional broadcasters. Now, as Column One explains, the industry's focus 
is starting to change. Stations such as the Tourist Channel in Florida 
broadcast 24 hours a day of commercials, weather reports, schedules, prices and 
"infomercial segments." Says general manager Nick Ashton, left: "We've taken 
little tourist magazines and papers and turned them into an electronic medium."

QUAKES AREN'T TIED TOGETHER, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The earthquakes that rattled both Northern and Southern California on 
consecutive days this week even startled a few scientists, although they 
insisted there is no reason to believe that the widely separated earthquakes 
were related events. 
</P>
<P>
"We're uneasy when we see earthquakes popping off all over the place," said 
William Ellsworth, a seismologist and geophysicist with the U.S. Geological 
Survey in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly added that he doesn't think that Tuesday's quakes near Upland 
caused Wednesday's quakes near Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a mechanism (that would cause that), we don't understand it," 
Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech staff seismologist Kate Hutton was a little more succinct. Asked if 
earthquakes can cause other temblors hundreds of miles away, she said bluntly: 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
The question pops up every time earthquakes strike at about the same time at 
widely separated locations, partly because "we tend to see patterns in 
everything," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been enough quakes in California this week to jangle even the 
strongest of nerves. At least 14 quakes, ranging up to 5.3, hit the area 
between Watsonville and Santa Cruz Wednesday morning on the heels of a series 
of quakes near Upland on Tuesday measuring up to 4.6. The Southern California 
desert community of Indio also had two small quakes Wednesday morning measuring 
3.2 and 3.8. 
</P>
<P>
When an earthquake strikes, it rearranges stress patterns in the Earth's upper 
crust that can cause aftershocks or even other quakes nearby, but "changes (in 
stress) even several miles away are minuscule," Hutton said. So she sees no way 
that quakes at one end of the state can cause temblors at the other. 
</P>
<P>
However, adjacent areas are another matter entirely, and experts were examining 
evidence Wednesday that the Watsonville temblors may indeed have been caused by 
the devastating Loma Prieta quake that struck Oct. 17. The Loma Prieta quake 
caused extensive damage as far away as San Francisco, and Ellsworth said that 
Wednesday's temblors seem to have extended the October rupture southward on the 
San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Wednesday's earthquakes could offer scientists a classic study in how 
some temblors can cause other nearby quakes by redistributing stress patterns 
in the Earth's crust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a jigsaw puzzle," Ellsworth said. "And we just had a whole bunch of 
new pieces dumped into the puzzle all at once." 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes are caused by the movement of the huge slabs of the Earth's crust, 
called tectonic plates. The giant plates literally float on the Earth's molten 
mantle, grinding past each other as they move about the surface of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Plate, which underlies nearly the entire Pacific Ocean, and the 
North American Plate, which includes nearly the entire continent, grind past 
each other along the West Coast. One of the most prominent manifestations of 
that process is the San Andreas Fault that rips through the length of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the San Andreas moves almost continuously in a process that 
allows the plates to pass each other gradually with minimal problems. But in 
most areas, the fault sticks like two pieces of sandpaper being rubbed 
together. Occasionally, the pieces slip, releasing enormous amounts of energy 
through an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The interaction of various blocks of the Earth's crust can be extremely 
complex, so at this point scientists are struggling to understand the dynamics 
of what now appears to be a series of Northern California quakes that began 
with the Oct. 17 temblor that killed 67 people. 
</P>
<P>
The October quake hit in the mountains between Santa Cruz and San Jose, and it 
struck along a section of the San Andreas that has been seismically "quiet" for 
some time, Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the two plates suddenly slipped in what scientists call the "Loma 
Prieta quake" last October, it redistributed stress patterns in nearby blocks 
of the Earth's crust, and scientists have been trying ever since to find out 
just how the patterns have changed. 
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the evidence is "preliminary," Ellsworth believes they 
found out Wednesday just where the stress moved to. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently moved south to the next section of the San Andreas, which has 
been relatively active over the years. Wednesday's activity was "much more 
vigorous than we have seen in the past," Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
The quakes ranged up to 5.3 in magnitude, and they may not ultimately be 
classified as aftershocks to the October temblor because they struck on a 
different segment of the fault. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quakes, like all temblors, also changed stress patterns in that 
area, but it will be months before scientists figure out which areas are the 
most likely candidates for quakes in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
But most experts would agree on at least one point: Wednesday's quakes in 
Northern California have nothing to do with the temblors that shook much of 
Southern California in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too far away," said Caltech's Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECENT QUAKE ACTIVITY 
</P>
<P>
While scientists found the succession of earthquakes this week in Northern and 
Southern California intriguing, they insist they are not related. Tuesday's 
quakes that hit the Upland area did not cause Wednesday's quakes near 
Watsonville because the distance between the two areas is just too great, they 
say. "When an earthquake happens, it releases strain in the immediate area," 
said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton, and that can cause aftershocks nearby. 
But areas that are farther away are subject to very different geophysical 
conditions, and one quake is unlikely to cause another temblor even 20 or 30 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Watsonville 
</P>
<P>
A swarm of earthquakes struck the Bay Area beginning at 6:37 Wednesday morning. 
The largest of the temblors was a magnitude 5.3 quake, with at least 13 others 
registering 1.6 or more by nightfall. Seismologists said Wednesday's quakes 
resulted from stress patterns created by the 7.1 magnitude Bay Area quake that 
killed 67 last October and caused damage estimated at more than $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Upland 
</P>
<P>
A daylong series of quakes jolted the Upland area on Tuesday. The quakes, all 
aftershocks of a 5.5-magnitude temblor on Feb. 28, measured between 4.6 and 2.6 
on the magnitude scale. 
</P>
<P>
Indio 
</P>
<P>
Two quakes struck the Indio area at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. One measured 3.8 
on the magnitude scale, the other 3.2. Seismologists said both were aftershocks 
of a 4.1 quake there earlier this month.

VAN DE KAMP AND FEINSTEIN AGREE TO TWO TV DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John K. Van de Kamp and Dianne Feinstein agreed to debate on live, prime-time 
television twice next month -- staking the outcome of a long and closely 
matched Democratic primary race for governor on 120 minutes of daredevil 
political TV. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced by the two campaigns Wednesday, runs contrary to the 
modern trend in California politics, in which televised debates are avoided as 
too venturesome, too hard to control and too apt to be decisive in a close 
contest. Political researchers said they could find no contemporary precedent 
for such televised, pre-primay debates among the major contenders in a 
California governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
But self-confidence and the lack of a breakaway front-runner -- and, maybe, a 
dash of hard-headedness -- apparently provided the right chemistry to enliven 
this mostly lackluster contest between Feinstein, the 56-year-old former mayor 
of San Francisco, and Van de Kamp, the 54-year-old state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a fair and interesting debate," the two candidates said in 
joint letters of acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Their agreement calls for a Sunday, May 13, encounter on KPIX-TV in San 
Francisco to be offered for simulcast on KRON-TV, also in San Francisco. It is 
unclear whether it will be offered to stations outside the Bay Area. The second 
debate will be Monday, May 21, at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, sponsored by the 
League of Women Voters, with simultaneous feeds to stations in other cities. 
Each debate is to be an hour long, in the familiar format which has the 
candidates questioned by a panel of hand-picked journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to the candidates said they had been assured by the stations that the 
debates will occur in prime time. No restrictions were placed on subject 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Political professionals were quick to suggest that the two debates in this 
particular race may be of profound importance. Some of their reasons why: 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have swapped leads in public opinion polls and taken turns 
riding the momentum of the moment, but neither has shown a sure-footed ability 
to run in front. The timing of the appearances puts the two in view of 
Californians just as large numbers of voters find their interest awakening in 
the race. Neither contender seems able to raise commanding sums of money that 
could dominate the advertising airwaves. And, frankly, neither candidate has 
developed stirring themes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no sense of who they really are as people. . . . These debates will 
allow people to assess -- without a filter -- just who these candidates are and 
who they like. And like is going to be real important in this election," said 
Barbara O'Connor of the Institute for the Study of Media and Politics at 
Sacramento State University. "Neither of the candidates is very likable as they 
have been packaged so far." 
</P>
<P>
O'Conner, the League of Women Voters and other experts said there is no record 
of a televised pre-primary campaign debate on live television among the major 
candidates for governor. In the past, there have been so-called "joint forums" 
among candidates of the same party, but nothing on the order of an event that 
could reach millions, live, in a single hour. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic political consultant Kam Kuwata, who is affiliated with neither 
campaign, said: "It will be a major defining event of this campaign. With the 
candidates there side by side, voters have a chance to comparison shop." 
</P>
<P>
Debates tend to take surprising turns and end up hinging on one single moment 
or a memorable line, making it risky to guess what is ahead. But observers 
following this campaign closely agree that the two candidates come to the 
studio stage with different strengths and potential weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein is mediagenic and has a knack for presenting herself as both emphatic 
and sincere. She has stumbled on occasion, however, when it came to knowledge 
of state government. Van de Kamp, on the other hand, is extremely conversant 
about state government. But the camera is not nearly as friendly to him, and he 
tends to sound too lawyerly. 
</P>
<P>
Back in February, Feinstein had proposed six debates, and Van de Kamp accepted. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Van de Kamp expressed some bitterness that the campaigns were 
able to agree only on two. During staff-level negotiations, he said, both 
campaigns first agreed on a compromise four debates -- two on television, one 
without cameras for print reporters and one with radio journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been informed that Dianne Feinstein is now unwilling to participate in 
even this scaled-down version of her challenge. That is regretable," said Van 
de Kamp in a cover letter released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein aides said Van de Kamp dallied in getting his side to the negotiating 
table, leaving not enough time for more than two debates.

KIDNAPED BOY RELEASED AFTER HELPING WITH NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>

An 8-year-old boy who was grabbed from a Placentia school playground and held 
hostage by a woman with a gun Wednesday calmly negotiated his own release 
before police took the woman into custody, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy was pretty cool throughout the whole ordeal," Placentia Police Lt. 
Daryll Thomann said. "He was the negotiator." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 12:15 p.m. when a woman, identified as Sheila Faye 
Reed, 30, of Yorba Linda, allegedly walked on to the Van Buren Elementary 
School playground and grabbed the boy, who was playing ball with another 
student, Thomann said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed apparently dragged the 4th-grader to a bench at Carlsbad Park, adjacent to 
the school, Thomann said. A school teacher saw the boy being kidnaped and 
called police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman did not know the boy. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they found the suspect sitting on the park bench with the 
boy and pointing a .22 caliber semi-automatic handgun at the child's head. "She 
threatened to shoot him," Thomann said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect communicated with police through the boy, having him yell 
information to the officers instead of talking to them directly. 
</P>
<P>
After about 20 minutes of negotiations, the suspect agreed to release the boy 
if a nearby officer gave his shotgun to her, Thomann said. 
</P>
<P>
"We said we couldn't do that," the lieutenant said. "That's when the boy 
suggested (on his own) that the officer drop the shotgun where he was standing 
and walk away." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect agreed to the suggestion and the officer dropped the gun, he said. 
At that point, the suspect freed the boy, who ran and jumped into the arms of 
an officer. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later police talked the suspect into throwing down her weapon, 
Thomann said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and taken to Orange County Jail.

GORDON EMERGES AS SCYPHERS' LATEST POWER HITTER AT SIMI VALLEY HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Sharts gazes skyward. He could be watching a baseball fly far over an 
outfield fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Gordon," he says slowly, as if speaking of a legendary slugger. Sharts 
squeezes a bat and taps it to the ground. "Joe . . . Gordon." 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, a 6-foot-6, 222-pound first baseman, is not easily impressed. He was 
perhaps the best power hitter in Southern Section history when he played at 
Simi Valley High from 1986-88. He holds the career home run record at 32 and 
missed the single-season standard by one when he hit 15 his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts still lives in Simi Valley and still bashes home runs: He leads Cal 
State Northridge with 17 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon happens to be a 5-11, 160-pound senior infielder for Simi Valley High 
who never hit a home run in high school before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Great Scott and Average Joe. 
</P>
<P>
What could Sharts possibly admire in Gordon? 
</P>
<P>
Could be his hot home run trot. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon has 11 home runs, including one Wednesday in a 6-4 win over Royal. He 
has five regular-season games and possible playoff games to reach Sharts' 
single-season school record of 15. 
</P>
<P>
"If he breaks the record, that's the way it is," Sharts said, shrugging. "It 
can't stand forever. Joe is a good contact hitter. I've known him for a while. 
He's always willing to take extra hacks." 
</P>
<P>
When he's not in a batting cage or taking live hitting, Gordon is swinging away 
at a solo hitting device that his father markets. "My life is my swing," 
proclaimed Gordon, who is called "Flash" by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Sharts isn't surprised at Gordon's electrifying power surge for two 
additional reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, a right-handed batter, plays at the homer-friendly Simi Valley field, 
which measures 295 feet down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon plays for Coach Mike Scyphers, who at 5-9, 150 pounds is the Southern 
Section's unlikely bard of going yard. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people talk about hitting, but Coach Scyphers talks about the right 
things," Gordon said. "And not just about hitting, but inspiring a winning 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Home runs, of course, go a long way toward victory. 
</P>
<P>
At most schools, a burly player with obvious power occasionally comes along. At 
Simi Valley, average-sized players hit with great power every year. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon is merely the latest in a long succession of Scyphers-trained Teen-Age 
Mutant Ninja Sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over in 1979, Scyphers has a lifetime record of 230-78 but has not 
calculated his home-field record. His teams have racked up 277 home runs, 
including an impressive 176 in 160 games over the past 5 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching problems this season will prevent Simi Valley (10-8, 4-3 in Marmonte 
League play) from posting at least 20 victories for the sixth year in a row. As 
usual, however, the Pioneers lead the league in home runs (25) and average a 
league-leading 7.4 runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Scyphers is a hell of a coach," Sharts said. "He's a little guy but he knows a 
lot about hitting. He's especially helpful with the mental aspect. He taught me 
how to be a smart hitter, what pitch to look for in what zone on what count. 
</P>
<P>
"I still talk with him all the time, just about after every game." 
</P>
<P>
Scyphers does a lot of talking during games as well, constantly reminding his 
team that it is one swing away from breaking a game open or overcoming a 
deficit. Especially when the Pioneers are playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
"No lead is safe at this field. We understand that and never get down," 
Scyphers said. "A three-run home run by the other team doesn't bother us at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Frequently flustered are opposing batters, however. Those playing at Simi 
Valley for the first time react similarly. 
</P>
<P>
"They walk onto the field, take one look at the fence and begin licking their 
chops," Scyphers said. "Hitters try to pull every pitch, so we work with our 
pitchers to keep the ball down and away. Subsequently, we get a lot of ground 
balls to shortstop and third." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks junior David Skeels, a .500 hitter who blasted his first career 
home run at Simi Valley last month, agreed that the close fence is a temptation 
he'd rather do without: "You show up, see the short porch and everybody is 
saying that anybody can hit it out of there. Then you overswing." 
</P>
<P>
After watching Simi Valley from the opposing dugout for eight years as coach at 
league rival Camarillo, Ken Wagner is working with former Pioneers as Moorpark 
College coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike prepares his kids very well," he said. "They hit a lot of home runs and 
people say it's the field, but I don't remember too many barely making it out 
of the park. They've had some very good baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think opposing kids can get psyched on their field." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, home is where the homers are for Simi Valley batters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our field is smaller so it gives me confidence that if I hit it to left, it 
has more of a chance to get out," said Gordon, who has hit all but one of his 
home runs at home. And while acknowledging that all of his home runs have been 
hit to left field, he insisted, "I think about going to right field. It makes 
me patient." 
</P>
<P>
All things come to those who wait for a pitch they can drive, preaches 
Scyphers. He believes that a fat pitch can be found nearly every at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, after each player has taken his daily 100 swings against live 
pitching or in a cage behind the field ("Repetition is key," Scyphers said), 
the coach stands in front of the mound and pitches while each player takes a 
simulated at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime during the at-bat, I give them one nice, medium-speed pitch they 
should drive," he said. "They really learn to lay off until they get their best 
pitch. If they miss that pitch or take it, I make it tough on them." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen to 20 times in the past decade, by Scyphers' estimation, Simi Valley 
won a home game after the fifth inning with a home run. Never, he claims, has a 
Simi Valley opponent done the same. 
</P>
<P>
Most memorable is a first-round playoff game in 1981 against Mira Costa. Simi 
Valley trailed, 9-4, in the seventh inning and Tim Rapp hit a two-run home run 
with one out to pull the Pioneers to within three. With two out, the bases were 
loaded for Bobby Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him not to be overanxious, to wait on a good pitch," Scyphers recalled. 
"So he drives the first pitch over the left-field fence and we win." 
</P>
<P>
Another unforgettable comeback came in 1988 with the Pioneers trailing Newbury 
Park, 5-0, in the seventh. Sophomore Jeff Sommer (now a senior with 15 career 
homers) opened the inning with a home run. The bases were loaded with none out 
and Darren Aurand hit a grand slam to tie the score. Sharts followed with a 
game-winning shot on a 3-0 count. 
</P>
<P>
On his personal list of long-term, long-ball memories, Sharts adds 
seventh-inning blasts that defeated Canoga Park two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Those game-winners were especially sweet for Scyphers, a Canoga Park alumnus. 
As a diminutive high school junior, he was sometimes asked to bat leadoff and 
take two strikes, at which point he would be replaced by a pinch-hitter. 
Scyphers is quick to point out that, for the record, he did hit one home run as 
a senior. "And we used wooden bats in those days," he added. 
</P>
<P>
These days, he has a blast along with his players. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Scyphers had home run contests in practice. That was fun," Sharts 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
An uneven matchup, it would seem, but don't forget that Gordon, who stands just 
a tad taller than his coach, is chasing Sharts' record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something to shoot for," said Gordon, who added, almost apologetically, 
"but I'm not a home run hitter." 
</P>
<P>
He could have fooled opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"That little Gordon kid has a sweet stroke," said Don Cardinal, the Channel 
Islands coach. "He doesn't seem like he tries to overpower the ball." 
</P>
<P>
But like so many Simi Valley players over the years, he does anyway.

A WHOLESOME MAJESTY;

<P>
COLLEGE SOPHOMORE SAYS HER VALUES JIBE WITH HER REIGN AS FESTIVAL QUEEN

The reigning monarch flipped straight to the dessert section of the menu. "I 
know this is going to sound silly, but I've had a craving for something with 
strawberries in it all day," said Valerie Greenhorn, winner of last year's 
Oxnard Strawberry Festival's strawberry blond contest. 
</P>
<P>
Ordering a strawberry shake, wearing a strawberry pin on her dress and pushing 
her strawberry blond hair away from her face, Greenhorn had the appearance of a 
true strawberry queen, but she is not one to put on airs. "Beauty contestants 
are stereotyped as being prissy and conceited," she said. "But most of the ones 
I know are nice, normal people." In fact, Greenhorn works part time in the 
Ortega eatery at UC Santa Barbara and performs a variety of plebeian tasks such 
as cooking and cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
A sophomore at UCSB, Greenhorn, 19, has competed in several pageants and she 
remembers the strawberry blond contest as the most fun. "It's not the 
full-force competition you find in pageants," she said. "It's not so much about 
appearance or perfection. There's no swimsuit segment or an evening dress 
competition. It's more about just who you are, your personality." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a dress that came down well below her knees and buttoned at her neck 
and wrists, Greenhorn said she's very modest. "I know that sounds strange 
coming from a girl who parades on stage in front of judges while wearing 
nothing but a bathing suit," she said. "It's hard to explain why that doesn't 
bother me. But, for instance, I wear a bikini on the beach. And that's OK 
because it belongs there. And wearing a swimsuit for a pageant is OK because it 
belongs there too." 
</P>
<P>
The bathing suit competition is included in most pageants because, Greenhorn 
said, the contestants are judged on their overall image. "Personality and poise 
are the most important," she said. "But a girl has to care enough about herself 
to stay in shape. And appearing in a bathing suit is really the best way for 
the judges to see if a contestant has muscle definition or if she's a couch 
potato." 
</P>
<P>
Greenhorn acknowledged that some people think beauty contests exploit women 
because, as they see it, women are compared and judged on their beauty and 
figures, therefore implying that these are their most important attributes. 
"First of all, beauty is not the most important thing in the contests," 
Greenhorn said. "But yes, that is a part of it. The judges are looking for an 
all-round representative, someone who is poised, talented and nice-looking. So 
if a girl is extremely talented or academic or whatever, a pageant may not be 
the best thing for her. But for girls who might or might not be outstanding at 
any one thing, but are balanced, then this might be the place where they can 
really show themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Greenhorn considers herself an advocate of feminist concepts because she 
believes women shouldn't face job discrimination and that they should get equal 
pay for equal work. But she also believes there are certain differences between 
men and women. 
</P>
<P>
"And pageants give women a chance to show off the feminine side. We can show 
our prim and proper, our young lady side, which we don't have a chance to do 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
Greenhorn, who plays the piano, flute and tenor saxophone, plans to graduate as 
a music major and then get married and raise a family. "I want to have three 
children," she said. "That always seemed like a good number. And I want at 
least one little girl so I can dress her up in little dresses and little socks 
and little bows. But if once she got older she decided she'd rather dress like 
a tomboy, I'd let her. I'd be heartbroken, but I'd let her." 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a military employee, Greenhorn was born in Okinawa, Japan, and 
spent most of her early years in Guam. It was there that she first started 
attending church. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic values were instilled in me at that time." she said. "My parents 
aren't Christian, but I accepted Christ when I was only 8. Actually, I was too 
young then to know what it was all about. But now Christ is the center of my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in sex before marriage. I don't believe in drugs or excessive 
alcohol. And I don't swear. I also refuse to go to a party where there will be 
drugs. But I will go to a party where there's alcohol. If I avoided everyone 
who did things that I don't do, then I wouldn't have any friends." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Greenhorn said that as a Christian she feels she must set an 
example. "I feel I have an image to uphold so I can't let loose," she said. 
"But that's OK. I enjoy working toward a goal and having the stability and 
self-control to be the kind of person I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Her beliefs usually aren't a factor in pageants, she said. But it may have been 
an advantage for the strawberry blond contest. "After all, I'm representing 
Oxnard's strawberry industry. They're looking for someone with a pure and 
wholesome image," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

15 KILLED WHEN GRENADE HITS BEIRUT SCHOOL BUS

A rifle-fired grenade slammed into a school bus and exploded during Christian 
factional fighting Wednesday, killing 11 schoolchildren and at least four other 
people. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the bus was hit while crossing into mostly Christian 
East Beirut in the afternoon. It was bringing children back from school in 
southern Beirut. The grenade ignited the fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't be determined who fired the rifle grenade," said the spokesman, 
who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
A radio station run by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, the Lebanese army commander, 
accused gunmen of Samir Geagea's rival Lebanese Forces militia of firing at the 
bus. However, Geagea's command denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun and Geagea have been involved in a bloody power struggle for control of 
Lebanon's 310-square-mile Christian enclave for more than two months. The 
showdown has killed hundreds of people, mostly civilians. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the pupils yelled for help as we tried to extinguish the fire. At 
least one teacher also was among the dead, along with the driver," said a 
soldier at the scene where the bus was hit 
</P>
<P>
"I survived by a miracle," a 30-year-old teacher identified only as Teresa told 
reporters at Sacre Coeur Hospital, where many victims were taken. "A roaring 
fire suddenly erupted and quickly spread aboard the bus. I slipped through a 
window near my seat." 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the bus belonged to the Mraijeh Elementary School, a 
new private school in southern Beirut. It was not immediately clear why 
students from East Beirut were attending school in the southern section of the 
capital, a Shiite Muslim stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
The gutted wreckage of the yellow bus straddled a curb in an Aoun-controlled 
area, a few yards east of the gateway. It is the only crossing along the 
so-called Green Line that separates East Beirut from mostly Muslim West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was hit a few hours after a blast ripped through Aoun's Defense 
Ministry in the suburb of Yarze, killing at least two men. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's forces said in a communique that the blast occurred when soldiers were 
moving confiscated ammunition. However, Muslim radio reports said the explosion 
was aimed at Aoun's troops.

ANALYSIS / TRADE DEFICIT; 
</P>
<P>
NEW SCHOOL OF THINKING FINDS DOOMSDAY ON IMPORTS UNLIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the dire warnings that America's spree of import-buying would bring on 
a "Day of Reckoning?" That the nation's mounting foreign debt -- needed to 
finance the lingering trade deficit -- will end up mortgaging future 
generations of Americans? 
</P>
<P>
Well, tear up the doom manual: The huge global imbalances -- the United States' 
deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan -- are beginning to shrink 
and may even disappear before very long, according to a new school of thinking 
that is beginning to catch Washington's eye. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore this growing belief, the Commerce Department reported 
Wednesday that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed dramatically in February to $6.4 
billion, its best performance in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists now believe the trade deficit problem could fade in as little 
as two or three years. "It's already under way," says Jerry L. Jordan, a former 
member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and now at First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Reversal 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, new figures for Japan are breathtaking. By the fourth quarter of last 
year, Tokyo's current account surplus -- a measure that includes both trade and 
investment flows -- had plunged to half its 1987 average of $84.5 billion and 
is still shrinking rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese turnaround reflects several factors: a sharp increase in imports 
over the past few years, made even costlier by the recent decline in the value 
of the yen; the increasing tendency of Japanese corporations to manufacture 
their products in overseas plants instead of in Japan, and burgeoning tourism 
by travel-starved Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's surplus is also about to shrivel rapidly, these economists say, 
as Bonn channels its money into the rebuilding of East Germany and absorbs it 
into a reunified German state. What little may be left could quickly be 
invested elsewhere in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan and others predict, the United States' current account 
deficit -- again, encompassing both trade and investment flows -- also will 
begin to shrink sharply within the next three or four years, as exports 
continue to rise, particularly in high-value items such as computers and 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very very competitive in those sorts of things, and that's what people 
are going to need," Jordan says. "Overall, you're going to see the trade 
situation improve -- and fast." 
</P>
<P>
If such optimism proves to be correct, it won't be the first time that the 
economic doomsayers have wound up embarrassed about how deftly the economy has 
been able to right itself. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, points out 
that the economy is operating successfully today at a lower rate of growth, far 
higher inflation and slower gains in productivity than was thought possible 
just 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"American policy could continue more or less on its current course for many 
years without any crisis," Krugman says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Advise Caution 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is convinced that the trade imbalances -- or the economic 
situation -- will improve rapidly, as the optimists suggest. 
</P>
<P>
C. Fred Bergsten, an analyst at the Institute for International Economics in 
Washington, stands by his earlier forecast that the U.S. trade and current 
account deficits will begin widening again in 1990 and 1991. "The situation 
basically hasn't changed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
J. Paul Horne, Paris-based international economist for Smith Barney, Harris 
Upham Co. cautions that demands for rebuilding Eastern Europe and revitalizing 
the European market generally may draw investment away from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It would put a rising floor under U.S. interest rates," Horne says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, America's own internal financial problems are threatening to throw a 
monkey wrench into the economic expansion here -- a development that could 
rapidly degenerate into a full-fledged recession if the trade and current 
account imbalances persist. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some industries -- such as services and retailing -- may be 
hard-pressed no matter what the situation. "It's not going to be a plus for 
everyone," Jordan asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, for now, at least, the numbers are turning out to be far less scary 
than predicted. By rights, the Day of Reckoning should have appeared by now. In 
fact, it may never come. 
</P>

U.S. SEEKING FACTS ON REFINERY SITUATION; 
</P>
<P>
LITHUANIA: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THE SOVIETS SHUT 
OFF THE OIL FLOW TO THE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bush Administration officials anxiously sought to determine Wednesday whether 
Soviet authorities have cut off oil supplies to Lithuania's only refinery, as 
asserted by officials of the Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
"We have conflicting reports, and we're looking into the situation," a White 
House official said, declining to go beyond President Bush's warning Tuesday 
that such a step would be met with "appropriate responses" by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The development, if confirmed, appears to move the United States closer to 
taking punitive action toward the Soviet Union -- a step fraught with potential 
diplomatic repercussions -- for the first time since relations between 
Washington and Moscow began to warm a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
It also demonstrated the dilemma that Bush faces as he seeks to apply some 
pressure on the Soviet Union over its handling of the Lithuanian crisis without 
painting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev into a political corner. 
</P>
<P>
The President's go-slow approach to Lithuania's efforts to secede from the 
Soviet Union fit the pattern he has established for Administration responses to 
foreign policy developments, particularly those that threaten to unravel 
long-established relationships. 
</P>
<P>
But the declaration of independence issued by the Lithuanian Parliament on 
March 11 has forced Bush to deal with a long-held U.S. policy under which the 
Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940 has never 
been officially accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to explain the President's approach, a White House official said the 
Administration favors eventual Lithuanian independence but also supports 
Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet political and economic life. The White 
House believes those reforms could be threatened if Gorbachev is politically 
weakened by a successful Lithuanian secession. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is clear: We would like to see Lithuania free and clear," a senior 
White House official said. "We think if any explosion is avoided, it's going to 
happen. It may take a while." 
</P>
<P>
The official continued: "You can state your goals and your principles. But 
going beyond that almost inevitably can be grist for somebody's mill for 
ratcheting up the situation. Then you become part of the problem. You're 
backing Gorbachev into a corner, making him look bad. The feeling here is any 
influence we have is best wielded completely behind the scenes. But from a 
public standpoint, it's a loser." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a National Security Council meeting held late Tuesday before 
news reports indicated that the oil flow had been curtailed, the Administration 
had reiterated its warning that the United States would mount "appropriate 
responses" if the Soviet Union carried out its threat to impose an economic 
squeeze on Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee, Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III warned that "Soviet actions -- even short of force -- 
in Lithuania" are putting "commercial contacts" between the two countries "to 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
But Baker declined to spell out what action the Administration might take. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "it's a matter of 
watching and waiting to see what happens. The problem is that we've been going 
through this process for a month or two -- and there's all kinds of maneuvering 
going on back and forth between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. And therefore, 
we don't try to spend a whole lot of time by reading the tea leaves about what 
might happen or what they think's going to happen or so forth."

2 CRUSADERS FOR JUSTICE OR 2 GRAND INQUISITORS?;

SOVIET UNION: THE EXPLOITS -- AND WOES -- OF THE TWO EMBATTLED INVESTIGATORS 
HAVE POLARIZED THE NATION.

It is the longest-running political morality play of the Gorbachev era, a 
controversy so heated that it brings throngs of people into the streets when 
their two idols seem threatened by the Soviet high and mighty. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-corruption investigators Telman K. Gdlyan and Nikolai V. Ivanov were once 
again the focus of attention this week as the Soviet lawmakers debated whether 
to strip them of the parliamentary immunity they enjoy as members of the Soviet 
Congress so that they may be tried. 
</P>
<P>
An hour-long warning strike was called in Leningrad on Tuesday, and thousands 
rallied there and in Moscow to oppose any attack on their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"By defending Gdlyan and Ivanov, we defend liberty and democracy!" one speaker 
told the Leningrad crowd. Outside the Kremlin, 10,000 massed to hail the 
erstwhile law enforcers now accused of being lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Soviet's 275-84 decision sharply restricting their comments, 
arrived at Wednesday after two days of debate, will only perpetuate controversy 
over the two, who parlayed their reputation as incorruptible public servants 
into seats in the Congress of People's Deputies last year. 
</P>
<P>
For although Gdlyan and Ivanov are crusaders for justice in the eyes of their 
many admirers, they seem like McCarthyite inquisitors to others, sham believers 
in legality who accuse the innocent, up to and including President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, of involvement in corruption without ever offering concrete proof, 
apparently seeking personal or political gain. 
</P>
<P>
"It would seem to me that this is a return to the practices of the 1930s," KGB 
Chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, whose agency admittedly has had firsthand 
experience with summary justice, told the Supreme Soviet in a reference to the 
forced confessions and show trials of Stalin's Great Terror. "Gdlyan and Ivanov 
are involved in adventurism at a state level." 
</P>
<P>
The legislature, conscious of the outpouring of popular anger that could result 
from overly harsh treatment of the two men, rejected the call by Prosecutor 
General Alexander Y. Sukharev to allow criminal proceedings against them but 
did put them under a virtual gag order. It warned them that further 
"groundless" statements jeopardizing the country's stability would lead to the 
lifting of their parliamentary immunity. 
</P>
<P>
The legislature also gave its consent to their dismissal as state 
investigators, posts that had given them virtual folk-hero status because of 
their fabulously successful six-year probe of senior government and Communist 
Party officials in Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The political fortunes of the pair are a unique barometer of the widespread 
popular frustrations and distrust in officialdom during the sixth year of 
Gorbachev's tenure as Soviet leader, and may be likened to the surge in Boris 
N. Yeltsin's popularity every time Communist Party or government officials try 
to denigrate him. 
</P>
<P>
"Some radical groups today simply use Gdlyan and Ivanov as a battering ram for 
destroying the bastions of power," said Moscow jurist Konstantin D. 
Lubenchenko, who sat on the special commission the Soviet Congress created to 
scrutinize the two men's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Gdlyan is the former head and Ivanov the former deputy chief of a group set up 
by the prosecutor's office to investigate corruption in Uzbekistan. This led to 
the arrests of 62 officials involved in the falsification of cotton production 
figures, the confiscation of about $58-million worth of ill-gotten assets and 
evidence that implicated members of the ruling elite of the Leonid I. Brezhnev 
era, including the former president's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov. Churbanov, 
convicted of bribe-taking, was sent to labor camp. 
</P>
<P>
Had the investigators stopped there, they might have remained honored members 
of the Soviet prosecutor's staff. But the falling-out with authorities 
apparently took place in the summer of 1988, when the pair made public their 
investigation of a number of senior Communist Party officials who had been 
subordinates of Yegor K. Ligachev, now the voice of ideological orthodoxy on 
the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
During a live TV program in May, 1988, Ivanov claimed that Ligachev, as well as 
former Politburo members Grigory V. Romanov and Mikhail S. Solomentsev, were 
personally involved in the corruption network. All 209 members of Gdlyan's 
group were fired in the days that followed, and the prosecutor general, 
Sukharev, began preparing a criminal case dealing with "violations of legality 
by a group . . . headed by T. Gdlyan." 
</P>
<P>
The investigators' accusations, and the government's rapid reaction, convinced 
many Soviet citizens that the party machine and law enforcement organs were 
festering nests of organized crime. For people who must line up to buy bread or 
foul-smelling sausage as their well-fed rulers race by in limousines, Gdlyan 
and Ivanov took on the stature of popular avengers, bringing the bosses to 
account in their interest. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, any attack on the two seemed to many Soviets to be an assault on 
the egalitarian idea that even their rulers should have to answer before the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Also, because Ligachev was a target, the controversy assumed an ideological 
dimension: conservatives vs. radicals. When Ligachev denied any role in 
corruption and was given a clean bill by the party's Central Committee in 
September, it seemed that the Old Guard was protecting its own. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are no "white hats" in this dispute, whatever rank-and-file 
Soviets may think. Publications, some of which cannot be suspected of 
anti-Gdlyan and Ivanov leanings, have bared Star Chamber-like techniques used 
in their probe, including these: 
</P>
<P>
To force confessions, the investigators reportedly arrested the wives and 
children of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet law prohibits holding an individual without trial for more than 
nine months, former top-ranking officials were kept in custody by the Gdlyan 
group for between three and six years. 
</P>
<P>
Under rising attack from the legal establishment, Gdlyan and Ivanov charged 
that the Politburo, the Supreme Court, senior officials in the prosecutor's 
office and the current leadership of the KGB are enmeshed in a conspiracy to 
protect the Soviet "mafia." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the two investigators can or will keep silent when their pronouncements 
have brought them such political prominence seems doubtful. They were absent 
from the Supreme Soviet while it weighed their fate, and Kryuchkov told the 
puzzled deputies that KGB operatives had found them -- running for election in 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy seemed obvious: If shorn of their immunity as deputies in the Soviet 
Congress, Gdlyan and Ivanov could still avoid prosecution, and presumbly still 
keep speaking out, as newly elected members of Armenia's legislature.

BOARD RECOMMENDS FREEDOM FOR AWARD-WINNING PRISON JOURNALIST

<P>
The Louisiana Pardon Board on Wednesday recommended that Wilbert Rideau, a 
convicted murderer who became an award-winning journalist behind bars, be set 
free after 29 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision will be made by Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has cited the 
viciousness of Rideau's crimes in refusing to commute his life sentence in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's decision, Roemer said he had no plans to do so now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult, I wish I had an easy answer. But my inclination is not to 
accept their recommendation," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board voted unanimously to reduce the 48-year-old prison 
magazine editor's sentence to 55 years, which defense attorney Julian Murray 
said would qualify him for immediate release. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the same recommendation this board made in 1988," said board 
chairwoman Yvonne Campbell. "It was based on his prison record, his 
accomplishments, and he has only had one write-up in his 29 years in prison." 
</P>
<P>
Two board members also recommended that Rideau be required to leave the state 
permanently, contribute part of the earnings from his writing to a victims' 
reparation fund and be ordered to perform some community service. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau was sentenced to death for the 1961 murder of a bank teller in an armed 
robbery. His sentence was commuted to life in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court 
overturned the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Some argued against clemency. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Bryant, an assistant prosecutor in Calcasieu Parish, called the 
premeditated robbery and murder one of the most heinous ever in the parish. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spoken with people who are still terrified of Wilbert Rideau," Bryant 
said. "We do believe Mr. Rideau has received his clemency. He's not dead."

BUSH CLARIFIES HIS CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY, PUTS MORE STRESS ON ACTION

President Bush concluded an international gathering of scientists, economists 
and environmentalists Wednesday by asserting that his Administration has "never 
considered research a substitute for action" in addressing the threat of global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow a question like climate change to be characterized as a debate 
(of) economists versus environmentalists," Bush said in remarks interpreted by 
conference participants as a softening of the position he took only a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, strong economies allow nations to fulfill the obligations of 
stewardship -- and environmental stewardship is crucial to sustaining strong 
economies," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's remarks came as he closed a two-day White House session during which 
delegations from 17 countries heard the President and top Administration 
officials stress the scientific uncertainties and profound economic 
implications of the global warming debate. 
</P>
<P>
European delegates had criticized the conference agenda's emphasis on 
scientific and economic research rather than steps to reduce emissions of 
so-called greenhouse pollutants that many scientists believe may lead to 
catastrophic warming of the Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
But as he closed the heavily publicized session, Bush said: "Those who suggest 
that we're only trying to balance economic growth and environmental protection 
. . . miss the point. We are calling for an entirely new way of thinking, to 
achieve both, while compromising neither, by applying the power of the market 
place in the service of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
The European representatives, who had complained that all of the public 
conference sessions were taken up with American speeches, were pleased with 
Bush's conclusion of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is the start of a change in the American attitude," said Pier 
Vellinga, director of the climate change program in the Netherlands. 
"Yesterday, he said we cannot act until we have more facts. Today it was much 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly said there was 
"no question that the President heard the delegates."

HOUSE DEMOCRATS PROPOSE SHARP CUTBACKS IN DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: LEADERS CALL FOR REDUCING SPENDING BY 25% OVER 5 YEARS. PLAN WOULD 
ALLOCATE $251 BILLION TO DEFICIT REDUCTION AND NEW DOMESTIC PROGRAMS.

House Democratic leaders unveiled a proposed 1991 budget Wednesday that would 
cut defense spending by 25% over the next five years and allocate the resulting 
$251 billion "peace dividend" to deficit reduction and a series of new domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with a cut of $8 billion from President Bush's proposed Pentagon 
outlays for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the Democratic plan calls for 
ever larger reductions in future years that would require eliminating such 
weapons systems as the MX or the Midgetman missile. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee 
and author of the Democratic budget proposal, said the measure would be 
submitted for the panel's approval today and could come up for debate on the 
House floor next week. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, he acknowledged that a House-passed budget 
resolution could be only the first step in a long series of negotiations with 
the Senate and the White House to resolve differences over defense spending 
cuts and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats are more divided over the budget than their House 
counterparts. While Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) has 
recommended far bigger cuts in military spending, he apparently has little 
support, and some observers believe the Senate panel will be deadlocked on that 
and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
The House Democratic plan calls for raising $13.9 billion in new revenues in 
the coming fiscal year -- the same amount proposed by Bush -- but leaves it to 
the House Ways and Means Committee to figure out how to achieve the goal. Key 
lawmakers have said it will be impossible to pass tax increases of that 
magnitude without the President's active support. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) will have to negotiate with the 
White House on the revenue package, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for $9.1 billion in "other savings and adjustments." 
Panetta said that amount includes $4.2 billion in new user fees, $3 billion 
from Internal Revenue Service management reforms and $1.6 billion in asset 
sales proposed by Bush in his budget. 
</P>
<P>
When the President put those items in his spending blueprint, Democrats 
denounced them as budgetary "smoke and mirrors" that reflected wishful thinking 
rather than realistic savings projections. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Democratic plan calls for a sharp reduction in defense outlays and 
a moderate rise in domestic spending for programs dealing with children, 
health, housing, nutrition, science, research, job retraining and aid to 
emerging Eastern European democracies. 
</P>
<P>
In the key defense area, which is expected to be the primary focus of this 
year's budget debate, the House proposal follows a middle course between deeper 
cuts favored by House liberals and the small increase advocated by Bush and 
most Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta's plan calls for $295.5 billion in military outlays in fiscal 1991.

SHUTTLE LAUNCH ADVANCED A DAY

Engineers successfully test fired a new hydraulic power unit aboard the shuttle 
Discovery on Wednesday, prompting NASA to move up the delayed launch of the 
Hubble Space Telescope from next Wednesday to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone believes we're now ready to fly and all of us are looking forward to 
the data the Hubble Space Telescope will produce as it begins its exploration 
of the universe," shuttle program chief Robert Crippen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the launch is to be at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday, 14 days after 
the ship was grounded by a malfunction in its power steering system. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery and its $1.5-billion payload, the most expensive satellite ever 
built, were grounded April 10 just four minutes before liftoff when one of the 
shuttle's three auxiliary power units malfunctioned. The APUs provide hydraulic 
power to the shuttle's engines and wing flaps for steering during the climb to 
space. 
</P>
<P>
A replacement APU was installed in Discovery's cramped engine room over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
With Discovery declared shipshape for launch, engineers pressed on with a 5 
1/2-day procedure to recharge the Hubble Space Telescope's batteries for a 
second launch attempt. The batteries, removed from the telescope Sunday, will 
be back at full power Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the APU replacement ahead of schedule was a major achievement for 
NASA.

MURRAY SHAKES UP GIANTS, 6-2

A few comments from the Dodgers on a series of four earthquakes, the strongest 
measuring 5.4 on the Richter Scale, that jolted the Bay Area just before 7 a.m. 
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tim Crews: "Scared the heck out of me. I called Jay Howell and said, 'Man, 
this don't cut it, it just don't cut it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tim Belcher: "Woke me up, and couldn't go back to sleep. I hated it. Just 
hated it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eddie Murray: "Slept right through it." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to guess which one hit two homers against the San Francisco Giants 
Wednesday afternoon -- one left-handed and the other right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we get enough of those things," Murray said about earthquakes, not home 
runs, after leading the Dodgers to a 6-2 victory and a sweep of this two-game 
set at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
If he sounded calm, it was because he was forced to be. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day that began with a couple of Dodgers so frightened by the 
earthquakes that they left their downtown hotel for the ballpark four hours 
before the game. The earthquakes reportedly caused no injuries and minor 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The day ended with relief pitcher Crews, whose third child was born Wednesday 
morning, nearly blowing it all by loading the bases in the ninth inning for 
Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell. He retired both. 
</P>
<P>
In between, three Dodger pitchers, including Crews, gave up 14 hits but were 
saved by some spectacular fielding. If not for a couple of diving stops by 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin, and throws by left-fielder Kal Daniels and second 
baseman Willie Randolph that resulted in runners being tagged out by catcher 
Mike Scioscia at home plate, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make those plays, we are still playing," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the only one not blinking was Murray, who added a first-inning 
single and is hitting .333 in 10 games, with three homers and nine runs batted 
in. So, chalk up this victory -- one that made the Dodgers 5-3 on the road -- 
to one of the National League's newest veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the difference in Eddie this year," said Randolph, who watched 
Murray for many seasons when they were in the American League before both 
joined the Dodgers last year. "This is the Eddie I know -- very relaxed, 
waiting on pitches, not trying to do everything himself. He is used to the 
league now, and he's making the pitchers come to him. 
</P>
<P>
"And when that happens, well, I've seen Eddie do serious damage." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Eric Gunderson and Randy O'Neal also have seen it. With two out in the 
third inning and the score tied, 1-1, Murray hit Gunderson's first pitch high 
over the left-field fence. Because Gunderson is a left-hander, the 
switch-hitting Murray was batting right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Four innings later against O'Neal, with one out and the Dodgers protecting a 
4-2 lead, Murray skied an 0-1 pitch over the right-field fence. This time 
Murray was batting left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth time in his 14-year career that Murray has homered from both 
sides of the plate in the same game. That is one shy of the record of 10, held 
by Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice, but I think other people can do that," Murray said. "You have to 
get lucky, to get your pitches on days when both a lefty and a righty are 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Murray thinks a more insurmountable record is one he holds as the only player 
to hit homers from both sides of the plate on consecutive days. It happened May 
8 and 9, 1987 in Chicago. "That's going to be the tough one," he said. "That's 
the one I'm proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said that after spending last season seeing pitchers for the first time, 
this season every pitch is looking much clearer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of getting comfortable seeing people," he said of his quick 
start. "Sometimes you find something you can pay attention to, sometimes you 
can't. But the more you see people, the better off you are." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda agreed with those reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said before spring training, expect Eddie to do much better this year 
because he knows the pitchers better," Lasorda said. "Also, whenever a guy 
comes over in a trade, he has a tendency to try too hard, to try and show 
everybody that they made a good trade. A guy's second year is always better." 
</P>
<P>
In sealing the victory for Dodger starter Mike Morgan, who allowed two runs on 
10 hits in 6 1/3 innings, Murray also made it easier for Crews. 
</P>
<P>
Crews had just gotten off the phone with his wife, Laurie, in Orlando, Fla., 
early Wednesday morning, having just learned of the birth of son Travis Blair, 
and was sitting on his bed when it shook. 
</P>
<P>
He called Howell, and they hurriedly packed their bags and left the hotel. They 
arrived at Candlestick just after 8 a.m., even though the game was not supposed 
to start until 12:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"No way was I staying in a high-rise hotel with all of that stuff going on," 
Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he found himself pitching in the eighth inning with the Dodgers leading, 
5-2. He gave up two hits to start the eighth before retiring three Giants on 
two foul balls and a strikeout. Then in the ninth, with one out, he walked 
pinch-hitter Gary Carter and allowed singles to Brett Butler and Kevin Bass, 
loading the bases for Clark. 
</P>
<P>
But he struck out Clark on five pitches and retired Mitchell on a foul out to 
end the game. The save, Crews' first, equaled his number of major league saves 
for the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"When it got down to it, I wasn't thinking anything," Crews said. "I just threw 
it up there and hoped they would hit my best pitch." 
</P>

Said Clark, whose Giants are off to the worst home start in San Francisco 
history at 0-5: "We have to start playing better, pure and simple. We get teams 
down, we don't put them away. We get runners on base, we don't get clutch hits. 
End of story."

Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Alfredo Griffin's diving stop of Terry Kennedy's ground ball in the 
fourth inning, resulting in a force out and saving a run, may eventually hurt 
the Dodgers. Griffin said his back began hurting after the game. Already this 
spring, he has suffered from back spasms. Griffin's back apparently didn't hurt 
during the game, as he made two other sprawling catches to save runs. . . . Kal 
Daniels had the Dodgers' first outfield assist at home plate in the first 
inning, throwing out Kevin Mitchell by five steps to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Willie Randolph had another assist at the plate in the fourth 
inning as he took Juan Samuel's throw from center field and easily threw out 
Kennedy to end another inning. . . . Hubie Brooks finished the Dodger scoring 
with a ninth-inning home run off reliever Ernie Camacho, Brooks' first homer 
since opening day. Brooks doubled in the fifth inning but tripped while running 
toward third base. He had to crawl back to second base. "Embarrassed as hell," 
Brooks said of the play, which ended with him lying on second base, covering 
his head with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton may attempt to return to third base today to test his sore 
shoulder. . . . Jim Gott, recovering from last year's elbow surgery, has 
advanced to the point where he could throw batting practice as soon as today. . 
. . Dave Anderson, longtime Dodger infielder who signed with the Giants as a 
free agent last winter, said he made the decision after the Dodgers would not 
change their offer of $420,000 for one season after the Giants had offered him 
$1.1 million for two seasons.

MIKE DOWNEY: NICE ON ICE WON'T CUT IT HERE

EDMONTON, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, King family: We won't suggest anything too outrageous here. We don't want 
any drastic line changes, Wayne Gretzky benched in favor of Mike Allison or 
anything like that. We shouldn't get too worked up about one lousy loss. And we 
definitely wouldn't advocate that you start playing, uh, dirty hockey. Don't go 
around shish kebabing anybody with your sticks. 
</P>
<P>
But, to beat the Edmonton Oilers, you might have to beat them up. Check 'em, 
deck 'em and wreck 'em. Otherwise, these oily little rascals are just too 
slick. Unless you smack them around and slow them down, the Oilers will leave 
your defensemen as frozen in their tracks as the Gretzky statue that guards the 
door of the Northlands Coliseum, and they will leave your goaltender flopping 
on his belly like a seal. 
</P>
<P>
Right from Wednesday night's opening faceoff of the Smythe Division finals, the 
Oilers demonstrated their superior quickness and stickness. Glenn Anderson put 
a move on King goalie Kelly Hrudey the likes of which hasn't been seen in 
Alberta since Katarina Witt slipped into her lace teddy. He scored. Five 
minutes later, Jari Kurri did a dipsy-do that left Hrudey sprawling flat on 
his, uh, mask. Another score. 
</P>
<P>
Came the next two periods and more of the same. Mark Messier slapped one. 
Score. Martin Gelinas flipped one over the goalie's glove. Score. Esa Tikkanen 
bluffed a slap shot and faked Hrudey into the organist's private box. Score. 
Joe Murphy made Hrudey go into a dive like the "Red October." Score. Tikkanen 
tikked another one in. Score. Game 1 turned into an Edmonton avalanche, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about losing ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe for the Kings it was just one of those nights when the only thing that 
goes right is that your suspenders don't snap. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe, just maybe, this was a classic case of a bunch of guys taking too 
much time off for good behavior. Maybe the time has come for the Kings to turn 
back into the Manchester Blvd. Bullies, same way they did when they pounded 
lumps on Edmonton's helmets last time they met. 
</P>
<P>
When the King-Oiler rumble turned gruesome at the Forum on the final night of 
February, everybody made note of the 86 penalties and 356 penalty minutes that 
made this game the nastiest confrontation in the Los Angeles area since the 
last time Roseanne Barr's writers had a staff meeting. Oh, the fuss that was 
made over Marty McSorley, the mutant ninja hockey player, doing his level best 
to mess up Messier's face. 
</P>
<P>
Forgotten in all the commotion was that the Kings won that particular game, 
4-2. And face it, they don't ordinarily have much luck against Edmonton, 
regardless of how that 1989 playoff series turned out. The Oilers played the 
Kings eight times this season, and lost to them only twice. Edmonton has had 
L.A.'s number, and we don't mean 99. 
</P>
<P>
If Wednesday's game is any indication of how this series is going to go, may we 
humbly suggest that when the Oilers take the ice here Friday night, the Kings 
go right out and crown them. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, we were just sort of getting comfortable with the notion of L.A. as a 
tough hockey town. These were becoming the all-new, leaner, meaner Kings, bad 
boys dressed in black. Nobody was accusing them of turning into the 
Philadelphia Flyers, but 356 penalty minutes -- man, that's not hockey, that's 
mud-wrestling. That's some dirty stuff. 
</P>
<P>
And the Kings haven't been making many friends lately, either. Some of them 
were offended by former teammate Bernie Nicholls' alleged comment that the only 
thing the Kings know about defense is how not to play it. There was also some 
fuss made over Theron Fleury of Calgary supposedly hurling his stick at Gretzky 
and calling him "the most hated player in the league," and Flame Paul Ranheim 
accusing Gretzky of waving his arms and laughing right in the Flames' faces. 
</P>
<P>
It was kind of nice having people bad-mouthing the Kings for a change. In the 
past, people hardly mentioned them at all. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, though, the Kings who laced up their skates for Game 1 against Edmonton 
were about as inoffensive as a hockey team gets. We can scarcely remember a 
hard check into the boards, much less a punch in the snoot. Oh, McSorley gave 
Kevin Lowe a little love bump as the first period was ending, and later on Lowe 
and Steve Duchesne demonstrated surgical techniques to each other's eyebrows 
with their sticks. Otherwise, the Kings played like perfect gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
And came away with a big fat zero. 
</P>
<P>
OK, Kings: You tried the polite bit. You tried to be nice, pleasant guests. You 
probably wiped your feet before stepping into the arena. It didn't work. The 
Oilers still have to beat you three more times. Beat them to the punch.

The Chicago Bears said published reports had exaggerated the amount of taxes in 
dispute between the Internal Revenue Service and the team's owners. 
</P>
<P>
The National reported that the IRS was seeking about $43.5 million in gift and 
inheritance taxes stemming from a 1981 reorganization of the team. The 
newspaper said interest and penalties could drive the assessment to more than 
$50 million.

When defensive back Raymond Clayborn left the New England Patriots to join the 
Cleveland Browns, he said, "I'm going to miss all my friends in the media in 
Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Wonder if that includes Will McDonough of the Boston Globe and CBS Sports? 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Clayborn and McDonough had a confrontation in the locker room after a 
game. When Clayborn threatened to do McDonough physical harm, McDonough hauled 
off and slugged him. 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: It turns out that Alexander Volkov of the Atlanta 
Hawks had a system when he won the team pool on the NCAA Final Four. He picked 
all the schools he faced two years ago on a tour with the Soviet Union's 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: The nerdy professor who explains how Michael Jordan 
overcomes gravity in that shoe commercial is not an actor but the real thing. 
He's Lt. Col. Douglas Kirkpatrick, head of astronautics at the Air Force 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
According to USA Today, Kirkpatrick was flawless in his delivery, except on one 
take. He said Michael Jackson, instead of Michael Jordan.

Trivia time: What do CBS announcer Jim Nantz and golfer Fred Couples have in 
common?

No copies: From Mike Littwin of the Baltimore Sun, hailing Jim Murray for his 
Pulitzer Prize: "I was once a young writer on the Los Angeles Times, and like 
all young writers on The Times, I wanted to be Jim Murray. I tried. You don't 
know how hard I tried. Finally, an old hand came to me and said, 'Son, there's 
only one Jim Murray. Try to be somebody else.' " 
</P>
<P>
Red-faced: From Red Auerbach, conceding that the Boston Celtics made a mistake 
when they drafted Michael Smith in the first round: "We would have taken Vlade 
Divac. But we didn't know he could play." 
</P>
<P>
Divac, with his fierce beard, looks like a grizzled veteran, but he's only 22. 
Smith will be 25 next month. 
</P>

A survivor: Houston Astro reliever Larry Andersen earns almost $1 million a 
year, but he figures he has paid his dues. At 19, he pitched at Reno, where his 
record was 4-14 with a 6.53 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the year I was the player-clubhouse man," he told the Houston 
Chronicle. "Our clubhouse guy quit, and I took the job for an extra $10 a week. 
It helped me make the payment on the trailer I was living in. It was 8-by-30 
and went for $62.50 a month."

Fashion note: The Missouri Valley conference has switched from striped shirts 
to gray shirts for its officials. Says official Jim Bain: "We are no longer 
referred to as the zebras. Now, we're the bedspreads."

Tall research: From Eric Montross, the highly recruited 7-footer from 
Indianapolis who obviously did his homework before choosing North Carolina: 
"Ten of the 17 big men recruited by North Carolina in the last 20 years were 
first-round draft choices in the NBA."

A New Jersey judge Wednesday issued a ruling that may have cleared the way for 
a Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield heavyweight championship fight in September. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Amos Saunders, ruling in favor of Holyfield, upheld an injunction that 
permits purse bids to proceed for a title fight with Douglas, the world 
heavyweight champion, promoters for Holyfield, the No. 1 contender, announced. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, in upholding a temporary restraining order won by Holyfield's 
lawyers, prevented Douglas, promoter Don King, Las Vegas' Mirage Hotel or any 
others from interfering with purse bid procedures for a Holyfield-Douglas bout.

ANGELS SHARE THE BLAME AFTER 12-INNING LOSS TO A'S; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: LANGSTON THREW A PICKOFF ATTEMPT AWAY, AND RAY FAILED TO TURN A 
DOUBLE PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blame was his, Mark Langston said, for the errant pickoff throw in the 
sixth inning that set up the Oakland Athletics' fifth run Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't throw the ball away in that situation and turn it into a situation 
where they just have to tap balls to score," he said. "I think we showed we can 
play with them. If I'd done a little better and done my part, it would have 
been different." 
</P>
<P>
No, second baseman Johnny Ray said, the blame was his for not turning a 
12th-inning double play on what he called "a tailor-made ball" hit by Carney 
Lansford that put the winning run on base. "I even knocked the ball down and 
had time to get Carney (at first)," Ray said. "No question, it was a 
double-play ball." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader wasn't blaming anybody. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel manager praised his players for things they did right in the 7-5 loss 
to the A's at Anaheim Stadium. But when things went wrong, they went wrong 
enough to spoil the comeback, sparked by Dante Bichette's three-run home run in 
the sixth, and saddle the Angels with a disappointing defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Frequently a good effort is overshadowed by something that didn't turn out 
particularly well," Rader said. "I like the way we competed. We certainly could 
have had more than two runs going into the sixth. We hit a lot of balls on the 
button. The fact that those balls didn't fall early was important." 
</P>
<P>
A combination of three relievers held the Angels to one hit in the final six 
innings, while the A's capitalized on a bad throw to first base by Langston -- 
a two-time Gold Glove winner -- and two favorable hops in the 12th to get Mike 
Norris his first major league victory since May 16, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland had a 4-2 lead when Langston walked Dave Henderson to lead off the 
sixth. While trying to hold Henderson at first, he threw the ball past Wally 
Joyner, giving Henderson two extra bases. Henderson scored on Lance 
Blankenship's suicide squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you have to play very well against Oakland, and I think we did," said 
Langston, who said he had better stuff than in his seven hitless innings 
against Seattle last Wednesday. He gave up seven hits and four earned runs 
Tuesday. "I don't think I did my job." 
</P>
<P>
Ray's job in the 12th -- after Walt Weiss led off with a single, was forced at 
second by Stan Javier and went to third on Rickey Henderson's single to left -- 
was to turn Lansford's grounder into a double play. He didn't. He got Lansford 
at first, but Javier scored, and Henderson scored on a single to center field 
by Jose Canseco off Mark Eichhorn (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
"It came up on me. I missed the ball, and that was it," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't it. Rader made sure to come over afterward and console him with a 
pat on the shoulder and words of encouragement. "Don't let it get you down," 
Rader advised. 
</P>
<P>
Ray shook his head. "It's only eight games into the season. There's 
150-something left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rader wasn't finished. "It's not that," he said, "it's that you've been playing 
great defense." 
</P>
<P>
One lapse, though, was all the A's needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Against a ballclub like the A's, you've got to win the game," Chili Davis 
said. "You can't ever think you have the game won. You've got to go out and 
score and score some more. 
</P>
<P>
"They're world champions and they're supposed to be cocky. That's how they got 
to be world champions."

BRIND'AMOUR HELPS BLUES GET THE JUMP ON BLACKHAWKS, 4-3

Rookie Rod Brind'Amour scored two goals and Rick Meagher and Brett Hull one 
each Wednesday night, leading the St. Louis Blues to a 4-3 victory over the 
Chicago Blackhawks in the opening game of their second-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
The victory took away the home-ice advantage for Chicago, which finished first 
in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues grabbed a 4-1 lead midway in the second period before the Blackhawks 
staged a comeback that fell short after goalie Greg Millen was replaced by Ed 
Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago put on the pressure in the final period but couldn't offset the tight 
checking of the Blues. With 42 seconds remaining, the Blackhawks pulled Belfour 
for a sixth attacker, but were stopped cold by goalie Vincent Riendeau. 
</P>
<P>
Riendeau was playing in place of Curtis Joseph, who suffered a shoulder injury 
in the final game of the Toronto series and is expected to miss two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues held a 5-2-1 edge over the Blackhawks and were 3-1 at Chicago during 
the regular season.

Grant Fuhr, once described by former teammate Wayne Gretzky as the world's best 
goaltender, was not in the nets for the Edmonton Oilers Wednesday night at the 
Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But that was of no help to the punchless Kings. They put 25 shots on goal 
against Bill Ranford, who turned all of them back. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' 7-0 victory in Game 1 of the best-of-seven Smythe Division final 
playoff series was Ranford's first postseason shutout and only the third 
playoff shutout for the four-time Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fuhr, who had the other two but will not play again this season because of 
a shoulder injury: "You can't play any better than (Ranford has) played. They 
needed good goaltending and he's giving it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Ranford was especially effective in the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think the (scoring) opportunities were about the same in the first 
period, but Billy came up with the big saves and we came out with a 2-0 lead," 
Oiler Coach John Muckler said. "And then when L.A. didn't come back after we 
killed some penalties in the second period, we dominated." 
</P>
<P>
But Ranford took little credit for shutting down the NHL's second-best 
offensive team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a breather and it just so happened that I got the shutout," he said. "I 
didn't even care. It wasn't on my mind. What's important is the win and we were 
just able to relax and play a disciplined game." 
</P>
<P>
But Oiler defenseman Charlie Huddy said of his 23-year-old teammate: "I can't 
say enough about the way Billy has played in the playoffs. Everybody was on top 
of him after that first game (a 7-5 loss against the Winnipeg Jets last week), 
but he has rebounded and he's starting to prove that he's among the league's 
upper echelon." 
</P>
<P>
With Fuhr limited to 11 appearances this season because of an appendectomy and 
a shoulder injury, Ranford was 24-16-9 with a 3.19 goals-against average as the 
Oilers established a club record by allowing only 283 goals during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Oilers hadn't started a playoff game without Fuhr in almost three 
years before Ranford started Game 1 of a Smythe Division semifinal series 
against the Jets, and Ranford obviously was nervous. 
</P>
<P>
After the 7-5 defeat in which he often was so out of position that he was 
forced to make acrobatic saves even on routine shots, he was widely criticized 
by the Edmonton media and the demanding Oiler fans. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Oilers won the series with a 4-1 victory in Game 7 Monday night, 
Ranford was called a hero in headlines the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"He might have been a little tight," Fuhr said of Ranford's Game 1 performance 
last week, "but he has settled down." 
</P>
<P>
Much to the Kings' chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernie Nicholls was traded by the Kings to the New York Rangers in 
mid-January for Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom, he placed most of the blame 
on Coach Tom Webster of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls called it "a dumb deal." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, after the Kings eliminated the Calgary Flames from the 
playoffs, Nicholls was quoted in the National as saying, "What is surprising is 
that the Kings could be coached into playing some defense." 
</P>
<P>
But Nicholls denies the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said that," Nicholls said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever game plan Tommy Webster came up with, they played to perfection. 
Nobody thought they could play defense, because they had never played it 
before. People have got us bickering back and forth, but that's not the case. 
The trade is done. It's over, and I'm happy for them." 
</P>
<P>
Webster said he's tired of the coast-to-coast verbal exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"He has gone to another hockey club, and the trade was great for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But, (Nicholls) is a good person, and I wish him well." 
</P>

WARRIORS' SECOND CHANCE SINKS CLIPPERS

Terry Teagle scored 30 points and the Golden State Warriors, after blowing an 
18-point first-half lead, used a 30-10 second-half run to beat the Clippers, 
133-120, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who broke a five-game losing streak, set a single-season 
attendance record of 601,000 with their 57th consecutive sellout. Golden State 
has won seven consecutive games over the Clippers at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hardaway added 22 points and 16 assists for the Warriors, though leading 
scorer Chris Mullin had only 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Young scored a career-high 27 points and was the only Clipper to score 
more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State outscored the Clippers, 12-4, in the final two minutes of the 
third quarter to take a 104-92 lead, then started the final quarter with an 
18-6 run. Hardaway's fast-break layup with 8:04 remaining gave the Warriors a 
122-98 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors let their 18-point first-half lead shrivel in the second quarter 
as the Clippers rallied for a 66-66 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
Teagle's 30-point performance off the bench, including 12 of 19 from the field, 
was nothing new to Clipper Coach Don Casey. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been doing that to me ever since he was at Baylor and I was at Temple," 
Casey said. "He can shoot over our smaller lineup. They've got a bucketful of 
shooters over here." 
</P>
<P>
Teagle, the beneficiary on most of Hardaway's 16 assists, helped pick up the 
slack left behind by Mullin's off night. Mullin averages 25.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
"An all-star doesn't have to play well every night," Teagle said. "And Chris is 
definitely an all-star. Sometimes it's up to us to make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
With the game having no bearing on the playoff picture, both teams increased 
playing time for reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to commit a lot of turnovers, and that's when they got us," Young 
said. The Clippers committed 23 turnovers against an effective defensive trap.

FAVORED SIR BEAUFORT DELIVERS IN LA PUENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Once again, Sir Beaufort was well supported in the $82,800 La Puente Stakes 
Wednesday at Santa Anita. He was the 11-10 favorite, marking the seventh time 
in eight career starts that he has been the public choice. Never have the odds 
on the Pleasant Colony colt been longer than 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, Sir Beaufort didn't disappoint his fans. He won for only the 
second time, beating 5-2 second choice Shapiro's Hero by three-quarters of a 
length in 1:49 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for 1 1/8 miles on the turf, the La Puente was moved to 
the main track because of wet weather, and the field was reduced from 13 to 
eight after the scratches of Cove Way, Green's Leader, Short Timer, College 
Green and Predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
In a race devoid of pace, Sir Beaufort and Shapiro's Hero weren't separated by 
more than a half-length for the first six furlongs, but the former was outside, 
which was the place to be Wednesday. The rail was dead all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, trained by Charlie Whittingham, opened up a 1 1/2-length lead at 
the eighth pole, but the margin was being narrowed at the wire by Shapiro's 
Hero and Oh Wow, the 3-1 third choice, who was another half-length back in 
third place. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has had several fast workouts, Sir Beaufort had only an 
eight-length maiden victory to his credit before the La Puente. Otherwise, he 
had finished second at 9-5, 4-5 and 8-5 twice, fourth at 3-2 and fifth at 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
"It never felt like he was trying to run," said Chris McCarron, who has been 
aboard for four of the short-price failures. "I've come to the conclusion that 
when he works in the morning, he's probably going as good as he can go. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just sat there on him in the morning and let him run the last sixteenth 
or so and he's always accelerated real well. In the afternoon, he just has one 
steady lick. There's no real turn of foot, just that steady lick. 
</P>
<P>
"But he got there today. That's the main thing. I was disappointed they took it 
off the grass. He had breezed real well on the turf." 
</P>
<P>
Fresh off an allowance victory on March 31, Shapiro's Hero is his own worst 
enemy, according to Pat Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"If he tries a little bit, he wins," the rider said. "I had to ride him every 
step of the way. He has tons of talent. He's learning every time. I think he 
just needs to learn more. He was unlucky to lose today." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Julio Garcia, the leading apprentice at Santa Anita in 1984, didn't take long 
to find the winner's circle in his return to Southern California. Garcia, whose 
agent is Tony Matos, won with his first mount, 8-1 shot Son of One, in 
Wednesday's second race. Garcia, 24, won a record 321 races in Puerto Rico last 
year and was Mister Frisky's regular rider. . . . Do You Mind, bidding for a 
record-tying sixth victory at Santa Anita, finished third at 4-5 in the third 
race. . . . Gorgeous paid $5.20 to win at Santa Anita for her upset of Bayakoa 
in the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park.

GREAT COMMUNICATOR ON WAY BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great Communicator, the California-based hero of the 1988 Breeders' Cup Turf at 
Churchill Downs, has been out of sight and out of mind since his miserable 
showing last October in the Oak Tree Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
The quirky gelding finished eighth that day, floundering in the propwash thrown 
by Hawkster, who set a world record for 1 1/2 miles on the grass. The Oak Tree 
debacle marked Great Communicator's fourth consecutive loss in a troubling 
downward spiral. Clearly, the old boy had reached the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Or had he? 
</P>
<P>
This week, as the second anniversary of Great Communicator's victory in the San 
Juan Capistrano Handicap approaches Sunday at Santa Anita, trainer and 
part-owner Thad Ackel was delighted to tell the world that his 7-year-old 
campaigner has returned to the track and is being pointed toward a comeback 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The '88 San Juan not only launched Great Communicator as one of North America's 
most popular thoroughbreds, it also provided one of the most emotional moments 
in Santa Anita history. The race came just five days after family patriarch 
George Ackel -- the "great communicator" of New Orleans politics -- died of a 
heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Thad Ackel dedicated the San Juan to his father, and Great Communicator did the 
rest. The former claimer went on to win five more major races in the next 13 
months, boosting his earnings to $2.8 million and amassing a record of such 
consistency that he earned the nickname, "the Great One," with absolutely no 
apologies to Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator's victory in the '88 Breeders' Cup Turf remains his finest 
hour. Taking on the best 1 1/2-mile grass horses from France (Triptych), 
England (Indian Skimmer) and New York (Sunshine Forever), he beat them all at 
12-1 with a memorable front-running performance. 
</P>
<P>
But Great Communicator's decline through the second half of 1989 left a sour 
taste with his many fans. After winning the Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 29, 
the gelding failed in the Golden Gate Handicap, the Arlington Handicap, the 
Arlington Million and then the Oak Tree race. 
</P>
<P>
Ackel spent most of the summer and fall second-guessing himself and tending to 
Great Communicator's growing list of nagging ailments. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I definitely should not have done was run him at Golden Gate," 
Ackel said. "The Hollywood race was harder on him than I thought. I should have 
stopped on him right there and given him two months off. 
</P>
<P>
"But he'd always had a bunch of aches and pains, and he seemed to overcome 
those during his races. I never really worried about him during his morning 
work, because that was just him." 
</P>
<P>
In the subsequent Arlington Million, Great Communicator suffered deep cuts on a 
hind leg. Ackel was relieved to discover that the vital suspensory ligaments 
were spared any damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically thought the cuts were the extent of the injury," he said. "But I 
think when it happened, it actually threw his stride off up front, and he 
wrenched his ankle a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
"After the way he ran in the Oak Tree Invitational, though, I knew without a 
doubt that he needed some time off," Ackel said. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of walking and pampering at Ackel's Hollywood Park stable, 
Great Communicator was sent to Fred Sahadi's Cardiff Stud Farm in Creston, just 
east of Atascadero. The gelding took up temporary residence alongside Flying 
Paster, California's leading sire, and Skywalker, winner of the 1986 Breeders' 
Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ackel, Great Communicator had his own paddock, an acre of lush 
pasture and plenty of attention, despite the fact he was a definite 
non-participant in the breeding season going on around him. 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator's vacation ended in late March when he returned to Hollywood 
Park. He has been galloping for about two weeks now, growing stronger every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"He really needed the rest," Ackel said. "He was getting a little tense, a 
little irritable. Now he's much more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Ackel is not deluding himself about the chances for Great Communicator to reach 
his old heights. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't expect too much, you're never disappointed," the trainer said. 
"Realistically, I'm looking at a 7-year-old horse. He looks great, but he's got 
some wear and tear. Hopefully, the rest repaired all his aches and pains."

ARIZONA STATE, TROJAN MELEE IS 'DEPLORABLE'

<P>
Tommy Adams has hit some big home runs in his 1 1/2 seasons at Arizona State, 
but none was quite as dramatic as the one he hit Saturday in Tempe, Ariz., 
against USC. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' tour of the bases after his seventh-inning homer included an escort by 
an umpire acting as a security guard -- a precaution that became necessary when 
one of college baseball's most competitive rivalries turned ugly. 
</P>
<P>
One inning before Adams' homer, top-ranked Arizona State and No. 6 USC engaged 
in a bloody, bench-clearing brawl that caused a 40-minute delay in the game won 
by Arizona State, 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred before a crowd of 6,809 and a national cable audience and 
was shown on television newscasts throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it was very deplorable, an absolute black eye for college baseball 
and the two schools involved," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten players -- five from each team -- were ejected during the sixth-inning 
melee that erupted when Arizona State pitcher Kip Yaughn threw a fastball 
behind John Jackson's head after the USC center fielder called time out while 
Yaughn was beginning his windup. 
</P>
<P>
Eight campus police units and eight backups from the Tempe Police Dept. were 
called to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"To somebody's credit, nobody (from the crowd) came onto the field," Gillespie 
said. "Had that happened, we really would have had a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Raring, a reserve catcher for USC, sustained a gash on the side of his 
head. Trojan pitcher Randy Powers was spiked on his right hand, outfielder Mike 
Robertson jammed his thumb and catcher Sam Vranjes came away with a bruise 
above his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State pitcher Tony Pena sprained a finger. 
</P>
<P>
When play resumed, both teams were banished to their respective bullpens. Only 
three players and a coach were allowed in the dugout when their team was 
batting. Under NCAA rules, the Arizona State players who were ejected missed 
Tuesday's game against New Mexico State. Ejected players from USC sat out 
Tuesday's game at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 Conference will investigate the incident and decide if further 
suspensions are forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, which has won 21 consecutive games, will meet USC again April 23 
at USC to make up a game that was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
Inspiring performance: Illinois sophomore Bubba Smith says he has always 
admired Angel left-hander Jim Abbott, who made it to the major leagues despite 
being born without a right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, recently gained an even greater appreciation of Abbott's feat 
-- and turned his own season around in the process. 
</P>
<P>
On March 18, Smith was fitted with a cast after breaking his left wrist in a 
collision at first base during a game against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore right-hander from Riverside, the Big Ten Conference player of the 
year last season, was told he would be out at least six weeks. But three days 
later, Smith said he was throwing in the bullpen, shifting a left-hander's 
glove -- "Abbott style" -- from his right hand to his left. 
</P>
<P>
Smith missed 11 games, then came back on April 7 against Minnesota and, with 
the cast still on, pitched five innings to earn a victory. He also beat 
Wisconsin last week, improving his record to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me concentrate a lot more," Smith said of the cast that will not be 
removed for two more weeks. "One of the hardest things was getting used to my 
catcher (former Rubidoux High teammate Sean Mulligan), who throws the ball back 
to the mound as hard as the pitcher throws it to him. I had to bare-hand it a 
couple of times because he was too quick." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he owes a debt to Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought he was a great athlete who did great things for people with 
handicaps," Smith said. "But I'm benefiting, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have gotten to play. I appreciate him finding 
a way to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Hot hitter: Stanford outfielder Jeff Hammonds was one of the most sought-after 
high school players in the nation last year, but even he could not foresee the 
impact he would have during his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected some kind of success, but not to this magnitude," said Hammonds, 
who has a 36-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Hammonds broke the Pacific 10 record for hits in consecutive games 
-- 31 -- set last season by Jeff Brauning of Oregon State. Former Oklahoma 
State third baseman Robin Ventura set the NCAA record in 1987 when he hit in 58 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Hammonds leads the Pac-10 with 31 stolen bases and is second in batting with a 
.386 average. 
</P>
<P>
Middaugh update: District Judge George Alexander last week ordered dropped an 
embezzlement charge against former Michigan coach Bud Middaugh. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant prosecutor Lynwood Noah had tried to prove that Middaugh illegally 
gave money from the sale of football programs to a high school booster club and 
a former Michigan baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
"I am glad this nightmare is finally over," Middaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Big Ten hit Michigan's baseball program with two years' 
probation, citing more than 40 violations of league and NCAA rules from 1983 to 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Middaugh, 51, resigned in July during the investigation after 10 years at 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
College Baseball Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander James Popoff is 6-3 with a 3.24 earned-run average for 
Cal State Fullerton, which moved into first place in the Big West Conference 
with a three-game sweep of Fresno State last weekend. Fresno State had not been 
swept since 1986. . . . Tony Kounas of Loyola Marymount hit three home runs in 
one game last week against University of San Francisco. Kounas, a transfer from 
Oklahoma State, has 14 homers and leads the West Coast Conference with 53 runs 
batted in. Loyola is in first place in the WCC and ranked 10th by Baseball 
America. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara infielder Jeff Antoon is batting .368 with a team-high seven 
home runs and 40 RBIs. . . . Cal State Long Beach outfielder Todd Guggiana has 
a 22-game hitting streak. . . . UC Irvine right-hander Ken Whitworth is 9-3 and 
has 75 strikeouts -- nine more than he had in the past three seasons combined. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State outfielder Jim Austin, a sophomore from Santa Ana Mater Dei High, 
had four home runs, a triple and six RBIs last weekend against USC. Sun Devil 
left-hander Sean Rees is 10-0 with a 2.15 ERA and leads the nation with 138 
strikeouts in 104 2/3 innings. . . . Washington State Coach Bobo Brayton won 
his 1,000th game last week against Eastern Washington, only the fourth active 
NCAA Division I coach to reach that plateau. Brayton, in his 29th season with 
the Cougars, joins Ron Fraser of Miami, Cliff Gustafson of Texas and Al 
Ogletree of Pan American in the 1,000 club. . . . Freshman right-hander Pat 
Leahy, grandson of former Notre Dame football coach Frank Leahy, is 4-0 with a 
1.70 ERA for the Fighting Irish.

<P>
DISCRIMINATION: CITY STAFF WILL TRY TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS RELATED TO RACIAL BIAS 
ALLEGATIONS MADE BY TENANTS OF THE LOW-INCOME KING'S VILLAGES.

<P>
The Board of Directors has launched an investigation into tenants' allegations 
of racial discrimination at King's Villages housing project in Northwest 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The board on Tuesday ordered city staff members to obtain records belonging to 
the project owner, Goldrich, Kest &amp; Associates, and managing partner, 
Thomas Pottmeyer &amp; Co., to determine if racial discrimination has occurred 
at the low-income housing project. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board ordered city staff members to secure records from the 
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which annually inspects 
the project for compliance under the federal Section 8, low-income rental 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised not to discriminate," City Director Rick Cole said of the King's 
Villages owners. "We've been told by people coming down here that there is 
discrimination. I'd like to get to the bottom of this." 
</P>
<P>
The discrimination complaints come from members of the King's Villages Tenants 
Union Organization. De-Vera Joe, the group's president, claims that since 
Pottmeyer took over management in 1988, not one black tenant has been admitted 
to the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pottmeyer has filled vacancies at the complex with Latinos who do not 
speak English, Joe said. These new, non-English speaking tenants are subjected 
to higher rents, harassment and intimidation by the management, she claimed. 
</P>

"The complex has gone almost 50% Hispanic in one year," Joe said. "That's what 
we're telling the board: They're discriminating." 
</P>
<P>
However, Thomas Pottmeyer on Wednesday denied Joe's allegations, saying that 
both blacks and Latinos have been admitted to the project under his management. 
About 25% of the 313-unit project's tenants are Latino, he said, a change from 
the past when virtually all of the residents were black. He denied that Latinos 
pay higher rents or are harassed, saying that he has followed HUD regulations 
concerning waiting lists and the setting of rents. 
</P>
<P>
"They regularly audit everything we do," Pottmeyer said of HUD. "One of the 
things they audit is whether we are following nondiscriminatory practices. . . 
. The city is not going to find anything on this (alleged) discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Pottmeyer said city officials have not yet contacted him about the 
investigation. He said his firm will not turn over any records to the city 
unless he receives HUD permission to do so. 
</P>
<P>
For months, tenant union members have been trying to obtain records in hopes of 
substantiating their claims. They appealed to the Board of Directors for action 
after they were refused tenant waiting lists and rental payment information 
from Pottmeyer, Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
Although housing discrimination complaints are normally investigated and 
prosecuted under state and federal laws, City Manager Donald McIntyre told the 
board Tuesday that the city has some authority to investigate King's Villages. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the city took possession of the project in 1982, after HUD 
foreclosed on the property. Later that year, the city sold the project to 
Goldrich, Kest, a Culver City-based company with 10,000 HUD projects in 
California. A city-company agreement prohibited Goldrich, Kest from 
discriminating in renting the units. It also gave the city the right to review 
rental records and other documents, McIntyre reported. 
</P>
<P>
City officials offered no specific plans for action if the investigation turns 
up evidence of discrimination, but Cole suggested it might be cause for the 
city to take the property back from Goldrich, Kest. 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned, 26-acre housing project on Fair Oaks Avenue has been the 
object of tenant complaints of poor maintenance for most of the past year. The 
complaints prompted the board in February to order a $20,000 unit-by-unit 
inspection for compliance with city building, health and fire codes. The 
results are being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants also complained about what they claimed was bullying behavior by 
security guards at the complex. Their allegations were given more attention 
after a confrontation with security guards on Jan. 18 resulted in the death of 
28-year-old Robert Earl Holloway.

THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police officials on Saturday will begin handing out bright yellow stickers as 
part of a new auto-theft prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia vehicle owners may sign up for the city's MAD-CAT (Monrovia Auto Theft 
Detail-Combat Auto Theft) program between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday and 
Sunday in the city parking lot across from the police station on Lime Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Participating owners will sign consent forms that authorize police to stop 
their cars if they are spotted on the road between 1 and 5 a.m. Decals will be 
placed in the rear window of participating vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Lakewood substation initiated a 
similar program late last year, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. Police departments 
in San Diego, Redlands, Upland, Ontario and Chino also have such programs, 
Monrovia Police Sgt. Richard Lukofnak II said. "(Thieves) don't steal these 
cars, but they take the ones around it," he said.

BUILDING MORATORIUM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An urgency ordinance to temporarily stop "mansionization," the replacement of 
single-story homes by larger multistory homes, was introduced Tuesday by the 
Pasadena Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, no building permits will be issued for single-family homes 
taller than 27 feet or for second-story construction that exceeds 50% of the 
square footage of the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
While the ordinance is in place, city staff members will complete a zoning 
study to determine how to stop the loss of smaller homes. 
</P>
<P>
City Director Bill Paparian cast the sole vote against the measure, saying the 
approach was too broad. City Director Rick Cole abstained. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was drafted after residents from the Madison Heights, Lower 
Hastings Ranch and Oakdale neighborhood associations complained that small 
homes were disappearing as developers tear them down to build larger 
residences.

TWINS HOPE TO CASH IN ON AMBASSADOR PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They were told it would be impossible for two teen-agers to raise $8,000 in 
three months. But, with a little hope and a lot of help from friends, the 
16-year-old La Puente twins are almost there. 
</P>
<P>
Joann and Talolo Lepale, juniors at Bassett High School, were chosen in January 
to participate this summer in the People to People High School Student 
Ambassador Program. People to People is a nonprofit organization that takes 
selected students from around the United States on learning trips to different 
parts of the world. Students are chosen on the basis of academic achievement, 
community involvement and recommendations from teachers and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The students chosen must pay their own way; People to People had set an April 1 
deadline for the fee of $4,000 per student. That meant $8,000 for the Lepale 
twins, whose mother is a hospital worker and father is a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
The twins, their parents and little sister collected cans and newspapers. They 
held a carwash and a yard sale. And they sent out 110 letters to clubs and 
organizations in the San Gabriel Valley asking for donations. 
</P>
<P>
Donations and pledges came from neighbors, local doctors, pharmacists and shop 
owners, friends and co-workers. The largest donation came from the American 
Legion, with the help of Tom Golden of the Monterey Park American Legion Post. 
Golden had heard about the twins' fund-raising efforts and started collecting 
money from the other 30 American Legion posts in the San Gabriel Valley. The 
Legionnaires donated $1,620, Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the twins have their passports ready, the fund-raising isn't over yet. 
Their mother, Yonneta Lepale, said some of the pledges are still not definite, 
and the twins will need spending money. The Lepales have sent half the money; 
People to People has extended the fee deadline for the twins to May 10. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the family is planning another carwash and yard sale. ELENA

20 PROTEST PROPOSAL FOR NEW TERMINAL AT BURBANK AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noise protesters sharply attacked a proposal for a new terminal at Burbank 
Airport, calling it part of a plan to expand commercial air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 protesters turned out Monday for a rare night meeting of the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Residents east of the airport are "very upset" about recent increases in the 
number of flights and the prospect of still more, said Kurt Hunter, president 
of the North Hollywood Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed sites for the new terminal include the airport's northeast corner and 
a split-terminal plan under which automobile parking and ticket-selling 
operations would be in a building in the southwest corner. Passengers would 
travel underground to board waiting airliners from a structure in the northwest 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has been pressuring airport administrators 
for years to construct a new terminal because the present structure, built more 
than 50 years ago, is closer to runways than modern safety regulations allow. 
</P>
<P>
The terminal is expected to cost $200 million to $250 million. Authority 
members two weeks ago unanimously awarded an 18-month, $790,000 contract to 
KPMG Peat Marwick Airport Consulting Services to prepare an environmental 
impact report on the sites. 
</P>
<P>
The northeast site, which most authority members appear to prefer, was studied 
in 1984 but dropped at the insistence of the Pentagon in 1985 because it was 
too close to Lockheed Corp.'s super-secret "skunk works," where advanced 
military planes are designed. 
</P>
<P>
The site, staunchly opposed by anti-noise protesters, was revived as a 
possibility last year after Lockheed's announcement that the land was for sale 
and the company's operations are moving. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners organized to fight airport noise are banking on the split-terminal 
plan as a first step toward routing some flights to the east on takeoff, 
instead of over Los Angeles neighborhoods to the south and west, including 
Studio City and North Hollywood. The airport is owned by communities to the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, studied in 1987, a people-mover would carry passengers under 
the east-west runway between the parking and ticket-selling area and the 
airport's northwest sector, where planes would park. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the "share the noise" plan note that, if airliners are parked on 
the east side of the airport -- as would be required if the new terminal is 
built on the Lockheed property -- pilots would be forced to taxi across the 
north-south runway to take off to the east. They fear that pilots would refuse 
to cross the runway for safety reasons, effectively preventing eastbound 
takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Eastbound takeoffs have been banned by the FAA for the past three years because 
the east-west runway is closer to the terminal than the north-south runway. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials say that, in addition to the two previously studied sites, 
Peat Marwick consultants are expected to study other configurations. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility is placing parking and ticket-selling facilities in the 
northeast part of the airport and a passenger boarding area in the northwest 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Paterson, president of Valley Village Homeowners Assn. in North Hollywood, 
has written to the Los Angeles and Burbank city councils, asking them to sue to 
prevent construction of a new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Paterson, whose letter was sent on behalf of 11 homeowner and anti-noise 
organizations, also asked that the suit try to halt the flights that Southwest 
Airlines began from the airport Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy," he wrote, "is to pack the airport with more flights and 
passengers to cost-justify . . . a $250-million replacement terminal project." 
</P>
<P>
The airport's passenger total has dropped sharply in recent years, plummeting 
from a peak of 3.2 million in 1987 to 2.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest spokesmen say they hope to bring 350,000 additional passengers each 
year to the Burbank facility.

MUIR HIGH'S INGER MILLER: ROSE PRINCESS AND QUEEN OF SPRINTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: THIS OUTSTANDING SCHOLAR-ATHLETE HAS THE FASTEST TIMES IN THE NATION IN 
THE 100- AND 200-METER DASHES. AND SHE DID IT WITHOUT HER USUAL OFF-SEASON 
TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sprinter Inger Miller's senior year at Muir High in Pasadena has already been 
one of crowning accomplishment -- and not just on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the school year, the attractive 17-year-old fulfilled one dream by 
serving as a princess in the Tournament of Roses court. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has been wearing a more familiar crown as the reigning sprint 
queen of high school track. 
</P>
<P>
In her first two seasons on the Muir varsity, Miller tended to be overshadowed 
by Rio Mesa's Angela Burnham, who has since moved on to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
But the spotlight has focused on Miller this season, and she has made the most 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
She has produced the fastest times in the nation in both the 100- and 200-meter 
dashes. She has run the 100 in 11.48 seconds and the 200 in 23.57 seconds and 
also anchors Muir's 400-meter relay team that has a national best of 46.07 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
What makes those numbers even more impressive is that she missed her usual 
off-season training regimen in order to participate in her Tournament of Roses 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as a princess, she said, consumed much of her time from early in the 
school year in September through the start of January. But for Miller it was 
more than worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We got so many things besides the clothes and the other fringe benefits you 
usually get for being a princess," she said. "We got the chance to meet so many 
people. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I had a really great time and 
all seven of us (princesses and queen) are all still friends." 
</P>
<P>
When she first entered the contest, Miller didn't hold high hopes of being 
named one of the princesses. She said going out for the Tournament of Roses 
court is one of the rights of passage for high school seniors in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a tradition," she said. "I know everyone in Pasadena always 
wanted to go out when they were a senior. So I just decided to go out for it. 
But I didn't expect to win or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, with more than 750 candidates participating, Miller realized the 
numbers were stacked against her. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 763 girls that tried out and they pick only seven from that so 
what's that? About one percent? Everyone tries out but not everyone expects to 
win. But as it turned out I made it." 
</P>
<P>
From the time she was selected last October through the Tournament of Roses 
Parade in January, Miller said she had little time to think about track and 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"We had luncheons, dinners and other functions and benefits to attend and we 
went to visit places like the City of Hope," she said. "We did so many things 
before the parade even took place. The parade just topped it off." 
</P>
<P>
Even after the parade, Miller still attends Tournament of Roses functions as 
her time permits. She said she was also required to take a speech class at 
Pasadena City College, for which she will receive three units of college 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, it has been back to track since early January. Miller 
said people were concerned that the layoff from track might slow her 
development as a senior only that hasn't materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"People always ask me if it has affected my track performance and I'm actually 
doing better than I was last year at this time so I guess that answers that 
question," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brownfield, girls track coach at Muir, says Miller has been all business 
since her return. 
</P>
<P>
"She actually came out of the Tournament of Roses thing very good," he said. 
"She never got the big head that some girls get and she came right back into 
her workouts well. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never really know what a solid weight training and hill climbing program 
(in the off-season) would have done for her. But we do know that she got 
through with her obligations and went right into running." 
</P>
<P>
Not that it wasn't difficult for Miller at first. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like the beginning of the season after summer and I just had to do 
a lot of workouts condensed together," she said. "I just did a lot of workouts 
all rolled into one instead of spreading them out." 
</P>
<P>
Going into this season the 100 meters has been considered her best event but 
Miller has been happy with her progress in the 200 meters this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I have four events that I have to focus on and right now I don't think I'm 
stronger in any one event," she said. "But right now I feel stronger in the 
200. I feel more confident with it than I have before. I won't say it's my 
strongest event but I feel it's more on a par with my 100 than before." 
</P>
<P>
Miller gives much of the credit to her coach from outside of school, Leo Davis, 
who has worked with numerous Olympic track stars in the past. Included on that 
list is Miller's father, Lennox, a sprinter for Jamaica in the 1968 Summer 
Olympics and at USC. He is now a dentist in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"He's (Davis) worked with a lot of people and he's helped me a lot this season 
and in the off-season with many events," she said. "He's like an uncle to me. 
I've known him for so long. That's why I call him, 'Uncle Leo." 
</P>
<P>
She said Davis started working with her in earnest this season although he has 
always been available throughout her career to offer tips on training and 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said she also receives occasional help from her father and relays and 
team matters are handled by Brownfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father helps her a lot with the mental training and other aspects," 
Brownfield said. "Leo helps her with the interval training. We work with her on 
the relays and team things. It's like coaching by committee but, you know, 
whatever works." 
</P>
<P>
Having more than one coach could be bothersome to many athletes but Miller 
doesn't seem to mind. "It may not work for everybody but it's sure working for 
me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that has gotten in the way of her progress this season has been 
a sprained left ankle that she suffered in between races at the Arcadia 
Invitational about two weeks ago. That forced her to miss the Mt. Carmel 
Invitational in San Diego last week. 
</P>
<P>
Miller thinks that she injured the ankle stepping into a hole in the infield 
during the meet but didn't realize the severity of the injury at first. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know when it happened," she said. "It was sometime between the 
200 and the mile relay. I didn't really feel it until I woke up the Sunday 
morning after the meet." 
</P>
<P>
Since then she has been undergoing therapy. She also is keeping her legs strong 
by running in the Muir pool. Miller is hoping that she will be able to compete 
in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays on Saturday in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Brownfield said Miller will probably compete in the 100 meters and two relay 
events at the meet if she is healthy but it is a day-to-day proposition at the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Another distraction for Miller could have been her selection of a college she 
will attend in the fall. But she says it was never much of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I decided where I wanted to go it was a big relief," she said. "But I 
don't think I was ever that distracted by it, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Although Miller has already decided what college she will attend, she will not 
make the decision public until a press conference Friday night at her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my four visits in and I decided where I want to go but I just haven't 
announced it yet," she says. 
</P>
<P>
An outstanding student with a 3.6 grade-point average, Miller has taken 
recruiting trips to UC Berkeley, Brown, Texas and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that her father graduated from USC, and that she has been spotted 
on the Muir campus wearing her father's old letterman jacket, the Trojans are 
the obvious favorite. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said the choice is her decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say that (there is pressure) but it's my decision to go 
where I want to go," Miller said. "I've weighed everything and I think I know 
what's best for me." 
</P>
<P>
With the announcement of her college plans, Miller said, it will fulfill just 
about all of her goals for this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best year I've had (in high school)," she said. "It has gone by so 
fast. I can't believe that it's almost over. I had some goals and basically 
everything that I wanted I've accomplished. I became a princess and I've 
decided what college I'm going to." 
</P>
<P>
Miller can put the finishing touch on her career by winning a state title in 
the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the only crowns that have eluded her in high school but, as the state 
meet approaches in early June, it appears that those titles are finally within 
reach.

ON THE JOB FIRING PEOPLE;

<P>
HE GIVES THE HEAVE-HO; 
</P>
<P>
BILL SOUZA HAS SEEN IT ALL, FROM TEARS TO A POINTED GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY ARMSTRONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Souza was fired from three jobs early in his career. But his real training 
in dismissal came when he began sitting on the other side of the desk. 
</P>
<P>
As a personnel boss for several large corporations, he has fired more than 
1,500 employees. In the process, he said, he has encountered just about every 
response a person can have at hearing the news: shock, tears, anger, a gun 
pointed at his face and a few lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as president of Network Personnel, a Ventura consulting company, Souza 
passes along his experience to litigation-wary employers looking for a safe way 
to give people their walking papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect anyone to walk away from here feeling warm and fuzzy about 
firing people," Souza recently told a group of 20 Ventura County employers in a 
three-hour seminar in Oxnard. "But you will have a better idea of how to 
protect yourself legally." 
</P>
<P>
The volume of court cases suggests that employers have reason to weigh how they 
give someone the ax. Workers file more than 1,000 wrongful-discharge suits a 
year in California. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, Souza told the group as he held up a newspaper article, a 
Ventura County jury awarded $231,000 to an Oxnard man who had been fired from 
his job of 23 years for taking $5 worth of copper pipe for his personal use. 
The jury agreed with the man's lawyers that the firing had been unjust. 
</P>
<P>
But Souza said encouragingly, "It's a myth that you can't fire someone without 
a reason. The reality is you can fire anyone, any time, for no reason." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he said, some sackings are easier than others. "I've terminated 
people because they had a conflict with co-workers and couldn't get along. But 
that's tough to quantify. How do you quantify that someone is a nerd?" 
</P>
<P>
A woman personnel manager raised her hand. "What if they say they're sick? That 
happens all the time. You can't fire someone for being sick." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you can," Souza shot back. "You can fire someone for having cancer who 
can't perform the job. I'm not advocating it. But you can say, 'It's impacting 
on your work performance.' " 
</P>
<P>
Souza said he wasn't trying to create sack-happy terminators. He urged his 
pupils to consider mitigating circumstances, use progressive disciplinary 
actions and performance reviews and, when a decision had been reached to 
discharge an employee, to convey that information in an honest, straightforward 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases, it is less expensive to salvage an employee than terminate 
him," he said, pausing for a moment. "But it is also much more expensive to 
keep a failure than to fire him." 
</P>
<P>
He endorsed putting so-called "at-will" language on job applications and 
company handbooks declaring that the company may fire a worker any time for any 
reason. However, some attorneys familiar with wrongful-discharge cases say it 
isn't always that simple. 
</P>
<P>
Employers are always bound by laws against discrimination on the basis of sex, 
race, age or religion. And saying later that workers won't be fired without 
having a chance to shape up may cause a court to "take the position that the 
at-will language was modified by subsequent behavior," said Harris E. Kershnar, 
a Tustin attorney who has represented more than 100 plaintiffs in 
wrongful-termination suits.

AFIELD WITH JERRY SCHAD: ENJOYING THE GREAT OUTDOORS IN NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SCHAD, Editor's note: Jerry Schad's name is synonymous with the 
outdoors. His book Afoot and Afield in San Diego County has been as common an 
item in San Diego backpacks as a canteen of water. Schad, assistant professor 
of physical science at San Diego Mesa College, also wrote Backcountry Roads 
&amp; Trails, San Diego County, and Cycling San Diego County along with several 
other outdoors books on Southern California. North County Focus is pleased to 
introduce him as a monthly columnist writing about the many recreational 
opportunities in the area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greetings! In this inaugural column, I'd like to introduce myself and preview a 
few of the places and topics I'll be sharing with you in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with many of you, San Diego County is my adopted, rather than 
native, home. I'm a solid Californian, though, descended from ancestors who 
settled in Northern California during the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago I emigrated from the Bay Area to pursue a master's degree in 
astronomy. On arriving, I must confess, I wasn't too impressed with the sere 
and somewhat forbidding aspect of the then-more-plentiful open spaces around 
San Diego. But I did appreciate the bright, sunny weather, and I resolved to 
get to know the area at least a little before my return up north. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, I remember one particular experience in April, 1972: I was 
working my way up a narrow, dry canyon under the blazing desert sun. As I swung 
around a bend, an astounding sight was revealed to me. Dozens of palms stood 
shoulder to shoulder, their crowns glowing lime-green against the brown-baked 
canyon walls. In the grove itself, under the whispering fronds, a small stream 
hurried downward toward oblivion on the glaring, boulder-tossed wash below. 
Birds chattered and darted about under cover of the shade, safe from the 
desiccating heat outside. 
</P>
<P>
To me it was as if all the diverse elements of the world -- sun and shade, hot 
and cool, wet and dry, life and lifelessness -- were seamlessly integrated and 
compressed into one very compact whole. 
</P>
<P>
That small (but remarkable, to me) experience was a pivotal juncture in my 
life. The strange, green oasis tucked into Anza-Borrego's parched mountains 
hinted at other wonders I supposed would lie farther up the canyon and farther 
afield. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a close look at a county map only whetted my appetite further. More than 
one-third of the county's land area, I discovered, was blanketed in green tint, 
the color indicating public lands open to recreation. What secrets did the 
Anza-Borrego Desert State Park's half-million acres hold? What was the view 
like from the 6,512-foot summit of Cuyamaca Peak? What mysteries were concealed 
in the back corners of the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to the coast but outside most of the green areas on the map, I noticed a 
network of fine, squiggly lines suggesting, perhaps, many miles of fine bicycle 
touring routes. I was beginning to realize there was a lot to explore between 
the sandy beaches and the desert sands of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Since those early days, I've never really had time to think about living 
elsewhere, let alone wanting to. For 17 years now, I've been photographing and 
writing about San Diego county's scenic and recreational areas, and sharing 
much of what I discovered in guidebooks and articles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the vast open spaces that once existed beyond San Diego's core area have 
been nibbled down considerably by urban development. Many of the once-tranquil 
byways I used to tour on skinny tires have become roaring thoroughfares 
carrying harried commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, of late there also has been a greater concern for preservation of open 
space on the part of local governments and more funding for the purchase of 
parkland. Overall, the majority of the county's most beautiful places remain 
intact and substantially unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County, and especially North County, remains a great place to live, 
blessed with a climate permitting year-round outdoor recreation and plenty of 
opportunity for quick escapes. 
</P>
<P>
In future columns, I'll be exploring with you the best of North County's 
natural landscapes -- from the shores of the Pacific Ocean to the Borrego 
Badlands. You'll learn how to beat the heat on a summer's day and where to seek 
the warm sunshine in the dead of winter. We'll explore the flowering chaparral 
in spring and crunch through crispy leaf litter under the autumn oaks of 
Palomar and Cuyamaca. If next winter's rains cooperate, you'll be treated to 
some inside information about North County's best waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Walks described in this column will range from half-hour strolls to half-day 
hikes. But we won't limit ourselves to walking trips. Winding backcountry roads 
still exist in North County; you'll learn where to tour some smooth ones on 
your 10-speed and where to tackle the bumpy ones on your mountain bike. You'll 
learn how, when and where to take advantage of opportunities for cross-country 
skiing right in our local mountains. You'll find out how to take advantage of 
the county's blackest skies for viewing the Milky Way. And you'll be kept 
apprised of the latest park and open-space acquisitions, and the newest trails. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to North County's outdoors column. Look for it on the third Thursday of 
each month.

'FAMILY AUDIENCE THEATER' FILLS VOID IN NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARD GARZA, SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any conversation about theater in San Diego invariably includes references to 
The Big Three: the Old Globe, the La Jolla Playhouse and the San Diego 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the other three Equity houses in town: Starlight Musical, the 
Gaslamp and the Bowery theaters, not to mention many other professional 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with this surfeit of efforts, there has been a huge void in a particular 
area of the local stage scene. As far as Bonnie Tarwater is concerned, the void 
is now being filled. 
</P>
<P>
Tarwater is the president and artistic director of the Del Mar Theatre 
Ensemble, which since last September has been producing "family audience 
theater." That's Tarwater's preferred term for "children's theater," a phrase 
that she feels encumbers her. 
</P>
<P>
"When people hear 'children's theater,' they think three things: that it's 
performed by child actors; that it's aimed at toddlers; and that it's 
unprofessional. That's all untrue," Tarwater said, in a recent interview at Del 
Mar Plaza, where the company is housed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very sophisticated theater that people of all ages can enjoy together. 
It's the kind of live community experience that's lacking in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is aimed primarily at young audiences, and it's the kind of theater 
that hasn't been produced regularly in San Diego, despite the city's national 
reputation for quality stage work. Part of the reason is that professional 
children's theater is just as expensive to produce as professional theater 
aimed at any audience. And, even though children are frequently referred to as 
the "arts audiences of the future," children's theater is somehow considered a 
greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can make a go of children's theater here, it's probably energetic, 
enthusiastic Tarwater, who has the kind of zeal required for someone running a 
fledgling nonprofit arts organization. She certainly has the credentials for 
this effort. 
</P>
<P>
Tarwater is a professionally trained actress who attended UC San Diego and 
received her master's degree from the American Conservatory Theatre in San 
Francisco. She worked in a number of regional theaters, including ACT, the New 
York Shakespeare Festival and the Pacific Conservatory for Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
She gave up her acting career when she moved to San Diego County with her 
physician husband seven years ago. Since then she has gained other valuable 
training for her current endeavor -- she's the mother of two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
"After I had my kids and started looking for activities, it became painfully 
obvious that there wasn't much here for children," Tarwater said. "This enables 
me to work in theater again, and it involves my family." 
</P>
<P>
It is somewhat ironic that Tarwater's endeavor has ended up in Del Mar Plaza. 
She was part of the vociferous opposition to the plaza's development, fearing 
Del Mar would lose its small-town character. But Del Mar voters approved the 
plaza, so Tarwater decided to take advantage of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the developers and told them up front that I was against them and 
asked them to put their money where their mouth is," Tarwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The developers, David Winkler and Ivan Gayler, responded by providing a space 
for the theater -- free -- until the space is rented. And Tarwater says they'll 
help find another space should that occur. Tarwater says it's a fair deal, 
saying a new theater company couldn't make it any other way. And the developers 
have been impressed enough with the company's initial efforts that they've 
contracted for four productions -- up to $30,000 in cash and services -- in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's most recent show, "Telling Wilde Tales," was an adaptation of 
fairy tales by Oscar Wilde -- the kind of challenging, but entertaining fare 
Tarwater wants to produce. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned about doing a piece that includes themes such as love, death 
and jealousy," she says. "We weren't sure what the reaction would be, but it's 
been great. Parents wish their children weren't old enough to deal with life 
issues, but it's often the parents who don't want to face them." 
</P>
<P>
The company's initial production was "You're a Good Man Charlie Brown." They 
followed with "Peter and the Wolf" and a holiday program that included both 
Christmas and Hanukkah stories. 
</P>
<P>
Their next production will be Moliere's "Scapan -- A Family Farce," opening May 
20.

ABDUCTED BOY BARTERS CALMLY FOR HIS RELEASE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ARMED WOMAN PULLED THE 9-YEAR-OLD OFF SCHOOL PLAYGROUND.

<P>
A 9-year-old boy was grabbed from a school playground by a woman armed with a 
gun and held hostage for about 20 minutes Wednesday before he calmly negotiated 
his own release, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Sheila Faye Reed, 30, of Yorba Linda, who allegedly walked onto 
the grounds of Van Buren Elementary School and abducted David Christie as he 
played catch with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
School officials acted quickly to corral the other children to another part of 
the school, and police negotiators tried to talk her into giving up the boy. 
But finally, it was the words of her young captive that brought the drama to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her at the end if she would let me go, I'd tell the (policeman) to put 
down his weapon, and so she did," David recounted in an interview at his home 
several hours after the incident. "I did it because I just didn't want to be 
there. I wanted to get out." 
</P>
<P>
The officer put down his gun, and David ran into the arms of police, Placentia 
Police Lt. Daryll Thomann said. The boy's composure, say those involved in the 
matter, helped keep the situation from turning into a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy was pretty cool throughout the whole ordeal," Thomann said. "He was 
the negotiator." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who works part time at Disneyland, was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping 
and was being held at Orange County Jail on Wednesday, police said. She was 
armed with a loaded .22-caliber semiautomatic, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman allegedly abducted David about 12:15 p.m., just as the lunch period 
was ending, Principal Kenneth Lorge said. David and a friend were tossing a 
baseball back and forth on their way to class when, "the lady grabbed me by the 
hand," David said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'We're gonna go home now,' and I said, 'No, no, no!' but I didn't 
scream," David said, recalling his afternoon's adventure as a couple of 
wide-eyed neighborhood children listened in rapt attention. "Then my principal 
came and he told everybody to go somewhere, and then the police came." 
</P>
<P>
David said he decided not to try to fight the woman or run from her. 
</P>
<P>
"Because if I tried to grab the gun, she probably had a good grip on the gun 
and probably she would shoot me. So I didn't want that to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed apparently dragged the third-grader to a bench at Carlsbad Park, which is 
next to the school. A school supervisor spotted them and asked the woman what 
she was doing. Someone ran to tell the principal, and someone else called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her why she took me, and she said because she needed help for 
something," David said. "She didn't say for what. I felt nervous and scared." 
</P>
<P>
Reed communicated with police through the boy, Thomann said, having him yell 
information to the officers instead of talking to them directly. 
</P>
<P>
"She told one policeman, 'Put down your weapon and come here,' " David said. 
"And the police said, 'We're not allowed to do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's when David said it dawned on him to suggest a swap -- his safe return if 
the officer put his gun down. Reed agreed and David was released. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, Thomann said, police talked her into throwing down her 
weapon. She tried to flee, he said, but officers tackled and handcuffed her. 
</P>
<P>
When school officials called David's mother, Gretchen, at home, she said she 
insisted that they tell her what was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"They said: 'Get somebody to drive you here. Your son's been held hostage,' " 
she said, her eyes misting as she told the story. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real proud of him. Everybody said he was real brave," she said. "All 
reports I got about him were real good." 
</P>
<P>
David said he will never know why she chose to take him, other than perhaps 
because he was closest to her on the playground. But, he said, he will remember

HOSTAGE: Ex-hostage David Jacobsen is optimistic about reports (A1) from Beirut 
that a U.S. captive there could be released this weekend. . . . "The fact they 
asked for John Kelly is significant," said Jacobsen, who now lives in 
Huntington Beach. Kelly was the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon when Jacobsen was 
released in November, 1986, after 17 months of captivity. . . . Also, this is 
the holy month of Ramadan, he noted, a time when Islamic countries often grant 
amnesty to prisoners. David Reyes and Mark I. Pinsky

LOW POWER: Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network, which operates KTBN-TV 
Channel 40, is one of the largest owners of low-power television stations in 
the nation (A1). Last year, Trinity added nearly one new outlet a week to its 
total of more than 100. But at least half a dozen attempts by various other 
groups to build such "mini-stations" in Orange County have failed, including at 
least one in Santa Ana by the National Black Media Coalition. David Reyes and

STANTON M.D. CHARGED IN DRUG SELLING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Criminal charges were filed against a Stanton physician on Wednesday, alleging 
that his medical practice was little more than a front for selling prescription 
drugs to addicts, including a mother and daughter who overdosed within two days 
of each other. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office charged Dr. Lowell Orgill Kirk, 
59, with 14 felony counts of illegally selling sedatives and pain relievers 
although the buyers were not under his care nor required medication for any 
health problem. 
</P>
<P>
Four charges relate to Susan Gunn and her mother, Elsie, both of Garden Grove, 
who overdosed in April, 1989, on a variety of drugs, including codeine, 
morphine and Valium, some of which were allegedly purchased from Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's reports show that Elsie Gunn, 60, died April 24, 1989, from massive 
internal bleeding caused by the combined effects of at least 10 drugs in her 
system. Authorities said Susan Gunn, 34, overdosed the next day on six 
different prescription drugs but recovered in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe he is no different than any drug dealer on the street," said 
Special Agent Andy Alonso of the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement in Santa 
Ana, which investigated the case. "Maybe he's even more dangerous by selling 
pure drugs that are very addictive and harder to kick." 
</P>
<P>
In connection with the Kirk case, prosecutors said they are also preparing 
charges against John Movsesian, 58, a pharmacist who shut down his operation 
last year at Kirk's Crescent Medical Group on Western Avenue. Movsesian, who 
could not be reached for comment, could face misdemeanor counts of illegally 
supplying prescription drugs to Kirk's patients. 
</P>
<P>
Although Elsie Gunn obtained her drugs from Kirk, prosecutors declined to file 
a manslaughter charge against the doctor because it could not be shown that he 
gave Gunn the lethal dose. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a causation problem," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Connie Ferris Johnson, 
the prosecutor. "The drugs she took were linked to him, but you have an 
independent party other than Kirk administering them." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor is scheduled to surrender Friday in Municipal Court in Westminster. 
If convicted, he would face a maximum penalty of three years in prison on each 
count of illegally supplying prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, who has been practicing medicine in Orange County for 30 years, could not 
be reached for comment Wednesday. But in earlier interviews with The Times, he 
repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, although he acknowledged that he has made 
some "mistakes" in prescribing drugs to certain patients. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick L. McBride, Kirk's attorney, declined to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement began an undercover investigation of Kirk 
in July, 1988, when an Orange County Sheriff's Department informant told agents 
that prescription drugs could be easily obtained at the doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, undercover operatives and state agents said, they made repeated 
purchases of sedatives, sleeping pills, depressants and painkillers from Kirk 
without proper medical examinations nor the health problems that would require 
the drugs they bought. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said they found evidence showing that Kirk improperly 
prescribed diuretics, which increase the flow of urine, to a 30-year-old 
anorexic woman. Physicians say diuretics can cause even further weight loss in 
anorexic people and endanger their health. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been doing this for a very long time," said state Special Agent Spring 
Robbins, who is assigned to the case. The California Medical Board, formerly 
called the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance, "has had numerous 
complaints about him over a period of years," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first time, however, that Kirk has been charged with a crime 
after 11 years of inquiries by state and federal authorities into allegations 
of insurance fraud and illegally prescribing controlled substances. 
</P>
<P>
State narcotics agents said Kirk was first suspected of illegally distributing 
prescription drugs in 1979, when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
looked into whether he was selling methaqualone, a sedative to treat insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the California Medical Board, an agency that monitors the 
professional conduct of physicians, investigated charges that Kirk was 
illegally prescribing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
New suspicions were involved in February, 1988, when 18 federal and state 
investigators wearing bulletproof vests stormed into Kirk's medical clinic and 
seized his files. Kirk's practice was one of 24 searched that month by a task 
force looking into allegations that diagnostic laboratories were fraudulently 
charging insurance companies millions of dollars for unnecessary medical tests. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges ever resulted against Kirk from any of the investigations. 
Court records show that the only official action was a warning to him from the 
California Medical Board to stop prescribing excessive amounts of drugs.

COUNCIL MAKES RUTH NEW CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a contract promoting Assistant City Manager James 
D. Ruth to the job of the city's top administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 vote Tuesday formalized the selection of a replacement for City Manager 
Bob Simpson, who is retiring May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy that erupted over the selection process rattled City Hall last 
month, with Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilman William D. Ehrle accusing fellow 
council members of meeting secretly to choose Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all pleased that this is behind us and we can move forward with 
the business of the city," Ruth said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrle abstained from the vote, and Hunter was absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel Jim Ruth will be a very good city manager; however, I cannot condone 
the manner in which he was selected," said Ehrle, explaining why he abstained. 
</P>
<P>
He and Hunter have asked the Orange County district attorney and the Orange 
County Grand Jury to investigate whether there was any wrongdoing by the three 
council members during the March selection.

NEW SMOKING RULES URGED FOR EATERIES

<P>
This city, which considers itself a leader in regulations against cigarette 
smokers, took two more steps this week to clear smoke from city restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously to ask city staff to write a city ordinance 
requiring restaurants to provide at least 60% of their space for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also would give restaurant owners the option of banning smoking 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Mendoza, the manager of Ron's in Laguna, spoke against the proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a fine dining restaurant," Mendoza said. "We depend on customers who 
smoke and drink alcohol. Couldn't you leave it up to the patron as to whether 
or not he chooses to go there?" 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 when the city approved its first regulations on smoking in public 
places, City Councilman Neil G. Fitzpatrick said Laguna Beach has fallen behind 
other cities that have adopted stricter regulations. While current city law 
requires Laguna Beach restaurant owners to provide only 25% of their space for 
nonsmokers, cities such as Irvine require that 50% of restaurant space be set 
aside for nonsmokers and Beverly Hills requires 60%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This city was the first in the county to have a ban on smoking in particular 
locations, including restaurants," Fitzpatrick said. "The screw is being turned 
tighter all the time on smoking and I think it's time to add additional 
restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance will have two additional public hearings before it is 
adopted into law, City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger said.LEN HALL

CITY CONSIDERS DRIVE TO FINANCE STADIUMS

<P>
The City Council has voted to hire a fund-raising expert to determine whether 
it is possible to raise about $6 million for a planned Cal State Fullerton 
sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
The joint project by the city and university is about $2.4 million short of the 
$12.5 million needed to build the type of sports facility originally planned, 
City Councilman Richard C. Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
If the consultant finds that a fund-raising effort would not raise enough 
money, the Titan Sports Complex will have to be scaled back to fit the 
$10.2-million budget approved by the city and university, said Sal Rinella, Cal 
State Fullerton's vice president for administration. 
</P>
<P>
The council hoped that contributions from the community would have paid the 
extra $2.4 million needed for the original plan and repaid the city for $3.5 
million it contributed to the project last year after a study re-evaluated the 
cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the sports complex was estimated to cost about $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
If fund-raising is tried, the city and university probably will look for one or 
more large donors, Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to get a major donor to name the sports complex after," he said. 
"I feel confident we'll be able to raise the additional amount." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, voted unanimously to 
pay $22,000 to hire the Robert B. Sharp Co. of Santa Ana to find likely donors 
and draft a proposal that would be submitted to them. 
</P>
<P>
The city and university's joint building committee are scheduled to meet 
Wednesday morning to make up a list of items that could be cut from the project 
if necessary, Rinella said. The list will be submitted to university President 
Jewel Plummer Cobb for her approval. 
</P>
<P>
Possibilities include cutting back on concession booths, restrooms and a press 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Titan Sports Complex is scheduled to begin this summer and 
be finished in early 1992. Plans call for a 10,000-seat stadium for football 
and soccer, a 1,500-seat baseball stadium, a running track, 12 tennis courts 
and various service buildings. TOM McQUEENEY

TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
State helicopters are scheduled tonight to resume spraying malathion over a 
36-square-mile section that includes all of Garden Grove, and parts of 
Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Cypress, Stanton, Anaheim, Orange and Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Parsons, Orange County agricultural deputy commissioner, said the 
spraying is subject to change, depending on weather conditions. Spraying is set 
to begin about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion spraying in an eight-square-mile section of Brea was canceled Monday 
night because of rain. Spraying of that area has been rescheduled for Saturday 
night. Tonight's aerial spraying will be the fourth time that the controversial 
pesticide has been used in the Garden Grove area, where two Mediterranean fruit 
flies were found late last year.

SCHOOL NOT RATTLED BY DRILL TIMING

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a dress rehearsal that couldn't have been more timely. On Wednesday, the 
same morning that a series of earthquakes rocked Northern California, the staff 
and students of Jackson Elementary School staged a full-scale earthquake drill. 
</P>
<P>
The event also inadvertently fell on the 84th anniversary of the 1906 Great 
Earthquake, which devastated San Francisco. And it came the day after sizable 
aftershocks from a Feb. 28 earthquake were felt in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"When we planned the drill, we had no idea that the date we selected fell on 
the anniversary of the San Francisco quake," said Bill Boettcher, risk manager 
for the Santa Ana Unified School District. "But that coincidence and the 
earthquakes of today showed us how vulnerable we really are and how important 
proper training is." 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake drill involved the school's 1,200 students, 70 teachers and 
staff members and dozens of parents. The scenario had a major 7.4 earthquake 
occurring at the Newport-Inglewood Fault, causing widespread damage to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
At the school, emergency stations went into operation, the Santa Ana Fire 
Department was notified and well-planned emergency preparedness plans were 
called into action. Children feigning injuries were brought to first-aid 
stations and attended by volunteers, while teachers marched their classes 
outside for a head count. 
</P>
<P>
First-grade teacher Marie Wood brought her students to the playground after 
conducting a "drop" drill in her classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"No one panicked, and the kids followed directions very well," Wood said. "We 
practiced a lot, and I had a lot of confidence in the children." 
</P>
<P>
But the first-aid station was not just filled with fakers. In all the 
excitement, fifth-grader Tim Nelson suffered a lump on the head when he hit it 
on the corner of his desk while trying to crawl underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were in a real earthquake at first," said Tim, as he held an ice 
pack to his head. "They told us it (the drill) was going to happen, but I 
didn't think it was time yet." 
</P>
<P>
For several of the parents who agreed to participate, the drill proved to be 
unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
"After standing there for 15 minutes and not seeing my kids, I was feeling 
panicky and lightheaded and was getting really nervous," said Effie Coulter, 
the mother of three Jackson students. GREG HERNANDEZ

MURDER CHARGED IN 2 PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC DEATHS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office Wednesday filed two second-degree 
murder charges against a man suspected of drunk driving who allegedly struck 
four pedestrians, killing two, when he accelerated through a crowded crosswalk 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also said the suspect, Ciriaco Mendoza, 46, of Costa Mesa, was 
involved in a hit-and-run accident about two hours before the April 9 incident. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza will be arraigned April 27 on two murder charges, two felony counts of 
driving under the influence of alcohol, a felony count of hit-and-run driving 
and a misdemeanor count of hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor count involved the earlier hit-and-run incident in which 
Mendoza allegedly hit a Pacific Bell van near the intersection of Anaheim and 
Superior avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Alan Kent said the van's driver, Kenneth Melendres of Huntington Beach 
identified Mendoza in a photo lineup as the man who drove away after his 
company van was hit broadside. 
</P>
<P>
Melendres told police that Mendoza's Pontiac drove on the wrong side of the 
road, ran a stop sign and crashed into his van before continuing on Superior 
Avenue, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours later, Mendoza allegedly plowed into four pedestrians in the 
crosswalk. Officers, who said they found several empty beer cans in Mendoza's 
car, initially arrested him on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
hit-and-run. His blood-alcohol level was reported at 0.19%, more than twice the 
legal limit of 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Marion said he decided to upgrade the charges

Marion said the murder charges are supported by the evidence that investigators 
have uncovered.

"This is more than just a DUI," Marion said. "Because of the earlier

There is evidence to show wanton disregard for the safety of others."

CENTRAL CITIES' CENSUS FALLS SHORT; OFFICIALS MEET TO REFIGURE STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOGRAPHICS: ONLY ABOUT SIX OF 10 HOUSEHOLDS IN SANTA ANA, GARDEN GROVE, 
STANTON AND WESTMINSTER HAVE COMPLETED AND RETURNED FORMS. THE GOVERNMENT'S 
GOAL IS 70%.

<P>
Troubled by the modest number of census forms trickling in from central Orange 
County, civic leaders from Santa Ana and several other communities met 
Wednesday with U.S. Census Bureau officials to draw up a strategy for prodding 
residents to complete and mail back the questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
Only about six of 10 households in Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Stanton and 
Westminster have returned the forms, well below the 70% goal set by the Census 
Bureau, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials say they hope to work with community groups and dispatch their 
own troops to get out the message in specific neighborhoods that have recorded 
the poorest performance. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for instance, officials have agreed to target several pockets 
where the return rate has been as low as 42%. They plan this weekend to set up 
tables at a few of the local markets there and offer assistance and 
encouragement to people unfamiliar with the census forms. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also said they will try to recruit influential residents in 
targeted areas and have them go door to door to encourage their neighbors to 
participate in the census. City officials said they also plan to continue their 
promotional efforts, which have included distributing fliers and informational 
brochures and holding public events. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd much rather use our resources at the front end," Fernando Tafoya, the 
Census Bureau's district manager in Santa Ana, said during a press conference 
at its Orange County headquarters. "It will prove a lot less costly if we get 
people to return their forms now" instead of having a census employee knock on 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
If more of the forms aren't returned by the beginning of May, the agency will 
have to hire more people than expected to mount a massive door-to-door head 
count that begins May 3 and continues into the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 100% of all the citizens in the jail counted," J. Tillman Williams, 
vice mayor of Garden Grove, noted during the press conference. "They've all 
been counted. Now we need you." 
</P>
<P>
Even as local officials voiced such pleas, some area residents continued to 
wait for a census form to even arrive in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in several sections of Santa Ana have not received questionnaires. In 
Stanton, meanwhile, about one in seven households have not gotten a census 
form, Mayor Paul Verellen said. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed a "peculiarity of the postal system," noting that most of those who 
did not receive a questionnaire live in sections of the city that have mailing 
addresses in Anaheim or Garden Grove. But the mayor expressed hope that all the 
residents would get their forms in the coming days. Postal Service officials 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
While the return rate has lagged mostly in central sections of the county 
populated by low-income and Spanish-speaking residents, some enclaves for the 
well-to-do have also performed poorly. 
</P>
<P>
In South County, for instance, the return rate hovers around 63%. Residents of 
San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano have done worse, with some neighborhoods 
in those cities recording percentages in the mid-50s, according to William 
Bellamy, census district director for the South County. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't follow the pattern we're seeing elsewhere in the county," Bellamy 
said. "I cannot put my finger on the reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have remained most concerned, however, with the rate of return in 
cities such as Santa Ana, where less than 56% of the residents have returned 
census forms. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Councilman Miguel Pulido said he fears that the city is facing "a 
potential crisis" because of the large number of Latino newcomers who might go 
uncounted. He said that if a sizable percentage is missed he might urge Santa 
Ana officials to join Los Angeles, New York and several other municipalities in 
their lawsuits against the federal government's handling of the census. 
</P>
<P>
But he and fellow Councilman Ron May also noted that there are some encouraging 
signs for the city, where about half the residents are Latino. At a similar 
point during the 1980 census, only about 39% of the households in the city had 
returned their census forms, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENSUS PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census has had a mixed showing in Orange County and elsewhere. Several 
areas of the county have return rates exceeding the bureau's goal of 70% by May 
3, but others have fallen far behind the pace. 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL -- The lowest overall rate of return has been from central Orange 
County cities such as Santa Ana (55.6%), Stanton (56.7%), Garden Grove (64.6%) 
and Westminster (66.4%) 
</P>
<P>
NORTH -- The county's best overall rate of return at 67.7%, about the same as 
the West sector . Census official Joe Montes predicts that the area, which 
includes Anaheim, Fullerton and six other cities, will reach the bureau's goal 
of 70% sometime in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH -- Overall, 63.7% of the households have returned forms, but areas such 
as Leisure World have topped 80%. Several neighborhoods in San Juan Capistrano 
and San Clemente have turned in only about 55% of their forms. 
</P>
<P>
WEST -- More than 67% of forms returned. While people in Sunset Beach have 
returned only about 20% of their forms, Leisure World in Seal Beach has turned 
in a strong performance of 88.1%. Neighborhoods in Los Alamitos have returned 
more than 80%. 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA -- About 58% of the forms have been returned, with Los Angeles 
(58.3%), San Jose (57.1%), San Francisco (61.7%) and San Diego (60.8%) among 
the urban areas still far below census bureau expectations. 
</P>
<P>
NATIONWIDE -- About 62.3% have returned questionnaires.

EDUCATION: TRUSTEES IN NEWPORT BEACH VOTE TO REOPEN LINCOLN ELEMENTARY FOR 
GRADES FOUR THROUGH SIX, A MOVE THAT AFFECTS TWO OTHER SCHOOLS. PARENTS ARE 
FIERCELY OPPOSED.

<P>
Despite hours of appeals from angry parents, the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District board voted Tuesday to reopen Lincoln Elementary School as a middle 
school for grades four through six. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means that Andersen and Harbor View elementary schools and the 
Eastbluff Kindergarten Center will house children in kindergarten through third 
grade when Lincoln opens in the fall of 1992. Lincoln will serve students in 
the Corona del Mar High School zone. 
</P>
<P>
The board's 4-3 vote culminated a three-month controversy in the district, with 
parents from Andersen and Harbor View supportive of keeping their schools K-6 
and reopening Lincoln as an additional K-6. Parents argued that overcrowding at 
Harbor View and Andersen could be reduced by opening Lincoln and redrawing 
school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 p.m. vote followed two hours of statements from residents and a parents 
ad hoc committee in support of the K-6 configuration. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Sandland, a member of the ad hoc committee, was among the first to address 
the seven member panel. 
</P>
<P>
"If we truly believed that (a new middle school) would be better for our 
children we would turn around now and do everything that we could to convince 
other parents that it really was better," Sandland said. "We can't do that, 
there isn't one of us who can." 
</P>
<P>
Sandland's speech and most others backing the K-6 structure were greeted with 
applause from the approximately 125 people who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said that a six-year school builds strong bonds between teachers and 
students. They argued that the new configuration would result in lower property 
values because many people move to the neighborhood so their children can walk 
or ride to school. 
</P>
<P>
When Lincoln reopens, the majority of students will have to be bused several 
miles to the school. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an enormous lack of trust in the board and the district to deliver 
what it promises and this exists in our community," said Harbor View parent 
Denny Lynn Engelke to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"If you must, after serious consideration, decide in favor of a K-3, 4-6 
configuration, against the wishes of a large majority of the community, I 
implore you to put your money where your vision is: Give us buses, safety 
provisions, supplies and exemplary leadership and staff. And have it all there 
on the first day of school in September of 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Loofbourrow, the Corona del Mar district board member, was one of those 
supporting reopening Lincoln as a 4-6 grade school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what it does is it combines the strengths of the two schools," 
Loofbourrow said. "Teachers can focus even more completely on the needs of the 
child at each level." 
</P>
<P>
Ron McMillan, another proponent of the new schooling structure, said it would 
be an educational benefit to the students. Board President Judy Franco also 
supported the new configuration, telling the audience that in another school 
district the 4-6 structure has been "highly successful." Board member Forest 
Werner also voted for the new school configuration. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Jim de Boom, Kenneth Wayman and Tom Williams voted against the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
After the emotional meeting, parents, a few tearful over the vote, gathered 
outside to express their dismay with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been more proud of the people that I live and work with," said 
Candi Grant, the primary spokeswoman for the ad hoc committee.

SWAP MEET GETS SANTIAGO COLLEGE BOARD'S BACKING

<P>
Before a crowd of more than 100 people, the Rancho Santiago College Board of 
Trustees on Wednesday unanimously agreed that a swap meet held each Sunday in 
the college parking lot does not harm the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn. had complained that El 
Mercado, a mostly Latino swap meet, brings traffic, trash and noise to their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The group was lobbying to have it moved to another location. 
</P>
<P>
But board members said they were satisfied with the results of a court-ordered 
study of the swap meet's impact on the area, which was conducted by the 
Irvine-based firm of S/R Lamoureaux. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are very few areas of negative impact," Trustee Shirley 
Ralston said. "In the few areas where there are concerns, we'll be very happy 
to sit down with the community and talk." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Rush, a member of the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn.'s board of 
directors, told the board that his group was open to negotiations to settle the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
For the large crowd of vendors who spoke in support of the swap meet, the 
board's decision came as good news. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very relieved," said Edward Salcedo, manager of El Mercado. "We were 
very concerned about the possibility of the swap meet having to shut down. It 
really means a lot to many people." 
</P>
<P>
The board still faces a lawsuit filed by the city charging that the swap meet 
violates Santa Ana zoning laws.

DRUG WAR MUST BE FOUGHT IN U.S., NANCY REAGAN SAYS IN IRVINE TALK

Former First Lady Nancy Reagan said Wednesday that the war on drugs should be 
fought at home, not abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the United States alone that bears the responsibility of its own drug 
problem," Mrs. Reagan said during a speech at the Irvine Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
"While most drugs are imported, most drug users are home-grown." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a crowd of about 450 people, Mrs. Reagan said that while it is easy 
to criticize the drug cartels, it is more difficult to "talk about the pair of 
Wall Street investors who buy cocaine on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the drug user that makes cartels possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan's comments followed a dinner to raise funds for the Santa Ana-based 
Assessment and Treatment Services Center, a nonprofit counseling program for 
high-risk juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
More than $100,000 was raised for the center's juvenile counseling program, 
spokeswoman Tammy Guiso said. 
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the event were Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates and Newport 
Beach Police Detective Lavonne Campbell, who outlined a variety of county and 
city anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, Mrs. Reagan has paid a number of visits to Orange County, appearing 
at charity events and conferences to espouse her well-known anti-drug slogan 
"Just Say No" and to reminisce about her White House years. 
</P>
<P>
Last month she delivered a speech at the Four Seasons Hotel on her experience 
with cancer. After the speech, she traveled to Hoag Hospital to meet with more 
than two dozen cancer patients.

TITANS' MURPHY FINALIST FOR JOB AT SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Murphy, who has been interviewed for a number of jobs during his 10-year 
tenure as Cal State Fullerton's football coach, is one of three finalists for 
the vacant head coaching position at San Jose State, according to Spartan 
assistant Rick Rasnick. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick, the team's offensive coordinator who also is a finalist, confirmed 
that Murphy interviewed at the school last Friday and is a candidate along with 
California offensive coordinator Terry Shea. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who was a finalist for the Nevada Las Vegas job this past winter, 
refused to comment on the San Jose State position and would not confirm that he 
had interviewed there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say a word about it, and that's all I'm going to say," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick said Wednesday that he expects the school to make a decision today, 
Friday or early next week. Among the other candidates interviewed were former 
Detroit Lions coach Darryl Rogers, who coached the Spartans from 1976-78, Rams 
assistant Artie Gigantino and Penn State assistant Ron Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
The four-man screening committee that interviewed candidates includes athletic 
director Randy Hoffman, junior defensive back Hesh Colar; Dan Buerger, 
executive assistant to the school president, and Dr. Charles Whitcomb, the 
school's faculty representative to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't given me any time frame, but I think it's going to happen 
quickly," Rasnick said. "They've interviewed everyone, talked to everyone, and 
I think they're close to making a decision." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News quoted Colar this week as saying the three candidates 
are "all pretty even with a little more emphasis on Murphy and Shea. . . . The 
players like Rasnick. The only concern with the committee is his lack of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Colar then told the Mercury News Wednesday that the committee had pared its 
list to Murphy and Shea, but Rasnick said Wednesday night that he had not been 
notified of such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick and Shea said they have not been offered the job or been told they 
weren't going to receive offers. 
</P>
<P>
One potential stumbling block for Murphy may be that, according to Rasnick, a 
new coach wouldn't be able to hire assistants from the outside until next 
December. The six current Spartan assistants are on contract through the 1990 
season, and the school cannot afford to pay two staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that would be unappealing to someone coming in from the outside, 
but you never know," Rasnick said. "The whole timing of this has been unique 
and has created some confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Shea, who was the offensive coordinator at San Jose State from 1984-86, said 
the staff situation wouldn't deter him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached with about half the guys who are there now, and I would feel 
comfortable with the ones I know," Shea said. "I'm prepared to handle that." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose State job opened up when six-year coach Claude Gilbert was fired 
on March 21. The administration listed minor NCAA rules violations, a low 
graduation rate among football players and differences in recruiting 
philosophies as reasons for dismissing Gilbert, who last week filed a wrongful 
termination grievance with the university. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who has earned praise for building a competitive program despite the 
Titans' meager budget and lack of an on-campus stadium, has a 54-60-1 record 
and has won two conference championships, in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He was a finalist for the UNLV position last December, but the job went to 
former Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong. Murphy also met with Utah Athletic 
Director Chris Hill about the position there, but was not formally interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was in demand in 1984, after the Titans went 11-1. He was offered the 
vacant job at Utah that year, and withdrew from consideration at Oregon State 
at the leading candidate. He chose to pursue the Missouri job, but the job went 
to Woody Widenhofer. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murphy, the coach's son who is a sophomore at Fullerton, said he's not 
sure his father would accept the job if it is offered. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be like all the other job offers, when he says, 'Oh, well, I think 
I'll just stay here,' " the younger Murphy said. "I know he's talked to them 
(San Jose State officials), but he hasn't told me anything else. I have a 
feeling he'll be here next season."

SANTA ANA VALLEY FALLS TO A REVIVED VILLA PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
A week away from the Century League baseball race did wonders for Villa Park 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, a team slipping in the league standings, managed to latch on to a 
little consistency during spring break. They won three of four games in the 
Santa Ana Elks tournament, losing only to El Toro in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Villa Park returned to league play and maintained that level of 
play. The Spartans, behind the pitching of Todd Blyleven, beat Santa Ana 
Valley, 3-0, to remain in a third-place tie with El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 1 1/2 games behind Canyon and Foothill, who share first place. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to sustain the momentum we built during the Santa Ana tournament," 
Coach Dave Ochoa said. "I thought it was important that we come back with a win 
in league." 
</P>
<P>
So Ocha gave the ball to Blyleven, the team's most consistent pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven (4-2), who entered the game with an earned-run average of 0.56, 
allowed three hits while pitching his third shutout of the season. He struck 
out 11, bringing his season total to 63. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's the one guy who's been consistent all season," Ochoa said. "We expect a 
great game from him every time he goes out there." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley was also coming off a good showing in the Santa Ana Elks 
tournament. The Falcons won three of four games to win the consolation 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had been hurting ourselves with mental mistakes all season," Coach 
Herschel Musick said. "But last week we seemed to pull things together." 
</P>
<P>
They came apart again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons made three costly mistakes that led to three runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, the Spartans' Alex Vicario led off with a single to right field. 
However, Armando Cueva let the ball get past him in right, which allowed 
Vicario to reach third base. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Boone followed with a sacrifice fly to score Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the inning, James Hong walked and went to second on an error. 
He scored on a single by Jason Martian. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (11-6-1 and 4-4 in league play) added another run in the fifth 
when Boone scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very opportunistic today," Ochoa said. "We got a couple breaks and 
made the most of them. It was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Especially with Blyleven on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons (8-10, 2-6) had only one runner get as far as third base through 
six innings. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 5, Canyon 4 (10 innings) -- Gavin Brown doubled in the top of the 
10th and scored on an error on Bill Fischer's ground ball. Canyon (7-10-1, 
5-2-1) led, 4-0, before El Modena (9-7, 5-2) tied the score with a run in the 
sixth and three in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 6, Foothill 2 -- Jesse Rosas, who struck out five in four innings, 
and John Morales held Foothill to five hits and Dan Alvarez had two RBIs during 
a five-run third inning for host Santa Ana (7-11, 3-5). Santa Ana is the only 
Century League team that has beaten Foothill (8-9-1, 5-2-1) this season.

THOUGH FRENZY IS OVER, HOME SALES STILL BRISK IN SOUTH COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
It takes longer to sell them these days, but despite continued rumblings of a 
slowdown, homes in South Orange County are enjoying brisk sales, officials of 
Grubb &amp; Ellis Residential Brokerage Services said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The frenzy of the late 1980s -- a period in which homes often sold for more 
than the original asking price as eager buyers bid up prices -- has ended. But 
sales aren't exactly slumping, said Milton E. Naylor, executive vice president 
and regional manager for the real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got is just a return to a normal, healthy, realistic market," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor and other Grubb &amp; Ellis executives made their observations Wednesday 
as they unveiled the company's annual market survey for the 14-community region 
south of the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on sales figures provided by the region's boards of realtors, 
found that homes in the southern communities stayed on the market an average of 
79 days during the last half of 1989, or 46% longer than during the same period 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, average sales prices continued to climb and sellers 
weren't forced to slash prices in order to move their properties, Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers "are not showing any resistance at all to prices," provided that 
the asking price has not been artificially inflated, said Tom Golden, manager 
of Grubb &amp; Ellis Mortgage Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers were doing a lot more shopping around," said Jim Vermilya, district 
manager for Laguna Beach and the Dana Point-Laguna Niguel area. "We've seen an 
marked increase in buyer activity in the first quarter of this year." 
</P>
<P>
Although 79 days sounds like a long time, Naylor said, "throw out the 
superheated market of 1987 to 1989, and the recessionary market of 1981-82, and 
79 days is about normal." 
</P>
<P>
Homes sold fastest in the Newport Beach area, staying on the market an average 
of only 55 days, even though the area had the second-highest average sales 
price -- $543,030 -- of the communities surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente homes sold the slowest, taking an average of 121 days to sell. 
Capistrano Beach was the next slowest at 103 days, followed by Dana Point, 97 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach-South Laguna area posted the highest average selling price, 
$625,841. Prices in that area rose the most of any of the communities, up 30% 
from the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Beach reported the next largest gain, with the average sales price 
increasing 25.7% to $352,000 during the last half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor warned against drawing conclusions from the figures, noting that trends 
develop over years, not months, and that average sales figures can be skewed by 
extremely large or small transactions and by the type of housing available on 
the market during any given period. 
</P>
<P>
He said Grubb &amp; Ellis has begun computing median sales prices -- the point 
at which half the homes sell for more and half sell for less -- and will 
compare medians rather than averages in future reports. Grubb &amp; Ellis has 
nine retail offices in South County. 
</P>
<P>
Citing California Assn. of Realtors' figures for resale single-family homes, 
Naylor said the median sales price in all of Orange County appreciated at a 
rate of 18.6% in 1989, contrasted with 4.3% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
HIGHS AND LOWS IN SOUTH COUNTY HOUSING 
</P>
<P>
Here are figures on pricing and market duration for selected Orange County 
communities during the period from July to December, 1989, as compiled by Grubb 
&amp; Ellis.

Open for Business: After two years of delays, Laguna Bank finally received the 
last installment on $1.6 million in new capital on April 6. That afternoon, the 
rumors started flying. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have had 40 phone calls in the last two weeks asking us whether we've 
been closed or sold or whether we were closing our branch and moving to Laguna 
Hills," said Donald R. Narup, the bank's president. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the bank, there was no run on deposits, Narup said. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors, believed to be spread by disgruntled former employees, aren't true, 
he said. The bank, which has struggled financially for the last few years to 
overcome losses caused by bad loans, is starting anew with more capital than 
regulators require.

COMMERCE SECRETARY WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE PACT; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: ROBERT A. MOSBACHER TELLS ELECTRONICS EXECUTIVES IN IRVINE THAT THE 
U.S. WILL TAKE TOUGH ACTION IF THE AGREEMENT ISN'T FOLLOWED.

<P>
A top Bush Administration official warned Wednesday that Japan can expect tough 
action from the United States later this year if it fails to live up to 
provisions of a bilateral trade pact signed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to electronics industry executives at an Irvine luncheon, Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher predicted that the U.S. trade deficit will fall 
below $100 billion this year for the first time in seven years. The nation's 
trade gap hit $113.2 billion last year, with Japan accounting for nearly half 
the total. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said in an interview that if Japan shows "a consistent pattern" of 
keeping foreign goods out of its market and if "the big changes we expect from 
the pact we signed recently do not come" by year's end, then the Bush 
Administration may take retaliatory action against Japan. His remarks came 
hours after the government reported that the nation's trade deficit shrank 
sharply to $6.49 billion in February, the smallest imbalance for a month in 
more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan was cited under Super 301 of the Omnibus Trade Law for unfair 
trade practices. Congress may take punitive action against Japan if 
investigations show that there is no marked improvement in opening its market 
to foreign products. A U.S.-Japan trade agreement announced two weeks ago is 
intended to reduce the $49-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be monitoring (the agreement), and we know we'll be making progress 
when the cash registers ring," he said. "This is the first step of many to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said the U.S. government does not view the trade pact as concessions 
on Japan's part, but rather as "progress in an open market." Although the 
United States would like to see many U.S. industries be able to sell their 
goods in Japan, the semiconductor and automobile components industries 
currently offer the brightest opportunities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Western Europe, Mosbacher expressed concern that standards set by 
European nations in such fields as engineering, chemistry and high-technology 
could bar American products from being sold in those nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be there to make sure that U.S. standards are not excluded, and we 
will make sure that local content requirement is not so high that U.S. 
companies will have to set up operations there," he said. Local content rules 
mandate that a fixed percentage of the parts contained in imported products be 
manufactured in the nation where they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said the Commerce Department will open a trade office in Brussels 
later this year to help American firms monitor changes expected by the planned 
1992 economic unification of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, who spoke to members of the Orange County chapter of the American 
Electronic Assn., said Commerce and the Defense Department are working to 
streamline export regulations to make it easier to sell high-tech products 
abroad. He said the new regulations should be available for review by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
"We're likely to see a higher level of verification (of) materials with 
potential military applications are concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher also reiterated President Bush's eight-point program to make the 
United States globally competitive in the 1990s. This program includes reforms 
of product liability and antitrust laws and steps to improve the quality of 
U.S. education and American-made goods. Mosbacher added that the Bush 
Administration wants to make research and development tax credits permanent to 
encourage U.S. firms to plan for the long term and invest more in new product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
After the luncheon, the commerce secretary held a closed-door meeting with top 
executives from Western Digital Corp., an Irvine computer company, to discuss 
exports of computers to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, according to a 
Mosbacher aide. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher also visited a Fountain Valley computer factory of AST Research Inc. 
Last week, the Irvine personal computer maker became the first U.S. company to 
begin marketing a machine in Japan to compete directly with NEC Corp., Japan's 
leading PC maker.

KEATING DENIES HE TRIED TO GET OFFICIALS FIRED; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING: BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES TAKING COMPLAINTS ABOUT ONE TOP OFFICIAL TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.

Financier Charles H. Keating Jr. on Wednesday rejected a suggestion that he 
tried to remove any thrift regulator who challenged him, but he acknowledged 
that he took his complaints about one top official as far as to the White House 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Office of Thrift Supervision attorney James Murphy, defending the government's 
April, 1989, seizure of Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., suggested 
during the hearing in U.S. District Court that Keating believed that every 
regulator who challenged him was motivated by personal animosity and that 
Keating tried to have that person fired or removed from his case. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, finishing eight days of testimony in a hearing related to his suit to 
recover the thrift, denied that. 
</P>
<P>
"Had I been listened to, this country would be $500 billion better off," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, asked whether he had tried to get Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board, fired, Keating replied: "I spoke with the Administration 
about it. Yes. I thought he was wrecking the industry." 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question from U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, Keating 
identified then-Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan as the Reagan Administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Keating told reporters that he did not believe the meeting in Regan's office 
influenced Regan, who he said had become unhappy with Gray long before. 
</P>
<P>
Gray has said Regan tried to force him to resign before his term expired at the 
end of June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Regan meeting is only one example of the length of Keating's political 
reach. Five senators who accepted political contributions from Keating are 
being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for having met with 
regulators on his behalf in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision has asked Sporkin to dismiss Keating's suit. 
Sporkin could eventually decide to uphold the seizure, find it invalid or order 
a full trial. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his testimony Wednesday, Keating testily dismissed a government 
attorney's suggestion that he had used Lincoln in an attempt to persuade Saudi 
investors to support his Arizona real estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absurd!" Keating responded. 
</P>
<P>
The contention that Keating used the federally insured deposits in Lincoln for 
his holding company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, is a key point in 
the government's argument justifying the seizure of Lincoln. They estimate 
Lincoln's collapse will cost the taxpayers $2 billion.

<P>
SUPREME COURT: SCHOLARS SAY THE DECISION UPHOLDING OHIO PORNOGRAPHY LAW IS 
UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON CINCINNATI DISPUTE. BUT SOME SEE THE 
PROSECUTION AS AN ESCALATION OF THREATS TO ARTISTIC FREEDOM.

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling Wednesday upholding an Ohio child pornography 
statute slightly roils the controversy over the exhibition of photographs by 
the late Robert Mapplethorpe at a Cincinnati museum, but the effect is likely 
to be slight, legal scholars agreed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld an Ohio law making it a crime to possess so-called kiddie-porn 
materials -- even in the privacy of one's home. While two of seven Mapplethorpe 
photographs held by a Cincinnati grand jury to be obscene are images of young 
children in various stages of undress, the newly affirmed Ohio law apparently 
includes language that leaves legitimate museum displays unaffected, legal 
scholars agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But experts in arts and obscenity law agreed that broader-brush implications of 
the obscenity prosecution by city officials of the Contemporary Arts Center for 
exhibiting a show of Mapplethorpe's work represent a potentially frightening 
escalation of threats to artistic freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
Yet other experts -- though they agreed that the risks to arts freedom implicit 
in the Cincinnati prosecution are real and the stakes high -- suggested 
Wednesday the case may end up helping to resolve the yearlong national debate 
over what is appropriate for government to control in the content of art. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has focused primarily on the financing and regulatory authority over 
the National Endowment for the Arts, the federal government's most visible 
cultural agency. 
</P>
<P>
Even one of the nation's best known conservative lawyers -- a man Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) recommended to testify in support of his opposition to the NEA 
at a Senate hearing next week -- condemned the action of Cincinnati prosecutors 
as "counterintuitive and wrongheaded." 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati museum was criminally charged 10 days ago after police and local 
prosecutors objected to the sexually explicit nature of some of the 
Mapplethorpe images. The charges resulted from a weeks-long controversy over 
the erotic content of the Mapplethorpe show, which roused controversy last year 
when the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington refused to accept it in a failed 
attempt to lessen controversy over the exhibit's role in the NEA furor. A local 
judge has said he will meet with prosecutors and museum lawyers April 30 to try 
to scheduled a trial date. The museum and curator Dennis Barrie were charged 
with two misdemeanor counts of pandering and illegal use of a minor in 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Parading a local grand jury through the Mapplethorpe "The Perfect Moment" 
exhibit, said Bruce Fein, a private legal consultant formerly on the staff of 
the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, "was extremely 
injudicious." The charges against the museum and Barrie cannot possibly meet 
requirements for legitimate sexually explicit art established by the Supreme 
Court in a landmark 1973 ruling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is that case -- Miller vs. California -- that appears to remain the 
controling element in the legal drama the Contemporary Arts Center-Mapplethorpe 
case has brought into being. In Miller, the Supreme Court established a 
three-way test to be used to decide whether something can be legally declared 
obscene. The material in question must be interpreted "by the average person, 
applying contemporary community standards" as something that "taken as a whole, 
appeals to the prurient interest." 
</P>
<P>
But it must also be material that is sexual in "a patently offensive way" and 
that in its entirety "lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific 
value." 
</P>
<P>
The Mapplethorpe photos, said a variety of legal experts, might be construed as 
challenging the first two elements of the Miller test. But, said Fein and Floyd 
Abrams, a noted Washington First Amendment lawyer, it is almost inconceivable 
that the process by which respected, curators at a mainstream museum like the 
Contemporary Arts Center select work for displayed could fail to meet the 
Miller standards in the all important third area. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't usually walk into museums to have their prurient interests 
aroused," said Fein. "I think it's a very maladroit use of the criminal justice 
system to go after a curator here. This is not some kind of degenerate conduct 
that is worthy of criminal prosecution. It's very difficult to suggest that 
this is a kind of an adult shady bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams agreed, calling the case against the Cincinnati museum "outside the 
realm of obscenity prosecutions in living memory." But with the Wednesday 
Supreme Court ruling as a backdrop, Abrams contended the potential for serious 
effects of the Mapplethorpe case is great, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
If the museum and curator are convicted, Abrams said, the Supreme Court might 
decline to accept an appeal -- an action that would not alter the existing 
national obscenity doctrine, but would leave the conviction intact. The court, 
Abrams said, could hold that if any Cincinnati jury that convicted the museum 
was properly instructed in the Miller case doctrine, it would be best to simply 
back off and leave the Contemporary Arts Center and its curator with a 
conviction in its record. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my bottom line is people are right in saying the (Cincinnati) case may 
just go away and maybe this is just a spasmodic flurry," Abrams said. But in 
the context of the situation's potential to add to the chilling effects already 
engendered by the fractious, year-long NEA debate, he said, "this has within it 
the potential to be a very large case." 
</P>
<P>
H. Louis Sirkin, the Cincinnati museum's attorney, said he has been prepared to 
deal with the Ohio child-porn law since the charges were brought -- so 
Wednesday's ruling doesn't affect the museum significantly. But, said Sirkin, 
the case has the potential for enormous effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Art to me, and particularly contemporary art, shows the good, the bad, the 
indifferent," Sirkin said. "That's what Mapplethorpe was doing, showing life as 
it was to him. When we start to tread on what an artists or the art world 
thinks, then you're starting to tread on the freedom of expression." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the potential for major ramifications, though, Anne Murphy, director of 
the Washington-based American Arts Alliance, said the clouds created by the 
Cincinnati crisis may turn out to have a silver lining, after all. "I think in 
the long run, this is helpful," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are forced now to sit back and look at some of the 
ramifications. It really comes to to what is more harmful to the American way 
of life, a few pieces of art or the police invading institutions of higher 
learning. It gets pretty darn clear. The question is not what is good art or 
bad art or dirty art. The question is who makes the decision."

RAPPERS GO TO THE SOURCE FOR ANTI-GANG VIDEO; 
</P>
<P>
POP: THEY TAPE 'ALL IN THE SAME GANG' AND HOLD A NO-MORE-WARS SUMMIT AT THE 
NICKERSON GARDENS HOUSING PROJECT. SOME ONLOOKERS DOUBT THE EFFORT WILL DO ANY 
GOOD.

<P>
Nickerson Gardens, the poverty-plagued Watts housing project, is the classic 
breeding ground for rap music. But when some of the top West Coast rappers held 
a summit meeting there Tuesday to shoot an anti-gang rap video, they seemed 
strangely out of place. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the way most of them dressed -- the black T-shirts, caps and jackets 
sported by the likes of Eazy-E and Tone Loc looked right at home. It was more 
the spectacle of the lights, cameras and (limited) action taking place amid the 
blue buildings of the compound. 
</P>
<P>
A certain amount of life as usual went on. People came and went and took care 
of their daily business. Laundry swayed in the breeze from lines strung between 
the buildings, even while the mass of rappers themselves swayed to a funky beat 
while lip-syncing "All in the Same Gang," a new song calling for an end to gang 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
The venture was put together by Mike Concepcion, who calls himself a co-founder 
of the Crips gang. He has left gang violence behind in favor of starting a 
record company called Grand Jury Records. 
</P>
<P>
The song and video scheduled to be released through Warner Bros. Records on May 
15 are the company's first recordings. The song will also be the centerpiece of 
an album that will feature new rap artists, scheduled for June 12 release. 
Proceeds will benefit Project Build, an employment counseling, assessment and 
referral service for six Watts housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm never out (of the gang) -- it's always in my heart," said Concepcion, a 
paraplegic as a result of a bullet fired in a street gambling dispute. "But I'm 
tired of all these guys killing each other." 
</P>
<P>
Through the taping, a security force of mostly white off-duty police officers 
surveyed the scene, assisted by community members decked out in Amnesty 
International "Human Rights Now" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
The onlookers -- kids and adults alike -- seemed more interested in the 
performers than their message, though. Each star arrival brought screams from 
the onlookers, who took every opportunity for photo and autograph hounding. 
</P>
<P>
And while in front of the cameras the rappers shook their bodies, the Nickerson 
residents stood behind the yellow police tape security line shaking their heads 
about the potential effect of the video on the community. 
</P>
<P>
"When they all leave it's gonna be same old same old," said Imogene Cosey, 26, 
a former Nickerson resident who had come to watch after hearing about the 
taping on rap radio station KDAY-AM. 
</P>
<P>
One 15-year-old boy who claimed gang affiliation said it would have no impact 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
"You die one day anyway," he said, acknowledging the risks of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much money in dope," said Sylvin Flores, 18, standing next to the gang 
member. "You have to understand why they create the violence so you can create 
your own peace." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the performers expressed doubts about the reach of the video. 
Eazy-E, whose hits as a solo act and as a member of the controversial group 
N.W.A have depicted gang activity in a way some believe glorifies the violence, 
had in the past said he would never take part in any such "message" project. 
</P>
<P>
During a lunch break he admitted that his tune had changed a little. 
</P>
<P>
"It can help," he said. "Some are gonna listen to it, some gonna be hard-headed 
and not listen. There are other ways to make money other than (gangs) and dope. 
You could be a producer like me. You just gotta give them a chance." 
</P>
<P>
But Eazy stressed his lyrical contribution to "Same Gang," in which he raps 
"Eazy's no sell-out" and "I'm not tryin' to tell ya what to do / You have your 
own freedom of choice who to listen to," and concludes by refering to himself 
as "the violent hero." 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to people what they do," he said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the performers admitted that they had little hope for saving any 
current gang members. The video, they said, is for the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to stop anything right away," said Loc, whose "Wild Thing" is 
one of the biggest-selling rap singles ever. "The older ones are too set in 
their ways. No one can tell them what to do. No one can tell me what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"But it may stop some of the 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds. If we can start from this 
and build and move on, go into the community and do something, we can let those 
kids know there's hope and more to life than getting high and kickin' with the 
homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
To Concepcion, the very act of making the video showed hope. "The fact that we 
could bring N.W.A and Tone Loc to do a video here and to have me, a Crip, come 
to this (rival gang) Blood neighborhood to do this is a sign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to some members of the production crew, arranging for the video shoot 
did present some problems. One person, who asked not to be named, said that 
some of the performers who had had gang affiliation in the past expressed 
concerns about coming to the site for fear of rival gang presence. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, there seemed little to worry about, with the high security presence. 
</P>
<P>
"But the police are leaving at sundown," said the production crew member. "So 
we're leaving at sundown." 
</P>
<P>
And after sundown, the gang problem would again be in the hands of the people 
who live in the middle of it. And that suits Nickerson resident Sharon Robbins 
fine. The 21-year-old mother of three young children said that she, not rap 
stars, bears the responsibility for eventually keeping her youngsters out of 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're not gonna get in gangs," she said. " I got a good leather belt. 
I'll whip their (behinds)."

CRITIC AT LARGE: THE REINCARNATION OF 'CARNIVAL OF SOULS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The movies have always fervently believed there is life after death, and many a 
Dracula remake attests to it. So, in a double sense, does Harold (Heck) 
Harvey's "Carnival of Souls." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 years after it was made, Harvey's ghoulish little thriller is getting 
the kind of reviews and playdates it never had when it was first released. In 
Los Angeles, it opens Friday at Laemmle's Monica Premiere Showcase complex and, 
having been a bootleg tape for years, will be out in a genuine commercial 
cassette later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The delayed acclaim has brought new attention to Harvey, a now-retired 
industrial filmmaker from Lawrence, Kan., who never made another feature, and 
to Candace Hilligoss, a New York actress (20 when she did "Carnival of Souls"), 
who retired from acting in favor of motherhood not long afterward and who is 
now a writer, living in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I was paid $2,000 for doing the film," Hilligoss said at lunch earlier this 
week. "It seemed like a fortune, so much so that my husband quit his job as a 
waiter to concentrate on his acting career and got his first Broadway part 
almost immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Hilligoss had gone to New York from Huron, S.D., to seek her own career. "I 
took three pairs of tap shoes and $500 and my father said that when the $500 
was gone I'd have to come home. That was all there would be." 
</P>
<P>
She won a scholarship to the American Theatre Wing and found a job in the 
chorus line at Jules Podell's Copacabana nightclub to support herself. "I was 
so naive; I thought Mafia was the name of the house dressing. The customers 
were right out of Damon Runyon's 'Guys and Dolls.' " But her legs were 
appreciatively reviewed by both Walter Winchell and Earl Wilson and she got a 
young agent who, like herself, was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"I invited him to a screening of 'Carnival,' and afterward he looked at me and 
said: 'You're weird. You'll hurt my career.' He walked out and I never heard 
from him again." 
</P>
<P>
It's a weird role, all right. She plays Mary Henry, one of three young women in 
a car drag-racing with two of the local swain. Her driver loses control on a 
narrow bridge and they plunge into a river where all three are presumably 
drowned. But she reappears, wet and sandy and forever changed, but able to 
resume her career as a church organist. 
</P>
<P>
Where we are is in early Twilight Zone and the movie's charm is in its mixture 
of sophistication of form and naivete of story, its blending of innocence and 
guile. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview this week, Heck Harvey, who retired three years ago, 
said he'd been driving back to Kansas in 1961 after making an industrial film 
in Los Angeles when, just outside Salt Lake City, he saw the great ornate ruin 
of Saltair, a once booming lake resort that boasted the largest unobstructed 
ballroom in the world. Changing times and a receding lake (floating in salt 
water was one of the lures) had put it out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey found he could rent it -- for $50. "When I got back to Lawrence, I asked 
my friend and co-worker at Centron Films, John Clifford, who was a writer 
there, how he'd like to write a feature. The last scene, I told him, had to be 
a whole bunch of ghouls dancing in that ballroom; the rest was up to him. He 
wrote it in three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Later in 1961, having gone to New York and cast Hilligoss, Harvey and a crew of 
six shot the film in three weeks ("working seven days a week and sometimes 
around the clock," Hilligoss remembers vividly). The original budget was 
$17,000, raised in small chunks from local investors. Later he raised another 
$13,000 to complete the film. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the crew double as actors. Harvey himself played the ghoul, in white 
makeup with black-rimmed eyes and frock coat to match, who pursues Hilligoss 
and lures her at last to the spooky ballroom. "That was part ego and more 
economics," Harvey says. "Mostly economics. When you've only got $17,000 cash, 
you get thrifty." 
</P>
<P>
Shooting permits? Forget it. Hilligoss remembers that when they wanted to shoot 
a sequence in a Salt Lake department store, the crew simply wandered in to the 
dress department and Harvey gave a pretty sales clerk $25 to let them shoot in 
a dressing room and then to pretend she couldn't see Hilligoss at all. (The 
character becomes invisible at inconvenient moments.) 
</P>
<P>
"When they wanted to have me almost hit by a bus," she says (a scene that 
doesn't survive in the film), "we just went to the bus depot and Heck knocked 
on the door of a bus that was just leaving on a run to L.A. He asked the driver 
if he'd just slam on the brakes when I ran in front of him. The driver said 
sure. On the first take, Heck said I wasn't close enough to the bus, so the 
driver backed up and did it again. This time the bus brushed me and Heck said 
it was fine. The driver said, 'Want to do 'er again?' " 
</P>
<P>
At the train station, an executive came by and asked what the devil was going 
on. Harvey, Hilligoss says, took him aside and mentioned that two of the 
industrial films he'd done had been for the railroad. "When Heck got through," 
Hilligoss says, "I think the man would have given us a train." 
</P>
<P>
When the film was finished, Harvey went to independent distributors, all but 
one of whom rejected it because of its lack of sex or violence. A small new Los 
Angeles outfit accepted it, with unfortunate consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"I took off to do a series of seven industrial films in South America," Harvey 
says. "When I got back I heard that the film was playing around and I called 
the distributor and said I figured we had some money coming. He agreed that was 
right and sent a check. It bounced. I knew we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, although Harvey had retained the television rights, the distributor 
sold an estimated 80 bootleg prints to various stations and then tiptoed off to 
Europe beyond the reach of prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Harvey says, neither he nor his investors have seen a cent from 
"Carnival of Souls," although now, with a new and enthusiastic distributor, 
Panorama, and with the film finding playdates in several cities, the drought 
may well be broken. 
</P>
<P>
The original distributor had at least assured "Carnival of Souls" an 
underground life. The bootleg prints played endlessly on late-night television 
and Halloween specials and on film series and in revival houses, including the 
Thalia in New York. It acquired a small but fanatic following. 
</P>
<P>
One of the followers presented it as a cult classic at last year's USA Film 
Festival in Dallas and it has since become a festival favorite. "I'm off to 
Cleveland next week for a festival there," Heck Harvey reports. 
</P>
<P>
Last November cast and crew had a reunion at the house in Lawrence where much 
of the interior action was shot and People magazine did a ghoulish story. The 
film has been reviewed in The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, born in Colorado, was stationed in Lawrence during World War II, liked 
it, returned to major in theater at the University of Kansas there and taught 
in the department before he got into industrial films, of which he made more 
than 200. Harvey married one of the investors in "Carnival." "She'd already 
lost her $1,000 so I figured she really must love me." They are still married. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant director and assistant cameraman on "Carnival of Souls" was Reza 
Badiyi, now a prominent television director in Hollywood, then working at 
another industrial film company in Kansas City, Calvin Films, with a young 
director named Robert Altman. "Bob had just made his first feature, 'The 
Delinquents,' and I figured if he could do it, we could, so we made 'Carnival.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But, burned by the "Carnival of Souls" experience, Harvey never tried another 
feature, although he has directed local productions of some three-act plays 
John Clifford has been writing. Now, Harvey says, with all the belated acclaim 
that has come his way, "We're beginning to get some nibbles. John and I had 
actually prepared another feature, which we were going to do before the idea of 
'Carnival' came along." 
</P>
<P>
Hilligoss moved to Beverly Hills 10 years ago, her marriage having broken up 
after 20 years ("another chapter of 'War of the Roses' "). Her daughters are 24 
and 26, and she is writing a novel based on a screenplay she also wrote. "I'm 
700 pages in," she says, "and I want it to do for the Upper Midwest what 'Gone 
With the Wind' did for the South." 
</P>
<P>
That's a tall order. Then again, when you make a movie for $2,000 and have to 
wait 30 years for the favoring reviews to come in, your ideas change about what 
isn't possible, and what is.

<P>
Central Westminster's got the real McCoy: The oldest building of early city 
history still intact is named, appropriately enough, the McCoy-Hare House. This 
modest structure was the city's first drugstore, built in 1874 by the city's 
first physician, Dr. James McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy came to Westminster in 1873 at the invitation of the Rev. Lemuel P. 
Webber, who founded Westminster Colony in 1870. The pharmacy was operated by 
the doctor's sister, Martha (Mattie) McCoy, who continued working as the 
druggist for years after her brother moved to Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the building was expanded to serve as a home and in 1912 was 
purchased by Orel C. Hare and his bride, Marie Larter Hare. Marie Hare became a 
local educator of some renown. The school where she taught and was principal 
for 26 years was named after her. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her death, she donated the house, which stood on Westminster Boulevard, to 
the city to ensure its preservation. The city had its eye on the house at the 
same time -- for demolition, with the intention of extending Olive Street 
northward through the Hare property. 
</P>
<P>
The house, built of redwood in the board-and-batten fashion and put together 
with square nails, was moved to Heritage Park, next to the Chamber of Commerce 
on Hazard Avenue at Beach Boulevard, in conjunction with the city's part in the 
national bicentennial celebration in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The park boasts a variety of trees -- fig, fir, avocado, eucalyptus, pepper -- 
including the so-called Freedom Tree planted by the National League of Families 
of Americans Missing in Southeast Asia in 1973 to commemorate those missing in 
action in the Vietnam War. The Kiwanis Club built the flagpole rising in the 
field. The Camp Fire Girls built the brick well. The house has been restored to 
its original form -- that is, with the little pharmacy in one room and living 
quarters behind. On the shelves, bottles that once held medications are sealed 
with corks, as was the practice in the late 19th Century. A book full of 
prescriptions dating as far back as 1890 lies on the counter. Another volume 
has recipes for prescriptions, instructions on how to mix ingredients for the 
healing potions. 
</P>
<P>
The second room has been recast as a sitting room such as Mattie McCoy might 
have had beside her pharmacy. A hand-operated phonograph still works and plays 
a single song. A sewing machine sits by the window. 
</P>
<P>
Such remnants of the past are few in Orange County today, yet this neighborhood 
has two. The second, the Westminster Auditorium, at 7571 Westminster Blvd., was 
a Works Projects Administration effort (one of the few remaining in the county) 
completed in 1940 to replace a school damaged in the 1933 earthquake. A private 
developer, the Delma Corp., intending to build a 312-unit housing project for 
senior citizens on the former school site behind the auditorium in 1986, 
originally planned to raze the auditorium. But the City Council voted to keep 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
Now called the Westminster Cultural Arts Center, the two-story, beige stucco 
structure, which seats 625 and features a meeting room, is rented out for dance 
classes and Boy Scout functions and accommodates plays, meetings, movies, 
concerts and ceremonies. The neighborhood has acquired a mixed architectural 
complexion beyond those two historical sites. Its residential offerings are a 
mix of apartments, mobile homes and single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster Senior Apartments complex today wraps around the auditorium 
along Hoover Street and California Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Two mobile home parks are also on Hoover Street: At 21st Street, the Caravan 
Trailer Lodge shows trees rising over the retaining walls enclosing the area; 
another, the Westminster Mobile Estates, stands north of Suzi Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Modest single-family homes with front yards and lawns and flowers only 
occasionally have fences around them. One single-family home on Arizona Street 
at the corner of California Avenue suggests an enterprising inhabitant. A sign 
reads "Dorothy's Dolls and Stuffed Animals, Handmade Gifts," and the table set 
up in front of the garage offers two-foot-tall windmills, a wooden rocking 
horse and stuffed Easter bunnies. Next door, a row of cedar saplings is 
breaking ground. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood, once almost exclusively white and Latino, does not now seem 
that way to the casual visitor. Children playing in front yards, walking home 
from school or sitting in the shade to avoid the midday heat are mostly 
Southeast Asian. At least two cafes on Westminster Boulevard are Vietnamese. A 
local bakery is called Me Samoan. 
</P>
<P>
All seem signs of change in a neighborhood whose major icons celebrate 
preservation.

Permits for the construction of multiple-family housing units (duplexes, 
apartments, condominiums) opened stronger this year than 1988 or 1989. 
January's total of 600 such permits put 1990's first month 67% ahead of last 
year and 57% more than 1988. None of the last three years, however, have come 
close to the totals issued in January, 1986, and January, 1987. A major 
increase in permits for Irvine lead the increased activity.

FIVE-COUNTY COMPARISON

<P>
The increase in multi-family home permit activity in Orange County outpaced 
both the local five-county area and the state in January. Compared to January 
1989, the current year opened here with a 67% increase compared to 46% in the 
five counties and 27% statewide. Riverside and San Diego counties both had 
larger increases, while activity dropped in both Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties.

On the morning of Friday the 13th, Jim Slemons' spanking new home in Newport 
Beach was a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
It had no lawn, no walkway to the front door, no flagstones surrounding the 
back-yard pool. There was hardly a stick of furniture in its 
white-whiter-whitest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning there were 37 pickup trucks out front," said Slemons, a car and 
boat dealer. 
</P>
<P>
That night -- as luck would have it -- the custom-built, 10,000-square-foot 
house was ready for inspection, which is just what it got. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 of Slemons' friends drove to the place the owner called "the top of 
Newport" -- a slice of hilltop real estate in the gated Harbor Ridge section of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
There they walked up the newly laid gray stone path, past a toy black cat 
curled by the door -- the only Friday the 13th touch -- and into a party. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Slemons' employees -- tousle-haired young women dressed in black hot 
pants, spike-heeled pumps, white dress shirts and tux coats -- greeted guests. 
They proffered a guest book, poured glasses of champagne, snapped souvenir 
photos for their boss. 
</P>
<P>
"On a clear day," Slemons told one visitor, "I can see Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In the sunset mists of the 13th, the view from Slemons' vast windows was 
limited to the cube shapes of Fashion Island and a swath of shimmering sea. 
</P>
<P>
But there was much to see inside. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for example, a white grand player piano in one corner of the living 
room, plinking its own ghostly tunes. There were more than a dozen antique slot 
machines in a basement that also featured a fireplace, a pool table and an 
oak-shelved wine cellar (fully stocked). There was a cherry paneled study, with 
artfully arranged leather-bound books. 
</P>
<P>
A sandwiches-and-salads buffet was spread on the dining room table. Mariachis 
serenaded pool side. A fortuneteller read Tarot cards and tossed "astral dice" 
at a table near the self-possessed piano. 
</P>
<P>
On the host's arm was L.A. Gear tennis shoe model Donna Piccioni, a vision in 
turquoise Spandex. Piccioni said she also works as a marketing executive for a 
water bottling company. "And Jim (Slemons) hired me for the 1990 posters for 
his boat company," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among early arrivals was former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who parked his red 
convertible Mercedes with "MARS GUY" license plates right in front of Slemons' 
front door. (When his wife, Lois, arrived an hour later, she parked her red 
"MOON GAL"-plated Porsche right behind it.) 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Virginia Knott Bender and Paul Bender, Alice and Frank 
Mead, Renate and Bill Shafer, Linda and Warren Bauer, Jana and Ken Knapp, and 
Steve and Robin Marmor.

PLEDGE MADE BY COLISEUM MANAGERS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: MAYOR RELEASES LETTER PROMISING THAT "UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES" WILL 
THE FACILITY BE DEMOLISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A day after Oakland officials voted to scrap their deal with the Raiders, Mayor 
Tom Bradley on Wednesday released a written commitment from the private 
managers of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that "under no circumstances" 
will the facility be demolished and that any renovation project will retain the 
exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
The private managers, Spectacor Management Group and MCA Inc., also said any 
renovation project will be the subject of an environmental impact report and 
that "any changes . . . will be accomplished in a way that is consistent with 
the historic and architectural significance of the structure." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, at a press conference at which he expressed hope that an agreement 
keeping the Raiders football team in Los Angeles could now be reached "in all 
haste" in the wake of the collapse of their Oakland deal, said he had 
negotiated the terms of the letter from Don C. Webb, a senior vice president of 
Spectacor. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, saying he wrote on behalf of both Spectacor and MCA, specifically pledged 
that "the exterior walls of the Coliseum, including the peristyle end, will be 
incorporated into any design of a renovated Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"A new entrance at the western end of the Coliseum may be used which will 
conform to the Coliseum's exterior," he wrote. "It should be noted that this 
small section of the exterior wall has already been altered during previous 
renovation and modernization efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Webb is a third-ranking negotiator for Spectacor in talks with the Raiders, 
behind the board chairman of the firm, Ed Snider, and its president, Tony 
Tavaras. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the private managers had told him no schematic drawings have yet 
been prepared for the renovation project and therefore there is nothing to be 
made public. This contrasted with statements made a month ago by one private 
management representative that some preliminary schematics had been prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he is convinced that assurances that the Coliseum's historic 
features will be maintained are now solid enough to make "moot" the need for 
legislation authored by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) that would 
require a Los Angeles countywide vote before any demolition or other major 
alteration of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said later, however, that he remains to be persuaded, even after a talk 
with Bradley, that his bill is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
He called the language in the Webb letter "vague in some paragraphs" and said 
he wants direct assurances from the private managers before deciding whether to 
drop his bill. He said it now commands decisive support in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservationist organization, said 
at Bradley's news conference they too believe that it is too early to abandon 
the legislation, which was approved Tuesday by an Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he is devoted to preservation of the Coliseum, the only stadium in 
the world to host two of the modern Olympic Games and a national and state 
historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Coliseum needs renovation and repair to remain Southern California's 
premier sports facility through the 21st Century," the mayor said. "The 
agreement I have reached assures that this work can be completed without 
disturbing the historic components of our stadium. Our historic jewel will be 
preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the private managers had talked of a plan to demolish all but the 
eastern peristyle end of the Coliseum and rebuild the rest. Polls indicated a 
majority of local voters were opposed to such a project. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Raiders, Bradley said he has been in contact with team owner Al 
Davis and planned to speak to him in the wake of the officially expressed 
intention of the Oakland City Council on Tuesday night to formally scrap that 
city's deal to return the Raiders to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland officials said they will seek new negotiations with the Raiders on 
the basis of no municipal guarantees to the team. In the deal to be scrapped, 
the city of Oakland and Alameda County had pledged $486 million in such 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Raider negotiator Jack Brooks, however, said he had great doubts whether Davis 
will be prepared to negotiate on the new terms. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley on Wednesday emphasized that in Los Angeles "not a dime" of municipal 
or county money will be committed in the form of guarantees to the Raiders. He 
acknowledged that the Coliseum Commission is ready to make a $15-million 
long-term loan to facilitate the deal, but he noted that these funds came out 
of a damage suit the Coliseum and the Raiders had won against the National 
Football League for impeding the Raiders' move from Oakland in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Matthew Grossman said, meanwhile, that with the lapse of 
the Oakland deal, "I am hopeful that Spectacor will be able to conclude the 
negotiations with (Davis) and enter into a new lease for the Raiders to play in 
the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
However, Grossman agreed that since no work could likely start until the 
conclusion of the 1990 season, there are several months to play around with and 
negotiations might not be concluded speedily. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, under their present lease, are committed to playing in the 
Coliseum through the 1992 season.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL DELAYS DECISION ON SUING BROOKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delaying a decision on whether to sue Bishop H.H. Brookins, the Los Angeles 
City Council on Wednesday directed the city attorney's office to negotiate with 
Brookins in a dispute over $48,000 he may owe the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council gave the order during a closed session and continued the matter 
until May 11, Councilman Robert Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is $48,000 in Community Development Department funds paid to a 
Brookins organization to rent a building that Brookins owned. 
</P>
<P>
The CDD has concluded that the money is owed to the city because Brookins had a 
conflict of interest in his dual role as a landlord who collected city rent for 
his property while serving as the head of a poverty program located in the 
building.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NOW BLASTS REINER FOR NOT CHARGING ABORTION 
FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blasting Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for not filing felony 
charges against the leaders of an anti-abortion rally last weekend, the leader 
of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women said 
Wednesday that Reiner is "failing miserably" on issues of abortion rights and 
family support. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of his office should have been to shut down those people," said local 
NOW President Tammy Bruce, speaking at a news conference to reaffirm the 
group's support for Reiner's opponent in the Democratic state attorney 
general's race, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Reiner's office referred a case against two Operation Rescue 
leaders to the city attorney's office, which Tuesday filed misdemeanor charges 
of conspiracy to obstruct justice against the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Reiner, said felony charges were not filed 
because of the overwhelming likelihood that a court would not sentence the 
protesters to state prison.

FORMER LAX POLICE OFFICER PLEADS NO CONTEST IN SEX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Los Angeles International Airport police officer pleaded no contest 
Wednesday to charges that he sexually assaulted two women in separate incidents 
while he patrolled the airport in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Julian Lopez, 32, is expected to receive a two-year prison sentence when 
he returns on June 18 to Los Angeles Superior Court, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Yochelson. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was hired by the airport police department, which patrols LAX, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred on May 22, 1988, when Lopez approached a teen-age 
couple who sat in a parked car after their high school prom watching jets take 
off, Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez told the man to remain in the car while he searched the 18-year-old woman 
in his patrol car. The teen-ager testified at a preliminary hearing that Lopez 
fondled her, Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8, 1988, Lopez again approached a young couple in a car and told the 
man to stay put while he brought the woman to his patrol car. Lopez handcuffed 
the 21-year-old woman and forced her to perform a sex act, Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman identified Lopez a few hours later at the airport police 
headquarters. Authorities showed the victim in the first case Lopez's picture 
and she also identified him as her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was fired after his arrest. He remains free on $15,000 bail pending 
sentencing.

TWO KILLED, TWO INJURED IN COLLISION; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: A GIANT LOADING RAMP ON THE GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY CAUSES CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two people were killed and two others were critically injured when a car 
collided with a truck on the Golden State Freeway after both tried to avoid 
hitting a large metal object early Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Rodriguez Sierra, 39, and her husband, Guillermo Cardenas Sierra, 28, of 
Los Angeles, were pronounced dead at the scene, said Pat Marek, spokesman for 
the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred just before 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes of the freeway, 
south of the Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers said the accident was caused by a 
2,000-pound ramp -- used to load heavy equipment onto trucks -- that apparently 
had fallen onto the road from another vehicle. The driver of that vehicle was 
being sought. 
</P>
<P>
The car carrying the victims struck the ramp and began to spin clockwise and to 
the right, said Officer Vince Zambrana. The truck was traveling behind the car 
and also hit the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The truck veered to the right, then broadsided the car, pushing it 400 to 500 
feet north, Zambrana said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the collision left the car jammed underneath the truck, Marek 
said. Firefighters worked for 45 minutes to free two surviving passengers from 
the wreckage using the "Jaws of Life." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas McNeal, 50, and Elia Acosta, 30, were listed in critical condition at 
County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.

<P>
A LANDMARK FOOTHILL CARWASH TOTTERS IN MIDST OF A BUREAUCRATIC WEB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Twenty-two years ago, the Foothill Car Wash in La Canada Flintridge made 
environmental history when it became the first carwash in Los Angeles County to 
recycle 85% of its water. 
</P>
<P>
But today the carwash is an environmental dinosaur. Regulators say it is the 
last carwash in the Los Angeles area to dump its waste water down a storm 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
Its owner, Marvin Berkman, has spent years trying to shed this distinction by 
hooking up to a sewer line that runs 60 feet in front of his business. But a 
nasty rift between La Canada Flintridge and neighboring Glendale has kept him 
out of the sewer and put his business in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're literally surrounded by sewers that we can't get into -- north, east, 
south and west," Berkman said. "We're a pawn in a political dispute." 
</P>
<P>
State water quality officials have ordered him to stop disposing of waste water 
in the storm drain by June 1. By a quirk of local history, La Canada Flintridge 
has no control over the sewer line in front of Berkman's carwash, and Glendale 
officials, who do, told him last week that they will not help. 
</P>
<P>
Unless he can break the political logjam, Berkman said his carwash may have to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
And this at a time when conservation officials mindful of Southern California's 
four-year drought are urging residents not to wash cars in their driveways. The 
closure of Berkman's business would leave the foothill area between Pasadena 
and Sunland without a professional carwash. 
</P>
<P>
"If they put us out of business, they're not going to help stop pollution 
because more people are going to wash cars in their driveways, where the runoff 
goes into the storm drains or into the ground," Berkman said. "We're going to 
aggravate the drought situation, and it's not going to do anything for the 
ecology." 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say a carwash with recycling equipment uses 10 to 15 gallons 
of fresh water per car, compared to more than 100 gallons used in a typical 
driveway washing. 
</P>
<P>
Berkman, 60, and his wife Sheila have owned the Foothill Car Wash for 15 years. 
It employs 35 people, and its floral landscaping has won three awards from the 
La Canada Valley Beautiful Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like an institution," said Diming Djang, a doctor and a 15-year 
customer of the carwash. "It's a very significant part of the community. Marv 
does a good job. It's always busy." 
</P>
<P>
Another long-time customer, Norma White of La Canada Flintridge, added: "There 
isn't another one close by. I'd really hate to see it close." 
</P>
<P>
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, which oversees most of Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties, has ordered the Berkmans by June 1 to stop 
sending their waste water down a nearby storm drain because it contains too 
many impurities, including detergent, oil and grease. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about what you go to a carwash to take off," explained David 
Gildersleeve, chief of the board's regulatory section. "Most carwashes -- in 
fact, all carwashes -- have gone to the sewers because they can't meet our 
(storm drain) requirements. Mr. Berkman has a problem. Because of institutional 
constraints, he can't get into a sewer." 
</P>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge, an affluent foothill community of 23,000, is one of the 
last urban areas in the county that does not have a trunk line sewer system. At 
least 90% of the city's 8,000 households rely on private septic tanks, leach 
lines and drain fields for sewage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
For three decades, most residents have opposed the installation of sewers, 
fearing it would trigger an unwanted development boom. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the water quality board, Berkman has lobbied for 
construction of a sewer in the commercial area where his carwash is located. An 
assessment district was proposed, but most property owners shied away because 
of soaring cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, La Canada Flintridge finally agreed to buy sewer capacity rights 
from Glendale, a move that would allow Berkman and nearby property owners to 
connect with a sewer line under Glendale's control. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, the Glendale City Council rejected the plan, partly because of a 
longstanding belief that La Canada Flintridge should build a citywide sewer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why we should give them piecemeal help," Glendale Councilwoman 
Ginger Bremberg said. "I feel very strongly that they should not remain on 
septic tanks. Where I live, I can smell them all summer." 
</P>
<P>
Berkman plans to ask the water quality board for another extension, but he 
acknowledges that, after eight years, the board's patience is wearing thin. He 
also hopes Glendale officials will reconsider their decision to bar him from 
the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
Berkman says the situation has caused him to have second thoughts about 
preparing his son Steven, a 21-year-old college junior, to take over the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We told him, 'We don't know if there will be a business for you to come in 
to,' " Berkman said. " 'So you better think of other alternatives, just in 
case.' "

DOCTOR FACES CHARGES OF MAKING PATIENTS 'JUNKIES' 
</P>

A Newhall physician has been arrested on charges that she got her patients 
addicted to painkillers and wrote prescriptions that enabled one patient to buy 
up to 900 codeine pills in one month, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sandra Soho, who was Dr. Stanley Soho until a 1986 sex-change operation, 
was arrested Tuesday and charged with 10 felony counts of illegally furnishing 
restricted substances -- prescription painkillers -- to patients who 
subsequently became addicted. 
</P>
<P>
She had purchased the practice of Dr. Milos Klvana, a home-birthing advocate 
who was arrested in 1986 on charges that he killed eight infants and a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Soho could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A receptionist in her office 
said the doctor had planned for weeks to be out of the office Wednesday for 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone said investigators found no evidence that 
Soho received kickbacks from pharmacies for the prescriptions, but said she 
profited from the $25 consultation fee she charged patients for each visit. 
</P>
<P>
"She was turning these people into prescription-drug junkies by prescribing 
them incredible numbers of pills," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her patients came to Soho's office with legitimate medical problems but 
became addicts after following her advice, Stone said. She conducted only a 
minimal exam before writing prescriptions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no evidence that patients were reselling the drugs for their 
own profit and said some are now experiencing withdrawal symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Soho has practiced in the Newhall offices of Klvana, the 
obstetrician who was sentenced in February to 53-years-to-life in prison for 
nine counts of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Soho, a 1967 graduate of the University of Oregon Health Sciences School of 
Medicine, was hired by Klvana's wife to keep her husband's medical practice 
alive after his arrest in October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Vicky Boone, an analyst for the Medical Board of California, said Soho was 
prohibited from practicing medicine from 1981 until 1984 after the physician 
failed repeated oral examinations. 
</P>
<P>
The Medical Board in 1981 required that Soho take the exam after investigators 
found that the doctor had abandoned patients in hospitals and nursing homes and 
had falsified medical records and death certificates, Boone said. Medical 
regulators at the time had found Soho's professional conduct "grossly 
incompetent . . . dishonest and corrupt," according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1984, Soho passed the exam and was placed on five-year probation, Boone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Sanders, regional director of the state medical board, said Soho's 
physician's license could be revoked if she is convicted of the charges pending 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanders said Soho, who is free on $50,000 bail, may continue to practice 
medicine until the board concludes its administrative proceedings, unless state 
officials decide to seek a court order restraining her from seeing patients. 
</P>
<P>
"The board doesn't have authority for interim suspension of a license. We would 
have to go to a magistrate and request a temporary restraining order, and I 
don't know if we are going to do that or not," Sanders said.

SANTA ANA MAN SHOT BY OFFICER

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old man who was shot by a police officer after allegedly pointing a 
gun at the officer was in stable condition this morning at Western Medical 
Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Orejel of Santa Ana was shot in the chest and leg and also suffered 
scratches from a police dog during the incident that occurred about 8 p.m. at 
Madison Park in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Orejel was taken into custody on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with 
a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Residents called police just before 8 p.m. Wednesday to complain about a man 
firing a gun in the nearby park, said Sgt. Dick Faust. Two officers responded 
and when they confronted Orejel, the suspect allegedly pointed a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic Beretta handgun at one of the officers. As the second officer 
approached, the suspect turned and pointed the weapon in his direction. The 
second officer then fired "several" shots at Orejel. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then tried to flee on foot but was captured a few blocks away with 
the help of a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the officers involved in the incident were not released. Faust 
said the officer who fired the shots will probably be placed on a three-day 
administrative assignment, which is customary in shooting cases.

Three men were arrested and more than $227,000 in cash was seized in Valencia 
when the suspects bought cocaine from undercover investigators, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested William Robert Work, 52, of Bellingham, Wash.; Kevin 
Barchiesi, a 35-year-old transient, and Samuel Vaisfeld, 23, of Chatsworth on 
suspicion of possession of cocaine for sale, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were arrested at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday after meeting with 
undercover deputies in a restaurant parking lot on the Magic Mountain Parkway, 
just off the Golden State Freeway, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests came after a weeklong investigation by undercover deputies, who 
arranged to sell 13 kilograms of cocaine to the three men, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men brought $227,000 in cash with them to the parking lot meeting and 
were arrested when they exchanged the money for cocaine, Estrada said. The 
drugs sold by the deputies had previously been evidence in an unrelated 
narcotics case. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrests, the deputies found a loaded handgun in Work's car, Estrada 
said. The three men are being held in lieu of $1 million bail apiece at the 
sheriff's Santa Clarita Valley station jail.

BUSH'S $300-BILLION DEFENSE PLAN SLASHED BY HOUSE PANEL

President Bush's plans for nearly $300 billion in defense spending next year 
came under attack today on Capitol Hill as the House Budget Committee passed 21 
to 14 a $1.24-trillion Democratic-written budget that slashed $8 billion from 
the President's plan for Pentagon spending. 
</P>
<P>
The full House is scheduled next week to debate the Democratic proposal to 
shift the Pentagon money to domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's action represented the fullest statement of budget priorities 
by Congress' majority Democrats since the Warsaw Pact disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's budget virtually ignored the opportunities presented by the 
dramatic changes taking place in the world," committee Chairman Leon Panetta 
(D-Carmel Valley) said. "This budget meets that challenge head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to restore the traditional peacetime priorities of our nation 
at a time when we are faced with tremendous economic challenges at home and 
abroad," Panetta said.

KIDNAPERS DELAY RELEASE OF HOSTAGE, BLAME U.S.

Pro-Iranian kidnappers said today they have postponed the release of an 
American hostage because the United States failed to meet their demand to send 
a senior State Department official to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in an Arabic-language statement delivered by Islamic 
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine to the independent Beirut newspaper An 
Nahar and a Western news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture of Robert 
Polhill, one of U.S. educators held by the group since Jan. 24, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers said on Wednesday that they were freeing one of the three 
American educators they are holding within 24 hours, or by Friday evening. The 
other two are Jesse Turner and Alann Steen. 
</P>
<P>
The group said at the time that it was acting in response to requests from Iran 
and Syria, whose leaders have encouraged an end to the hostage crisis, and 
implied that some sort of exchange was involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had demanded that John Kelly, 
U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, fly to Damascus "to 
coordinate some final steps" leading to the release. 
</P>
<P>
It did not specify what they expect of Kelly, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon 
from 1983 to 1988. He was in Bonn, West Germany, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III cautiously welcomed the reports but said 
Kelly had no plans to fly to the Middle East "at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
"As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had been under way on 
a basis that they would be concluded and finalized. But Kelly's failure to 
respond has so far frustrated the release, which made us postpone this 
operation until the picture is cleared," today's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, White House spoesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration 
did not want to given any appearances of negotating with terrorists for a 
hostage's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
But the State Department today dispatched a reception team to Wiesbaden, West 
Germany, "where they have the medical facilities to receive any hostage that 
might be released," Fitzwater said.

405 CRASH KILLS DRIVER OF VAN, ROAD WORKER

A Mission Viejo man plowed through a marked Caltrans work area early this 
morning, slamming his van into a highway maintenance truck, killing himself and 
a freeway worker on the southbound 405 Freeway in Irvine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Eularlio Castillo, 38, and Kevin Smith, 25, of Lancaster, who was 
employed by a company on contract with Caltrans, were pronounced dead at the 
scene, said California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
A second worker, Robert Ornales, 25, of La Puente, was also injured in the 
crash. He is in fair condition with back injuries at a Mission Viejo hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 12:10 a.m. as Smith and a crew were repainting white 
stripes and replacing reflective lane markers on the southbound San Diego 
Freeway near Irvine Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
At speeds in excess of 80 m.p.h., Castillo apparently drove through a barrier 
of cones onto the closed portion of the freeway, slamming into the back of a 
flatbed truck carrying Smith and one other worker, Johnson said.

SOVIETS SLASH NATURAL GAS TO LITHUANIA;

INDEPENDENCE: CUTOFF LEAVES THE COUNTRY WITH ONLY 16% OF THE FUEL IT NEEDS. THE

The Kremlin sharply curtailed supplies of natural gas to Lithuania today, hours 
after it halted the flow of crude oil to the republic for refusing to scrap 
laws promoting independence, Lithuanian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said Moscow's economic embargo is 
tantamount to it recognizing his Baltic republic's independence. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet energy official, however, said the Lithuanians got what they deserved 
for defying President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who on Friday threatened to cut off 
supplies unless they rescinded their independence-oriented laws. 
</P>
<P>
A Lithuanian government spokesman appealed over Vilnius Radio today for fuel 
conservation, "and maybe we will not be intimidated by these sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
The flow of natural gas to Lithuania was shut off in three pipelines -- two 
from Latvia and one from Minsk in Byelorussia -- reducing supplies to Lithuania 
by more than 80%, Lithuanian lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth pipeline from Slonim in Byelorussia that supplies Lithuania continued 
to provide 3.5 million cubic meters of gas to the republic, guaranteeing "a 
normal supply of gas for residents and communal domestic use," parliamentary 
officials quoted the Byelorussian gas concern's telegram as saying. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Lithuania with only 16% of the gas it needs per day. 
</P>
<P>
Juozas Martusevicius, a Lithuanian electrical official, said Moscow officials 
guaranteed that enough natural gas would be supplied to keep Lithuania's 
Elektrenai power plant functioning. The plant also serves customers in the 
neighboring Russian republic territory of Kaliningrad. 
</P>
<P>
As the events in Lithuania unfolded, Gorbachev met in the Kremlin today with 
leaders of Latvia and Estonia and offered concessions and made threats in an 
effort to keep them in the Soviet Union, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev offered both republics "special status" in the Soviet Union if they 
drop their attempts to follow Lithuania into independence, said Raymond 
Lochmelis of the Latvian Popular Front and other officials present.

The Vatican and Czechoslovakia restored diplomatic relations today in a move 
that expands the church's influence in the former Communist-dominated countries 
of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the resumption of ties after 40 years came two days before 
Pope John Paul II begins a historic visit to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia, where the Roman Catholic Church was severely repressed for 
decades, is the latest in a series of Warsaw Pact countries to renew ties with 
the Vatican. The Pope's native Poland re-established diplomatic relations last 
year, followed by Hungary in February. A month ago, the Vatican and the Soviet 
Union established official ties for the first time since the Russian Revolution 
although they fall short of full diplomatic relations.

U.S. HALTS DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT-RANGE MISSILES

With East-West tensions in decline, the Bush Administration is postponing 
indefinitely the development of new short-range nuclear missiles that were to 
be based in West Germany, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 88 new launchers, 36 of which were to be controlled by the United States 
and the others by West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, were designed for 
targeting on East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
They would have been capable of launching about 1,600 missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative U.S. goal had been to begin deploying the missiles in 1995 to 
replace the current mixture of nuclear-armed and conventional Lance missiles 
with an all-nuclear force and an expanded range. 
</P>
<P>
But East Germany is rapidly moving out of the Soviet orbit and preparing for 
union with West Germany. It is no longer perceived as a threat to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. 
</P>
<P>
The current arsenal of Lances will remain in West Germany. About 700 carry 
nuclear warheads and have a range of about 75 miles. The 900 or so non-nuclear 
missiles in the arsenal are designed to hit targets within 45 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The new launchers were intended to have a range of about 280 miles, just below 
the level of intermediate-range nuclear missiles that were banned in a 
U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Congress appropriated $32 million last year to develop the new Lance missiles. 
The Pentagon has requested $112 million for this year. Overall, the program 
would have cost more than $1 billion, Dunbar Lockwood of the private Arms 
Control Assn. estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the future of the Lance was a 
decision for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the Army Missiles Command had put a hold on plans to 
issue a formal request for contractors' proposals for building the new weapons.

The Bush Administration today announced plans to withdraw up to 15,000 U.S. 
troops from Asia within three years and more later, turning the lead defense 
role in South Korea over to Korean forces by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said the troop levels will be cut 
cautiously to avoid sending "a false and dangerous signal," particularly to 
North Korea, of U.S. withdrawal from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfowitz told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Administration 
plans to cut 7,000 U.S. troops from the 44,400 in South Korea over the next 
three years, 5,000 to 6,000 from the 50,000 in Japan and 2,000 from the 14,800 
in the Philippines.

Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said today the Pentagon should plan on cutting European 
troop levels by up to two-thirds in five years and suggested the Navy think 
about making do with as few as 10 aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a major 
address laying out his ideas about how U.S. forces should be reorganized in 
view of the reduced threat, also proposed a greater reliance on reserve forces 
and suggested informal military cooperation with France. 
</P>
<P>
And Nunn, who in a few days will announce his proposals to reduce the 
Administration's fiscal 1991 defense budget, said cuts proposed by House 
Democratic leaders are too deep, but are "within the realm of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 310,000 troops in Europe, mostly in West Germany, and 
the United States has proposed going down to 225,000 in all of Europe, with 
195,000 in the central area. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Administration's view that 195,000 U.S. troops in central Europe 
is a 'floor' below which the United States cannot reduce, that is not the right 
assumption," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we must begin planning for a significantly lower level in the years 
ahead. I agree with former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger that we 
should start planning on a residual force in Europe on the order of 75,000 to 
100,000 troops within five years." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, noting pressures for housing and other services in Germany and calls for 
lower troop levels there, added later to reporters, "I believe the question 
will be whether that may be too many for the Germans in three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
France long ago pulled its military forces out of NATO, preferring to chart its 
own military course in Europe, but recently has started joint exercises with 
Britain and even West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he is not seeking a formal arrangement with France, but asked, "Why 
can't the French and the Americans have occasional exercises involving French 
ports and airfields?"

BABY PILLOWS RECALLED AFTER 19 INFANTS SUFFOCATE

Manufacturers are recalling more than 600,000 infant pillows and cushions 
linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 infants, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we are announcing that nine of the 10 firms that made these cushions 
have agreed to recall their products from the public," Jacqueline Jones-Smith, 
chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
One firm whose pillows were involved with "more than several deaths" is 
resisting the call and could face legal action, a commission official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't buy them. Don't use them," Terry Rogers, compliance officer of the CPSC, 
advised parents during a news conference on the recall. The agency staff 
"believes these products clearly are dangerous," said David Schmeltzer of the 
CPSC. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen children, age 3 months or younger, have been "found dead, lying 
stomach-down on one of these cushions" since September, 1987, according to the 
commission.. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staffers explained that the pillows are dangerous because they are 
so soft they can conform to a baby's face. Because infants often are unable to 
roll over by themselves, they can suffocate if they are placed face down. 
</P>
<P>
The recall involves 627,825 small pillows or cushions filled with plastic foam 
beads. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled are 467,000 Mothers Helper cushions made by Hollander Home Fashions in 
Newark, N.J.; 110,000 Gold Bug Support Sacks made by Gold Inc. of Denver; 
35,700 Cozy Cushions made by Pinky Baby Products of Houston; 12,000 Cozy Baby 
pillows manufactured by Cozy Baby Products of Mt. Vernon, N.Y.; 3,000 Baby 
Minder cushions made by The Fourth Little Pig of San Anselmo, Calif., and 125 
Baby Sak pillows made by Baby Sak of Pembroke Pines, Fla.

PHILLIPS FACES BLAST FINE OF $5.7 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY: NATURAL GAS COMPANY AND ENGINEERING FIRM CHARGED WITH 
WILLFUL VIOLATIONS IN TEXAS EXPLOSION FATAL TO 23.

<P>
The government proposed a $5.7-million fine today against Phillips 66 Natural 
Gas Co. for alleged safety violations in connection with last year's explosion 
at a Texas chemical plant that killed 23 people. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was cited for 575 willful and serious safety violations at its Houston 
Chemical Complex, where an Oct. 23 blast killed 23 workers and injured 130 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in announcing the 
second-largest proposed penalty against a company for a single inspection, also 
proposed a $730,000 fine against a contractor, Fish Engineering &amp; 
Construction Inc., for 193 alleged willful and serious violations. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips and Fish have 15 days to contest the fines. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time has Phillips ever compromised the safety of its employees," the 
company said in a statement. "Based on preliminary information, we do plan to 
contest a number of the citations and we do take issue with OSHA characterizing 
any of the violations as willful acts." 
</P>
<P>
In its investigation of the blast, OSHA uncovered internal Phillips documents 
that called for corrective action but "were largely ignored," Labor Secretary 
Elizabeth Hanford Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy is magnified by the clear evidence that this explosion was 
avoidable had recognized safety procedures been followed," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard Scannell, who heads OSHA, said an 
investigation showed that four highly flammable gases escaped from an open 
valve, forming a huge vapor cloud that traveled through the plant within 
seconds because of high pressure. A series of explosions occurred after the 
cloud came in contact with an ignition source. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Phillips' own procedures as well as standard industry practice, 
there was no backup protection such as a double valve to protect against valve 
failure or an untimely valve opening, Scannell said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged "willful" violations included failures to prevent the uncontrolled 
release of flammable vapors and provide adequate fire protection. Employees 
were not familiar with the plant alarm system or respiratory protection, OSHA 
said in citing Phillips and Fish for "serious" violations. 
</P>
<P>
The government defines willful violations as those committed with an 
intentional disregard of federal safety laws. A serious violation is one in 
which there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm 
could result, and the employer knew or should have known of the hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fine ever sought by OSHA was proposed last November, when the 
government said it was seeking a $7.3-million fine from USX Corp. for 2,000 
alleged safety violations at two steel plants, one near Pittsburgh, Pa., and 
the other on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River.

Perrier water will be back on the shelves soon, but it won't have the same 
sparkle -- at least not on the label. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has ruled that the mineral water's claim to be 
"naturally sparkling" is false and ordered the American distributor to remove 
the phrase from bottles by July 30. 
</P>
<P>
"The water comes out of the ground and the carbonation is added," Bob Crowell, 
compliance officer in the FDA's Boston district office, said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America Inc., in Greenwich, 
Conn., said the company believes that its description is accurate but will obey 
the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to make the change because we want to be responsible to the 
government and consumers," Lazgin said. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier is expected to be back on the shelves in the United States next week. 
</P>
<P>
Source Perrier S.A. of France began a worldwide recall of its water in February 
after trace amounts of the carcinogen benzene were discovered in some bottles. 
The uproar revealed that Source Perrier not only mechanically added gas to its 
water but also that the gas contained numerous impurities that had to be 
removed.

Waldenbooks is asking readers for help against a group that threatens to 
boycott the bookstore chain for selling Playboy and Penthouse magazines. 
</P>
<P>
In full-page advertisements to appear in 32 newspapers Monday, Waldenbooks 
calls on readers to voice support for the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The ad says constitutional freedoms are at risk if those who try to censor 
certain publications are allowed to go unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which will be accompanied by signs at Waldenbooks' stores, is paid for 
by the chain, although the company will accept donations from other booksellers 
to cover its costs. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the ad is Waldenbooks or its adversary, the American Family Assn., 
mentioned. AFA has picketed Waldenbooks in Florida and threatened to boycott 
its stores. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement is to appear in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, 
the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, the Christian Science Monitor and 27 other 
daily newspapers around the country.

The rap group 2 Live Crew performed before hundreds of fans early today without 
incident despite threats by a prosecutor to have the musicians arrested on 
obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
The band began its 90-minute concert shortly after midnight, opening with a 
song called "Martinez Rap," about Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's campaign 
against explicit lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
The nightclub Central City was filled to its 1,500-person capacity at $12.50 a 
ticket for the one-night stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Just business as usual. Arrests? Not by this department," said a duty officer 
at Gainesville police headquarters who asked not to be named. "This whole 
thing, we understand, was being publicized by the state attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Len Register had called some of 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit 
songs "the most filthy thing I've ever encountered." He threatened to have the 
band arrested if they played uncensored versions of songs such as "Me So 
Horny," and "Move Somethin," which has lyrics referring to sadomasochistic sex 
and violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
Register's office said this morning that he was in meetings and would not be 
available for comment until later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Sadie Darnell said before the concert that police received 
no special orders from the state attorney's office. "I don't feel this issue is 
over," though, she said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
No Alachua County sheriff's officers were sent to the nightclub either, clerk 
Lashaun Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials in some Florida counties have banned some 2 Live Crew albums, 
especially one called "As Nasty As They Wanna Be." Legislatures in several 
states also have begun considering mandatory record labeling acts because of 
the group's material. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami-based group is led by Luther (Luke Skywalker) Campbell. Members are 
David (Mr. Mixx) Hobbs, Chris (Fresh Ice Kid) Won Wong and Mark (Brother 
Marquis) Ross.

Hollywood's plan to send Bugs Bunny and his friends into the fight against 
drugs won applause from Congress today but also a request for more than just 
the cartoon special set to air on national television Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this doesn't devolve into a mere self-promotion activity in which we 
finally hear from Hollywood and this is the last shot," said Rep. John Conyers 
Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
"Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change anybody's mind who's 
going to use drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee watched a sample of the 30-minute 
special, "Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue" and applauded the effort to reach 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"The most powerful weapon that we know in politics is the cartoon and we hope 
that the cartoon will be the most powerful tool to educate our children," said 
committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
The program, a unique collaboration of animation studios, tells the story of 
Michael, a 14-year-old drug abuser who is saved with help from Bugs Bunny, the 
Chipmunks, Daffy Duck, Garfield, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss 
Piggy, Slimer, the Smurfs, Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles' Michelangelo and 
Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
He is also saved from Smoke, a sinister, drug-pushing apparition whose voice

Asked about long-range plans, Disney Studios President Richard Frank said the

really haven't had time to sit down and plan other ones."

<P>
Actually, only 15 minutes of the production were shown to the lawmakers and 
some of the music as well as all of the sound effects were missing. "What 
you're going to see is minus those embellishments," Disney explained.

<P>
"I know what I'm going to be doing Saturday morning," Biden said after the

Rembrandt's "Night Watch" masterpiece will go back on display May 1, less than 
one month after being sprayed with sulfuric acid by a man believed to be 
mentally disturbed, officials said today. No extra security will be introduced 
to protect the painting, despite the fact the April 6 attack was the third 
against the Rembrandt this century, said a museum spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The 1642 painting will be returned to its customary center spot in the main 
gallery. A protective veneer layer prevented any damage to the work of art. In 
1975, a Dutch schoolmaster claiming to be on a divine mission slashed the 
painting with a knife. He was sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he 
committed suicide. During World War I, a jobless shoemaker slashed the canvas 
to protest his inability to find work.

<P>
Two-time world champion hurdler Greg Foster has been suspended from competition 
for three months for testing positive for substances commonly found in 
over-the-counter cold medications. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Congress said today that Foster was tested at the Sunkist 
Invitational indoor meet in Los Angeles on Jan. 19 and tested positive for 
pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and pheynylpropanolamine, substances banned by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
A three-member panel of TAC's Drug Control Review Board will hear an appeal of 
the suspension. If the appeal is denied, Foster would be ineligible to compete 
in national or international meets until June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 31, a former UCLA runner from Chino Hills won the world outdoor titles 
in the 110-meter hurdles in 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He was the 1984 Olympic silver medalist.

Assistant coach Garry Lariviere was fired today by the Toronto Maple Leafs.

The team said Lariviere will not be re-signed and will be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Garry did an excellent job . . . but we felt that it was time for a change," 
General Manger Floyd Smith said. "By announcing this change at this time, we

Lariviere, 34, joined the Toronto organization in 1985 as a playing assistant

Brophy replaced Dan Maloney as the Maple Leafs' coach for the 1986-87 season, 
Lariviere moved up as an assistant.

<P>
VOLLEYBALL: LOYOLA COACH MIKE NORMAND GAVE UP $80,000 IN SALARY TO LEAD THE 
LIONS TO THE TOP IN A CONFERENCE OF POWERHOUSE TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Normand, Loyola Marymount's volleyball coach, is always blunt. He calls 
himself a straight-ahead guy who doesn't like the spotlight and hates the 
publicity that often comes with success in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in his cubicle office at Loyola, he tried desperately to 
focus on his team rather than himself. He leaned in a chair, clad in a white 
tank top that revealed well-defined biceps and a pair of blue shorts that 
exposed muscular legs, and said: "I'd rather you write something on my players 
and not me." 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, however, Normand's successful athletic and coaching career 
has made it impossible for him to avoid the limelight. As a coach, the former 
UCLA all-American outside hitter has triumphed at practically every level: 
junior college, four-year university and age-group clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, in his second year at the helm of a small-time program in a big-time 
league, Normand can't avoid recognition. Last year he led the Loyola men to 
their best record ever (4-16) in the tough Western Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Assn., and this season he topped that with the best mark in school history 
(9-10) and a No. 8 national ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into the top 10 was a difficult feat for little Loyola, since the 
12-member WIVA includes powerhouses such as UCLA, USC and Hawaii. Most teams in 
the league are fully funded, which means having five scholarships and a 
full-time coach. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola has neither. The Lions have only two full scholarships and a part-time 
coach who took a huge pay cut because he believes that the program can be 
turned around. 
</P>
<P>
Normand left an assistant coaching position at UCLA and a teaching job at 
Crozier Junior High in Inglewood to take over at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up $80,000 of money to work for less than $20,000," Normand said. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old coach says Loyola has many obstacles to overcome before it can 
be a contender in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. He hopes to change 
that with the help of Athletic Director Brian Quinn, a strong supporter of 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"In real life," Normand said, "to be successful at a Division I college in any 
athletic event, the No. 1 thing you need is a good coach. The No. 2 thing is 
that it has to be fully funded. Then you have to have the ability to get an 
athlete into the school and keep the kid in school. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have all that, you can win it all, or at least you have a chance to 
win it all. We've proven that in basketball. It's fully funded and we made it 
to the Sweet 16. Same with baseball. It's fully funded and we're in the top 
20." 
</P>
<P>
Normand, whose budget won't spring for an assistant, says he'll do his best 
with what he has. He's determined not to let insufficient funds get in the way 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go out there and beat the bushes," he said, waving his index finger, "but 
I'm going to win the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
For now, that sounds far-fetched, but Loyola seems to be headed in the right 
direction. The much-improved Lions have defeated several higher-ranked teams 
this season like crosstown rival Pepperdine, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, San 
Diego State and Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
"He does a real good job," said Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy, who has led the 
Waves to two national titles. "He's a real plus, and he's made a great impact 
on the team over there. The kids look real strong and they look 
well-conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy, who coached the U.S. men to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, played 
at Pepperdine when Normand played at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real good in all skills as a player," Dunphy said. "I really respect 
his volleyball knowledge. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
Normand is also a great motivator, according to his players. Senior middle 
blocker Chris Young says his intensity and competitiveness have played key 
roles in the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically he gives us confidence," Young said. "He teaches us great techniques 
and to believe in ourselves. He makes us believe that no one in our league is 
unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
Young says there's a big difference between former men's Coach Rich Rosales and 
Normand. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is a lot more disciplined," Young said. "He sets his rules and you have 
to follow them. It's all more structured now. We have a very rigorous 
weightlifting and conditioning program. As a result, I feel much stronger this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Normand also brought immediate success to the Loyola women's team. He led the 
Lions to a 7-7 mark during his first season in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He won't coach the women next year, in order to dedicate more time to the men 
and pursue an administrative position in Loyola's athletic department. Junior 
setter Anita Irwin says he will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said Normand did wonders for the women's team, which posted a dismal 2-12 
record in 1988 under former Coach George Yamashita. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it took some adjusting," she said, "because he's a very demanding 
coach, both physically and mentally. But that helped almost every aspect of my 
game, from jumping to my stamina. He's a great coach and he knows the game so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Normand says that's the result of more than two decades of training with the 
game's finest. 
</P>
<P>
His first two volleyball coaches, he says, had the most impact on him. The 
first, Harlan Cohen, taught him skills, and the second, UCLA Coach Al Scates, 
taught him mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, an assistant under Scates at UCLA, introduced Normand to the game in 
1967. Normand was a hotshot football, baseball and basketball player at Black 
Fox Academy, an all-boys school in Los Angeles. Cohen figured the enthusiastic 
young athlete would succeed in volleyball as well. 
</P>
<P>
And Normand did. He was an immediate hit. He played for a Santa Monica club 
under Cohen for two years before serving in the Army from 1969 to 1970. Then he 
competed at UCLA, where he was an all-American in 1973 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"Stormin' Normand" led the Bruins to the 1974 national championship against 
favored UC Santa Barbara in front of a rowdy Santa Barbara crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike was our spiritual leader on the floor," Scates said. "He was our best 
hitter, and he played a very emotional game. He's the reason we won that match. 
His hitting was fantastic, and he had a tremendous vertical jump. He was very 
strong and very quick." 
</P>
<P>
Scates, who has led UCLA to 15 national titles in 27 years, says Normand got 
his nickname because of his intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"During that NCAA game in 1974," Scates said, laughing, "he got a wide set on 
the left side and he put it away with his left hand against a 6-foot-5 star 
blocker from UCSB. Then he ran around the perimeter of the court pointing to 
his left bicep. He told the Santa Barbara crowd, 'Look what I can do to your 
All-American with my left hand!' He always had lots of enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Normand believes that's what made him a good player. He says he never had 
natural talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt I was a great player. I've just played with great players and 
I've had great coaching. I was a mediocre player who trained and worked harder 
than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
After UCLA, Normand played professionally for one year in a now-defunct men's 
pro league. Then he won three open beach titles, one of them with Sinjin Smith, 
arguably the world's best professional beach player and known today as "King of 
the Beach." 
</P>
<P>
"Sinjin won his first open with me in 1977," Normand said. "I remember it was 
the Hermosa Open." 
</P>
<P>
Normand still plays on the beach when he's not coaching or spending time with 
his wife and two children in their Westchester home. Up until last year he 
competed for Molten, an 18-and-over club in Carson that won several national 
titles while Normand was on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real competitor," said Catalino Ignacio, Molten's coach of 11 years. 
"When he plays, he's a real winner. He's very aggressive and he really hates 
losing."

CHUTE TAKES HIS BEST SHOT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER SETTING GLENDALE COLLEGE SINGLE-SEASON HOME RUN RECORD, SLUGGER 
CHASES CAREER MARK.

<P>
No one, not even Art Chute himself, thought he was a power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
When Chute arrived at Glendale College 2 1/2 years ago, the first thing Vaquero 
Coach Steve Coots did was hand him a ball and point toward the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
Chute dutifully focused on keeping the ball in the park rather than hitting it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Only a stroke of luck, in the peculiar form of an arm injury, gave Chute a 
chance to develop the stroke that has made him one of the most prolific home 
run hitters in school history. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 home runs, Chute has eclipsed the single-season record of nine that he 
shared with Todd Gauntlet (1979), Tom Wallace (1983) and Ron Ratliff (1985). 
And, with five games left, he is one home run away from tying the career mark 
of 17 set by Ratliff. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that I expected things to turn out like this," said Chute, who 
plays first base. "I was a pretty good hitter and pitcher in high school, but 
nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
Chute (6-foot, 200 pounds) came to Glendale after graduating from Temple City 
High. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious he had some potential," Coots recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, though, Coots thought that potential might flourish on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Chute, a left-hander, had been a second-team All-Rio Hondo League selection in 
high school, compiling a 6-5 record his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
He worked out as a pitcher for the Vaqueros during the fall of 1987, but 
injured the ulnar nerve in his left elbow and was forced to sit out the season 
as a redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it was the best thing that could have happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
Chute was born in November and was always young for his class. The year away 
from competition narrowed the gap, physically, between him and his peers. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I was always playing with guys that were older and I did 
average," Chute said. "Then I'd go play summer ball with guys my age and do 
really well. 
</P>
<P>
"So sitting out that year was good because it allowed me to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Coots installed Chute at first base. He batted .326 with six home 
runs and 33 runs batted in and was named to the All-Western State Conference 
first team by league coaches. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has continued his assault on WSC pitchers. Along with his 10 
homers, Chute is batting .409 and has driven in 41 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got his sophomore confidence," College of the Canyons Coach Len Mohney 
said. "A lot of guys have good first years and then country-club it through 
their second year. That doesn't seem to be the case with him." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, last summer Chute lifted weights religiously and added 15 pounds of 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
He has combined his new-found strength with more discipline at the plate and 
the result is a record-breaking season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot more patient this season," Chute said. "I don't think about hitting 
home runs. I just get up there to swing and they go out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Chute's power and consistency this season drew interest from several four-year 
schools. He recently made an oral commitment to attend Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"(Fullerton Coach Larry) Cochell said he needed a first baseman," Chute said. 
"I also was considering UC Riverside but I chose Fullerton because it's an 
established Division I program that is competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, too, has been competitive this season -- but not as consistently as 
Chute had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros entered this week's play 11-19 overall and 6-9 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have one of the best teams in the league," Chute said. "We're just 
not playing like it. 
</P>
<P>
"We get up for the games when we know we're playing teams like Canyons or 
Moorpark. Our level of intensity fluctuates so much, you never know what we're 
going to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros are shooting for a strong finish, hoping to qualify for the 
four-team Shaugnessy playoff tournament that will determine the WSC's second 
representative in the Southern California regional of the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be great if we came together at the end and got hot," Chute said. 
"That would be the perfect time."

DON'T ADVERTISE THEIR DISABILITIES, AND THE PUPPETEERS HAVE DAZZLED CRITICS

Ever since she started her black-light puppet theater 16 years ago, Diane Dupuy 
has been working to include the developmentally disabled in her troupe. But she 
always has looked at the company, the Famous People Players, as a professional 
one, never as a therapy group. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too young to even think about therapy," says Dupuy, now 41. "I thought 
of it as a professional company, and it became a professional company." 
</P>
<P>
The Famous People Players made it on Dupuy's terms: They worked as an opening 
act for Liberace in Las Vegas on and off for 10 years. They pulled off a 
successful five-week stint of their own on Broadway, and they continue to tour 
eight months out of the year. They bring their show "Colors in the Dark" to the 
Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton on Friday and to Orange Coast College in Costa 
Mesa on Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 puppeteers -- all but three of whom are disabled -- are never seen 
during the production. Dressed all in black and working against a black 
background, they manipulate life-size fluorescently painted puppets that glow 
under ultraviolet lights. The "famous people" portrayed tend toward the glitzy: 
Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Liza Minnelli and others, including Liberace 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Dupuy, reached by phone at her Toronto home, said she feels some kinship with 
the developmentally disabled in that she was a slow learner. She "really 
disliked school immensely" and dropped out before high school, she said. She 
began doing puppet shows and in 1971 was asked to perform for a group of 
retarded youngsters. Though reluctant at first, she took the gig and was 
inspired by the experience to work with retarded young adults. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, she received a three-month, $15,000 Canadian government grant to start 
up the Famous People Players. The group spent a year perfecting its first 
routine, a five-minute Liberace bit. Dupuy hounded Liberace's management to get 
an audience with the entertainer and finally landed one in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace was not told right away that the performers were disabled. "We wanted 
to be judged on the merits of our performance," Dupuy said. "We didn't want 
anything out of sympathy." Liberace liked the troupe so much that he signed it 
on as an opening act. 
</P>
<P>
Dupuy says she didn't advertise the "inspirational" side, as she puts it, of 
the Famous People Players' story, but slowly the word got out. The troupe 
became the subject of newspaper and magazine features, an Emmy-winning 
documentary and a 1984 TV movie called "Special People." 
</P>
<P>
All the attention was terrific, Dupuy said, but much of it was patronizing, 
praising the show as "wonderful work by handicapped people." Dupuy, intense and 
driven as always, decided that she had something further to prove and set the 
company a new goal -- Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
She had little idea how to get there. At one point, to raise money, she ordered 
1 million Famous People Players buttons for the troupe to sell. "You have no 
idea what a million buttons coming off a truck looks like," she says now, 
laughing. "I had nightmares of buttons chasing me down the street." 
</P>
<P>
But with help from actor Paul Newman, the players lined up five weeks at the 
Lyceum Theatre in 1986. They drew strong reviews from the notoriously tough New 
York critics. "No praise is too high for the visual art effects, the lighting 
and the dazzling expertise of the unseen performers," wrote Clive Barnes in the 
New York Post. Richard F. Shepard of the New York Times called it an 
"iridescent spectacle that drenches the senses in sight and sound." 
</P>
<P>
"If we could win rave reviews from critics, then no one could call us 
'retarded' anymore," Dupuy said. "It just goes to show you that you can 
accomplish anything. The word 'impossible' just means it's going to take a 
little longer." 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is working to establish a permanent home in Toronto with a 500-seat 
theater, restaurants and a toy-repair shop. Currently, "our home base is a bus 
traveling Route 66," said Dupuy, who hopes to have the new facility open in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Famous People Players perform Friday at 8 p.m. at the Plummer Auditorium, 
201 E. Chapman Ave. in Fullerton (admission: $10 to $15; information: (714) 
773-3371) and Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in the Robert B. Moore Theatre at Orange 
Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road in Costa Mesa (tickets: $5.50 to $11; 
information: (714) 432-5880). A performance at OCC Monday morning for children 
is sold out.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until December, the events of last year were part of a steadily swelling wave 
of adulation for Father Bruce Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
The Franciscan priest who founded Covenant House in an East Village tenement in 
1969 and turned it into the nation's largest shelter program for street 
children was honored at the White House by President George Bush. Former 
President Ronald Reagan came by for lunch. Boys Town gave him its Father 
Flanagan Award for Service to Youth. 
</P>
<P>
But the wave hit the rocks in December with the start of a lengthy stream of 
allegations and events that have severed Ritter's relationship with the 
$87-million-a-year program and sent him into seclusion. Many of his friends and 
associates have gone into seclusion themselves. Those who will speak to the 
press seem haunted. Most describe a process of soul-seaching, looking for 
something to shed light on how Ritter could have come upon such days. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot for them to sort out: allegations of sexual misconduct with 
clients and cover-ups; a secret "Franciscan Charitable Trust Fund" known to 
only one Franciscan, Ritter; unorthodox loans to Covenant House board members 
and staff and Ritter's sister; questionable living arrangements between some 
senior staff and clients. There have been investigations by the Manhattan 
district attorney's office (dropped), the Franciscan order (completed) and the 
state attorney general (ongoing). 
</P>
<P>
In early February, Ritter was ordered by the Franciscans to take a leave for 
rest and recuperation. By the end of that month, at their urging, he resigned 
as president of Covenant House. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, declared the 
situation "a mess," and appointed two diocesan priests to temporarily take over 
administration of the non-sectarian organization. "It is no longer a question 
of guilt or innocence, but of public perception," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations created an atmosphere so bizarre and scandalous that by late 
March it seemed sadly ironic but not shocking to see Ritter ridiculed in 
absentia on New York's "sex channel" (Manhattan Cable). 
</P>
<P>
During "Midnight Blue," a show sponsored by Screw magazine publisher Al 
Goldstein, Ritter -- the crusader against pornography, the sex industry and all 
who prey upon the young -- was "inducted" into a "Hall of Hypocrisy" amid much 
off-camera jeering. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gone from being Saint Bruce to Bad Bruce," said Covenant House board 
member Ellen Levine, who is editor-in-chief of Woman's Day magazine. "I think 
of him essentially as a very complicated person with what continues to look to 
me like pretty good intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Former board member Donna Santasiero, executive director of the Brooklyn Bureau 
of Community Service, described Ritter's powerful effect on people during 
public appearances. In the next breath, she called the priest "standoffish," 
adding, "I think he's shy, for one thing." 
</P>
<P>
He hated formal occasions, Santasiero said, including fund-raising dinners for 
Covenant House. 
</P>
<P>
"Such things are wearing for most of us. There's a lot of show, you have to 
project. But for him a cocktail party was so remarkably painful. He'd see me 
and say, 'Oh, Donna, I just can't stand this,' and he meant it. . . . I think 
he enjoyed more of a solitary life." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Lasdon, a former member of Covenant House's legal department and a lawyer 
now working for a homeless advocacy program, continues to respect Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
If there is truth to any of the allegations, Lasdon said, it stems from the 
rapid, unstructured growth of the program. "The program got so big that not 
changing his mom-and-pop, folksy way of doing work caught up with him." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Rocky, a former director of public affairs for Covenant House, said she 
feels betrayed by Ritter and the inner circle of highly paid staff who 
surrounded him. Nonetheless, she expressed some feelings similar to Lasdon's. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear Bruce was a reluctant hero," Rocky said. "He was reticent, 
introspective at best. He started out quietly, slowly, at the grass-roots 
level. . . . I don't think he evolved with the job." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter's friends and associates are consistent in describing a man whose modus 
operandi derived more from Catholic tradition and culture -- performing works 
of mercy -- than the bureaucratic world of social work. 
</P>
<P>
They all describe an independent man, who, despite a lifetime of commitment and 
connections to institutions, operated around them -- ignoring or bending rules, 
sometimes with contempt, often articulating his conviction that he was doing 
the Lord's work. In his case, the Lord's work was for "my kids." 
</P>
<P>
He was born John Ritter in Trenton, N.J., on Feb. 25, 1927, taking the name of 
Bruce when he entered religious life. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a poor family, he went to public schools, joined the Navy during 
the war and in 1947 entered the Order of Friars Minor Conventual. 
</P>
<P>
With the Franciscans he prepared for a life of teaching medieval theology, a 
fact he has jokingly said left him ill-prepared for bureaucracy, politics or 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
He was ordained in Rome in 1956. In biographical data supplied by Covenant 
House in recent years and publications such as "Who's Who," as well as in 
casual statements by Ritter, it has been said he was awarded his doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
But he never received it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was after him constantly to get it," said Brother Luke Salm, a Christian 
Brother at Manhattan College in the Bronx, where Ritter taught from 1963 to 
1968. Chairman of the theology department when Ritter taught there, Salm said 
he was an excellent teacher who had done all the work for his degree except the 
final requirement: publication. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter held off, Salm said, wanting to perfect it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say to him, 'For God's sake, nobody's going to read the damn thing. Just 
get it,' " Salm said. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter has often described his years at Manhattan College as happy and 
comfortable ones, and that is how others describe his years, too. 
</P>
<P>
He lived in a cottage on campus, taught, worked in campus ministry and headed 
the Christian Life Council, a social action organization. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mid '60s students were rebeling and it was pretty evident Bruce was 
riding with the students," Salm said. "He was interested in them and their 
concerns. Some night he'd have three or four of them sleeping on the floor. 
Their parents had thrown them out because they had long hair or were missing 
Mass." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the students who made their way to Ritter's cottage were distressed. 
Hugh O'Neill, now with the Port Authority but then a student on the track team, 
called the place "an unofficial hangout for the track team." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Fahey, now a professor in the religious studies department at Manhattan, 
was then a young instructor who regarded Ritter as a mentor. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, I heard wonderful things from the kids. He was popular, 
dedicated, almost a mystic. You'd hear that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter was something of a hero, Fahey said. For example, the priest put his 
foot down on an ROTC custom, refusing to allow the reserve officers, during 
special Masses offered for them, to stand and raise fixed bayonets during the 
consecration. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Salm said, "he had an independent streak in him. There's no 
question it led to a lot of this difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter has always said that a public challenge from Hugh O'Neill during an 
on-campus Mass prompted him to leave academia. Ritter said he had taunted the 
students that in a short time they would "sell out," giving up their youthful 
ideals for material success and the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't you practice what you preach? O'Neill is said to have asked him. 
</P>
<P>
Although O'Neill remembers it less dramatically -- a small Mass in a student 
lounge rather than a full congregation in church, a dialogue more than a 
declamation -- O'Neill confirms the incident. He had no idea until years later 
that Ritter regarded it as seminal. 
</P>
<P>
With the permission of his Franciscan superiors, Ritter left Manhattan College 
for the East Village in May, 1968, with no plans but a determination to make 
himself useful to the poor. By the following February, he has written, after 
six children asked him for shelter during a snow storm, Covenant House was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days it was, in O'Neill's words, an informal "crash pad for 
runaways." O'Neill, and others from Manhattan and other Catholic colleges 
helped out, some moving in for a time, as O'Neill did in 1973. They got by on 
small donations, many of them obtained through Ritter's guest preaching at 
various parishes on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true Ritter was burglarized by junkies repeatedly, he gave as good 
as he got, taking the law into his own hands. He hired neighborhood toughs to 
burglarize and trash the junkies' pads, which he later took over. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holy Spirit made me do it," he has written, justifying it as "muscular 
Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
In those early informal years, confronted with increasing numbers of kids with 
nowhere to go, Ritter became committed to a policy of "open intake," never 
turning a child away. As O'Neill recalled, it was a matter of finding room for 
one more -- on a couch or the floor -- in quarters where staff, volunteers and 
children were living together. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, When Ritter decided it was time to go legitimate, get licensed as a 
child-care agency and raise money, he was told by authorities that he "was 
guilty of harboring and contributing to the delinquency of a minor." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter later described that as bureaucratic absurdity, but his casual "there's 
always room for one more" approach contributed to his troubles of recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
At least two staff members recently resigned from the agency after it was 
learned they had Covenant House clients living with them, and Ritter himself 
admitted he stayed in a motel with a youth he was counseling. The youth alleged 
they had an on-going sexual relationship, which Ritter has steadily denied. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Bruce Ritter explained Covenant House to me," Ellen Levine said, "was 
that it has less to do with social work and more to do with social obligation. 
He said to me, 'What kind of a society lets kids sleep in the street?' " 
</P>
<P>
It was in the late 1970s that Covenant House took a major leap. Ritter's work 
caught the attention of Robert Macauley, a prominent Catholic businessman, 
philanthropist and lifelong friend of President Bush. Macauley, who has refered 
to Ritter as his best friend, brought several other wealthy, conservative 
Catholics on the board, including industrialist J. Peter Grace and William 
Simon Jr., secretary of the treasury during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
To Donna Santasiero, these are the men "who made Bruce go big time." 
</P>
<P>
Macauley has agreed. It was he who persuaded a reluctant Ritter to raise money 
by writing monthly anecdotal letters about his "kids." It was enormously 
effective. Direct mail contributions account for about 95% of the Covenant 
House budget. 
</P>
<P>
The funds led to property acquisitions, expanded programs, international 
houses, and an operation that took on corporate trappings. 
</P>
<P>
To some, Covenant House was growing too fast, and at the expense of good 
program. They describe an atmosphere of secrecy among an inner circle of senior 
staff while others were left in the dark and underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
One former staff member, requesting anonymity, watched as Ritter, following an 
exhausting schedule of appointments, began sizing up potential meetings with 
people, rejecting some because their potential for contributions or contacts 
did not measure up. 
</P>
<P>
These former associates do not accuse Ritter of self-enrichment; rather they 
call him a Spartan type who was not much for creature comforts. Ellen Levine 
remembers her frustration over Ritter's refusal of a car and driver to bring 
him to a dinner party at her house in New Jersey several years ago. He was 
extremely weak from his bout with Hodgkin's disease and chemotherapy, but even 
when she negotiated downwards to a taxi, she said he refused, calling it 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
As Joseph Fahey sees it, "He was in over his head." 
</P>
<P>
One steadfast critic of Ritter on program and policy is William Traenor at the 
American Youth Work Center, a youth advocacy agency, in Washington. Part of the 
problem that developed with Covenant House, Traenor believes, is that Ritter 
was perceived by the public as running a Catholic agency, while in reality it 
was a secular, nonprofit organization. The largely Catholic board deferred to 
the priest. 
</P>
<P>
"For some purposes Covenant House could be seen as secular, at other times, 
Catholic," Traenor said. "And in between, there sat Ritter, with the Church 
thinking the secular board was keeping an eye on him, (and vice versa.) He 
became totally unaccountable . . . and all that money did what all that money 
usually did. It was all loose change." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Hugh O'Neill said, he has found himself looking back to those early 
days with Ritter "trying to put all that stuff going on now in some context." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations of sexual misconduct do not gibe with his image of Ritter, 
O'Neill said, and, as a friend he accepts his denial. 
</P>
<P>
Inadvertent financial improprieties are easier for O'Neill to envision. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing Bruce, he would not have paid close attention to what you can and 
cannot do regarding the laws of IRS, of New York state. Beyond that, is it 
possible that at several key turns Bruce forgot the distinction between himself 
and the organization he created, when, as it got larger, there needed to be 
more of a distinction? Yeah."

In February, Macauley, chairman of the board from 1977 until last fall, spoke 
of his fears for the future of the organization: "Father Bruce is Covenant 
House," Macauley said. "Without him, Covenant House will fail -- or be vastly 
reduced. No question about it." 
</P>
<P>
But the agency is battling that prediction and image. The directors have 
ordered a private, outside investigation of every allegation "no matter how 
wild," and an independent program evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Operating under siege for months, Covenant House is sending out press releases 
about continued service and new board members, assuring reporters that 
donations are running ahead of projections. 
</P>
<P>
Part of moving ahead is a determination to dissociate Covenant House from Bruce 
Ritter. As one Covenant House spokesman said, in response to a query, "Father 
Ritter is no longer associated with us."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 23, 1945, Ginetta Sagan was rescued from a Nazi torture chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Two Germans impersonating Gestapo agents dragged her off the floor of the 
interrogation room and threw her into a car. In sinister silence, they drove 
the 20-year-old Italian Resistance fighter not to the execution she was 
expecting, but to a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
They handed her over to the Mother Superior without a word and drove off. Sagan 
never saw them again. Nearly two months of starvation, rape and torture had 
left her skeletal. But she was alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan celebrates the 45th anniversary of her personal liberation this month. 
But unlike some victims who wanted only to forget, Sagan has devoted much of 
her life to seeing that other prisoners are not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
She has lobbied for the release of prisoners of conscience in Greece, Chile, 
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Vietnam -- both before and after the Communist 
victory. She helped launch Amnesty International on the West Coast, funneled 
money to Lech Walesa and started a human rights group of her own, the Aurora 
Foundation in Atherton. And for more than a decade, she has been involved in 
controversial work involving alleged human rights abuses in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she has probably organized more people than anyone else in the human 
rights movement globally," said David Hinkley, a former West Coast director of 
Amnesty International. "She really is the one who got Amnesty International off 
the ground in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, she's an embodiment of the human rights movement," Hinkley added. 
"The human rights movement as we know it today was born out of the Holocaust 
and World War II. It was a product of people saying, 'This is never going to 
happen again if I have anything to do about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Sagan said she spent two years in and out of hospitals, healing 
physically and slowly conquering a deep depression. She attended the Sorbonne, 
then went to the University of Chicago to study medicine but instead met and 
married Leonard Sagan, a physician and public health expert. They have three 
children and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan, now 65, is small, plump (a reaction, she says, to having been starved), 
and favors high-necked clothing that covers her scars. She is reportedly a 
fabulous cook, who held back-yard barbecues and once taught cooking to suburban 
homemakers to raise money for Amnesty. And she has a sun room filled with 
dozens of flowering orchids. 
</P>
<P>
She loves to tell stories, in a rollicking Italian accent, about the brave 
exploits of her comrades in the Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The doors and windows to Sagan's home were flung open to the sun on a recent 
afternoon. Books and papers in French, English and Italian carpeted four 
different desks and filled several large bureaus. Underneath a dining room 
table, also eclipsed by papers and boxes of fund-raising letters, a neighbor's 
cat was snoozing on an Oriental rug. 
</P>
<P>
Life as a human rights activist has not always been so serene. Indeed, although 
Sagan insists her mission is not political, she has by turns been glorified and 
ostracized by both the American right and left. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, while on a national tour to publicize abuses in the 
Vietnamese prisons of the American-backed Thieu regime, she remembers she was 
called a traitor and "Commie sympathizer," was pelted with tomatoes and 
received "unpleasant" phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Sagan learned that some of the Vietnamese who had provided her with 
information about abuses by the Thieu regime had been tortured and died in 
Communist jails. But when she began to document mistreatment of Vietnamese 
"re-education camp" prisoners, former allies in the anti-war movement turned 
against her. There were death threats and letters suggesting she was a CIA 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I was called time after time a 'fascist,' and a 'cold warrior,' for doing this 
study of the re-education camps, by some of the same people with whom I worked 
on human rights issues in Chile, in Brazil, in South Africa," Sagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Some liberals believed Sagan had been duped into giving credence to the 
prediction by the right that a Communist takeover would lead to a blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, her admirers included conservative Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita), and the Readers' Digest Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation, 
among others, have supported her work on Vietnam. So, she says, have European 
friends, most of whom are socialists. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan continues to earn praise from unlikely opposites. Singer Joan Baez is a 
longtime friend and ally. Former President Ronald Reagan singled her out for 
praise on Human Rights Day, Dec. 10, 1986, and the next year she was awarded 
the Jefferson Award for public service. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan says some former critics have come around to her point of view; other 
friends still have not forgiven her. She remains relentlessly cheerful -- a 
childhood trait. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been a torture victim and she's been in contact with people who have 
been through the tortures of the damned all her life," Hinkley said. "But she 
knows that you have to keep living." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's views are not altered by the varied reaction to her work. She insists 
that the ideology of a torturer matters little to his victim. 
</P>
<P>
"I am too busy to bother with people who have preferential countries," she 
said. "I think they have every right to their beliefs, and I will go to any 
lengths to defend them. 
</P>
<P>
"However, my only duty is one, careful documentation, and two, I have my duty 
to the victims. Many of those people have commitments to governments . . . 
governments of the left, governments of the right. They have a list of 
rationalizations, reasons for why you should only work for prisoners in this 
country or that. 
</P>
<P>
"We must remember them all," she added. "We cannot be selective in our 
outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan was raised in Milan, the daughter of two doctors who worked quietly in 
the anti-fascist movement. Her mother was a Polish-born Jew; long before the 
war began, her father, an Italian Catholic, arranged fake papers to give his 
daughter a safe, Christian identity. It would later save her life. 
</P>
<P>
Politics invaded her earliest memories. She recalls her parents warning friends 
to leave Germany, and her father telling her, when the news came that Adolf 
Hitler had invaded Austria, "That man is going to destroy all of Europe, and 
then he will destroy himself." 
</P>
<P>
By age 16, she was working as a courier for the Resistance, carrying messages 
and ferrying paper to feed clandestine presses. They called her "Topolino," or 
"little mouse." Gradually, she took more risks, such as disguising herself as a 
cleaning girl to get into government offices to pilfer stationery for use to 
forge papers or to make wax imprints of seals. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents had arranged with a servant to put a warning sign in the window if 
police ever came to search the home. She came home one day and spotted the sign 
in the window. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I saw this black car in front of the house, and I knew," she said. "So I 
just had to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
At first, she slept in a bombed-out building. Then the underground took her in. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she learned her father had been driven out to a field, told to walk away 
from the car and shot in the back. He was listed as an "attempted escape." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm so familiar with the so-called 'attempted escape' 
assassinations that dictators carry out in so many countries," Sagan said, 
adding that any reports of political prisoners' deaths from escapes or suicides 
should be immediately investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother was reportedly sent to Auschwitz, where she is believed to have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize that these are very ordinary stories," Sagan said. Her 
stories are punctuated by telephone calls, questions from a young volunteer, 
and the arrival of a Catholic nun who is helping Sagan sort through her papers 
(Stanford University has asked her to donate documents about the early years of 
Amnesty). 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's own horror story began after two Resistance friends were captured. She 
was sent from Milan into the mountains to learn whether the partisans had 
captured any Germans who might be traded in a hostage swap. Along the way, she 
heard rumors that the police were looking for someone fitting her description 
-- rumors she thinks began with a Florentine informer. 
</P>
<P>
She had planned to walk back, but her feet were so swollen that she took the 
bus. She fell asleep. When she awoke, the bus was in a square full of officers 
of the Black Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
She was interrogated mainly by Italians but also a few times by Germans. She 
said she later learned her captors had recruited criminals to work in the 
torture chambers. "What they did was to destroy the dossier of prisoners who 
were socio-sexual psychopaths, in exchange for them doing their dirty work. 
This had never happened in Italy before." 
</P>
<P>
She prefers not to discuss the details. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awful, but I wanted to survive. That was for me a driving, driving 
force. . . . I didn't want to disappear like a grain of dust or sand. . . . I 
wanted to tell the story if I possibly could." 
</P>
<P>
What anger remains she seems to have reserved for informants. "I have utter 
contempt for people who betray people. . . . The informer is the first step 
leading to the physical and sometimes emotional destruction of decent human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sagan has focused on the humane treatment of prisoners, she also 
stresses economic justice and is fond of remarking, "Human rights begin at 
breakfast." She also remains committed to nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not hesitate to work for victims whether they are peaceful or have used 
violence," she said. "But personally I feel . . . violence is not as effective 
as people think, and . . . violence creates other victims, often creating a 
circle of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"These people who claim that this is naive confuse nonviolence with passivity," 
she added. "There are so many methods, strategies, to achieve the goal of 
liberation without violence." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan takes particular joy in the peaceful democratization of Eastern Europe, 
which has also boosted the fortunes of some of the former "jail birds" she 
helped. She counts among her close friends, for example, the dissident Czech 
journalist Karel Kyncl, who signed the Charter 77 Human Rights Manifesto and 
was exiled to London in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, "he and his wife went back to Prague for the first time -- 
aboard the presidential plane" of another former jailbird, Vaclav Havel, a 
playwright who is now the Czech leader, Sagan said. "I was so delighted!" 
</P>
<P>
The Sagans headed back to Poland this month at the invitation of Barbara 
Piasecka Johnson, the Polish-born Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical heiress. 
Sagan said Johnson, who has quietly donated more than $100,000 to the Aurora 
Foundation to support Sagan's work for Solidarity and on behalf of human 
rights, had promised to exhibit her private collection of religious art in 
Poland if her homeland were free. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled that she was walking around the exhibit, on display at the Royal 
Castle in Warsaw, when she said out loud, " 'Do you realize we don't have to 
worry about anybody following us around?' And everybody cracked up." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's memories of Poland haven't always been so fond. Two years ago, she was 
driving to Auschwitz with a Polish dissident when the steering mechanism 
mysteriously failed and the car spun out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting crash cost her the use of a shoulder, a disability that has 
limited her cooking, traveling, typing and even looking after her orchids. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she tells the story with a certain Italian-accented glee. It 
seems the dissident, Zbigniew Romaszewski, a physicist and Solidarity leader 
once tried for plotting to overthrow the Polish government, has now been 
elected senator. He believes the car was tampered with, says Sagan, and he 
plans to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a survivor," she said happily, showing a visitor grisly snapshots taken 
at the accident scene. "I have my life twice! Twice!" 
</P>
<P>
There have been other brushes with intrigue and danger. On the day that leftist 
Chilean President Salvador Allende was assassinated -- but before the news 
media reported his death -- Sagan said she was approached in the Los Angeles 
airport by a Latino man who told her, "We got Allende, and if you don't stop 
that crap in Latin America, we'll get you, too." The next morning, the phone 
rang, and a tape recording in Italian informed her of the death. Later, she 
said, a similar recording advised her to look into what was going on in the 
National Stadium in Santiago, which turned out to have been used as a detention 
and torture center. 
</P>
<P>
Her home was broken into twice in the 1980s; files, calendars, itineraries and 
address books were taken. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is not over. After a decade of work, Sagan has finally 
published her 150-page report on violation of human rights in Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam. The report is based on interviews with more than 800 
former re-education camp prisoners now living in the Philippines, France and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
By systematically cross-checking their stories against survivors of the same 
camps, and against reports from European journalists and intelligence officials 
-- some of them old friends from the Resistance -- Sagan has compiled a 
devastating dossier of abuse, torment and degradation. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope that (former prisoners) place in having the world know what has 
happened and do something about it is unbelievable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of her fiercest critics, John McAuliff, formerly of the American Friends 
Service Committee and now director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation 
Project, said recently that he has not read the report. 
</P>
<P>
But McAuliff said that, over the years, he has doubted the reliability of 
Sagan's information on Vietnam, which he called "simply more extreme than other 
accounts we were hearing, both in terms of numbers (of prisoners) and in terms 
of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Sagan: "I have so many details. But it doesn't matter how many 
details you give these people, they will never believe it. Just like people 
didn't believe the Nazi camps." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sagan, who has sometimes given inspirational speeches at Joan 
Baez concerts, hopes her efforts will inspire a new generation to continue the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people believe the job is done," she said. "It isn't." 
</P>
<P>
In every country, she said, it is the best minds and the most principled people 
who see the faults in repressive governments first, and, therefore, are 
targeted first; they also are precisely the people who can most help their 
countries and must be saved. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan thinks it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in a happy world," she said.

<P>
AUTHOR: THE CANADIAN'S NEW NOVEL, 'SOLOMON GURSKY,' HAS WON CRITICAL ACCLAIM 
AND RACKED UP IMPRESSIVE SALES AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON TEITELBAUM, Sheldon Teitelbaum, a frequent contributor to the Los 
Angeles Times, grew up in Montreal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>

MONTREAL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaning on a cane, Canadian firebrand Mordecai Richler hobbled into the lobby 
of Montreal's posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The 59-year-old writer had taken a spill 
on the ice outside of his country home on Lac Memphremagog, a resort lake 
straddling the U.S. border in Quebec's Eastern Townships. 
</P>
<P>
"These winters are punishing," acknowledged the bruised but otherwise 
unflappable Montreal native, whose first novel in a decade, "Solomon Gursky Was 
Here," was greeted last year by critics in his country as the most significant 
event in recent Canadian publishing. 
</P>
<P>
By late February, the Canadian edition, published by Penguin Books of Canada, 
had sold 38,000 copies of a 40,000 print run. The novel was also offered as a 
Canadian Book of the Month Club selection, requiring the printing of an 
additional 20,000 copies. In a country of 25 million, a quarter of whom speak 
French, this was an impressive showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gursky" also spent a couple of months on the Toronto Globe and Mail 
best-seller list, earning Richler a cover review in the prestigious magazine 
Books in Canada, and frequent citations in the Canadian newsmagazine Macleans, 
in Saturday Night and in other premium Canadian periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
Richler's books have rarely done this well, proportionately, in the United 
States. But they have always been well received critically. 
</P>
<P>
Released this month in the United States by Knopf, "Solomon Gursky" is a 
556-page family saga, replete with the usual Richler satire and savagery, about 
a boozy writer's lifelong obsession with the doings of a larger-than-life 
Jewish-Canadian patriarch and his offspring. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects the protagonist is a Richler stand-in. And the family is a 
fictional model of the formerly bootlegging, now-legitimate Bronfman clan of 
Montreal, whose doings Canadians regard with almost the same fascination 
Americans have for Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Descendants of a prosperous Russian-Jewish immigrant, the Bronfman family owns 
and controls an enormous and diversified financial empire. In the United 
States, they are best known as the owners of Joseph E. Seagram and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bronfmans were certainly the trigger," Richler acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gurksy" ranges from Victorian London to the Canadian Arctic, from the 
Depression years on the Canadian Prairie to present-day New York. For Richler, 
who has been particular about setting his best books in the Quebec of his youth 
and, occasionally, in London, this has been a change. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the plot's many little tricks, Richler depicts the fictionalized 
patriarch, Ephraim Gursky, as an escaped British convict who survives one of 
history's most inane attempts to locate the elusive Northwest Passage. Gursky 
subsequently converts the native Inuit to his own lusty brand of Orthodox 
Judaism. The more literal-minded of his adherents, however, are almost driven 
to extinction while trying to comply with the Jewish prohibition against eating 
or drinking until the sun goes down on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. In the 
Arctic, it takes the sun takes half a year to set. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gursky Was Here" has had the added effect of thrusting the acerbic 
Richler himself back into the literary limelight just as critics had begun to 
suspect -- or in some cases hope -- that he might have mellowed. 
</P>
<P>
Bronwyn Drainie, a columnist for the Toronto Globe and Mail, recently noted 
that for Canada's normally genteel literary community, this truly was "the 
winter of public discontent." Few could recall the eruption of so many flaps, 
spats and hissing matches. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do so many of these controversies seem to center on Richler, especially 
when he doesn't go looking for them?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
On his permafrost-ridden home turf, the prickly Richler is a caustic social 
critic who makes Southern California's curmudgeon, Harlan Ellison, seem like 
Mr. Rogers. If Richler inspires equal degrees of loathing in some circles, 
suggests Canadian chronicler John Robert Colombo, perhaps the country's ranking 
anthologist, it may be because he is too worldly, too openly Jewish, too urban 
and too outspoken to suit some super-patriots in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Although very much engaged in Canadian life and politics," observed Colombo, 
"Richler has always been a thorn in the sides of nationalists in both English 
and French Canada. He is particularly adept at showing the world how absurdly 
both camps can behave." 
</P>
<P>
Richler is, in fact, more outspokenly Canadian in outlook today than ever. But 
he maintains a distinctly Jewish ambivalence toward excessive patriotism -- 
even toward Israeli nationalism -- which he regards as narrow, insular and 
never terribly healthy for minorities. In a country such as Canada, which took 
98 years to settle on a flag of its own, overt displays of nationalism are, 
Richler has observed, even slightly ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
If he wished to, Richler could spare himself the grueling Quebec winters by 
joining the million or so other snowbirds and Canadian expatriates in the 
Southern California sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
During a 20-year self-imposed exile in London (with sojourns in France, Spain 
and Hollywood and frequent visits home), Richler had achieved a certain degree 
of success as a screenwriter and novelist. His screenplay for "Life at the 
Top," which starred Jean Simmons and the late Lawrence Harvey, was well 
received. He also worked on "Room at the Top." The script he adapted from his 
seminal novel, "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz" a few years after 
returning to Montreal in 1972, was nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Richler learned about the Oscar nomination while visiting Yellowknife, in the 
Northwest Territories. In Yellowknife, the temperature outdoors was 42 below 
zero. But the reception awaiting him at his first Hollywood party was, he would 
discover, no less chilly. 
</P>
<P>
"To mention the Arctic, where I had just come from," he recounted in "Home 
Sweet Home," a collection of essays published five years ago by Knopf, "was to 
watch eyes glaze over in boredom, until I finally learned to say not that I had 
just come down from Yellowknife, but that I had returned from location in 
Yellowknife." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh really? What are they shooting there?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Caribou.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite his cheek, Richler was later called back to work on the film "Fun With 
Dick and Jane," a prospect he greeted with ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a day like this, lots of snow, and I said, 'OK, I'll come down. But I 
don't want to meet with any producers, I won't take meetings, and I want a 
first-class ticket for my wife.' They didn't balk at any of my requests, but 
they thought the last one was the funniest thing they ever heard -- this 
strange Canadian backwoodsman actually wanted his wife to come with him." 
</P>
<P>
Richler returned permanently to his homeland in 1972 because he feared his 
literary vision could not survive the separation from his Canadian roots any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't write novels set in England because I wasn't brought up there," 
said Richler. "I, like (Trinidad-born novelist V. S.) Naipaul, don't know what 
an Englishman does when he goes home at night. I saw writers I knew and 
respected, like Doris Lessing and Dan Jacobson, setting novels in biblical and 
far-future times. I figured I'd better go home before that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
England's and Hollywood's loss has become Canada's gain. John Fraser, the 
editor of Saturday Night, Canada's preeminent magazine of politics, art and 
culture and a frequent publisher of Richler's journalism, has characterized 
"Solomon Gursky" as "vintage, mature Richler." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Richler's previous novels have been rooted in the people and places of 
the Montreal Jewish ghetto of his youth. Richler was the child of Jewish 
immigrants from Russia who quickly steeled themselves against the frigid north 
winds as well as the equally frosty regard in which they were held by the 
province's French-speaking Catholic majority and its almost equally 
disapproving Anglophone minority. 
</P>
<P>
Richler grew up in the St. Urbain Street Jewish ghetto warmly evoked in his 
novels, an impoverished, insular world that was not, however, without charm. 
Many of the places Richler popularized in his book -- the Bagel Factory, for 
instance, and the late Moe Wilensky's corner sandwich store, where a quarter 
once bought a "special" and a Cherry Coke -- have, because of Richler, become 
Montreal icons. 
</P>
<P>
In books like "The Street," "St. Urbain's Horseman," "Joshua Then And Now" and 
"Duddy Kravitz," Richler has kept the period of his youth -- from the start of 
World War II through the early 1950s -- vibrantly alive. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my time, my place," Richler has said, "and I have elected myself to 
get it right." According to one critic, he has brought "his native city of 
Montreal to life as no writer has been able to do before." 
</P>
<P>
He has done so, however, often to the intense discomfort of his fellow Jews, 
who do not always appreciate being reminded -- or having Richler remind others 
-- of their humble origins. Indeed, Richler's relationship with other Montreal 
Jews has been prickliest of all. Many think Mordecai Richler's books and 
pronouncements inspire anti-Semitism.

Richler's readiness to expound irreverently on matters of grave national 
portent have won him few friends in government, federal or provincial. His 
slightest quips tend to make national headlines. Residents of Edmonton, 
Alberta, may never forgive him for saying theirs was a great town if they ever 
decided to uncrate it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Solomon Gursky," a character describes Canada as "a holding tank filled 
with the disgruntled progeny of defeated peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Passages like this, acknowledges Richler, get cited in the Canadian press and 
have earned him most of his notoriety. But Richler's most deadly venom is saved 
for his native Quebec. He is particularly bitter over what he sees as the 
emasculation by Quebec of the province's English-speaking minority, which 
Richler characterizes -- Jew and Gentile alike -- as "gutless." 
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, they have grown men in the provincial bureaucracy running 
around with tape measures, trying to determine whether the few English-language 
signs permitted in public places use letters that are smaller than those in 
French. 
</P>
<P>
"Future generations," Richler says, "will laugh at our obsessions. We are not 
living through tragedy but farce. If this country flies apart from such 
matters, at least foreigners will find some comic relief in Canada's plight." 
</P>
<P>
Richler believes such comments have earned him the enduring enmity of Quebec 
premier Robert Bourassa, although Bourassa does not speak publicly about 
Richler. Richler has not only held Bourassa up to ridicule within Canada, but 
also has made his government a laughingstock in such prominent American forums 
as the New Yorker, Harper's and the Atlantic Monthly, for which Richler writes 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, these positions have not earned Richler the love of English 
Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys hate Richler," said Colombo, "because he championed the free trade 
deal with the U.S., which most Canadians now regard as a blatant sellout of our 
sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the United States permits, for the first time in Canadian 
history, the relatively free flow of goods and services. Many Canadians believe 
that the protectionism had held Canada, despite its intense regional 
divisiveness, together as a national entity. Without it, Canadians fear the 
commercial and cultural tug of the American behemoth will prove greater than 
the bond among the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Richler has traditionally disparaged Canada's cultural and economic 
protectionism as "tiresome." 
</P>
<P>
"No heritage is worth preserving," he has written, "unless it can survive the 
sun, the mixed marriage, or the foreign periodical." 
</P>
<P>
This position may have been behind Canadian novelist Farley Mowat's savaging of 
Richler in a Toronto weekly this year in a manner some have characterized as 
anti-Semitic. A self-described "chauvinist-nationalist" (who achieved notoriety 
in the United States in 1985 after U.S. customs officials refused him entry 
because of his conservationist activities), Mowat called Richler a 
"non-Canadian" with a Jewish and neighborhood identity but "no sense of 
Canadian identity at all." By attacking Richler's alleged "cosmopolitanism," as 
one critic characterized the quality Mowat objects to, Mowat, wittingly or 
otherwise, used the historical language of anti-Semitism, propagating the 
canard of an innate Jewish incompatibility with patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
But John Fraser, who once spent three weeks in the bush with the author of 
"Never Cry Wolf," does not believe Mowat was intentionally anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Mowat, notes Fraser, "is a merely another small-town Protestant, who probably 
holds the usual small-town Protestant view of Jews." He is also, according to 
Colombo, a pastoralist who celebrates the virtues of the Canadian wilderness 
and has fantasized in his writing about staging a heroic last stand of loyal 
Canadians against encroaching American imperialists at James Bay. Richler, an 
avowed city slicker and alleged Yank-lover, had populated Mowat's beloved 
Arctic with talisman-sporting, Yiddish-singing Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaim given Richler's new book was also apparently too much for the three 
judges of Canada's prestigious Governor-General's Award for Literature. Despite 
its ample critical and commercial success, "Solomon Gursky" not only didn't 
win; it wasn't even nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"That it didn't even make the list," said Fraser, "has more to do with politics 
and the motivations of the judges than it does with Richler or his book. I've 
had a look at the competitors, and to me this was madness." 
</P>
<P>
Richler has declined to comment publicly either about the Mowat flap or the 
snubbing of his book. He is at work on another volume of essays and will soon 
begin a new novel. Mostly, though, he says he is content to sit by his fire on 
the frozen shores of Lac Memphremagog, reading quietly and talking with his 
wife, Florence. Montreal, a city he recognizes as sadly diminished in recent 
years as much of the money and talent fled west and south, is a place he now 
visits for a day each week.
