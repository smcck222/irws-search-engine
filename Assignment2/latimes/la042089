TURKEY FRANKS RECALL; 
</P>
<P>
BACTERIAL INFECTION IS SUSPECTED 
</P>

<P>
A Waco, Tex.,-based food company has voluntarily recalled all brands of its 
turkey hot dogs -- many of which are sold in Southern California -- because of 
suspected bacterial contamination, federal officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The action, involving Plantation Foods Inc., became necessary after laboratory 
tests discovered the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in some of the firm's 
processed meat products. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the recall decision was a Listeriosis illness linked to 
Plantation's hot dogs, federal officials state. A U.S. Department of 
Agriculture representative said the current case marks the first time a 
ready-to-eat meat product was associated with Listeriosis, a potentially fatal 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sells hot dogs under several different brand names including 
Plantation Turkey Franks, NIFDA Turkey Franks, CODE Turkey Franks and Nugget 
Turkey Franks. The products are sold in both one-pound packages in supermarkets 
and in 10-pound packages to institutional food service operations. Distribution 
of the affected items extends along a southern tier of states stretching from 
Georgia to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Uncooked hot dogs, as well as undercooked chicken, have been identified by the 
Centers for Disease Control as high risk foods for potential Listeria 
monocytogenes contamination. The pathogen has also been found in coleslaw, soft 
cheese and other dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reevaluating Its Policy 
</P>
<P>
Based on these findings, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been monitoring 
both beef and poultry hot dogs for the contaminant on a regular basis since 
October, 1988. Under the program, manufacturers were given an opportunity to 
clean up their plants, without a recall, if any of their products were found to 
be contaminated with Listeria. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the recent illness, however, the USDA is reevaluating its 
policy, said Catherine E. Adams, Ph.D., with the Food Safety and Inspection 
Service in USDA. 
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that our policy will be substantially modified," Adams said. "The 
premise had been that Listeria-contaminated processed meat had not caused human 
illnesses, nor even been associated with human illness. But this is a confirmed 
association (between hot dogs and) an illness." 
</P>
<P>
Listeria monocytogenes was identified as the cause of more then 40 deaths, 
mostly stillborns, from improperly manufactured Mexican-style soft cheese in 
the Los Angeles area in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Those with weakened immune systems are considered to be at particular risk from 
Listeria. Included in this group are infants, pregnant women, the elderly and 
the chronically ill such as those suffering from cancer, AIDS and cirrhosis. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the woman who became infected in the recent incident was a 61-year-old 
cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, healthy people are at little risk from Listeria. When an infection 
develops, however, the symptoms typically include fever, chills, headache, 
backache, abdominal pain and diarrhea. CDC estimates that there are about 1,400 
Listeriosis cases annually in this country with a 35% mortality rate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a disease that effects certain groups of people and we are trying to 
determine what recommendations to make to the public and to the food industry," 
said Anne Schuchat MD, medical epidemiologist with the CDC's meningitis and 
pathogens branch. 
</P>
<P>
The important issue in the Plantation Foods case is the presence of a harmful 
bacteria in a ready-to-eat food. Although hot dog packaging recommends that 
people thoroughly heat the frankfurters, some individuals eat them cold or 
undercooked. 
</P>
<P>
"The product -- hot dogs -- should be fully cooked by manufacturers and ready 
to eat as is," said Adams. "That is also something that is being reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
Another area of concern in the current case is that the victim heated the 
turkey hot dog in a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe microwaves do not cook thoroughly enough to kill Listeria. This is an 
area worth looking at and that is in (our) plans," said CDC's Schuchat. 
</P>
<P>
USDA's Adams also said that the effectiveness of microwaves is something that 
federal agencies, in general, need to explore in light of the recent 
Listeriosis case. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think the cold spots in food after microwaving created a significant 
problem or a food safety problem. No agency did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed for Three Days 
</P>
<P>
Once the Listeria discovery was made, Plantation's hot dog production line was 
closed for three days. The firm is now in the process of having the facility 
recertified by USDA as being free from the contaminant, said Lacy Roane Jr., 
chief executive officer. None of the firm's other products are effected by the 
recall, Roane said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any (hot dog) they manufacture does not go out the door until it is analyzed 
as containing no Listeria monocytogenes," said Adams. 
</P>
<P>
USDA officials said that proper cooking of raw meat products as well as 
thorough reheating of processed meats, such as hot dogs, is sufficient 
protection from potentially harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
One meat industry representative said that the current recall and illness are 
isolated incidents and are nothing that should alarm the public. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is concerned about this and will do its best to improve and not 
allow it to happen again," said Stan Wallen, Ph.D., director of science and 
technology for the National Turkey Federation in Reston, Va. "But this is an 
extremely rare event." 
</P>
<P>
Ready-to-eat foods such as hot dogs, Wallen said, are also closely regulated by 
the government and offer more protection than raw items such as meats or 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
"We all assume that companies' pre-cooked foods are absolutely free of 
pathogens. But in reality there are pathogens that find their way into 
processed foods on rare occasions," he said.

DEAR JEANNE: Please see if you can reduce the sodium in the following recipe. I 
know the onion soup mix is loaded with sodium but wonder about the drained 
mushrooms and onions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. A. B., Bettendorf, Iowa 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEEF BOURGUIGNON 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, cut in 1 1/2-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
1 (1 1/2-ounce) package dry onion soup mix 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup dry red wine, about 
</P>
<P>
1 cup canned mushrooms, drained 
</P>
<P>
1 green pepper, cut in 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
1 (15-ounce) can whole onions, drained 
</P>
<P>
Hot cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
Brown steak in skillet. Combine salt, cornstarch, soup mix and 2/3 cup wine in 
2-quart casserole. Stir in steak, mushrooms, green pepper and onions. Bake at 
325 degrees 2 hours or until tender. Add wine during cooking if mixture seems 
too dry. (Reserve liquid from onions and add if needed.) Serve with rice. Makes 
4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. A. B.: By making your own soup mix and using fresh mushrooms and 
onions instead of the canned varieties, you can easily reduce the amount of 
sodium in this recipe. Even drained and rinsed canned vegetables may have 
higher levels of sodium than fresh ones if the label on the can lists sodium as 
an ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
By covering the casserole for the first half of the baking time, you can 
eliminate the problem of the mixture becoming too dry. With just a little more 
effort on your part, I think you will agree that fresh is best when it comes to 
controlling sodium and getting maximum flavor from the calories consumed.

BACK TO BASICS: PIE CRUST SERIES GOES UPPER CRUST, TOPPING ITSELF WITH THE 
FINAL STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This, the final sequence of our pie crust series, addresses adding a top crust. 
Begin by preparing pastry for a double-crust pie and dividing the dough into 
two portions, one slightly larger than the other. 
</P>
<P>
Roll out the larger portion as directed in previous Back to Basics columns and 
fit into the pie plate. Trim the dough, leaving a one-half-inch overhang. Roll 
the smaller portion of dough into a circle about an inch larger in diameter 
than the inverted pie plate. 
</P>
<P>
Vents need to be cut in this top crust to allow steam to escape during baking, 
help keep the crusts crisp and keep the upper crust from rising too high over 
the filling. This may be done using a knife or decorative cutters, with the 
pastry lying flat after rolling. Another easy method is to lightly dust the 
surface of the dough with flour and gently fold it into quarters. Then using a 
sharp knife, cut three or four slits (Step 1) on each of the folded sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leave a One-Inch Overhang 
</P>
<P>
Pour the filling into the bottom crust. Then working quickly, either place the 
folded dough over one corner of the pie with the point of the wedge in the 
center and unfold, or lightly roll it around the rolling pin and unroll over 
the filling (Step 2). Trim, leaving a one-inch overhang. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck the top under the lower crust (Step 4) and press into an upright rim even 
with the edge of the pie plate. A high ridge that rests firmly on the rim 
avoids the edge falling into the pie during baking and acts as a dam, holding 
the filling in the pie. Flute the edge as desired and bake the pie as directed 
in the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to work quickly once the filling is added so that the pie may be 
baked before the bottom crust has a chance to get soggy. Other ways to prevent 
a soggy bottom crust include brushing the bottom crust lightly with egg white, 
melted butter or a light sprinkling of flour before the filling is added. 
Having the filling very hot also helps.

FOOD BRIEFS: CAFFEINE'S BAD RAP WITH HEART PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heart disease patients have little to fear from moderate amounts of caffeine in 
their diets, according to Harvard University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a recent study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, found 
that there was no detectable change in heart rates among those who ingested the 
equivalent of two cups of coffee in a single sitting. 
</P>
<P>
For years this group has been warned to avoid the compound because of potential 
harmful effects. But the results demonstrate, according to the report, that 
caffeine's ability to accelerate heart rhythms to dangerous levels is based 
more on folklore than fact. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas B. Graboys MD and his colleagues in Harvard's School of Public Health 
designed the study to examine the effects moderate amounts of caffeine might 
have on the heart. Those selected for the research project suffered from 
arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers organized 50 subjects into two groups. Each of these were 
served decaffeinated coffee while being monitored by electrocardiographs. 
However, researchers added 200 milligrams of caffeine to the drinks served to 
half of the sample. (A regular cup of coffee contains approximately 100 
milligrams of caffeine.) 
</P>
<P>
The electrocardiograph detected no difference between the two groups' heart 
rates during the comparison, according to Archives of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The study's authors conclude that there is no evidence that modest amounts of 
caffeine disturb heart rhythms "even among patients with known, 
life-threatening arrhythmia," the article states. 
</P>
<P>
A small number of people may be caffeine-sensitive, the researchers concede. 
And these individuals, if also considered arrhythmia patients, may experience 
an aggravation of their condition when exposed to the compound. However, this 
condition can be detected and avoided, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, caffeine is an alkaloid that stimulates the cortex of the 
brain, and in small doses can improve attention, concentration and 
coordination, according to Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking" (Charles 
Scribner's Sons, New York: $29.95). It can also increase the contraction of 
skeletal muscles, making them less susceptible to fatigue. High doses, though, 
can cause a range of problems, the symptoms of which are compounded in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Bedtime Stories -- Folklore was also at the heart of a recent report on the 
myths surrounding home-made sleep aids. 
</P>
<P>
The article, in the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter, was skeptical of those who 
claim that warm milk will hasten sleep, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"No food eaten at bedtime will guarantee a good night's sleep," according to 
the newsletter, which is published by the university's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
High-proteins foods, such as meats and dairy items, may contribute to the sleep 
process, but only indirectly. These products contain large doses of tryptophan, 
an amino acid that helps the brain produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter, that 
brings on feelings of sleepiness and satisfaction. But the amounts of 
tryptophan found in foods is not sufficient enough to effect sleep habits, 
according to the Wellness Letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to treat sleep disorders through diet alone have had inconclusive 
results," the article stated. 
</P>
<P>
Another remedy that wilts under scientific scrutiny is the "nightcap" theory. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but the sleep will probably be fragmented, 
light and unsettled, and you're likely to wake up suddenly," the newsletter 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Those who refrain from eating during the evening hours out of concern for their 
weight accomplish little from this device alone, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no evidence that calories consumed at night are stored more easily as 
fat than those taken in during the day," the Wellness Letter states. 
</P>
<P>
If the food being consumed at night, however, is not part of a typical diet and 
is, instead, high-calorie snack products then there is likely to be weight 
gain. But the food choices would be the source of any waist-line expansion, not 
the time of consumption, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The article also makes several sound suggestions for a good night's sleep. One 
logical step is to avoid caffeine within four hours of bedtime. Smoking at 
night is also ill-advised because the nicotine acts as a stimulant. And any 
strenuous exercises should be completed at least two hours before bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Cleansing -- Washing produce with solutions containing anything 
other than water may be compounding the residue problem on fruit and vegetables 
rather than solving it, according to federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the public's rush to remove farm chemicals, many have begun cleansing 
produce in solutions of soapy water. Others have turned to diluted bleach and 
water rinses. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is now advising consumers to wash fruit and 
vegetables only with fresh water as a means of removing surface chemicals, dirt 
and bacteria. In a recent statement on the issue the agency also warned about 
the use of soap and water on produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Soap residues may be difficult to remove from some foods and soap is not 
intended to be consumed," the advisory stated. 
</P>
<P>
Water is effective on removing surface residues and other debris, according to 
the agency. Brushes can be also used to scour thick-skinned produce. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory did not, however, address the issue of commercial fruit and 
vegetables washes recently being marketed by several companies.

DEAR SOS: Please can you obtain the recipe for grilled turkey served at Border 
Grill? It is a wonderful dish and I am an avid turkey eater as I am allergic to 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JANET 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JANET: We thoroughly enjoyed this grilled turkey dish. During the barbecue 
season you may want to grill the meat as the restaurant does and make the sauce 
separately, but you may also saute the turkey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BORDER GRILL VINEGARED GRILLED TURKEY BREAST 
</P>
<P>
1/2 turkey breast 
</P>

thin escallops. 
</P>
<P>
Season turkey to taste with salt and pepper. Lightly flour, shaking off excess. 
Grill escallops or saute quickly in about 2 tablespoons butter, but don't 
overcook because escallops dry out very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Heat 1/4 cup butter in skillet. Add onion to pan and saute quickly. Add 
vinegar, chicken stock, cracked pepper and salt to taste. Bring to boil. Reduce 
heat slightly and cook until sauce is reduced by half.

Cut 2 tablespoons cold butter into small bits and whip into sauce until smooth. 
Serve hot turkey slices with vinegared pepper sauce spooned over. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Some time ago there was a recipe for Mississippi Mud Pie. I lost it. 
Would appreciate it if you could find it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NELSON 
</P>
<P>
DEAR NELSON: It took some deep-sea diving in our files, but we managed to save 
it from a muddy bottom fate. Marriott's Grand Hotel in Point Clear, Ala., 
originally shared the recipe with us. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MISSISSIPPI MUD PIE 
</P>
<P>
14 cream-filled chocolate cookies 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup clarified butter 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup used coffee grounds 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
1 cup dessert whipped topping mix, chilled 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons instant decaffeinated coffee powder 
</P>
<P>
1 quart plus 3 cups chocolate ice cream, cooled to 14 to 16 degrees 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup coffee liqueur 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chocolate fudge sauce 
</P>
<P>
Place cookies, clarified butter and used coffee grounds into blender container 
and blend until thoroughly combined. Pour mixture into buttered 9-inch pie 
plate. Spread evenly with spatula. Place piece of plastic wrap over mixture, 
top with second pie pan and press firmly to distribute mixture, making certain 
bottom and sides are evenly covered. Remove second pan and plastic sheet and 
chill shell. 
</P>
<P>
Blend whipped topping mix with coffee powder, stirring until dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
Place chocolate ice cream in thoroughly chilled mixing bowl. Whip at medium 
speed with wire whip until smooth, from 2 to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately add whipped topping mixture and liqueur. Continue whipping on high 
speed until mixture thickens, from 2 to 10 minutes, depending on volume. Mound 
mixture into chilled pie shell. Immediately place in freezer and freeze 6 to 8 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly cover top of pie with chocolate fudge sauce and return to freezer to 
freeze completely. Run thin-bladed knife around edge of crust to loosen from 
pan. Cut and serve frozen. Makes 1 (9-inch) pie. 
</P>
<P>
Note: It is important to chill bowl when whipping ice cream and handling 
preparations as quickly as possible to prevent melting. Prepare day ahead for 
best results. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Some time ago you printed a delicious-sounding peanut butter fudge 
microwave recipe. Since I don't own a microwave oven I would prefer a recipe 
using an ordinary gas stove. Can you help?

<P>
A PERFECT GRAND FINALE AT FESTIVE DINNER PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poached Pears With Fudge Sauce will make a grand finale at a festive dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh pears become a spectacular dessert when poached and topped with fudge 
sauce. The fruit is peeled and simmered in lemon flavored syrup, then cooled to 
room temperature or chilled. The remaining syrup is used to make the fudge 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

GOVERNMENT DOESN'T REQUIRE MANDATORY INSPECTION OF SEAFOOD; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S BUYER BEWARE AS CONSUMPTION OF FISH INCREASES TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
How fresh is the seafood you buy? If you are one of the many Americans who are 
eating more catfish, swordfish, or fillet of sole these days, you may find that 
freshness depends on which supermarket or fish store you patronize. The quality 
can be very inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
Fish consumption is at an all-time high in the United States because dietary 
guidelines and health agencies recommend eating more seafood. Americans are 
eating and enjoying dozens of species -- from cod, halibut, salmon and shrimp 
to mussels, skate, tilapia and sea robin. 
</P>
<P>
The nexus between diet and health has changed food preferences, and Americans 
are consuming more low-fat foods than before. 
</P>
<P>
This low-fat category includes both fin fish and shellfish. Per capita 
consumption is 14.7 pounds a year, up more than 11% since 1980. Expectations 
are that annual consumption may approach 30 pounds by 1990. That is still well 
shy of chicken, in the 59.5-pound category, and beef, at a dwindling 79 pounds 
per person. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for seafood keeps climbing because of its high protein content and 
because of the highly polyunsaturated omega-3 oils, found only in seafoods. 
Recent oceanic pollution, however, particularly on the mid-Atlantic Coast, has 
caused concern. More appears to be swimming in the oceans these days than just 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But Is Our Fish Healthy? 
</P>
<P>
As consumers, we are concerned about the fish and seafood we consume from a new 
angle: Are we eating harmful fish and seafood in the quest for a wholesome 
diet? 
</P>
<P>
Are there hidden hazards in our seafood meals? Are fish and shellfish 
contaminated with bacteria and industrial chemicals? How do we know? 
</P>
<P>
There is no mandatory inspection of fish in the United States. Unlike meat and 
poultry, which receive continuous inspection by federal employees, much fish is 
sold virtually unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish is the only commercially produced flesh food not subject to federal 
inspection for wholesomeness," says Ellen Haas, executive director of the 
Washington, D.C.-based Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This can be somewhat alarming when you consider that Americans consume over 
four times as much poultry and five times as much beef as fish, yet seafood 
caused more illnesses in New York State in 1986 than meat and poultry 
combined," Haas said on a visit to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandatory fish inspection is the only way to assure the public of wholesome, 
good-quality, fresh seafood and decrease the health risk," says Haas. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question," she says, "is, 'Why can't it be mandatory in the U.S. as 
it is in Canada?' " 
</P>
<P>
Michael Windham, Louisiana's director of meat and seafood inspection, says the 
"potential danger from human consumption of seafood is greater than it ever has 
been from red meat and poultry." Windham emphasizes his point, noting, "If it's 
important to have as many as 30 meat inspectors in a single plant, why don't we 
have at least one in a seafood plant?" 
</P>
<P>
Roger Berkowitz, manager of Boston's Legal Sea Foods restaurant chain, says, 
"Fish inspection, yes, I'm all for it. An inspection by one organization would 
be a good idea. We have our own fish inspection and it is very strict. We have 
six restaurants and we consider our inspection and tests of the utmost 
importance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls for Wider Controls 
</P>
<P>
Some restaurant owners say it's not just the fish that needs inspection; the 
water it comes from and the fishing boats need some kind of standards or 
certifying. Still others say a well-developed sampling program would be too 
expensive. Could the government do a good job of it? 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Frankel, owner of the Colony restaurant in Boston, says it's how fish is 
handled on the boat that makes a difference. "Two-day-old fish is OK if it's 
been handled properly." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Loomis, a Seattle-based writer who has just written a seafood book after 
interviewing almost a hundred fishermen on their boats, says she thinks a more 
thorough program is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize there is some inspecting going on, but many processors pay for their 
own inspection," she says. "But I think there should be mandatory inspection 
for fish, since we do have it for meat and poultry and produce. It should also 
include the imported fish that is flown from ports all over the world into the 
Fulton Fish Market in New York and to some other cities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Existing Regulation 
</P>
<P>
Lee Weddig, executive vice-president of the National Fisheries Institute, sees 
the plea for mandatory fish inspection in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people may imply that this is an unregulated, uninspected industry. This 
just isn't true," Weddig says. "Fish and seafood plants are products subject to 
the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act, which mandates sanitary facilities and 
wholesome products. It is enforced by the FDA, which conducts plant and product 
inspections. Also there are state health agencies that inspect facilities and 
products and prosecute lawbreakers." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, Weddig says, is that "seafood reaches the customer in many 
different ways. The largest percentage is frozen. The next largest percentage 
is canned; then comes fresh. A small percentage is smoked or cured. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore about half the product is ready to eat," he said, speaking at a Food 
Marketing Institute conference in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost as much is cooked before consumption by the home cook or at 
restaurants. This includes the fish fillets, steaks, shrimps and lobster tails. 
Only a small percentage is eaten raw such as clams, oysters and sashimi," 
Weddig says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voluntary Inspections 
</P>
<P>
He agrees that consumption of raw fish poses special problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have concerns over environmental hazards which can cause illness," 
Weddig says. He explains that many major companies employ the National Marine 
Fisheries Service on a voluntary basis for more comprehensive inspection 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 13 billion seafood meals consumed annually in the United States, very 
few present a degree of risk more severe than other foods of animal origin," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Included in these 12 billion to 13 billion seafood servings were 5 billion to 6 
billion tuna sandwiches, salads, or casseroles; about 1.5 billion fish 
sandwiches, and several billion servings of shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Weddig points out that about 40% of our imported seafood comes from such 
countries as Canada, Iceland and Norway, which have specialized fishery product 
inspection programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fish Farming Limits Risks 
</P>
<P>
While the fishing industry still depends on a wild, natural resource, more and 
more fish and shellfish are being farm raised, with special attention to 
controlled environment and other quality measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Catfish Institute, for example, realizing that there is no mandatory 
federal inspection of seafood, adopted the Mississippi Prime Inspection Program 
in early 1988, to be conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Department of 
Commerce and the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is vitally important to establish strict standards of excellence 
for our industry, particularly when there is so much consumer concern about the 
safety of seafood," explains Bill Allen Jr., president of the Catfish 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"FDA's limited programs monitoring fish contamination fall far short of 
providing assurance that the fish Americans consume is safe," says Haas. 
</P>
<P>
A number of proposals have been introduced in Congress during the last 20 years 
to establish a mandatory fish inspection program with jurisdiction over 
inspection alternately proposed for several departments. 
</P>
<P>
Haas's Public Voice organization believes the USDA would be the agency that 
could best administer an inspection program. 
</P>
<P>
"It has one of the largest research institutions. It has technical expertise 
and significant expertise because of its experience with poultry and meat 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, while FDA has the mandate to protect the American food supply, 
that is the major mission of the USDA. A mandatory federal inspection system 
that gives one agency responsibility for its implementation would provide 
Americans with safer seafood, a potentially nutritious, low-fat source of 
protein," Haas says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seafood Safety Tips 
</P>
<P>
For safer seafood preparation, follow these steps to make sure that the fish 
and shellfish you eat are safe: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid eating raw or partly cooked seafood. Many bacteria are killed by 
adequately cooking the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Call or write the local state Department of Public Health to find out if 
local fish are contaminated. These offices often issue advisories on restricted 
areas for commercial or sport fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be particularly aware of waters near major industrial plants or those 
contaminated with "red tides." Do not eat raw seafood or shellfish from areas 
that are contaminated with either industrial chemicals or biological 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep all seafood well chilled, between 32 degrees and 40 degrees. All 
seafood contains some bacteria that can multiply quickly in temperatures above 
40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not store unfrozen fish more than a few days. Fish and shellfish will 
ultimately deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use most frozen seafood within three months. Frozen oily fish have about 
half the shelf life of frozen lean fish. Use them within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep the freezer as cold as possible, don't crowd it and avoid opening the 
door unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Purchase fish and shellfish from reputable dealers with proper storage and 
handling facilities.

Edward M. Brecher, 77, a writer who argued in favor of the right to end one's 
life at a time and in a manner of one's own choosing. Brecher wrote "Opting for 
Suicide" for The New York Times Magazine in 1979 after he had contracted cancer 
of the colon the previous year. He also was the author of numerous books and 
articles on medical, scientific and social subjects. For much of his long 
writing career, Brecher collaborated on books and articles with his wife, Ruth 
Ernestine Cook Brecher, who died in 1966. They received the Albert Lasker Award 
for medical journalism in 1963. The couple wrote "An Analysis of Human Sexual 
Response," a 1966 version for the general public of Masters and Johnson's 
"Human Sexual Response." Among his later works were "The Sex Researchers," 
"Licit and Illicit Drugs" and "Love, Sex and Aging." In Cornwall, Conn., on

Photo, Teachers Take Strike Vote Teachers at Adams Junior High School were 
among thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District teachers, counselors, 
nurses and librarians who cast ballots Wednesday to decide whether they should 
strike on May 30. Union President Wayne Johnson said he hopes that the results, 
to be announced Monday, will show at least 65% of the union's 22,000 members in 
favor of a walkout. More than 16,000 teachers voted March 7 to reject the 
district's last offer and authorize a strike, but a date was not specified. The 
district has offered teachers a 20% raise over three years; the union is 
pressing for a 21% increase over two years. Also at issue are proposals to give 
elementary teachers a paid preparation period and create school councils that 
would give teachers more authority on how schools are run. LARRY DAVIS / Los

"What I can't understand is why I'm a danger to society," Bridges, 23, a former 
child star of the NBC-TV series "Diff'rent Strokes," told Judge David Horowitz. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges is charged with attempted murder in the shooting of a 25-year-old man 
who was allegedly serving as a lookout at a South-Central Los Angeles rock 
house Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz turned down the defense request to lower Bridges' bail to $50,000 and 
ordered him to remain in custody pending a May 19 pretrial hearing.

Should the lyric in "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" be changed to: "Buy me some 
salads and granola bars?" 
</P>
<P>
Encino attorney Harold Fleischman might not mind. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischman recently wrote to Peter O'Malley, the Dodgers' Big Enchilada, asking 
that the club give fans the "opportunity of purchasing healthy, non-cholesterol 
foods in addition to your standard menu items." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that San Francisco's Candlestick Park began offering such 
delicacies as meatless dogs, salads, yogurt and mineral water this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I started the Pritikin diet, I have to pack my own lunch when I go to a 
game," Fleischman said. "It's a little irritating. And I'm sure there are 
thousands of other fans in L.A. who would agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
One of those might be the Dodgers' corpulent Tom Lasorda, who is reputed to be 
on a low-cholesterol diet. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley wrote back to Fleischman, saying, "We are studying this carefully." 
But, he added, somewhat ominously, "I hope the idea is practical." 
</P>
<P>
From the Queen Mary to Mother Russia: 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills City Councilman Tom Heinsheimer, who helped revive the 
long-dormant Gordon Bennett International balloon race a decade ago in Long 
Beach, is going to sail in a Soviet edition of the competition in July. 
</P>
<P>
"They are interested in developing the sport of ballooning, as well as doing 
more research into various procedures for their planned balloon exploration of 
Mars in 1994," said Heinsheimer, an atmospheric scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The Gordon Bennett, whose domestic version will lift off from Palm Springs this 
weekend, seems to be the latest beneficiary of glasnost. The event has come 
full circle since the Cold War days, when a Polish team showed up unscheduled 
in Long Beach for one race. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicions that the Poles were more interested in surveillance of Southern 
California by car than in racing through the air surfaced when their balloon 
was unpacked and found to contain about 75 holes. 
</P>
<P>
What ground data they collected may never be known. But, in the air, the 
patched-up Poles finished last in that Gordon Bennett, setting off from the 
parking lot of the Queen Mary and plopping down a few hours later near a dump 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Only 249 shopping days until . . . Pagan Day! 
</P>
<P>
A group called Truth Missions, angered at the Christmas tree and menorah on 
display at Los Angeles City Hall each December, is petitioning the city for the 
right to set up an atheist/pagan exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Dueling chauffeurs: 
</P>
<P>
The two limousine drivers were vying for the same prized possession, a parking 
space at a Lucky supermarket in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
During the standoff, one jockey brandished a BB gun that had been customized to 
look like an old-fashioned .45-caliber revolver, witnesses told Police Sgt. 
John Berry. 
</P>
<P>
The other driver responded, "I'll show you a real weapon," and flashed a loaded 
shotgun, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
The BB gunman fled. The shotgun chauffeur should have done the same. Witnesses 
called police, who arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
Those Good Samaritans may get commendations from city officials, but a Wells 
Fargo bank customer has received more rewarding recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The customer, who was instrumental in the capture of two alleged robbers, has 
been awarded 25 shares of the company's stock, a bank spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The do-gooder, who wished to remain anonymous, observed the crime, followed the 
alleged robbers at a safe distance and then signaled police. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal of the Senses, a publication of Topanga's Elysium Institute, 
reports what may be the first nudist pen-pal club. Its headquarters are in 
daring Canoga Park.

<P>
And no, photos needn't accompany the letters.

CONDOR HATCHED AT PARK AFTER 63 HOURS OF PECKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mandan, the second California condor to be conceived and born in captivity, is 
sleeping peacefully after its 63-hour pecking ordeal Wednesday, officials at 
the San Diego Wild Animal Park said. 
</P>
<P>
The bird began its entry into the world at 11 p.m. Sunday, when it "pipped," 
said Tom Hanscom, spokesman at the Wild Animal Park. The chick hatched at 2:02 
p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Experience shows that (the bird) will hatch between 60 and 72 hours after the 
'pip,' or the point at which the chick pokes an air hole," Hanscom said. "It 
leaves the shell quite exhausted by the hatch process. We help quite a bit. We 
basically chip half to two-thirds of the shell away, small piece by piece, 
until more or less we can turn the egg and pull it free." 
</P>
<P>
The chick, which hatched after 57 days of incubation, is resting after 
undergoing minor surgery for a stomach opening after the hatching. 
</P>
<P>
The opening usually closes itself in a few hours, Hanscom said, but because it 
is a condor, officials wanted to take extra precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the hole is wide. We wanted no opportunity for the introduction of 
infection," Hanscom said. "We gave it a stitch or two to make sure it was 
closed to the point that infection does not have the opportunity to enter the 
bird's body." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surgery Often Necessary 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cunningham, assistant curator of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, said 
surgery is often necessary to remove unused portions of the yolk sac, to which 
the bird's umbilical cord is attached, if a chick is hatched too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom said that park officials are careful to go slow. 
</P>
<P>
"If hatching were rushed, it would hold the threat of blood vessel breakage. We 
want to hatch it after the blood vessels are internalized but before the bird 
has overexerted itself physically." 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom said that they won't know if Mandan is a male or female for another six 
to eight weeks, when they will perform blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small, inactive chick, has hair-like feathers which are matted down by 
the albumen still present from the egg and the water, which we spray on the 
chick to keep it loosened within the shell. It will begin to fluff up in about 
a day, and it will show a great deal of activity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom added that the digestive functions of the bird will be closely 
monitored. It will be given its first meal -- minced mice mixed with egg yolk 
-- today, and will be hand-fed for the first two days before being raised by 
condor-like puppets. 
</P>
<P>
The chick was named by California Department of Fish and Game biologists after 
the American Indian tribe native to the eastern Rockies, Hanscom said. Mandan 
is the sibling of Molloko, the chick born to UN-1 and AC-4 in March 1988. The 
pair also laid an egg April 9, which was found to be fertile a few days later 
and is expected to hatch in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Seven eggs have been laid by condors this year: Four were fertile, two were 
infertile and one was broken in the nest. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining condors, which now total 29, are divided between the Los Angeles 
Zoo and the Wild Animal Park. They are part of a breeding program to replenish 
the nearly extinct species by eventually releasing the huge birds into the 
California condor range.

EFFORT BEING LAUNCHED TO FORGE PORT TENANTS INTO A LOBBYING FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of tenants of the San Diego Unified Port District, saying that a 
unified voice would strengthen their influence with the port commissioners, 
will meet today in an effort to form an association to represent them. As many 
as 60 representatives of port leaseholders are expected to attend the meeting, 
said one of the organizers, Ray Carpenter, president of R. E. Staite 
Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said the meeting is the result of years of informal discussion with 
other tenants. But the recent growth of San Diego, and particularly large-scale 
development in the port area, spurred interest in forming a tenant group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth a Concern 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days of the port, there were a lot of owner-operators," Carpenter 
said Wednesday. "They didn't have time to look up from their work. But, with 
the tremendous growth in Southern California in the last 10 to 15 years, and 
the potential for even more growth, the tenants have come to the conclusion 
that it is time we had a say in what happens with the port. 
</P>
<P>
"As tenants, we produce millions of dollars in revenue to the port, yet we have 
no say in how the port solves problems or where the port is headed. We thought 
it was time to get together and make our feelings known." 
</P>
<P>
The group mailed a letter to about 120 tenants two weeks ago, asking them to 
attend today's initial meeting at the San Diego Marriott. The letter was signed 
by Carpenter and Kipland Howard, president of Torrey Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter and Howard represent two of the more significant tenants. R. E. 
Staite Engineering, on 3 1/2 acres of port property on Harbor Drive, has done 
business on the waterfront for 50 years. Torrey Enterprises, whose general 
partner is developer Doug Manchester, owns the San Diego Marriott and plans to 
build a 39-story Hyatt Regency Hotel on adjoining port land between the 
Marriott and Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
An informal sampling of port tenants Wednesday showed most taking a cautious 
approach to the idea. Several said they plan to send observers to the meeting. 
Some expressed concern that the group not become a mouthpiece for a few 
powerful port tenants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rent, Pollution on List 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter and Howard said no specific issue or problem prompted them to form 
the group, rather it had been an idea whose time had come. Howard said possible 
areas of discussion for the group include rent, pollution in the San Diego Bay 
and the pace and mix of port development. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just amazing to me that there has not been this type of organization 
formed before," Howard said. "It is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Several groups, such as associations on Harbor and Shelter islands, represent 
smaller interests in the port, but organizers said this will be the first 
attempt to put together a port-wide lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wilkins, a Port District spokesman, said the district is aware of the 
organizational meeting but is taking a wait-and-see approach. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said he has not targeted specific major tenants nor decided how many 
charter members he believes it will take to make the organization viable. But 
he said it is important that the group represent a variety of tenants and their 
interests, be they large or small. This would include such diverse groups as 
retail, commercial, fishing and industrial tenants. He said there might be as 
many as 400 potential members who hold leases with the Port District.

NIXON PARDON

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Shogan's article "Historians Tending to Support Pardon of Nixon" (Part 
I, April 8) notwithstanding, I still believe that President Gerald Ford's 
action was a mistake of historic dimension for at least two important reasons: 
</P>
<P>
1. The pardon gives precedential support to the idea that presidents are above 
the law. Please, let us continue to restrict membership in our nobility to 
noted entertainers and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
2. The pardon cut off a most promising investigation of high-level politics as 
conducted in the U.S. I see no reason why Richard Nixon's testimony could not 
have been required under a grant of immunity. To me, self-knowledge as a nation 
is much more important than the transient embarrassment of politicians and 
their hangers-on.

ELECTRIC CARS

When I was a little kid in Chicago, my friend Frank lived with his mother 
around the corner in a house with a garage, which housed a black electric 
sedan. It ran almost noiselessly, seated three, had a top speed of about 30, 
and a range of (let's say) 50 miles. In other words, it was absolutely perfect 
for city driving. When Frank's mother came home from shopping, visiting, or 
whatever, she recharged this marvelous contraption by plugging it into a garage 
socket.

CLOSING COUNTY JUVENILE CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The typical inmate in one of the county's 14 juvenile camps, slated for closure 
if the governor's proposal for drastic cuts in state aid to counties (Metro, 
April 11) goes into effect, is a 16-year-old gang member who has been arrested 
three times for robbery. He has committed a crime and is being punished, but is 
also getting a good education behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of education the juvenile camp inmates receive can make the difference 
in the kind of lives they lead upon release. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to go back to being a car thief once you've been Sleeping Beauty." 
That's what a teen-age inmate of a camp told her drama teacher after performing 
in a school play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to start my own business. The same day I made my decision, I got 
word I could graduate at the Hollywood Bowl. That was the best day of my life." 
No ordinary high school senior made this statement. This student might never 
have graduated if a judge had not sentenced him to a juvenile probation camp, 
where he attended class on a regular basis for the first time since elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
If the camps close, where will the kids go? Will they be released early back to 
schools and communities not ready for them, where their histories of failure 
and crime will be repeated? 
</P>
<P>
Where will they receive the education they need in order to turn their lives 
around? The alternative to camp placement is the already overburdened 
California Youth Authority system, where the costs are three times what it 
costs to keep a youthful offender in a camp. The instructional program at CYA 
does not compare to that in the camp schools operated by the L.A. County Office 
of Education -- a fully accredited, individualized education program that 
results in two months of academic gain for each month of enrollment and gives 
kids like "Sleeping Beauty" the first enriched learning experiences of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 students graduated from camp schools last year. These graduates 
are now in colleges, in trade schools, or employed. 
</P>
<P>
Take away the camps and we take away the best option available to the juvenile 
court judges for these kids. Take away the camps and we destory the best 
educational chance these kids have. Take away the camps and we do an injustice 
to the kids and to the community.

BILL TO PROTECT MOUNTAIN LIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fur has been flying since the moratorium, enacted in 1972, that provided 
protection for the California mountain lion expired in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game took advantage of the opportunity 
and has announced a plan to reopen the hunting season of this persecuted wild 
creature. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation is continuing between the animal activists and the trophy 
hunters, who have eliminated the wolves, jaguars and grizzly bears in 
California and are responsible for the demise of the California condor. Now 
they are determined to rid the California wilderness of the last remaining 
major predator, the cougar. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain lion had been decimated by bounty hunters and their cohorts, the 
trophy hunters, to a mere 600 by 1972, necessitating a moratorium on hunting in 
order to save the species. Unlike other game animals, the cougar is not hunted 
for fur and it is not being used for food. The reason that the trophy hunters 
are itching to snuff out the life of the big cat is to satisfy their desire to 
kill for "fun and/or recreation," and because of their beauty to use them as 
decorations on their living room walls. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for this bloody sport is that the innate, primitive instinct of 
the Neanderthal man is still inherent in the computer-age man, wanting to 
eliminate his fellow predator, competing for the same quarry. We called 
American Indians "savages," but they only took what they needed in order to 
survive and never killed for sport. We boast about being civilized. Is it 
civilized to chase a panicked wild creature with a pack of hounds up a tree and 
then shoot the helpless animal? I would call this barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
The only solution to restrain those uncaring individuals from continuing to 
lobby for mountain lion hunting tags is to enact state laws that would put an 
end to the feud. There is a ray of hope now for this persecuted species. AB 860 
has been introduced in the California Legislature to provide much-needed 
protection for the big cat. Unfortunately, such attempts in the past have 
failed. Two years ago a bill passed after bouncing from one committee to 
another but died on the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Let us try again. Only the general public can swing the pendulum in the right 
direction. We should bombard our legislators in Sacramento to vote for the 
passage of AB 860 to assure the survival of this predator.

STUDENT LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your editorial "Stemming Student Loan Defaults" (April 7), please let 
us encourage responsibility. When a student takes out a loan to help with his 
college education, he is making a commitment and a pledge to repay that loan! 
Go after the $2 billion in loans that are not being paid back! 
</P>
<P>
Again, the "good guy" who is being responsible and pays his or her bills 
doesn't get any encouragement, but we're just supposed to find all kinds of 
excuses for acts of irresponsibility. We must restore values and promote 
responsibility or this generation of beautiful young people is doomed. Let us 
wake up before it is too late!

BIG BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly every day I read of a gang- or drug-related shooting incident on our 
city streets. I'm amazed at how young some of the boys are that are involved in 
these problems. I'm probably not wrong to assume that many of these kids come 
from single-parent (read mother only) households. 
</P>
<P>
I like to feel that I'm contributing in a small way to preventing some of these 
problems. I'm a Big Brother to two fatherless, brotherless young Chicano boys. 
We have a great time together and I feel I'm a positive influence in their 
lives. Their mom certainly thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Big Brother organizations, including mine, Catholic Big Brothers, 
desperately need more volunteer men. We have great group activities and 
outings, and it's also a good networking opportunity on the adult-to-adult 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Next time one of you guys see our "It takes a big man to be a big brother" 
billboards around town, please call.

ST. JOSEPH TO PULL OUT OF TRAUMA SYSTEM JUNE 19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing annual losses of up to $2 million and accusing Gov. George Deukmejian of 
"hijacking" health care funds, officials at St. Joseph Medical Center in 
Burbank announced Wednesday that they will end the hospital's involvement with 
Los Angeles County's trauma care network June 19. 
</P>
<P>
In formally announcing the move, administrator James Sauer said the hospital is 
not being adequately reimbursed by state and federal agencies for providing 
health services. He also said the closure is due to trauma center operating 
costs and the cost of providing care to an increasing number of indigent 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
With St. Joseph's pullout, eight hospitals have quit the trauma care network 
since its inception in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Sauer criticized Deukmejian for withholding Proposition 99 funds that he said 
should have been targeted for health care. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Joseph Medical Center contends that if the Proposition 99 issue is not 
resolved and the funds not released, there will be a continued exodus of 
hospitals from the trauma system, possible downsizing of basic emergency 
services in other hospitals and, ultimately, a continued deterioration of the 
availability of health care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 was approved by voters in November and placed a 25-cent-a-pack 
tax increase on cigarettes. Sauer said $650 million from the collected taxes 
should have gone to provide health care for the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
But Sauer said Deukmejian has diverted the funds for purposes other than health 
care. "He has hijacked the funds and changed the will of the people," he said. 
"It's unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers are designed to treat people suffering critical injuries from 
auto accidents, falls and violent incidents. Each trauma center in the network 
is required to have a neurosurgeon and other trauma-care specialists on duty 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph is treating 650 trauma cases a year, Sauer said. About 20% of those 
are brought to the hospital from outside the assigned zone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When it entered the network, the hospital only expected to handle 350 cases per 
year, he said. He said 60% of its trauma care costs are not compensated by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed 22 Times 
</P>
<P>
Sauer added that the trauma center had to close 22 times in January because of 
a lack of beds. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said St. Joseph lost $1.5 million in 1987 and predicted that 
losses in 1988 would reach $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sauer said that although the hospital was dropping out of the network, it would 
continue to treat trauma and emergency cases. Although trauma-care specialists 
would not be on duty 24 hours a day, they could be reached by beepers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital would become more of a community facility, and "no one 
would be turned away" due to their inability to pay for care.

ROADS PANEL TO ACT TODAY ON NEW VENTURA FREEWAY LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If state transportation officials give their approval today, work could begin 
as early as October on widening the heavily congested Ventura Freeway through 
the heart of the San Fernando Valley, highway planners said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The $41.3-million widening project, which still might be held up if clean-air 
crusaders follow through on a threat to sue, is to be considered by the 
California Transportation Commission, which is meeting today in the northern 
California city of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners, who are appointed by the governor, are expected to approve the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coalition for Clean Air, which last year vowed to block the freeway 
widening in court unless it was redesigned to include a "diamond lane" 
restricted to vehicles with more than one occupant, will not decide until next 
week whether to sue. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for the Santa Monica-based organization indicated 
Wednesday that the group's determination to sue seems to be wavering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue Fought 2 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling among some of our people that this issue was fought and lost 
two years ago and ought not to be reopened," said Jan Chatten-Brown, president 
of the coalition, which 11 months ago filed the legally required notice of 
intent to sue Caltrans on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans planners say that redesigning the project to include a diamond lane 
would take at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-month project calls for the Ventura Freeway, which varies from 8 to 10 
lanes, to be widened to a uniform 10 lanes from Topanga Canyon Boulevard in 
Woodland Hills to Universal City and then south on the Hollywood Freeway to 
Lankershim Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
To lessen the impact on the 277,000 vehicles that use the freeway daily, most 
work would be done at night. 
</P>
<P>
But many on- and off-ramps would be closed at different times, "inconveniencing 
some motorists," said Mark Archuleta, Caltrans project engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The new lanes would be created by shrinking the existing 12-foot-wide lanes by 
one foot each and using the median. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been delayed for years by a shortage of funds and by a fierce 
debate over whether the new eastbound fifth lane should be a diamond lane. 
</P>
<P>
The new westbound fifth lane was designated as a general-use lane from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans initially promoted creation of an eastbound restricted-use lane as a 
means to increase the freeway's capacity by inducing motorists to share rides. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a restricted lane, Caltrans officials said, the freeway will 
return to heavy congestion within a year or two after it is widened. 
</P>
<P>
But in the face of 12,000 mailed protests, mostly from West Valley and Ventura 
County residents, Caltrans in February, 1987, backed away and said the lane 
would be open to all vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the Federal 
Highway Administration have unsuccessfully sought to force Caltrans to include 
a diamond lane in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The clean air coalition contends that the federal Clean Air Act requires the 
construction of 74 miles of diamond lanes, including a Ventura Freeway lane, 
because the network is included in the region's 1979 Air Quality Management 
Plan. The coalition has successfully sued regional agencies on clean-air issues 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, which has three diamond lanes in California and is building or 
studying more than a dozen others, contends that such lanes are needed because 
the state has neither the money nor the room to expand existing freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that the lanes are unproven as a device for inducing motorists 
to form car pools or ride buses, and that they are unfair to those who travel 
at varying times and cannot share rides.

MAKING AMENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The furor in the Vietnamese community that followed the unfortunate and 
misguided remark last week by Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr. has 
subsided. An air of normalcy seems to have been restored. And community leaders 
have been able to use the mistake to face directly those pockets of prejudice 
that persist. 
</P>
<P>
When Fry, in voting to deny a parade permit being sought by a group of 
Vietnamese veterans, told them, "If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to 
South Vietnam," he stirred many emotions. The ripple effect of his insensitive 
remark even reached back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County generally, and in Westminster in particular, the reaction was 
strong. Vietnamese refugees were outraged. In a matter of days they had printed 
up more than 5,000 flyers and 500 posters critical of Fry and were ready to 
launch a campaign to recall him from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Orange County Human Relations Commission moved in. Quickly and 
decisively -- led by Rusty Kennedy, its executive director, and Dr. Daniel H. 
Ninburg, its chairman -- the commission met with Fry and Vietnamese leaders and 
deterred further divisiveness and bitter reactions. Fry apologized, and the 
Vietnamese leaders, who wanted that public apology, accepted it, called off 
their recall effort and expressed their hope for greater harmony in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans group that was planning the parade as part of a June Vietnamese 
holiday, which is similar to the American Memorial Day holiday, will meet 
Friday to discuss what to do next about the march that is intended to honor all 
the soldiers, foreign and Vietnamese, who fought the communists in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling in the county is not the same as it was before Fry's remark. It is 
a troubling reality -- but nevertheless a reality -- that some harbor prejudice 
against Southeast Asian refugees. The prejudice usually lies dormant until an 
intolerant remark or public action brings it to the surface and then the old 
myths and misconceptions are heard again, including indignation about special 
low-interest loan programs that never existed and complaints about special 
treatment given Southeast Asian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
This time was no different, but the hostility seemed to be less virulent and 
widespread than on some occasions in the past. And the new residents, many of 
them American citizens, reacted responsibly in the face of the inexcusable 
provocation. 
</P>
<P>
As one Vietnamese leader said, praising Fry for his public apology, the 
Vietnamese community regretted Fry's remarks but "it's forgivable" and "it's 
forgettable." The entire community could benefit from that same attitude, and 
also make Fry's remark and the passions of divisive prejudice forgettable as 
well.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sailor was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury on charges of receiving 
explosives and attempting to mail them in a cigarette package. 
</P>
<P>
Dana James Hulse, 19, from Whitney Point, N.Y., will be arraigned in the next 
few days on the felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hulse was to be transferred from Navy custody to the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center soon, said Assistant U.S. Atty. John Kraemer. 
</P>
<P>
Kraemer said the explosive material was found in Hulse's barracks. An empty 
cigarette package contained components that could explode if mixed with other 
chemicals possessed by Hulse, Kraemer said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor declined to name the intended victim. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Hulse received sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate 
in December, with the knowledge that such chemicals could cause an explosion 
that could kill a person or damage a building.

DELAHOYA ALL BUSINESS FOR GRANT, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Javier Delahoya, it was a nine-to-five kind of day. 
</P>
<P>
The Grant High right-hander had nine strikeouts -- five of them on called third 
strikes -- to lead the Lancers to a 5-2 Valley Pac-8 Conference victory 
Wednesday over visiting Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very businesslike and that's what we want him to be," Grant Coach Tom 
Lucero said of Delahoya, who yielded just four singles and four walks. "We want 
him to pitch with no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"This was his best game of the year. He had his best control." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya (4-1) spent the afternoon fooling Monroe batters with an effective 
changeup, set up by a powerful fastball. And he was on guard through the game's 
last pitch. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh inning and Monroe's Ernesto Echeveste at first, 
Delahoya snared Tony Rolando's sharp grounder -- not a moment too soon before 
it rocketed through the box -- and fired to shortstop Jim Tumbeiro, who relayed 
to first for a game-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little tired at the end," Delahoya said. "But not too much. I felt 
good today. I changed speeds and they didn't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
The final out left an eager Tim Costic (4-1) standing in the on-deck circle 
holding a bat and saddled him with his first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"He made me look stupid in the (Holt-Goodman) tournament," Costic said of 
Delahoya. "Struck me out three times." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's defense didn't make Costic look much better; he was the victim of four 
unearned runs. In the third inning, Grant (10-3, 7-2 in league play) scored the 
game's first run when shortstop Mike Enriquez, attempting to complete a double 
play, overthrew first baseman Sean Henson, allowing Jamey Ekerling to score. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Grant scored four runs, three on a bases-clearing double by Steve 
Pelote. Three batters earlier, right fielder Jeff Rubell dropped Delahoya's fly 
ball, which would have been the second out of the inning. With Pelote on deck, 
Rubell caught Raul Montero's fly ball for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
"That killed us," Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell said. "That lets the guy up to 
hit the double." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also lamented the Vikings' inability to get the bat off their 
shoulders against Delahoya. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you strike out looking, it's your fault," he said. "Especially with 
people in scoring position. You gotta put the ball in play with two strikes, 
regardless." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe (8-5, 6-3) pressured Delahoya in the sixth, scoring twice on a one-out 
single by Adam Clark and a bases-loaded walk to Josh Lawrence. But Delahoya 
quelled the rally by striking out Henson on a called third strike with the 
bases loaded.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: INJURED LEUZINGER ACE WILL TRY TO PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leuzinger pitcher Tyrone Scott, considered one of the South Bay's top major 
league baseball prospects and the key to the Olympians' hopes for a Bay League 
title, has a sore arm. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Derrel Thomas said Scott's injury, which he described as "tenderness of 
the elbow," may prevent the left-hander from pitching indefinitely. Scott has 
not pitched since April 11 when he first complained of soreness in a poor 
outing against Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Scott missed his scheduled start Tuesday in Leuzinger's 6-3 Bay League loss to 
Palos Verdes but will try to pitch in today's rematch with the Sea Kings at 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to warm up," Thomas said. "If his elbow is still tender, I won't 
let him pitch. Then we'll take it from there. If it's that bad, he has to go to 
the doctor and get it checked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyrone wants to play major league baseball someday, and I feel he has a chance 
to do that. I don't want anything to happen that could endanger his future." 
</P>
<P>
The erratic Scott, who has continued to play center field and bat third, is 4-2 
with a 1.59 ERA and leads the South Bay with 72 strikeouts and 54 walks in 44 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger was regarded as a contender for the Bay League title before the 
season but is struggling in a fifth-place tie at 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside forward Eddie Scott, whose cousin Byron played basketball at 
Arizona State before finding fame and fortune with the Lakers, also will play 
collegiately in the Grand Canyon state. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-7 Scott signed a letter of intent with Northern Arizona on Tuesday, the 
day before his 19th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people want to go to a big-name college with big-time players, but they 
don't get any playing time," Scott said. "Northern Arizona is giving me a 
chance to come in and start." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is considered a small college in basketball circles, Northern 
Arizona competes on the Division I level. The school's recruiting efforts in 
the South Bay also netted Harbor College guard Keith Billingslea. 
</P>
<P>
Scott needs to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to be eligible as a 
freshman, but he said Northern Arizona will accept him even if he has to sit 
out next year. He has two more chances to take the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Scott averaged a team-high 14.7 points a game and led Morningside (25-6) to the 
Ocean League championship, the semifinals of Southern Section 3-A playoffs and 
the finals of the Southern California Division III regionals. He was named 
Ocean League MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills made it two-for-two in recruiting Carson High's top 
basketball players by signing 6-5 forward Vincent Washington to a letter of 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Toros landed Carson guard Ray Bennett. Washington and Bennett 
were members of The Times South Bay All-Star Team. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited about each of our signees," said Dominguez Hills Coach 
Dave Yanai, who also signed 6-7 center Cesar Uballe of Bell and 6-5 forward 
Norm Francis of Fairfax. "They are well-rounded players who will contribute 
immediately while making an impact in our program over the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
Washington averaged 17 points and 8.3 rebounds to help Carson win the Pacific 
League title and reach the semifinals of the L.A. City 4-A playoffs. He was 
named the Pacific League MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa took a commanding two-game lead in the Ocean League volleyball race 
Tuesday with a 15-5, 15-8, 15-4 victory over visiting North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, improved to 
11-0 overall and 9-0 in league behind the play of middle blocker Pat Ivie. 
Second-place North fell to 7-2 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa will venture north for a pair of non-league matches against 
10th-ranked Santa Barbara and Dos Pueblos on Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Cook's Mustangs are gearing up for the competitive Redondo 
Tournament on April 29. The 25-team field includes Corona del Mar, ranked 
fourth in 4-A; University of Irvine, ranked sixth; Palisades, defending L.A. 
City 4-A champion, and three of the top-ranked teams in the Southern Section 
3-A Division: Harvard of North Hollywood, Arcadia and Long Beach Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance and West Torrance will play an alumni football game, the 
schools' third in the last five years, at 7 p.m. May 20 at North. 
</P>
<P>
North alumni interested in playing are asked to meet April 27 at the school 
football stadium or call the school at 533-4416. The team will be coached by 
Kelsey Baughfman, a former North player and an assistant coach for the Saxons. 
</P>
<P>
North has won the last two meetings with West. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Bishop Montgomery junior Kelly Wood was chosen to the

STILLWELL TO RESIGN BASEBALL POST AT MOORPARK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Stillwell said Wednesday that he will resign as baseball coach at Moorpark 
College effective at the end of the season. Stillwell, who has taught physical 
education at Thousand Oaks High for 25 years, is in his fifth season at 
Moorpark on a walk-on basis. 
</P>
<P>
Stillwell, whose team is 20-13 overall and 9-7 in Western State Conference play 
this season, said that he is resigning because maintaining the program without 
being on the Moorpark campus full time has its drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very difficult doing the job I would like to do as a walk-on 
coach," Stillwell said. "I race from Thousand Oaks to Moorpark and arrive at 
the ballpark 25 minutes before the first pitch. This is just a very stressful 
and unsettling way to try and coach and I just can't do it anymore." 
</P>

BISHOP MONTGOMERY STRANDS 10, BOWS TO MATER DEI NINE, 5-0 
</P>

<P>
Throw out one bad inning in Bishop Montgomery's 5-0 loss to Mater Dei on 
Wednesday night at Torrance Park and the Knights still would have lost. 
</P>
<P>
But that second inning, when the visiting Monarchs scored three unearned runs 
on three Bishop Montgomery errors, set the tone for a game. 
</P>
<P>
From then, Mater Dei would get the timely hits while the Knights couldn't do 
anything with pitcher Tony Pena. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery had just five hits in the contest but stranded 10 runners and 
committed four errors. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's just very frustrating," said Bishop Montgomery Coach Bob 
Anderson. "When you leave as many runners on base as we did, you're not going 
to win many baseball games. We weren't able to string any hits together and 
that was definitely the difference in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights threatened in the first when they strung together two hits and a 
walk off Pena (7-0). However, they came away empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Kirrer led off the Mater Dei second with a double, followed by Ryan 
Anderson's infield hit. Vic Boyd grounded into a fielder's choice, scoring 
Kirrer. Anderson, who had advanced to second on a wild pitch, went to third. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Carl hit a sharp liner that left fielder Andrew Branch misplayed into a 
two-base error, scoring Anderson. Carl stole third and came home on pitcher 
Erik Russell's second wild pitch of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Branch relieved Russell to start the third and was effective, but the damage 
had been done and Pena had all the runs he needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of mechanical problems today," said Russell (2-3). "I was not 
pitching like I should and I was probably a little nervous because we were 
playing Mater Dei and all." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights had beaten Mater Dei once before, handing the Monarchs their lone 
Angelus League loss, and draw Mater Dei again on Saturday in the rubber match 
of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei improved to 6-1 in league while Bishop Montgomery fell to 3-4. The 
Knights are still secure in third place in the league standings. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to go out and regroup and put this one behind us," Anderson 
said. "Armando Cervantes, our guy who beat them the first time, is pitching 
again Saturday, and hopefully the results will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Dudley Callahan had two hits for Bishop Montgomery, while Kirrer 
was three for four and Carl two for three for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo 11, Mira Costa 8 -- Brian Davison's lead-off triple ignited a six-run 
outburst in the seventh inning that carried the Sea Hawks to an Ocean League 
victory at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Mike Houck followed Davison with a single to snap a 5-5 tie, 
and Redondo scored five more runs on a single by Ian Martin, two Mira Costa 
errors, a hit batter, a walk and a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo finished with 11 hits against Mira Costa pitchers Jason Garner and 
Bobby Dominguez, neither of whom could get his curve over for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just gave it away," said Mira Costa Coach Jim Beaumont, whose team 
squandered a 5-3 lead. "But I have to give Redondo credit because they hit the 
ball well." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, which scored three runs in the bottom of the seventh, stayed a half 
game ahead of Redondo in second place in the Ocean standings at 5-2. The 
Mustangs are 9-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Houck paced Redondo (8-9, 4-2) with a double, two singles and two RBIs, and 
Davison went two for four with one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance 6, South Torrance 1 -- John Clem's two-run single highlighted a 
four-run first inning and right-hander Ty Tout blanked South on three hits 
through six innings as the Saxons reached the .500 mark for the first time this 
season with an Ocean League win at home. 
</P>
<P>
North, which struggled earlier in the year, improved to 8-8-1 overall and 4-3 
in league play with its fifth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 6-0, North Coach Mike Neily pulled Tout (2-1) in the seventh for 
reliever Brian Dessert, who gave up a home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons scored all of their runs in the first two innings. Clem was three 
for three with two runs scored and a stolen base, his 17th of the year. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 7, St. Anthony 0 -- Senior right-hander Al Ibarra pitched a 
two-hitter and Dan Melendez went three for three, including his eighth home run 
of the season, in an easy Camino Real League victory at St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez's solo shot to left-center field in the fifth inning was his 27th 
career home run, leaving him five behind the CIF-Southern Section record of 32 
set by Scott Sharts of Simi Valley in 1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez finished with two RBIs and two stolen bases, while Jeff Richardson 
contributed an RBI single and two stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra (3-1) struck out six in one of his best outings of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Banning 15, Dorsey 2 -- James Gonzales drove in four runs and sophomore Raul 
Diaz had three RBIs to power a 15-hit attack for the Pilots in a 
Southern-Pacific Conference win at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Espinoza led the Pilots with three hits in five at-bats, including a 
double, and had two RBIs as Banning increased its league-leading record to 7-2 
and overall mark to 11-6. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Jesus Olea pitched five innings for the victory, allowing two runs 
on three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City 19, West Torrance 7 -- The Centaurs collected 11 hits and 15 walks 
off three West pitchers en route to a runaway Ocean League win at West. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mitchell went three for five with two RBIs and Todd Steverson hit a two-run 
homer for Culver City (7-0 in league play). West fell to 4-12 overall and 3-4 
in the league.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former World Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion Tony Tubbs meets Mike Evans in a 
10-round fight tonight at the Strand in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first fight for Tubbs (25-2) since being knocked out in two rounds 
by Mike Tyson last March in Tokyo. Tubbs, 30, is ranked seventh by the World 
Boxing Council, while Evans (17-2) is 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Tubbs, 225 pounds, won the title from Greg Page on a 15-round unanimous 
decision on April 29, 1985, but lost a majority decision to Tim Witherspoon in 
his next bout nine months later. Evans is expected to fight at 250. 
</P>
<P>
The five-bout card, beginning at 7:30 p.m., includes three fights with South 
Bay boxers. Carson junior welterweight Hedgmon Robertson (25-4) will face Steve 
Lewis (14-5), Redondo Beach super middleweight Troy Emerson (6-2) opposes Tom 
Lillard in a four-round bout and Redondo Beach heavyweight Jimmy Ellis, a 
former football standout at Redondo High, faces Darren Etheridge. The other 
bout matches heavyweights Troy Baudoin and Tim Mixon in their pro debuts.

CAL LUTHERAN HITS ROAD AND ROAD HITS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe they should have taken the hint. Travel was just not in the master plan 
for the Cal Lutheran baseball team last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
First, the team was informed that school vans would not be available for a trip 
to Westmont College near Santa Barbara because they already had been reserved 
by other teams. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Coach Rich Hill arranged for the squad to travel by a makeshift 
caravan consisting of a "1970-something" Ford station wagon, an early model 
Oldsmobile and Hill's own Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
Strike two. The Oldsmobile didn't make it out of the school parking lot without 
needing a jump start. 
</P>
<P>
Once the team hit the road its problems continued to mount. Hill's Honda, which 
was carrying the coaching staff, blew its water pump just west of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
After borrowing a wrench from a Caltrans worker, Kingsmen pitcher Jay Anderson 
got the car started again. 
</P>
<P>
But the quick fix was only temporary. A few more miles down the road the car 
began to overheat and Hill once again was forced to pull over. 
</P>
<P>
With game time quickly approaching, the coaches hitched a ride -- "with some 
guy driving a Ford Bronco," Hill said -- and made it to the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's misfortune had not ended yet, however. Westmont swept the 
doubleheader, 3-0 and 6-3. Anderson, with a save as a mechanic to his credit, 
was unable to come through as a pitcher. He started the second game, allowed 
five runs in 4 1/3 innings and took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an eventful day," Hill said. "We had the car problems, then we got 
swept, then there was a food fight at the cafeteria where we were eating 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that Westmont students were the only ones hurling hash, which is a 
good thing. "I wouldn't have been too happy if we'd have started throwing peas 
and macaroni," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Hill did not let one bad day ruin his entire weekend. On Sunday, 
Hill and his wife Lori went back to Santa Barbara to pick up his car. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a nice time," Hill said. "We went to the (Santa Barbara) Mission, had a 
great day and made the best of a bad situation. Everything turned out all right 
except in the won-loss column." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran has lost three in a row after dropping a 6-3 decision to Southern 
California College on Tuesday. The Kingsmen (23-14 overall) are in third place 
in the Golden State Athletic Conference with an 11-6 record.

THOUSAND OAKS PITCHER TO ATTEND NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Bushart, a left-handed pitcher from Thousand Oaks High, has signed a 
letter of intent to attend Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Bushart (6-foot-4, 175 pounds) said that he selected CSUN "for the opportunity 
to pitch in my first year and because the program is on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
Bushart is the third high school player -- and the first left-handed pitcher -- 
signed this month by Coach Bill Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best senior left-hander in the Valley that I saw," Kernen said. "He 
has all the right qualities that we want to build our program around."

CORSO DECLINES OVERSEAS OFFER TO REMAIN AS HARVARD COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Corso, who coached the Harvard High water polo team to its first Southern 
Section 2-A Division championship last season, has rejected an offer to coach a 
club team in West Germany and will remain at Harvard, he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to the decision that it's best for the Corso family and American water 
polo if I stay. And for Harvard water polo," he said. "Everything I do now with 
my high school and my club team is going to put myself into a position to 
develop players for the international level." 
</P>
<P>
Corso, who lost his bid to coach the Olympic water polo team in 1992, said that 
he is planning to seek election to the 1996 team. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet your life I am," Corso said. "That's why I'm staying." TIM BROWN

IPPOLITO HANGS IN, HELIX BEATS EL CAPITAN

<P>
The seventh-ranked El Capitan baseball team looked as if it had everything it 
would need Wednesday when it played host to No. 8 Helix in a Grossmont 3-A 
League baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the Vaqueros had won six consecutive games and nine of their past 
10. El Capitan also had a team ERA of 1.87. 
</P>
<P>
For inspiration, the Vaqueros had center fielder Jeremy Ellis, who two weeks 
ago underwent an emergency appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
But what El Capitan did not have on its side was pitcher Rob Ippolito and 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Ippolito struck out four of the last five batters he faced to lead Helix to a 
5-1 victory -- its 16th in the past 18 meetings between the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was doubly important for Helix (13-4, 3-0), which took over sole 
possession of first place over El Capitan (11-5, 2-1). First, the Highlanders 
came back after having their 21-game winning streak over Grossmont Conference 
teams halted by Grossmont, 12-1, Friday. And, perhaps more important, Ippolito 
pitched a strong sixth and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
The book on Ippolito was that he had been tiring after the fifth this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he'd tire after five innings," said Steve Vickery, El Capitan coach. 
"I told the guys that it's a 21-out game, and we just have to hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Schniepp, the Helix coach, was also keeping a close eye on his starter. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd kind of run on empty after the fifth," Schniepp said. "He was tired in 
the sixth and seventh, but he just sucked it up." 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the sixth and runners on first and second thanks to a walk and 
an error, Ippolito struck out the No. 4 and 5 batters to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Ippolito (6-1) struck out the first two batters and got Mike 
Farrell to pop up to the catcher to end the game.

MIRA MESA ERRS LESS THAN MADISON FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For all the wrong reasons, you could tell Wednesday's Mira Mesa-Madison City 
Eastern League game was a big one. Errors were popping up like land mines all 
over the field. 
</P>
<P>
First-place Mira Mesa and second-place Madison combined for eight, plus a 
handful of wild pitches and a couple of passed balls. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the dust had cleared -- and there was a lot of it -- Mira Mesa 
walked away with an 8-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
After the second inning, each team had two errors. The gaffes stopped there for 
Mira Mesa, but host Madison went on to collect four more -- three by shortstop 
Terry Magnett. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally we played our worst game in a long, long time," Mira Mesa Coach Mike 
Prosser said. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been Madison's day, but instead it was kid's day. Mira Mesa's top 
two pitchers, Travis Arnold and Eric Martinez, spent the afternoon watching the 
game from the bleachers. Arnold (6-1) has the chicken pox; Martinez (3-1) is 
academically ineligible and not expected back for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
So Prosser went with sophomore Marc Nielson. And after Nielson, a right-hander 
who had a pinched nerve in his left shoulder, allowed three runs in the second 
inning, Prosser went with sophomore Mike Bovee, who made his first pitching 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 2-0, Madison scored three runs off Nielson in the bottom of the 
second with three walks, Pete Valdez's triple, Lamont Allen's bunt single and 
Albert Mendiola's ground ball, which bounced off second baseman Rickey Hastey's 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
Hastey, batting more than .400 this season, redeemed himself with four runs 
batted in on a three-for-four day at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa (15-2, 7-0) tied it in the fourth when Josh Green, two weeks removed 
from the junior varsity, scored on an error by right fielder Mike Jones. The 
Marauders went ahead, 4-3, in the fifth when Beau Champoux was hit by a pitch 
and scored on Magnett's second error. 
</P>
<P>
Madison is 13-5, 4-2. SCOTT MILLER

Adolph Coors Co.: The brewing company announced a first-quarter net loss of 
$4.8 million, contrasted with net income of $3.7 million a year ago. Revenue, 
however, rose 12.9% to $324 million. Golden, Colo.-based Coors blamed the 
earnings decline on lower beer shipments and higher manufacturing costs.

JACK SMITH: CONTRACTORS NEVER WORK SO QUICKLY FOR US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 25th Pasadena Showcase of Design is supposed to open to the public Sunday, 
but if it does it will be a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The house this year is a large Mediterranean villa overlooking the Flintridge 
La Canada foothills. When I visited the site a week ago so many tradesmen were 
there I had to park a block and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
Landscapers swarmed over the five-acre estate, finishing pools and gardens. The 
new concrete court in front of the entrance was still wet. A plywood staircase 
was being built to handle the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, not a room was finished. Tile men were still at work in the kitchen. 
There were no seats on the dining room chairs. The grand music room with its 
20-foot vaulted ceiling was bare of furniture. Artists were still painting 
flowers on bedroom walls. A toilet sat in an upstairs hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The 9,000-square-foot house was designed by architect Henry Carlton Newton and 
built in 1924 for Harry G. Johansing Sr. and his wife, the former Mary Emily 
Farfsing, at a cost of $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Johansing was an insurance agent and sportsman. He and his wife had come here 
from Cincinnati. They had four girls and three boys, who evidently had an 
idyllic childhood. The boys lived in one upstairs wing and the girls in the 
other, with their parents' master bedroom in between. The children used 
pull-down beds. 
</P>
<P>
The yard was their jungle. The boys had one enormous tree house and the girls 
another, with a drawbridge to keep the boys out. In the spring, when there was 
water in the creek, the boys followed it down to Devile's Gate Dam and launched 
home-made rafts, much to the dismay of their mother. 
</P>
<P>
For the Showcase, a new formal Roman-style swimming pool had been built. The 
tennis court had been put in by the Johansings. They didn't have a pool, I was 
told, because their father had given the children a choice -- pool or tennis 
court, and they had chosen the court because they could use it for other 
activities. But as teen-agers and young adults they danced on a pavilion 
lighted by Chinese lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
A grand piano was yet to be placed in an alcove off the music room. It had once 
held a pipe organ that Johansing played for nightly musicals. His wife sang. 
The music room had also held a grand piano, a harp and a xylophone. Sometimes 
members of the Civic Light Opera came to sing, and a church choir used the room 
for practice while their church was being built. That's how the rich 
entertained themselves before television. 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the nursery, in which the children were kept, successively, as 
infants, were being decorated with hand-painted bluebells, delphiniums and 
Queen Anne's lace; fairies at the top of the bedposts held a lacy canopy over 
the crib. 
</P>
<P>
I had received a letter from a landscaper, Leo Snider, saying he had installed 
an English trysting garden, and finding no suitable poem with "tryst" in it, he 
had written one himself and attributed it to William Wordsworth: 
</P>
<P>
 Speak soft but quick where we will tryst 
</P>
<P>
 Where arms were held and lips were kissed 
</P>
<P>
 By waters old, 'ere much he missed! 
</P>
<P>
 "My question," he said, "is whether it is illegal to so attribute a saying to 
another, and if so, is it so if the person is dead or only so if it is really 
awful poetry?" 
</P>
<P>
I found Snider at work in his garden. Beds of marigolds and white and purple 
petunias surrounded a small pool under a live oak. A nice place to tryst. I 
told him I didn't think Wordsworth would sue, though he might turn over in his 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
The Showcase will be open to the public Sunday through May 21; 10 a.m to 4 p.m. 
Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. 
(Mornings are full.) Free parking and shuttle service from the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry about its not being finished. The Pasadena Junior Philharmonic 
Committee and their hordes of landscapers and interior decorators somehow 
always manage to bring off this miracle. 
</P>
<P>
As for a poem with tryst in it, how about this: 
</P>
<P>
 By the petunias we will tryst 
</P>
<P>
 Under the live oak in the mist 
</P>
<P>
 I'm attributing it to William Shakespeare.

MAGAZINES: 12-YEAR-OLD AUDUBON ARTICLE WARNED OF DANGERS OF VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While magazines around the country scrambled to get a grip on the Exxon oil 
spill in Alaska last month, editors at Audubon magazine quietly thumbed through 
back issues of their conservation journal. 
</P>
<P>
The article they sought is titled "The Valdez Connection," and they've since 
mailed it to 250 newspaper editorial page writers around the country, with a 
note pointing out that the piece is extremely timely -- even though it was 
published 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as this latest tanker wreck occurred, Audubon sent a team of reporters 
and photographers to the scene, editor Les Line said. Their work will appear in 
a "long perspective" piece in the September issue, focusing on the political 
impact of the spill on the proposed development of the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, and the long-term effect on marine ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Line is hoping people will take a look back a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
Written by science reporter Philip Fradkin, the March, 1977, piece summarizes 
the doubts of some public officials and environmentalists about the wisdom of 
shipping oil through that fragile ecology, and the author's speculations on why 
those doubts were largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
It discusses, for example, why double hulls and other safety measures were not 
mandated by international law, and raises concerns about the threat to tankers 
presented by the extreme weather and natural hazards in the Valdez area. 
Stating that more than 50% of ship collisions and groundings are due to human 
error, the article details alleged inadequacies in regulations governing the 
people who pilot those ships. 
</P>
<P>
In attending public meetings on the then-proposed port, the author observed 
that Coast Guard officers and oil tanker captains are among "the most 
self-assured professional groups . . . (with a) commonality of style, which can 
form the strongest of bonds." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, however: "Against these bonds and the combined expertise of the two 
groups it has been impossible for other federal agencies, coastal states and 
environmental groups to assert themselves with any effect in the highly 
technical field of oil tanker safety." Twelve years ago, the author wrote that 
the shipment of oil through Alaskan waters would be a dangerous experiment. 
"The tremendously rich waters of southern Alaska . . . are a poor place to 
experiment on such a large scale," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to be in a position where we are saying we told them this is going to 
happen," Line said this week. "But we did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Faced Cover Story 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who hasn't guzzled too many of this month's selected vintages will 
quickly discern that the current issue of the Wine Spectator is literally 
two-faced. Two covers; two sets of editorial copy. 
</P>
<P>
One contents page lists the standard oenophile stuff: features on California 
cabernets and the scarcity of Dom Perignon. 
</P>
<P>
Flip the semimonthly magazine over, though, and you're staring at the cover of 
the "First Annual Swimsuit Issue." Inside you'll learn that "the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran has decreed that a noted cookbook author and chef 
must have his tongue cut out for writing a guide to matching Middle Eastern 
food with wine," and you'll find a satirical look at Sen. John Tower's alleged 
wine imbibing habits: "Tower's Guide to Power Drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled. The mock issue is merely those wacky wine folks' way of 
playing a belated April Fool's prank on their epicurean readers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gordon, managing editor of the twice-a-month Spectator, said the spoof has 
received enormous response, about two to one in favor of the gag. Those who 
didn't toast the effort were mainly women in the industry, who failed to see 
the humor in the swimsuit parody. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the seven-page satire is deliciously dry and delicate, with hints 
of spice on the finish -- as in alleged wine writer Dan Limberger's piece 
describing a scene in which Mondavi vineyard crews unload imported grape 
plants, "speaking only French to soothe the extraordinarily sensitive French 
vines." 
</P>
<P>
Other efforts, however, are rather astringent, with the sort of bouquet that 
makes one wish the editors had put a cork in it. 
</P>
<P>
In light of recent events, for instance, one can only grimace at the cover 
teaser -- "Geraldo Rivera: Favorite Wines of Serial Killers." Grimace and hope 
it doesn't give the talk show host ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Named Top Editor 
</P>
<P>
Writing in Pravda recently, Communist Party conservatives called him "scum on 
the crest of the wave of renewal." 
</P>
<P>
World Press Review took a different view, and in its May issue the magazine 
names Vitaly Korotich "1988 International Editor of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
WPR selected the editor of Moscow's weekly Ogonyok (Little Flame) "for his 
leadership in a new age of journalism in the Soviet Union; for his devotion to 
reform and democratization despite efforts by conservatives to minimize his 
influence, and for his work to correct 'official' -- but false -- history and 
promote the rehabilitation of victims of Stalinist repression." 
</P>
<P>
When he assumed the editorship of Ogonyok, the "glossy, Life-like" publication 
was similar to other Soviet propaganda organs. "It did not respect people," 
Korotich told WPR. "What appeared in Ogonyok was so removed from people's lives 
that they did not read it." 
</P>
<P>
The first key to the magazine's transformation, he said, was a simple 
commitment "to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Then he persuaded some hot Soviet writers to contribute, among them physicist 
Andrei Sakharov and poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko. 
</P>
<P>
What really caught the eye of the WPR editors, however, was the magazine's 
reporting on Afghanistan, by a young reporter who gave firsthand accounts of 
life in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
"We published some of the first articles to say directly that we should get out 
of there," Korotich said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiction Running Strong 
</P>
<P>
Fiction, long thought to be on the verge of extinction in non-literary 
magazines, continues to make a strong comeback. The April Mother Jones excerpts 
Alice Walker's new novel, "The Temple of My Familiar," and the May issue of 
Self features a new short story by Jay McInerney of "Bright Lights, Big City" 
and "Story of My Life" fame. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Baby You're the Greatest," the story represents a radical departure 
from McInerney's previous work. Written from a traditional point of view, the 
narrative takes a downright mature (moralistic?) approach to the McInerney 
staples of sex and drugs and rock and roll. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the literary front, in an apparent attempt to cross over from one 
brat pack to another, actor Sean Penn can be found waxing poetic on the pages 
of The Moment, "A Randomly Published L.A. Journal of the Arts" (22704 Ventura 
Blvd. 245, Woodland Hills, Calif. 91364). 
</P>
<P>
Penn, who finds himself in the company of such local literary stars as Charles 
Bukowski and Laurel Ann Bogen, shares his thoughts on older women, big dogs 
that wear animal sweaters, and an embarrassing moment in dating. That one 
begins: 
</P>
<P>
 i'm a cartoon, man 
</P>
<P>
 i'm a cartoon for a lot of reasons 
</P>
<P>
 i'm in living color, man 
</P>
<P>
 dots and shades . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'California Design' 
</P>
<P>
The May Architectural Digest is the fattest issue of that monthly ever, 
apparently because advertisers were attracted to the special theme, "California 
Design." 
</P>
<P>
Brendan Gill ponders the nature of California style in the issue -- from 
Spanish colonials to Frank O. Gehry, Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Neutra 
homes -- but seems to conclude only that the state can't be categorized. 
</P>
<P>
Among the homes profiled are Steven Spielberg and Amy Irving's Pacific 
Palisades spread and Robert Mondavi's Napa Valley estate. The most eye-catching 
place featured, however, is artist Tony Duquette's San Francisco residence and 
sculpture pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
With its weird sculptures and gilded pillars, towers, stupas and odd sweeping 
spaces, Duquette's "celebrational environment," would cause most interior 
decorators' brains to hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
But it's easy to believe Duquette when he writes in the accompanying text, 
"within these walls the world which often looks ugly and sad, becomes a 
beautiful, magical place. . . . I look forward to seeing the smile on the face 
of the observer as he feels the excitement of looking into another world." 
</P>
<P>
Look hard at the pictures. On Feb. 15, while the Architectural Digest issue was 
going to press, a five-alarm fire destroyed the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cushy' California Life 
</P>
<P>
Another view of California can be found in the April issue of the Atlantic, 
which remains on the news racks through next week. The cover story excerpts the 
diary of George F. Kennan, whom Atlantic editors call "one of the most 
brilliant analysts and makers of foreign policy in American history." 
</P>
<P>
In these diary entries, Kennan writes eloquently of Paris during the Nazi 
occupation, of postwar Switzerland, Siberia and Norway. But none of these 
places seems nearly as foreign to him as Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly interesting to read his condescending comments, which were 
made 20 years before Christopher Lasch wrote "The Culture of Narcissism," and 
30 years before the South Coast Regional Air Quality Management District 
decided to take charge of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Observing California's dangerous dependence on two liquids, gas and water, 
Kennan worries that with the rise of the automobile, "man has acquired a new 
form of legs. . . . What disturbs me most is man's abject dependence on this 
means of transportation and on the complicated processes that make it 
possible," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
The cushy California life, Kennan believes, renders local residents "childlike 
in many respects: fun-loving , quick to laughter and enthusiasm, unanalytical, 
unintellectual, outwardly expansive, preoccupied with physical beauty and 
prowess, given to sudden and unthinking seizures of aggressiveness, driven 
constantly to protect his status in the group by an eager conformism -- yet not 
unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
If Southern Californians are wise, he writes, "surely the rest of us are 
fools."

ART BUCHWALD: FOR OLLIE, IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on information coming out of Ollie North's trial, I have been able to 
piece together a scenario of events from those fateful Irangate days. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, Ollie was assigned to the White House, and the CIA director, 
William Casey, gave him a briefing on his new duties. 
</P>
<P>
"Ollie, your main role is to thwart the will of Congress by any method that you 
can think of, including lying, shredding documents and dealing with unsavory 
characters -- the kind of people no decent Marine officer would permit himself 
to be associated with. Are you up to it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yessir. I'm gung-ho and semper fi. I'll do any dirty job you want me to, 
whether it's selling arms to Montezuma or laundering money in Tripoli." 
</P>
<P>
"There is just one thing I must warn you about. This operation is against the 
law and if it blows up, you will have to be the scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
"No problem, sir. Marines are taught to fall on their swords." 
</P>
<P>
"That may be so," Casey said, "but you must realize that no president will come 
to your rescue other than to call you a hero." 
</P>
<P>
"I understand. When the time comes, you want me to walk the plank with a 
blindfold over my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what you wear over your eyes. It must be agreed that although you 
will be flying all over Iran, visiting your bank in Switzerland and ordering 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff around, you will never -- repeat, never -- divulge 
who else is in on this dirty little operation." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Casey, I would not snitch on my commander in chief, even if they hung me 
by my thumbs from the portico of the White House. Who else shouldn't I involve 
if we're caught?" 
</P>
<P>
"Vice President Bush." 
</P>
<P>
"Why Bush?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because he's going to become the next President of the United States, and by 
that time he will have denied having any knowledge about Irangate, or whatever 
they'll be calling it when the whole thing falls apart." 
</P>
<P>
"Since I'm taking the blame," Ollie said, "can you tell me how I am going to 
become the fall guy?" 
</P>
<P>
"Atty. Gen. Ed Meese will announce that you are the only person in this country 
responsible for selling arms to Iran and diverting the money to the Contras. 
That will be your signal to shred everything in your office. How you save your 
own neck is none of our business, just as long as you keep the entire chain of 
command out of this fiasco -- if it ever becomes one." 
</P>
<P>
"What does the President do while I am falling on my sword?" 
</P>
<P>
"With a perfectly straight face Ed Meese informs him about what is going on, 
and the President expresses shock and anger that anyone working in the White 
House would try to deceive Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the original conversation could have sounded like that. 
</P>
<P>
If it did, then this is the second part of what I believe happened: 
</P>
<P>
While he's twisting in the wind, Ollie is advised to get a lawyer. He ends up 
with super defense counsel Brendan Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"I promised everyone that if I was caught, I'd take gas," Ollie tells Sullivan 
at their first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"No client of mine takes gas. You're going to tell your story, even if it means 
sending the entire White House staff up the river." 
</P>
<P>
"By doing that I would be implicating President Reagan and President Bush and 
many of their minions." 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly. I am not going to let you be a potted plant for the guys upstairs. 
Remember, this opera isn't over until the Marine colonel sings."

A STATE OF INNOCENCE DULY PUNISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His Daughter by Yoram Kaniuk; translated from Hebrew by Seymour Simckes (George 
Braziller: $17.50; 293 pages) 
</P>
<P>
How to describe Yoram Kaniuk's dark and complex vision of Israel, other than to 
say that he sees it as a state of innocence that will be justly punished? 
</P>
<P>
Greek tragedy or biblical; Prometheus seeking fire for mankind and being 
chained to his rock and corrosive eagle; Adam and Eve seeking the fruit of 
knowledge and being cast out. For Kaniuk, Israel represents a noble venture and 
a fatal transgression. 
</P>
<P>
Others among Israel's finest novelists have voiced the uneasy conscience of a 
society set up as a rightful happy ending to a 2,000-year story of oppression, 
and wonder whether it has become the beginning of a second oppressive story 
written in Arabic. None, I believe, has treated the subject with the rigor and 
brooding intensity of Kaniuk. 
</P>
<P>
Profundity and rigor, not to mention brooding, are not the automatic equivalent 
of art. There is no question that Kaniuk is an artist; a mixture of poet, 
novelist and unappeased searcher. 
</P>
<P>
In "Confessions of a Good Arab," he made a near-masterpiece. Two mutually 
exclusive worlds achieve a raging, almost thermonuclear fusion in the person of 
a man who is half-Arab, half-Jew, and who fights and celebrates himself. It is 
as if, without abandoning a single twinge of pain, the eagle had become 
Prometheus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Indirect Presence 
</P>
<P>
In "His Daughter," the Arabs are an indirect presence but the theme is the 
same, tunneling deeper. So deep, so knotty, so contorted does it get, in fact, 
that the art all but disappears. The diver has sunk out of reach of his air 
hose; the characters are conscripted in their roles as fighters in Israel's war 
with itself. 
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Joseph Krieger, an old military hero, becomes a political scapegoat 
in a controversy over military brutality. Joseph is honest, decent, and a man 
of legendary courage. He is a hammer, a veteran of the times when Israel 
gloried in its lightning strikes, a cultivated Israeli version of John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
His superiors, maneuvering between military demands and the increasingly 
complex considerations involved in dealing with West Bank resisters and world 
opinion, have found in Joseph both a useful weapon and an embarrassment. They 
would like to protect it but not to the point of sticking their necks out. Too 
proud to answer charges he knows are false -- he is blamed for sacrificing one 
of his own officers in the demolition of an Arab house, and of shooting a 
prisoner -- Joseph resigns. 
</P>
<P>
These things are a shadowy background. They establish Joseph, who swims to keep 
fit, cleans house and cooks for his daughter, as the Israel of the innocent 
armed vision. He will be punished by the things he has done in all purity and 
valor; by his victims, by the complexities and corruptions that a dream 
acquires when it becomes a state. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam, the daughter, serves in the army. She is Joseph's light, his inheritor. 
She treats him with a rancor and contempt that is more than post-adolescent 
rebellion. It is more than the pain of a daughter forced to choose between a 
passionate, unfaithful mother who has left home, and her kind but abstract and 
faintly inhuman father. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child of Vision 
</P>
<P>
Miriam, in fact, is the child of the vision, and forced to deal with the pain 
and contradictions that it has created for the young; for the soldier, for 
example, who finds himself blowing up West Bank village houses. 
</P>
<P>
She is obsessed with the ghost of one young soldier who died protesting the 
army's actions in the occupied territories. His name was Isaac -- we remember 
the son whom Abraham meant to sacrifice -- he served under Joseph and he died 
trying to rescue an Arab woman from a house that Joseph had ordered blown up. 
</P>
<P>
Through Miriam, who is torn apart in the process, the ghost of Isaac will 
become Joseph's scheming nemesis, plotting revenge for his own death and, 
beyond that, for the deaths of the Arabs trampled by the vision. 
</P>
<P>
The book's action centers around Miriam's disappearance. It is a mystery full 
of false trails, concealments and inexplicable panic. As Joseph searches, all 
of modern Israel seems to be accomplice to a conspiracy he can't fathom. 
</P>
<P>
There is Isaac's dissolute brother, a television star who was Miriam's lover, a 
young army captain, Joseph's former wife, and others, all of whom seem to know 
something about the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divergent Paths 
</P>
<P>
There are Joseph's two childhood friends and old comrades-in-arms. One has 
become chief of staff, the other the head of the intelligence service. They 
love him but they are estranged; each in his own way serves an Israel that is 
no longer the country of the idealistic sabra-warrior. Joseph is too pure for 
the generation of power, too blood-stained for the generation of protest. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Miriam and Joseph are destroyed in different and ironic fashions. 
Isaac has his revenge but it brings no peace to his spirit nor any resolution 
to the moral questions that, Kaniuk believes, are ripping his country apart. 
</P>
<P>
To speak of the theme of "His Daughter," unfortunately, is largely to speak of 
the book. It is a murky, allusive discourse whose mysteries are simply 
packages, which, when opened, contain new lumps of discourse. Joseph, through 
all the complex and dimly seen plots that swirl about him, is trying to save 
his soul and his honor, but his effort resembles an autopsy more than a 
resurrection.

ON VIEW: PIONEER AVIATOR FETE AT MUSEUM OF FLYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It's not often that an invitation comes with the option for aviation attire. It 
will be more de rigueur than black-tie (also acceptable) for the Museum of 
Flying's special evening Saturday on the grounds of the Santa Monica Airport. 
The invitations are slick with a photo of a DT Torpedo Bomber, 1923 vintage, 
surrounded by the original Douglas Aircraft employees. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Stewart, the museum's executive director, is putting the dinner and 
dancing together honoring a host of aviation pioneers who have written their 
names across the skies. (Stewart was a mover and shaker in the original 
Pasadena Showcase House of Design, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary 
the same night). 
</P>
<P>
They'll all cocktail amidst Spitfires and P-51 Mustangs. The museum's board of 
governors will lend pizazz -- Donald Douglas Jr., chairman; David G. Price, 
president; and board members including actor/producer Tony Bill; Walter J. 
Boyne, former director of the Smithsonian; William P. Clark; Charles Knapp; 
Lois Hamilton Knapp; Dr. Paul MacCready; John Marin; Bruce W. Orriss; actor 
Cliff Robertson; Edwin M. Stanley and Madine Pulaski. 
</P>
<P>
BIGGER, BETTER: The pride of UCLA was evident the other evening in gargantuan 
proportions as the powers plopped a big white tent over the Royce Hall Quad -- 
site of the campus's original four buildings -- to host 1,000 friends (UCLA has 
180,000 alums in the Southern California area) for a black-tie sit-down dinner 
and then a stage salute from Gregory Peck, Mel Torme and Henry Mancini at 
Royce. 
</P>
<P>
The white chocolate cornucopias filled with spring berries and sabayon sauce 
were planned by John and Marion Anderson, UCLA campaign celebration co-chairs, 
to be symbolic of the university's successful conclusion of its UCLA Campaign 
-- $375 million raised privately over the past six years for academic programs 
campuswide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the proudest and happiest moments in UCLA history," Anderson, 
who went to UCLA on an ice hockey scholarship, told the crowd. "Please raise 
your glasses -- here's to UCLA, here's to the Bruins, here's to the Blue and 
the Gold -- to all of you and to all of us -- to UCLA, our beloved university. 
Let the feast begin." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson truly could say us. He and Marion (wearing Bulgari cabachon rubies and 
diamonds) have given $15 million to UCLA. There were other colossal givers, 
though. And the Andersons shared the stage with UCLA Campaign National Chairman 
James A. Collins and Chancellor Charles Young, both praised profusely for their 
dedication to the drive. They, in turn, praised their wives -- Carol Collins 
and Sue Young -- and the city's prominent. As Raymond L. Orbach, College of 
Letters and Science provost, pointed out, Young was also celebrating his 20th 
year with the university. "He has coaxed, cajoled us to the heights of 
excellence." 
</P>
<P>
Present were at least 17 of the 30 faculty members who are the recipients of 
endowed chairs from the campaign. Among the others, gazing up through the clear 
tent to the turquoise and apricot illumination of Royce and the library, was a 
crowd including prominent donors Eugene and Maxine Rosenfeld, former Ambassador 
to the United Nations Economic and Social Council Lester and Carolbeth Korn, 
Leonard and Dorothy Straus, Richard and Eileen Eamer, Edgardo and Francesca 
Acosta, Roy and Carol Doumani, Robert and Lois Erburu, Dr. Peter and Helen 
Bing, Phillip and Helen Fowler, Gordon and Virginia MacDonald, Henry and Ginny 
Mancini, Edward and Hannah Carter, David and Dallas Price, Yvonne Lenart, 
Stephen and Kitty Moses. 
</P>
<P>
The evening ended romantically with Mancini at the piano and Torme's velvet 
warbles of "The Days of Wine and Roses" and, of course, "Moon River" for a 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: To Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson, who blew out the candle on each birthday 
cake in a cake parade for 256 guests at the Beverly Hills Hotel Crystal 
Ballroom. Not only did His Excellency Han Xu, Ambassador to the U.S. from 
China, attend, but China also sent its first ambassador to the United States, 
Chai Zemin, to present Caroline with the American Marco Polo award for her 
achievements in developing relations between the U.S. and the People's Republic 
of China. The Los Angeles-Guangzhou Sister City Assn. hosted . . .

MOVIE REVIEW;

<P>
A BITTERSWEET 'CHOCOLAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her first film, "Chocolat" (at the Nuart Friday), co-writer/director Claire 
Denis, who has worked closely with Jim Jarmusch and Wim Wenders, treasures the 
elliptical and the allusive. She makes her portrait of 1950s white French 
colonials in black Cameroon out of fragments, snapshots ragged at the edge, 
snippets of observation. 
</P>
<P>
"Chocolat" is a film of some subtlety. It has good, even memorable moments to 
it, and it's beautiful looking. It is very, very, very French, which may or may 
not be your cup of chocolat. It is also a suffocatingly precious film, enough 
to try the patience of an oyster, and one that primly refuses to detonate the 
mounting numbers of erotic situations it sets up. 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely Denis' way; to do otherwise would clearly be a vulgarity in 
her eyes. Yet it may have an opposite effect. By denying her black central 
character, Protee, any outlet for the sexual rage and humiliation building up 
in him, instead of the statement Denis imagines she is making, she actually 
takes away his humanity. He becomes ennobled, pure and beautiful as a living 
statue and as objectified. 
</P>
<P>
The film is one long flashback, a truncated, brooding return to the places of 
her childhood by a reflective adult, France Dalens (Mireille Perrier). Her 
reveries as she speeds across this shimmering landscape move her back roughly 
25 years, to when her youngish father, Marc Dalens (Francois Cluzet) was the 
colonial district officer for the area. (Cluzet is familiar to Americans as 
Dexter Gordon's stalwart French fan in " 'Round Midnight.") 
</P>
<P>
His position provides Dalens and his beautiful, tensed-up wife, Aimee (Giulia 
Boschi), with a big, pleasant house, soldiers under Dalens' command and a house 
staff, including the enormously capable African "boy" Protee (Isaach de 
Bankole), frequently in charge of the house during Dalens' excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Protee and the 7-year-old France (Cecile Ducasse), an observant child, mostly 
silent under her little straw helmet, spend most of their time together in 
mutual invisibility. They are friends, although as Denis, who co-wrote the 
screenplay with Jean-Pol Fargeau, sees France, the child is already an 
imperious little white colonial too. Frankly, it doesn't leave us many people 
to give a tinker's damn about. Marc Dalens, who loves the country and possibly 
even its people and is prescient enough to know that the French will not be 
astride it forever, is the best of the bunch but he's not the world's most 
charismatic leader. 
</P>
<P>
It might help if the film makers let us in on the Dalenses' relationship. 
Mostly, lonely, bored mamman smokes, drinks endless cups of espresso and 
alternately yearns for and is imperious toward Protee. (Boschi was Christopher 
Lambert's bride in "The Sicilian," and the jury is still out on whether her 
attitudes constitute acting but she certainly is decorative.) 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the way into the film, the emergency landing of a small plane 
brings its passengers to the Dalens household, while mechanical parts are sent 
for and a runway is built. They are, in varying degrees, a loathsome bunch, 
arrogant and condescending, with an ingrained, unearned sense of superiority. 
The foulmouthed, bullying coffee planter, Delpich (Jacques Denis), seems the 
worst of the lot. Then, in the film's best scene, as Delpich lounges under a 
canvas with a few of the men after their noontime meal, he unexpectedly sings a 
refrain from a childhood song. Coming from such a despicable soul, his voice is 
unexpectedly sweet and poignant; it's a surprising, humanizing moment. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the most dangerous guest is Luc Segalen (Jean-Claude Adelin), a 
muscular ex-seminarian currently walking across the continent, who prides 
himself on truth-telling and a "simple" way of life more native than that of 
the natives. More precisely, he's a sexual predator who has already cut a 
considerable swath among the French ladies at one after another remote outpost. 
Anyone with a good memory for the '70s will recognize Segalen; he's a variation 
on the earnest young Americans who became more Indian than the Navajos; more 
peaceable than Gandhi. Today they are commodities traders and movie producers. 
</P>
<P>
"Chocolat" is a compendium of telling moments, so self-consciously pointed that 
they form a connect-the-dots map of colonialism. What makes it a bore is that 
audiences are encouraged to think that by picking up these vast, looming clues, 
they are on to something deep. 
</P>
<P>
Jarmusch works in fragments, too, but they finally lead to something, and his 
films have a buoyancy that comes from his bushwhacking humor. Denis is 
cautious, joyless, as though she regarded levity from her film's few possible 
comic moments or characters (Segalen is one) as inappropriate to the toniness 
of her message. So the film's natural light moments are stifled. 
</P>
<P>
"Chocolat" broods, it teases with consummate adroitness, then it skitters away 
from confrontation. (The film is MPAA rated PG-13 for brief nudity.) It has no 
driving rhythm to it, only nicely captured moments in isolation. In a slightly 
different context, Denis has called her film "suffused with a sense of 
frustration." Audiences may agree with her completely.

BALLET REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
'BILLY THE KID,' JOFFREY STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," "Rodeo" and "Appalachian Spring" -- those enduring American 
dance milestones with classic Aaron Copland scores -- there are moments when 
the troubled central characters gaze across the frontier and all their 
yearnings, feelings of isolation, even their futures are reflected back in 
music of profound tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
This moment of expectancy and resignation is gloriously realized by Glenn 
Edgerton in the problematic new staging of "Billy the Kid" by the Joffrey 
Ballet, a staging introduced to local audiences Tuesday on a mixed bill at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton has always been a notably thoughtful, imaginative dancer. And though 
his portrayal of Billy is otherwise multilayered and sharply defined, there are 
times when he wisely does nothing more than let the music flow over him, 
allowing Copland to express what Billy cannot. 
</P>
<P>
In this ballet, music is landscape, character, destiny -- so the dancer who can 
absorb it, make it his subtext, becomes the mythic outlaw in a way that can't 
be explained by acting alone. Edgerton understands: He is eloquent just 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," Eugene Loring told deeper truths than Agnes de Mille in 
"Rodeo" and aimed for a wider scope than Martha Graham in "Appalachian Spring," 
but, 50 years after its creation, his choreography seems most remarkable for 
its daring stylization -- its way of enlarging documentary details of behavior 
into bold social statements. 
</P>
<P>
Against Jared French's formal frieze of cacti, the ballet often looks like a 
'30s poster or mural come to life -- though, unfortunately, Patrice L. 
Whiteside's Joffrey production is often stronger on specifics of movement 
design than on dramatic thrust. We see Loring's innovations in stance and 
vocabulary lovingly reproduced, but somehow they seem disconnected from a 
dynamic concept. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the familiar American Ballet Theatre production, for example, the 
celebrated winning-of-the-West procession that opens and closes the ballet 
looked curiously static on Tuesday: full of the meticulously etched gesture and 
mime that ABT usually smudges, but utterly lacking in forward momentum. It's as 
if Manifest Destiny had bogged down somewhere east of Topeka. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was always the sensitivity and sardonic power of Edgerton -- 
though, ironically, he was not originally announced to dance the Tuesday 
performance (due to a scheduling error). 
</P>
<P>
As Alias, a composite of Billy's victims, Peter Narbutas deftly created a 
gallery of intriguing character sketches and, in the dual role of Billy's 
doomed mother and dream-sweetheart, Jodie Gates neatly balanced down-to-earth 
authority against otherworldly lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Douglas Martin seemed pretty vacant as Pat Garrett (is that final salute 
to the former friend he has just murdered sincere, ironic or merely staged by 
Whiteside?). John Miner conducted with an emphasis on lush sonorities, but also 
with some odd tempos. 
</P>
<P>
The program (opening night of a seven-performance engagement in Segerstrom 
Hall) also included two company staples choreographed in the late 1970s: Paul 
Taylor's satiric "Cloven Kingdom" (originally created for Taylor's modern-dance 
ensemble) and Gerald Arpino's showpiece "Suite Saint-Saens." 
</P>
<P>
Using courtly music by Corelli interrupted by bursts of antic percussion 
composed by Henry Cowell and Malloy Miller, "Cloven Kingdom" contrasts elegant 
social pretense with galvanic, animalistic impulse. 
</P>
<P>
We're in a ballroom, we're in a disco, we're in the zoo. But we also may be on 
Parnassus as well, for who are those four women in their geometric, mirrored 
headdresses except Muses inspiring new and strange permutations in the group 
rituals? A very quirky work, full of defiantly idiosyncratic movement. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "Suite Saint-Saens" is a very slick collage of bravura classical 
step-combinations, sequenced for a kind of random, impersonal dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen dancers constantly zoom through dappled light, punch out a virtuoso 
stunt and then leave as others arrive. You never have to worry about what it 
means and it only begins to bother you if you really like these dancers -- if 
you enjoy watching Leslie Carothers or Carole Valleskey or Edward Stierle and 
wish that Arpino was using them as artists rather than exclamation points. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, for the record, the Joffrey danced "Suite Saint-Saens" splendidly on 
Tuesday. Indeed, this may be the best company in the world at dignifying 
neoclassical kitsch. But, then, it's had more practice.

 Laughs, romance and thrills among the downtown homeless: a sexy newspaper 
reporter (Linda Blair) joins forces with a wino ex-comedy writer and an amiable 
shopping-cart fatso to track down a trash-heap slasher. Meanwhile, lecherous 
L.A. newspaper editors seduce their staff in Jacuzzis. Once in a while, some 
humor, life and verve seep though in the otherwise coy street scenes, but 
star-producer-writer Murray Langston and writer-director Bob Logan do prove you 
can craft a reasonable equivalent for the usual studio-made $15-million fiasco 
for only $150,000 -- an achievement in itself. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

Spanish tenor Jose Carreras was greeted by cheers and applause on his return to 
London's Royal Opera House on Tuesday after a three-year absence caused by his 
fight against leukemia. Carreras, 42, won at least 10 standing ovations -- the 
first before he even began his two-hour recital -- as a packed house clapped, 
cheered, stamped and showered the stage with flowers. Carreras was diagnosed in 
1987 as suffering from leukemia. ALEENE MacMINN

 No doubt there's decent raw thriller material in the story of a deposed Latin 
American president finding himself on the run from death squads and foreign 
intelligence agents in London. This puffball of a movie squanders that premise, 
though, plying the Central American crisis merely for generic, 
sub-"Hitchcockian" romance and yuks. Writer-director Maurice Hatton strains 
credibility at every turn, having handsome hero-in-exile Andy Garcia run into 
KGB clowns, a sinister CIA operative, a WASPy love interest and any other fatal 
cliche in sight. Avoid.CHRIS WILLMAN

Striking technicians at the Paris Opera house forced the cancellation of a 
production of "Faust" this week, but on Wednesday they agreed to let a planned 
cancer benefit gala starring Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr. go 
ahead on Tuesday. The technicians are protesting plans to transfer staff to a 
new People's Opera at Place de la Bastille, which is still under construction. 
Performances of Tchaikovsky's ballet, "Sleeping Beauty," which is playing on

MORNING REPORT: 'BIG' TAKES TOP SPOT

"Big" is finally making the big splash it was expected to make a few weeks ago. 
After three weeks, the Tom Hanks comedy ascended to No. 1 on the Billboard 
magazine rental chart. "Stealing Home," featuring best-actress Oscar winner 
Jodie Foster, debuted at No. 25, but could wind up in the Top 10 -- thanks to 
the exposure from Foster's Oscar victory. "Hellbound: Hellraiser II," a 
favorite among horror fans -- especially the young ones -- debuted at No. 17. 
Look for this one to be the most popular horror rental of the next few weeks. 
"Mystic Pizza," the comedy/drama about three female friends who work at a pizza 
joint, entered the chart at No. 19 and has definite Top 10 potential. 
</P>
<P>
* An action movie featuring two big stars, Gene Hackman and Danny Glover, "Bat 
21" could be a rental smash. "Lethal Weapon" made Glover a big star in the 
rental market. Also, Hackman is hot now because of his best-actor nomination 
for "Mississippi Burning."

ERIC MARIENTHAL QUINTET ATTACKS SET WITH FERVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Squeezing the music of Eric Marienthal's high energy ensemble into the intimate 
confines of Le Cafe's upstairs jazz room in Sherman Oaks is a bit like trying 
to contain a windstorm in a pup tent. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the saxophonist's first set Monday night managed, for the most 
part, to keep the musical quality as high as the decibel power. Performing 
pieces that were drawn from his newly released GRP album, Marienthal -- perhaps 
best known for his work with Chick Corea's Elektric Band -- sounded like a 
player who is on the verge of discovering his own musical personality. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three tunes into the set, Marienthal moved past the David Sanborn riffs 
that are the starting points of his style and progressed into several 
high-flying solos that were his, and his alone. "Reunion," co-composed with 
bassist John Patitucci, triggered an improvisational tour through the harmonic 
outer limits; on "Lee Ann," written for his wife, Marienthal abruptly shifted 
gears, revealing a warmth and subtlety not always present in his up-tempo 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, a few problems. Marienthal's band -- Patitucci on bass, 
Pat Kelly on guitar, Mitchell Forman on keyboards, John Ferraro on drums -- was 
not, except for Patitucci, present for the recording. They were obliged, as a 
result, to place a bit too much focus on reading charts rather than exploring 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, the band matched Marienthal's fervor, with Patitucci, in 
particular, acting as a virtual musical partner, and Forman contributing 
several vigorously creative solos.DON HECKMAN

GOLIA SEXTET BATTLES AMBIANCE AT AL'S BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We're going to play a ballad now so you can hear the pinball machine," 
announced Vinny Golia midway through his opening set at Al's Bar in downtown 
Los Angeles. That statement summed up the problems facing the local jazz 
saxophonist's sextet during its uneven, hourlong performance. 
</P>
<P>
With the band sandwiched between electronic game noises on one side and pool 
table chatter and clatter on the other Sunday, any delicate musical passages 
faced serious environmental obstacles. And the unforgiving cement walls meant 
that drummer Alex Cline usually (and inadvertently) overwhelmed the band with 
volume whenever he attempted to do more than serve as the ensemble's rhythmic 
anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Golia's compositions featured long, angular themes that usually resolved in 
unexpected and intriguing harmonies from the saxophone-trombone-trumpet front 
line. The pieces were laced with counter-melodies, which occasionally led to 
delightful passages like the funky trombone, drum and piano riff supporting Ken 
Filiano's bowed bass solo on "Not Used." 
</P>
<P>
But Golia miscalculated by focusing too much on playing soprano sax when his 
rich, robust tone on tenor tapped into a deeply spiritual vein which merited 
more extensive exploration. That was only one example of a set where fine 
individual components -- notably the subtle color and textural variations 
introduced by Cline's percussion and Wayne Peet's electric keyboards -- fell 
out of sync as often as they jelled. DON SNOWDEN

BLOOM BURIES PAST, MOVES INTO NEW REALM OF SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Ira Bloom, the soprano saxophonist who came to town this week for a 
three-day spell at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood (she closes tonight), 
has moved beyond the tentative modernisms of her earliest recordings, more than 
a decade ago, into an adventurous realm of spirited sounds on the brink of the 
avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, one of the most experimental works in her first show Tuesday was 
a movement from the suite of compositions she was commissioned to write for 
NASA after watching the Discovery launch. Here and elsewhere she made extensive 
use of the electronic effects that have piqued her imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic music on wind instruments is no novelty. Many of the ideas employed 
by Bloom, such as the octave divider, were popularized by Paul Horn on 
saxophone and flute more than 20 years ago. But Bloom's wild slashes of sound 
-- at one point in "Miro" she used a series of whole-tone-scale chords -- 
seemed logical, and were well matched by her dance-like body movements. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a piano (included on most of her recent recordings) was a 
detriment. Her original works such as "Ice Dancing" and "Drums Like Dancing" 
were hampered by a backing of just bass (Kent McLagan) and drums (Tom Rainey). 
Both were efficient, but often -- most notably in a chord-oriented song such as 
"Over the Rainbow" -- the keyboard was conspicuous by its absence. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom's sound, when not subjected to the amplified effects, is clean and 
convincing, her phrasing impeccable. If she doesn't always succeed in her 
attempts to break into new ground, at least she must be credited for trying to 
cross some potentially hazardous borders. LEONARD FEATHER

'TATTINGER'S' MISSES AND HITS IN NEW INCARNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Tattinger's" is back and only half as bad. That's because it's only half as 
long. 
</P>
<P>
But that is only the initial impression of NBC's "Nick &amp; Hillary," the 
half-hour comedy version of the hourlong dramatic series "Tattinger's," which 
underwent a drastic conversion after bombing in the ratings earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
With a mere four-episode commitment and no regular time slot, "Nick &amp; 
Hillary" is hanging by a thread. It premieres at 9:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36 
and 39, and returns Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., but thereafter faces a blurry 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, for although tonight's premiere gets bogged down in establishing 
characters and a series environment, Wednesday's episode is a wheezingly funny, 
fast-cutting, smashingly executed farce. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Collins and Blythe Danner return as the divorced Nick and Hillary 
Tattinger, still bickering, but now partners with former maitre d' Sid Wilbur 
(Jerry Stiller) in once-staid Tattinger's restaurant, which has been converted 
into a trendy disco eatery by its radical-chic new manager, Spin (Chris 
Elliott). 
</P>
<P>
The transformation was approved by the flighty Hillary while Nick was out of 
the country, and he hates it. But it stays, and so do Spin and his silent, 
inanimate sidekick Marti (Anna Levine). 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Nick and Hillary mainly spin their wheels over Spin. Forget it. This 
is the Boston tryout, good for working out the kinks. Come back for Wednesday's 
hilarious Broadway opening -- which feels like a blend of "Cheers" and early 
"Moonlighting" -- and you'll be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Channing Gibson and directed by Don Scardino, Episode 2 is about 
celery increases and salary increases. Spin relays Marti's demand for a raise. 
When she doesn't get it, Marti -- who sits in front of the reservation book but 
does nothing and says nothing -- goes on strike by doing nothing and saying 
nothing more intensely. She's merciless. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Spin is a mess and Tattinger's falls apart, making its trendy 
crowd unhappy. It gets so bad one evening that Paul Shaffer leaves early! 
</P>
<P>
Collins and Danner are wonderful together, Stiller is funny and Elliott and 
Levine are to die for. Episode 2, at least, is daringly inventive comedy that 
deserves a place in prime time. As they say in the restaurant business: Break a 
leg . . . of mutton. HOWARD ROSENBERG

STAGE WATCH: 'EXPRESS' HEADS FOR SAN DIEGO, LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Starlight Express" will chug into the Southland at the 
end of the year, opening at the San Diego Civic Theatre Dec. 26 and playing the 
Pantages Theatre in Hollywood for six weeks, beginning in February. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong San Diego engagement will open the national tour for the musical, 
a high-tech extravaganza featuring roller skaters who portray trains. In 
between San Diego and Hollywood, the show will stop in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The tour will cost approximately $4.5 million to mount, in comparison with the 
$8-million price tag reported for the New York production. Stan Seiden, West 
Coast president of Nederlander Inc., which owns the national touring rights, 
said the touring production "has been simplified but not cut down." For 
example, he said the train tracks will extend over the orchestra but not up to 
the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
"Starlight Express" will be offered as the star attraction of the next Los 
Angeles Civic Light Opera subscription season, said Seiden. The other shows 
have not been selected. 
</P>
<P>
Seiden, who doubles as president of the LACLO, defended the decision to close 
the current season with Barbara Rush in "Steel Magnolias," a non-musical that 
played in Pasadena last fall, as the replacement for Cole Porter's "Anything 
Goes." "Steel Magnolias" will be the LACLO's second non-musical offering in a 
row, following the ongoing "Driving Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any musicals around," said Seiden. "You just can't afford to 
produce them like they used to." He added that most of those musicals which do 
get produced can't sustain a six-week run in Los Angeles, which is necessary to 
accommodate all of the LACLO's subscribers. He declined to say how large that 
subscription audience is. 
</P>
<P>
Mailings about "Magnolias" went out to subscribers last week, he said, and only 
one complaint has been received -- from a subscriber who had seen the play in 
Pasadena. He offered that subscriber a choice of a refund or two extra tickets 
to one of next year's attractions, and he said he would do the same for any 
subscriber who saw the Pasadena production and who complains about the 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of enough musicals, why not change the name of Los Angeles Civic 
Light Opera? "It has been talked about," said Seiden. "We've considered 
augmenting the name." 
</P>
<P>
Augmenting? How about shortening it -- and removing that musty musical 
connotation with one stroke? 
</P>
<P>
We humbly suggest: "Los Angeles Civic Lite." 
</P>
<P>
FACE THE MUSIC: Musicals continue to be produced, despite Seiden's comments. 
Some of the latest evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Harlem Suite," a new dance musical conceived, choreographed and directed 
by Maurice Hines, starring Melba Moore as well as Hines, will open May 11 at 
the Pantages (which is owned and operated by the Nederlander company) for an 
open-ended run. This will be a revised version of a show that played in five 
Eastern and Southern cities last fall and winter. Moore has replaced Stephanie 
Mills, who replaced Jennifer Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Preceding "Harlem Suite" at the Pantages is "Don't Get God Started," a 
revival of the gospel musical by Ron Milner (book) and Marvin Winans (music), 
who stars with his wife, Vicki Winans. It opens Wednesday and plays through May 
7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Long Beach Civic Light Opera has announced its 1989-90 season: 
"Sophisticated Ladies" (Oct. 5-22), "Follies" (March 1-18, using the original 
script as opposed to the revised version recently seen in London), "Jesus 
Christ, Superstar" (May 3-20) and "1776" (July 12-29, 1990). LBCLO may later 
add a new musical version of "Our Town," which is expected to feature Mary 
Martin as the Stage Manager; Long Beach was one of the five original investors 
in it. 
</P>

 -- The California Music Theatre continues its revivals at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium -- including "Kiss Me, Kate," opening Saturday. George Hearn has 
bowed out of the role of Pseudolus in the CMT's upcoming "A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum" (June 14-July 2). He has been replaced by 
E.E. Bell. The "Forum" cast also will feature Jack Carter, Lu Leonard, Barney 
Martin and Michael Tucci. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As announced Wednesday, the Music Center will present two musicals in 
two-week runs this summer: "Gypsy" with Tyne Daly and "Fiddler on the Roof" 
with Topol. "We feel dedicated to the genre," said Music Center Operating 
Company president Sandra Kimberling, "because it's obviously what people want 
to see." She hopes more time will open up for musicals in the existing Music 
Center halls after the new Disney Hall opens in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
On the debit side, Angelenos shouldn't expect to see LACLO's canceled "Anything 
Goes" any time soon. The touring company closed prematurely. "The physical 
production was too heavy to travel and make all those one-week dates on time," 
said a spokesman for the show. A leaner "Anything Goes" may be revived in time 
to make its scheduled Sept. 19 opening at Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
but Los Angeles won't see it until 1990 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: The Theatre League Alliance (Theatre LA) will present its newly created 
Governors Awards to 15 recipients "who have contributed significantly to the 
excellence of live theater in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The honorees: composer-lyricist Billy Barnes, producer-actress Marla Gibbs, 
LACLO founder Edwin Lester, East West Players founder Mako, writer-director 
Luis Valdez, Music Center creator Dorothy Chandler, critic Dick Lochte, Los 
Angeles Endowment for the Arts architect (and Los Angeles City Councilman) Joel 
Wachs, and actors Charlton Heston, Jack Lemmon, Lu Leonard and Mary Martin. 
Awards will be presented in memoriam to actor-director John Allison, Pasadena 
Playhouse founder Gilmor Brown and actor Henry Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, designed by artist Robert Graham, will be presented at a Nov. 20 
ceremony at the Pasadena Playhouse. The event is intended to become an annual 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
THE CALLBOARD Theatre will be busy in the next three months. First up is 
Project III doing Bertolt Brecht's "Baal," opening May 12 for three weeks. Then 
the newly formed Strike Theatre will present three plays in repertory: Don 
DeLillo's "The Day Room," the Jacobean thriller "The Revengers," and the 
premiere of Harry Kondoleon's "The Fairy Garden." 
</P>
<P>
A MEMORIAL for actor Merritt Butrick, who played the hustler in "Kingfish" at 
Los Angeles Theatre Center last year, will be held Monday at 8 p.m. in the LATC 
lobby. Butrick died last month of undisclosed causes. Contributions may be made 
in his memory to the Actors Fund of America.

LONG BEACH COUNCIL APPROVES $1-BILLION PROJECT AT OLD PIKE SITE 
</P>

<P>
An ambitious plan to build a mini-city on the old Pike Amusement Park site 
picked up another important approval this week with the ease of a 
roller-coaster car sliding downhill. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council noted concerns about traffic congestion associated with the 
$1-billion development, expressed confidence that gridlock could be avoided and 
unanimously approved local coastal plan changes so the huge project can move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acted with enthusiasm, heaping praise on a development that is 
bigger and denser than anything ever built in this city of historically 
suburban sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Their comments were glowing as they approved changes that would more the double 
the site's maximum density and allow buildings up to 600 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a golden opportunity for this city," Councilwoman Jan C. Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ol' days are about to come back," Councilman Les Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted," Councilman Clarence Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie E. Kell said the project is exciting; Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude called the development a big boost for downtown, and Councilman Jeffrey 
A. Kellogg repeated several times that he is very proud to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-building project of offices, residences, hotels and shops -- one of the 
largest urban coastal developments in the country -- still has several hurdles 
to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Plans must be approved by the California Coastal Commission. Then the city must 
approve a master site plan that spells out details of the development, which is 
be to built over 13 years, beginning in 1990, on acreage near the Hyatt Regency 
hotel and the Long Beach Convention Center, bounded by Shoreline Drive, Seaside 
Way, Pine Avenue and Queens Way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13-Acre Development 
</P>
<P>
While mentioning the possibility of traffic jams associated with the 13-acre 
development, the council seemed assured that city planners and developers would 
devise ways to handle the cars traveling to and from the seaside complex, which 
is expected to employ 8,000 people and generate 27,500 to 36,000 car trips a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ratkovich -- whose Los Angeles company is developing the site in 
conjunction with a West Coast subsidiary of a company owned by developer James 
W. Rouse, who is known nationally for his shoreline developments -- said the 
project's traffic studies indicate that of 12 surrounding intersections, two 
would be pushed to unacceptable levels of congestion by the project. 
</P>
<P>
And those two, Alamitos Avenue and Ocean Boulevard and Alamitos and 7th Street, 
are already backed up at peak commuting hours, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich also emphasized that the nature of the mixed-use project would cut 
down on car use, because people could walk from hotels and residences to shops 
and offices. 
</P>
<P>
"For Southern California, it is bold and unprecedented," Ratkovich said. "But 
it is a necessary step away from dependency on the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Robert Paternoster pointed out that the developers would 
be required to make traffic improvements, including installing traffic signals, 
upgrading intersections, extending some streets on the site, installing bus 
shelters and drawing up plans to encourage car-pooling and use of mass transit 
by office workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Firm Hired 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers have agreed to whatever transportation-related development 
fees are imposed by the city when the transportation section of the General 
Plan is finished. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Paternoster said, city planners have hired a private 
consulting firm to design a computer model that will allow the city to simulate 
traffic problems associated with Pike and 11 other downtown developments that 
are under way or have been approved. The model will be used to find ways of 
routing the traffic to avoid traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for several organizations that had previously complained to the 
Planning Commission about future traffic nightmares downtown repeated their 
concerns to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the Pike project, city officials should have a much better 
idea of how they are going to handle the thousands of extra cars that the 
complex will draw, argued Marc Coleman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Support Density 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to forecast there may be a solution in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lamond of the Long Beach branch of the Sierra Club also said that while 
the project is in many ways admirable, his group cannot support the increased 
height and density limits, which would spawn a development that would 
contribute to air pollution and traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Others criticized the project for not including housing for low- or 
moderate-income residents. In response, the developers said they want to design 
the 1,000 planned residences for a range of incomes. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that, of the $13 million a year the fully completed project is 
expected to generate in sales-tax revenue to the city, $1.8 million a year will 
be set aside for low-cost housing.

NEIGHBORS SUE TO BLOCK PLAN FOR MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angry neighbors of the Lanterman House in La Canada Flintridge have filed a 
lawsuit against the city, opposing the use of the 1915 Craftsman-style mansion 
as a museum and requesting that the city start over with its plans. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which the neighbors' attorney plans to serve on the city this 
week, claims that the 1988 environmental impact report for use of the house as 
a museum is legally inadequate and that the conditional-use permit issued on 
the basis of that report is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking the position that the environmental impact report is deficient 
and the process needs to be done over," said Dhiya El-Saden, one of the 
neighbors. "We don't think the City Council adequately considered various 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment From City 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Stephanie R. Scher said she could not comment on the lawsuit, 
which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, until the city had been served. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not terribly surprised, but I am disappointed," Scher said. "I thought the 
city had worked very hard to try to work this out and mitigate any problems." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also contends that use of the Lanterman House on Encinas Drive is 
inconsistent with the city's general plan and zoning codes. 
</P>
<P>
"Critical to the challenges is whether this is consistent with the city's 
policy of single-family residences," said William Ross, the neighbors' 
attorney. "Is it appropriate to put an institutional use of this intensity in a 
residential neighborhood?" 
</P>
<P>
The nine plaintiffs are asking that the permit be nullified and that the city 
redo the planning process, including considering other alternatives for the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Guy, who lives across the street from the house, said neighbors want to 
see the property sold as a single-family residence and opened to the public 
once or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a R-1 neighborhood, which means private homes," Guy said. "And that's 
what we want -- private homes. You just don't put a business in a residential 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
It has also been suggested that the historic contents of the house be moved to 
nearby Descanso Gardens and that the money from the sale of the house be used 
as a down payment for a new city hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Effort 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is the latest effort by frustrated homeowners near the house who 
have vehemently opposed its conversion to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the house has been the subject of emotional public debate since the 
death of Lloyd Lanterman in 1987. Lanterman, the last survivor of the family 
that founded La Canada Flintridge, bequeathed his home to the city several 
years ago with the understanding that the property be preserved for community 
and civic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
When the city announced its plans to convert the historic house into a museum 
and cultural center, angry neighbors voiced their concerns about parking 
problems and increased traffic and noise in the neighborhood at a public 
hearing in February. 
</P>
<P>
They also charged that the City Council had not sufficiently examined 
alternatives to the museum proposal, saying that council members came to the 
debate with their own ideas about what to do with the property, and that the 
environmental impact report and conditional-use permit were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the homeowners' objections, the council voted 4-to-1 to deny the 
appeal and approve the report and conditional-use permit.

'APATHETIC ATTITUDE'; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE RAPS CONTRACTOR FOR GARAGE DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale city officials are blaming delays in the construction of a downtown 
parking garage on the contractor's "general apathetic attitude" and are 
threatening fines and legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The 741-space parking garage on Maryland Avenue between Broadway and Wilson 
Avenue was supposed to be an impetus to the renovation of deteriorated 
buildings in a two-block area between Brand Boulevard and Louise Street. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the eight-floor garage, which was to open last September in time for 
the Christmas shopping season, is now delayed at least until the end of July, 
city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city has had to put off a $1.3-million street improvement 
project because the contractor's heavy equipment is in the way. Construction of 
a new three-story arcade linking the garage with shops on Brand Boulevard also 
has been slow to start, now scheduled in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Both the city and the contractor, Taylor Woodrow Construction Corp. of Irvine, 
blame each other for the delays and are threatening legal action. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the contractor may be fined $1,000 for each day completion 
is overdue. The contractor charges that the city owes it almost $300,000 for 
city-caused cost overruns because of changes in plans and delays. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute pits the city against one of the world's largest developers. Taylor 
Woodrow, which reports an annual business of $1.3 billion according to the 
current edition of the International Directory of Company Histories, is based 
in London with its U.S. headquarters in New York. Among its many projects is 
the $310-million expansion of John Wayne Airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Ignored 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials said their $6.8-million garage project apparently is getting 
short shrift from the contractor and that repeated questions and complaints 
about delays have been largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Shick, the city's former executive redevelopment director, wrote to the 
developer in September that his letters were "inaccurate and contentious." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Pyper, Glendale building superintendent in charge of the project, 
also pleaded in a letter sent in September to Taylor Woodrow for the company to 
clarify or explain repeated delays. Pyper suggested that if a company official 
"made a mistake" in the agreement with the city, "it would be appreciated if he 
would be mature enough to state so." 
</P>
<P>
In the city's most recent letter, sent March 29 to Taylor Woodrow, Frank 
Manzano, Glendale city attorney, chided the company for its "lack of response 
and general apathetic attitude." He called for an "immediate meeting" to 
discuss the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Manzano said Tuesday that he has not had a reply. "I had hoped that they would 
call me immediately," Manzano said, "but I have not heard a thing from them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Aware of Letter 
</P>
<P>
Gareth Evans, a vice president of Taylor Woodrow in the Irvine office, said 
Tuesday he was not aware of Manzano's letter nor the specific complaints from 
Glendale. He referred calls to David Holmes, the contractor's project manager. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes declined comment, referring calls instead to Richard Johnson, the 
company's president in New York. Johnson has failed to return calls from The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The city in November hired an outside construction management firm "to provide 
documentation of the progress of work in anticipation of Taylor Woodrow's legal 
action against the city," according to a memo sent to City Manager James Ramsay 
by George Miller, public works director. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the watchdog contract is $90,000.

HIGHLAND PARK FARMERS' MARKET PLAN UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to open a city-sponsored farmers' market in Highland Park was unveiled 
by Los Angeles officials Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The plan by Councilman Richard Alatorre would create the first farmers' market 
subsidized by the city of Los Angeles. It would operate with city funds for a 
year as a pilot for city-sponsored markets in other areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said the market is intended to bring the diverse Highland Park 
community together by providing a safe and friendly atmosphere in which to buy 
fresh produce and meet people. 
</P>
<P>
There are three open-air markets in the city where farmers sell their wares 
directly to consumers, but all were started and are run by private nonprofit 
groups. At least six other cities in Los Angeles County subsidize farmers' 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre's plan is supported by the city Department of Recreation and Parks and 
by Mayor Tom Bradley. Recreation and Parks Department officials at Tuesday's 
meeting said they have tentatively agreed to allot $25,000 to start and run the 
market in its first year. As proposed, the farmer's market would eventually be 
run by a nonprofit community group. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is subject to the approval of the Board of Recreation and Parks 
Commissioners and the City Council. It is expected to be considered by the 
parks board within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Most of about 40 residents who attended Tuesday's meeting at the Highland Park 
Senior Center applauded the idea, but some said they were concerned that the 
market would increase traffic, noise and trash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's nice to have a market, but I don't think it's nice to have it in 
my back yard, which is where it's going to be," said Alice Agllman, a Highland 
Park resident whose home borders Arroyo Seco Park. "It's going to cause a big 
mess, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
The president of an association of homeowners who live near the proposed market 
site said at the meeting that he will oppose the market proposal. Alatorre said 
he will attend next week's meeting of the group -- the Hayes Avenue, Echo 
Street and Arroyo Glen Neighborhood Assn. -- to push the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But Alatorre's proposal has the support of the Highland Park Neighborhood 
Assn., the largest and most vocal homeowner's group in the Highland Park area. 
Association President Diana Barnwell said at the meeting that she supports the 
idea and will ask association members to help with the market in any way they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
The market would be at Arroyo Seco Park and Avenue 60 and would be open for 
three to five hours one day each weekend. Farmers selling their produce at the 
market would have to be have certificates from state inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers at the 23 other markets operating in Los Angeles County pay a fee to 
participate in the markets -- usually 5% of their revenue. Alatorre said his 
staff estimates that there are about 160 parking spaces next to the Highland 
Park site. 
</P>
<P>
A city-paid part-time manager would recruit farmers and promote the market. The 
cost is estimated at $14,200 a year after a start-up cost of $11,000. Alatorre 
said the market is expected to be self-sustaining by the second year. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was a project last fall of an intern in Alatorre's office. But 
Recreation and Parks Department officials have been working independently on 
such an idea for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"When Councilman Alatorre called me, I said, 'Wait, I've heard that idea 
before,' "said Ronald Kraus, senior management analyst for the Department of 
Recreation and Parks. "I think it was just a case where the ideas coalesced."

SCHOOLS SEEK $180,000 LOST IN ACCOUNTING ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whittier Union High School District is asking the Legislature for $180,000 
to make up for an accounting error by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Supt. Lowell Shira traveled to Sacramento this week to testify about 
the mistake before the Assembly Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The error happened when the county auditor-controller's office reported $1.8 
million too much in property tax revenue for the district. As a result, the 
state cut its contribution to the Whittier district by $1.8 million, and the 
district lost use of that money for six months. 
</P>
<P>
The state began correcting the error in March by increasing the district's 
monthly allotment, but Shira estimated the money would have earned the district 
about $180,000 during the first six months of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill asking for the $180,000 was sponsored by Assemblyman Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier).

PIZZA DELIVERY MAN HIT, KILLED BY POLICE CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old man delivering pizza was struck and killed last week by the car 
of a Downey police officer on his way to investigate a disturbance at a local 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Robles Soto, employed at Domino's Pizza on Paramount Boulevard, was taken 
to the Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital trauma center in Whittier, where he 
died of head injuries and internal bleeding, Detective Richard Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Dennis Vrooman was driving north on Lakewood Boulevard at 10:35 p.m. 
Friday with his car's amber lights flashing. The police car ran over Soto as he 
crossed the center divider and walked into Vrooman's path, Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
Soto had worked part time for Domino's Pizza about a year, Solis said. Soto 
took the evening position as a second job for added income to support his wife 
and three children.

VOTE CONFIRMS DENIAL OF OFFICERS' LEGAL DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the City Council voted this week not to pay for the legal 
defense of two Long Beach police officers facing misdemeanor criminal charges 
in their arrest of anti-brutality activist Don Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The vote confirms a decision made by the council in closed session last week. 
Although the city has in the past paid for the criminal defense of police 
officers, council members said they were not prepared at this time to pick up 
the legal tab for officers Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey. The council noted that 
an investigation of the officers is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and Ramsey have been charged with falsifying their arrest report on 
Jackson, and Dickey has also been charged with assaulting the activist, who was 
stopped by the officers during a sting operation secretly filmed by a 
television crew. On the videotape, which was nationally broadcast, Dickey 
appears to push Jackson into a plate glass window, which shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Warren Harwood, Wallace Edgerton and Jeffrey A. Kellogg all voted to 
pay for the officers' legal defense. "It's a matter of providing a defense for 
an employee charged in an act of duty," Harwood said later. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Bishop, the wife of a Long Beach police officer, presented the council 
with a petition signed by more than 200 residents urging the city to defend the 
pair. "What kind of message is this going to give police officers?" she asked 
after the council vote.

POLICE TO KEEP $215,000 FROM NARCOTICS RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Gate Police Department will receive $215,000 as its share of assets 
seized in a narcotics raid with other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The department assisted members of the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, 
which includes various Orange County law enforcement agencies, in a Feb. 10, 
1987, raid in the city. The raid led to the arrest of three people and the 
recovery of $5,453,624 and 18 pounds of heroin in South Gate and Riverside 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law allows law enforcement agencies to seize assets taken in narcotics 
trafficking cases. South Gate will receive its share along with the other 
participants at a 10:30 a.m. ceremony April 27 at the Westin South Coast Plaza 
hotel in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ronald George said the money will be used in prevention and 
enforcement projects. 
</P>
<P>
George said $50,000 will be used to start an anti-gang program for fourth- and 
fifth-grade students at the city's nine elementary schools and one junior high 
school. About 4,000 students will be affected. Counselors from the county 
Juvenile Assistance Diversion Effort will run the program. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $165,000 will be used to expand the department's Crime Impact 
Team, which concentrates on gang problems and car thefts, from a five-day 
operation to seven days a week. A sergeant and eight officers make up the team.

A TOTALLY RADICAL FRESHMAN; 
</P>
<P>
LINDSTROM BEATS IMAGE, CSUN FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heather Lindstrom has a somewhat unusual method of managing tense situations on 
the softball mound. When the Cal State Northridge freshman pitcher finds 
herself behind in the count, she giggles. A baserunner threatening to score in 
the 10th inning might elicit a chortle. 
</P>
<P>
And more often than not, the last laugh is also Lindstrom's. 
</P>
<P>
Her light-hearted, airy demeanor inspired Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson to 
nickname Lindstrom, "Valley girl." 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to walk up to her on the street and she said, 'I pitch for 
Northridge,' you'd laugh at her," Torgeson explained. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Berry coached Lindstrom for four seasons at Crescenta Valley High and is 
well acquainted with her happy-go-lucky approach to handling pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let that fool you," Berry said. "She does not get rattled. She'll laugh 
a lot and it will seem like her concentration is not there. But she is not 
flighty at all." 
</P>
<P>
Lindstrom dismisses insinuations that she's a stereotypical Valley girl as 
swiftly as she disposes of batters. 
</P>
<P>
"Valley girls aren't athletic," she insists. "What am I supposed to do about 
the way I look? Take hormones?" 
</P>
<P>
She finally cracks: "OK, I go out, I shop, I lay in the sun, typical Valley 
things." 
</P>
<P>
But at Crescenta Valley, Lindstrom was anything but typical. She was the 
Pacific League's Player of the Year in 1987 and 1988. In those two seasons, she 
walked a combined 11 batters and averaged nearly nine strikeouts a game. 
</P>
<P>
Despite playing with a pulled groin muscle, Lindstrom had an integral role in 
the Falcons' 1986 Southern Section 4-A title, prompting Berry to call her, "one 
of the fiercest competitors I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Lindstrom had an illustrious high school career, Torgeson 
questioned the freshman's intensity when she showed up for practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure how serious she was when she started," said Torgeson, whose 
Division II team is ranked No. 1 in the nation. "I was thinking, 'What in the 
world is this girl doing out here?' She should be at the beach or something. 
She looks like she should be spending her time at the beauty parlor." 
</P>
<P>
But Torgeson soon discovered Lindstrom could style on batters as well as style 
her locks. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take too long for the No. 2-ranked Cal State Sacramento team to 
learn, either. Lindstrom, whose record improved to 15-4 with a win Tuesday, 
pitched 17 of 19 innings of a nonconference doubleheader with Sacramento on 
Sunday, allowing just seven hits and striking out 13 batters. CSUN (44-14 
before Wednesday's game with U. S. International) won the first game in 12 
innings, 2-1, and shut out the Hornets in the second game, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Torgeson pulled Lindstrom in the first game after nine innings but, on her 
request, allowed her to pitch the entire second game. He says the game served 
as an initiation of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"She just matured Sunday," Torgeson said. "She just got that self confidence. 
That, 'Hey, I can do it. I can pitch against anybody.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Lindstrom, the performance made up for a poor outing against Sacramento in 
the championship game of the Bakersfield tournament in March. Northridge lost, 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Losing is a experience Torgeson's teams very seldom encounter. Since he began 
coaching the Matadors in 1982, Torgeson has posted a 388-114 record and won 
four of the past six national championships. 
</P>
<P>
The school's softball legacy could, understandably, fluster any freshman. And 
Lindstrom was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
"There was little bit of fear on her part at first," Torgeson said. "There is 
so much pressure to succeed and not to lose when you come into this program." 
</P>
<P>
Berry says it was the adjustment to a new coaching staff, not fear, which left 
Lindstrom apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
She has acclimated well, however, and often relies on assistant Andy Kim for 
pitch-by-pitch instructions during a game. 
</P>
<P>
Kim says Lindstrom has a knack for fine-tuning her throws under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"She corrects herself on the mound," he said. "She knows when she's thrown a 
bad pitch." 
</P>

LOCAL DRIVERS CRASH IN LONG BEACH RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Kendall and Dave Kudrave both hail from La Canada, have known each other 
since youth, attended the same high-performance driving school and have had a 
great deal of success since they took up auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
And both were involved in accidents during their respective races in the Toyota 
Grand Prix of Long Beach last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Neither driver was injured, but the outcome of their collisions differed 
greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave's crash occurred on the first lap of Sunday's 55-mile American Racing 
Series race. Traveling at about 140 m. p. h., he was rear-ended by Johnny 
O'Connell going into Turn One. The mishap knocked Kudrave out of the race and, 
by his estimation, did approximately $40,000 damage to his car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heartbreaking. It really is," Kudrave, 23, said. "There's an old saying 
in racing, 'You can't win a race on the first lap but you can certainly lose 
one.' And he (O'Connell) was trying to win on the first lap." 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave is still uncertain how the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someone was squeezing him into me," said Kudrave, who recently moved up 
from super-vee and had never crashed at the ARS level. "Or maybe he was trying 
to intimidate me and make me slow down to let him pass." 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave has traditionally had tough luck at Long Beach. Last year his gearbox 
broke, and in 1987 a pileup in front of him knocked his car out of the race. 
Both mishaps took place in super-vee events. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, 22, was more fortunate in his paint swapping. His accident came on the 
next-to-last lap of the 100.2-mile Trans Am race, catapulting Kendall into 
third place and sending Stuart Hayner's car, with which Kendall's collided, 
spinning out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kendall and Hayner were attempting to pass a slower car in a turn. 
Kendall, who was directly behind Hayner, cut to the right to slide by. Hayner, 
who apparently did not notice Kendall, also moved right to pass, clipping 
Kendall's front left fender. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kendall, there were no hard feelings between he and Hayner. 
However, Kendall says he accepts the blame. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ultimately the overtaking driver's responsibility to get by cleanly," 
Kendall said. "Obviously, in this case, the burden rests on me." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall finished second when the car of Les Lindley, which had a huge lead for 
most of the race, broke down with a quarter-mile remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Conference crushing: The Occidental College track team defeated Claremont and 
Redlands in its final Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
duel meets last weekend, ensuring the Tiger women's team of an undefeated 
conference record in the 1980s. The men's team has lost two conference duel 
meets in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
But domination was de rigueur for the Tigers long before Coach Bill Harvey 
arrived in 1979. Since World War II, Occidental has won 38 of 42 conference 
championships. Pomona-Pitzer won the other four. Several schools, including 
Claremont, have never beaten the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
This season's conference meet will be held April 28-29 at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's success does cause some problems, though. Sleepwalking to the 
winner's circle is cozy, but a lack of competition frustrates Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it wasn't a problem," Harvey said. "We won, and didn't have any 
close shaves, but the outcome wasn't totally secure. I don't think it's so much 
that we're so strong, (other teams) are just down." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Occidental has had bona fide competition this season. The Tigers 
beat UC Santa Barbara, a Division I school, and UC Riverside (Division II). 
They were beaten by San Diego State and Fresno State, both Division I teams, 
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, the defending Division II national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has qualified eight men and seven women for the Division III 
championships, which will be held in May. 
</P>
<P>
A patsy no longer: The newly-formed volleyball team at Pater Noster High is 
5-3, 3-1 in Heritage League play. 
</P>
<P>
Though the team's record is hardly overwhelming, it represents a marked 
improvement over the school's previous attempts at organized athletics this 
season. The Eagles won two basketball games and one preseason football game. 
</P>
<P>
"Football seems to be the criteria for the athletic program's success around 
here but we're getting some (attention)," Coach Jamshid Minwalla said. "I'd 
like to think there is some kind of positive note coming out of it." 
</P>
<P>
The team is led by Allan Dichosa, who averages 27 kills a game, and Martin 
Salinas, who averages a team-high 32 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Aced by anger: For those familiar with Tom Leonard, a resident of Glendale, the 
outcome of the men's singles final Sunday in the 55th Southern California 
Sectional Tennis Championships was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, known for his volatile temper, lost to Rollin Rhone, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2. 
Leonard did not take the court for the final game of the third set and was 
assessed a game penalty. Leonard did not finish the set because, he says, Rhone 
was "cheating, stalling, and pulling gamesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard claims Rhone was playing distracting mind games for much of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Said Leonard: "(Rhone) had two balls to serve with and the other ball might 
have been way over on my side of the court and he wouldn't play until he had 
the third ball. Play is supposed to be continuous. I'd be standing there to 
serve and he's standing there straightening his strings out." 
</P>
<P>
According to the U. S. Tennis Assn., the match was official. If Leonard had 
been thrown out by the umpire, he would have lost by default. If a player 
informs the umpire that he can no longer continue playing, he loses by 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said he was unmoved by the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"A little medal doesn't mean that much to me," he said. "I just want to play 
tennis. That probably meant more to (Rhone) than anything he's ever won in his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, however, did not go home empty-handed. He and partner Tom Edlefson won 
the doubles title for their division.

GOVERNOR TELLS PLAN TO REVAMP WORKERS' COMP 
</P>

<P>
Hoping he has found the answer to a thorny problem, Gov. George Deukmejian 
announced Wednesday that he has reached agreement with officials representing 
business, labor and the insurance industry on a plan to thoroughly overhaul the 
state's troubled $8-billion workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, which will require approval of the Legislature, maximum 
weekly benefits paid to hundreds of thousands of injured workers would more 
than double over the next three years, from the present $224 a week to $511 a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
As a trade-off for the increased worker benefits, the plan proposes an end to 
such practices as "doctor shopping," in which injured workers are able to 
choose their own physicians for diagnosis, and make it harder to collect for 
most psychological stress injuries, such as job burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, workers would have to select their doctors from a panel of 
physicians pre-approved by the state. Stress injuries would be flatly rejected 
unless the injuries met "objective medical standards" or the worker could show 
some physical disorder con nected to the psychological injury. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, insurance companies agreed to give up an estimated $400 
million a year in income over a three-year period by reducing rates charged to 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for creation of a major new state bureaucratic agency, 
to be called the Division of Workers' Compensation, that would have major 
responsibilities now split among the Department of Insurance and the Workers' 
Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by influential business and labor leaders as he made the announcement, 
Deukmejian called the current workers' compensation system "badly in need of 
reform" because the cost of running it is high while pay-outs to injured 
workers are among the lowest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor said the proposal "for the first time in years" would 
provide a substantial increase in benefits while putting in place what he 
described as "substantial reforms" for businesses that finance the system. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he expects soon to find one or more legislative sponsors for 
the proposal and said he hopes the Legislature "will act as quickly as 
possible" on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, however, immediately ran into strong opposition from leaders of 
the highly influential and politically well-connected California Applicants' 
Attorneys Assn., which was not among the groups that forged the agreement. The 
state's roughly 750 applicants attorneys specialize in workers' compensation 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Merle Rabine, president of the the association, criticized the proposal for 
ignoring a recent report on the workers' compensation system, which found that 
insurance company profits are rising faster than claims made by injured 
workers. He said the proposal basically ignores insurance industry profits 
while zeroing in on doctors and lawyers involved in protecting workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal is clearly an employer/insurance company protection scheme," 
Rabine said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald C. Green, another applicant attorney, said the proposal would make "it 
more difficult for injured workers to get their benefits." He also said the 
proposal would make the top weekly benefit available only to workers who earn 
at least $15 an hour by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who was briefed on 
the proposal Tuesday, reacted cooly and noncommittally. "We find it a very 
interesting product. It obviously reflects a lot of positive work by the task 
force," Roberti said in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
The workers' compensation system -- entirely financed by employer contributions 
-- was created to compensate injured workers while they are off the job and 
provide rehabilitation for those who cannot return to their old jobs but can be 
retrained for new ones. 
</P>
<P>
More than 13 million California workers are covered by workers' compensation. 
About 10% suffer some kind of job-related injury each year, but only about 
400,000 of those injured workers will actually lose one day or more of work. 
About half that number, roughly 200,000 workers, will file claims for benefits, 
according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long argued that the system is seriously flawed because workers 
receive such low benefits relative to the amount that employers pay into the 
system, about $8 billion a year. California's maximum weekly benefit has been 
frozen at $224 since 1982 and ranks 45th among states. Despite that, costs to 
employers have been soaring, up 85% since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
While there is wide agreement that something is wrong, there has never been a 
consensus on the cause for the rise in costs and the remedy. Some critics say 
that doctors and lawyers make too much money from the system, while others say 
insurance companies are reaping excess profits. Insurance companies, business 
groups, labor unions and attorneys have periodically formed alliances, then 
split apart, with none of the major players willing to make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian brought labor, business and insurance industry officials together 
last year when efforts to reach a legislative compromise on a workers' 
compensation reform bill once again failed. 
</P>
<P>
At his Capitol press conference Wednesday, the governor was flanked by John 
Henning, leader of the California Labor Federation, who has been one of the 
governor's most vocal critics over the years, as well as a group of business 
and government representatives who formed the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
They included Ed Mangiafico, chairman of the May Co. and president of 
Californians for Compensation Reform, a coalition of employers, government 
agencies and insurance companies; Kirk West, president of the California 
Chamber of Commerce; Larry Naake, president of the County Supervisors' Assn., 
and Robert Pucinelli, chairman of Industrial Indemnity, an insurance firm. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said "many months of negotiations" were required for the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The labor chief singled out the injured worker benefit increases that after 
three years will guarantee workers who qualify for the maximum payment 100% of 
the state's average weekly wage. The benefit will increase automatically after 
that without requiring legislative action, as is now the case. Workers will 
have to be earning about $15 an hour in 1992 to qualify for the maximum 
benefit, so many workers will presumably receive a lesser payment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Henning said, "This is a historic victory from our point of view. 
We no longer have to come (to the Legislature) as political beggars time and 
time again." 
</P>
<P>
Costs to employers would go up about $1 billion over three years. But business 
leaders said the various reforms in the proposal will mean that the increases 
in the future will not be nearly as dramatic as they have been.

Roberto Garcia Alvarado, 53, was killed when an unknown assailant placed a bomb 
on top of his car as it was stopped at a traffic light in the Don Rua section 
of San Salvador at about 7:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Military and U.S. officials said the attorney general was on his way to work, 
riding in the back seat of a Jeep Cherokee equipped with bulletproof windows 
and armored sides. A driver and a bodyguard sat in front while an escort car 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
However, a man who had been in the back of a pickup truck walked calmly up to 
the Cherokee, placed a bomb on top -- evidently attached by a magnet -- and 
walked away. Garcia Alvarado's driver tried to accelerate, thinking the 
movement would dislodge the explosive, but it blew up. The blast peeled away 
the top of the car and killed the official immediately. The driver and 
bodyguard were slightly wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No one took immediate responsibility for Garcia Alvarado's slaying. But 
American officials, Salvadoran military officers and President-elect Alfredo 
Cristiani blamed the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), a 
Marxist guerrilla group, for the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the guerrillas neither acknowledged nor denied the assassination, the 
front named him in a radio broadcast on March 17 as "covering up for 
murderers." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Alvarado was named attorney general by the National Assembly last 
December after the legislative body had removed his predecessor, Roberto Giron 
Flores, for allegedly being too soft on the FMLN and its sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Although not a member of the ultra right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance, 
or Arena, party, which is headed by Cristiani and controls the Assembly, Garcia 
Alvarado was a close associate of the incoming president and was known for his 
hard-line views for fighting El Salvador's nine-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
He was the highest ranking civilian official killed in the strife since 1980, 
when then-Atty. Gen. Mario Zamora was slain by right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
His death was the third killing of a right-wing figure in three months. Also, 
last Friday, a powerful bomb exploded at the house of Vice President-elect 
Francisco Merino, but he was not there at the time. All of the attacks have 
been blamed on the FMLN, although the guerrillas denied the Merino bombing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pair of Killings 
</P>
<P>
Last Feb. 18, the FMLN acknowledged killing Miguel Castellano, a former 
guerrilla leader who had defected to the government. The rebels also took 
responsibility for murdering Francisco Peccorini, a dual American-Salvadoran 
citizen who once taught at Cal State Long Beach. Peccorini was targeted by the 
rebels for leading a drive to oust leftists from the National University, a 
stronghold of guerrilla supporters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the guerrillas have murdered at least eight mayors in the past 
year and has used death threats to force the resignation of more than 100 other 
local officials. The rationale has been that mayors are legitimate military 
targets because they collaborate with the government's anti-insurgency effort. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that since 
no one had taken responsibility for the Garcia Alvarado slaying, she could not 
specifically accuse the FMLN. But in San Salvador, U.S. Ambassador William 
Walker did not hesitate to name the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," he told American reporters, "it quite obviously is an attempt by the 
guerrillas, the FMLN, to provoke a violent reaction, a nasty reaction, by . . . 
the newly elected government or the armed forces to their acts of barbarism." 
</P>
<P>
Walker called Wednesday's killing, the deaths of Castellano and Peccorini and 
the Merino bombing "pure urban terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN, he said, "definitely is trying to drag this place back to the 
violence of the early 1980s," when military- and government-supported death 
squads were killing people at the rate of 800 a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cristiani Blames Rebels 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani learned of the attack while having breakfast with foreign reporters. 
He quickly asserted that "it was the work of the FMLN. It shows the problems of 
trying to impose justice in this country." He added that "the attorney general 
had been very hard and very clear on how he was going to make sure the law was 
respected." 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani, who takes over the presidency June 1 from the centrist Christian 
Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte, agreed with Walker; the rebels want to 
provoke a violent reaction, he said, "to make the nation ungovernable by the 
time I take office." 
</P>
<P>
This theory holds that a bloody government retaliation would reawaken 
international concerns -- particularly in the United States -- that El 
Salvador's government is a collection of murderous thugs that should lose 
American economic and military aid, which now averages nearly $1.5 million a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy, Walker, Cristiani and others assert, is also aimed at marshaling 
international opinion to force the government to negotiate with the FMLN on 
sharing power in order to end the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Alvarado himself targeted the rebels and their supporters for more 
aggressive government action, saying when he took office that the army and the 
government were being pressured, presumably by the United States, into paying 
too much attention to the human rights of the leftists. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Embassy, Cristiani and other Arena party leaders play down 
the possibility, there are signs that the retaliation has already begun. In the 
last few weeks, two leaders of anti-government groups accused by rightists of 
being front groups for the guerrillas have been kidnaped, tortured and 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Vice President-elect Merino publicly named several 
civilians, including a Spanish priest, as responsible for the bombing of his 
house, although he produced no evidence. In the past, such an action has been 
tantamount to publishing a death list. 
</P>
<P>
And late last week, the army press office issued a similar list, naming the 
human rights office of the Roman Catholic Church as a guerrilla front and 
running a picture of human rights advocate Maria Julia Hernandez on national 
television.

CONFESSION A KEY ISSUE AS EX-HARVARD STUDENT IS TRIED FOR ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been more than three years since Jose Luis Razo crouched in a trash bin 
outside a La Habra dairy and made a decision that changed the course of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard University freshman had just returned home from Cambridge to spend 
the holidays with his family. Now, the day after Christmas, he hid behind the 
Driftwood Dairy, down the street from the Catholic church where, as a 
precocious grammar school pupil, he first demonstrated the academic and 
athletic abilities that would take him out of the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
With a .22-caliber pistol in his hand and a ski mask pulled over his face, Razo 
waited until there were no customers in the store, then emerged from the 
dumpster and robbed the elderly owner of $60. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid he would kill," said the robbery victim, Damnang Meas, during 
Razo's preliminary hearing in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of more than a dozen holdups that Razo, now 22, says he 
committed while home on breaks during his first two years at Harvard. His 
confession to police -- and later to The Times and other newspapers -- in July, 
1987, shocked La Habra's close-knit Latino community, which had been enormously 
proud of Razo and had expected great things of him. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Razo's trial for 10 robberies he says he committed in Orange 
County began in a Santa Ana courtroom as his lawyer and a county prosecutor 
began in pretrial motions to argue over what is shaping up as the key element 
in the case -- the admissibility of Razo's confession as evidence. Jury 
selection in the case is expected to follow in a week or so, and Razo's trial 
in Los Angeles County for three more robberies and five assaults is scheduled 
for May 31. 
</P>
<P>
But 18 months after Razo called La Habra police and confirmed their suspicions 
that he was the "ski-mask bandit" who had terrorized clerks in fast-food 
restaurants, markets and stores, the question of why remains baffling. 
</P>
<P>
Until his arrest, Razo's life had had a storybook quality: A Mexican immigrant 
raised in humble surroundings, he had excelled as a student and athlete at 
demanding parochial schools and taken on responsibility as a community youth 
leader. At Harvard, Razo was an above-average student and a hard-nosed, 
respected football player. 
</P>
<P>
What few people knew then was that there were also a few blemishes on his 
record. In 1983, a "theft matter" involving Razo was handled "informally" by 
Fullerton police, according to court documents. No further information about 
that incident was available. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Razo, then 17, was made a ward of juvenile court for stealing a wallet 
from an unlocked car in La Habra. That same year, he was charged with assault 
and battery after he got involved in a fight at a party in Brea, but the 
charges were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1986, Razo was arrested and charged with misdemeanor grand theft. The 
incident involved the theft of a watch and sunglasses from a student from a 
rival high school at a party in La Habra. That charge was dismissed the 
following year "in the interest of justice," court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Guthrie, director of the Boys' Club of La Habra, where Razo spent many 
hours as a youth, said that he and others at the club knew about the 1986 
incident, but no one paid it much heed. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept it very well hidden," Guthrie said. "It could have been a strong 
signal that something was amiss." 
</P>
<P>
Razo and family members declined recent requests to talk before his upcoming 
trial. In his statements to reporters and police in 1987, Razo said that he 
used the money from the robberies to help his family and friends and also to 
buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever my family wanted, it got," Razo said in a jailhouse interview in 
July, 1987. "I needed money for school and plane flights back and forth from 
Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he didn't fit in at Harvard and that no one there understood 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a homeboy now," Razo said, then added in Spanish: "I don't sell out my 
own ethnic identity." 
</P>
<P>
Before he dropped the case because of an unspecified conflict of interest, 
Orange County Deputy Public Defender James S. Egar said the case revolved 
around "mental issues" -- the pressures Razo felt as the symbol of success for 
a depressed neighborhood and the isolation he experienced as one of the few 
Latinos at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Razo's current court-appointed attorney in the Orange County case, John D. 
Barnett, is less inclined to talk about the problems his client might have had 
bridging the distinctive worlds of Harvard and La Habra, saying only that 
Razo's background "will have a place in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, in contrast with Egar, steadfastly maintains that his client is 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to introduce evidence showing that Razo confessed to crimes he did not 
commit and that his statements to police were obtained by "constitutionally 
deficient" means, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During Razo's preliminary hearing, defense attorney Egar attacked the validity 
of the confession on a number of grounds, contending, for example, that Razo's 
unusual behavior while talking to the police showed that his state of mind was 
"confused, vulnerable, volatile." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Arthur D. Guy Jr. ruled, however, that Razo's statements were 
made voluntarily and were admissible. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor now on the Orange County case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta, 
says he expects Barnett to attack the confession in every way imaginable -- and 
then, if it is once again ruled admissible, to drop the not-guilty plea and try 
to negotiate a reduced sentence for Razo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really expect this case to go to trial," Mehta said. "He's just got 
too much to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Because he is also charged with five counts of assault with a deadly weapon in 
Los Angeles County, Razo could face a sentence of as long as 20 years there as 
well, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Philip Millet said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, he is charged with robbing a pizza parlor in Whittier on 
two occasions and a McDonald's restaurant in Pico Rivera. During the second 
pizza parlor robbery, on Jan. 12, 1987, Razo did something he had not done in 
any of the other incidents -- he failed to cover his face with a ski mask or 
scarf, wearing only a baseball cap on his head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
That robbery is the only one in which Razo was positively identified by a store 
or restaurant employee. 
</P>
<P>
Razo spent a total of 16 months in Orange County Jail before friends and 
relatives were able to secure his release in November on $150,000 bail pending 
his two trials. 
</P>
<P>
Since he got out, Razo has tried to reconstruct some semblance of a normal 
life. He attended his brother's football games at La Habra High School last 
fall. He works for a longtime family friend and is enrolled in courses at 
Fullerton College, Boys' Club director Guthrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Razo's time in jail was a "tremendously sobering experience for him," said 
Guthrie, who sat with Razo and his parents at a couple of football games. "His 
mental attitude is very good. He seems to be somewhat quiet, subdued, very 
aware of what's going on in the world around him. 
</P>
<P>
"He realizes he's been through some rough times. . . . I think he's hopeful 
that it (the trial) will come out in the best possible way for him," Guthrie 
said, adding that exactly what that would be is "hard to define." 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to get it over with," Guthrie said.

DAPHNE DU MAURIER, AUTHOR OF 'REBECCA' AND 'THE BIRDS,' DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dame Daphne du Maurier, who once remarked, "I can't say I really like people, 
perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own," died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Monty Baker-Munton, a family friend, said he did not know the cause of death of 
one of this era's most popular novelists. "For the last fortnight (two weeks) 
she'd just been in a gentle decline," he said of the author of "Rebecca" and 
other celebrated tales. 
</P>
<P>
Dame Daphne, who also wrote such popular classics as "Frenchman's Creek" and 
"The Birds," died in her sleep at her home in the village of Par, in Cornwall, 
southwest England, he told the Associated Press. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
She had moved to that home -- a place called Kilmarth -- years ago from 
Menabilly, the legendary old graystone mansion she had immortalized as 
Manderley in "Rebecca." 
</P>
<P>
That home, gutted by Oliver Cromwell's troops during England's civil war in the 
1600s, typified the historic and adventurous splendor of Miss Du Maurier's 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 And the opening words of the gothic "Rebecca" ("Last night I dreamt I went to 
Manderley again") became one of the best-loved phrases in modern English 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 29 novels and dozens of short stories she penned in her lifetime 
ran the melded threads of romance and intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
Taking note of some minor shortcomings he found in "Rebecca," critic V. S. 
Pritchett still offered this paean to her talent: "Many a better novelist would 
give his eyes to be able to tell a story as Miss Du Maurier does, to make it 
move at such a pace and to go with such mastery from surprise to surprise. . . 
. The melodrama is excellent." 
</P>
<P>
In an art form often distinguished by economic perfidy, Miss Du Maurier, who in 
1969 was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the queen, 
had been a success since publication of her first novel in 1931 -- "The Loving 
Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
"Rebecca" alone ran to 42 printings with the last edition in 1980. Her books 
sold well into the millions but a spokesman for one of her three publishers 
said he didn't have specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
Several of her works have been adapted for film and television. "Rebecca," in 
which Joan Fontaine played the naive second wife of Sir Laurence Olivier, a 
widower with a funereal secret who is haunted by the image of his glamorous 
first wife, won an Academy Award as best picture in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
(The book itself has been described as "a Charlotte Bronte story minus 
Charlotte Bronte.") 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Hitchcock directed "Jamaica Inn," a Cornish tale of an orphan entwined 
with smugglers in 1939. Hitchcock also did "The Birds" in 1963, a stark tale of 
flocks of birds making wanton attacks on humans. 
</P>
<P>
"Frenchman's Creek," a period romance starring Fontaine and Arturo de Cordova, 
was a box-office success in 1944, while "My Cousin Rachel" and "The Scapegoat" 
also proved well-accepted films. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Du Maurier for most of her life fought an unsuccessful battle to keep her 
from being branded a Grand Dame of romance. She chose to call her writings 
"suspense adventures." 
</P>
<P>
But a fairy-tale, real-life romance had sprung from her first book, 
contributing to that dilemma and eventually bringing her a husband and three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Du Maurier was one of three daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du 
Maurier. She would one day write his biography. 
</P>
<P>
She had been educated by private tutors in Paris and at age 21 published her 
first articles and short stories. To encourage her, her publisher told her: 
"Write a novel." Thus evolved "The Loving Spirit" in 1931, a tale of the lives 
of a boat-building family she had seen in a small English seacoast town. 
</P>
<P>
The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a storied courtship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Courtship 
</P>
<P>
The officer, Frederick A. M. Browning, resolved to meet the author. They met in 
1932, married a few months later, and in the same year she published her second 
novel, "I'll Never Be Young Again." She was just 25. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rather woman's magaziny," she later remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, she became both a prolific writer and dedicated mother. As the 
novels, histories, biographies and plays developed, so did the children. She 
said the twin career was not that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always at home and that made things easier. I made a point of keeping 
some time free after the children's tea to read aloud to them." 
</P>
<P>
She told a long-ago interviewer that her favorite hideaway at Menabilly was a 
gardener's hut, where, she said, "I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking, 
chewing mints and tapping away at my typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
Browning became commander of British airborne forces in World War II and then 
treasurer to Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
After he died in 1965, she lived alone at Menabilly with her two Yorkshire 
terriers. She finally was forced to leave when its owner returned and she moved 
to Par. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971 she published "Not After Midnight," a collection of five novellas 
containing her special mix of romance and the eerie. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 she completed her autobiography, "Growing Pains." 
</P>
<P>
She admitted that she never was "so much interested in people as in types -- 
types who represent great forces of good or evil. I don't care very much 
whether John Smith likes Mary Robinson, goes to bed with Jane Brown and then 
refuses to pay the hotel bill. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am passionately interested in human cruelty, human lust and human 
avarice, and -- of course -- their counterparts in the scale of virtue."

ASSEMBLY UNIT APPROVES PLAN TO RAISE GAS TAX 5 CENTS 
</P>

<P>
A proposal by Democratic Assembly leaders to raise the state's gasoline tax by 
5 cents a gallon was easily approved Wednesday by the Ways and Means Committee 
and sent to the floor of the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
With Republicans splitting their votes, the measure by Transportation Committee 
Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) won 
the endorsement of the fiscal and budget screening committee by a 15-6 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republicans -- Assemblyman William Baker (R-Danville) and Assemblywoman 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) -- joined all the Democrats in approving the 
measure. But afterward, Baker cautioned that the Republican votes favoring the 
proposal should not be interpreted as a sign that Democrats are beginning to 
win over the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"My vote means I want to see a transportation plan pass but I don't think it's 
in its final form yet," Baker said. "I think the state desperately needs a 
transportation plan for the next 10 years. I think Mr. Katz is a player and I 
want to encourage him." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Republicans are still hoping that Democrats will compromise with 
Gov. George Deukmejian and agree that the gas tax proposal should be subject to 
voter approval in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Katz's bill is moving very, very well and I'm optimistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Katz's bill and a proposal by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) for a 
10-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax hike require a two-thirds majority vote in both 
legislative houses, but do not need a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has insisted that any gas tax increase must be approved by the 
voters. But Democratic lawmakers have steadfastly maintained that the 
Legislature would be abdicating its responsibility if it allows the electorate 
to make the ultimate decision on a gas tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's bill also calls for a 30% hike in most truck weight fees. Under the 
proposal, the gasoline tax and the fees would continue to be increased every 
two years for the next decade according to a formula based on the rate of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Katz said, the proposal would raise $21.5 billion in 
additional revenue to be used for upgrading state and local highways and 
improving and expanding mass transit facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Spending Limit 
</P>
<P>
Although voters would not have to approve Katz's specific proposal, they would 
have to change the state spending limit before any funds raised by new gas 
taxes or truck weight fees could be spent. The spending limit, called the Gann 
amendment after anti-tax crusader Paul Gann, was approved in a statewide 
election in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has proposed that the limit be modified to exempt any new revenues 
raised for transportation. Democrats have insisted that any modification must 
cover spending on an array of state services. The governor has proposed asking 
voters this November to both change the spending limit and authorize a gas tax 
increase.

Government sources said Wednesday that the free-wheeling Saudi Arabian 
financier came to the Swiss capital for cellular therapy aimed at rejuvenating 
flagging virility. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Khashoggi's Swiss doctor, who specializes in therapeutic cellular 
injections, was with the plump, 53-year-old multimillionaire in Khashoggi's 
lavish hotel suite when he was arrested at breakfast Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Khashoggi's battery of international lawyers pondered their 
strategy as their client rested in a Spartan jail cell, scarcely 100 yards from 
the five-star Schweizerhof Hotel, where he checked in Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police sources said Khashoggi was apparently recognized checking into the hotel 
by a Swiss lawyer who represents the Philippine government, which is seeking 
bank accounts of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda. 
Khashoggi has been wanted by the U.S. government on charges of helping the 
Marcoses hide wealth that they looted from their country's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, according to the sources, called the U.S. Embassy here, which then 
notified Swiss authorities that a warrant had been issued in New York City last 
month for Khashoggi's arrest and asked the Swiss to take him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment specifically charges that Khashoggi, a go-between in huge arms 
deals involving Western firms and Middle Eastern countries, unlawfully helped 
Marcos and his wife buy expensive property in New York and sell works of art 
belonging to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss Justice Ministry sources indicated that there is little chance that 
Khashoggi can avoid being extradited. 
</P>
<P>
"He can appeal to our Supreme Court," said one ministry official. "But I don't 
think they will accept his claim that he has medical problems -- not if he was 
undergoing cellular therapy to stay young." 
</P>
<P>
According to legal experts here, Khashoggi's attorneys, recognizing that there 
is little likelihood that the Swiss will turn down the extradition request, 
might decide to send him to the United States to face the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no bail in Switzerland, in ordinary circumstances, Khashoggi 
would have to remain in his cell until legal appeals were exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prisons are not bad by American standards," a Swiss official said. "Single 
cells, a cot, wash basin, toilet, table, chair. TV if you want. But it's not 
the Ritz. Some say more like the Club Med. Even so, I don't think it would 
appeal to Mr. Khashoggi." 
</P>
<P>
"If he's ultimately going back to the U.S. to face the music, why not do it 
sooner rather than later?" another Swiss expert asked Wednesday. "Besides, the 
Americans will probably let him out on bail if he makes the effort to go back. 
However high the bail, he can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
After Khashoggi arrived in Switzerland -- the Swiss are not sure from where -- 
he checked into the Schweizerhof with his daughter, Nabila, and at least four 
bodyguards, according to sources here. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi has used the medical facilities at Bern's Tiefenau Hospital before, 
say authorities here. His visits have been solely for cellular therapy, in 
which various distillates of animal fetuses are injected into humans in the 
hope of prolonging youth and virility. 
</P>
<P>
Under Swiss law, there is no reason Khashoggi's treatments could not continue 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
And there was other good news for the financier Wednesday: Prison authorities 
said he will be allowed to order meals from the renowned Schweizerhof Hotel.

CRUSHING OF SOVIET GEORGIA PROTEST SAID TO SHOW REFORMS' FRAILTY

<P>
The dispersal by riot troops of nationalist demonstrations in the southern 
Soviet republic of Georgia this month showed how the country's political 
reforms could be quickly ended, six deputies to the new, elected Soviet 
Parliament warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In an angry denunciation of the action as brutal, unjustified and threatening 
all political reform here, the lawmakers accused the troops of using a toxic 
gas against some youths and of beating and hacking at others with shovels to 
break up a peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty civilians were killed, according to government accounts, but Georgian 
political dissidents have put the figure at more than 36, with dozens of others 
missing. Officials put the number of injured requiring hospitalization at 273. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cover-Up Attempt 
</P>
<P>
The six lawmakers, declaring their determination to use their new positions to 
push for social justice, accused the Soviet authorities -- local, military and 
central -- of attempting to cover up both the means used to suppress the 
demonstrations and the results. 
</P>
<P>
After days of firm official denials that any gas or chemical agent was used, 
the government newspaper Izvestia on Wednesday quoted the Georgian minister of 
health, Irakliy Menagarishvili, as saying that the country's leading 
toxicologists have concluded that the substance used on protesters was "an 
irritant and atropine-like in effect." 
</P>
<P>
This substance, so far unidentified, was believed to have contributed to "some" 
of the deaths, a public commission appointed by the Georgian Supreme Soviet, 
the republic's parliament, had said Tuesday, making clear its intention to 
conduct a full investigation of this aspect of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet authorities acknowledged earlier this week that tear gas was used 
"in two places" to disperse the crowd, estimated at 8,000 to 10,000, an 
"atropine-like" substance, possibly inducing paralysis and even death through 
combined cardiac and respiratory failure, could mean that chemical weapons 
intended for combat were used against the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation in Tbilisi is reported as far calmer now after the 
withdrawal of the army and riot troops this week, the Georgian political 
consciousness will remain deeply scarred for a long time, officials have 
acknowledged, and the healing will depend on the honesty and openness with 
which the incident is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Givi G. Gumbaridze, the new head of the Georgian Communist Party, said in a 
nationally televised interview on Wednesday that "a dialogue with all groups, 
all sections of society is needed." 
</P>
<P>
"The people must learn all the truth, and they will be participating in 
establishing the truth of what happened," he said of the April 9 clashes. 
</P>
<P>
The party had to learn, as did others, to remain calm through debate and to see 
that it is a way forward for the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the readiness of some officials to use military force to suppress political 
dissent has, at the same time, alarmed members of the newly elected Congress of 
People's Deputies, who contend that it undermines the whole reform process, 
known as perestroika, begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"In this entire operation, it is the tendency toward instilling fear into 
people that causes concern," the six deputies, who went to Tbilisi immediately 
after the clashes, wrote in the avant-garde weekly newspaper Moscow News, 
giving a full-page summary of their own investigation into the "Tbilisi 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
"And we were really scared . . . for the fate of democratic renewal, for the 
fate of perestroika. Maybe we exaggerate a little . . . but in all that 
happened in Tbilisi could be seen a sort of model of how perestroika could be 
cut short." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most Soviet officials and the central, state-controlled news media, the 
six deputies did not start with the assumption that the demonstrators, 
participants in one of Tbilisi's prolonged political protests, were at fault 
because their all-day, all-night rally outside government offices was 
"unsanctioned" and because longtime dissidents had spoken. 
</P>
<P>
Their report calls for new laws that "truly, genuinely will be defending 
perestroika," protecting the right of political expression, and "not to put it 
in mortal danger," referring to new laws whose protection of dissent is 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
The report was signed by Yegor V. Yakovlev, editor of the Moscow News; a 
Georgian film-maker, Eldar Shengelaya; three prominent cinema directors, 
Alexander Gelman, Mikhail Belikov and Dmitri Lunkov, and a popular novelist, 
Boris Vasilyev.

BREZHNEV'S SON-IN-LAW GETTING VIP TREATMENT IN LABOR CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Accustomed to all the luxuries of life, Yuri M. Churbanov, the disgraced 
son-in-law of the late Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev, reportedly has had 
to give up only his Adidas jogging suit since entering the prison camp where he 
is to serve a 12-year sentence for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Churbanov, once the Soviet Union's first deputy interior minister, has not done 
a day's work since he was incarcerated in Labor Camp No. 12 near the city of 
Nizhny-Tagil in the Ural Mountains, the newspaper Socialist Industry reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving at the camp in late February, Churbanov has been on the camp's 
sick list, suspected of possibly having tuberculosis, although subsequent tests 
showed he did not. Prison physicians had already ruled out virtually any work 
except in the kitchen or library, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Churbanov, visited by a correspondent for Socialist Industry, is "occupying the 
best private isolation ward in the camp sanatorium," the correspondent said. 
"He did not look seriously ill at all, but was lying on his bed reading a 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
Churbanov, 52, was sentenced to 12 years under a "strict regime" for having 
accepted the equivalent of more than $150,000 in bribes for protecting 
widespread fraud in the cotton industry in Soviet Central Asia. Apparently the 
only sign of strictness, Socialist Industry reported, was the camp commandant's 
order for Churbanov to surrender his jogging suit. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, which Churbanov used to supervise as first deputy interior minister, 
is reserved for former high Communist Party, government, military and police 
officials, who are separated from the general prison population to protect them 
from possible attacks by other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Labor Camp No. 12 appears to offer a better diet than most free 
Soviet citizens have, according to the paper, and its shop is better stocked 
than most city stores. 
</P>
<P>
"For the long-term prisoner, every incidental is important," Socialist Industry 
commented. "The Ministry of Internal Affairs clearly understands this extremely 
well, and for that reason it sent the accused here." 
</P>
<P>
Were it not for a last-minute schedule change, Churbanov would have visited the 
camp in 1983 as first deputy interior minister, and other inmates recalled how 
they had spent days cleaning the camp for him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wholesale Corruption 
</P>
<P>
Churbanov, who was the country's second-ranking police official from 1980 to 
1984, was convicted along with six co-defendants, also former high-ranking 
police officials, for running an elaborate system of bribes, payoffs and 
cover-ups to protect a multibillion-dollar scheme defrauding the government for 
cotton that was never grown, let alone delivered, for fields that were never 
cleared and irrigation systems that were never built. 
</P>
<P>
The case effectively put on trial the Brezhnev Era -- an 18-year period now 
known as the "era of stagnation" -- for the wholesale corruption that it 
tolerated and even fostered in lieu of political and economic change. 
</P>
<P>
Churbanov, married to Brezhnev's daughter Galina, was portrayed during the 
four-month trial -- and in often lurid press accounts of his life style -- as a 
man of minimal talent but vast ambition whose rapid ascent was due, first, to 
Brezhnev's patronage and, second, to his own willingness to "make a deal" with 
almost anyone.

Iranian authorities have warned women that they may be punished by up to 74 
lashes if they wear makeup or see-through stockings in public. 
</P>
<P>
A notice by the State Security Council printed in Iranian newspapers this week 
warned that laws punishing violators of hijab, or Islamic covering, will be 
strictly enforced beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The notice listed eight types of violations involving the face, body and legs. 
These include exposing the hair in a vulgar way, using lipstick and eyeshadow 
in a provocative manner, wearing clothes that accentuate body curves and 
wearing see-through stockings not covered by trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Men were also warned that they should not wear "gaudy clothes which are at odds 
with public decency."

The Navy frigate Trippe and the oiler Platte collided in the Atlantic on 
Wednesday, leaving a 25-foot gash in the Platte. The vessels were taking part 
in the same exercise as the battleship Iowa, the Navy reported. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one minor injury. A crew member got his knee bruised," a Navy 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Platte and Trippe were participating in the same Atlantic Fleet exercise, 
Fleetex 3-89, as the battleship Iowa, on which at least 47 sailors were killed 
in an explosion and fire in a gun turret. 
</P>
<P>
The Platte and Trippe were not in the same operating area, a spokesman said. 
The frigate and oiler were 500 miles east of Jacksonville, Fla., while the Iowa 
was 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy was investigating the cause of the collision.

ASTEROID'S PASSING A 'CLOSE CALL' FOR EARTH, NASA SAYS

An asteroid half a mile wide, blazing through space at nearly 50,000 m.p.h., 
skirted past Earth last month in a cosmic "close call" unrivaled in the last 50 
years, NASA officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The asteroid, identified as 1989FC, passed within 500,000 miles of Earth -- 
about twice the distance to the moon -- on March 23, the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
"On the cosmic scale of things, that was a close call," said Dr. Henry Holt, an 
amateur astronomer from Flagstaff, Ariz., who discovered the asteroid while 
working on a NASA project. 
</P>
<P>
Bevan French, a scientist with NASA's solar system exploration division, said 
if the asteroid had collided with Earth the impact would have been equivalent 
to the explosion of 20,000 hydrogen bombs and would have created a crater at 
least 5 miles across -- or "enough to destroy a good-sized city." 
</P>
<P>
If it had hit an ocean, it would have caused tidal waves that would have swept 
over coastal regions, French said.

GUNPOWDER IGNITION DURING LOADING MAY BE TO BLAME; 
</P>
<P>
EXPLOSIONS RARE IN NAVIES' BIGGEST GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The 16-inch guns involved in Wednesday's disaster aboard the Iowa have been a 
standard fixture on U.S. Navy battleships since the early part of the century 
-- and, surprisingly, have not changed much in concept since they were first 
deployed. 
</P>
<P>
The guns are the largest still in use by any navy, either of a Western country 
or a Communist Bloc nation. And the ships that carry them -- the 45,000-ton 
"battlewagons" of naval lore -- are the Navy's oldest and most romantic 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
The turret on which the guns are mounted is a rotating gun platform that 
extends down into the ship in the form of a huge cylinder. The cylinder itself 
has decks on several levels. The guns' ammunition is stored here and in 
compartments -- called magazines -- along the cylinder side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silk Bags of Gunpowder 
</P>
<P>
The ammunition looks something like a very long bullet that has been cut into 
small pieces. The head -- or projectile, as it's called -- is loaded into the 
breech (the rear) of the gun-barrel first. Behind it comes the powder -- in six 
cylindrical 110-pound silk bags. 
</P>
<P>
To fire the projectile, the gun crew sets off a primer -- essentially a blank 
cartridge that in turn explodes to light a special igniting powder that 
generates enough fire to make the gunpowder explode. The explosion from the 
gunpowder propels the projectile to its target. 
</P>
<P>
The projectile and the bags of gunpowder are hoisted by separate elevators from 
their storage compartments in the lower part of the cylinder. A pneumatic ram 
packs the various components into the barrel before firing. Each gun crew has 
its own walled-in compartment. 
</P>
<P>
Turret explosions, especially involving 16-inch guns, are rare. "I can't even 
recall one that ever happened before," said Al Carney, who served as commanding 
officer of the Missouri from 1986 to June of last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Malfunctions Described 
</P>
<P>
Naval experts say turret explosions usually can be traced to one of three 
malfunctions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the powder bags are loaded so that the igniting powder is pointing away 
from the primer rather than toward it, the result could be a "hangfire." The 
gunpowder would not explode, but it could be consumed in a slow, smoldering 
fire that could prove dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the gun crew inadvertently leaves bits of burning debris in the barrel 
from the powder bags that were used in firing the previous round, they could 
set off the next round prematurely. Powder bags are made of silk because it 
burns more completely than other fabrics, but some smoldering residue is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the powder ignites accidentally, either in the powder hoist or in the 
handling room at the base of the turret, the result could be tragic. Because so 
many men -- 47 at last count out of a 71-man turret crew -- were killed in the 
accident, speculation is that the Iowa suffered just such a mishap. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loading Accident Suspected 
</P>
<P>
"For 47 people to have died, the explosion would have to have occurred 
somewhere in the loading cycle," Carney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
David R. Cox, a retired Navy captain who served aboard the Iowa as a 
midshipman, said the flooding reported in the Iowa's turret could have been 
intentional. Crews traditionally flood compartments in disabled turrets to 
prevent any fire from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
The ammunition is large and unwieldy by any standard. Each projectile for a 
16-inch gun weighs 2,700 pounds. The 110-pound powder bags are 16 inches in 
diameter and about a foot and a half in length. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Gene La Rocque, a highly decorated World War II veteran who serves as 
director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington, told Reuters on 
Wednesday that most often "sparks traditionally set old-fashioned bag 
ammunition off." 
</P>
<P>
Once the blast occurred, he said, the turret had to be sealed off and the men 
inside had no chance to get out. "There is no escape for anyone from the fire, 
the heat, the blast, the debris," he said. "The battleship turret is a giant 
steel tomb." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAJOR NAVY ACCIDENTS 
</P>
<P>
These were among the major explosions, fires, collisions and similar disasters 
in the Navy in this century: 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1, 1972 -- During the Vietnam War, there was an explosion in the center 
gun of turret No. 2 of the heavy cruiser Newport News during shore support 
operations, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36. 
</P>
<P>
June 2, 1969 -- Destroyer Frank E. Evans collided with Australian carrier 
Melbourne in South China Sea, killing 74. 
</P>
<P>
May 21, 1968 -- Nuclear submarine Scorpion sank in the Atlantic with 99 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
July 29, 1967 -- Fire ravaged the aircraft carrier Forrestal off the coast of 
Vietnam, 134 died. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 26, 1966 -- Aircraft carrier Oriskany caught fire in the Gulf of Tonkin, 
with 43 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
April 10, 1963 -- Submarine Thresher sank in the Atlantic, killing 129. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 19, 1960 -- Aircraft carrier Constellation caught fire at her berth in New 
York City. There were 50 fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
May 26, 1954 -- Aircraft carrier Bennington exploded and burned near Quonset 
Point, R.I., killing 107. 
</P>
<P>
April 26, 1952 -- Destroyer Hobson collided with the carrier Wasp in the 
Atlantic and sank, killing 175 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
April 21, 1952 -- Powder explosion occurred in a gun turret aboard the cruiser

PANEL BACKS 2 BILLS TO CURB ASSAULT RIFLES

Sweeping legislation that would outlaw new assault rifles won an important 
boost Wednesday as a Senate subcommittee -- sidestepping a potential deadlock 
-- voted 5 to 1 to send a pair of competing proposals to full committee for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures would ban the importation and sale of such well-known 
military-style rifles as the AK-47, the Uzi carbine and the Colt AR-15, but 
they differ in the number of other types of guns that would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Although unable to decide between the two versions, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution made clear its determination to 
ban such weapons and urged the full committee to move quickly to send the 
legislation to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure on White House 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming sentiment behind an assault gun ban puts additional pressure 
on the White House, which has taken no official position on the issue while a 
monthlong review has been in progress. The senators urged the Administration to 
make its position clear but said they were reluctant to postpone action until 
President Bush makes up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day we wait, every day we ponder . . . we put at risk the lives of our 
fellow citizens," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) warned. 
</P>
<P>
One of the measures was sponsored by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), a 
lifelong opponent of gun control who told reporters that he had decided to 
change his position because "this issue demands action." 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a major step because of the urgency that this issue brings," 
Matthew McCoy, a DeConcini aide, said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the DeConcini bill nor a broader measure backed by Sen. Howard M. 
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) would affect weapons already owned or those used by law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But both go far beyond the temporary action already imposed by the Bush 
Administration, which bars the importation of certain assault weapons until 
officials can decide whether they generally are used for legitimate sporting 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation would immediately halt the sale of certain foreign- 
and U.S.-made assault rifles without regard to their use. It would mark a major 
shift in federal policy, which generally has left rifles unregulated out of 
concern for the rights of hunters. 
</P>
<P>
"This legislation," insisted Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), the subcommittee 
chairman, "will not in any way affect the rights of hunters or responsible 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The DeConcini bill, which covers nine types of assault weapons, is considerably 
less far-reaching than Metzenbaum's, which would cover 25 assault weapons and 
give the secretary of the Treasury authority to ban other weapons for one year 
on an emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum earlier had backed even more stringent provisions that would have 
empowered the Treasury secretary to ban weapons permanently and require that 
currently owned assault weapons be registered with the federal government. 
Those provisions were dropped to gain more support, however. 
</P>
<P>
But DeConcini and his principal supporter, Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), 
indicated that they still regard the Metzenbaum measure as too sweeping and 
said it might hamper hunters who favor certain semiautomatic rifles and 
shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Because the subcommittee was divided in its support for the two bills, neither 
appeared likely to gain a majority. Rather than permit the initiative to become 
stalled, the panel voted to report both bills to the full committee without 
saying which it preferred. 
</P>
<P>
Police have contended that semiautomatic weapons, which are equipped with large 
magazines and other military-style accessories, are favored by drug traffickers 
and have contributed to outbreaks of violence in a number of major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Public pressure for a ban on the weapons has mounted since early this year, 
when welder Patrick Purdy used an AK-47 to kill five children and wound 29 
others in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, only Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) among members of the subcommittee 
opposed both measures, voicing concern that any effort to ban assault weapons 
might easily be expanded to include hunting rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real assault that the so-called assault weapons bills make is on the 
law-abiding citizen," Hatch said, calling instead for "tougher anti-crime 
measures aimed at those who misuse the weapons."

FEMALE WORKER WINS $885,000 IN BIAS SUIT 
</P>

<P>
A former Orange County Register circulation manager who says she was passed 
over for promotion twice in favor of less-qualified men won $885,000 from the 
newspaper Wednesday in a sex-discrimination award that legal specialists called 
one of the largest of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just ecstatic," said Susan L. Martinolich, 43, of Orange. "This means that 
women at the paper are going to have to be taken more seriously, particularly 
in the circulation department. Women aren't going to be afraid to stand up and 
be counted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Prove 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits seeking to show sex discrimination in employment practices are 
extremely toughto prove and rarely go to trial, experts say. But Martinolich's 
victory was mostly remarkable for the size of its punitive damages -- $800,000 
-- because she was not fired and was suing the newspaper alone, rather than as 
part of a class-action group, legal experts in the field said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew, finding that 
Martinolich was in fact discriminated against based on gender, accepted with 
only minor variations a jury verdict handed down the previous day after a 
two-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anger at Verdict 
</P>
<P>
Register officials expressed anger and surprise at the verdict and denied any 
wrongdoing in their treatment of Martinolich, who still works at the newspaper 
but has transferred out of the circulation department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miscarriage of justice, plain and simple," said Tom Peterson, vice 
president for circulation. "My reaction is one of absolute shock, and so too 
with everyone in the department and this newspaper. We don't believe for a 
minute that we did anything to discriminate against her." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and the newspaper's lead attorney in the case said they expect to 
appeal the jury's decision.

A 72-year-old man has become the first cardiac patient in the nation to take 
home a remote-control defibrillator, a device through which doctors can deliver 
a life-saving jolt of electricity by telephone, officials at Sacred Heart 
Hospital announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The defibrillator, called MDphone, is linked to the hospital so that doctors 
can intervene in cases of cardiac arrest as well as monitor a patient's heart 
rate through a standard telephone hookup. The name of the patient was not

REDONDO OPTS FOR OWN UNIFIED SCHOOL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move that could accelerate unification of school districts in 
three beach cities, the Redondo Beach school board has decided to form its own 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade system. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-1 decision Tuesday apparently closes the door on proposals to form a 
single large district by consolidating elementary schools in Redondo Beach, 
Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach with the South Bay Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the Redondo Beach plan would lead to the dissolution of the high 
school district that serves the three cities. Redondo Beach would take over 
Redondo Union High School, leaving Manhattan Beach to form a separate K-12 
district around the grade schools in that city and its local high school, Mira 
Costa. 
</P>
<P>
The small district in Hermosa Beach would merge its single elementary school 
with one of the new unified systems. Redondo Beach, in mapping out its own 
plan, formally invited Hermosa Beach to join. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Control Our Destiny' 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to move forward," Redondo Beach board President Rebecca Sargent said 
Wednesday. "We have a great opportunity here to control our own destiny. We 
will be able to continue the programs that we believe are best for our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Sargent said the board has all the information it needs on the unification 
issue and is confident that most residents want to maintain local control 
rather than become part of a larger school system. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Nick Parras said Wednesday that he expects to come up with a detailed 
unification plan by fall. After public hearings, the plan would be converted to 
a petition that would have to be signed by at least 25% of the city's 
registered voters to qualify for review by county and state agencies. Hermosa 
Beach voters would be included if that city decides to join the new Redondo 
Beach school system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Hermosa Beach, Supt. Shalee Cunningham said her board wants to keep its 
options open until "we get more input from the community." She said a survey 
will be started next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We graduate about 100 students a year, and most of them go to Redondo Union," 
she said. "There's a tremendous loyalty to that school." 
</P>
<P>
The final step in the unification process is a vote in the affected 
communities, which presumably would be the three beach cities. Parras said such 
an election could occur as early as fall, 1990, and a new, unified district 
could begin operations a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Sylvia Zellers cast the only vote against Redondo Beach going it alone. 
She said a larger school system would provide more educational advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Palm, president of the high school district, said he was surprised by 
Redondo Beach's abrupt decision to break off discussions with the other 
districts. The talks began in January, at the high school district's behest, 
and expanded into several public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the boards of the four districts tentatively agreed to hire a 
consultant to study the pros and cons of a single, 10,000-student system. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we don't know where this is going," Palm said. "It's out of our 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
If the district is split between Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach, Palm said, 
Mira Costa will lose about one-third of its students, making it too small to 
continue many of the elective programs offered there and at Redondo Union. 
Students lost by Mira Costa would go to Redondo Union, where enrollment would 
rise to about 2,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each school now has about 1,500 students, but that level at Mira Costa has been 
maintained by assigning 400 to 500 Redondo Beach students to the campus in 
Manhattan Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to thinking about the welfare of students in all three cities," 
Palm said. "We're concerned that splitting the (high school) district will not 
be in the best interests of some students." 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in all the districts has fallen sharply in the last 15 to 20 years. 
Unification has been proposed in the past, but the movement this year is the 
first that appears almost certain to result in mergers.

22 LOSE JOBS AT PORT AUTO PREP FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-two Teamsters Union workers who prepared foreign cars for shipment to 
dealerships on the West Coast were laid off this week after the sale of three 
Terminal Island auto processing firms where they worked. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs reduced by 10% the work force at Crown Auto Body, Overseas 
Processing Co. and Terminal Island Processing Co., which have been purchased by 
T &amp; T Auto Transport Co. 
</P>
<P>
T &amp; T, the American subsidiary of an Australian transportation 
conglomerate, completed the purchase of the three firms last Friday and 
announced the layoffs Monday, said Steve Sayer, a company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Teamsters Automotive, Industrial and Allied Workers 
Local 495 plans to meet this week with T &amp; T officials to discuss the 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is concern, obviously," said George Park, a business representative for 
the local. "We are trying to see now if there is anything we can do to get them 
reinstated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remove Nicks, Scrapes 
</P>
<P>
The employees were among about 200 at the Terminal Island firms who remove 
nicks and scrapes from cars shipped to Los Angeles from overseas. They also 
install stereos and other accessories, wash cars and load them onto trucks and 
railroad cars for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
Sayer said the workers were laid off because the Terminal Island auto 
processors will have 17% fewer cars to work on this year than last. He declined 
to give specific numbers but said the loss of business was caused by three 
luxury car makers moving to other ports. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, BMW and Jaguar stopped importing through Crown Auto Body 
at the Port of Los Angeles. Both companies now send their cars through Port 
Hueneme in Ventura County, where they have built their own car processing 
plants. In addition, Saab this year terminated its contract with Crown Auto 
Body and began shipping its cars through the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Los Angeles estimated that 480,000 imported cars passed over its 
docks in the 1985-86 fiscal year, and port officials said they eventually hoped 
to handle 600,000 cars a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the move of some car makers to other ports, as well as a general slump in 
imports because of the weakness of the U.S. dollar, has reduced shipments 
through Los Angeles. The port took in 447,000 cars in the 1987-88 fiscal year, 
the most recent figures available, said Jeff Leong, a spokesman for the port. 
</P>
<P>
T &amp; T hopes to prevent further slippage by improving the quality of its 
operation, Sayer said. "That's a concern we have," he said. "We are going to 
watch it closely." 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Crown Auto Body, Overseas Processing Co. and Terminal Island 
Processing Co. met with T &amp; T management last Friday and learned about the 
possible layoffs. The company interviewed all non-management employees over the 
weekend and announced the layoffs Monday.

LITTLE LEAGUER KNIFED BY GANG MEMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
LAWNDALE CALLS FOR MORE DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a marked increase in graffiti and gang activity in Lawndale, the 
City Council has voted to ask the Sheriff's Department to consider diverting 
some deputies from traffic enforcement to crime control duties. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the knifing of a 13-year-old boy who was jumped by gang members on his 
way to Little League practice last week, Councilman Larry Rudolph called for 
immediate council action Monday night, placing his sheriff's staffing plan on 
the agenda as an urgency item. 
</P>
<P>
The boy is recovering from his injuries, but public concern about gangs is 
running high in Lawndale, with four meetings in the past week focusing on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph suggested that to combat gangs, two traffic enforcement teams be 
reassigned to crime patrol in local parks and residential neighborhoods. He 
also proposed designating a third team as an anti-gang unit. These changes 
could be made with minimal costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to seek a Sheriff's Department analysis of the 
plan, which also calls for non-uniformed city or county personnel to take 
accident reports to free officers to handle crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In casting her vote, Mayor Sarann Kruse said the council should move quickly to 
keep gangs out of Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Walt Lanier agrees. "Without question, gang activity has 
increased (in Lawndale)," Lanier said Tuesday in an interview. "This is not 
like the hard-core gang activity going on in the northern (Lennox) part of the 
district, but nevertheless they are using the same names and trappings." 
</P>
<P>
Incidents of graffiti nearly doubled in March over February, according to 
records, and Lanier said such public wall writings are "a telltale sign" of 
increased activity. 
</P>
<P>
He applauded this week's anti-gang events including a "Say No to Gangs" march 
Saturday, City Council discussions Monday and today and a Neighborhood Watch 
meeting Tuesday. Without swift intervention, he said, gangs can become a deadly 
cancer that cannot be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 125 residents marched a mile through Lawndale to demonstrate 
community determination to keep rival gangs from making a battleground out of 
Lawndale. Neighborhood Watch coordinator Nancy McKee said that in staging the 
march, residents "are saying they don't want that kind of element in our city." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's council meeting, Planning Commissioner Pam Sturgeon said the recent 
attack on the Little League player has made parents fearful for their 
children's safety. "Why should we have to lock our children up in our homes to 
keep them safe?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday night, about 60 Neighborhood Watch coordinators and residents, 
many of them elderly, gathered at City Hall for a program on gangs. At the 
meeting, Sheriff's Deputy Warren Asmus described gang members as "our own local 
terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Asmus, a member of the Sheriff's Department team that presents anti-drug and 
gang-resistance programs in schools, said that while gang activity in Lawndale 
may not be as intense as in Lennox or South-Central Los Angeles, the community 
should band together now to keep it from becoming entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Place Immune 
</P>
<P>
In answer to worried queries about where gang activity is worst, Asmus said no 
neighborhood is immune from gangs. Drug profits have enabled gang members to 
buy cars and range widely throughout Southern California and beyond, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has received numerous requests from law enforcement 
agencies nationwide because local gangs have exported their drug activities to 
new territories, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents watched intently as Asmus showed slides and interpreted the meanings 
of graffiti showing the presence of rival Crips and Bloods. Among the most 
active in Lawndale is the Hawthorne Piru Gangsters, whose members wear red to 
show their affiliation with the Bloods, Asmus said. 
</P>
<P>
He urged residents to join together to form a neighborhood presence to detect 
and report gang activity. A key problem for law enforcement is that people are 
reluctant to report crimes by gangs for fear of retaliation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retaliations Rate 
</P>
<P>
Asmus said gang members retaliated against witnesses in only about 1% of the 
cases he has handled. 
</P>
<P>
At tonight's City Council meeting, Gary McDonald, chairman of the Lawndale 
Planning Commission, plans to propose that the city seek damages from the 
parents of those who write graffiti on walls. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Monday took some immediate steps to deal with the dramatic 
increase in graffiti noted in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Calls for the city's graffiti removal service have increased considerably, the 
staff reported: In February, there were 204 calls for 7,082 square feet of 
work, while in March, there were 369 calls for 11,162 square feet of work. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed that one employee who has been spending 60% of his time on 
graffiti removal be assigned to work full-time at it. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a plan to distribute coupons that entitle residents 
to small amounts of free paint for covering graffiti.

CAMPAIGN FAILS TO OUST BOARD OF AILING SAN PEDRO PENINSULA HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month of controversy over who should control financially ailing San Pedro 
Peninsula Hospital ended in less than half an hour Tuesday night when an effort 
to replace the present 15-member board of directors collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Members of San Pedro Peninsula Health Services -- the community corporation 
that owns the hospital and elects the board -- overwhelmingly voted to support 
the present board. As a result, a dissident group of corporate members never 
offered its expected motion to recall the board and elect its own proposed 
slate of directors. 
</P>
<P>
In making the motion of support, John Greenwood, a former member of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District board, called hospital directors heroes and 
said they have provided a "strong voice of leadership" in solving hospital 
problems that led to an estimated $8 million in losses during 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Of 229 corporate members who packed the hospital auditorium for the special 
election meeting, only six opposed the motion of support in a show of hands. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Hansen, chairman of the dissident Committee to Save San Pedro 
Peninsula Hospital, conceded that the group lost its battle to persuade the 
community that the present board is unable to solve the hospital's problems. 
The committee has contended that those problems could lead to bankruptcy or a 
takeover by a profit-making chain. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hansen said he believes the committee members who 
successfully petitioned for the meeting succeeded in their purpose of informing 
the community about the hospital crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The severe financial condition of the hospital is now open and obvious to all 
of the current board of directors, whose duty it is to correct the condition," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Orosz, hospital board chairman and an emergency room physician at the 
hospital, made a strong case for the board. "The board has not done a perfect 
job, but it is willing to learn," he said in opening the meeting. "This is 
better than replacing them with others that we do not know," Orosz said, 
referring to the committee's proposed slate of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Launched more than a month ago when petitions were filed calling for the 
special board election, the fight for control of the hospital got into high 
gear last week when the hospital board and executives labeled the election 
meeting a "hostile takeover" attempt that could destroy the 64-year-old 
community hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials have said steps already are being taken to put the troubled 
hospital back in the black. They also speculated that the dissident group might 
be planning to sell the hospital or bring back the former president, Rodney 
Aymond, who was forced to resign Jan. 25 after the board blamed him for 
management problems. Hansen denied those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the acrimony that preceded it, Tuesday's meeting had an atmosphere of 
conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of good has come out of this," Orosz said in his opening statement. "One 
benefit is that attention has been brought to bear on (the hospital's) 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
He said "there will be better communication" with the community, including 
annual or semi-annual meetings of the corporation, which Orosz said has not met 
for at least 15 years. Corporate members have voted for hospital directors by 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said harmony is needed to solve the hospital's financial crisis, adding 
that the committee "will support the corrective action of the board of 
directors" while remaining "vigilant and concerned." 
</P>
<P>
However, Tuesday's atmosphere of conciliation is not being extended to a 
lawsuit filed last week in Long Beach Superior Court by a group of San Pedro 
cardiologists aimed at identifying authors of an anonymous nine-page document 
circulated in San Pedro during the hospital battle. 
</P>
<P>
The document asserts that the hospital pays above-market rates to physicians 
for certain contract services and that a "power group" of physicians benefiting 
from these contracts controls the hospital for their own benefit. The citizens 
committee denied authorship, but Hansen said the committee agrees with the 
document's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce N. Goldreyer, chief of staff at the hospital and a member of the 
medical group that was named in the anonymous document, said the suit will be 
pressed because it "bears no relationship" to the hospital corporation or 
makeup of the hospital board. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a conspiracy to interfere with my ability to practice, to defame me and 
my practice, that began before the recall attempt," Goldreyer said. He said he 
believes some people associated with the citizens committee are involved.

LOSS OF PRIVATE FUNDS THREATENS REFERRAL AGENCY 
</P>

<P>
A Van Nuys-based agency that matches troubled children with appropriate 
counseling services is in the midst of a financial crisis that has left its 
staff members struggling to keep the doors open for the next 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
The Juvenile Justice Connection Project, which relies almost entirely on 
private donations for its annual operating budget, needs $121,000 to pay the 
minimum expenses of running the agency for the rest of the fiscal year ending 
June 30, said executive director Valerie Hopkins. Staff members said Wednesday 
that their board of directors is carrying out an emergency fund-raising 
campaign to keep the agency running. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working like crazy not to close the doors," said Barbara Bruckman, the 
agency's development director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Referrals for Children 
</P>
<P>
Founded eight years ago by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Irwin 
Nebron, the project aims to keep troubled children from becoming criminals by 
referring them to psychological counselors, educational therapists, alcohol and 
drug abuse programs and other support services. 
</P>
<P>
Children, who are sent by police officers, judges, school officials, ministers 
and others, are assessed by one of the agency's counselors and then directed to 
appropriate treatment programs. The assessment and referrals are free. The 
treatment programs also are free to those can't afford them, while others pay a 
low fee based on their financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stop the Cycle' 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to act as a preventive to help kids before they get into gangs, 
before they drop out of school, before they become criminals. Somebody has to 
stop the cycle," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget shortfall stems from several charitable foundations' decisions not 
to give the agency any more grant support, Hopkins said. These foundations 
supported the project in past years, and the staff was counting on the money 
for the balance of their $769,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
"These foundations tell us we are a fantastic organization, with a fantastic 
history, and they are so thrilled we are doing so well, and then tell us we 
should seek a permanent source of funding," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Often Cut 
</P>
<P>
A consultant to charitable groups said foundations often cut off support for 
projects they help launch, since a growing number of nonprofit agencies are 
competing for their support. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the curse of the nonprofit organization," said Alan Kumamoto of the 
Center for Non-Profit Management. "Foundations have limited dollars and they 
are trying to spread their monies around because of all the different needs out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins said the agency pared its annual budget down to $572,000, which covers 
only minimum operating costs, such as employee salaries, rent and insurance. 
The staff of 25 has dwindled by attrition to 16 people working overtime to 
continue to provide the same level of services as before the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cutbacks, the agency still does not have enough money to cover its 
basic expenses for the next 2 1/2 months, she said. "We are in a real cash 
crunch, and we don't have any money to carry us." 
</P>
<P>
In July, the project will receive grant monies for the next fiscal year, she 
said, adding that by then the staff hopes to have new sources of funding that 
will prevent it from similar crises in the future.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GENERAL PLAN REPORT ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has called for a detailed report in 30 days on 
possible November ballot measures that would clarify how the city's General 
Plan should be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The council Monday debated legal and practical questions raised by a recent 
state attorney general's opinion on the General Plan, a document that governs 
all zoning and development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 20 opinion upheld the validity of a 1963 ordinance requiring that any 
General Plan be submitted to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have never voted on the current General Plan, because a 1974 opinion 
by the attorney general's office held that the 1963 law was unconstitutional. 
Relying on the 1974 opinion, the council in 1976 adopted the city's General 
Plan without putting it before the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent reversal in favor of the 1963 law, city officials are 
attempting to resolve questions about how the General Plan should be adopted. 
The city is in the process of updating the 1976 plan, and the council is 
considering whether the old plan and/or the new plan should be put to a 
citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission has recommended that the council put the 1963 law, 
called Ordinance 82, on the ballot in November to see whether public opinion 
has changed or whether Lawndale residents still want the General Plan to be 
subject to voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
The council also is considering whether amendments to the plan should be 
submitted to the electorate, and how to define major changes that should be 
subject to a vote as opposed to minor changes that could be handled 
administratively.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN ZONE CHANGE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to change the zoning of a 
block in the old downtown area, requiring a public hearing before any 
construction takes place on that block. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition to the City Council, 16 residents of the 1000 block of Amapola 
Avenue had asked the city to help preserve the block by declaring it an 
historic overlay district. During the meeting Tuesday some residents said they 
feared that without the historic zoning, developers may tear down older homes 
and build large condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the only block left (in the area) that is original," said Mary Comon, a 
resident of Amapola Avenue. "We are one of the last unique blocks." 
</P>
<P>
The council opted against a historic overlay district because no such district 
exists in the city, and it would take city staff months to develop one. Instead 
the council voted to create a precise plan zone, which will require that each 
building application have a public hearing before the city Planning Commission. 
However, existing buildings could be demolished without a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the City Council voted to downzone a 10-block downtown area, 
including the 1000 block of Amapola Avenue, to control density. The council 
also imposed a building moratorium until May 4, when the new zoning will become 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, residents said they are not satisfied with the council 
action and fear that once the moratorium is lifted, developers will begin 
demolition of houses on the block. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want condos next door," said Amapola resident Donna Braly. "We don't 
want all that density."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS ASSAULT-GUN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voting 4 to 1, the Lawndale City Council has given preliminary approval to an 
ordinance banning the sale of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman had urged adoption of such a 
law shortly after a Stockton incident in which five schoolchildren were killed 
and 29 injured by a gunman with an AK-47 assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Harold E. Hofmann voted against the ban, citing his belief in the 
constitutional right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
The state Assembly has approved a bill banning the sale of most military-style 
assault weapons and severely restricting their possession by private citizens. 
That legislation is expected to be put to a state Senate vote today. If 
approved, it would supersede the Lawndale law.

WALKER DEFENDS HIS MOBIL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to respond to those publicly opposing my petition drive to qualify an 
initiative to prohibit the storage of large quantities of hydrofluoric acid at 
the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, with the exception of the Mobil Oil Corp., who has studied the issue 
agrees that hydrofluoric acid is an extremely lethal chemical that could, in 
the case of an accidental spill, threaten the lives of tens of thousands of 
Torrance residents. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, with the exception of the Mobil Oil Corp., who has studied the issue 
agrees that the Mobil refinery has one of the worst safety records in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent a catastrophic accident from happening here in Torrance, we must 
eliminate the threat. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I have been working the past eight months on a ballot initiative 
which prohibits the storage of large quantities of hydrofluoric acid. And that 
is why I and my City Council colleagues filed a lawsuit last week against Mobil 
Oil Corp. which asks for a permanent injunction against the use of hydrofluoric 
acid and other, less dangerous chemicals within the city of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
But to defeat the mighty Mobil Goliath, this cannot be a battle between one 
councilman and Mobil, or seven council members and Mobil. Torrance residents 
must be brought into the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Only by allowing Torrance voters to speak out at the ballot box will Mobil -- 
and their high-priced lawyers -- truly understand that Torrance residents 
demand action now. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not politics, or the perceived political ambitions of myself. The 
issue is nothing less than the health and safety of you and your family. 
</P>
<P>
If you have not yet done so, please sign your initiative petition and mail it 
to me today.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4TH YOUTH ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF MAN WHO 
INTERRUPTED THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Wednesday arrested the last of four young men accused in the killing 
of a North Hollywood man who was shot when he tried to prevent a car theft 
April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Russell, 18, of North Hollywood was in custody on an unrelated car theft 
charge when officers booked him on suspicion of murder, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Mike Coffey. Officers had arrested Russell in North Hollywood on 
Friday when they noticed that he was driving a stolen car, Coffey said. The 
officers were not aware that Russell was suspected in the killing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said statements by witnesses led detectives to suspect that Russell was 
involved in the killing. Russell is to be arraigned today in San Fernando 
Municipal Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Darris Garvin, 37, was killed after he spotted four young men trying to steal a 
neighbor's pickup truck in the garage of the apartment complex where he lived, 
police said. Garvin had chased the four for about a block when one of them shot 
him with a handgun, police said. Garvin later died at St. Joseph Medical Center 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Police last week arrested three juveniles on suspicion of murder. The three, 
who are affiliated with a North Hollywood gang, are scheduled to be arraigned 
next week in Sylmar Juvenile Court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said. Nison 
said he will ask that they be tried as adults.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HURT IN POLICE PURSUIT OF STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was injured Wednesday when two youths in a stolen car led officers on a 
high-speed chase through Glendale, hitting five other cars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Vidal, 19, and a 15-year-old boy, both of Glendale, were arrested on 
suspicion of grand theft auto after the 10-minute chase, which ended when a 
police car rammed the stolen Chevrolet Blazer, causing it to hit a palm tree, 
Glendale police Sgt. Brad Liston said. 
</P>
<P>
Salvator Marino, 57, of Glendale was treated at Glendale Adventist Hospital for 
shoulder pains after his car was broadsided by the suspects' vehicle at the 
intersection of Brand Boulevard and Goode Avenue, police said. Two other moving 
cars and three parked cars also were hit by the fleeing car, Liston said, but 
there were no other reported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began at about 1:50 p.m. when police spotted the Chevrolet that had 
been reported as stolen from a restaurant parking lot 20 minutes earlier, 
authorities said. After police attempted to stop the vehicle, the suspects 
drove at speeds up to 60 m.p.h through at least six city streets, jumping curbs 
and knocking down traffic signs, Liston said. 
</P>
<P>
When the car neared several schools that were letting out, a police car rammed 
the Blazer to push it out of the path of pedestrians and stop it, authorities 
said.

JUMPING FOR JOY AGAIN;

<P>
BASKETBALL BURDENS OF FEBRUARY BEHIND, JEROME PRICE IS GOING TO ANY LENGTHS IN 
TRACK

<P>
A strong wind blows to the east at the University City High School track. 
Jerome Price is enjoying the predicament of his friend and teammate, Anthony 
Hill, who is attempting to spray white paint on a rather weathered long jump 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Hill sprays. The paint blows away. Price smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Turn around," Price suggests. 
</P>
<P>
"Turn around?" says Hill with a how-could-you-be-so-silly? tone in his voice. 
"That's downwind, stupid. It'll get all over me." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Price grabs the spray can and announces he is going to paint Hill's 
shoes, make them look new. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have socks on," Hill says. "If you get paint on my toes, I'm going to 
hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Fun and games. Life is a kick again for Jerome Price. A barrel of chuckles and 
a heaping spoonful of jokes. That's the way it has usually been for Price, who 
has had a full year's worth of success in basketball and track. He has set a 
few standards, including the best long jump mark in the state this year of 
24-feet-4 3/4 at the Arcadia Invitational April 11. He won the county's slam 
dunk contest. And he flirts with lots of pretty girls. 
</P>
<P>
So February is all but forgotten. That was the month Price was removed from his 
carefree life as a high school junior. To Price, the shortest month seemed 
endless. 
</P>
<P>
Price, 17, was caught in the middle of an adult game in the courts that 
interfered with his favorite game on the courts. 
</P>
<P>
He was declared ineligible for high school basketball by Kendall Webb, San 
Diego Section commissioner, for participating in the Gus Macker three-on-three 
tournament at the end of January. Days later, urged by community boosters and 
his coaches, Price, the team's leading scorer, challenged the ruling in court 
and eventually won a victory of sorts when a temporary restraining order was 
granted against the California Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
He was thus allowed to return to the University City team, but neither it nor 
Price was ever quite the same. The day he was ruled ineligible was firmly 
stamped in the memories of nearly everyone on campus. The principal, Mary 
McNaughton, was in tears when she broke the news to Tom Medigovich, the boys' 
basketball coach. McNaughton, Medigovich said, has always been extremely 
supportive of Price's athletic career. She even bought him a dress shirt he 
could wear with his tie, a tradition at University City on game days. 
</P>
<P>
The jaws of Price's 12 teammates dropped to the floor when Medigovich told them 
Price could no longer play. Their spirit dropped at the same time. Without the 
heart of the offense, University City lost to Clairemont that night. 
</P>
<P>
Price's reaction? Suddenly things were complicated, not fun. He didn't 
understand. Nobody made him aware of the rule. His friend and basketball 
teammate, Darnes Taylor, who says he is like an older brother to Price, met him 
after school that day. Price looked at him and started crying. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time I've seen him take something seriously," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe because this was the first time he needed to be really serious. 
Basketball and sports in general had always been simple enough; smooth, the way 
Price glides through the air to the basket. Laughs, even during the game, were 
frequent. 
</P>
<P>
But this was something new. Unlike basketball or school, Price had no control 
over the outcome. It was left up to an attorney and a judge who, while Price 
was in class, determined whether he would play another basketball game that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Price lives with his grandmother, Myrtle Johnson. She says there were coaches 
who were calling Price a crybaby for challenging the system. The same coaches, 
she says, urged him to attend their school to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
During games before the Valentine's Day hearing, Price waited and watched from 
the stands. He could clearly see his teammates had lost their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like it was over for them," Price said. "They didn't want to push 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
When Price returned, he wasn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I sat out those games, my shot was off," he said. "I was forcing it." 
</P>
<P>
University City was eliminated from the first round of the section playoffs by 
Grossmont. Price has no doubt the season's end would have been sweeter if not 
for his suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have done a lot better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weeks since basketball season, and Price's continually improving long jump, 
have helped ease some of the sour memories of a month he would just as soon 
forget. Price talks of jumping even farther, though his mark at Arcadia already 
topped his previous best (23-6) by nearly a foot. He plans to try out for 
football next season. That, of course, is pending approval from his 
grandmother, who doesn't want to see him get hurt. "I'll think about it," she 
said. "I'm protective." 
</P>
<P>
With good reason. Price is as good an all-around athlete as can be found in San 
Diego. Colleges are drooling over his potential in track. Minnesota, Nevada 
Reno and Kansas have sent letters. 
</P>
<P>
Price's staples are the long jump, high jump, 400 relay and 1,600 relay. In the 
high jump, says University City track Coach Nick Ciaccio, Price, who is 6-1, 
can clear 6-feet with barely a running start. Ciaccio's biggest problem is the 
rule book, which states an athlete can only participate in four events. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of those guys you'd like to put in six or seven," Ciaccio says. 
</P>
<P>
None of Price's athletic accomplishments are the least bit surprising. Ask 
Anthony Hill, the painter. He says he used to be the fastest kid at Kennedy 
Elementary School. Then Price came in sixth grade and beat him in the 50-yard 
dash while wearing penny loafers. Teammates are continually amazed at what 
Price can do on the basketball court. Hill played in a recent three-on-three 
tournament and said Price consistently outrebounded a player who was 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor likes to recall University City's victory over Mission Bay. Price told 
him just before the tipoff at the beginning of overtime that he was going to 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the tip," Taylor says, "and he flew." 
</P>
<P>
Price scored eight consecutive points. Taylor was situated underneath the 
basket on one play when Price went flying past, far overhead, for a crunching 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing there saying 'Wow, I wish I could do that,' " Taylor says, 
looking toward the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The dunks and the jumps have made Price somewhat of a campus hero. Everybody 
likes to be around him. There may be more to it than just admiration of his 
athletic talent. Those who hang out with him say he's fun to be around. His 
grandmother says the house is very quiet until he comes home from school. Then, 
everybody is laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attention, Price appears to have his priorities in order. John 
Hutsel, an assistant track coach at University City, says Price works as hard 
in school as he does on the track. Still, it is evident that while Price is 
taking on more and more adult responsibilities, he'd just as soon be a kid for 
a while longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Face" is his nickname. Jerome, as Taylor says, just doesn't sound right. Even 
his grandmother calls him "Face." "We call him Jerome in public sometimes," she 
says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The origin of the nickname? It came about when he was a baby and his mom would 
sit him on the couch. Apparently, Jerome always fell on his face. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened for a long time. 
</P>

BATTERED KAYPRO REPORTS A PROFIT FOR 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Faulting "bad press" for its slumping sales, Kaypro Corp. on Wednesday managed 
to report a second-quarter profit thanks to the partial recovery of a debt that 
it previously thought was uncollectible. 
</P>
<P>
The Solana Beach personal computer manufacturer's net income for the quarter 
ended Feb. 28 was $731,538, contrasted with a loss of $2.2 million for the same 
period last year. The profit reflects the receipt of a $1-million promissory 
note booked as extraordinary income from Stars to Go, a value-added reseller of 
Kaypro computers. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro's second-quarter sales dropped 68%, to $6.3 million from $19.5 million 
reported for the same quarter the previous year. At Kaypro's annual 
shareholders' meeting here Wednesday, Kaypro executives blamed the results on 
unfavorable publicity in recent months that he said has driven away substantial 
numbers of potential Kaypro customers. 
</P>
<P>
"From reading the papers, people would wonder whether we were going to be 
around to service their machines," Kaypro Chairman Andrew Kay told shareholders 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders at the annual meeting Wednesday offered Kay several suggestions on 
how to improve Kaypro's declining fortunes, from declaring bankruptcy and 
signing up celebrities to promote the company to "bundling" Kaypro products 
with free stock certificates as incentives to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro stock closed unchanged at $.25 a share in over-the-counter trading 
Wednesday. At its initial public stock offering in 1983, Kaypro sold shares at 
$10 each. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity management referred to has centered on Kaypro's problems with 
lender Commonwealth Financial Corp., which last year called a $6-million loan 
due. As Kaypro scrambled to pay off, Commonwealth took control of Kaypro's 
inventory and receivables, even "stamping Kaypro invoices with instructions to 
send payments" to Commonwealth, Kaypro said in filings with regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro finally paid Commonwealth off in March with proceeds from a 
sale-leaseback transaction, involving Kaypro's headquarters and manufacturing 
facility in Solana Beach. The company has also persuaded several creditors to 
extend terms on overdue accounts payable in recent weeks, causing significant 
improvement in Kaypro's working capital. 
</P>
<P>
But the Commonwealth loan problem and the debt restructuring have underscored 
Kaypro's continuing cash problems. Those problems have forced Kaypro to borrow 
$7.2 million from Kay over the last two years to pay its bills, a sum that 
includes a $2-million note taken back by Kay to complete the sale-leaseback. 
</P>
<P>
As Kaypro now has no banking relationship, Kay said he will continue to supply 
Kaypro with cash as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro's "bad press" has also focused on the company's $37 million in 
accumulated losses over the last five years, which prompted the company's 
auditors last year to express "substantial doubt" about Kaypro's ability to 
continue as a going concern. 
</P>
<P>
Mention has also been made in news accounts of Kaypro's steadily falling stock 
price and the fact that Kaypro has discontinued several product lines and 
development programs, resulting in significant write-offs over the past two 
years. Moreover, Kaypro has instituted deep job cuts in recent months: 
Employees now total 150, down from 526 as of Oct. 30, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When Stars to Go failed to pay for $2 million worth of Kaypro computers in 
1987, Kaypro wrote off the debt as uncollectible. On Wednesday, Kay said the 
improved financial condition of Stars to Go prompted Kaypro to take back the 
note, plus 1 million shares of Stars to Go stock as settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Margins on sales of Kaypro's machines have improved over the last year, Kay 
said, in part because the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 
semiconductors, the "building blocks" of a computer's built-in memory capacity, 
have decreased in price to about $4.50 for one megabit of data storage, from 
$11.50 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended Feb. 28, Kaypro reported a net loss of $173,389 on 
sales of $15.6 million, contrasted with a loss of $2.8 million on sales of $42 
million for the same two quarters the previous year.

YUBA INVESTOR CONSIDERS SUIT OVER FAILURE TO SHIFT ASSESTS 
</P>

A Vancouver shareholder in a Canadian subsidiary of Yuba Natural Resources said 
Wednesday he is organizing fellow investors and may consider taking legal 
action against Yuba because a planned transfer of certain assets to the 
subsidiary from Yuba has not yet occurred, jeopardizing the value of his stock. 
</P>
<P>
Yuba also disclosed that it is negotiating with Bank of America to come up with 
a new loan agreement to replace the existing one, under which Yuba defaulted on 
a $5-million payment. According to Yuba's most recent filing with federal 
regulators, the payment was due April 3. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed with the state Department of Corporations show that the Bank of 
America loan is secured by Yuba's one-third interest in Yuba Placer Gold, a 
joint venture with Bond International Gold. Yuba 9,900-acre mining area 10 
miles east of Marysville is also the site of silica and aggregate mining. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Friedland of Vancouver said through a spokesman Wednesday that he, his 
parents and several other international investors bought Yuba American Gold 
Ltd. stock in a $4.485-million private placement in late 1987 in anticipation 
of the asset transfer from Yuba Natural Resources. Yuba American Gold stock was 
ultimately to have become publicly traded on Canadian exchanges, Yuba Natural 
Resources has said. 
</P>
<P>
Without offering an explanation, a Yuba Natural Resources spokesman said 
Wednesday that the transfer of certain company mining assets to Yuba American 
Gold has been initiated and was to have been completed by now but has been 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Yuba Natural Resources filed a deed and grant of rights last Nov. 30 with the 
Yuba County recorder's office that seemed to transfer at least certain rights 
to the Yuba American Gold entity. 
</P>
<P>
The deed and grant of rights, signed by Yuba Natural Resources Chairman Richard 
Silberman, called for the company to "sell, grant and convey . . . all gold, 
silver, mercury" and other rights to mine precious metals on Yuba property to 
Yuba American Gold. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was arrested April 7 and later charged with attempting to launder 
funds he thought came from Colombian cocaine traffickers but which actually 
came from a federal undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
One of the laundering transactions Silberman is charged with involved the 
exchange of Yuba American Gold stock for cash, according to an affidavit filed 
by federal authorities in support of Silberman's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also contained passages from a wiretapped conversation in which 
Silberman allegedly instructed a Yuba Natural Resources executive to send 
Friedland a Yuba American Gold shareholder list that excluded some shareholder 
names, including those of "Arokana," the name under which the federal agent's 
Yuba American Gold shares were listed.

 DH Technology, a manufacturer of computer print heads, reported a 
first-quarter profit of $1.2 million on sales of $9.5 million, up from a profit 
of $175,000 on sales of $3 million for the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
DH Technology attributed the improvements to increased shipments of its 
products and to the inclusion of results from its acquisition last year of 
Eaton Printer products, since renamed DHPrint.

THE WEDDING SONG;

<P>
BANDS FIND A REWARDING NICHE PROVIDING MAGIC MOMENTS AT RECEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Heather Warnick stood on the small stage at the Calabasas Inn, under a metal 
chandelier shaped like an exotic plant. A band composed of four tuxedoed 
musicians, poised to play guitar, bass, keyboards and drums, stood behind her. 
</P>
<P>
As a little girl, Warnick dreamed of being a singer with a band much like this 
one. She wanted to dress up and perform before crowds, singing pop music. 
</P>
<P>
She has gotten her wish. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen! I've just received word that our bride and groom have 
arrived at the Calabasas Inn!" she announced into a hand-held microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Warnick is the leader of one of the San Fernando Valley's most successful 
wedding bands. 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone in the room to start cheering for them as loudly as they can," 
she told the crowd of about 100 as the big moment neared. The crowd began to 
applaud politely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couple's Entrance 
</P>
<P>
"They can't hear you!" Warnick scolded, and the crowd got livelier. Then, as 
the just-married couple shyly stuck their heads through the door, Warnick 
joyfully announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, may I present, for the very first 
time, our bride and groom: Karen and Kurt Linden! All right!" 
</P>
<P>
Just as Warnick had instructed them to do, the newlyweds entered and made their 
way to the dance floor, stopping several times to greet friends and relatives. 
The band, known as the Music Connection, broke into "I Had the Time of My Life" 
from the movie "Dirty Dancing," and Warnick began singing. 
</P>
<P>
There was almost an audible sigh from the crowd as the couple began their first 
dance as husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its ability to manufacture moments like these, the Music Connection 
is in high demand, playing up to four events a weekend. A pride in what they do 
and their success soothes whatever resentment might be generated by not playing 
more glamorous events. 
</P>
<P>
Like actors who end up on soap operas, poets who do greeting cards or baseball 
players who never go beyond Triple-A, the musicians in wedding bands have not 
achieved their dreams. But they are, nonetheless, often skilled performers who 
derive great satisfaction from their achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a professional, and I am proud of what I do," said David Gallagher, leader 
of Sunswept, another popular wedding band based in the Valley. "That's more 
than a lot of people in music can say." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher, 33, had so many rock 'n' roll bands when he was a teen-ager in 
Buffalo, N.Y., that he can't remember the name of his first. 
</P>
<P>
"We were Shining Star for a while, Crystal Blue, the Loners -- it changed all 
the time," he said, sitting in the living room of his home in Van Nuys, where 
he meets prospective customers. "But we were always playing a mixture of the 
Stones and Led Zeppelin and the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher and his various bands played school dances until he and the other 
musicians turned 16, when they switched to nightclubs and bars. He played his 
first wedding when he was 18. "I think we got $50," Gallagher, a drummer, said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Gallagher developed an interest in jazz, which worked well 
for weddings. "Back in the 1960s and into the '70s, weddings meant doing jazz 
standards almost all night. Lots of 'Misty,' 'Satin Doll,' 'In the Mood' and 
'Girl From Ipanema.' We might do a twist number or something like 'Proud Mary' 
for the one big rock 'n' roll number for the night." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher moved to Los Angeles in 1982 in hopes of finding steady work as a 
studio musician. To avoid "doing the waiter" bit while he was working toward 
his dream, he put together a band to play at weddings, Christmas parties, bar 
mitzvahs, corporate events and all the other occasions that musicians call 
"casuals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Pay 
</P>
<P>
The casuals eventually came to take up more and more of his time. "I think what 
happened to me is that I turned 30," Gallagher said. "I suddenly wanted a 
steady paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Sunswept plays two to four weddings or other casuals on most weekends and 
charges about $1,000 per event. To supplement his income, Gallagher acts as an 
agent for several other wedding bands. When prospective clients come to his 
house, he can show them videos of Sunswept and a variety of ensembles ranging 
from classical to mariachi. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gallagher, George Banfalvi started his career playing dances. He started 
the Music Connection in 1976 while he was a student at Birmingham High School 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
A year after the band formed, it won second place at a citywide "Battle of the 
Bands" at the Hollywood Bowl. After that came a few club dates, some parties 
and, finally, weddings. Three years later, when the Music Connection was 
playing more and more casuals, Banfalvi went looking for a female singer to 
join the all-male ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a lot more versatility for the kinds of occasions we were 
playing," said Banfalvi, 30, who plays bass. His Northridge home is the 
headquarters for the group, which rehearses there once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"With a female singer, you can do love duets. It's definitely a better 
marketing aspect for a band." 
</P>
<P>
Warnick, who had worked free-lance with several bands as a singer, was ready to 
settle down with one steadily working group. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the illusions of grandeur that every young singer has -- cut a record, 
Vegas," she said. "Maybe I didn't get to do that, but I have a family and I 
wanted a 
</P>
<P>
job where I didn't have to go on the road for weeks at a time. I didn't want to 
be out seven nights a week at a club." 
</P>
<P>
She and Banfalvi became partners, and she took over many of the business and 
organizational aspects of the Music Connection. She meets with couples and 
discusses costs, which total about $1,500 for a standard four hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in music, I love what I do, we're good at it, we work hard and we're 
successful," Warnick said. "Who could fight with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the band's bookings are a result of being seen at various functions, 
Warnick said, and the group is already booked for some bar mitzvahs in 1991. 
Band members have not had a free weekend, other than vacations, for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Goals 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the Music Connection said they love their work, although 
they hope to eventually move on to other musical endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Paul Trudeau, 28, has started to get some studio work. Most 
recently, Trudeau, who lives in North Hollywood, played on a series of jingles 
produced for a Japanese radio program. Drummer Michael Cassam, 31, of Calabasas 
would like to work on pop albums, tour with a pop band and eventually become a 
recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
Lead guitarist Wayne Milligan, 36, of Simi Valley also had a violin with him at 
the wedding reception. Before any of the guests came into the room, he warmed 
up by playing a Bach partita. 
</P>
<P>
"Classical music is where I want to be, where I will be in a couple years," he 
said with a broad smile. He has studied violin since he was 21 and hopes to 
join a symphony. "In the meantime, playing with a band like this on weekends 
keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
The Music Connection plays soft rock, contemporary dance music and oldies -- 
the standard repertoire for most wedding bands -- almost exclusively. So does 
Sunswept. "The days of the Big Band, jazz sound for weddings is practically 
over," Gallagher said. "The contemporary wedding band now is actually a rock 
'n' roll band that can do a few standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll has been around so long that almost everyone responds to it," 
Gallagher said. "They love the dance oldies, the Motown. Once we get into 
'Louie, Louie' or 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine,' that's usually it for the 
night. The party is off and running." 
</P>
<P>
"It's our job to make the party," Warnick said. "I like to get them up there 
dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why, shortly after the festivities began at the Calabasas Inn, Warnick 
began to worry about the Linden party. One of her well-practiced techniques is 
to segue immediately from the first dance -- a slow number that traditionally 
ends with almost everyone on the floor -- into a fast number. "While I've got 
them all up there, I like to sneak in something fast to let them know it's 
going to be a fun party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tough Crowd 
</P>
<P>
As soon as "Time of My Life" ended, Warnick quickly called for a spirited Kool 
and the Gang song, "Celebrate." But most of the guests, even the young couples, 
walked off the dance floor and returned to their seats for polite conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"This sometimes happens at an afternoon party," Warnick said during the band's 
first break. "But I have some tricks I can use." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, please join us in what we call 'Karen and Kurt's Love Circle,' " she 
announced after the salad course. "We need everyone up here in a big circle. 
We'll give you a minute or so to make your way up here." 
</P>
<P>
No one moved. Warnick looked a tiny bit desperate. "Let's do it for Karen and 
Kurt," she said as the band started playing an instrumental version of "That's 
What Friends Are For." 
</P>
<P>
"A big circle," she said with a smile. "Right here." 
</P>
<P>
Still nothing. Warnick grabbed the wireless mike and jumped off the little 
stage, heading for the nearest table. "I'm going to invite this table to be the 
very first ones up to start the love circle! Thank you! I promise it won't 
hurt." No movement, but she quickly moved on to the next table, working the 
room for all it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
After more pleas, a few guests began to move tentatively. Warnick capitalized 
on their movement to get almost everyone started toward the dance floor. She 
asked everyone to hold hands while the bride and groom danced in the middle of 
the circle. 
</P>
<P>
Guests swayed to the music as Warnick sang the song about warmth and 
friendship. Then, as soon as the number was over, the band broke into "La 
Bamba," one of the sure-fire dance songs of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a handful of couples, everyone drifted back to their tables. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say I didn't try," Warnick said with a laugh during the next break. 
"Sometimes the tricks just don't work." 
</P>
<P>
The guests at the Linden reception seemed happy to simply eat and politely 
visit with one another as the band played the rest of its four-hour engagement. 
With the exception of a few preteens and an irrepressible 18-month-old who hit 
the dance floor often, it was a distinctly laid-back wedding party. The Music 
Connection resigned itself to providing background music with "Rocket Man," 
"Lean on Me," "The Wind Beneath My Wings" and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Warnick would rather have had the crowd up and dancing -- the Music 
Connection's reputation was built on generating a lively atmosphere. But she 
recognizes that her first priority is to size up the crowd and give them what 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the afternoon party, Warnick sang "The Wind Beneath My Wings" 
from the movie "Beaches" for the second time by request. Most guests had left 
by then, although several had stopped on the way out to pick up one of the 
band's cards from a discreet holder on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the band began to pack up, the bride approached them.

TECHNOLOGY TURNS TEENS INTO TOTAL PHONE FREAKS

Monique Polizzi, 16, talks to girlfriends on a private telephone line. When 
she's in a hurry, she pushes a button for speed dialing; when she is getting 
dressed, she uses the speaker phone. 
</P>
<P>
But Polizzi's mother drew the line at call waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't want me to get it because she was afraid I'd be on the phone 
constantly. So I just called the phone company myself and got it." 
</P>
<P>
Polizzi, a junior at Chatsworth High School, was eventually caught using the 
forbidden service. But although she said her mother wanted her to pick up the 
tab for speed dialing, "I never ended up paying for it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm constantly on the phone," Polizzi admitted. But "I've learned to talk 
and do homework at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Hogs 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers are notorious telephone hogs, and with today's technology -- 
separate phone lines, call waiting, call forwarding, speed dialing, three-way 
calling, speaker phones, cordless phones, car phones and, of course, answering 
machines -- they never have to miss a word. Even the parents who pay -- or at 
least approve of -- all this technology seem to feel that hours of telephone 
time are an inevitable part of the growing-up process. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I get really frustrated," said Jeri Shipp, the mother of Stephanie 
Shipp, a 17-year-old senior at North Hollywood High. "I'd say, 'Can you get off 
the phone so we can eat dinner?' I'd just put everything on a plate and leave 
it there, and when I'd come back half an hour later, it'd be untouched. She'd 
still be on the phone. It's frustrating, but I remember what it was like. I did 
the same thing, so it's hard to get mad." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank psychologist Mark Imhoff says teen-agers talk on the phone all the time 
"because of their changing focus of their libidos from the family to the peer 
group. The family isn't as psychologically significant as the peer group now 
is. They're trying to find out who they are, what their identity is, where they 
fit into the peer group. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids who don't go through this normal pathology of talking on the phone a 
lot are the ones in the high-risk groups," Imhoff said. "They're not going 
through what they need to go through as teen-agers, the whole identity issue. 
Those are the teen-agers we kind of raise our eyebrows about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'6 People on the Phone' 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff probably wouldn't raise his eyebrows over 17-year-old Jenny Carpenter, a 
senior at Chatsworth High School. Carpenter has her own line, call waiting, 
three-way calling, speed dialing, a speaker phone and a cordless phone. "When 
I'm on the phone with a friend, we can talk to another friend. But lots of my 
friends have the triple line too, so, at times, you can have up to six people 
on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the many phone services that are available, retailers report 
that teen-agers are concerned about style -- and cordless and transparent, 
neon-lined phones are the big winners. 
</P>
<P>
"They love the cordless phone," said George Iglesias, manager of Future Tronics 
in Northridge, where cordless phones sell for between $199.95 and $239.95. "The 
cordless phone looks like a cellular phone. It always stands up, has a rubber 
antenna. Teen-agers like that high-tech 'space' look." 
</P>
<P>
The transparent, neon phone is less expensive at $49, and Iglesias said he 
sells about 25% of his stock to teen-agers. "Teen-agers say that phone is rad," 
he said. "Boyfriends and girlfriends buy them for each other." And both phones 
are considered status symbols. "You see the junior high kids walking around 
with pride, saying, 'Oh, man, I'm going to get that phone.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
45 Cents Per Minute 
</P>
<P>
The telephone obsession extends to the car, where expenses mount up quickly. 
Circuit City, for example, charges $400 on average to install a car phone, 
after which L.A. Cellular will bill customers $45 a month plus 45 cents per 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
Shana Dishell, a 17-year-old senior at the private Buckley School in Sherman 
Oaks, has had a car phone since her 16th birthday. "I'm only supposed to use it 
for emergencies," Dishell said. "Like to call my mother if I'm driving to a 
friend's house, or to call the barn where I'm going to be horseback riding. 
But," she giggled, "I also use it to call friends." 
</P>
<P>
"The car phone was for our peace of mind," said her mother, Marilyn. "With her 
driving, and this crazy world today and the shootings on the freeway, I was 
very nervous. I wanted her to be able to dial 911." 
</P>
<P>
Luka Pecel of Studio City, another 17-year-old senior at Buckley School, said 
there's a car phone in his future. "My mom wants me to get it because she wants 
to keep track of where I am." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Shipp thinks that her parents will get her a car phone when she goes 
to college next year. "If I go to USC, they might want me to have a car phone 
to see if I'm OK, or to say, 'Can you pick up the milk on the way over?' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An employee at Circuit City in Woodland Hills confirmed that parental concern 
is the main reason teen-age drivers acquire car phones. In a typical month, he 
will sell 23 phones, and about one-third are purchased for teen-agers. 
"Typically, it's middle-class parents coming in and getting the car phone for 
their kid's safety. They usually buy a simple, bottom-of-the-line car phone for 
birthday or graduation or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Since almost all of the students interviewed have their own private phone 
lines, what was it like when their families had to share one line? 
</P>
<P>
"In our house, we have one upstairs bedroom," said 15-year-old Kristen Strong, 
a 10th-grader at Chatsworth High. "I talk on the phone all the time. My parents 
could never get any calls. My brother couldn't either. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom didn't want me to have my own line," said Strong, who indeed has her 
own line, call waiting and three-way calling. "She just thought I shouldn't be 
talking on the phone that much anyway. She objected to the whole thing. So my 
dad pays for it. I've had it since the seventh grade. I used to get in trouble 
a lot for it -- I'd say, 'OK, I'm off the phone,' then I'd stay on the phone, 
but whisper so my mom couldn't hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Missy Pecel, Luka's 14-year-old sister -- and an eighth grader at Buckley 
School -- talks on the phone for three hours a night. She doesn't have her own 
line or any of its frills -- yet. "In a few months, I'm going to get one," she 
said. "Luka got his first, I guess, because he's older." 
</P>
<P>
Missy remembers the fights that used to break out when she and her brother had 
to share the same line. "He'd always want to talk to girls, and I'd want to 
talk to my friends," she said. "He'd get mad when I'd pick up the phone and 
listen, but I'm interested in his conversations. I like to hear what he says to 
girls and stuff, to see where he's ranked in his grade, how popular he is." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Luka has his own private line, Missy's solved the dilemma of not being 
able to eavesdrop. "I just sit outside his door and listen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Polizzi decided to get her daughter her own line because "Monique has 
abundant energy. With her on the phone in her room, she keeps it centralized -- 
the whole house isn't 16." 
</P>
<P>
"I really think it's a waste of her time," she added. "But I'd rather she do 
that than watch TV. It's the lesser of the two evils. At least I know where she 
is when she's on the phone. She's in my home, rather than someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Shipp says Stephanie has had her own telephone since she was 12 years old. 
"I couldn't stand sharing it with her. Two females in one house with one phone 
doesn't work. We were always fighting over it. I do mind paying her bill (about 
$40 a month) but she's real good about it. When she made some new friends in 
different areas, it went sky high. I tell her to watch it, but then she'll go 
use my phone."

'THE TRIARCHIC MIND'; 
</P>
<P>
YALE PSYCHOLOGIST DEFINES THREE TYPES OF INTELLIGENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE COURTNEY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember sitting in class and noticing how Alice up front always raised her 
hand, always knew the right answer? Remember thinking that in some undefined 
way you were better than she was: maybe more human, maybe more street-smart, or 
at least better at knock hockey? 
</P>
<P>
You may have been right, says Robert S. Sternberg, a Yale University 
psychologist whose recent book, "The Triarchic Mind: A New Theory of Human 
Intelligence" (Viking, $19.95), explains why. The book defines and analyzes 
three kinds of intelligence -- internal (such as Alice's), the creative 
experiential type and the street-smart contextual variety -- saying that 
Alice's kind is only part of the story and doesn't mean a lot for her future 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg's field is cognitive science, a discipline made up of researchers in 
psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and 
the neurosciences. These people, he says, "are trying to figure out what goes 
on in our heads when we bring our intelligence to bear on a problem." 
Sternberg, 39, has been fascinated by intelligence tests since his childhood, 
when he did terribly on them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IQ Tests Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s people have criticized IQ tests as being too bound by white 
Western culture and as neglecting certain kinds of achievement. But that wasn't 
enough for Sternberg, who seems to revel in turning experience into an analyzed 
quantity. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg's early frustration with intelligence tests led him to a 
seventh-grade science project on intelligence testing. In graduate school in 
the 1970s, he wrote a Barron's guide, "How To Prepare for the Miller Analogy 
Test," which kept him thinking about the steps people go through in using their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
Analogy tests ask for the answer to problems such as "stubborn is to mule as 
fickle is to: (a) chameleon (b) salamander (c) tadpole (d) frog." Whether you 
answer the question quickly or slowly, the way you answer it is complex. 
</P>
<P>
First, you translate the problem into a mental representation: Stubbornness is 
a quality; a mule and the reptiles and amphibians listed are animals with 
various characteristics. Then you think about the relationship between the 
first term and the second -- mules are often considered stubborn, so much so 
that they are metaphors for stubbornness. 
</P>
<P>
You relate the two halves of the analogy: If mules are metaphors for 
stubbornness, what is a metaphor for fickleness? Finally, you must apply the 
relationships and give an answer: Fickleness is constant change. Tadpoles 
change into frogs, but both "tadpoles" and "frogs" are answers, so they can't 
be right; anyway, a tadpole changes only once. But chameleons change color all 
the time. And you probably know that they have been used as a metaphor for 
fickleness. There's the answer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thinking Components 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg eventually broke down the components of such question-answering and 
gave the parts names: 
</P>
<P>
There are "metacomponents" -- the executive functions that boss the other 
intelligence functions around. Examples of these are recognizing the existence 
of a problem, defining its nature and generating the set of steps necessary to 
solve it. 
</P>
<P>
There are the "performance components" that take those steps, using such 
processes as inference, the discovery of relationships between objects and 
events. 
</P>
<P>
And along the way, you might have had to pick up some new knowledge -- such as 
what a chameleon is -- and had to use "knowledge-acquisition components." 
</P>
<P>
As his career as a professor progressed, he got to know many graduate students 
in psychology. He got together with them to do studies and tests of their 
achievements as related to their test scores, and learned surprising things. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near-Perfect Record 
</P>
<P>
First, your old classmate Alice ended up in his classes. She had fulfilled the 
obvious promise she had shown in the days when you envied her. She had a 
near-perfect record and had no trouble getting into Yale. Her grades were high 
for the first 2 years of graduate school, but then something happened. They 
slipped, around the time she had to start putting things together herself -- to 
do some creative original research. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Barbara, an admissions officer's long shot. She didn't have the 
kind of grades or test scores that made Yale salivate -- but she did have some 
glowing recommendations and some unusual original research. When grad school 
became less academic and more improvisational, she excelled. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Celia, somewhere in between the first two academically. But 
Celia was good at scoping out what was expected of her and using it. She could 
take her new surroundings and know whether to adapt to them, change them or 
quit, and she probably had no trouble writing grant applications after 
graduating. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg uses the three graduate students -- real people to whom he gave fake 
names -- as analogies of what he means by a triarchic theory of intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Alice's intelligence he calls "internal" and is the kind usually measured by 
intelligence tests. He calls Barbara's creative powers "experiential" 
intelligence. Celia's street smarts represent "contextual" intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
In dozens of papers, articles in professional and popular journals, and 
seminars, Sternberg is trying to influence the world of testing to take the 
second two kinds of intelligence into account. He is working with the 
Psychological Corp. to develop a Sternberg Multidimensional Abilities Test -- a 
test measuring all three kinds of intelligence -- by 1992. He believes strongly 
that all three kinds of intelligence can be taught -- that it is possible to, 
as he says, "get smart." 
</P>
<P>
To Pascal Forgione, the chief of the Office of Research and Evaluation at the 
Connecticut Department of Education, Sternberg's theory is in the democratic 
spirit. Forgione's office studies ways to improve the tests given 
schoolchildren in the state. Much of the debate has regarded intelligence 
itself as a cast-in-concrete, given quantity, and debated such issues as 
whether it is dependent on heredity or environment. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional ways of looking at intelligence "didn't get at the process of 
learning," Forgione says. "IQ tests were bad indicators of later success. 
Sternberg's idea is that the components of intelligence are teachable -- that 
if a student doesn't do well, it's not genetically going to be that way . . . 
Sternberg takes us beyond." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is enthralled with Sternberg's theories. The book, touting 
"mental self-management," contains injunctions such as "turn crisis into 
opportunities" that bother a British cognitive scientist, Philip N. 
Johnson-Laird. "Some of his advice is merely an elegant variation on the 
vacuous exhortation: Be intelligent," Johnson-Laird wrote in a New York Times 
book review of "The Triarchic Mind."

RESEARCH MAKES A CASE AGAINST JOINT CUSTODY FOR SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Kim, a young woman in Southern California, decided to have a baby, she 
assumed that the child would be hers to bring up as she pleased. After all, she 
was not married to the baby's father, and by the time the baby was born she and 
her boyfriend had irrevocably parted. 
</P>
<P>
But her boyfriend thought otherwise, and the courts agreed. To Kim's dismay, 
the baby's father was awarded joint physical custody -- the baby boy must spend 
part of each week with his father and part with his mother. Kim has a stormy 
and bitter relationship with her former boyfriend. She said she fears for her 
baby's emotional well-being if he grows up splitting his time between parents 
who are so angry with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts don't seem to be interested in a child's emotional and physical 
well-being," Kim said. "As the judge put it, he's looking for 'cigarette burns, 
bruises and broken bones.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No One's Best Interest 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Judith Wallerstein, executive director of the Center for the 
Family in Transition in Corte Madera, Calif., emphatically agrees with Kim 
that, in her case, joint physical custody is not in the best interest of 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein and her colleagues have recently completed a study showing that 
joint physical custody is detrimental to children of divorce if their parents 
are warring. Even if the parents have an amicable relationship, joint custody 
has no effect on the emotional health of the children or on how parents adjust 
to the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
These findings on joint custody are based on three recent studies by 
Wallerstein and her colleagues. One experiment at Wallerstein's center looked 
at how children adjust to custody arrangements made voluntarily by parents. The 
researchers studied 101 children from a well-educated, middle-class suburban 
community for two years after their parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In about one-third of the families, the parents had voluntarily selected joint 
custody. From a standard battery of tests and clinical interviews, the 
researchers concluded that joint custody makes no difference in these 
children's psychological well-being. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boys Not Helped 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein was particularly disappointed that such joint-custody families did 
not help boys. Many therapists and social scientists have hoped that boys' 
longing for their fathers could be assuaged by joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
A second experiment, led by Stanford University sociologist Janet Johnston, 
looked at 100 families from mixed social and economic classes who were engaged 
in bitter divorces. One-third of the children were in joint custody and the 
rest in sole custody. The researchers found that joint custody was actually 
worse for the children than sole custody. 
</P>
<P>
Girls, in particular, were hurt by these forced arrangements, Wallenstein said. 
"No longer part of her mother's protective orbit," the girl "loses her value 
and her identity as her mother's psychological extension and close ally and 
becomes instead either the fantasy rival, the fantasy traitor -- tainted by 
contact with the enemy -- or both." As a consequence, the girl "has protection 
nowhere," Wallerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
A third experiment, led by psychologist William Coysh, examined the parents of 
middle-class families to see whether custody arrangements made a difference in 
how parents adjusted to divorce. "One of the most persuasive arguments for 
joint custody has been that fathers feel much better about themselves and are 
better parents when they undertake joint custody of their children," 
Wallerstein said. But she was surprised by the result: Custody arrangements had 
no effect. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein said the findings "are not an argument against joint custody, but 
they also are not an argument that it will benefit the child." 
</P>
<P>
These results may not surprise experts in family studies, but they are 
politically difficult because they could take away from the gains of fathers' 
rights groups, which have argued for joint custody as a major way for fathers 
to have access to their children. Starting in the late 1970s, joint custody 
became an option for the divorce courts in most states. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein's research flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that 
children of divorce do better if they split their time between their parents. 
Not surprisingly, many divorced men have hotly contested her findings. Some 
contend that the study was too small in scope and looked at the parents and 
children for too short a time to be conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Many divorced men think Wallerstein's findings do not bode well for fathers 
seeking custody. If the courts are persuaded that joint physical custody is 
detrimental, they fear, sole custody will go to the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
James Cook, president of the Joint Custody Assn., a group with 3,000 members in 
43 states, said half-jokingly that "a natural extrapolation" of Wallerstein's 
study is that more fathers should get sole custody. But, he added, "I think 
that's not likely in today's society." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointing Findings 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein is disappointed that her findings were not more optimistic. "It 
would be nice to feel that we could cut into a child's unhappiness." Children 
of divorce are often unhappy and troubled, regardless of what sort of custody 
arrangements are in place, Wallerstein said. She said she thinks the focus for 
the children of divorced parents should be on individual relationships with 
each parent, not custody issues. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers think that the most important influence on the emotional health of 
children is the quality of their relationships within their family, however 
that family might be structured, said Robert Emery, a psychologist at the 
University of Virginia. For example, psychologists used to think that boys 
needed their father within the home until at least age 7 or 8. Now they have 
discovered that the physical presence of a father in the family is less 
important to boys than are warm and supporting adults. 
</P>
<P>
This shift occurred "partly in recognition of the changing American family and 
the changing demographics of divorce. It is an appreciation of plurality," 
Emery said. But the focus on relationships also means that if divorced parents 
are angry and bitter, children will suffer and they will suffer more if they're 
exposed more to the conflict through joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the child feels accepted or rejected is very important," Wallerstein 
said. "But custody doesn't convey that. It is a much more subtle, much more 
elusive issue of how the child perceives himself within the family."

Funding Curb 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 209 for and 216 against, the House rejected an amendment to freeze 
spending for the National Endowment for Democracy, blocking a proposed 58% 
budget hike. This left intactlegislation to raise the endowment's $15.8-million 
budget to $25 million next year. The vote occurred as the House sent to the 
Senate a bill authorizing $4.9 billion for the State Department in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment sends federal appropriations to the Republican and Democratic 
parties, the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce, which use the money primarily 
to promote democratic reform around the world. 
</P>
<P>
John Conyers (D-Mich.) said the endowment "has become a pseudo entity of the 
U.S. government . . . often embarrassing our government." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), who opposed the amendment, said, "Anything that advances 
the cause of democracy in places that are inhospitable to democracy . . . is 
money well spent." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to block a 58% spending increase for the National 
Endowment for Democracy.

Contra Aid 
</P>
<P>
The House passed, 309 for and 110 against, a bill putting into effect the new 
Nicaraguan policy of the Bush Administration and the Democratic-led Congress. 
The package includes nearly $50 million in non-military aid to keep the Contra 
rebels assembled in Honduras until it becomes known whether Nicaragua's Marxist 
government will keep its promise to hold elections in February. It could lead 
to the Contras being disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Matthew McHugh (D-N.Y.) said: "This new policy recognizes that the 
Contra war is over." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Dan Burton (R-Ind.) said: "If we don't vote for this package, the 
freedom fighters die now. If we do vote for it, they die in seven months." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the new U.S. policy toward Nicaragua.

Orange County officials have denied fault in a pool accident in which one child 
died and two others suffered severe brain damage at an unlicensed day-care 
center at a North Tustin home. A $10-million claim filed against the county 
asserts that officials did nothing to prevent the March 30 accident and failed 
to follow up on shutdown orders issued to operators of the center. "We followed 
the law," Dianne Edwards, chief of day-care licensing for the county Social 
Services Agency, said. "The responsibility lies with the care providers and 
with the parents whose children were placed there, not with the county." The 
claim was filed by Timothy and Sandra Polsfoot, whose 19-month-old daughter 
remains comatose. Such claims must be filed before a lawsuit can be initiated 
against the county. The Polsfoots have already sued for unspecified damages 
from Orvel and Diana Brooks, who were twice ordered by the county to close the 
center.

U.S. diplomats apparently heeded an official warning and canceled seats on Pan 
Am flights in the weeks before the bombing of Flight 103 last Dec. 21, 
according to airline documents quoted in a congressional memorandum. The House 
Government Operations transportation subcommittee staff memo, obtained by the 
Associated Press, says Pan Am documents indicate that Christmas holiday traffic 
for U.S. Embassy personnel had been heavily re-booked before the bombing over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Relatives of those who died in 
the bombing have been angry that a U.S. warning of a possible bombing of a Pan 
Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany to the United States was not made 
available to the public.

SOVIET OIL-SKIMMING SHIP JOINS CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Soviet ship that can skim oil on the high seas joined the war against the 
United States' worst oil spill, docking in Seward, named for the man who bought 
Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. The 11,400-ton 425-foot-long Vaidogubsky 
steamed 30 miles up fjord-like Resurrection Bay under a cloudy sky, flying the 
Soviet hammer and sickle from its stern and an American flag from its towering 
white superstructure. In Washington, meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Samuel 
K. Skinner told the Senate that industry plans for dealing with an Alaskan oil 
spill had been a "zero" on a scale of one to 10. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), 
chairman of the environmental protection subcommittee, said the response to the 
spill has demonstrated "a complete breakdown" of the procedures that were 
supposed to have been in effect since the federal government approved the 
Alaskan pipeline 16 years ago.

Striking workers and radical students fought police in at least 10 South Korean 
cities, and protesters in Seoul threw a score of firebombs into a U.S. military 
base. Thousands of students hurled rocks and firebombs at police on the 
anniversary of a student uprising April 19, 1960, that brought down the 
authoritarian government of President Syngman Rhee. In Seoul, protesters hurled 
about 20 firebombs into Camp Isabell, a U.S. Army storage facility. American 
military officials reported minor damage. U.S. facilities have been the focus 
of attacks by students pressing for the withdrawal of the 40,000 American 
troops based in South Korea.

Gunmen attacked the first U.N. food convoy carrying famine relief into 
rebel-held areas of southern Sudan and forced it to return to Kenya, a U.N. 
official said. One of the trucks was blown up and two Kenyan drivers were 
wounded when the convoy came under fire near Kapoeta, in southeastern Sudan, 
said Nils Enqvist, the regional coordinator of the U.N. World Food Program for 
East Africa. Enqvist said that a military escort provided by the rebel Sudan 
People's Liberation Army vanished into the bush as soon as the shooting began, 
and the 16-truck convoy turned around and returned to Lokichokio. He said the 
United Nations will have to organize combat insurance for its drivers.

Women in Iran may be punished with up to 74 lashes if they wear makeup or 
see-through stockings in public, the government has warned. A notice by the 
State Security Council published in Iranian newspapers this week said that laws 
punishing violators of hijab, or Islamic covering, will be strictly enforced 
beginning Friday. The notice listed eight types of violations involving the 
face, body and legs. These include exposing the hair in a vulgar way, using 
lipstick and eye-shadow in a provocative manner, wearing clothes that 
accentuate body curves and see-through stockings not covered by trousers. Men 
were also warned that they should not wear "gaudy clothes which are at odds 
with public decency."

Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 23 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip as 
soldiers increased security in the occupied territories and in Israel to 
prevent violence during the seven-day Jewish Passover holiday that started at 
sundown. Violence erupted in four locations in the Gaza Strip, authorities 
said, and 11 of those injured were children. Meanwhile, an opinion survey 
published in the daily Yediot Aharonot newspaper said 65% of Israelis support a 
peace plan by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that calls for Palestinians to 
elect representatives to negotiate autonomy in the occupied territories.

CALCULATING THE REAL COSTS OF THAT HOME EQUITY LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Thinking of getting a home equity loan so you can pay off some of your credit 
card debts, put a new roof on your house, finance an expensive car or send your 
son or daughter to college this fall? 
</P>
<P>
That's not a bad idea, but keep in mind, it's buyer be careful. You better 
check out the company that's offering the loan and know what you're getting: 
Are there fees and points to pay, closing costs, charges for using the credit 
line? What can you deduct from your taxes? Can the variable interest rate 
suddenly change from 12% to 20%? 
</P>
<P>
If you don't know the answers, you may find yourself in a messy situation. If 
you can't make your home equity loan payments, you could lose your house or 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Beneficial Tool' 
</P>
<P>
"A home equity loan can be a beneficial tool to consumers, but they should be 
very careful and know what they're getting or they can get buried by these," 
said Stephen Getzoff, an accountant and financial planner in Beverly Hills. 
"Home equity loans are a tool and they should know how to use one. Would you 
give someone who didn't know anything about real tools a power saw? No. They're 
liable to cut an arm off." 
</P>
<P>
Getzoff and other financial advisers do not recommend taking out such loans 
against your property for "frivolous" reasons, such as a cruise or a new 
wardrobe, or if you only owe a small amount of money on your credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't recommend them for vacations, cars or entertainment spread out over 
30 years," he explained. "But under certain circumstances, for relatively 
short-term needs -- buying a car and paying it off in three or four years -- 
that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Home equity loans have been growing in popularity with homeowners since the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986 began reducing deductions for finance charges, such as those 
for credit cards, costly appliances or car loans. 
</P>
<P>
So taxpayers started looking for other ways of finding deductions, converting 
consumer loans into home equity or other mortgage-related loans. 
</P>
<P>
And the figures uphold the boom in home equity loans. In 1987, for example, 
home equity loans in the United States nearly doubled -- increasing from $40 
billion in 1986 to $72 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, you could deduct only 40% of your consumer interest on your 1988 
tax return; only 20% will be allowed for the 1989 tax year; 10% for 1990, and 
zero thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
You can borrow up to $100,000 on a home equity loan and still write off all the 
interest. But loans secured by real estate can't exceed the fair market value 
of your home. If it's worth less than $100,000 -- unlikely in Southern 
California -- you can only deduct interest on its actual worth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do Some Calculating 
</P>
<P>
If you're considering a home equity loan, sit down with a pad, pencil and 
calculator and figure out your yearly total consumer debt -- credit cards, car 
loans, what appliances you're buying on time. 
</P>
<P>
Say, for instance, if you have $15,000 in consumer debt, you'll probably pay 
about 18.6% interest on it, a total of $2,800 in annual finance charges. You 
can only deduct 20% of those charges, which comes to $560. 
</P>
<P>
If you take out a $15,000 home equity loan at 12%, your interest charges will 
be about $1,800, depending on fees or points you have to pay. Because your loan 
is secured by your property, you can write off all of that. 
</P>
<P>
Lenders are currently offering all sorts of home equity loan "deals," and most 
financial and real estate analysts predict that they will become additionally 
creative with the home equity loan market as the consumer appetite for them 
continues to grow. That creativity may confuse consumers even more. 
</P>
<P>
Observed Nancy Everett, senior vice president and real estate loan expert with 
Great Western Bank: "This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how 
competitive this arena will be." 
</P>
<P>
It's not just tax reform that's causing the home equity phenomenon, Everett 
said. It's also a largely untapped market: total equity in single-family homes 
is estimated to be between $2 trillion and $4 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
"We think in many cases consumers don't really understand home equity loans," 
said Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a San 
Francisco-based watchdog group that conducted a 1988 study on property equity 
loans. "There are very serious questions about a lot of credit approaches, and 
a degree of non-bank direct mail and telemarketing that we have reservations 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"There are dangerous pitfalls and consumers should use great caution. Those 
brochures hyping vacations, yachts and clothing are totally unwarranted. People 
should only get these (home equity loans) for something of significant value." 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney explained that one of the serious problems for consumers seeking 
home equity loans can be that the lenders may unilaterally change the terms of 
the loan, increasing the variable rate because there is no current law that 
mandates they must have a cap on the rate. Or the lending institution may not 
disclose that it can change the index to which it ties the variable rate. 
</P>
<P>
Because of increasing consumer concerns about disclosure and other lack of 
safeguards on home equity loans, Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.) introduced 
national legislation concerning home equity loans last year. Called the Home 
Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act, it passed both the House and the Senate 
and was signed into law in November, but really won't affect today's consumers 
getting such loans. 
</P>
<P>
Because it took longer for the Federal Reserve Board to write the regulations 
for the bill, it is not expected to be fully implemented until late summer or 
early fall, according to a spokeswoman for Price. But she said that some 
lenders are already following the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
What these new rules require is a series of key disclosures to the consumer 
when given the loan application, such as points and fees, and that lenders have 
a cap on the variable loan rate (but it does not limit the amount of the cap). 
They also forbid misleading ads about the price of the loan, and prohibit 
lenders from unilaterally changing the terms of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Some things to look out for when shopping around for a home equity loan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check out the lending institution because some "hard money lenders" like 
finance companies may charge more than banks, savings and loans or stock 
brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure you know upfront what the interest rate is and if it is based on 
the prime rate or some other index like the Treasury bill index often used by 
lenders. What is the cap on the variable rate, and how often can it change? 
That will vary among lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask for a total of all the charges on the loan, including paying points or 
a fee, the appraisal charges or cost of the credit check. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If your home equity loan gives you a credit line, with use of either a 
credit card and/or checking account, will you have to pay a service charge 
every time you use it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask your tax preparer or financial consultant to go over the loan with you 
to make sure what's deductible under the new tax law, or if you'd be better off 
with a straight second mortgage loan on your property, where the interest rate 
is often lower and fixed and still deductible on your taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What is the monthly payment and does it pertain only to interest on the 
loan, requiring a "balloon" payment at the end of the life of the loan? If not, 
what amount each month goes toward the principal of the loan? Is there any kind 
of "grace" period for late payment if you have extenuating circumstances, such 
as illness or job loss? 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you decide to take out the home equity loan, make sure that the lien the 
lending institution places against your home as collateral for the loan is 
registered with the county recorder. This will assure that the money you 
borrowed is mortgage debt and deductible from your income tax.

THE PACK-RAT SYNDROME; 
</P>
<P>
SOME PEOPLE LIVE AND DIE IN GARBAGE-CHOKED HOUSES, AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS WHY 
</P>

<P>
In the 1960s, a middle-aged housewife named Kelton Roberts helped organize 
neighborhood cleanups as a member of Camarillo Beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
But today, officials in this city an hour northwest of Los Angeles say Roberts 
herself is wallowing in filth. Last month, a demolition crew was ordered to 
haul more than 100 tons of festering debris from inside and around her modest 
duplex, which was condemned last summer after inspectors discovered massive 
heaps of trash piled in some rooms to within a foot of the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
When building officials first entered the house -- donning protective overalls, 
rubber boots and breathing masks -- they were forced to slog down narrow aisles 
through stacks of rotting newspapers, magazines, bottles, cans, clothes and 
leaves, all heavy with dust, cobwebs and rodent feces. 
</P>
<P>
The walls had grown mold from rain pouring through the decayed roof. There was 
no plumbing, no gas and no heat. Refuse had almost completely buried the 
bathroom and kitchen fixtures. And Roberts, 64 and widowed, had been literally 
forced by the odor to find shelter in the back yard, where she had equipped 
herself with a tarpaulin, an electric hot plate and a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Possible to Live Inside' 
</P>
<P>
"Nausea and disbelief," was the reaction from Richard Paddock, a Ventura County 
building and safety supervisor, who retired earlier this year. "It wasn't 
possible to live inside, it was so full of trash. I kept wondering how anyone 
could allow themselves to deteriorate into that kind of condition." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout California and around the country, stories like that of Kelton 
Roberts are repeated with surprising regularity. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles alone, officials last year investigated more than 200 cases of 
garbage-choked houses, including four deaths caused by flames erupting from 
rubbish-filled dwellings. Because city inspectors usually don't learn of such 
conditions until a neighbor or landlord complains, it is estimated that 
hundreds, if not thousands, of additional cases go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in psychiatric circles, where obscure maladies frequently fill 
volumes, this phenomenon has scarcely been studied and has no commonly accepted 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe excessive hoarding often is a reaction to fear and 
loneliness. Sometimes, they say, it is caused by mental illness, such as 
obsessive-compulsive or paranoid-schizophrenic disorders. Other times, it might 
be explained by an impoverished childhood or other traumatic loss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profile of a Pack Rat 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that those who live in trash-packed homes are almost always 
elderly, reclusive, distrustful and without friends or nearby family. A few 
exhibit signs of dementia, but many appear lucid and intelligent. Although most 
have middle-class roots, their money is usually stowed away or scattered 
throughout the filth. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, these people's lives are characterized by an exaggerated attachment 
to their belongings, a bond that creates the illusion of abundance where 
otherwise there is a void, say mental health experts. Each item, sometimes even 
urine and used toilet paper, is attributed an unnatural value, until eventually 
refuse has run its collector right out of house and home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like food and drink for these people," said Tom D. Olin, a community 
mental health psychologist at the Arcadia Mental Health Center. "It's as if the 
more one has, the more one feels filled up inside emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Like the sinners in Dante's Inferno who were forced to suffer under the weight 
of their own excesses, so stew the victims of what one psychiatrist calls the 
"pack-rat syndrome." In just the last year, the following cases have come to 
light in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Santa Barbara woman who wore diapers she made from plastic trash bags, 
saving the used ones in the dark garage she called home, along with two dozen 
large soda bottles filled with urine and a cooler so saturated with spoiled 
fruit that worms were oozing through the Styrofoam. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The East Los Angeles woman who collected so much damp, decaying rubbish 
that everything in the first floor of her home turned to black, silty compost. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The downtown Los Angeles man who lived in a junk-filled garage with dozens 
of dogs and cats, as well as several dead ones he had killed in a vain stab at 
veterinary medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Windsor Hills man who died when flames leapt from the layers of trash 
in his two-story home, but whose body could not be found until firefighters 
hauled away more than 50 tons of charred debris. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think it's a character trait -- greed -- taken to its farthest end," 
said Michael Theule, a Los Angeles fire inspector. "They can't pass a trash can 
without taking something off the top. In their minds, they really think they 
can find a use for this junk. They think they're going to get something for 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Mental health experts generally view such hoarding with a bit more sympathy, 
explaining it as a way for the elderly to feel secure at a time when much else 
in their lives has begun to deteriorate. In the same sense that an infant might 
be distraught over flushing the toilet for fear of losing a part of himself, a 
pack rat clings to all belongings for fear of facing mortality ill-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
"The garbage gives them the idea, metaphorically, that they can meet their own 
needs," said Carole Lieberman, the Malibu psychiatrist who coined the term, 
pack-rat syndrome. "As all their powers are beginning to disintegrate, they're 
trying to make sure they will have what they need to take care of themselves, 
to make sure that everything is OK in their own little cocoon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall Out of Touch 
</P>
<P>
As, increasingly, older people may live long distances from their children and 
other family members, some experts fear the problem could become even more 
widespread. The hoarders, they say, are our parents and grandparents, our aunts 
and uncles, with whom we fall out of touch, and who, in turn, fall out of touch 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it may sound simplistic, human beings are social animals and we 
really need somebody who cares," said Lissy Jarvik, a UCLA psychiatrist and 
author of "Parent Care," a guide for adult children. "Accumulating things is 
just a symptom that these people are isolated and lonely." 
</P>
<P>
It is nothing new, of course, for the isolated and lonely to collect junk and 
other oddities. 
</P>
<P>
In his 19th-Century novel, "Great Expectations," Charles Dickens wrote of the 
grim Miss Havisham, an embittered spinster jilted at the altar, who ever after 
wore a yellowed bridal gown, withered flowers and kept a moldy wedding cake in 
a cobweb-filled room. 
</P>
<P>
Silent film star Mary MacLaren, who was romanced on the screen in the 1920s by 
the likes of Rudolph Valentino and Lionel Barrymore, lived her final years in 
two rooms of a once-grand Hollywood house amid trash, animal waste, flies and 
pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eccentric Brothers 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most celebrated such case involved the eccentric Collyer brothers, 
two elderly New Yorkers whose deaths in 1947 made headlines and drew crowds to 
the boarded-up brownstone where they had lived in seclusion for nearly 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The sons of a wealthy Manhattan gynecologist and a domineering mother who read 
the classics aloud in Greek, Langley and Homer Collyer had amassed an 
incredible array of musty newspapers, rancid food, rotting clothes and useless 
junk, all pierced by winding tunnels and guarded by booby traps that would 
crush intruders with a deluge of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Homer, 65, who was blind and paralyzed, was found dead, sitting otherwise naked 
in a tattered bathrobe, after police entered the building on an anonymous tip. 
Officers foraged through the garbage for three weeks before they finally found 
Langley, 61, smothered under the weight of one of his own traps. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the mother might have been the answer since she was the most dominant 
character in the family," wrote journalist Helen Worden Erskine in "Out of This 
World," a 1953 collection of essays about hermits. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the mother who made all the decisions," she wrote. "They lived for her, 
she for them. The tragedy was that by her overpowering devotion she rendered 
helpless the two human beings she loved best. After her death, they were 
utterly without initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Such unpleasant ends happen more often than they should because authorities 
view living conditions, up to a certain point, as essentially private matters. 
</P>
<P>
The garbage, which may be personal refuse or that collected from the streets, 
is frequently hoarded for years by people who have few acquaintances and who 
allow even fewer visitors into their homes. Even if a neighbor or relative 
suspects a problem, say officials, the law allows for a fair amount of filth 
and eccentricity before a public agency may intervene. 
</P>
<P>
"As a mental health professional, I wish the laws were looser so that we could 
intervene before it reached that level," said Larry Wicker, acting chief of the 
Los Angeles County Mental Health Department's Long Beach district. "But the 
laws are very pro-civil rights, often to the exclusion of the kind of humane 
care that a person might need." 
</P>
<P>
That dilemma has served as a backdrop to the year-long fight by Camarillo to 
clean the home of Kelton Roberts, who, now barred from the property, has been 
living on the streets with a shopping cart stacked high with personal effects. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo officials concede they knew of problems at the house as early as 
1980, but say they were not aware of the severity until a flurry of complaints 
from neighbors prompted a more detailed inspection last April. 
</P>
<P>
Although some officials wanted to clear the house with haste, others argued 
that the city should proceed cautiously, giving Roberts a chance to turn over a 
new leaf. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned about her from a humanitarian perspective and wanted to give 
her every chance to comply," said Assistant City Atty. Lisa Kranitz. "We 
weren't going to just show up with a bulldozer and say, 'Hi, we're here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a plump, ruddy-faced woman with a keen wit, attributes some of her 
hoarding to a gypsylike childhood, in which her parents split up during the 
Depression. She followed her mother across Europe and around the U.S. for 
years, living in more than a dozen cities by the time she enrolled in an 
outdoors-oriented private high school in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved all the time and I hated it," she said the other day, as a demolition 
crew scooped the contents of her house into a dumpster. "I wanted roots, but my 
mother had a wanderlust you wouldn't believe." 
</P>
<P>
When Roberts and her husband, Frank, an electronics technician for the Navy, 
bought their one-story duplex in 1954, she believed she finally had a nest 
where she could keep things around as she never could as a child. "I thought I 
had a haven here for the rest of my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Always energetic, Roberts was an outspoken participant at meetings of Camarillo 
Beautiful, as well as the Camarillo City Council, the local school board and 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. She also raised her two children, 
Ronald, now 37 and a part-time land-scaper in Santa Barbara, and Richard, 35, a 
sonar technician in the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
But, in 1967, her husband died suddenly after routine surgery. Not long 
afterward, her sons moved out. And Roberts, who had always kept the place a 
little cluttered, began to lose interest in maintaining order. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that nobody else cared but me," she said, eyes wide behind her 
antique aluminum glasses. "I kind of got the attitude of 'Why bother?' " 
</P>
<P>
That attitude has frustrated Camarillo health and building inspectors, who say 
Roberts has failed to meet every deadline set for cleaning the place up over 
the last year. Even her son Ronald, who was appointed her conservator in 
January, began to lose patience with his mother's procrastination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's by choice or by some psychological problem that forces 
her to live like this," he said. "But she'll fight to the death to prevent 
anybody from helping her. . . I feel sorry for her, but unless she makes a 
decision to change, there's nothing I can do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychologist's Opinion 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Roberts said she has seen a psychologist, who Roberts said believes 
she might be suffering from an obsessive-compulsive disorder that prevents her 
from discarding things she really doesn't need. Although she said she didn't 
know if she would pursue treatment, she joked that she would make "a pretty 
good guinea pig" if someone wanted to study the ailment. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Roberts is homeless and without any particular plan. Nights 
are passed curled up in an isolated corner of Camarillo that she doesn't want 
to reveal. Days are spent in a nearby self-storage locker picking treasures 
from the boxes of junk she was able to salvage from her house. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing of real value," she said, gazing at a few yellowing photos. "Just 
sentimental."

GOURMET FOOD FAIR, AUCTION SET FOR VENICE ART WALK '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it started 10 years ago, the Venice Art Walk was just another fund-raiser. 
Participants paid for self-guided and docent tours of local artists' galleries 
and studios, and the proceeds benefited the nonprofit Venice Family Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the one-day event netted $575,000 for the volunteer health facility. 
</P>
<P>
Art folks, clinic folks and lots and lots of press folks went to DC3, the hip 
new restaurant at the Santa Monica Airport, on Tuesday afternoon to learn more 
about the upcoming walk and to meet the people involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Even Bigger' 
</P>
<P>
This year's Art Walk, scheduled for May 21, is expected to be "even bigger, 
providing 40% of our annual operating budget," said Fern Seizer, executive 
director of the clinic, as small planes buzzed by in the background. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Art Walk also will feature a gourmet food fair with chow provided from 
tony Westside restaurants such as Rebecca's, West Beach Cafe and 72 Market 
Street. For $90, guests can be taken on special docent tours with in-depth 
visits at the studios of artists Peter Alexander, Ed Moses, Tony Berlant, Eric 
Orr, Erika Rothenberg and Robbie Conal. 
</P>
<P>
For the truly well-heeled, clinic president Irma Colen waxed rhapsodic about 
the more than 300 works that will be available in a silent auction. The auction 
alone netted more than $250,000 last year. It's a particularly attractive 
option for artists who were used to contributing works for free. They will get 
to keep half of the proceeds from the sale of their work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a smart move," said art man-about-town Charlie Scheips, who helped to 
organize the recent Art Against AIDS auction at the Murray Feldman Gallery. 
"Giving the artists half the money makes sure that they donate their best 
work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lure of Hors D'Oeuvres 
</P>
<P>
For the kick-off party, the lure of free hors d'oeuvres at the trendy eatery 
brought out hundreds of artists and press people, who kept up a steady stream 
of chatter even as Art Walk chairwoman Sheila Goldberg tried to explain the ins 
and outs of the walk to the crowd. She showed off the '89 T-shirt, designed by 
artist Laddie John Dill, and the commemorative poster designed by Richard 
Diebenkorn, whose show is at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Dill was at 
the party wearing his T-shirt creation, but Diebenkorn was said to be ill at 
his Northern California home. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Walk will conclude with a dinner honoring Karen and Michael Gould at a 
hangar at the Santa Monica Airport. She sits on the board of directors for the 
clinic; he's president of Giorgio Beverly Hills. Dr. Joseph Hittelman will 
receive an award for his volunteer service to the clinic's patients. 
</P>
<P>
When the sun began to go down in the overcast sky over the beach and the 
waiters stopped coming around with trays of appetizers, guests and press began 
filtering out to get their own dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Goldberg was tired, but she had one last word when asked what the clinic 
was planning for the 1990 Art Walk. "It's going to be a two-day event," she 
said, beaming, adding quickly, "don't tell the artists I said that."

CRITIC AT LARGE: SINGERS SOCIETY RAISING MONEY TO AID ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For anyone of what the French delicately call a certain age, the names would 
evoke memories as romantic as a starry sky. They were the singers with the 
bands when the bands were big -- the men and the women and the close-harmony 
groups who sang the pop tunes and the ballads that were the underscoring of our 
lives for a quarter-century or more. 
</P>
<P>
The singers, some of them, won't be identified here because they have fallen 
onto hard times. Their plight, which in some cases paralleled the attempt to 
evict the dying Woody Herman from his home, led in 1983 to the formation of the 
Society of Singers, to lend a hand to the vocalists who were suffering in 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
The society, which now has 500 members -- singers and friends of singers -- is 
having its first major fund-raiser on April 28 in the form of a tribute to Ella 
Fitzgerald, whom no one would seriously challenge as the best female singer of 
popular songs in our day. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cosby will be the emcee. Clint Eastwood will present the honors to 
Fitzgerald. A large number of stars will appear, including Mel Torme and George 
Shearing, Carol Burnett, Dionne Warwick and Patty Austin. There will be a 
special tribute, "The Ladies Who Sang With The Bands," and among the singing 
ladies will be Bea Wain, Martha Tilton, Helen Forrest, Kay Starr, Helen 
O'Connell, Kitty Kallen, Fran Warren and the Clark Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
The night is virtually a sellout already. Additional money will be raised by 
selling lithographs of a special painting by Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
The founder-leader of the society is Ginny Mancini, who did a lot of singing 
herself. She joined Mel Torme and the Mel-Tones right out of Los Angeles City 
College. When Torme elected to go on his own as a single, she tried out for the 
Tex Beneke band's Mello-Larks. The band's pianist, who played for her audition, 
was Henry Mancini, and they've been married since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mancinis left the Beneke organization and returned to Los Angeles, he 
to try his hand at composing for the movies, she continued to work as a 
production singer in television, on various shows, among them "The Dinah Shore 
Show" and, for a dozen years, "The Red Skelton Show." 
</P>
<P>
One of the case histories that persuaded her how badly something like the 
Society of Singers was needed, Ginny Mancini said recently, was the story of 
Bonnie Lou Williams. "She'd sung with Tommy Dorsey, and when that ended she did 
some ghost singing in the movies for June Haver and Ava Gardner. For a while 
she programmed music tapes for airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Then she became terminally ill. She couldn't pay her medical bills and she was 
about to be evicted from her apartment." The society found that the American 
Guild of Variety Artists had a relief fund for which Williams was eligible. The 
eviction was forestalled, and Williams was spared the last indignity. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Bonnie Lou died, she said, 'Use me as an example. Maybe it'll help 
somebody else.' And so we do," Mancini says. "Otherwise everything we do is 
entirely confidential." 
</P>
<P>
In a typical case, the society put up money for urgent surgery a singer could 
not afford. 
</P>
<P>
The society's staff does a lot of networking with the various guilds and with 
the Actor's Fund, checking eligibility for help. The difficulty, Mancini says, 
is that for many singers, "Fame lasts only a minute," not long enough to build 
up the service years unions require for pension and medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
An older injustice is that the royalties from hit records went to the 
bandleader, the composer and the publisher but seldom to the vocalists. "Judy 
(Garland) never made a dime from the sound track recording of 'Over the 
Rainbow,' " Ginny Mancini says. 
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Verdi created a home, Casa Verdi, for the opera singers who had served 
him so well. A principal aim of the Society of Singers is to create a 
comparable retirement facility for the singers who sang with the bands, and in 
the vocal groups. "We dream of breaking ground within five years," Ginny 
Mancini says. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't it be lovely if Irving Berlin, for example, left a sum in his will 
for something like Casa Verdi, for those who sang his songs professionally." 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, where a great number of singers live and work, has been suggested as 
a site. "Casa Verdi West," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The singers the society is presently helping are in part casualties of changes 
in the musical scene, notably the end of the big band era, and of their 
ineligibility for industry as opposed to government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the problem is not confined to the survivors of the big band days. There's 
a new generation of singers -- "session singers, jingle singers, production 
singers, cabaret and musical comedy singers," Mancini says. "Who is to say some 
of them won't need a hand when their minute of fame is over? The younger 
singers may benefit most of all." 
</P>
<P>
How large the population of singers, distressed or solvent, is no one quite 
knows. "This is the first time singers have really talked to each other. We've 
never really fraternized beyond our immediate friends. Kay Starr says, 'How 
come we were all asleep so long?' " 
</P>
<P>
But now they are asleep no longer. "You can't put a lady on the street. Or a 
gentleman," Ginny Mancini says. "Not these people who raised the singing of 
popular songs to an art form."

Ralph Lee White, a former Stockton councilman who was thrown out of office for 
bribing a voter, announced his candidacy for state controller on a platform of 
legalizing drugs."We should legalize drugs because it would stop the killing 
between gangs," White said at a Stockton news conference announcing his 
candidacy for the Democratic nomination, if incumbent Gray Davis runs for 
governor as expected. White's colorful and controversial career on the City 
Council ended in 1987, when the state Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling 
disqualifying him from the seat he won in a 1984 special election.

Ladies' nights, which offer women reduced prices to attract business, violate 
laws against sex discrimination, the Iowa Supreme Court said. Although the 
ruling was based on a promotion at a greyhound racing track, legal experts said 
the ruling could have major implications for restaurants, theaters and other 
businesses that offer discounts to members of one sex. The high court ordered 
the reinstatement of a lawsuit against Bluffs Run, a Council Bluffs dog racing 
track. The Iowa West Racing Assn., operator of Bluffs Run, offered a "Ladies' 
Day" promotion every Wednesday from June to September, 1987. Women received 
free admission into the grandstand and got discounted prices on food, drinks 
and souvenirs.

One week before the Supreme Court hears arguments in a key abortion rights 
case, an abortion rights group took to the airwaves with a $2-million ad 
campaign while an anti-abortion group said it plans to run newspaper ads next 
week to stir America's grass roots. The National Abortion Rights Action League 
began running television, radio and newspaper ads to present its side and build 
on the energy displayed at an abortion rights march that drew at least 300,000 
to the nation's Capitol earlier this month. Meanwhile, the American Civil 
Liberties Union today plans to deliver more than 200,000 letters to the Justice 
Department asking the department to drop its attempt to persuade the Supreme 
Court to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. Oral 
arguments are scheduled for next Wednesday.

Police and casino security agents were on alert because of warnings that 
terrorists might be plotting a bomb attack in New Jersey's seaside gaming 
resort to mark the third anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya. Atlantic 
City casinos said they had been taking extra precautions in light of the 
warning, but casinos said they had been told by the FBI not to discuss details. 
The warning involved a bomb threat against the resort's casino industry in 
general, not a specific gaming house, said Gary Selesner, marketing vice 
president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. "We understand that the bomb threat 
ends tonight," he said late Wednesday.

THRONG JOINS IN TRIBUTE TO SUGAR RAY ROBINSON; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING GREAT CALLED HERO IN AND OUT OF RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boxer Sugar Ray Robinson once toured Europe with a group that included his 
manager, secretary, masseur, barber, two trainers, a voice teacher, drama 
coach, golf pro and a pink Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
But that entourage was nothing compared to the throng that gathered in Los 
Angeles on Wednesday for the champion's last trip. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 mourners -- including Olympic gold medal winners, boxing 
champions, other notables in sports, entertainment and politics, and, simply 
fans -- attended a memorial service and funeral for Robinson who died April 12 
at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
West Angeles Church of God in Christ was filled and dozens of other mourners 
stood outside to hear the words spoken about the man considered by many to have 
been the greatest prizefighter ever. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who had lived in Los Angeles for 27 years, was revered as a hero both 
in and out of the ring -- a selfless family man whose quiet dignity and 
elegance help him transcend the sports champion image to cultural hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Champions win events, heroes win people," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose 
eulogy, like others during the service, was marked by moments of deep 
somberness and light humor. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson called Robinson one of the "dominant heroes of our culture" who, along 
with fellow athletes Joe Louis, Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson kicked down 
racial prejudices and barriers to become inspirations for all races. 
</P>
<P>
"Champions are of short duration -- you can be stripped of champion status," 
Jackson said. "Heroes cannot be. Heroes are needed. They give us security and 
confidence. Sugar had charisma and special gifts from God. 
</P>
<P>
"He was part of the American quilt. His patch in that quilt had non-negotiable 
integrity. . . . He was born on the bottom, but left on the top. He went from 
the 'guttermost' to the 'uppermost.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jackson drew laughter when he noted that after the fighter arrived in Europe, 
he added to his huge entourage by hiring a midget as an interpreter. "Eat your 
heart out, Don King!" Jackson quipped, referring to the flamboyant boxing 
promoter, who was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial service was attended by several fighters, many long retired, while 
others were among the dominant figures of the sport today. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight champion of the world Mike Tyson twice became choked with emotion 
while speaking about the man he said he had never seen fight, yet who had 
served as an inspiration to him. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of the name Sugar Ray Robinson, you think of class and style 
and dignity," Tyson said. "I had the opportunity to meet him once. . . . (He 
had) a great impact on me with very few words." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired in 1965 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who died of heart disease, leaves his wife, Millie, sons Ronald and 
Ray Jr., a stepson, Butch Robinson, a stepdaughter, Ramona Lewis, and a sister, 
Evelyn Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson held the welterweight championship in the 1940s and the middleweight 
title five times in the following decade. He had 201 fights, winning 109 by 
knockout and losing only 19 bouts in a 25-year career. He retired in 1965 at 
age 44. 
</P>
<P>
Sportswriters of the era said that "pound for pound" he was the best ever. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles in 1969 he helped found the nonprofit Sugar Ray Robinson Youth 
Foundation, which each year provides 2,000 underprivileged young people with 
social, sports and other recreational activities. One foundation alumnus is 
Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner, who attended the service 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the service began, the front hall of the church was crowded with 
fighters, young and old. There was no mistaking the flattened noses, scarred 
brows and cauliflower ears for anything but the souvenirs of fighting careers, 
some of which never saw the same crowds and venues that Robinson's did. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Waited on Him' 
</P>
<P>
Without a seat and standing outside when the services began was Jimmy Jones, a 
Los Angeles fighter who said he had worked out with Robinson at the old Main 
Street Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I never fought him," he said. "I never sparred with him. I waited on him. He 
was the champion. Whatever he needed, I got it for him. I was happy just to be 
in the same gym. That's why I come here, to pay my respects to the man." 
</P>
<P>
Carl (Bobo) Olson did fight Robinson -- four times, losing each bout. 
</P>
<P>
"Sugar Ray was the greatest boxer to ever step into the ring," said Olson, who 
came from Sacramento for the memorial service. " ... He was the best. I tried 
to copy his style a few times, but I couldn't do it. He was too good. The 
second time I fought him it went 15 rounds to a decision. I lost, but I was 
very lucky to have gotten that far with him." 
</P>
<P>
Others said Robinson provided them inspiration for other pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"He was such a wonderful image for a young man to see," said Berry Gordy Jr., 
founder of Motown records. "Style, class, fortitude, never giving up. When he 
stepped into the ring, he was swift, elegant, magnificent and deadly. This man 
was unique." 
</P>
<P>
"Sugar Ray Robinson holds a special place in my heart," added Los Angeles 
Raiders owner Al Davis. "Not only as a friend but one of those special heroes 
when I was young. He captured my imagination. He dared me to dream." 
</P>
<P>
"You only have to look around you to see the legacy of this man," Don King 
said. "This man touched black and white alike, young and old alike, American 
and foreign alike." 
</P>
<P>
Other mourners included former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, actress Elizabeth 
Taylor, and Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the mourners were simply people who respected Robinson's 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I owe something to the man," said a woman named Cheryl, who stood 
outside the church. "I respect what he was able to do, so I came." 
</P>
<P>
When the eulogies ended, the mourners slowly filed past the open casket and a 
black and white photograph wreathed in yellow flowers. The photo, taken during 
the champ's prime, showed Robinson in white trunks, standing in the classic 
fighter's crouch. 
</P>
<P>
Interment was at Evergreen Cemetery.

ALAR FOUND IN APPLES AT FOUR UPSCALE MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apples purchased at four upscale Southern California markets, including Mrs. 
Gooch's Natural Foods Market, were found in independent tests to contain Alar, 
a potentially hazardous chemical that the federal government says is now rarely 
used. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, performed by a laboratory hired by The Times, found Alar traces in 
some varieties of red apples sold at Mrs. Gooch's in Beverly Hills, Gelson's 
Markets in Century City, Bristol Farms in South Pasadena and Farmers Market in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The results show that shopping at so-called luxury or health-oriented stores 
does not necessarily ensure that apples will be Alar-free. They also raise 
questions about the accuracy of the federal government's estimate that only 5% 
of fresh apples are currently treated with the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Samples Contain Alar 
</P>
<P>
Of 25 samples of red apples tested by The Times, nine contained Alar. Earlier 
testing for The Times found Alar in apples sold in two major Southern 
California supermarket chains, Hughes and Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Residues ranged from .59 parts per million in a sample from Gelson's to 9.48 
p.p.m. in a batch from Mrs. Gooch's. The allowable limit for Alar, set by the 
Environmental Protection Agency before it was linked to cancer, is 20 p.p.m. An 
agency spokesman said that amount or less will not cause health problems in the 
short run although it might be harmful over a lifetime of consumption. The 
agency is expected to ban the chemical next year. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Gooch's said Sandy Gooch, the owner, was "rather upset 
and incredulous" when told of the test results. The spokeswoman noted that Mrs. 
Gooch's does not claim that all its apples are Alar-free. However, a store 
employee, who was asked by The Times if any of Mrs. Gooch's apples contained 
Alar, said they did not. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gooch's produce manager said the employee was new and was not authorized 
to give that information to customers. 
</P>
<P>
A sample of Mrs. Gooch's Rome Beauty apples had 9.48 p.p.m. of Alar and its 
large Red Delicious contained residues of 2.62. Shelf signs above those apples 
did not indicate whether Alar was used. Instead, they said the fruit contained 
a wax that was "safe and harmless." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Later Sample Tested 
</P>
<P>
An initial test of Mrs. Gooch's extra fancy Red Delicious "Alar-free" apples 
found no Alar, but a later sample of apples marked "Alar-free" was found to 
contain 1.48 p.p.m. of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gooch's store officials insisted that its "Alar-free Red Delicious" are, 
in fact, free of the chemical, and attributed the test result to an error or to 
the possibility that a customer placed one or two of the Alar-treated apples in 
the "Alar-free" shelf. 
</P>
<P>
E. Jerry Oliveras, associate director of Anresco Inc., a San Francisco 
laboratory that performed The Times' tests, described the chances of an 
incorrect positive result for Alar as "very small, extremely small." He said, 
however, that one "hot" apple containing large amounts of Alar can 
substantially change the Alar content of a sample of 10 apples. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hachiya, produce buyer for Mrs. Gooch's, said he does not believe the store 
mixed up Alar-treated fruit with the other apples and maintained that he did 
not use fruit from another grower to supplement his regular supply. The store 
did not dispute that their commercially grown red apples contain Alar, although 
the spokeswoman described the 9.48 p.p.m. detected in one sample as "off the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
Following The Times' results, Mrs. Gooch's hired another laboratory to test its 
apples. A spokeswoman said no Alar was found in its "Alar-free" apples, or its 
small and large Red Delicious. Rome Beauties contained 2.7 p.p.m. of Alar, she 
said. Those apples were taken from unpacked produce crates. The Times tested 
fruit from the store's bins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Recent Tests 
</P>
<P>
The Times also recently tested apples from Lucky, Hughes, Vons and Ralphs. Of 
23 samples, five had Alar. None was found in the apples from Vons and Ralphs, 
which submit their fruit to a private laboratory for testing. Hughes and Lucky, 
whose apples were found to contain Alar traces, have since begun submitting 
their fruit for laboratory screening. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Consumers Union, private laboratories and a grower said in 
interviews that they were skeptical of the EPA's estimate that only 5% of fresh 
apples are treated with Alar. The Consumers Union, the New York-based publisher 
of Consumer Reports, tested red apples earlier this year and found that 55% 
contained the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA concedes that its estimate is not authoritative because records are not 
kept on use. However, the agency says that other surveys, such as those of The 
Times and Consumers Union, are finding higher percentages because their tests 
involve only red apples. The EPA's estimate includes green and yellow apples, 
which are rarely treated. 
</P>
<P>
Growers also say that the apples on the shelf now are more likely to contain 
the chemical than those sold earlier in the season. Alar is sprayed on apples 
intended for storage to keep them crisp and attractive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persists in Root System 
</P>
<P>
The EPA says the average Alar residue detected on apples is 1 p.p.m. -- 1/20th 
of the allowable level. Amounts less than that may result from Alar use in 
previous seasons because the chemical persists in the root system of the tree. 
For every 100,000 people who eat apples containing 1 p.p.m. Alar, there will be 
about 4.5 additional cancer cases over their lifetime, according to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
At Gelson's Century City store, 1.74 p.p.m. of Alar was found in small Red 
Delicious, .73 p.p.m. in McIntosh and .59 p.p.m. in large Red Delicious. Shelf 
signs say the store purchases apples only from packers that require growers to 
document that Alar was not used. "In spite of these measures," says a 
disclaimer on the sign, "consumers should be aware that in some instances 
apples may contain Alar residue." 
</P>
<P>
Allan Scharn, president of Encino-based Gelson's Markets, said the eight-store 
chain requires its apple suppliers to certify that Alar was not used. In 
addition, the market submits random samples of apples to an independent 
laboratory for verification and returns any fruit in which the chemical is 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
He said the chain recently put the disclaimer on its signs because "the nature 
of agriculture is such that we do not feel that there is any way we can 
absolutely guarantee that a particular apple or a particular sample of apple 
may not contain that residue." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of the roll of the dice. . ," he said. "There seems to be evidence 
that the residue from applications in the orchard can remain in the soil from 
one season to the next, and also there is the possibility of an over-spray 
application from an adjoining orchard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Test Produce 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Gelson's, Jurgensen's Grocery Co. in South Pasadena does not test its 
produce. But the president of the market said growers provide test results 
showing that no Alar was used. The Times tests did not detect any Alar in 
Jurgensen's apples. 
</P>
<P>
At Bristol Farms in South Pasadena, a sample of Red Rome apples was found to 
contain 3.6 p.p.m. of Alar. Grant Gravatte, produce director for the markets, 
said the store tested its apples for Alar two weeks ago. The Red Romes were not 
tested, however, because they were not available at the time, he said. 
Following The Times' findings, Gravatte said, the Red Romes were removed from 
the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Apples from two produce stands at Farmers Market also contained Alar. Rome 
Beauty apples sold at Macardican's Fruit Stand had 1.65 p.p.m., and Rome Beauty 
from Farm Fresh Produce contained 1.59 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Otsuji, owner of Macardican's, said he wishes Alar would be removed from 
the market because he cannot assure his customers that his apples are free of 
the chemical. Robert Stone, owner of Farm Fresh, said he has never asked his 
suppliers whether the fruit contains Alar. 
</P>
<P>
A Farm Fresh employee, asked by The Times if the apples contained Alar, said 
"no spray" was used. Stone said his employees "probably don't know what the 
hell (Alar) is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TESTING FOR ALAR 
</P>
<P>
 Apples from five markets -- Mrs. Gooch's, Jurgensen's, Gelson's, Bristol Farms 
and Farmers Market -- were tested for daminozide, a growth regulator marketed 
under the brand name Alar, which has been linked to cancer. Twenty-five samples 
of 10 apples each were tested. No Alar was found in Jurgensen's apples. The 
allowable level for Alar on apples is 20 parts per million. Anresco Inc., a San 
Francisco laboratory, did the testing for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory, established in 1943, tests for pesticides, preservatives, 
nutrients and other compounds in food, usually for private companies. Anresco 
used the government-approved PAM II testing method in which apples are put in a 
blender, mixed with sodium hydroxide, titanium trichloride, an anti-foam agent 
and zinc granules. The mixture is heated and decomposed into unsymmetrical 
dymethyl hydrazine (UDMH), a breakdown product of Alar. Results are read in a 
spectrometer, with color intensities proportional to the amount of Alar in the 
sample. The test has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%. Amounts expressed 
in parts per million.

HEAD OF NEW ETHICS PANEL BELIEVES IN THE CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geoffrey Cowan, the former California Common Cause chairman drafted by Mayor 
Tom Bradley last week to captain a new City Hall ethics commission, wants to 
define a new era of propriety in state and local government. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley's critics say Cowan's hastily created panel may be nothing more 
than a face-saving mechanism for a mayor dogged by conflict-of-interest 
questions over fees he collected from local financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Bradley is very well known for . . . anytime there's a problem, he appoints a 
committee. Much later, the committee acts, with recommendations. And that's the 
extent of it," said City Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UCLA Lecturer 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, a 46-year-old public interest lawyer, UCLA lecturer and author who is 
well connected to the city's liberal elite, is undeterred. He insisted that his 
panel will be independent and, even before the seven members have met, he 
ticked off an array of ideas he thinks should be embodied in the panel's 
proposed ethics code for elected and top officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan wants the panel to look at reforms that Common Cause has fought for 
unsuccessfully at the congressional level, including a ban on outside earnings, 
speaking honorariums and most gifts. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to tighten up the so-called "revolving door" practice by which 
city employees, politicians or their aides move into private-sector or lobbying 
jobs related to city business. 
</P>
<P>
And he wants the panel to recommend the creation of a new city investigative 
board that would have subpoena power and the authority to impose penalties and 
to enforce the new ethics regulations. Almost everyone agrees that the current 
30-year-old code is toothless. 
</P>
<P>
"I think often opportunities for reform come out of crisis," Cowan said. "We 
have here a unique opportunity in the recent history of Los Angeles to do 
something about . . . a serious problem. Maybe not as serious as it is in New 
York and Chicago, but it's serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I want whatever we do here . . . to be absolutely the standard by which every 
other community (in the nation) will be judged," Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan is clear about the controversy that precipitated his appointment: 
Bradley's acceptance of tens of thousands of dollars from a local bank and a 
savings and loan that had dealings with the city. "He should not have done it," 
Cowan said. "I'm absolutely clear in my mind that he should not have done it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidence of Others 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's agenda may sound very ambitious, but those know him think he might just 
pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is a tremendous choice as someone to try," said Fred Wertheimer, 
Washington-based president of National Common Cause, a nonpartisan political 
watchdog group. "I think the climate is right . . . (and) politics in America 
travels from west to east. (Los Angeles) could be the model for cities across 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's name is not well known. "I have a passion for privacy," he said. But he 
is no newcomer to the political trenches. He has contributed to Bradley's 
campaigns and was part of a losing group of bidders a few years ago in one of 
City Hall's great lobbying battles over the awarding of a lucrative San 
Fernando Valley cable-television franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked first by a team of evaluators, his firm was passed over amid a final, 
intense lobbying drive when the matter went to a vote at the City Council. "I 
think what I saw there makes me vastly more sensitive" to how City Hall works, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan moves among the high circles of liberal Democratic politics and 
entertainment. For fun a few years back, he and several friends, including 
Democratic activist-lawyer-lobbyist Mickey Kantor, Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner and Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, bought a minor league baseball team, the Stockton Ports. 
</P>
<P>
The praise that Cowan's name evokes in liberal circles is effusive. "I'd like a 
buck for every time I've called Geoff Cowan for an opinion, especially on 
matters of judgment," said producer Norman Lear, a longtime friend. "He's like 
a walking neon that says: 'Decent. Decent. Decent.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anyone of higher moral integrity," Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan is a genteel, scholarly, graying man with young children and a 
politically active wife, Aileen Adams, a Bradley appointee to the city Fire 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background in Ethics 
</P>
<P>
He brings to his sensitive City Hall assignment a wide background in political 
and media ethics. 
</P>
<P>
It was an interest forged early in life. When he a was high school senior back 
East, Cowan's family was rocked by the television quiz show scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's father, Louis G. Cowan, had once been a producer of "The $64,000 
Question." When the scandal broke, his father was president of CBS, but no 
longer directly associated with the show. Though his father was never 
implicated in wrongdoing, Cowan said, he was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS felt that it was uncomfortable for them to have him as their president. . 
. . They made it untenable," he said. His father, deeply wounded, according to 
his son, left television and became a professor at Columbia University's 
Graduate School of Journalism, where he helped found the Columbia Journalism 
Review, a watchdog publication for the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
"My father's experience emphasized to me that, while I have . . . a very strong 
commitment to ethics . . . I'm also very concerned about unfair charges," Cowan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan went to Harvard and then to Yale Law School, inheriting from his parents 
a sense of political activism and public duty, and enough money to freely 
fulfill it. 
</P>
<P>
He was a freedom rider in the civil rights movement. He helped draft the 
landmark Democratic Party reforms in the late 1960s that opened up the 
presidential nominating process and reduced the influence of party bosses. He 
co-founded the nation's first public interest law firm in Washington and later 
became the first director of the UCLA Communications Law Program and practiced 
public interest law in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
As state chairman of Common Cause for the last four years, he pushed the 
organization's statewide campaign finance ballot initiative. He remains on the 
National Common Cause board, where he has been working on proposals for new 
ethics codes for state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Writing Second Book 
</P>
<P>
He continues to lecture part time at UCLA on media issues and is writing his 
second book, set in Los Angeles' Progressive political reform movement of the 
early 1900s. Later this year, he hopes to produce his play about the ethical 
dilemmas faced by key participants in the Pentagon Papers case. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan will take time out from writing his book. Writing the ethics code will be 
challenge enough, given City Hall's contentious politics and the myriad gray 
areas between officials' public responsibilities and personal interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Geoff will find it is easier to set the principle than establish the rule," 
said Common Cause Executive Director Walter Zelman. "When you start defining 
every single circumstance, you start having problems." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan himself is not certain about how far to go in restricting officials' 
outside investments. For example, questions have been raised about a Riverside 
County land deal in which Bradley is a partner with a woman who runs a 
city-funded trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Blind trusts could be a solution, Cowan said. "Those are dilemmas that you've 
got to struggle with . . . (but) you can't pauperize people (who) take jobs in 
public service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His greatest task may be building bridges to the City Council, which he hopes 
will ultimately adopt his panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"This (ethics panel) could be construed as a deflection of the real issue," 
said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, referring to the mayor's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woo's Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, whose committee will soon delve into ethics issues, 
stressed that the effort by the Bradley-appointed panel "is independent of what 
the council does." He said his committee will not only consider how to 
strengthen the city's largely ignored ethics code, but will keep the pressure 
on the city attorney for a thorough investigation of the questions about 
Bradley's dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Notably, both Woo and Ferraro questioned the need for a ban on outside earned 
income for council members, noting that few have received the kind of fees that 
the mayor accepted. Financial disclosure records show that is true. However, 
many council members do have investment income, some accept honorariums and 
several report receiving thousands of dollars in dinners and gifts from 
lobbyists, developers, amusement parks, sports teams and others. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said he hopes to reach some common ground with the council. "We don't 
want to be confrontational," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also carries a stick. 
</P>
<P>
His panel's recommendations, expected to be completed in a matter of months, 
could become a ballot initiative, he said, and Bradley has indicated that he 
would back such a measure, if necessary.

EMPLOYEE WINS $885,000 IN REGISTER SEX BIAS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Orange County Register circulation supervisor who says she was passed 
over for promotion twice in favor of less qualified men won $885,000 from the 
newspaper Wednesday in a sex-discrimination award that legal specialists called 
one of the largest of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just ecstatic," said Susan L. Martinolich, 43, of Orange. "This means that 
women at the paper are going to have to be taken more seriously, particularly 
in the circulation department. Women aren't going to be afraid to stand up and 
be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits seeking to show sex discrimination in employment practices are 
extremely tough to prove and rarely go to trial, experts say. But Martinolich's 
victory was particularly stunning in the size of the punitive damages -- 
$800,000 -- and because she was not fired and was suing the newspaper alone 
rather than as part of a class-action group, legal experts in the field said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Accepts Verdict 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew, finding that 
Martinolich was in fact discriminated against based on gender, accepted with 
only minor variations a jury verdict handed down the previous day after a 
2-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Register officials expressed anger and surprise at the verdict against them and 
denied any wrongdoing in their treatment of Martinolich, who still works at the 
newspaper but has transferred out of the circulation department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miscarriage of justice, plain and simple," said Tom Peterson, vice 
president for circulation. "My reaction is one of absolute shock, and so too 
with everyone in the department and this newspaper. We don't believe for a 
minute that we did anything to discriminate against her." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and the newspaper's lead attorney in the case said they expect to 
appeal the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised to see this stand up on appeal," said defense attorney 
Kasey Haws of Costa Mesa. "I'm confident that the finding went completely 
against the weight of the evidence; there simply was no discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Martinolich began working in the Register's circulation department in the 
summer of 1983 and within 2 years had worked her way up to assistant zone 
manager, earning several commendations from the newspaper along the way for her 
performance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed Over for Job 
</P>
<P>
When the job of zone manager opened up at the end of 1985, she assumed the 
position on an acting basis for several weeks. But Martinolich -- without being 
interviewed -- was passed over for the post in favor of a man from outside the 
paper, she alleged. And when the position later became vacant again, she met 
with similar results. 
</P>
<P>
Register attorneys maintained at the federal court trial that Martinolich never 
applied for the job. But Martinolich and her lawyer countered that she did in 
fact file a formal application, which was intentionally lost or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
They also presented anecdotal evidence to suggest that higher-level supervisors 
in circulation expressed biases toward women and their capacities to carry out 
managerial assignments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pattern Claimed 
</P>
<P>
Racine also charged in an interview that Martinolich's case fits into a pattern 
of discrimination within the Register circulation department that has seen 
women blocked from higher positions with the exception of a few isolated cases 
of "tokenism." 
</P>
<P>
"The women are just treated differently than the men in the department," 
Martinolich said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The jury returned $800,000 in punitive damages against the Register and 
recommended general damages of $120,000, although the judge granted only 
$85,000 in general damages. The jury also rejected Martinolich's claims that 
she was discriminated on the basis of age because supervisors said she was too 
old for the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawyers around the country who specialize in discrimination complaints 
said the verdict clearly marked one of the largest punitive awards in the state 
for a discrimination case and among the highest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A statistical comparision of monetary verdicts was not available Wednesday, but 
Gloria Allred, a nationally known attorney in Los Angeles, estimated the 
verdict to be in the top 1% of all discrimination awards nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Added Wayne Ooutten, a New York attorney and executive officer with the 
Plaintiff Employment Lawyers Assn.: "There's no doubt that this is among the 
highest for discrimination cases. That's quite substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Martinolich, who transferred to the telemarketing department, is now on 
disability leave from the Register for high blood pressure that she says she 
suffered as a result of her employment problems.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY AWARD AGAINST CHIEF GATES UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has upheld the $170,014 jury award against Los Angeles Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates in the case of an East Los Angeles man whose nose was 
broken by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both Gates and the plaintiffs said the verdict was the first in 
the nation to hold liable the active police chief of a major city for excessive 
force committed by his officers. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi rejected the city's request to set aside 
the verdict reached by a six-member federal court jury last fall in favor of 
Jessie Larez, his wife and five children over a June 13, 1986, raid on their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Six members of the police anti-gang unit allegedly ransacked the house, broke 
Larez's nose and roughed up his children while looking for a gun used in a gang 
killing. No gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors initially assessed $90,503 in damages against the officers. After a 
second phase, the jury assessed $170,000 in punitive damages against Gates. The 
Larez family's attorneys, Stephen and Marian Yagman, vowed to reject a check 
from the city, insisting that the $170,000 come out of Gates' pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. City Atty. Richard Helgeson said Gates will appeal and that if he loses, 
the city will pay.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMELESS SHELTER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley's largest homeless shelter has filed for protection 
from its creditors in federal Bankruptcy Court in a last-ditch effort to stay 
open. 
</P>
<P>
"The shelter could not continue to survive without this," said Sydney Irmas, 
chairman of Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., the nonprofit organization that 
operates the 72-room North Hollywood shelter. "It had to have some relief from 
the mortgage payments . . . none had been paid in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, a converted motel, filed under Chapter 11 of the federal 
Bankruptcy Code, freezing its $2.24 million in assets and preventing creditors 
from suing or foreclosing on its building.

BUSH VISIT CONFIRMED; DUE AT ANTI-DRUG EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will stop in Orange County on Wednesday for an anti-drug event 
at Rancho del Rio, the remote and scenic headquarters of a former notorious 
drug smuggler, sources have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an advance team from the White House toured the 213-acre ranch, 
which includes vineyards, a wine press and eight houses made of hand-laid 
stone, imported logs and tile. The ranch, which has a view of Santa Catalina 
Island, is accessible only by a treacherous 4-mile dirt road and an unpaved 
runway that was used by the smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the visit was confirmed. Sources said Bush will present Sheriff 
Brad Gates and other law enforcement officials with a check for $4.39 million 
-- their share of a heroin bust made by the Orange County Regional Narcotics 
Suppression Task Force on Feb. 10, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources said it may be the largest check ever given to a single 
police agency since a 1984 federal law allowed local police to use property and 
cash seized from drug traffickers to pay for drug enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho del Rio was deeded to Orange County after the Sheriff's Department 
seized it during a separate drug investigation on March 1, 1985. The ranch is 
at the juncture of Orange, San Diego and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is also scheduled to visit Los Angeles Tuesday and Wednesday, officials 
said.

STATE SEEKS TO REVOKE PAP LAB'S LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Health Services Director Kenneth Kizer announced Wednesday that he and 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp will go to court in an effort to revoke the 
medical license of Central Pathology Services Medical Group in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer ordered Central Pathology shut down last week after a March inspection 
found that the lab had misdiagnosed 21% of a randomly selected group of 1,103 
Pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee that two months from now, they won't say, 'The state 
didn't take away our license. We'll just reopen,' " Kizer said at a press 
conference outside Central Pathology's offices. "Obviously, we are not going to 
allow an operation to continue that has this sort of error rate." 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology processed nearly 700,000 Pap smears a year, including more 
than half of all those taken in Southern California. Pap smears are used by 
physicians to detect cervical cancer and other medical abnormalities in women. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer has also ordered the lab to contact hundreds of thousands of women whose 
Pap slides showed no abnormalities and offer to pay for retesting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid to Ease Fears 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health Services director said he came to Los Angeles to ease 
public fears over the number of errors Central Pathology allegedly made in 
diagnosing slides. Kizer recommended that women contact physicians and clinics 
that administered their Pap tests. "There is no reason to panic," Kizer said. 
"There is reason to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Van de Kamp confirmed that the attorney general will join Kizer 
in seeking to take away the lab's license. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health Services issues operating licenses to labs but state 
law requires a judge's approval to revoke a license. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer's announcement surprised Central Pathology's executives. "We weren't even 
notified of this event," said Martin Cooper, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper reiterated that "we believe that the lab has high quality-control 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology's closure has created an overwhelming volume of new business 
for other Pap labs. Some have reported turning down requests to handle Pap 
smears from former Central Pathology clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognized that the action taken against this laboratory is going to result 
in some problems here in Southern California," Kizer said. "There is going to 
be a bit of a backlog." 
</P>
<P>
Kizer also elaborated on plans for stricter oversight of Pap smear labs, 
including limits on the number of slides cytotechnologists may read per day, a 
licensing program for technologists and closer inspection of labs. 
</P>
<P>
At present, for example, state inspectors do not examine actual Pap slides 
during visits. Central Pathology said it had passed more than 20 annual 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not realize (inspectors) were not doing that kind of quality assurance," 
Kizer said. "That is part of what we are going to be doing and redoing in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
During the next six weeks, state investigators will inspect 10 other Pap labs 
in California. There are about 500 Pap smear companies in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the problems that have resulted here (at Central Pathology) are 
because of lack of adequate management oversight, lack of supervision of the 
technologists and other things that are peculiar to this lab," Kizer said. 
"Perhaps they have spent more attention on their marketing department than on 
their quality assurance department."

GIONIS LAWYER BLAMES INVESTIGATOR; 
</P>
<P>
GAL DESCRIBED AS 'FREE AGENT' IN WAYNE ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills private investigator hired to trail John Wayne's daughter in a 
custody dispute acted as a "free agent" in orchestrating a brutal attack 
against her, defense attorney F. Lee Bailey argued in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, representing Dr. Thomas A. Gionis on charges of masterminding the Oct. 
3 assault on Aissa Wayne and her then-boyfriend, Roger W. Luby, portrayed 
private investigator O. Daniel Gal as "easily offended" and having "a red hot 
temper." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing in Third Day 
</P>
<P>
Gionis had retained Gal to monitor the activities of Wayne, his ex-wife, during 
a 7-month period last year when their battle for custody of an infant daughter, 
Anastasia, was proceeding through Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey intimated that Gal staged the assault because Luby, 53, had offended him 
during the months that Gal had Wayne, 33, under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that private investigators are often angrily confronted by the targets 
of their surveillance, Bailey said that most investigators learn to let insults 
"roll off their back." But in Gal's case, Bailey suggested, "it might not roll 
off his back." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey's assertions came in the third day of a preliminary hearing at Municipal 
Court in Newport Beach to determine whether Gionis, a 35-year-old orthopedic 
surgeon from Pomona, should be bound over for trial in Orange County Superior 
Court. Closing arguments are scheduled for this afternoon, after which 
Municipal Judge Susanne S. Shaw will render a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Gal, meanwhile, remained under arrest in Switzerland, where Newport Beach 
detectives have flown to try to extradite him to California to face charges of 
conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon. He was detained by Interpol 
agents last week on a $1-million arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, an unemployed apartment manager from 
Burbank, and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool cleaner from Simi 
Valley, remained in Orange County Jail on charges that they carried out the 
attack while in Gal's employ. Both men, arrested in March, are also being held 
on $1-million bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey -- a flamboyant Massachusetts lawyer who took over the Gionis case this 
week -- has said all during the hearing that his client knew nothing of the 
attack, and that it was apparently targeted against Luby, not Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey cited Luby's legal troubles over a failed real estate deal in downtown 
Los Angeles as one scenario that could have triggered the incident. He said the 
only other plausible scenario is that Gal, whom he described as 
"hypersensitive" and "obsessive," acted on his own after losing his temper with 
Luby. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans scoffed at both scenarios, saying his 
office would not have filed criminal conspiracy charges against Gionis "if 
there had not been a conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey attempted to elicit testimony about Gal's allegedly explosive 
personality from Xanthi Gionis, 25-year-old sister of the surgeon, but was 
prevented from doing so by Shaw, who ruled such character evidence inadmissible 
under California law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testimony on Floor Plan 
</P>
<P>
But Xanthi Gionis' did testify that Gal got floor plans for Wayne's Corona del 
Mar home from Gionis as part of a routine consultation in the custody case 
surveillance, which Bailey said supported the theory that Gionis did not give 
him the plans for the specific purpose of an assault on Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey had testified Tuesday that Gal showed him and Hintergardt a floor plan of 
Wayne's home during a meeting to plan the assault. Wayne testified Wednesday 
that, of the four defendants in custody, only Gionis had been inside her home. 
This led prosecutors to conclude that Gionis had delivered the floor plan to 
Gal for purposes of the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey testified that the assault was originally to take place at Wayne's home, 
but that it was carried out at Luby's when she was found there. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have argued that Gionis arranged the attack to influence the 
outcome of the custody case, which went to trial in November and concluded 2 
months later with a judge's ruling in Gionis' favor. Wayne regained temporary 
custody last week, however, pending the outcome of her ex-husband's criminal 
proceedings. The couple separated in 1987 after a stormy marriage and were 
divorced last summer. Wayne is a daughter of actor John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' defense team also presented evidence Wednesday intended to show their 
client had nothing to gain by assaulting Wayne and Luby because he already had 
a solid custody case prepared against her. 
</P>
<P>
George James Stephan, a Los Angeles attorney who represented Gionis in his 
domestic case, testified that his client had "an excellent case" against Wayne 
because of charts which showed that she spent as little as 13% of her available 
time with Anastasia during visitation periods.

TRIAL ANTICLIMAX: CONVICTED KILLER'S STATEMENT UNREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted killer John Galen Davenport, the last of four Orange County men to 
win new death penalty trials by order of the old state Supreme Court under 
then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, had prepared a six-page statement he 
wanted to read to jurors Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The highly unusual defense request had been approved by Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Everett W. Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
But when the time came, Davenport's lawyers backed down, providing an 
anticlimax in the trial of a man fighting to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys had also asked Dickey to guarantee that prosecutors would not 
be allowed to question Davenport about his crimes after he read the statement. 
The judge refused. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport did testify Wednesday, but did not read the statement, and answered 
only one question. His lawyers had introduced paintings and sketches that 
Davenport produced while in prison. Davenport was asked only to confirm that 
the artwork was his own, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victim Was Impaled 
</P>
<P>
Davenport, now 34, was convicted 8 years ago in the March 27, 1980, stabbing 
death of Gayle Ann Lingle, 30, whom he had met at a Tustin bar. She was found 
nude in a vacant field at Myford Road and Michelle Street in Irvine. She had 
been stabbed 16 times and, significantly to Davenport's trial, had been impaled 
on a 4-foot-long wooden stake. Jurors found that the stake met the legal 
definition of torture, which allowed them to return a death verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport had been released from prison only a short time before Lingle was 
killed. He had served four years for a stabbing attack on another young woman. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld Davenport's conviction in the Lingle death. But the 
court threw out the death verdict on technical grounds and ordered a new 
penalty trial. Three other defendants in Orange County -- Rodney Alcala, 
Marcelino Ramos and Theodore Frank -- won similar new trials from the Bird 
court. All have received new death sentences and are back on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
At Davenport's new trial in Santa Ana, both sides completed their cases 
Wednesday. The new jury must decide only one issue: whether Davenport should be 
returned to Death Row, or receive a lesser sentence of life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers used Davenport's family, who live in Utah, in an attempt to 
show jurors his more positive side. 
</P>
<P>
One Davenport sister, Lori Fausett, told jurors that "Johnnie is my backbone . 
. . when he calls (from jail), he always makes things better." 
</P>
<P>
Another sister, Joy McKendrick, testified that "it's Johnnie we turn to when we 
have troubles. . . . When Leslie (a Davenport brother) died, it was Johnnie who 
got us through it, even though he was in prison and could only call." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Niece's Testimony 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old niece tearfully testified that she had been raped, and that 
emotional support from her uncle, Davenport, had helped her the most in dealing 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson, one nephew 
testified that his uncle has always denied killing Lingle. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Gary M. Pohlson has avoided letting jurors know that Davenport 
still maintains his innocence. But prosecutor Robinson will no doubt emphasize 
the point, based on the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers on both sides Wednesday were wondering whether the show of family 
support for Davenport will offset for jurors the devastating testimony against 
him from the first stabbing victim, Suzanne Tewes. She miraculously survived 
more than 20 stab wounds from an attack after he broke into her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Tewes fought back tears last week when she testified about the 15-year-old 
incident. Jurors at Davenport's 1981 trial said Tewes' testimony was the key to 
their vote for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Dickey on Wednesday declined to release a copy of Davenport's statement 
until he discusses the matter with defense lawyers.

ANGELS GIVE UP RUNS, NOT GAME AS WITT WEATHERS WHITE SOX, 7-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Streaks collided in the sixth inning of the Angels' 7-2 victory over the White 
Sox Wednesday night, with Chicago center fielder Dave Gallagher bidding to 
extend the majors' current longest hitting streak and the Angel pitching staff 
bidding to bump the storied duo of Ryan and Tanana out of the record book. 
</P>
<P>
Heresy, you say? Well, after five shutout innings by Mike Witt, the 1989 Angels 
had run their string of consecutive scoreless innings to 29 -- dangerously 
close to the club record of 32 2/3 innings, set in 1974 by the staff anchored 
by Nolan Ryan and Frank Tanana. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher's quest was somewhat more modest. At stake was an 11-game hitting 
streak, nothing to notify Cooperstown about, but not bad for a team playing its 
14th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
With Ozzie Guillen on second base and an 0-2 count on Gallagher, something had 
to give. History hung in the air as Witt sent a curveball headed for the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
It never quite got there. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher dug the ball out and golfed a run-scoring single into center field, 
at once ending one streak and continuing another: Angel streak hits the wall at 
29, Gallagher streak remains intact at 12. 
</P>
<P>
And Ryan and Tanana ward off a rather implausible assault, the baton having 
been passed from Chuck Finley to Bert Blyleven to Kirk McCaskill to Bryan 
Harvey to Witt. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader reserved his response for another four innings, 
waiting for relief pitcher Greg Minton to retire Gallagher in the bottom of the 
ninth for a more significant out -- the final one. 
</P>
<P>
"The only streaks you're really cognizant of are in the W and L columns," Rader 
said. "Twenty-nine, or whatever it is, is important, but four is even more so. 
</P>
<P>
Four is where another Angel streak -- consecutive victories -- currently 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Before Gallagher drove home Guillen, the Angels were working on a 5-0 lead. 
After Guillen scored, and then Gallagher, the advantage shrunk to 5-2, and when 
the White Sox put two more runners on base in the seventh inning, Rader became 
keenly cognizant of the only streak that matters. 
</P>
<P>
He moved swiftly, first summoning left-handed reliever Bob McClure to retire 
the left-handed-hitting Guillen, which McClure did on a ground ball to second 
base. Then, Rader called for Minton, a right-hander, to finish the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Minton went Rader one further. He finished the game, completing 2 1/3 shutout 
innings to earn his second save of the season, tying him with Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up two runs, but we had the chance to give up five or six," Rader 
said. "That's a tribute to the guys in the bullpen. They did the job we needed 
them to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The attention the starting pitching is getting is warranted and justified, but 
this has been a total staff effort." 
</P>
<P>
Rader had to dip into his relief staff when Witt (2-2), after 3 2/3 hitless 
innings, began to struggle, yielding eight hits in his next 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mike had continued to breeze along, we wouldn't have had the need (to use 
the bullpen)," Rader said. "But I didn't want to tempt fate." 
</P>
<P>
Witt claimed to be unaware of the record he and his fellow pitchers were 
nearing but knew he was following consecutive shutouts by Blyleven and the 
McCaskill-Harvey tag team. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to pitch a shutout," Witt said. "I wanted to pitch a no-hitter. 
Sometimes, things don't work out." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Witt said he ran into problems when he tried to rationalize the whys 
and hows of the first few Chicago hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm in some frame of mind where, if a guy hits a good pitch, I 
don't give him credit for being a good hitter," Witt said. "I tell myself, 
'That was a good pitch -- and he hit. What do I got to do now?' 
</P>
<P>
"Then I start nibbling and get out of the groove." 
</P>
<P>
Witt had the luxury of pitching with a lead, courtesy of Devon White's 
three-run home run in the fifth inning, which followed run-scoring singles by 
Chili Davis and Lance Parrish in the fourth inning. The Angels later added 
unearned runs in the seventh and eighth innings to make a loser of Chicago 
starter Bill Long (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
The shutout and the record got away, but Witt and Co. hung on and hung in for 
the victory, the Angels' third in five games over the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
And about that drama-laden sixth-inning delivery to Gallagher? 
</P>
<P>
"He hit a good pitch," Witt said. "An 0-2 curveball and it wasn't too far off 
the ground when he hit it." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't quite good enough -- and the '89 Angels didn't quite have enough 
to eclipse the '74 Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and Tanana can rest easy for a little while longer. 
</P>
<P>
As well they should. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have found a way to keep both second basemen, Johnny Ray and Mark 
McLemore, on the 24-man roster at the same time, at least temporarily. Manager 
Doug Rader said Wednesday that the Angels will place shortstop Dick Schofield, 
who has a strained chest muscle, on the 21-day disabled list and replace him 
with Ray, eligible to return from the 15-day disabled list. "Schoey's not 
making very much progress," Rader said. "If we put him on the disabled list, we 
can bring back Johnny, give him some at-bats and evaluate how much he's capable 
of playing. Then, we'll make a decision regarding Mark -- what's best for him 
and for the team." Rader said the evaluation will take place in the next few 
days, with Ray easing his way back into the lineup by pinch-hitting, being the 
designated hitter and then playing some at second base. "We want to give him a 
couple of days of legitimate work and see how (the wrist) responds," Rader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Ray: If and when Ray is deemed ready to return to the lineup, McLemore 
figures to return to Edmonton or the bench, .306 batting average 
notwithstanding. Rader said he has no plans to platoon Ray and McLemore -- 
"That's not really productive to anybody," -- and still regards Ray as his 
starting second baseman. "Johnny Ray still has not lost his job," Rader said. 
"An injury should not make it possible for someone to lose his job. Even though 
Mac has done some good things for us, there has to be some deference to what 
Johnny has done over his career and, especially, last year. Those things 
haven't changed since we made our decision in spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Rader was still miffed over the decision to postpone Tuesday's game because of 
the threat of snow, which never materialized. In fact, Tuesday night in Chicago 
turned out to be a calmer evening than Monday, when the Angels and White Sox 
were allowed to play in 39-degree temperatures. "I begged those people to wait 
until 4 before they called it," Rader said. When the decision was made at noon, 
Rader had to decide what to do with his starting rotation -- and opted to 
bypass rookie Jim Abbott's turn.

MORGAN TIPTOES THROUGH REDS, AND DODGERS GET A 3-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may have been a mystery to the sellout crowd of 48,295 at Dodger Stadium why 
pitcher Mike Morgan would leave in the midst of the Dodgers' 3-0 shutout 
victory over the Cincinnati Reds Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the guy sitting in the left-field pavilion couldn't see what catcher Rick 
Dempsey spotted when he walked out to the mound after Morgan's first pitch to 
Eric Davis with two out in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked down at his feet," Dempsey said, "and it looked like his toe was 
sticking a half inch out of his shoe." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan has an abnormal bone growth on his right big toe. With the number 
of needles they've stuck in him the last two years, he must feel like a pin 
cushion. 
</P>
<P>
He estimates that he had six or seven cortisone shots last season, another 
half-dozen the year before, all in an effort to control the swelling in his 
toe. 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder what a cortisone shot feels like? 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts like hell," Morgan said. "It took three or four guys to hold me down 
when they gave me a shot. That ought to speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Last August, while he was still with the Baltimore Orioles, Morgan underwent 
surgery to remove bone chips from the toe. He also swore he was through with 
injections, switching to anti-inflammatory pills instead. 
</P>
<P>
Some nights, like Wednesday, Morgan will only be able to go so far. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to expect that," he said. "When a guy has his arm cut on, he's going 
to have good days and bad days. It's the same thing with my foot." 
</P>
<P>
For Morgan, even on the days he has pitched well, most of his career has been 
spent waiting for the other shoe to drop. That's what comes from having a 
career record of 34-68, the worst of any major league pitcher who has been 
around for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise comes from nights like Wednesday, when Morgan admits to not having 
good stuff, his foot acts up, and he still winds up a winner -- with the help 
of three Dodger relievers who finished off the five-hit shutout, giving the 
Dodgers consecutive blankings of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"Morgan must have had a horseshoe in his pocket," Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose 
said. "The first four innings we hit three or four balls hard for hits, another 
four or five balls hard for outs." 
</P>
<P>
Rose would get no argument from Morgan (1-1), who has as many wins as a Dodger 
as he had all of last season with Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Good scouting reports," Morgan said with a smile, noting the Reds' penchant 
for hitting balls right at people. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have great stuff and get beat by a flare. Tonight, I get patted 
in the back, even though they hit line drives. Hey, I need some breaks in my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey, whose two-out, run-scoring double in the second inning gave Morgan the 
1-0 lead he took into the sixth, decided not to push Morgan's luck too far. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked by me right after we got the second out and said, 'I got to tell 
you, 'My toe is really killing me,' " Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
"That first pitch to Davis was an 82-m.p.h. fastball. I could tell he was 
struggling for two or three innings. He was staying back, he couldn't put any 
pressure (on his foot)." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan didn't protest when pitching coach Ron Perranoski came out and summoned 
Tim Crews, who finished the inning by striking out Davis. Ray Searage and Jay 
Howell also did their part in lowering the Dodger staff's earned-run average on 
this homestand to 1.03 on eight earned runs in 70 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first pitch had nothing on it, in a 1-0 game and Eric Davis up 
there, you can't (fool around)," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger lead expanded in the bottom of the sixth when Willie Randolph led 
off with a ground-rule double, advanced to third on Dave Anderson's sacrifice 
and scored on Mike Marshall's foul fly. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 2-0, and Eddie Murray, who walked, eventually came around to score 
on singles by Mickey Hatcher and John Shelby, despite narrowly avoiding being 
picked off second by Red loser Tom Browning. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Murray was caught but in the view of second-base umpire Gary Darling 
somehow avoided second baseman Ron Oester's tag. 
</P>
<P>
"He was out," Rose said matter-of-factly. "What happened there is Murray fell 
asleep. I'm just going by what Murray said to Lee May (the Reds' first-base 
coach and longtime friend of Murray). 
</P>
<P>
"When you get caught off that far, you should be out, even if he did miss the 
tag. The high throw made (Darling) call him safe. That's the kind of night it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of night when the teams combined for a grand total of 11 hits, 
with Morgan pitching out of his only serious jam in the second -- when three 
straight singles loaded the bases with one out. Morgan struck out Oester with a 
fastball running away, then retired Browning on a sharp ground-out. 
</P>
<P>
"We miss their best two pitchers, Hershiser and Leary, and we get shut out 
twice after not being shut out all year," Rose said. "That's unexpected from my 
standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the averages on both teams, a lot of guys are struggling, a lot 
of guys have .195's, most guys are hitting under their career averages." 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers, with a league-low batting average of .216, still took two of 
three from the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"If we keep getting pitching like that," Dempsey said, "we'll be right back in 
the race." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson sat out again Wednesday night, the fourth time in the last five 
games he has not started. . . . A big league name, but does he have a big 
league arm?: Timber Mead, who plays for the Reds' Class AA farm club in 
Chattanooga, was named Southern League pitcher of the week. . . . The Dodgers 
are off today, then will open a three-game homestand against the San Francisco 
Giants Friday night. Orel Hershiser (2-1) is scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers 
against Kelly Downs (1-1). . . . This is the second straight season that Eric 
Davis has started slowly. The Reds' outfielder, who had one infield single in 
10 at-bats here, hit .179 last April. He's down to .200 (11 for 55) this 
season.

EDITOR'S NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will retire after this season at 42, ending a 
remarkable career in the National Basketball Assn. He was planning to retire at 
40 but changed his mind and returned for two more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two seasons have generated a great deal of comment, positive and 
negative, on his decision, an indication that fans are deeply interested in 
when, and how, great athletes retire. 
</P>
<P>
 In this story, Bob Oates explores how some famous athletes feel about it. 
</P>
<P>
As his Oklahoma friends observed the other day, cattle rancher Warren Spahn was 
a National League diamond star when he bought this place, the Diamond Star 
ranch here in Pittsburg County, 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A left-handed pitcher, he was then in the midst of a Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Spahn, whose home base in the southeastern corner of the state 
is a spread of 2,800 acres, pitched 363 winning games in the big leagues, most 
of them for the old Milwaukee Braves. 
</P>
<P>
No other southpaw has ever been that successful. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no other pitcher alive today won that often. 
</P>
<P>
And when his career was winding down, no other player was more reluctant to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're still playing baseball in your 40s, you feel like the whole world is 
pressuring you to quit," said Spahn, who in 1968 pitched his last game -- a 
minor league game -- at the age of 47. 
</P>
<P>
He had been displaced in the majors three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that traumatic period, Spahn, a 20-game winner 13 times in his 21 
major league seasons, said: "The news people and everyone else kept asking: 
'Isn't it time for you to go?' 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude was, 'Drop dead, this is my life.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been my own person -- and every season I felt like I could still 
pitch. I wouldn't let anyone tell me that I couldn't. I had to be convinced in 
my own mind's eye -- and that time never came." 
</P>
<P>
It was his extraordinary consistency that gave Spahn that kind of confidence. 
He's the only pitcher who has had league-leading earned-run averages in three 
different decades -- 2.33 in 1947, 2.10 in 1953, and 3.02 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
And at 68, Spahn swears that if any team would have him now, he would still get 
a few hitters out. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the life of a ballplayer," he said. "The only thing I disliked -- the 
only thing I've ever regretted -- was the end of the baseball season, any 
season. Even today, I wouldn't (voluntarily) retire." 
</P>
<P>
ONE LAST SWING 
</P>
<P>
The case of Hall of Famer Ted Williams could hardly be more different. The 
game's last .400 hitter announced his retirement at age 42 and then went out 
and walloped a home run in his last time at bat. 
</P>
<P>
He and Spahn were contemporary major leaguers in 1960 -- a big year for both -- 
when Williams, a Boston Red Sox outfielder, decided to go out at the top. 
</P>
<P>
From his home in north central Florida recently, called to the telephone 
between tennis matches, Williams, 70, said: "The (1960) Sox weren't that good a 
club, (but) I wasn't getting any encouragement to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept reading in the papers that old guys like me were keeping the youngsters 
from coming up. 
</P>
<P>
"So I told myself, 'I'll make it easy for them. I'll go.' " 
</P>
<P>
After one last swing. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, I was getting fed up with everything but hitting," said 
Williams, a player who batted left and threw right. "(Although) I'd always had 
great enthusiasm for baseball, I didn't have that old zing anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still love to have hit. But the (game) and other things, the (travel), 
were getting harder for me. 
</P>
<P>
"That very fall, the (New York) Yankees wanted me as a pinch-hitter. I knew I'd 
only have to pinch hit. It didn't interest me." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who played 19 years in the majors, has been called baseball's best 
hitter since Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
With 514 home runs and a lifetime batting average of .344, Williams is in the 
top 10 on both lists. He's the only player who is, except Ruth, who had 714 
home runs and a .342 lifetime average. 
</P>
<P>
And, like Spahn, Williams has no regrets about the way it all ended. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, I might have played one more year for the money," Williams said. 
"(In 1960) I was getting the best salary in the league, but there's a 
difference between $125,000 and $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"For 2.2, I think I'd have put it together once more. But only once." 
</P>
<P>
'I COULD STILL PITCH' 
</P>
<P>
In the post-baseball world they share in different regions of the country, 
Spahn and Williams are similar in one or two respects. Both are distinguished 
senior citizens who are much in demand for personal appearances. And both have 
put on a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In other respects, they're as different now as they were then, when Williams 
was a tall, thin hitter, 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds, and Spahn was slight for a 
heavy-duty pitcher, standing under 6 feet and weighing about 170 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Spahn is still an outgoing sort whose number is in the Hartshorne 
telephone book. Williams, as introverted as he seemed in his American League 
days, can be traced sometimes now, but not easily. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing about them, however, is as different as the way they left baseball -- 
Spahn lingering, Williams leaping. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, each celebrated his 42nd year with a career-best before suddenly, 
and unexpectedly, plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
The log: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spahn, at 42, led the league in complete games in 1963 and matched his best 
record, 23-7. Then at 43, he tumbled to 6-13. At 44, with the New York Mets and 
San Francisco Giants, he was 7-16. And at 45, he was in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Williams, at 42, batted .316 in 1960 and hit more home runs -- 29 -- than 
he had at any time in the 1950s except 1951, when he had 30, and 1957, when he 
had 38. As he said: "I had more home runs per times at bat (in 1960) than I hit 
in any other year." Even so, after one last big swing, Williams was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Spahn's exit seems the more painful. In 1964 he was still basking in the glow 
of his 23-7 the year before when, all of a sudden, he couldn't win for losing. 
</P>
<P>
Those were times when the Braves were either changing or getting ready to 
change owners, managers, everyday players, pitchers and even communities, and, 
needing money, they unloaded the stars who made Milwaukee famous -- Del 
Crandall, Johnny Logan, Bob Buhl, Lew Burdette and others. 
</P>
<P>
After Spahn lost a few with the club's cheap new cast, the Braves exiled him to 
the bullpen -- a 20-game winner only a few months before, the greatest pitcher 
they ever had. 
</P>
<P>
The average 43-year-old player with a Hall of Fame warrant, his place in 
history secure, would have taken the hint and retired. 
</P>
<P>
Not Spahn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a miserable time -- for all of us -- with all the changes," he said. 
"But I felt like I could still pitch." 
</P>
<P>
His life got more miserable a year later when the Braves traded him to the 
last-place Mets, one of the worst sports teams of all time. 
</P>
<P>
The average old Hall of Fame pitcher would have taken that hint. 
</P>
<P>
Not Spahn. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't believe this, but I told myself, 'I can win with the Mets,' " he 
said. "I felt like I could still pitch." 
</P>
<P>
When his record fell to 4-12, Met General Manager George Weiss called him in, 
and, Spahn said, advised him: "Retire, boy." 
</P>
<P>
"Not me," Spahn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you're gone," said Weiss, who traded him to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
That was in the summer of 1965, when, as a relief pitcher for the Giants, he 
finished 3-4. The next spring, the Giants wouldn't even give him a contract. 
</P>
<P>
In the minors in 1966, '67 and '68, as a pitching coach and manager, Spahn took 
the mound himself just often enough to delay his Hall of Fame eligibility for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Three years. 
</P>
<P>
That was Spahn's way. 
</P>
<P>
This was Williams' way: 
</P>
<P>
One damp, windy afternoon at Fenway Park in the early fall of 1960, Williams, 
facing Baltimore right-hander Jack Fisher, demonstrated his continuing mastery 
of his difficult specialty with three left-handed shots to the same place in 
deepest right center, the last of which went out after the wind had stopped the 
first two. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked into the clubhouse, stripped off his uniform for the last time, 
and said, "That's all." 
</P>
<P>
A PAIR OF OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
For both Spahn and Williams, World War II ended in 1946. Each lost three 
baseball seasons to military service, Spahn in the Army and Williams as a 
Marine flyer. Williams also missed parts of two seasons in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves were still a Boston team in July, when Spahn reported in mint 
condition and won four games, then asked for permission to get married. 
</P>
<P>
He told the team that he met an Oklahoma girl while stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
"You're pitching Friday," the Braves said. "You can have Saturday off, but be 
back Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Compliantly, Spahn won his fifth straight start on Friday, took the next day 
off to be wed and returned in time to throw a home run ball Sunday, losing in 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, it was a great weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a ballplayer, Spahn, to hear him tell it, never knew anything but great 
weekends. Thus at the end, he hung on with steadily depleting skills. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Williams had a lot left when he left. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the better way to go, on top, or sliding? 
</P>
<P>
Good athletes have only those two options. 
</P>
<P>
Is one way better than the other? 
</P>
<P>
Many commentators think so. The fading superstar is a ripe subject for 
criticism and often ridicule by sports fans and media people. 
</P>
<P>
These groups had a field day with, for instance, Willie Mays, another Hall of 
Famer who slipped noticeably in the early '70s, but kept hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
One result of such criticism is that it breeds anxiety in other athletes, who 
tend to overvalue the fault-finding and dogmatic opinions of total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt of Philadelphia, the peerless but aging third baseman, is among 
the latest to be so plagued. 
</P>
<P>
Worrying more about what other people might think than about his own 
enchantment with the game, Schmidt, who at 39 finished on the injury list a 
year ago, dreads overstaying his time in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"(Fans) look back and remember Willie Mays dying on the vine for the Mets," 
Schmidt said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"It took them 10 years to get over that and remember that he was one of the 
greatest to ever play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not want people to look back on me and think I was dying on the vine." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the sentiment of most superstars -- of Bjorn Borg, for 
instance. The Swedish tennis champion retired rich but prematurely several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And, clearly, it was Williams' sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
But there's another one. 
</P>
<P>
As Mays and Spahn both suggest, a case can be made for playing a professional 
sport for as many years -- or as many months, or days -- "as any employer will 
have you," in Spahn's phrase. 
</P>
<P>
The reasoning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Playing big league games is simply more fun than anything else you're 
likely to do the rest your life. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In your 40s, you have the option of playing or retiring. In your 50s, when 
you may desperately wish to come back, you can't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never quit when there's any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Mays summed it up one day when he confessed: "All I ever wanted was to play 
baseball forever." 
</P>
<P>
BILLIE JEAN'S WAY 
</P>
<P>
Billie Jean King, the tennis champion who not long ago was winning a record 20 
Wimbledon titles, put another spin on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
She asked: "What's good enough? If you're the fifth- or eighth- or 10th-best 
brain surgeon in the world, should you quit? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
In a baseball context, should Schmidt quit when he slips from No. 1 to become 
the fifth-or eighth- or 10th-best third baseman in the world? 
</P>
<P>
King, speaking from her home in Chicago, said: "My point is just that Mike 
should do what he wants to do. Every person should listen to herself or himself 
(on retirement) and nobody else. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to play (competitively), and think you can handle it, I say why 
not? If you don't want it, don't do it -- but you be the judge of that." 
</P>
<P>
The only other judges who count, King said, are the sports promoters and 
executives who have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if nobody wants you, you're out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's only a myth that champions have to go out on top. That's just other 
people trying to make up your mind for you." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980s competitive tennis, King held her own against younger players until 
she was 40, when she took over as commissioner and then chief executive officer 
of Domino's TeamTennis, whose season resumes July 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennis is the sport of a lifetime," King said. "But in competition, older 
players always have to pay a (physical) price to keep up with kids. It's worth 
it, if you love the game." 
</P>
<P>
Warmly approving Spahn's approach to retirement, King is also uniquely able to 
understand Williams'. For she left competitive sports herself after winning at 
Wimbledon in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was too late, she came back to revel in a competitive career that 
lasted until 1983, when, at 39, she reached the semifinals at Wimbledon one 
last time. 
</P>
<P>
"(In 1976) I could still have won Wimbledon," King said. "I made a mistake when 
I quit (in 1975). I was listening to other people, trying to make them happy, 
instead of myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure to read (Sen.) Bill Bradley's book (on life in the (National 
Basketball Assn.) on how to age gracefully on the job. You only have a complete 
career when you feel how it is to go all the way up, and all the way down." 
</P>
<P>
Spahn, the 363-game winner who embarrassingly lost 16 in his final year in the 
majors, knows exactly how it feels, King said. For Spahn also won seven times 
that last year. 
</P>
<P>
He tasted the last drop, won the last game that was in him, struck out the last 
man he could. He got the last thrill -- not the next-to-last nor the 
50th-from-last, but the last. 
</P>
<P>
If Spahn's longing to stay in baseball cost him three years in the Hall of 
Fame, King said, "I've heard him say: 'You can't pitch in the Hall of Fame.' " 
</P>
<P>
THE OLD COWHAND 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago on the Diamond Star Ranch, a norther swept down on Oklahoma 
one February day -- as often happens -- and turned the landscape into a frigid 
wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
That morning, in other words, it was even colder and more bleak and melancholy 
out there than usual. 
</P>
<P>
But Spahn's cattle still had to be fed, and as the only adult male on the 
premises, Spahn was elected. 
</P>
<P>
He got up, went out, and did it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, feeding 400 or 500 head on an Oklahoma cattle ranch isn't like feeding the 
cat. You don't just set out a few saucers of milk. You lift 50-pound sacks of 
corn and 68-pound bales of hay into a truck and ferry them down a rutty road to 
the cows' wind-swept cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
There, either before or after cleaving the stiff wire that holds the bags 
together, you lift one out at a time, throw the feed around, and say, "Come and 
get it, girls." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, that is, you did. Today they have fork lifts and other 
labor-saving equipment. But in the days when Spahn was winning 20 games a year 
for the Braves, year after year, he spent the off-season throwing 50-pound 
sacks and 68-pound bales in and out of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
There was just one good thing about it, Spahn said: "I stayed in perfect 
physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so ready that in 21 years (in the majors), I never had a sore arm." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is more discomfiting to a pitcher than that. Nothing, in fact, is more 
discouraging to professional athletes than injuries, which happen more often to 
out-of-condition men and women than to others. 
</P>
<P>
Spahn was continually upbeat because he was continually in shape. And it was 
his good health, his physical well-being, he said, that prompted his enthusiasm 
for baseball -- which was so much a part of him that he could never bear to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, there had been less reason for optimism. His father was a 
Buffalo wallpaper salesman who in the Great Depression supported four daughters 
and two sons on $27 a week. 
</P>
<P>
During high school, Spahn preferred the swimming team to baseball, but gave it 
up when he found that Class D baseball paid $50 a week and the Olympics 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Overtaken by World War II, he rose to staff sergeant in the Army and then to 
second and first lieutenant when commissioned on the battlefield in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
His only child, Gregory, is a Tulsa realtor with two daughters. Spahn has a 
second home there in the suburb of Broken Arrow, about 100 miles north of 
Hartshorne. 
</P>
<P>
Father and son belong to two country clubs, and "sometimes play golf all week," 
one Oklahoma friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Jointly, father and son own the corporation that owns the Diamond Star ranch, 
which was so named by Spahn's wife, LoRene, who died in 1978. She persuaded him 
to buy his first 60 acres here in her home county. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch now rolls for 3 1/2 miles along a graveled old wagon trail -- grandly 
renamed Savage Highway -- and extends picturesquely into the distant foothills. 
Today a foreman is responsible for Spahn's 500 cows. 
</P>
<P>
His rambling ranch house has every modern convenience, including an indoor 
swimming pool. The largest oil painting in the living room is an artist's 
interpretation of Milwaukee County Stadium, where he won so many of his 363 
games. 
</P>
<P>
That brought up a discussion about Spahn's stamina, as demonstrated there and 
elsewhere. He held a big league peak for two decades. His 13 years as a 20-game 
winner are second only to Cy Young's 16. 
</P>
<P>
In an incredible streak at the end of his career, from age 36 to 42, Spahn led 
the National League in complete games for seven straight years. 
</P>
<P>
How could an arm go through all that -- after all the pitches it made in 
earlier years -- without falling off? "No pitcher can hurt himself if he uses 
the proper mechanics," Spahn said. "The arm is the last to go, if you treat it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
He considers hyper-extension the worst threat. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to keep the elbow bent at all times, on the hardest throws," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most guys today don't pitch properly, and one problem is the speed gun, which 
is the worst invention of all time. They think all they have to do is throw it 
95 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys with the good mechanics are (Dwight) Gooden, (Roger) Clemens, (Nolan) 
Ryan and (Orel) Hershiser. There are possibly a few others, but most of the 
pitchers you see today won't have very long careers." 
</P>
<P>
He said proper mechanics means, first, using both arms as the ball is pitched. 
Second, it means keeping the elbow in front of the body and above the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching is a front-handed game, like golf or tennis or hitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, good mechanics means pulling down on the ball to release it. "Don't 
cast it," he said. "Pitching is like cracking a whip. You get leverage from 
your other arm." 
</P>
<P>
Between seasons, ranch work also helps. 
</P>
<P>
And the Diamond Star is an idyllic place to sit out the off-season, he said. If 
you have to sit it out somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Provided you don't have to feed the cattle. 
</P>
<P>
THE PERFECTIONIST 
</P>
<P>
Ted Williams agrees with Billie Jean King today on one thing -- that tennis is, 
at the least, one of the two best games in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets about leaving baseball when I did," Williams said from his 
home in Hernando, Florida. "But I deeply regret not playing tennis as a young 
man, particularly as a ballplayer. It's a great second sport for a (pro 
athlete). I'm playing two or three times a week now -- singles, mostly. I'd 
rather play singles than doubles. And I hit at least 100 (tennis) balls every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
At 70, Williams said he has lost some of his zest for fishing. Instead he plays 
both golf and tennis regularly with his son, John Henry, a student at the 
University of Maine, or with friends at the Florida residential development 
with which he is associated. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone loves to play golf with Ted," one Florida friend said, requesting 
that her name be withheld. "This is a golf development, you know. And Ted is 
just a wonderful man. The strange thing is that he attacks tennis the way he 
attacked baseball -- but when he gets on a golf course, he relaxes totally. 
He'll do anything to make it pleasant for his (golf) foursome. In tennis, he'll 
do anything to win." 
</P>
<P>
His closest friend, Bud Leavit of Bangor, Me., is a veteran newspaperman who 
said that what Williams likes about golf, tennis or fishing is simply being 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see Ted making a (baseball) living in one of those domes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leavit, who has become a national authority on fishing since first associating 
with Williams, was with him 30 years ago when, unbeknown to most people, the 
only .400 hitter of his era was beginning to think seriously of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be fishing in Alaska or somewhere, and Ted would be silent for a long 
time," Leavit said. "Then out of the blue, he'd say, 'Hell, it's about time I 
hung it up.' 
</P>
<P>
"He never said why, but if you know him, you don't have to ask. You know why he 
left: Ted is a perfectionist who just can't stand mediocrity. He's that way 
about fishing, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd just never let himself be remembered as an old ballplayer who hung around 
after his time." 
</P>
<P>
Leavit was Williams' guest in Boston on the day of the last home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd told him about a young fellow who broke his neck playing football," the 
writer said. "And Ted said, 'Bring him down for a game next week.' Four of us 
drove down, and he got us seats in a box behind the dugout. He ripped three 
that day, you know. He should have had three home runs. He came over and told 
us to meet him immediately afterward at his hotel, the Somerset Hotel. So Ted 
spent his last day in baseball with three guys from Bangor and a paraplegic." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox superstar who hit .388 in 1957 -- after having hit .406 in 1941 -- 
had spent his first day in baseball in San Diego, where his father was a 
professional photographer with a shop on Fifth Avenue, near the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a good high school pitcher," Williams said. "I could pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"And I could hit." 
</P>
<P>
Could he hit!

</P>
<P>
IN 3 PLAYOFF GAMES, THEY'VE TURNED 1-GOAL LEADS INTO 4-3 DEFEATS

Beware the 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
For the Kings, a 3-2 lead has a way of turning ugly. It starts out looking 
good, but it can't be trusted. It's two-faced. It's slippery. It's downright 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Three times in this National Hockey League playoff season, the Kings have had 
3-2 leads. Each time they've lost, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Three for three. 
</P>
<P>
They lost to the Edmonton Oilers that way in Game 1 of their Smythe Division 
semifinal series. They took only two shots on goal after Mike Krushelnyski gave 
them the 3-2 lead with more than 17 minutes to play. When they let the game get 
away, they said the good news was that they learned from it. 
</P>
<P>
They lost to the Oilers the same way, again, in Game 4. And they said that they 
did not mean to sit on a one-goal lead. But maybe they had. And they wouldn't 
let that happen again. 
</P>
<P>
But then they lost to the Calgary Flames in Game 1 of their Smythe Division 
final series Tuesday night after a one-goal lead. And they said that they 
understood the problem and they certainly wouldn't let it happen again. 
</P>
<P>
So what are the Kings going to do differently if they have the misfortune to 
take a 3-2 lead in Game 2 of their series against the Flames in the Saddledome 
tonight? 
</P>
<P>
Well, once again they are promising to think offense, to keep trying to score. 
After all, they scored more goals than any other team in the NHL this season. 
They finished fourth in the overall standings -- one point out of third place 
-- by scoring goals. 
</P>
<P>
Before skating onto the ice for practice Wednesday afternoon, Wayne Gretzky 
himself was saying: "At playoff time, you can't change your system. You can't 
change your style." 
</P>
<P>
So who's telling the Kings to change their style midway through these playoff 
games? The coach? 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly the opposite," Gretzky said. "Unfortunately, the coach has taken some 
heat for those losses. . . . But it's just human nature to not want to be out 
there when they get that third goal." 
</P>
<P>
It would be possible to defend a defensive strategy in the situation the Kings 
faced Tuesday night. There are precedents and truisms to be cited. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, playoff games are usually more defensive and lower-scoring than 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
For another, the Kings were almost able to pull it off. If they had held the 
Flames in check for only 96 more seconds, they would have won, 3-2. Then who 
would have second-guessed their play? 
</P>
<P>
And furthermore, there's something to be said for respecting the home-ice 
advantage of a team such as the Flames. Take a one-goal lead on their ice and 
don't get greedy. Just escape with it, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings couldn't defend their defensive strategy because they swear they 
didn't have one. There was no plan to play conservatively, they said. It just 
happened. The players got tentative on their own, each in his own mind. 
</P>
<P>
As Gretzky described the transformation that took place: "We were playing with 
fear of the fact that nobody wanted to take penalties. We've got to play hard 
and play physical. It if leads to penalties, we'll kill the penalties. We need 
to play with a great deal of aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to be the guy accused of being too offensive-minded or be the guy 
caught in too deep. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tiptoeing around, not wanting to be the guy who lets it go to 3-3." 
</P>
<P>
In Marty McSorley's analysis: "We were so obsessed with winning the game, we 
were willing to accept 3-2. . . . It's a subconscious thing. We were definitely 
on our heels. Earlier in the game, whenever we felt we needed a goal, we got a 
goal. But then we didn't seem to feel we needed to extend our lead. We need 
more of the killer instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"In the (regular) season, we were happy to win, 9-7. But the thought is that in 
the playoffs, you can't give up that many goals and win hockey games." 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski rejected the theory that playing to protect a lead is the same as 
"playing not to lose," an axiom considered to be the opposite of "playing to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "What we have been doing is playing not to let our teammates down. 
Instead of going for goals, we're thinking of helping out defensively. Maybe 
some of our players need to be a little bit more selfish." 
</P>
<P>
All of the Kings were puzzling over why their approach to the game seems to 
change once they get up, 3-2. Everyone was puzzling over why it has happened 
three times. And they insist it was not by design. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, we're trying to avoid that," John Tonelli said. "Sometimes it 
takes a couple of times to learn things." 
</P>
<P>
Herb Brooks, former college, Olympic and NHL coach, was asked for his theory. 
Brooks, who is working as a SportsChannel commentator covering the series, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an exact science, like football, where you can have a set plan for 
certain situations. When you lose the momentum, the human element comes in. The 
coach doesn't want it to happen, the players don't want it to happen. But it 
happens to all teams and all coaches from time to time. Nobody is exempt from 
losing momentum and losing the flow of the offense." To a crowd of reporters 
gathered around Gretzky, picking apart theories and agonizing over how the 
Kings let a game get away, Gretzky said: "When you lose a playoff game by one 
goal and everybody wants to know what's wrong with you, you know you've gained 
some respect." 
</P>
<P>
Word in the Kings' dressing room was that Tonelli will be taking regular shifts 
tonight with his regular line for the first time in this playoff season. After 
illness kept him out of the first four games, Tonelli was used sparingly -- 
"wisely" he said -- as the coaches brought him back slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli said Wednesday that he felt ready for regular shifts, but he would not 
confirm the plan to use him more. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that rumor is right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Correction: Tonelli, 32, was incorrectly referred to in a recent article as the 
oldest of the Kings. He isn't. Dave Taylor is, at 33. Taylor said that he 
understood how the mistake could be made. 
</P>
<P>
"I told John you probably meant to call him the oldest-looking," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Flame Coach Terry Crisp, on the shot by Tonelli in overtime that hit the 
crossbar so hard it ended up in the balcony seats: "I don't remember J.T. 
shooting a puck like that. Boy, he must have spent a lot of time in the weight 
room down there in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will be televised on Prime Ticket and broadcast by KGIL (1260) 
and KORG (1190). . . . If this series goes to Game 6, that game will be played, 
as originally scheduled, on Friday, April 28, at 7:30 p.m. There was a conflict 
with a possible Laker playoff game at the Forum that night, but apparently that 
game -- listed on the NBA's tentative playoff schedule as April 27 or April 28 
-- will now be played on Thursday, April 27. . . . X-rays of the bone under 
Doug Gilmour's eye were negative Tuesday night. Gilmour, who scored the winning 
goal for the Flames, was cut minutes earlier in the overtime by John Tonelli's 
stick.

NO. 2 STANFORD SWEEPS NO. 1 UCLA IN VOLLEYBALL, 15-7, 15-10, 15-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a battle between the top two volleyball teams in the nation, No. 2-ranked 
Stanford easily defeated top-ranked UCLA, 15-7, 15-10, 15-6, Wednesday night 
before 1,600 fans at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Cardinal, 20-5 overall, closed within a half-game of the 
Bruins in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. with a 15-3 record. UCLA 
fell to 16-3 in the league and 26-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Bruins defeated the Cardinal at Palo Alto, getting off to a fast 
start. This time, Stanford returned the favor, racing to a 7-1 lead in the 
first game before winning, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Our quick start set the tone of the match," Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said. 
"We were able to stay on top of them and not let them have too many 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford completely outhit, outblocked and outhustled the Bruins in a match 
that, according to Sturm, established Stanford as one of the top threats in the 
NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several teams that are capable of winning it all," Sturm said. "The 
top teams are UCLA, Pepperdine and us." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford used a balanced attack with middleblockers Scott Fortune and Dan Hanan 
leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, who finished with 20 kills, helped rally the Cardinal from a 10-6 
deficit in the second game by serving eight straight points. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to see their blockers better and see the holes in their defense," 
said Fortune, who also had seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
In the third game, Stanford again rallied after trailing, 5-3, outscoring UCLA, 
12-1. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford needs to win its last two matches, against Loyola and Pepperdine, to 
force a playoff with the Bruins, assuming that they beat USC Friday night in 
their final match. 
</P>
<P>
For Stanford, John Alstrom also had 20 kills, and Hanan added 18. UCLA was led 
by Trevor Schirman with 19 kills and Anthony Curci with 15.

ELSTER ERRORLESS IN 73 GAMES, A RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Elster set a major league record when he played his 73rd consecutive game 
at shortstop without making an error during the New York Mets' 4-2 victory over 
the Philadelphia Phillies Wednesday night in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Elster broke the record set by Eddie Brinkman of the Detroit Tigers from May 2 
to Aug. 4, 1972. The National League record was 68, set by Buddy Kerr with the 
New York Giants from July 28, 1946, to May 24, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr holds the major league mark of fielding 383 straight chances at shortstop 
without making an error. Brinkman holds the major league record of fielding the 
most chances in one season without making an error, 331.

PADRES BEAT GIANTS AGAIN, 4-3, AS JACK CLARK IS EJECTED AT CANDLESTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Giant Jack Clark's return to San Francisco might wind up in a suspension 
for the slugging first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, booed by fans in his first series at Candlestick Park since returning to 
the National League as a Padre, played a key factor in two consecutive San 
Diego victories. 
</P>
<P>
After the Giants battered the Padres, 9-0, in the opener Monday night, Clark 
hit a home run with a man on in the fourth inning Tuesday night in a 4-2 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, he walked with the bases loaded in the seventh inning to help give 
the Padres a 4-3 victory but wasn't around at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was ejected by plate umpire Bob Davidson in the eighth inning after 
Davidson called Benito Santiago out on strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said Clark shouted an obscenity from the dugout, but later John Kruk 
confessed that he did it. 
</P>
<P>
Clark charged toward home plate, threw dirt on the plate in a heated argument 
in which it appeared he bumped Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
"I said nothing," Clark claimed. "He should be an American League umpire. I 
guess he just picked someone out of the dugout. It could have cost us the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said: "Jack stood up, threw both hands up and yelled an obscenity. 
That's why I ejected him." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon said Davidson was wrong. But he was more upset by the 
attention the controversy received. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of talking about Santiago's three runs batted in and Mark Davis 
closing out the game, " McKeon said, "you guys (reporters) want to write 
negatively. Big deal. Guys get thrown out all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show went 7 2/3 innings to improve his record to 3-1. Davis got his 
seventh save in seven appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Giant reliever Craig Lefferts retired the Padres in order in the ninth and has 
set down 29 consecutive batters. The record is 41, set by Jim Barr of the 
Giants in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, St. Louis 5 -- Pretty soon they will have to stop calling it a 
"rare" error by Cardinal shortstop Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game at St. Louis, the shortstop considered 
baseball's best made an error to help the Pirates win. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Pirates scored the tying and winning runs with two out in 
the ninth when Smith fumbled a routine ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Smith's throwing error helped the Pirates put together a three-run 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates built a 7-1 lead going into the eighth behind Bob Walk (1-1), but 
the Cardinals rallied to make it close on a bases-loaded pinch triple by Johnny 
Morris. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, Philadelphia 2 -- A three-run pinch home run by Lee Mazzilli with 
two out in the eighth inning at New York enabled the Mets to pull this one out. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets appeared to be in danger of losing for the ninth time in 13 games when 
Steve Bedrosian, an outstanding relief pitcher, came in to protect a 2-1 lead 
with two out and a man on second in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian walked Howard Johnson, and Mazzilli followed with his fifth career 
pinch home run. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, Houston 3 -- With one swing at Atlanta, Dale Murphy regained some 
lost confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy hit a two-run single with two out in the eighth inning to give the 
Braves a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy entered the game with a .115 batting average and two runs batted in his 
first 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't done anything, so it feels good to help the cause," Murphy said. 
"It's one game but it helped the confidence a little." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Chicago 2 -- The Cubs went into Montreal riding a seven-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
When Tom Foley and Nelson Santovenia hit consecutive homers in the eighth 
inning, the Cubs left town with a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The home runs gave Dennis Martinez, who allowed eight hits before needing help 
in the ninth, his first victory since last Aug. 24. DAN HAFNER

VIOLA AGREES TO 3-YEAR, $7.9-MILLION CONTRACT, THEN LOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the reasons given to explain Frank Viola's poor start this season was a 
bitter contract-extension battle with the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few hours after agreeing to terms for a three-year, $7.9-million 
contract -- similar terms to those recently negotiated by the Dodgers' Orel 
Hershiser -- Viola made his fourth start. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, one of baseball's best left-handers, improved considerably but still was 
a little short. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs from his first victory, Viola gave up a single to Keith Moreland, and 
then Matt Nokes hit a two-run home run to give the Detroit Tigers a 3-2 
victory, only their second in the last 15 games against the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Viola rejected the Twins' $7.9-million offer. Then, he decided to 
accept it. But General Manager Andy MacPhail, angered by the "havoc and 
turmoil," withdrew the offer. Wednesday, owner Carl Pohlad became involved and 
reinstated the original offer, which Viola accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, who won the AL Cy Young Award last season when he was 24-7 with a 2.64 
earned-run average, went into Wednesday night's game with a 6.88 ERA. Although 
he lowered it, he is 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 7, Seattle 5 -- Dave Stewart is off to a running start toward his third 
consecutive 20-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
There are three main reasons why the former Dodger, the ace of the Oakland 
Athletics, is the majors' first four-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
First, it's April; second, Dennis Eckersley, one of the game's best relievers 
is around to bail him out, and, finally, the Seattle Mariners are his favorite 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart didn't exactly pitch a gem at Seattle. But Eckersley was there to get 
the final out. He has four saves, three coming in games Stewart has won. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has developed a knack for pitching just good enough to win -- 
especially in April. He gave up eight hits and four runs, then put the first 
runner on in the seventh. He departed with a 7-3 lead, and four relievers made 
it stand up. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a strong-armed right-hander, was 6-0 last April and has won his last 
13 decisions in April. He still has two more starts this month. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Mariners have difficulties against Stewart. He has nine consecutive 
victories over Seattle and is 10-2 in his career against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
It's somewhat surprising that Stewart is 4-0 and the A's are 10-6. Oakland has 
been playing without power hitters Jose Canseco all season and Mark McGwire for 
most of it. 
</P>
<P>
The A's have to scratch and battle for runs. Terry Steinbach drove in three 
runs off Seattle's best pitcher, Mark Langston, and Billy Beane, called up to 
replace McGwire, went 2 for 3 and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, Toronto 2 -- If they could spend more time in Toronto, the Yankees 
probably could reach first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
But the Yankees, who swept the three-game series in their favorite park, 
Exhibition Stadium, won't return until early August. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran left-hander John Candelaria gave up four hits in seven innings to 
improve his record to 2-1. He gave the Yankees their third consecutive 
well-pitched game. The Blue Jays managed only four runs and 20 hits in the 
three games against a pitching staff that, going into the series, had the worst 
ERA in the league at 6.17. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees jumped on loser Jimmy Key (2-2) for three runs with two out in the 
fourth. Don Slaught started the rally with a triple. After a walk, Tom 
Brookens, Alvaro Espinoza and Roberto Kelly drove in runs with hits. 
</P>
<P>
"This sweep should improve our outlook," said Candelaria, who got his 1,500th 
strikeout. "When you do that against a club as good as Toronto, it has to make 
you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Milwaukee 1 -- The Rangers' power attack prevailed again at Arlington, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia, Julio Franco and Ruben Sierra hit home runs as the Rangers 
improved to 12-2. Jamie Moyer, a refugee from the National League, raised his 
record to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer allowed Gary Sheffield's 402-foot home run in the second inning. He gave 
up four other hits in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia's home run, which came with Franco on base in the sixth inning, 
traveled 425 feet. Incaviglia also hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth to put the 
Rangers ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 8, Cleveland 4 -- Nick Esasky went 4 for 4, including a two-run home 
run, at Cleveland to help Roger Clemens win on an off night. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is 11-1 against the Indians, Clemens (2-0) lasted seven innings, 
giving up eight hits and three runs and striking out three. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 6, Kansas City 5 -- Phil Bradley's two-run single climaxed a four-run 
sixth-inning rally at Baltimore that enabled the Orioles to pull out another 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals had taken a 3-2 lead in the sixth when Bo Jackson hit a three-run 
homer. It was Jackson's fourth home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the Orioles' second victory over the Royals in the last 18 games.

ESTANCIA HAS TUSTIN'S NUMBER, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Gary Burrows, the No. 9 hitter in Estancia High School's batting 
order, there's really no secret to hitting Tustin's ace pitcher, Monte Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws the ball with an even rotation," Burrows said. "I like hitting 
against him because you can see the pitch right off his hand." 
</P>
<P>
Burrows showed just how to hit Jones in the bottom of the seventh inning on 
Wednesday, lining a one-out single that scored teammate Mark Hartley to give 
Estancia a 1-0 victory in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Estancia (13-5, 6-2) into a first-place tie with Tustin 
(11-7, 6-2) in the Sea View League and avenged an earlier 1-0 loss to Jones 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia's Gabe Javage (6-1) allowed five hits and gave up only a intentional 
walk. Jones (6-1), the county's strikeout leader, walked five and struck out 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
Jones had allowed only two hits entering the seventh when Hartley reached on an 
error by Tustin second baseman Chris Varvarinecz with one out. Hartley stole 
second and then moved to third on a wild pitch by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Burrows worked Jones to a 3-2 count and then lined a fastball to the gap in 
left-center field that easily scored Hartley for the winning run. Burrows had 
two of Estancia's three hits, matching his output the last time he faced Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I like hitting against him. . . . I like hitting against Tustin," Burrows 
said. "He threw me a fastball right down the middle. I guess he didn't want to 
walk me and load the bases." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Brown, Tustin's coach, said he called for a fastball, admitting he didn't 
want to walk Estancia's No. 9 hitter to load the bases with the leadoff hitter 
coming to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to get him out with a fastball," Brown said. "Monte struggled 
today. I think we was pressing and trying to be too fine. You just saw two 
teams who wanted to get the win real badly." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin blew its best scoring opportunity in the top of the seventh. First 
baseman Erik Grove led off the inning with a base hit and was replaced by pinch 
runner Kevin Jurkowski. 
</P>
<P>
Jurkowski moved to second on a sacrifice and then went to third on a passed 
ball. But Jurkowski was left stranded at third when Varvarinecz struck out and 
teammate Bill Filbert grounded out on a fine play by Estancia shortstop Jason 
White. 
</P>
<P>
In another Sea View League game: 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 6, University 3 -- Mike Arroyos (4-3) pitched six innings and Frank 
Fonseca worked the final inning for the save for host Saddleback (5-3, 9-8). 
J.J. Fejeran had three hits and scored two runs, and Jeff Blanco had two hits 
and four RBIs including a three-run double in the sixth, for Saddleback.

Troy Kopp pitched a two-hitter and Don Disbro hit two home runs and had six 
runs batted in Wednesday to lead Mission Viejo High School to a 7-0 South Coast 
League baseball victory at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted Mission Viejo (12-5 overall, 5-3 in league play) into a tie 
for second place with El Toro (13-6) with seven games to play. Both teams are 
one game behind Capistrano Valley (13-6, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be in the race where we are," Mission Viejo Coach Ron Drake said. 
"We lost two games last week to a pretty good ballclub (Capistrano Valley), and 
it was nice to see the kids respond the way they did today." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro starter Rob Johnson (6-2), who pitched five innings, started the game 
by walking Jon Hayes. Hayes then stole second and went to third when Kopp's 
one-out grounder went under third baseman Scott Sebo's glove for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Disbro gave the Diablos a 3-0 lead with a home run over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Disbro, who extended Mission Viejo's lead to 4-0 with a run-scoring single in 
the fourth, highlighted a three-run fifth inning with a two-run homer. One out 
later, Jeff Hawkins closed out the scoring with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
"(Disbro) did a good job of hitting on both his home runs," said El Toro Coach 
Dan DeLeon, whose team committed five errors. "He hit a mistake pitch on his 
first homer and timed a fastball on his second homer. We didn't do a good job 
of competing on the field and the kid (Kopp) did a good job of mixing his 
pitches and changing speeds to keep us off balance." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp (6-3), who didn't walk a batter, gave up hits in the first and second 
innings. After that, the only El Toro baserunners came on Mission Viejo errors 
in the fourth and fifth innings and a hit batter in the third. AL PRESTON

PICKENS DENIES DEAL IN JAPAN IS A HOSTILE MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TOKYO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
T. Boone Pickens Jr., the Texas oilman and corporate raider, made a dramatic 
but inconclusive debut before the Japanese business world Wednesday, declaring 
that his not-so-friendly acquisition of a major stake in a Japanese auto parts 
maker was not a hostile takeover bid or an attempt at "greenmail." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese financial and corporate circles have been apprehensive since it was 
disclosed at the beginning of the month that Pickens' merchant bank, Boone Co., 
had bought a block of shares from a Japanese stock speculator to obtain a 20.2% 
stake in Koito Manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Koito makes automobile headlamps and is closely affiliated with Toyota Motor, 
which previously was its largest shareholder, with 19.8% of outstanding shares. 
More than 60% of Koito's stock is tightly held by Japanese firms, and the Boone 
stock purchase, valued at about $800 million, has been viewed with deep 
suspicion by analysts in Tokyo. They have surmised that Pickens will attempt a 
greenmail maneuver -- dropping a takeover bid in exchange for a premium price 
for the shares he has acquired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, meeting foreign and Japanese reporters in a luncheon and two separate 
news conferences Wednesday, denied that he had any such intentions. But he left 
people guessing about the real motives behind the deal, which is widely 
believed here to be the beginning of the first direct, hostile acquisition of a 
Japanese company by a foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
Portraying himself as a champion of shareholders' rights whose aim is to 
promote U.S.-Japanese economic relations, Pickens said he plans to adopt the 
role of a "long-term shareholder" and hopes to participate in the management of 
Koito. 
</P>
<P>
"Koito is an excellent company with a bright future, and we believe we can 
contribute to that future," Pickens said. "We are not hostile in any way, and 
all we want to do is work with Koito management." 
</P>
<P>
Koito, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and had a profit of about 
$55 million on sales of $803 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1988, 
had initially refused to register Boone Co. as a share owner. It demanded a 
probe of whether Boone Co. made the proper legal filings with the Finance 
Ministry when it obtained its shares. 
</P>
<P>
But Koito relented Wednesday, announcing that it would register the stock 
transfer and agreeing to a meeting this morning between the company's 
president, Takao Matsuura, and Pickens, who arrived in Japan on Tuesday. The 
company remained guarded, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know what his intentions are until we meet with him and discuss the 
matter," said Shinji Hagiwara, a Koito spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Junsuke Kato told reporters that he hopes Boone Co. will become 
a "stable shareholder." 
</P>
<P>
Pickens declined to elaborate on the business strategy he would unveil to Koito 
management, but he said he thought Koito should expand its exports to Europe 
and the United States and diversify out of the automotive industry. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Boone Co., based in Amarillo, Tex., has yet to assume the 
role of a long-term shareholder or to participate in the management of any 
other company, U.S. or foreign, since it was formed in 1986. Pickens has 
acquired a reputation as an aggressive corporate raider as a principal of Mesa 
L. P., an oil and gas company that made a bold attempt to take over Gulf Oil in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts say the only other postwar example of a foreign concern 
attempting to seize control of a major stake in a Japanese company was in 1985, 
when a joint venture between Trafalgar Holdings of Los Angeles and Britain's 
Glen International cashed in warrants, accumulated on the Eurobond market, for 
equity in Minebea, a leading ball bearing maker. Their takeover bid was 
deflected when Minebea persuaded friendly companies to buy out the foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens' philosophy of shareholder rights and management participation flies in 
the face of established practices in Japan, whereby companies generally pay 
minimal dividends and focus on long-term growth strategies. 
</P>
<P>
But Pickens said such practices will soon be outmoded as the world's stock 
markets become increasingly linked in global trading. He hinted that there 
might be political fallout should foreign investors be denied reciprocal 
opportunities in Japan's markets. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is being followed very closely in the United States, not only 
from an economic standpoint, but from a political standpoint," he said.

PANEL WANTS MERC TO REVAMP SOME TRADING POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday recommended 
several sweeping reforms designed to curb trading abuses, increase public 
confidence and soften attempts by Congress to impose tougher regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reforms, which must be approved by the exchange's board of 
governors, as expected include a partial ban on "dual trading," the 
controversial practice whereby brokers trade for their own personal accounts as 
well as for client accounts, creating a possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals also include steps to increase floor surveillance, stiffen 
penalties for violations of exchange rules, ban certain trading between members 
of the same broker group and include outsiders on exchange disciplinary 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Praise 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations by the nine-member panel, which includes six individuals 
who are not members of the Merc, came three months after the committee was 
formed amid reports that an FBI undercover investigation had found numerous 
trading abuses at Chicago futures exchanges that may have cheated customers out 
of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms appear to be the most sweeping proposed by any futures exchange 
since news of that FBI probe fueled congressional and public outcries for 
greater controls on the fast-growing but relatively unregulated markets. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms immediately met with general praise from market experts, regulators 
and congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The report reflects the way industry self-regulation is supposed to work, 
responding in a meaningful way to market situations and issues that arise in 
the futures trading environment," Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman 
Wendy Lee Gramm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
However, an aide for Rep. Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.), chairman of the House 
Agriculture Committee, which oversees the futures markets, said the proposed 
reforms will not derail congressional efforts to explore tougher laws on the 
markets. The exchanges have successfully fought off repeated attempts to 
tighten regulation in the past, most recently after the 1987 stock market 
crash. But new measures are expected to be proposed this year when Congress 
considers legislation to reauthorize the CFTC. 
</P>
<P>
While De la Garza commended the Merc committee for its effort, "that in no way 
affects the committee's responsibility to go forward to look at whether 
statutes and regulation are adequate to make sure everybody is on a level 
playing field," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and industry leaders also stopped short of predicting whether the 
proposed reforms will be accepted and adopted enthusiastically by the 
exchange's board and its broker-dealer members. Added surveillance and other 
controls will increase costs assessed to members. And although many customers 
and legislators criticize dual trading for allowing brokers to put their own 
trades ahead of those of clients, many brokers contend that dual trading is 
essential to maintain adequate trading volume and member profits. 
</P>
<P>
"The floor doesn't have much of a choice. They're not going to like it, but 
they are going to buy it," said Thomas A. Russo, a commodities lawyer in New 
York and frequent Merc critic who currently has litigation pending against the 
exchange. "Now we have to watch and see how this gets implemented. You can have 
all the tools in the world, but if you don't have the will to implement, those 
tools and rules are useless." 
</P>
<P>
The Merc committee proposal stops short of banning dual trading completely. 
Instead, it is prohibited only in more actively traded futures contracts and 
contract months where the added volume of brokers' own trades is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
Futures contracts, the principal items traded on futures exchanges, are 
commitments to buy or sell a certain amount of an item at a certain price at a 
certain time. Dual trading already has been largely banned for major brokers 
trading the Merc's contract on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. 
</P>
<P>
Dual trading, however, will be allowed in less actively traded contracts and 
when customers give written permission. 
</P>
<P>
Other key recommendations of the panel include: 
</P>
<P>
* Banning members of a broker group from trading for their personal accounts 
against orders from members of the same broker group. This is designed to 
reduce conflicts of interest and price manipulation. 
</P>

MERGER VICTIMS TURN TO 'SWINE' TO HELP BRING HOME THE BACON 
</P>

Move over, Elks. Look out, Lions. Shriners and Masons, be forewarned: The Swine 
Singers are coming. The Loyal Order of Swine Singers, that is. 
</P>
<P>
This is a group that believes misery loves company. The fledgling fellowship -- 
its initials spell "LOSS" -- is made up of workers whose careers have been 
disrupted by corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Never try to teach a pig to sing," the Swine Singers advise, noting that 
executives rarely listen to those whose company they have taken over. "All you 
do is waste your time and annoy the pig." 
</P>
<P>
Who are these people? 
</P>
<P>
The offbeat notion came from a clique of executives in Winston-Salem, N.C., a 
region hit hard by buyouts of RJR Nabisco, Piedmont Airlines, Burlington 
Industries, Pilot Freight Lines and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, "We were all sitting there crying in our beer and one of us 
said, 'Hey -- we've got a lot in common,' " recalled William D. Gardner, a 
Swine Singer who left his post with Piedmont after it was taken over by USAir. 
</P>
<P>
What they had in common was the stress and anxiety of uncertain futures because 
of corporate restructuring. The executives thought that a society of fellow 
sufferers might provide a lighthearted stress release, boost mutual morale 
through humor and maybe even lead to a jobs grapevine. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, the first 40 Swine Singers were inducted at a black-tie dinner, 
with souvenirs that included rubber pig snouts and T-shirts with a swinish coat 
of arms (the fine print says "totus porkus," or whole hog.) 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 130 people in a handful of cities including Los Angeles; Boston; 
New York; Ft. Worth, Tex.; Orlando, Fla.; Lincoln, Neb., and Ft. Wayne, Ind., 
call themselves Swine Singers. 
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies to establish new "sties" -- Swine parlance for chapters -- have been 
held in several other cities, including Seattle, Dallas and Clearwater, Fla. 
The group has even retained a Winston-Salem public relations firm, McDowell 
&amp; Associates, to handle public inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
While currently a loose-knit combination of support group and social network, 
the Swine Singers have ambitions. They seek to offer professional job 
counseling one day and, perhaps, a relief fund for the human casualties of 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short on Funds 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have a support fund now because they don't have any funds," 
explained spokeswoman June McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
The Swine Singers have their own way of doing things. Members are encouraged, 
for instance, to signal each other "with a finger under the nose and a discreet 
grunt," according to John Hunter, a founding member, whose own marketing career 
has been disrupted by three takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter added another piece of porcine wisdom that he attributed to Winston 
Churchill: "Dogs look up to you. Cats look down on you. Pigs consider you their 
equals."' 
</P>
<P>
There is a serious side to all this. Some members, clinging to jobs in 
taken-over firms, are so jittery about offending their new masters that they 
keep their membership secret. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the principal founder -- known in some quarters as "His Royal 
Swineness" -- remains "in-hog-nito." 
</P>
<P>
"Mergers can take a lot of things away from you -- your authority, your job," 
Gardner declared. "But don't let them take away your sense of humor or your 
self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
It is a struggle faced by many these days. More than 1,300 mergers and 
takeovers were reported last year, involving more than $457 billion in deals, 
according to IDD Information Services in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nagging Fears 
</P>
<P>
One consequence is that many once-secure managers have a nagging fear that 
their jobs can be plucked away if they fail to meet rigorous standards of 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that if you made it to vice president of a big, stable American 
company, you'd really made it," said Stanley R. Weingart, a psychologist and 
senior lecturer at the USC School of Business Administration. "Now it's pretty 
iffy. If you don't produce this quarter, you might be out." 
</P>
<P>
When a takeover actually occurs, he said, the stress can be overwhelming: "On a 
scale of one to 10 -- with 10 being 'I'm faced with imminent death' -- it's got 
to be an eight."

OIL PRICES SOAR PAST $22 AFTER NORTH SEA RIG BLAST

Oil prices surged to their highest levels since early 1986 on Wednesday after 
an explosion on a North Sea platform shut off a quarter of Britain's oil 
production. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 227 workers on the platform was hurt in the explosion, which 
followed a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate, the key U.S. 
crude, for May delivery jumped $1.10 to close at $22.61 a barrel in heavy 
trading, the highest level since Jan. 17, 1986. Earlier in the day, the 
benchmark oil soared to $22.90 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion on a small gas platform Tuesday forced the shutdown of a major 
oil pipeline carrying 472,000 barrels a day of Brent crude mostly to European 
cities. Officials of Shell U. K. Exploration Production did not say when normal 
operations would resume. The platform is a main gathering point for Brent crude 
coming from major oil fields in the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pumping Station Leak 
</P>
<P>
Prices received a further boost when BP America Inc., a subsidiary of British 
Petroleum Ltd., said Wednesday that flow on the Trans-Alaska pipeline would be 
cut by 25% during the day because of a leak at a pumping station. The operator 
of the pipeline said repairs to the pumping station were to have been finished 
late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute released its monthly report showing that 
domestic production in March totaled 7.65 million barrels a day, down 8.2%, or 
690,000 barrels a day, from the year-ago level. U.S. production had not been 
that low since 1964, when it averaged 7.61 million barrels a day, according to 
Ron Planting, API senior analyst in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The API, which represents major oil producers and refiners, attributed the drop 
to the March 24 Alaskan oil spill and to declining production in other major 
U.S. oil fields. The spill last month temporarily shut down critical oil 
shipping lanes into the lower United States. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were also pushed by an API weekly report issued after the close of 
trading Tuesday, saying that crude oil stocks fell 5.7 million barrels for the 
week ended April 14. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, crude oil shot 75 cents higher to $20.90 a barrel, extending a rally 
that had already boosted gasoline prices around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The May gasoline contract climbed 0.76 cents to close at 74.62 cents a gallon 
after touching 76.50 cents a gallon in morning NYMEX trading. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices have been pushed up by the Alaskan oil spill, a tight domestic 
gasoline market, supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and earlier North Sea accidents. 
</P>
<P>
C. Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc., said many in and 
out of the industry are questioning the reason for the North Sea accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this happening because of low oil prices and companies cutting back on 
maintenance to keep up profitability?" he mused. "If so, these types of things 
will continue happening."

Hasbro Seeks to Buy Coleco: Hasbro Inc. announced a plan to buy most of the 
assets of Coleco Industries Inc., the troubled maker of Cabbage Patch dolls 
that is now in bankruptcy proceedings. John O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial 
officer, said the proposed transaction was valued at $90 million to $95 
million. Hasbro, of Pawtucket, R.I., the nation's largest toy maker, said it 
has an agreement with Coleco's unsecured creditors' committee to seek 
bankruptcy court permission to buy Coleco, which filed for Chapter 11 
protection from its creditors in July, 1988.

LEGAL ROADBLOCK IN DREXEL CASE MAY FORCE LONG DELAY 
</P>

<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s landmark settlement of securities fraud charges 
hit a major roadblock Wednesday in the form of a legal technicality. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said a ruling by a federal appeals court could delay final 
settlement of the case for months, dragging out a chapter that the beleaguered 
investment banking group had hoped was now behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The hitch arose when a U.S. Court of Appeals in New York denied a motion by 
Drexel and the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow U.S. District Judge 
Milton Pollack to rule on the settlement. His approval is necessary for the 
agreement to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Drexel, its former "junk bond" chief Michael Milken and his 
brother, Lowell, asked that Pollack be removed from the case, charging that he 
had a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court had denied the motion, but issued an order that prevents 
Pollack from making any rulings in the case until the removal question is taken 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling could seriously delay the civil settlement with the 
SEC. It could also delay Drexel's separate agreement to plead guilty to six 
criminal charges and pay $650 million in fines, which is contingent on the 
civil settlement. 
</P>
<P>
On April 5, the Milkens asked the Supreme Court to hear the Pollack matter. The 
court has not yet responded. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of Drexel's agreement with the SEC require the Wall Street group to 
fire Michael Milken and withhold his 1988 bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said it could not lift the stay because the matter is pending 
before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"The stay . . . will remain in effect until the Supreme Court disposes of the 
case," wrote the three-member panel of the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed settlement agreement between the SEC and Drexel clearly may 
affect the interests of Michael and Lowell Milken," it added. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Goldsmith, a lawyer in the SEC's enforcement division, said one 
interpretation of the ruling is that it does not allow another judge to rule on 
the settlement. He said the SEC was considering its options. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very eager to get this settlement in place and running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers involved in the case said that if the Supreme Court decides to hear the 
matter, it could take months before arguments are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman, said the company has already undertaken 
some of the changes called for in the settlement and will continue to implement 
other requirements it feels are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said she could not predict when the court 
might decide whether it will hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Drexel and the Milkens sought to have Pollack removed from the civil 
case on grounds that Pollack's wife held a stake in a Texas department store 
chain being purchased by a Drexel-financed suitor. 
</P>
<P>
But legal experts said Drexel's charges may have been motivated by Pollack's 
reputation of being sympathetic toward the government and harsh toward 
white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack and defense lawyers exchanged heated words last fall during a hearing 
where lawyers asked Pollack to step down.

NO 'CREDIBLE' EASTERN BUYERS, LORENZO SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HE TELLS HIS SIDE OF WHY SALE TO UEBERROTH FAILED

<P>
Frank Lorenzo went on the offensive Wednesday, declaring that there are no 
"credible" buyers for bankrupt Eastern Airlines and detailing the reasons that 
Peter V. Ueberroth's plan to buy the strikebound carrier fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern and of the airline's parent, Texas Air Corp., 
reiterated that Eastern is no longer for sale and insisted that it can succeed 
as a downsized carrier. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Lorenzo said, assets would be sold and bids have already been made 
for a variety of assets, including Eastern's entire airplane fleet. But he 
wouldn't say which assets would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo denied assertions made earlier this week in bankruptcy court that a 
mysterious fourth bidder for Eastern had materialized. He also said no talks 
are under way concerning the sale of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Pressure 
</P>
<P>
However, Texas Air remains under pressure to sell Eastern. Bankruptcy Judge 
Burton R. Lifland has previously indicated that he thinks that is the best way 
to get Eastern's planes back in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Well-placed union sources said formal bids from TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn and 
a separate, unidentified group can be expected Monday in bankruptcy court at a 
hearing before Lifland on whether the airline should be auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo, who has taken a public beating at the hands of the unions that 
bitterly oppose him and whose striking members have virtually grounded Eastern 
since March 4, talked about Eastern's predicament with a handful of reporters 
at Texas Air headquarters here. He also pressed his case in a guest editorial 
for the Miami Herald in Eastern's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said he had made telephone calls Wednesday to some of Eastern's 
striking pilots and had prepared a video for members of the striking Air Line 
Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo explained at some length his opposition to the naming of a trustee to 
manage Eastern's affairs while it is being reorganized under auspices of 
federal bankruptcy court. The naming of such a trustee was demanded by the 
carrier's unions as part of their partnership with Ueberroth, the former 
baseball commissioner, who wanted to buy Eastern for $464 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks Fell Apart 
</P>
<P>
When the two sides failed to agree that a trustee should be named, the talks 
fell apart. Lorenzo said Ueberroth phoned him as recently as Tuesday and "made 
it very plain that he is out of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo's position was that under a trustee he would lose control of the 
company before any money changed hands. Before such a deal was closed, he said, 
the buyer could even claim that the company was worth less than it was when the 
deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't move out of a house until you get paid for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To strike a compromise, Lorenzo said he even offered to make Ueberroth 
co-chairman of Eastern and give his people three seats on Eastern's board with 
the opportunity to take part in all major decisions while the airline remained 
in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo also revealed that he had been talking to Ueberroth for two years about 
coming to work for Eastern when his baseball job ended. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing more relaxed and less gaunt than at recent public appearances, 
Lorenzo indicated that there had been others interested in buying Eastern in 
addition to the Ueberroth group, Icahn and Chicago hotelier Jay Pritzker. But 
these people don't recognize the value of the assets of the carrier, he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want to get Eastern airlines for nothing," he said. "They want 
to pay beads, jelly beans or whatever. They want to steal the company." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said the sale of Eastern's northeastern shuttle was an example of how 
Eastern would be raising cash to remain liquid. He said that if the pending 
sale to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump had taken place earlier, 
Eastern would not have had to file for bankruptcy.

AMI PLANS TO ENCOURAGE OTHER BUYOUT BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Medical International, under pressure from key shareholders to respond 
to a bid to buy the company, said Wednesday that it will seek other offers. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills hospital management firm decided to encourage others to bid 
before taking a position on a $24-a-share buyout offer from a group led by Dr. 
M. Lee Pearce, an AMI director and major shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce and his two partners in Shamrock Investments Acquisition Corp., a Los 
Angeles group that is unrelated to Roy E. Disney's Shamrock Holdings, joined 
forces March 23 and offered to buy AMI for $1.7 billion, nearly all in cash. On 
the same date, an investment banking firm submitted a competing proposal -- a 
restructuring plan to increase share prices to $25 to $29 per share, including 
a special cash dividend. The trading range for AMI stock during the past year 
had been $14 to $18 per share. 
</P>
<P>
AMI has taken no position on the proposals. Instead, the company immediately 
created a special committee to evaluate the offers and explore other options. 
The panel, composed of seven of AMI's 15 board members, decided that the 
company should solicit other bids and examine other recapitalization plans, 
according to a company statement. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of the process," said the statement, "AMI will enter into discussions 
with third parties who express an interest in acquiring the company. Non-public 
information would be provided to qualified parties who execute an acceptable 
confidentiality agreement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Adviser 
</P>
<P>
AMI said it has retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. as its financial adviser and 
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom as its legal adviser. The statement 
was released after the close of trading at the New York Stock Exchange, where 
AMI shares finished unchanged Wednesday at $21.75. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes five days after RTF Partners, a major AMI investor group 
led by the billionaire Bass brothers of Texas, warned AMI management that it 
may sue or attempt to take over the company if it failed to take quick action 
to boost the value of AMI stock. RTF urged AMI to solicit other offers. 
</P>
<P>
The AMI statement said there was "no assurance" that they would choose any of 
the options. However, some industry analysts said the company would accept one 
of the options. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, they have to do what's right for the shareholders," said Rae 
Alperstein, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. "And 
that means they will restructure or sell." 
</P>
<P>
Alperstein said AMI decided to solicit other offers to get the Pearce group to 
raise its bid and to lure other potential buyers into a bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., 
predicted that there would be no new bidders. He said the company is examining 
the recapitalization option because it may want to fend off Pearce or the RTF 
group by buying its own stock.

Associates, a West Los Angeles advertising agency specializing in the Latino 
market, have ended. Robert C. Horlick, president and chief executive officer of 
the Orange County publishing firm, said the firm will actively pursue other 
merger and acquisition opportunities. Meanwhile, the firm, which has only four 
full-time employees, is "winding down" and is not actively soliciting 
manuscripts or published books, Horlick said.

The directors of Community Psychiatric Centers in Laguna Hills approved a plan 
Wednesday to spin off two of the company's three divisions into a new 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of psychiatric hospitals and other medical businesses said the 
move is intended to speed growth of both the remaining company and the newly 
formed business, which will be named Vivra. 
</P>
<P>
Community Psychiatric will retain ownership of its national psychiatric 
hospital chain, which accounted for 76% of the company's fiscal 1988 revenue of 
$355 million. Vivra will operate a national chain of kidney dialysis centers 
and a home health care services business. 
</P>
<P>
Newly issued shares of Vivra will be distributed at no cost to holders of 
Community Psychiatric stock, who will retain their ownership in the existing 
company. The distribution will be based on a ratio of one Vivra share for every 
five to 10 Community Psychiatric shares, with the exact number to be determined 
later. 
</P>
<P>
James W. Conti, Community Psychiatric's chief executive, said Vivra's stock 
probably will be traded in the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Conti said the spinoff is intended to enhance the growth opportunities of the 
two companies, and also to make Community Psychiatric's stock more attractive 
to investors. 
</P>
<P>
"CPC stock has been hampered in the past year because of the slower growth rate 
and smaller profit margins" of the kidney dialysis and home health care units, 
Conti said. 
</P>
<P>
In Wall Street jargon, Community Psychiatric stock will become "a pure play" in 
which its business is devoted virtually entirely to one line of business -- 
psychiatric clinics. Since many investors prefer to buy stocks of tightly 
focused companies instead of more diversified firms, that could fuel more 
investor interest and higher stock prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newly formed Vivra should benefit, Conti said, because it will be able to seek 
acquisitions of companies in related businesses that Community Psychiatric 
previously shunned as too speculative. 
</P>
<P>
Roger L. Green, Community Psychiatric's chairman, will leave that post to serve 
as chief executive of Vivra. He will continue as a consultant and director of 
Community Psychiatric. 
</P>
<P>
Conte will continue as president and chief executive of Community Psychiatric. 
He also will become a director of Vivra. 
</P>
<P>
Community Psychiatric stock closed Wednesday at a 52-week high of $29.875 per 
share, up $1, in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
The company employs about 5,000 people nationwide, about 300 of whom work in 
Orange County.

CHANDLER'S LIQUIDATION SALE TO START AT NOON TODAY AT 2 FURNITURE STORES 
</P>

<P>
The long-awaited liquidation sale at Chandler's furniture stores in Santa Ana 
and Laguna Hills is scheduled to start at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was announced this week by Norwest Business Credit Inc., Chandler's 
largest creditor. Norwest will conduct the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Minneapolis lender has claimed that it is owed $2.9 million on loans made 
to Chandler's, one of Orange County's oldest businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Because it has a secured lien on the stores' inventory, Norwest has taken 
possession of the furniture and plans to sell it to pay off or reduce the debt. 
</P>
<P>
The liquidation sale had been scheduled to occur on at least two previous 
dates, but in both instances the stores failed to open as promised. 
</P>
<P>
"Delays were unavoidable. We had to get the correct permits and do things 
properly," said Greg Wilson, Norwest's senior loan administrator. Now, Wilson 
said, "everything is ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Chandler's, John Baker of Newport Beach, said the owners of the 
business hope to pick up the pieces and keep the stores open once Norwest is 
finished selling the existing inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that Chandler's has "a handshake deal" to secure financing to allow 
the retailer to continue operations. "We have an agreement in principle," Baker 
said.

UCI'S PITCH: BOTH PARTIES WILL PROSPER IF PRIVATE INDUSTRY WILL BACK PUBLIC 
RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer

<P>
UC Irvine officials encouraged more than 100 Orange County business executives 
Wednesday to join the university in an ambitious effort to explore the 
frontiers of biomedical technology and turn a profit in the process. 
</P>
<P>
At a daylong conference at UCI's Beckman Center, university representatives 
described a range of current research efforts -- from advanced organ 
preservation to exotic particle accelerators -- that could lend themselves to 
commercial collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
"To fund new technologies so they can be of use to the public, we must promote 
ourselves to industry," said Dr. Walter Henry, dean of the UCI College of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Henry and other university officials discussed the possibilities for greater 
exchange of technologies with executives of dozens of Orange County biomedical 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
UCI has been increasing its efforts to attract corporate investment to fund 
research efforts because of a decline in federal funding and because of a need 
for more money to better compete with other research universities. 
</P>
<P>
The university wants companies to take new inventions or processes conceived in 
UCI labs and to spend their own money to develop them. The public-private 
collaborations are considered especially useful to get potential new drugs 
through the lengthy and expensive clinical trials required for U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration marketing approval. 
</P>
<P>
University officials said they also hope to increase the use of UCI researchers 
to conduct clinical testing for private firms and to expand the exchange of 
information between professors and biomedical companies. 
</P>
<P>
At the forum, UCI presented a list of more than 15 new technologies that could 
form the basis of joint ventures between UCI and private firms. Those 
technologies included medical applications for a highly advanced acoustic 
microscope and a three-dimensional memory device. 
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous development of the university and the county's expanding 
biomedical industry has speeded the evolution of technology transfer. It has 
made businesses far more aware of what the university can provide them, and it 
has given rise to what some characterize as the "entrepreneurial professor." 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, UCI officials said, there was little communication between the 
university and the few biotechnology companies in the county at the time, and 
the university's resources were rarely promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is now seeking to expand its cooperation with industry, UCI 
professors have been involved for several years with local biomedical firms as 
consultants and company board members. Executives said the university has 
developed a reputation as a research institution at which that kind of 
interaction is welcomed and encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"UCI is one of only two universities I've ever dealt with where I can pick up 
the phone and bounce ideas off of researchers without a lot of obstacles. It's 
valuable to a business," said Donald W. Ashbrook, vice president of scientific 
affairs for Sigma Tau Pharmaceuticals Inc., an Italian company with U.S. 
offices in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, UCI's corporate involvement took an innovative turn when three 
nationally known UCI brain researchers formed a private pharmaceutical firm to 
develop diagnostic products and drugs to help victims of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The university, which holds the patent rights to the technology being developed 
by the company, Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., stands to benefit because it will 
receive royalty revenue from the firm's future sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although executives characterized the rewards of investing in university 
research projects as potentially lucrative, some said they had been 
apprehensive about becoming involved with a university because educational 
institutions tend to be bureaucratic and place severe restrictions on 
commercial applications of licensed technology. 
</P>
<P>
Several executives attending the conference recalled waiting more than a year 
to obtain licensing for products developed within universities, including the 
University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Vice Chancellor Leon Schwartz said product licensing has recently been 
reorganized to speed approval of technology-sharing arrangements. Some 
executives said they expect that the licensing system will eventually be 
decentralized so that each campus has its own decision-making authority. As it 
is, approval is centralized. 
</P>
<P>
"There are clearly some barriers the university is trying to reduce," Henry 
said. "But we also must protect the university's resources." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rosenbluth, president of Advanced Surgical Intervention in San Clemente, 
described the technologies that UCI is developing as promising for potential 
commercial applications. But Rosenbluth said his company probably won't attempt 
to license any. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he hopes the university can handle more of the clinical 
testing for products developed by Advanced Surgical, which makes devices for 
urological treatment. Previously, Rosenbluth has gone to Boston for the tests.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SINGER JOHN PRINE IS GLAD LITERATE LYRICS ARE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer-songwriters are becoming the rage in pop music once more, just as they 
were in the early 1970s, when the term "singer-songwriter" was coined for the 
likes of James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne. 
</P>
<P>
As a singer-songwriter who went through it all the first time around, John 
Prine is pleased, but not inordinately excited, that a quieter, more intimate 
and literate form of music making is coming back into vogue with such success 
stories as Tracy Chapman and the Cowboy Junkies. 
</P>
<P>
(Prine's moving 1971 song, "Angel From Montgomery," is a bookend of sorts to 
Chapman's breakthrough hit, "Fast Car." Where Chapman's "Fast Car" protagonist 
is a young woman desperately dreaming of a way to break out of an urban 
economic trap, Prine's heroine is rural, aging and on the verge of giving up 
altogether. The woman's refrain, "Just give me one thing that I can hold 
onto/To believe in this living is just a hard way to go," is one that Chapman's 
character would immediately second.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice," Prine said of the success of a new generation of 
singer-songwriters as he spoke over the phone Tuesday from the airport in 
Nashville, where he was about to fly west for a round of shows that will bring 
him to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano for a 3-night stand this weekend. 
"It can't hurt at all. It's better than me having to go heavy metal." 
</P>
<P>
Prine, whose penchant for the wry tag line extends to his songwriting, was not 
about to go metallic before the current folk resurgence hit. Now that it is 
here, he said, he doesn't have any particular stratagems in mind for 
capitalizing on it. 
</P>
<P>
Folk-based music oriented toward the singer-songwriter "just keeps coming back 
after a while," said Prine, who wore the "new-Dylan" mantle for a time after 
his excellent 1971 debut album. "I haven't really changed too much of what I've 
been doing over the years. I'm just on the straight and narrow, keeping on 
working, and if I get to a bigger audience, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Business as usual for Prine means waiting for new songs to dawn on him . . . 
and waiting and waiting some more. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I won't write a song for 14 months," he said. "Then I'd write four 
or five at once. It doesn't bother me as much as it used to. I'm just getting 
used to how I do it." Prine said that a fertile streak back around Christmas 
put him close to a full deck of songs for a new album. "I'm waiting for two 
more, and I'll get in the studio this summer," he said, with an eye toward a 
fall release. If he meets that deadline, it would be only the fourth album of 
new songs for Prine during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
As his own boss, Prine hasn't had to meet somebody else's production schedule. 
He formed Oh Boy Records in 1981, and has released and marketed his last three 
albums on the label. The most recent one, "John Prine Live," was the first live 
album of his career. Prine recorded all but four of its 19 songs at the Coach 
House in March, 1988, during his last shows there. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be lip-syncing the record," in the upcoming return concerts, he 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
After all these years as a do-it-yourselfer, Prine is getting some attention 
from high places in the music industry. Through his friend, record producer 
Jack Clement, Prine struck up an acquaintance with U2, the superstar Irish rock 
band. He said that has led to Oh Boy being distributed in Europe by U2's label, 
Mother Records. 
</P>
<P>
Prine said he also has been discussing a U.S.-distribution deal with major 
American labels. 
</P>
<P>
"That way we can be in all the stores instead of people having to get 
directions down the block to find out where the record is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
GOING TO EXTREMES: Having been refused permission to sell alcoholic beverages, 
Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach will experiment with letting people bring 
their own drinks to a dance-concert April 27 that the club is billing as a 
private party for patrons 21 and over. Owner William (Max) Nee said that the 
"private party" designation means it will be up to the club's doorman to extend 
or withhold invitation to those who want to get in -- as is commonly done at 
private dance clubs in New York City. It is the latest attempt by Postnuclear 
to attract a 21-and-older (i.e., drinking) audience, which Nee has said is 
important to the club's success. 
</P>
<P>
Postnuclear is calling its Thursday night over-21 club Extreme 775, after its 
address, 775 Laguna Canyon Road. The plan is to showcase new, innovative 
dance-rock talent. The inaugural night next Thursday will feature A-Politiq, 
from Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council has denied Club Postnuclear permission to sell 
beer, despite Nee's promises to take a variety of measures to promote 
responsible drinking and prevent drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
CO-OP ROCK: Exude, the veteran Anaheim rock band that has had success over the 
years in releasing its records independently, is trying to help other emerging 
rockers get a nationwide hearing through a project called Co-Op. The idea, said 
Exude's singer, Frank Rogala, is to recruit 10 acts to share the cost of 
manufacturing and mailing a cooperative compact disc that would contain one 
song from each performer. The estimated cost is $480 to $550 for each artist in 
the co-op, Rogala said. Plans call for sending a professional-looking CD 
package with biographical information on each artist to 500 college radio 
stations and an additional 150 to 200 CDs to record companies and the music 
press. Interested musicians can call Exude's business operation, Integrated 
Entertainment Management, at (714) 995-0471. Rogala said the project needs 
artists to commit by May 1, to ensure that the CD can be manufactured and 
mailed in September to increase chances of college radio airplay. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Rogala said, Exude may not be able to include one of its own songs 
on the CD because the band's latest material may not be ready in time for 
Co-Op's June 1 recording submission deadline. Even so, Rogala said, by 
spearheading such a project, Exude should be able to continue the buzz it built 
for itself by winning the last of MTV's monthly Basement Tapes video contests 
for unsigned bands, and by being named last year as one of the Top 10 unsigned 
bands in a contest run by Musician magazine. 
</P>
<P>
JUST WAIT TILL HE'S 5: The littlest rocker of them all is Anthony Minutoli, age 
2 1/2, of Tustin. During Rod Stewart's show last Friday at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre, Anthony's dad, Michael Minutoli, brought him down to the front of 
the stage and held him up, hoping that Stewart would shake his son's hand. 
Instead, Rod the Mod took Minutoli by surprise, lifting Anthony out of his 
father's arms and cradling the tot on stage while he sang "Forever Young," 
Stewart's hit father-to-son benediction. With some coaxing -- and after the 
elder Minutoli had jumped on stage to undo the hood his son was wearing -- 
Stewart got Anthony to sing the title refrain softly into his microphone. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Anthony got down from the stage, his father said, "About 50 girls 
came up and gave this kid a kiss."

CUBISM SURVIVES INTACT AT ARTS CENTER IN MASSINE'S 'PARADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonide Massine's "Parade" has become known as the ballet that brought Cubism 
into the theater. 
</P>
<P>
A stellar collaboration between Satie (music), Cocteau (scenario), Massine 
(choreography) and Picasso (sets and costumes), created in 1917 for the 
Diaghilev Ballets Russes, "Parade" fell out of the repertory for nearly 50 
years and was revived for the Joffrey Ballet in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Massine supervised this revival. Reportedly, Picasso himself had to approve the 
new sets and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Massine taught his role of the Chinese Conjurer to Joffrey's Gary Chryst, who 
in turn set it upon several next-generation Joffrey dancers, including Philip 
Jerry (seen locally last year), Peter Narbutas and Edward Stierle, who will 
dance the role this week in Orange County. (A review of the opening performance 
of the Joffrey Ballet's Orange County engagement is on Page 1 of this section.) 
</P>
<P>
Chryst helped the two focus on the elements of Cubism in the role. 
</P>
<P>
"He emphasized the feeling of weight and solidity and squareness," Narbutas 
said in a recent phone interview. (Narbutas will dance the Chinese Conjurer 
tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.) 
</P>
<P>
"The shoulders are kept very flat to the audience," he said. "All the angles, 
relative to the shoulders and to the body, are very square and angular. There 
is a certain tension that is created, similar to (that in Nijinsky's) 
'Afternoon of a Faun,' which has similar stylistic points." 
</P>
<P>
Narbutas finds other contrasts built into the role. 
</P>
<P>
"Another fairly prominent counterpoint is between a certain softness -- some 
movements are almost geisha-girl like -- and this very hard, very grotesque 
side to the character," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are moments where the face is completely distorted. . . . The tongue is 
extended fully down and out of the mouth, and the eyes rolled back into the 
back of the head, so you see nothing but the white of the eyes." 
</P>
<P>
For Narbutas, however, the central contrast is that between "moments of 
complete stillness and Zen-like serenity" and "incredible, dynamic 
explosiveness." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of being completely withdrawn, or internalized, and then 
absolutely spewing out and just exploding both in movements, like huge leaps, 
the biggest leaps you could possibly manage, coming out of nowhere, or in this 
big, screaming face." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve what Narbutas calls "almost a humming stillness" from which the 
explosions must occur, he meditates between 20 minutes and an hour each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing how still still can be helps in a piece like this, especially," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"To really get any tension, anything that draws the audience in, mesmerizes 
them, the stillness has to be something, not just a lack of movement. It has to 
be utterly, absolutely, completely stone still. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You could be a rock -- that inanimate -- then all of a sudden become a gushing 
waterfall. That's what makes the piece so unusual and fascinating for the 
audience, if that is achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Stierle, who will dance the role at the Saturday matinee, also focuses upon the 
Cubist quality of the choreography. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sharp, clipped quality to the movements, coming from nowhere and 
going to somewhere," he said. "You can go into something with no preparation." 
</P>
<P>
He said the role presents "an incredible challenge to an artist, a dancer, to 
achieve the intricate details it requires. 
</P>
<P>
"The role is the ultimate of coordination," he said. "Not only are you creating 
this aura of mystery, but also it entails a great deal of coordination between 
your hands, arms, your eyeballs, your expression. It entails so many different 
things." 
</P>
<P>
For Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey, the Cubist elements in 
"Parade" become metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Parade' is one of the most sophisticated ballets," he said. "It is almost 
like a T. S. Eliot cocktail party in its approach." 
</P>
<P>
"Metaphorically, Massine was . . . showing man in his appetites -- his avarice, 
his greed, his attitudes. They are all portrayed. Everything in the ballet, to 
me, is a comment on the horseplay of the humans." 
</P>
<P>
 Massine's "Parade" will be part of two Diaghilev programs presented during the 
Joffrey Ballet's current run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. Peter Narbutas is scheduled to dance the role of the Chinese 
Conjurer tonight at 8. Edward Stierle will dance the role at 2 p.m. on 
Saturday. Tickets: $13 to $39. Information: (714) 556-2787.

THEATER COMPANY TELLS IT TO THE MARINES 
</P>

<P>
The Way Off Broadway Playhouse can't be accused of pulling any punches. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Santa Ana-based company traveled to the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station to present four short vignettes, collectively titled "Temporary 
Sanity," which portray domestic violence among military families in brutal and 
profanity-laced terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Temporary Sanity" will be presented for civilian audiences on Friday and 
Saturday at the company's theater in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday at El Toro, the 45-minute production was part of a larger program 
focusing on child and spousal abuse, sponsored by the base's Family Service 
Center. The high-stress military life style, which can include long hours on 
duty, frequent and lengthy family separations and low pay, was cited by several 
speakers as causing a high incidence of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Temporary Sanity" portrayed four examples of violent situations: a husband who 
verbally and physically abuses his wife and young daughter; the aftermath of a 
wife-beating in which the husband is implored to seek counseling; an instance 
where the wife of a Marine takes her frustration out on her young son, and a 
staff sergeant who verbally and physically abuses his teen-age stepson. 
</P>
<P>
The vignettes employ harsh language and violent actions, and all portray some 
degree of alcohol abuse. Allison Gappa, who wrote the production, said there 
was some pressure from the military to tone down the language and the violence, 
and to play down references to alcoholism, after officials saw the play in 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
She said they were also unhappy with the first vignette, which ends in blackout 
with the Marine husband pinning his wife to the floor and beating her. The 
other skits offer some measure of resolution: A wife stands up to her husband 
and convinces him to seek counseling; a Marine couple reports the abuse of a 
neighbor's child; a stepfather and son come to a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't said, 'Don't do this,' " Gappa said Wednesday after the first of 
two performances. But "they squirmed a little." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Bach, director of the production, and producer Tony Reverditto were in 
on discussions with the military. "If we go and soften it for the military, we 
can't get the message across," Bach argued. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the vignettes were performed as originally written, and Way Off 
Broadway members said the Marines were largely cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
Gappa, for instance, received help in learning military jargon from the staff 
of the Family Services Center, and another group of Marines helped the actors 
portraying military men to prepare for their roles, and even took them to the 
base barber to get military haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
Way Off Broadway became involved in the event after officials of Parent Help 
USA, a nonprofit group that organized Wednesday's event, read a feature story 
about the theater company in The Times. The theater company was asked to 
participate just 4 weeks ago; Gappa was asked to write the production on a 
Sunday, and had to have a script ready for the actors on the following 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Reverditto, founder and president of the Way Off Broadway Playhouse and Acting 
Studio, became the producer of Wednesday's entire 2 1/2-hour program. "They've 
helped us in every way they can. They've been wonderful," said Sally Nava 
Kanarek, executive director and co-founder of Parent Help USA. "They've gone 
beyond their play." 
</P>
<P>
Gappa brought a special perspective to her involvement in the production -- she 
was herself abused as a spouse, and has written about domestic violence for 
Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and other publications. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a battered wife 17 years ago," she said. Legally, little could be done 
then about an abusive spouse: "I had the police tell me I should kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Portraying situations of domestic violence in the vignette format, with only 
about 10 minutes per section, provided a special challenge for Gappa and Bach. 
"A full-length production has a kind of arc," Bach said. "We had to get right 
to the point." 
</P>
<P>
Bach said he plans to change the main characters in three of the vignettes to 
civilians for this weekend's performances, mainly to stress the point that 
domestic violence is not restricted to any segment of society. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Mushallo, deputy director of the base's Family Service Center, said she 
doesn't believe that domestic violence is any more prevalent among military 
families than among other social groups. "The essential difference is that we 
can count them" because the military community is relatively self-contained, 
she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
She worried that the harshness of the scenes in "Temporary Sanity" might put 
off some members of Wednesday's all-military audience but agreed that "for the 
drama of it, all the bad things have to be exposed." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Wesley Sanders, who watched the Wednesday morning program, said he has not 
encountered the issue of domestic violence directly through neighbors or 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like anything. It can get hectic," Sanders said of the military life 
style. But he added that he can see how incidents of abuse arise for 
individuals who must take orders all day. "You come home," Sanders said, "and 
you have that liberty of giving orders yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Temporary Sanity" will be performed Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the 
42-seat Way Off Broadway Playhouse, 1058 E. 1st St., Santa Ana. There will be 
musical performances in addition to the dramatic production. Tickets are $25, 
with a percentage of the proceeds going to benefit Parent Help USA.

HALL, MASTER CHORALE MERGER APPLAUDED BY ARTS COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the county's musical community reacted positively to Tuesday's 
announcement that the William Hall Chorale of Pasadena would be merged into the 
Master Chorale of Orange County, forming a 150-member "superchorale" under 
Hall's direction. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they held out hope that the newly strengthened organization 
might still merge with Orange County's other choral organization, the Pacific 
Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly a forward step," said Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, who was present for the announcement. "It 
clearly strengthens both the financial and the artistic base of the Master 
Chorale." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Spisto, executive director of the Pacific Symphony, who also attended the 
meeting at which the merger was announced, agreed that it "is a very good 
thing. I'm pleased to see Master Chorale is strengthening its forces. I look 
forward to much success for the chorale." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said: "My personal hope continues to be that both the 
Pacific Chorale and the Master Chorale could eventually merge, providing one 
extraordinary group of singers which would truly be Orange County's ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
The symphony has performed with the Pacific Chorale for the past 10 seasons and 
is committed to performing with it through next season, Spisto said. Any future 
decisions regarding joint performances, he added, would have to involve the 
symphony's incoming new music director. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after 10 months of negotiations, talks between the Master and 
Pacific chorales collapsed when members of the Pacific insisted that their 
longtime musical director, John Alexander, head the merged organization. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said yesterday that "the great sadness of the announcement is the 
demise of the William Hall Chorale," which has "provided a major chorale force 
in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander added that his organization is "on a very firm footing" and "stronger 
than we've ever been. Any arts organization is sustained by the enthusiasm of 
its supporters. The Pacific Chorale has that. We can live side by side as long 
as the organizations respect each other." 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll retain our subscription base and augment it," said Anne Nutt, 
who chairs the Pacific Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific's development director, Bonnie McClain, predicted that the merger is 
"not going to affect our funding," since "our subscription base it pretty well 
set." She noted that the Pacific Chorale's repertoire is strictly classical, 
where the Master Chorale appeals to those who "want to go to pops and Broadway 
concerts." 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether the county can support two choral organizations remains 
open, as far as the Pacific Chorale is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think it would be better if there was one chorale," McClain said. 
"Things would be more cohesive. We'll see."

PASADENA WINNERS PLAY A WAITING GAME

George A. Padilla won an easy runoff victory over Juan Francisco Lara Tuesday 
for a seat on the Pasadena Unified Board of Education, but it may be another 
month before he can celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The election is being contested by Arlene Moncrief, who came in third in last 
month's primary and has filed a suit seeking to nullify Padilla's 
4,862-to-2,178-vote victory. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief's suit, filed last month against City Clerk Pamela Swift, claims the 
city violated the intent of the state Election Code by allowing a runoff 
between Padilla and Lara, who withdrew from the campaign two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the case is scheduled for May 19 in Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In the election for another seat on the five-member school board, Wilbert L. 
Smith defeated incumbent James H. McBath by a vote of 4,215 to 3,407. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 38, a vice president with Bank of America in Los Angeles, said his 
victory was a sign that voters wanted new and more aggressive leadership. 
</P>
<P>
McBath, 63, a professor of communications at USC, said he was disappointed not 
only at his loss, but also at the extremely low turnout. Of 104,373 registered 
voters in the district, 7,769 cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"Devastating," he said. "It's just a shame so few voted." 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief's suit stems from the unusual turn of events that followed Lara's 
withdrawal from the race because of unspecified personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lara stopped campaigning, he came in second behind Padilla in the 
March primary. 
</P>
<P>
Because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote, a runoff was scheduled 
between the top two vote-getters: Padilla and Lara. 
</P>
<P>
Lara, 45, a former assistant dean of the UCLA Graduate School of Education, 
wanted the city to take his name off the ballot, but that required a court 
order, which he never sought. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief claims her name should have been on the runoff ballot instead of 
Lara's so the voters would have a choice between two active candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ridiculous having a runoff with only one candidate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Sympathy 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, 43, a civil engineer who runs his own consulting firm in Pasadena, 
said he sympathized with Moncrief's argument, but said the result of Tuesday's 
election is valid. 
</P>
<P>
After the final vote was announced Tuesday night, Padilla said he was relieved 
the long and confusing campaign had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been strange," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Moncrief, 57, an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service, said she plans 
to continue her suit and will ask the court to throw out the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of locked in," she said. "The judge may say, 'Arlene, you're all 
wet.' But I'm going to stay with this to the end."

BEAUCHAMP DROPS PLANS FOR HARBOR VILLAGE LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County "credit dentist" Dr. Robert F. Beauchamp has halted plans to 
lease most of Ventura Harbor's financially troubled retail area, saying the 
price is too high. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, the village's largest creditor, says the 100-business Ventura 
Harbor Village owes $10 million, which must be paid before another operator can 
take over. Beauchamp Enterprises and the Ventura Port District have estimated 
the debt of the village, whose previous operators declared bankruptcy in 1987, 
at $6.5 million to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very discouraging and disappointing," said Ventura Harbor Manager Richard 
Parsons. "While we are getting calls from other interested parties, no one 
wants to pay $10 million." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter last week to the port district, Beauchamp Enterprises, which 
already operates two commercial marinas with 560 slips at Ventura Harbor and 
has assets estimated at $500 million, said it would reconsider if Bank of 
America lowered its demands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Westrec Interested 
</P>
<P>
Westrec, a subsidiary of Glendale-based Public Storage Inc., has also expressed 
interest in operating Harbor Village. A spokesman said that while $10 million 
is too much, the firm is studying how much it can afford. Public Storage has 
assets of $3 billion and owns 19 marinas in the United States, including 
facilities in Sacramento and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Ventura Harbor remains mired in a complex legal quagmire that must be 
unraveled to the satisfaction of almost a dozen parties before a new operator 
can take over. Until it is, long-term planning and promotions for the harbor 
retail area, as well as some wharf maintenance, may have to be postponed, 
Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most complicated action I have ever dealt with," said Peet Saaret, 
a Bank of America vice president for corporate trust administration. "We want 
to bring about a solution to this. If people have an interest in the property, 
they should bring it to the table." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has sued the port district in Ventura Superior Court for 
breach of contract. It has also started foreclosure proceedings to take over 
Ventura Harbor Village, a cluster of shops, restaurants and boating-related 
facilities that comprise the tourist core of Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America is the trustee for about $5.5 million in outstanding 
municipal-type bonds that were issued by Ventura Harbor on behalf of Ocean 
Services Inc. to finance construction of the village. The bonds held the port 
district conditionally liable should Ocean Services default. Because Ocean 
Services did just that with its bankruptcy in 1987, the bank claims in its 
lawsuit that it gained legal right to take possession of the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lease Payments 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that uncollected lease payments plus interest at 12% annual 
rates have raised the debt to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials plan to challenge those figures in court, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the port district would prefer to turn over operations of the 
harbor to Beauchamp Enterprises or Westrec to keep harbor businesses out of the 
control of CIB Development, another firm that has laid claim to the property. 
</P>
<P>
After Ocean Services filed for bankruptcy, Huntington Beach-based CIB bought 
most of the outstanding bonds and has several times attempted to claim legal 
title to Ventura Harbor Village. 
</P>
<P>
So far, harbor officials have thwarted the move in court. 
</P>
<P>
CIB has links to former savings and loan executive Ranbir S. Sahni, who 
operated American Diversified Savings Bank, a Costa Mesa thrift that was seized 
and liquidated by regulators in 1988. That move resulted in a $1.14-billion 
refund to depositors -- the largest payout ever by the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Ties 
</P>
<P>
Bobby S. Mehta, CIB's president, is Sahni's brother-in-law and a longtime Sahni 
aide who once headed a division of American Diversified and served as one of 
its directors. 
</P>
<P>
Federal savings and loan regulators think that CIB is controlled by Sahni, 
according to Joseph E. Thomas, a Costa Mesa attorney representing the FSLIC in 
a lawsuit against Sahni and CIB. 
</P>
<P>
Sahni and Mehta have both denied this. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview Tuesday, Mehta said the ownership of CIB was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"CIB was an innocent victim who bought the bonds in efforts to get a good 
return on their money and is trying to recover its investment and a reasonable 
rate of interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the legal and financial mess, CIB, Beauchamp, Westrec and a number of 
other firms see Ventura Harbor as a potential cash cow once its debt is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Marinas are a unique investment opportunity in that it's difficult to make any 
more of them and boat sales and boating activity is growing at a rate . . . 
that's difficult to keep up with," said Wayne Hughes Jr., a vice president of 
site acquisitions for Public Storage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expertise and Growth 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said a deal with Beauchamp or Westrec would bring expertise and growth 
to Harbor Village. During the tenure of Ocean Services, many tenants found 
business less than booming because of too few tourists, spotty advertising and 
a management style that Parsons said "left a lot to be desired." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Harbor earns some of its $2-million annual budget by leasing Harbor 
Village. The operator, in turn, subleases the shops and boat slips, runs the 
village and turns over to the port district a percentage of gross revenues that 
ranges from 1% to 20%, depending on the business. 
</P>
<P>
Should CIB gain control of the harbor, the port district might be forced to 
turn over all its revenues from leasing Harbor Village -- an estimated $325,000 
annually -- until it pays off the harbor bond debt, Parsons said. Another 
operator would have to agree to pay off that debt to obtain a lease.

POLICE RAID 'SEX CHURCH' IN WEST L.A., ARREST COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They say they are practicing the world's oldest religion. But police say their 
enterprise resembles the world's oldest profession. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the debate surrounding Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, a Canyon Country 
couple who have hit the national talk-show circuit to promote the unorthodox 
theology of the Church of the Most High Goddess, a "sex church" the Tracys 
operate in West Los Angeles. They appeared Feb. 16 on the "Sally Jessy Raphael 
Show" and taped a "Geraldo" show this month that has yet to air. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy says she and other women act as priestesses who absolve the 
sins of male followers through sexual religious rites that predate 
Christianity. So far, she says, she has brought more than 2,000 male converts 
into the church. All women serve as priestesses, and all men serve as 
worshipers, the Tracys said. They said there are 10 priestesses in the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything God wants from me, I will give him," said Tracy, 46. "If he wants me 
to be monogamous, I'll be monogamous. If he says go have sex with 20,000 men, 
I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ex-Building Inspector 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Los Angeles Police Department vice officers arrested the Tracys -- 
Mary Ellen on suspicion of prostitution and Will on suspicion of pimping -- 
citing the couple's request for donations to the church. "If you accept money 
for a sex act, it's prostitution," Detective Alan Vanderpool said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy, 51, a former Santa Monica building inspector who was involved in a 
bizarre and highly publicized dispute with that city's Rent Control Board five 
years ago, acknowledged that church followers must contribute money or services 
to participate in rituals that involve sexual intercourse. But he said the 
contributions are religious sacrifices protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy said he will ask that the case against him and his wife be thrown out on 
religious grounds. Their arraignment is scheduled May 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys live in Canyon Country but operate their church out of a 
four-bedroom, Spanish-style house they rent just outside Beverly Hills in West 
Los Angeles. The sparsely furnished house has no pews or pulpit. The few wall 
hangings include posters of movie stars and a framed nude photograph of Mary 
Ellen Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
During services, priestesses teach the male followers about church doctrine, 
she said. The men confess their sins and have their transgressions forgiven 
during sexual intercourse, she said. Will Tracy said he is the religion's high 
priest, which he called an administrative post. 
</P>
<P>
The church incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Nevada on Dec. 14, 1988, 
but has not applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status. Will 
Tracy declined to discuss its finances. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderpool, a 13-year vice squad veteran, called the church a creative scam, 
similar to fraudulent escort services and massage parlors, to circumvent 
prostitution laws. But even Vanderpool agreed, along with constitutional 
scholars, that the Tracys' church poses an intriguing legal question: Does the 
First Amendment protect an avowed religious practice that appears to be 
prostitution? 
</P>
<P>
In rare instances, state and federal courts have ruled that some illegal acts 
can have religious purposes, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor and 
constitutional expert. California and Arizona courts have said some American 
Indians may use the hallucinogen peyote, normally an illegal narcotic, to 
practice their ancient religions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Amish residents of Wisconsin to remove 
their children from school after the eighth grade, in defiance of compulsory 
education laws, to shield the youngsters from secular teachings in high school, 
said Thomas Grey, a Stanford University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
But claims of religious intent do not guarantee protection from the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bigamy Illegal 
</P>
<P>
Bigamy, although once sanctioned by Mormons, is illegal. Courts repeatedly have 
struck down religious objections to vaccinations because there is a compelling 
public interest to control disease, Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
But how would courts rule on the Church of the Most High Goddess, where Mary 
Ellen Tracy and the other priestesses wear strapless red-sequined dresses, 
fishnet hose and black spiked heels? 
</P>
<P>
Neither professor was familiar with the Tracys' endeavor. But, speaking before 
the couple's arrest last week, the experts said Mary Ellen Tracy's provocative 
dress would definitely hurt the church's chances in court, because fishnet 
stockings and sequins do not denote piety. 
</P>
<P>
Judges find pious intent important when ruling on religious practices that may 
violate the law, the professors said. Although courts will not declare a 
religion valid or invalid, they will decide whether a group sincerely believes 
the doctrine it professes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1962, a federal court in Washington rejected claims by the 
Boo-hoos, a hastily created religious sect, that smoking marijuana was a 
sacrament, Chemerinsky said. The claim was not sincere, the court decided, 
noting that the Boo-hoos' emblem was a three-headed toad. 
</P>
<P>
Another skeptic is Burt DuBrow, producer of the "Sally Jessy Raphael Show." 
DuBrow said he now regrets letting the Tracys appear on the nationally 
syndicated talk show. "I question the validity of the church," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Column 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys insist they are devout, despite Mary Ellen Tracy's weekly column in 
a sexually explicit newspaper, the Hollywood Press, and an erotic video, "When 
Love Came to Town," that she made in November for $500. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy said he received a revelation five years ago to found a church that 
would re-establish the Cult of Isis, a goddess revered in ancient Egypt. The 
church was formally established in May, 1987, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Crossley, a professor of religion at USC, said he knew nothing about 
the Tracys' church but confirmed that some ancient religions, such as the Cult 
of Isis, did include sex acts in their rituals. The religion is thought to have 
died out by 476 with the fall of the Roman Empire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys would not discuss their personal lives in detail. They would not 
talk about their seven children -- ages 4 to 18 -- except to say they are not 
involved in the church. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy holds a master's degree in environmental science and chemistry 
from Portland State University and wrote her thesis on an enzyme found in 
pears. "She's very bright -- no two ways about that," said her former faculty 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy once ran a chain of karate studios in Oregon. He has also worked as 
a folk singer, a movie producer and a financial adviser. But it was in 1984, 
while working as a Santa Monica building inspector, that Tracy made headlines 
through his efforts to defy the city's powerful Rent Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy, who co-owned a beachfront apartment complex in the 1200 block of Ocean 
Front Walk, said the board had no right to prohibit him from demolishing the 
units, even though it was Tracy's job as a building inspector to enforce the 
board's regulations. Two Los Angeles Superior Court judges sided with the 
board, but not before Tracy had evicted two of his seven tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Tracy made headlines again when he tried to purchase a 
Wilshire Boulevard nude dance club called The Ball. The city's personnel board 
refused to approve the purchase, and Tracy eventually left his job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responding to Ad 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested the couple last Tuesday night after Vanderpool 
posed as a man responding to a sexually suggestive ad the Tracys placed in the 
L.A. Express. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderpool said Mary Ellen Tracy requested a $150 donation for the church and 
told him to perform oral sex on her to show his allegiance to the church. When 
he refused, Vanderpool said, she ordered him to leave. Other officers arrested 
the couple as Vanderpool was shown out the front door, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy faces one misdemeanor count of prostitution. Will Tracy is 
accused of one count of pimping, a felony. Both are free on $2,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman found at the house, identified only as Jane Doe, was arrested on 
suspicion of living in a house of ill fame, a misdemeanor, Vanderpool said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy confirmed most of Vanderpool's account but said his wife merely 
asked if the detective was willing to support the church in some way. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys have had other run-ins with the law, but Tracy said they were based 
on misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
Before the church was formally organized, Mary Ellen Tracy was charged with 
prostitution and her husband with running a house of ill fame in Santa Monica 
in February, 1986. The charges were dismissed 11 months later after detectives 
refused to identify an informant who allegedly paid Mary Ellen Tracy $100 to 
have sex, according to court records. Will Tracy said the informant never 
existed, and he denied the prostitution allegation.

VICTORY VOW;

<P>
BEVERLY HILLS MAYOR SAYS HE'LL FINISH CIVIC CENTER, 'EVEN IF I HAVE TO DO IT 
MYSELF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Taking office as the 34th mayor of Beverly Hills, Maxwell Hillary Salter vowed 
to see the city's grandiose new City Hall finished within 12 months -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
Salter, a genial, bearded garment-district magnate, spoke at a Tuesday night 
ceremony that paled in comparison with the dramatics of Monday night's Beverly 
Hills Follies, a musical revue making fun of city officials for the benefit of 
Beverly Hills schools. 
</P>
<P>
He won applause and laughter for his vow: "I solemnly swear, take an oath, 
commit, pledge that the Civic Center will be finished before I leave office 
even if I have to pour cement, paint and plaster it myself." 
</P>
<P>
The City Hall was originally scheduled for completion a year ago this month. 
The latest predictions are for it to be ready sometime in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Commitments 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, delivered under a white tent set up for the occasion in the 
driveway of a new fire station, Salter also committed the city to maintain 
balanced budgets, help fund the school district, make more parking spaces 
available downtown, take steps to fight traffic gridlock and draw up an 
emergency preparedness plan. 
</P>
<P>
As is his habit, Salter quoted from the Talmud, an ancient work of rabbinical 
commentary, to bolster his case for emergency preparedness, saying: "He who 
saves one life, it is as though he has saved the world." 
</P>
<P>
But none of it was as entertaining as the Follies on Monday night, when all 
five City Council members did a chorus-line version of "Puttin' on the Ritz," 
rewritten for Beverly Hills as "Puttin' on the Glitz." 
</P>
<P>
Their version, which included the invaluable tip for politicos, "Kiss 
everybody," was closer to Peter Boyle's clumsy efforts as the monster in "Young 
Frankenstein" than to Fred Astaire's original. 
</P>
<P>
But the sell-out crowd of 300, which paid $125 a head for the evening of inside 
humor, loved it, and they roared at raunchy references to a controversial 
statue that was installed in a park along Santa Monica Boulevard last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other acts featured chiefs, policemen and firemen from the city's public safety 
departments and City Manager Ed Kreins, costumed as Henry VIII, revealing a 
forceful baritone in a song declaring, "I rule the city with a velvet glove." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fiddler' Parody 
</P>
<P>
There was also a parody of Salter as Tevye the Milkman from "Fiddler on the 
Roof," a fictional character who also liked to cite Holy Writ. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important men in town will come to pressure you," a Salter look-alike 
sang, holding his head and paraphrasing the lyrics of the song "If I Were a 
Rich Man." 
</P>
<P>
"They will ask you for a favor: Will you change their zoning, so they'll stop 
this phoning . . . and they build a house that's 50 stories high!" 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Mayor Robert K. Tanenbaum poked fun at his own political ambitions, 
and his vision of Beverly Hills as Camelot, in an off-key takeoff that was even 
less musical than Richard Burton's original. 
</P>
<P>
"In Beverly, the hills of Beverly. . .," he croaked. "If I'm going to be 
district attorney, to qualify to run politically, I know I'll have to take a 
little journey . . . from Beverly." 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Salter's wife, Janet, and written by contributors including Joel 
Pressman, who chairs the performing arts department at Beverly Hills High 
School, Rabbi Jacob Pressman, Joel's father, and writers Stanley Ralph Ross and 
Loni Marston, the show was billed as a first annual event. 
</P>
<P>
But Janet Salter said a new edition may have to wait for a new cast of targets 
to be lampooned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should actually do it every other year, because we'll have a new 
council that way," she said Wednesday. "The phone has been ringing all day, and 
people said the show really helped bring people together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surplus Expected 
</P>
<P>
She said that once expenses are paid, organizers hope to have a $10,000 surplus 
to be divided among the Madrigals, an amateur singing group, the Beverly Hills 
Education Foundation and the city's YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
At the City Council ceremony Tuesday night, Allan Alexander was named vice 
mayor. In Beverly Hills, the office of mayor rotates annually among the five 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor wields more influence than his colleagues because of his roles in 
setting the agenda and summing up the conclusions of the governing body once 
decisions are taken. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also gets more publicity because he acts as spokesman for the city of 
32,000. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, including the mayor, receive stipends of $330 a month.

NEIGHBORS RESIST PAROLE OFFICES IN THEIR BACK YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The search for a site in the west San Gabriel Valley for a state parole office 
reminds some people of the barge filled with trash that was at sea for weeks 
because no city would let it dock. 
</P>
<P>
State parole offices are so unpopular in the west San Gabriel Valley that the 
cities of Alhambra and Monterey Park are going to pay up to $100,000 each to 
get rid of one. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a replacement site in Pasadena was so unsettling to some 
residents that 4,324 signed petitions to keep an office out of their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt, said one state parole official, that it has become very 
difficult to find a suitable location in the area that will not generate 
opposition since the state agreed to close an office on the Alhambra-Monterey 
Park border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sort of on the run," said Robert B. Pomerenke, deputy regional parole 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Sites 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Edward Veit, the Department of Corrections deputy director in 
charge of parole and community services, said he is hopeful that the state will 
find a suitable office in the Pasadena area soon. "The city is working with 
us," Veit said. "We're looking at several sites." 
</P>
<P>
The state has promised to close its parole office at 1721 E. Garvey Ave. by 
October, and Monterey Park and Alhambra have agreed to help pay the costs of 
relocating to the Pasadena area. Parole officials said Monterey Park and 
Alhambra will pay about $100,000 each for relocation benefits and to pay off 
the lease. That amount could be reduced if the vacated building is rented to a 
new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
But before the site is closed, the Department of Corrections must find a new 
location. The Pasadena site that was first selected by the department is in the 
Hastings Ranch area of Pasadena, but homeowners have organized a campaign to 
block that proposal, contending that an influx of felons would endanger their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerenke said the suggestion that parolees are likely to commit crimes while 
they are on their way to or from parole offices is unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "Parolees will tell you, 'We're crooks, but we're not stupid. We're 
not going to screw up around the parole office where parole agents are going in 
and out constantly. That's a ticket back to prison.' 
</P>
<P>
"A person is probably safer having a parole office next door in terms of safety 
from parolees than living far away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jerome DiMaggio, regional administrator who oversees parole offices 
throughout Los Angeles County, conceded that convincing people that parole 
offices are good neighbors is difficult. "We're convinced that parole offices 
are pretty quiet places," DiMaggio said, "but it's hard to convince other 
people of that." 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said the state has operated a parole office on Main Street in 
Alhambra, not far from Alhambra High School, for 10 years without complaint, 
and opened the Garvey Avenue office last year to handle the growing parolee 
population. Together, the offices supervise 2,000 parolees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman Beaten, Robbed 
</P>
<P>
Pomerenke said parole officials became aware of neighborhood concern about the 
Garvey Avenue office last summer after a woman was beaten and robbed in her 
back yard and relatives blamed the attack on the presence of the parole office. 
Pomerenke said parole agents checked the description of the attackers against 
parolees, but found no match. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, a community campaign to close the office got under way 
and before long the parole office was being depicted as the law enforcement 
equivalent of a toxic waste pit. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio, who lives in Alhambra, said the community opposition was 
overwhelming. Even priests, who might be expected to show some compassion, 
DiMaggio said, came forward at community meetings to denounce the parole office 
for bringing unkempt people to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said the low point was reached when the PTA at Monterey Highlands 
School "decided they would have kids draw pictures of people being strangled 
and stuff, with little notations saying, 'Don't let this happen to me,' and 
mailed the whole package off to the governor." 
</P>
<P>
William Carroll, principal of Monterey Highlands School, said the PTA organized 
the letter campaign to the governor, but did not control what the children 
wrote or drew. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he shared the concern of parents and residents about a parole 
office in the middle of a residential neighborhood and only two blocks from his 
school. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, he appreciates the state's difficulty in finding a 
suitable site. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the fact that the school has experienced no problems with parolees 
since the office opened may be due to increased patrolling by police. 
</P>
<P>
The increased patrol has been a source of friction between police and the 
parole office. DiMaggio said Monterey Park and Alhambra police have acted 
unprofessionally, stationing patrol cars across from the parole office and 
harassing parolees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Increased 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy said police acted properly in increasing 
patrols to control crime and reassure residents. Both the Alhambra and Monterey 
Park police departments reported last year that crime increased after the 
parole office opened, but neither agency will comment now on the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the cities agreed to stop talking publicly about crime around the 
parole office after the state promised to close it. "We have kind of a pact 
with Monterey Park that we are not going to say any more," Murphy said. "We're 
not going to make any comments to inflame the controversy up north." 
</P>
<P>
"Up north" is Pasadena, where residents in Hastings Ranch collected more than 
4,300 signatures in a week on petitions to keep the parole office out of their 
neighborhood, after they discovered that the closure of the Alhambra office 
would be followed by the opening of an office at 468 N. Rosemead Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Ziol, one of the leaders of the Hastings Ranch opposition to the parole 
office, said that, since Alhambra and Monterey Park forced the parole office 
out of their community, she doesn't want it in Hastings Ranch either. "Who 
would want to force (the parole office) out, if crime had not become a real 
problem?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volume of Visits 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said that people incorrectly envision a large number of parolees 
visiting a parole office every day. He said there is some truth to that in 
urban offices, where many parolees are homeless and come in regularly. 
</P>
<P>
But at outlying offices in areas such as Pasadena and Alhambra, he said, parole 
agents spend most of their time in the field, seeing parolees at home or work. 
Parolees may go to the offices occasionally for drug testing, social services 
or some other reason, he said, but the number of parolees going to the office 
on a typical day would be no more than 25 or so. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Britton, president of the Lower Hastings Ranch Homeowners Assn., said he 
doubts the number would be as low as 25, but in any event, he doesn't want the 
state bringing felons into his neighborhood. About 700 of the 900 parolees who 
would be served by the Pasadena office live in Pasadena, but Britton said very 
few of them reside in Hastings Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said he is also concerned because the parole population is expanding 
rapidly, and the number of parolees being supervised by the local office could 
increase dramatically in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Parolees 
</P>
<P>
The large increase in the number of people sent to prison in the past decade is 
being reflected in the number of people being released on parole. Statewide, 
there were fewer than 20,000 people on parole from state prison at the end of 
1983, but that number has now reached 52,000, and is expected to climb to 
75,000 by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The state is planning to open 15 to 20 new parole offices statewide in the next 
year, and eight of them will be in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Veit said the state has rarely encountered opposition to parole offices 
elsewhere in the state. The East San Gabriel Valley is served by parole offices 
in West Covina that have drawn no complaint, said West Covina Police Chief 
Craig Meacham. 
</P>
<P>
Veit said one exception to the acceptance of parole offices occurred in El 
Cajon in San Diego County, where residents and the City Council fought the 
location of a parole office for three years, claiming that the safety of 
children attending nearby schools would be endangered by the presence of 
parolees. Last year, the state overrode the objections, told the city it had no 
legal right to block the parole office and moved parole agents in. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon City Manager Bob Acker said the office has been open a year now, 
without creating problems. He said there is no evidence that felons have 
committed crimes in the neighborhood before or after their parole office 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
"Having the parole office in town isn't that bad," Acker said. In fact, he 
said, the parole agents stationed there are an asset to local law enforcement. 
"The downside," he said "is that within the general community, we have a group 
of parolees coming in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternate Sites 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said several buildings are under consideration for the Pasadena 
office, in addition to the Rosemead Boulevard site. They include a 10-story 
office building on Lake Avenue near the Foothill Freeway, a former supermarket 
on Fair Oaks Avenue in Altadena and a commercial building at Lake Avenue and 
Union Street. DiMaggio said the building at Lake and Union is probably too 
small and lacks adequate parking, but the other two sites could be workable, 
although rents in the 10-story office building might be too high. 
</P>
<P>
The state needs an office with 9,000 to 12,000 square feet, ample parking, and 
access to public transportation. Pasadena city officials said they were told by 
parole officials that the office should not be placed too close to police and 
court buildings because that would make parolees nervous. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said some parolees might be reluctant to visit a parole office near a 
police station, but that is not a major concern in picking a site for a parole 
office. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said the state will continue to study the sites proposed in Pasadena 
and meet with city officials before arriving at a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier), who introduced a bill to restrict 
the location of parole offices after residents in Alhambra and Monterey Park 
complained about the Garvey Avenue site, has begun modifying his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the bill would have prohibited the placement of a parole office 
within three miles of a school or park unless the city or county government 
gives its approval. But parole officials complained that almost all of their 
offices are within three miles of a school or park. Michael Gomez, a senior 
consultant to Montoya, said the bill is being rewritten to require the 
Department of Corrections to develop formal guidelines for the location of 
probation offices and to prohibit their placement within 500 yards of a school, 
park or school bus stop unless they are separated by a freeway or some other 
barrier.

ALHAMBRA TO SELL HOSPITAL TO DOCTORS IF VOTERS OK IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have agreed to sell the financially plagued Alhambra Community 
Hospital to a group of doctors if voters approve the idea in a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council and the city Redevelopment Agency board decided to 
sell the 157-bed hospital at 100 S. Raymond Ave. to Alhambra Health Partners, 
composed of 81 doctors who work at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agency owns the hospital, the council's approval was also needed, 
said City Manager Kevin Murphy. If the hospital board approves the agreement, 
it is to be signed by the mayor and hospital authorities by Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the $13.6-million sale would transform the nonprofit 
facility into a private, for-profit hospital, said Ron Dahlgren, the hospital's 
administrator and chief executive officer of the doctors' group. 
</P>
<P>
Except for tentative plans to save money by closing a pharmacy and medical 
supply store near the hospital, there are no plans to reduce patient services 
and none to increase patient fees, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City to Be Reimbursed 
</P>
<P>
The doctors' group will reimburse the city $30,000 for the special election, 
which is proposed for the first week in August, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is crucial to the survival of the hospital, said Euphemia Rybicki, a 
hospital board member. "I would feel dreadful if that hospital were to close," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
A group of doctors opened the hospital in the 1920s at 206 S. Garfield Ave., 
near downtown. A new hospital was built on the Raymond Avenue site in 1974 as 
part of a $11.2-million redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency then became the owner of the hospital. The agency 
leases the building to the city, which subleases it to the Alhambra Hospital 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 the hospital, facing debts of $4.3 million, declared bankruptcy. Two 
years later it made arrangements to begin paying back rent to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when the corporation hired Alhambra Health Partners to manage the 
hospital, the facility has been operating at a break-even point except for the 
last few months, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in Medicare and Medi-Cal payments, coupled with the cost of providing 
uncompensated care to patients with no health insurance, have recently resulted 
in cash-flow problems and financial losses, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Since February, the hospital has been unable to pay its monthly rent of 
$103,000 to the city, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Its experience is typical of the dilemma facing hospitals nationwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, for example, Medicare payments now cover 96.3% of the cost of 
providing care, and Medi-Cal payments cover 66.7%, said Lori Aldrete, a 
spokeswoman for the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems, a 
Sacramento-based lobbying organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hospitals Are Losing' 
</P>
<P>
"When the government is paying less than cost, then all of a sudden hospitals 
are losing money," Aldrete said. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra Community has been especially hard hit by the cutbacks because 70% of 
the hospital's patients are under Medicare, said the Rev. George Cummings, 
treasurer of the hospital board. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's occupancy rate has been running at 35%. City officials estimate 
that a 65% to 70% occupancy rate is needed to break even. 
</P>
<P>
To save the hospital from default, the board decided to sell to the doctors' 
group, which represents 27% of the 300 doctors who are affiliated with the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the ownership would commit them more to using this hospital," Dahlgren 
said. He said the doctors, most of whom live within five miles of the hospital, 
want to buy it so they will have a suitable place to practice. 
</P>
<P>
The possible sale is welcomed by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding that the group of doctors would keep it as a community 
hospital," said Councilman Boyd Condie. "I don't think we're losing anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefit to City 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Murphy said the sale would help strengthen city finances by 
allowing the Redevelopment Agency to retire a 30-year bond issue that financed 
the construction. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the bond obligation has complicated financing proposals for other 
redevelopment projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital corporation plans to buy the facility from the Redevelopment 
Agency for $10.6 million and would sell it to the doctors' group for $13.6 
million, said board member Cummings. The corporation would use the $3-million 
difference to start a foundation that would support health programs for the 
community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great step forward," Cummings said. "Everybody is a winner in 
this."

GAY GROUP PRESENTS AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Carl Bean, founder of the Minority AIDS Project, and Virginia Uribe, a 
guidance counselor at Fairfax High School, this week were named man and woman 
of the year by the organization that sponsors the annual Los Angeles Gay and 
Lesbian Pride Celebration in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Street West, the nonprofit corporation that sponsors the 
celebration, presented the awards Tuesday at the Le Parc Hotel in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Bean, a Los Angeles minister, was recognized for his work in founding the 
Minority AIDS Project, which provides services to AIDS patients in the minority 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Uribe was selected for her work in establishing Project 10, a controversial 
program at Fairfax High School that provides special counseling to gay and 
lesbian students. 
</P>
<P>
An award named in honor of the late San Francisco Mayor George Moscone was 
presented to state Controller Gray Davis for "speaking out on behalf of gay and 
lesbian issues when it did not necessarily flatter him to do so," Christopher 
Street West spokesman David M. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Another award, named in honor of the late San Francisco Councilman Harvey Milk, 
went to nightclub owner and former West Hollywood City Council candidate Gene 
LaPietra. 
</P>
<P>
The LaPietra Foundation was instrumental in supporting the Chris Brownlee 
Hospice, an AIDS unit at Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park, Smith said.

More thought and planning goes into choosing an international sister city than 
one might imagine. Recommendations are made to the city council by various 
civic groups involved in international relations. Upon the council's approval, 
letters and forms are forwarded to the intended sibling for acceptance. After 
agreement is reached, there is an exchange of plaques commemorating the event 
and in some cases officials from the two cities visit each other to see how 
each conducts city business. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 29 foreign cities that have been adopted by Orange County (some of our 
towns have multiple sisters), Mexico and Japan lead the way with seven each. 
There are two each in New Zealand, Argentina, South Korea, Australia and 
France, and one in Italy, Canada, Colombia, Ireland and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley, Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo, Santa Ana, Seal Beach, Villa 
Park, Westminster and Yorba Linda do not have international sisters. But the 
rest of Orange County's cities have chosen the foreign counterparts listed at 
right:

SNAPSHOTS: SOVIET AND U.S. WOMEN TEACHERS FIND A COMMON CLASS OF PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Classes are too large, teachers are underpaid, and too few women are at the 
top, where decisions about teaching are made. So, a leading Soviet educator 
said, teachers in her country are organizing to improve their lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds just like home," lamented an American woman who was startled at the 
similarities of professional women in the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a surprise to find out we face the same issues," said Judy Cody, 
president of the Claremont school board. "I hope we learn from them how to 
handle problems of core curriculum and class size." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange took place at Pitzer College last week, when seven high-ranking 
professional women from the Soviet Union visited Claremont on what they believe 
was a history-making cultural and professional mission for women. 
</P>
<P>
During a spirited discussion, Valentina S. Mitina, head of an educational 
institute that is part of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said 90% of her 
country's public school teachers are women. When their workday ends, they are 
still burdened with lesson plans and papers to be corrected at home, where they 
usually must do most of the housework and child care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the prestige of teachers is not very high," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the Pitzer College audience noted similarities in the United States, 
where about 85% of all public education teachers are women. 
</P>
<P>
The visit was arranged by Claremont Women for Soviet-American Dialogue, 
organized last year to promote the status of women and understanding between 
the two nations. The Claremont Assn. for Mutual American-Soviet Understanding 
was a co-sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Copple, a Claremont High School language teacher who founded the 
organization, said this was the first time a group of Soviet women has come to 
the United States as part of a cultural exchange. Claremont women hope to make 
a similar visit to the Soviet Union next year. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors stayed with families in Claremont, spent a day in Los Angeles, 
gave several lectures and visited local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cultural similarities often surprised both groups, the Soviets and 
Americans focused on their differences, hoping for solutions to improve 
economic, social and cultural problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mitina marveled at public education for the handicapped at Claremont High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"You take so many ill and crippled children into the mainstream," she said. 
"It's not only good for them -- look what it does for the other students who 
are accustomed to them. In Russia, it is hard for some people to look at the 
handicapped because they don't come out into society. For us grown-ups, the 
heart is aching, and there are such tears for these children." 
</P>
<P>
Although educational reforms are taking place in the Soviet Union, Mitina said, 
there is no special education for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
But, she suggested that American education might be improved by the Soviet 
concept of collectivism. 
</P>
<P>
"We are mostly collective in everything, including education, and somehow we 
lost the individual approach, and we are working on that," she said. "But here, 
I think, a more collective approach would be a good thing. Your individual 
approach (in education) is extreme." 
</P>
<P>
Although she herself favors heavy emphasis on basic education, with fewer 
electives for high school students, Mitina said many Soviets favor the U.S. 
model of a wide variety of elective courses. 
</P>
<P>
Elena V. Klinova, a social scientist who heads a department in the Institute 
for Social Sciences in the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said the Soviet Union is 
ahead of the United States in providing maternity leave for women. 
</P>
<P>
"Maternity is recognized as a social function, and women have the right to paid 
leave," Klinova said. Soviet women are given 56 days of leave before and 56 
days after the birth of a child and receive a small allowance. She said she has 
proposed 70 days of leave both before and after giving birth, a larger 
allowance and longer paid leaves of absence for those who stay home to care for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
"But this won't improve women's careers," Klinova said, noting that "domestic 
work should be more equally distributed. I hope we will achieve equality in all 
spheres of life, but we must work hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
The women often mentioned perestroika, the name for Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's political and economic reforms, and glasnost, the country's new 
policy of political openness. 
</P>
<P>
That openness, evident at the Pitzer visit, was praised by some of the 
Americans who turned out by the hundreds for the week's many programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they would be a little more cautious," said Pitzer sophomore 
Michelle Castrovinci. "I learned they're fighting for the same things we are."

LAND SWORN IN AS MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the city faces tough decisions in the coming year, Abbe Land was sworn 
in as mayor Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Land, who easily won reelection last year to a four-year term on the City 
Council, replaces Councilwoman Helen Albert in the largely ceremonial role as 
mayor. The position is rotated annually among the five council members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Koretz, the newest member of the council who was elected last 
year, was appointed mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Land cited parking, a city transit study, a proposed garbage collection system 
and expected budgetary constraints as among the difficult issues the city faces 
in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, our fifth year (of cityhood), promises to be one in which we have a 
lot of decisions regarding a lot of different things that we've been working on 
for the last five years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Land, who has enjoyed support from the politically influential Coalition for 
Economic Survival, a renters' rights group, was first elected to the council in 
1986 to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor Valerie Terrigno, who resigned 
after being convicted of embezzlement.

GROUP SUES L.A. COUNTY

<P>
The Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains are suing Los Angeles County over the 
development of 150 single-family homes at the site of the former Renaissance 
Pleasure Faire in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, similar to one filed this month by the Sierra Club and the Las 
Virgenes Homeowners Foundation, seeks to reverse a March ruling by the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors that would allow development of the 
320-acre tract north of the Paramount Ranch land that is part of the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits argue that the ruling did not take into account problems of 
drainage, traffic and the destruction of the view from the recreation area.

Photo, Passover Is Special for Soviet Jews The Bureau of Jewish Education 
gathered recent Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union to share with them the 
traditions of Passover last Sunday. The eight-day commemoration of the flight 
of the Jews from Egypt, which started Wednesday evening, has special meaning 
for Jews who struggled to leave the Soviet Union. In learning the ritual for 
the two Seder meals, which are held on the first two nights of Passover, some 
of the immigrants munched dried fruit and nuts and heard a Russian Chabad 
cantor. Yonaton Schultz, bottom, discussed the traditional meals, during which 
portions of the Book of Exodus are read and foods symbolizing Jewish 
experiences are served with kosher wine. Schultz's young son nibbled on matzo 
while listening to his father. SANDRA TATUM / Los Angeles Times

STUDY SAYS SENIORS BENEFIT MORE FROM THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Far from being set in their ways, older people may be more inclined to change 
their approach to life than younger people, an Oxnard clinical psychologist has 
concluded after studying the effects of psychotherapy on the elderly at a 
Ventura County clinic. 
</P>
<P>
In studies conducted over three years, Robert Knight found that elderly 
patients, a group that had sometimes been considered too confused to respond to 
psychological treatment, benefited from therapy more than younger patients. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, 38, found that patients older than 60 were more likely than younger 
patients to show psychological improvement, based on the Global Assessment 
Scale, a standardized gauge of psychological functioning. He found that equally 
impressive results could be obtained from patients older than 80 by simply 
increasing their therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Older people don't seem to be resistant to change in the same way as younger 
people," said Knight, who recently became an associate professor of gerontology 
and psychology at USC. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Knight studied 231 clinic patients, with an average age of 72, and 
found that more than half improved after six months of psychotherapy. Two years 
later, he compared the results of psychotherapy on a sampling of 125 patients 
with other researchers' studies of 1,200 adults under the age of 60, who had 
been drawn from other Ventura County clinics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Findings Hailed 
</P>
<P>
Gerontologists and psychologists who treat the elderly were enthusiastic to 
learn of Knight's findings, which will be published as a book entitled 
"Outreach With the Elderly: Community Education, Assessment and Therapy" this 
summer by New York University Press. 
</P>
<P>
"We've felt that older people were receptive to therapy, but we haven't had a 
clear confirmation," said Robert Kastenbaum, a professor of gerontology at 
Arizona State University. "If he's documented this, then it would be a valuable 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments were echoed by Barbara Roth, director of Ventura County's 
Senior Outreach Program, the publicly funded mental health clinic where the 
studies were conducted from 1981 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a tendency to give up on older adults," said Roth, whose clinic 
last year treated 2,000 older people in their homes or at its Main Street 
office in Ventura. "They conclude that they're older and set in their ways. 
It's like, 'Why bother?' 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, they're really rewarding," she said. "I've seen some incredibly ill 
people who would have been put in nursing homes or killed themselves if they 
hadn't gotten treatment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Programs for Elderly 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who served as the program's director until taking the USC post last 
fall, hopes that his book will encourage providers of mental health to tailor 
more programs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
While the elderly made up 11% of the population nationwide, they accounted for 
only 6% of the people who sought psychological counseling, according to a 1983 
study cited in "Outreach." 
</P>
<P>
The need for such programs is expected to escalate with the graying of America, 
Knight said. In the 10 years since the founding of Senior Outreach Program, 
which was one of the first state-funded mental health clinics for the elderly, 
the county's senior population has doubled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said the elderly may respond better to therapy because of their "wealth 
of information about the self and other people." He added that they are not 
distracted to the same extent as younger people by work and family pressures. 
The realization that time is running out may give the elderly a stronger 
incentive to adjust or adapt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If life has been painful," he said, "you'd like to have some good years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prejudice Cited 
</P>
<P>
Mental health professionals may have overlooked the elderly because of 
prejudice against them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many feel that the desire of a 70-year-old to commit suicide is reasonable, 
whereas the same desire at 32 is senseless and tragic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A tendency by elderly people to describe emotional ills in physical terms 
hasn't helped matters, Knight said. Physicians who find no physiological basis 
for the complaints often incorrectly conclude that the patient is well, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a 1982 study found that 60% of older people with physical complaints 
were found to have a mental disorder. Knight, who no longer sees patients, said 
he observed numerous examples in his 10-year practice. 
</P>
<P>
One older woman, who was upset about her marriage of 45 years, complained to 
Knight of pains in her chest, arms and legs. A man in his mid-80s refused to 
walk long after his physician believed that he had recovered from a mild fall. 
In therapy, he revealed that he was severely depressed about the death of his 
wife of 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Sad, Depressed' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of older people are just sad, depressed, not going out much," Knight 
said. "They wonder if it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Others, he said, suffer from the stress of having to care for aging spouses and 
parents, or have long-term emotional illnesses that have grown worse through 
lack of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The current generation of older people were well into middle age by the time 
psychiatry and counseling were widely available," Knight said. "Most of them 
think of mental health in terms of the state hospital system." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly have more trouble getting to and paying their therapists. "Many are 
either poor or feel that they should save their funds for future health 
crises," Knight wrote in his book. 
</P>
<P>
In "Outreach With the Elderly," Knight recommends that mental health clinics 
follow the model set by the Senior Outreach Program, which sends therapists to 
half of its patients' homes and helps the elderly apply for public assistance 
to pay for treatment.

LIFE ON WHEELS: CARS SPROUT ANTENNAS AS CELLULAR PHONES RING OUT THROUGH THE 
SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, Kimberly Hubbard of Newport Beach did ask her husband to give her a ring 
for her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
But a car phone? 
</P>
<P>
Somehow that wasn't quite what she had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I could never reach her at home," says Kimberly's husband, Scott. Between 
shuttling their four children to and from school and running household errands, 
she spends a good part of her day behind the wheel of her Mercedes-Benz station 
wagon. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my big problem is keeping her off the phone with her girlfriends," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimberly didn't hide her disappointment when she saw her gift. "I said, 
'No, no, no, this is not my birthday present.' So he took me to get the ring 
too." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really worked out great," Kimberly says. "We bought a house and (the car 
phone) made going through escrow so much easier, because I had to take papers 
here and there. We went on vacation to San Francisco and called our friends 
(from the car) to get directions to their house." 
</P>
<P>
Forget the stereotype: The guy in the business suit in the BMW isn't the only 
driver who's gone cellular these days. Now that car phones are available for as 
little as $500 and cellular dealers are becoming as common as yogurt shops and 
nail parlors, more and more cars are sprouting those squiggly little antennas. 
</P>
<P>
(Drivers who want the status but don't need -- or can't afford -- the service 
can get a phony phone. Last year a company called Faux Systems in San Francisco 
started selling fake cellular sets, with inoperative antennas and plastic phone 
shells, for $9.95.) 
</P>
<P>
"At first, cellular was so new that a lot of people were intimidated by it," 
says Angie Wolfer, sales manager for Cellular USA in Santa Ana. "But now that 
people are getting used to it, it's not so much a luxury item anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Way back in the dawn of cellular (the technology was introduced in 1981 and 
became widely available here beginning in 1983), most customers were male 
business professionals, Wolfer says. "More women are buying phones now. And 
people who aren't white-collar; construction guys are putting them in their 
trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfer estimates that about a fourth of the car phones she now sells are being 
purchased primarily for personal, not business, purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Although statistical breakdowns are not available specifically for Orange 
County, the greater Los Angeles area has the highest number of car phones in 
the nation, according to Linda Leavitt, a spokeswoman for LA Cellular, one of 
two companies that provide cellular service here. The other is Irvine-based 
PacTel Cellular. 
</P>
<P>
California has 225,000 cellular subscribers, which account for a fifth of the 
national total. Leavitt says neither company will release exact figures on the 
number of subscribers in the Los Angeles area. "It has to be proprietary, 
because the competition is so hot." 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Gallardo, owner of Communications 'r' Us, which does business in both 
Orange and Los Angeles counties, says about 7,000 new lines are being added 
every month in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Leavitt says, car phones cost about $3,000 and there were only 125,000 
cellular subscribers in the United States. Last year that number rose to 2.1 
million, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. And those 
customers spent nearly $3.2 billion to make calls. 
</P>
<P>
Car phones are nothing new, of course. But with the pre-cellular mobile 
telephone system, every car call had to go through an operator, and the 
connections were often less than ideal. 
</P>
<P>
Like the old system, cellular uses radio waves, which are relayed by a grid of 
antennas, each covering a small geographic area called a cell. The cell 
antennas relay a call from a car unit to a mobile telephone switching office, 
which automatically routes the call. As you travel from one cell to another, 
your call is automatically switched to the next antenna. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers are affiliated with both PacTel Cellular and LA Cellular; others 
represent only one. Rates for both companies are identical, being regulated by 
the Public Utilities Commission, according to Wolfer. 
</P>
<P>
Because charges are based on air time, cellular phone users are billed for both 
incoming and outgoing calls. "There are three plans," Wolfer says. "The one 
that's mostly for business users is $45 a month for the basic service, then 45 
cents a minute during peak hours, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 
27 cents a minute evenings and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"For people who don't need to make many calls during business hours, there's a 
plan that costs $25 a month, plus 90 cents a minute during peak hours and 20 
cents the rest of the time. Or for callers who use the phone more than 15 
minutes a day, there's the premium plan that costs $239 a month for 550 minutes 
of air time. The premium plan also includes call forwarding, call waiting and 
conference calling." 
</P>
<P>
Calls to anywhere in the 714, 213 and 818 area codes are considered local for 
cellular purposes. Long distance is measured by your area code, not where your 
car happens to be when you make a call. So when the Hubbards were in San 
Francisco and called their friends there, the call was long distance. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have answering machines on their car phones and others have the 
phone's ringer tied in to the horn, Wolfer says. Otherwise, "when you're out of 
the car, the phone's off. Or you can turn it off any time when you're driving." 
</P>
<P>
There are three types of cellular phones, Wolfer says. The least expensive is 
called a fixed mobile, which means it is permanently installed in a car. Fixed 
mobile phones cost between $500 and $1,200, she says. The next level is 
transportables, which can be moved from car to car. Those cost $1,000 to 
$1,500, she says. The most expensive are hand-held cellular phones, which can 
be carried in a pocket. They cost between $1,300 and $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
Installation (about $150 for all types) is extra. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers make most of their money not on the phones themselves but on the 
monthly phone bills. Gallardo says he gets $200 to $250 from LA Cellular every 
time he signs up a new customer, plus 5% of the monthly bill for as long as 
that customer subscribes. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting rich in this business," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But what about safety? Isn't it distracting, trying to drive and talk on the 
phone at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
Although not many studies have been done on car phone safety so far, the early 
reports have found no problems. The Automobile Assn. of America and the 
California Highway Patrol both concluded that car phones pose no direct traffic 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
They may even help make highways safer. Drivers often use their car phones to 
report emergencies and road hazards, according to the CHP, which found that 98% 
of the calls to 911 from car phones were valid emergencies, compared to only 
39% of the 911 calls from land lines. 
</P>
<P>
Safety was a big reason Rhonda DeTorres Nobles of Fountain Valley got her car 
phone. Her husband, Anthony, already had a phone in his car for business 
purposes. But 2 years ago when she was pregnant with their first child, they 
had a phone installed in her car. Now she is expecting a second child; Rhonda 
said, "Next week we're getting a mini-van and we'll have a phone installed in 
it as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We never use the phones for social calls and we don't give out the numbers," 
she says. Still, her monthly bill is about $150 and her husband's usually is 
more than $200. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wondered if it's worth it, but we just feel more secure this way. If I'm 
out in the middle of the freeway with the baby in the car and I'm late, he 
worries. This way there's almost no time when we're out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel much safer with a car phone, night or day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Meyer, also of Fountain Valley, says her car phone was a gift from her 
husband. A Realtor, Meyer says the phone has increased her business by about 
20%. But she says it also makes her feel more secure. "Many times it is 
necessary for me to have late night appointments," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I leave the appointment I can call home and assure my husband that 
I am on my way home. I would not stop at a pay phone late at night to call 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Anderson of Irvine thinks most drivers who have car phones don't really 
need them. "I do not have one, will not have one and feel perhaps one in 1,000 
and less are, probably, in truth, justified. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the President of the United States has a constitutional 
requirement to be in touch and available (and hopefully rational) 100% of the 
time. From there I think the need goes down exponentially." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watch Out! Slow Down! Turn Left! 
</P>
<P>

DISCOVERY: AT MILKSHAKE MECCA, GET IT WHILE IT'S COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Good news for those of you who don't think you can go through a summer without 
a monkey flip: The Sunshine Cove is still in business. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to hurry, though. Virginia McKinney, the longtime owner of this 
venerable roadside stop on Coast Highway, said her lease from the state is up 
June 30. From that day on, the future of the milkshake mecca of Orange County 
is expected to be dicey. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, McKinney said, plan eventually to widen the highway, which 
would displace the small, bright-yellow shack that has stood at the same 
turnout since 1945 above Crystal Cove, northwest of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But lovers of the ice cream date shake, large bags of nuts, peanut butter 
chocolate chip pie and the ever-popular monkey flip are trying to rescue their 
hangout by circulating a petition, said McKinney, who has run the business for 
the last 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm and loyalty that locals and even passers-by feel toward the 
Sunshine Cove can be seen on almost any weekend -- particularly during warm, 
sunny weather -- when the tiny parking area is packed with cars and a line of 
shake-hungry motorists snakes back from the window. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiches, smoked fish, various nuts, cakes, pies, bagged corn chips and other 
items are sold, but it is the shakes -- listed on a long menu board attached to 
the front of the shack -- that are the biggest draw, McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the more exotic ice cream shake offerings (watch out, McDonald's) are 
date, boysenberry, blueberry, raspberry, banana, almond, apple-cinnamon, 
nectarine and peanut butter, all made with fresh fruit or true ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
And, near the bottom of the menu, is the monkey flip, perhaps the most exotic 
mix of all. 
</P>
<P>
"The lifeguards used to come here all the time and get that one," McKinney 
said. "We called it that because it has enough calories in it to make a monkey 
flip." It is made from bananas, dates, peanut butter and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunshine Cove would be merely a curiosity, a good place for a quick bite, 
if it were located in, say, Buena Park. But because it is perched on one of the 
more picturesque overlooks on the county coastline -- nestled in a dip in the 
highway in the peaceful open land between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach -- 
the food and drink are just half the draw. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the stand is a slightly raised deck, with built-in tables and benches 
that overlook the cove and ocean beyond. More than a snacker's paradise, the 
deck holds appeal even for the pinstripe crowd, McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," she said, "business people get tired of going to restaurants, and 
they like to go somewhere where they can take off their coats and feel relaxed, 
out in the open air, so they come down here. Sometimes they even call ahead of 
time. Some people have even held sales meetings here." 
</P>
<P>
One caveat: Parking is tricky. The area in front of the Sunshine Cove is not so 
much a parking lot as a turnout on Coast Highway. It is often full. But, 
McKinney said, if you drive another mile down the highway and turn back, a 
space will probably have opened up. 
</P>
<P>
It may take a pass or two, but that will seem less tedious when a true monkey 
flip is the reward.

ASK THE VET: NAIL TRIMS CUTS KITTY'S SCRATCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: What is the proper way to trim my cat's nails? I don't want to have her 
de-clawed, yet she frequently scratches me or my furniture. I have heard that 
keeping her nails clipped short will help reduce this problem, but I want to 
make sure I am doing this the right way. I tried one time and caused her to 
bleed. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Siegel, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: To help keep your kitty from damaging you and the furniture, frequent nail 
trims will reduce your cat's need to scratch. You should take her to your 
veterinarian or groomer and have him show you the correct method. They should 
also show you the proper way to hold a nail clipper. You need to extend each 
nail by gently pushing on the pad. This way you should be able to see the quick 
of the nail which has the blood vessel and nerve -- which you don't want to 
cut. You can cut or trim off the tip of the nail below the quick without the 
risk of hurting your cat. Hold your cat on your lap or on a secure surface to 
keep her supported. If you should cut the nail too close and cause it to bleed, 
you can apply commercially available agents such as Kwik-stop, to the tip of 
the nail to stop the bleeding. Start off by just tipping the nails until you 
feel comfortable about trimming them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a year-old, beautiful, longhaired cat who lately has been retching at 
various intervals. She was able to eject a fur ball at one time. Is there some 
method, treatment or medication that can be used to make the expulsion of fur 
balls more bearable for her? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chloe B. Culver, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A: Fur balls are common to all cats but seem to be more prevalent in longhaired 
cats that groom themselves more frequently. As a cat licks herself, she will 
swallow a portion of the hair that is stuck to her tongue. This hair starts to 
collect in the stomach and is either vomited or passed on in the feces. In some 
severe cases, the hair mass collects and can cause an intestinal obstruction 
which may have to be surgically removed. 
</P>
<P>
The best methods for controlling hair that is swallowed is to groom your cat 
daily to remove most of the loose hair that she would normally lick off 
herself. Give her any one of the laxative medications that come in tubes two to 
three times a week to help her pass any accumulated hair. If your cat stops 
eating and appears to be ill, have her seen by your veterinarian.

SPORTSSCOPE: BRONCO NINE FACES TWO CRUCIAL GAMES WITH NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is still nearly a month remaining in the conference season, but the Cal 
Poly Pomona baseball team will have two important games against California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. rival Cal State Northridge today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, 10-8 in conference play and 16-23 overall, will visit Northridge 
at 3 p.m. today and play host to the Matadors at 3 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is in second place in the conference and Northridge, 9-8-1 in the CCAA 
and 20-12-1 overall, is in third. With Cal Poly San Luis Obispo leading the 
conference at 12-7, the Pomona-Northridge loser could see its CCAA title hopes 
fade. 
</P>
<P>
The teams have split in two meetings, Northridge winning 9-8 and Pomona 5-3. 
Both entered the week having won five of their last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona had won five in a row before dropping a double-header to Chapman, 4-1 
and 10-6. In the second game, senior catcher Chris Goldbach of the Broncos saw 
his hitting streak snapped at 30 games, the second longest hitting streak in 
school history, one behind Larry Beardman in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Goldbach leads the Broncos with his .411 batting average, six home runs and 44 
runs batted in. He is hitting .526 in CCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona outfielder Chris Butterfield is hitting .393. Pitcher Wayne Koklys has a 
2-0 record and 1.42 earned-run average in CCAA games. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ranked No. 10 in NCAA Division II, has been led by freshman second 
baseman Craig Clayton with a .343 batting average and senior designated hitter 
Chae-Ho Chung, who has eight home runs and 22 RBIs. The top pitcher for the 
Matadors is senior Ron Wheatcroft, who is 8-2 with a 3.74 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors have a 7-3 record against Division I teams, including a 4-2 win 
over 12th-ranked Fresno State last week. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-open race for the Golden State Athletic Conference baseball title, 
the top four teams are separated by only one game. 
</P>
<P>
But that could change when two of the leaders, Azusa Pacific University and 
Westmont, meet in a double-header at noon Saturday in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont entered the week in first place in the GSAC at 12-5 and is 23-13 
overall. Azusa Pacific is 11-5 and 23-14. 
</P>
<P>
The teams have been among the traditional powers in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics District III in recent years. Azusa Pacific defeated 
Westmont for the District III title last year but Westmont has won 10 of the 
last 14 games between them. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa beat Westmont 8-6 this season but dropped an 18-9 decision March 21. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa, the top hitting team in the GSAC, is sparked by junior catcher Carlos 
Salazar and senior utility player Dan Hornbuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont will counter with one of the top pitching staffs in the conference. 
The leaders are seniors Jeff Ludwig and Lucky Arviso. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa has been led in pitching by Ron Bush, who is 9-1 with a 2.67 ERA, and 
Jose Gallardo, 4-2 with a 4.40 ERA. In GSAC play Bush is 5-0 with a 2.38 ERA 
and Gallardo 4-1 with a 1.60 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars also visit District III rival Biola in a non-conference game at 
2:30 p.m. today in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
After splitting two games with third-ranked Fresno State last week, the Cal 
Poly Pomona women's softball team will have a rematch with the Bulldogs in a 
double-header at 1 p.m. Sunday at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, ranked No. 13 in NCAA Division I, entered this week 28-17 overall and 
16-8 in the Big West Conference. Fresno State is 36-9 overall and 14-4 in the 
Big West. The Broncos defeated Fresno, 2-1, before losing to the Bulldogs, 3-0, 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have received outstanding pitching from senior Lori Thompson and 
sophomore Nicky Luce. Thompson is 13-6 with an 0.81 ERA and five shutouts and 
Luce is 13-8 with a 1.17 ERA and seven shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno has a solid one-two pitching combination in All-American Carie Dever and 
freshman Terry Carpenter. Dever has a 16-4 record and Carpenter is 20-4 with a 
minuscule 0.58 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs have a strong hitter in shortstop Martha Noffsinger, who has a 
.372 average. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona catcher Denise Correa is batting .305 with a team-high seven doubles and 
six triples. Outfielder Nikki Busch and freshman shortstop Shellie McCall lead 
the team with 19 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona concludes its road trip with a double-header against Pacific (20-21, 
4-14) at 5 p.m. Monday at Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Los Angeles baseball team will try to stay within reach of the 
conference leaders when it plays California Collegiate Athletic Assn. games 
against UC Riverside on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The teams play at 7:30 p.m. Friday in Riverside and 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Cal 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State entered the week in fourth place in the conference with an 8-9 record 
and 18-22 overall. But the Golden Eagles are only three games behind 
first-place Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (12-7). Riverside entered the week at 
8-10-1 in the CCAA and 16-21-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles have been led by the pitching of freshman Paul Spere, an 
All-CIF Southern Section performer from Diamond Bar High School who has a 4-1 
record, and senior Mike Utke. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the team has been paced by outfielders Rex De La Nuez and Frank 
James, catcher Martin Tourville and second baseman Ed Pimental. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's leaders include outfielder Jeff Goodale, first baseman Logan 
Ostrander and third baseman Mike Eatinger.

RICK DAVIS -- HE HAD A SECRET; 
</P>
<P>
THAT IS, UNTIL HE TOOK THE MOUND AGAINST 2ND-RANKED ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rick Davis stepped to the mound Feb. 6 at Arizona, ranked second in the 
country, he was the best-kept pitching secret in college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a senior right-hander from Upland, had been a shortstop a year before 
for Cal State Dominguez Hills. But he beat Arizona, 2-1, striking out 12. 
</P>
<P>
The outing elevated him in the eyes of major league scouts, and the next time 
he threw, his parents counted at least 10 radar guns aimed at their 22-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a pretty good-looking prospect," said Dodger scout Bobby Darwin. "He has 
a good shot at making the pros." 
</P>
<P>
Davis (5-4) says he knew he could pitch but that few would listen. He has 
pleaded his case for a starting role since he entered Mt. San Antonio College 
in Walnut four years ago. Trouble is, he was too valuable at shortstop last 
year at Dominguez Hills and in junior college. He was a modest 3-0 at Mt. Sac 
as a pitcher and made only a brief appearance in a mop-up role last year for 
the struggling Toros, who went 19-30. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 170-pound senior has believers, though. Said his father, Roger: "I 
knew he could pitch. He's been pitching since he started baseball when he was 
7." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is thought to have his best chance of getting into pro ball as a short 
reliever. His earned-run average is hovering at 2.84 and he has broken the Toro 
single-season record for strikeouts (125). 
</P>
<P>
Davis is considered a find because most top-flight prospects sign pro contracts 
right out of high school, scouts say. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Davis so appealing is his command of three pitches: the fastball, a 
slow curve and his best pitch, a knuckle curve. 
</P>
<P>
The knuckle curve "looks like a fastball and all of a sudden the bottom just 
drops out," explained Dominguez Hills Coach George Wing. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who adapted the pitch from a friend while playing American Legion ball, 
says the rotation has a six-to-12-inch drop. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitch comes easy to me," Davis said. "But some guys just can't throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis uses it to set up his fastball, which reportedly has been clocked at 
about 85 miles an hour, not your Nolan Ryan variety. 
</P>
<P>
"He has good ability (with his pitches)," Darwin said. "That's something you 
rarely see." 
</P>
<P>
And Davis likes to throw, nibbling at the corners of the plate. In a 
complete-game victory this season he tossed 168 pitches -- a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that we are going to have to give Rick the ball more," said 
Wing. "We discovered he is less effective when he pitches on a weekly basis. He 
needs to pitch a couple of times each week." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is excited about that prospect: "My arm is capable of throwing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
So far this season, Davis has a good strikout-to-walk ratio, 125 to 47 in 
104-plus innings. He also has two shutouts. Darwin was the first scout to see 
Davis pitch, but "when a guy's got ability, the news is going to travel fast." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is aglow at the sudden attention: "I'm kind of surprised at the success. 
I'm even more surprised with the statistical part of it. I always thought I 
could pitch." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time he thought he'd be drafted as a shortstop. He almost signed 
with Oakland after leaving Mt. Sac, but recurring muscle injuries made him 
think twice. 
</P>
<P>
He wound up at Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills thanks to an acquaintance 
of Toro Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, who recommended him to then-Coach Andy 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
But again, John Rouse, a sometimes volunteer coach at Mt. Sac, told Lopez that 
Davis was a fine fielding shortstop, not a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the ideal fit for Dominguez Hills," Lopez said. "He was two players in 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez spent the better part of last year filling out a lineup card that covered 
for eight major injuries and, of course, Davis was needed at shortstop. At 
times that was a sore spot for both. "He's a great kid," Lopez said. "He'll 
make somebody look good if they draft him." 
</P>
<P>
But there was a lot of friction between Lopez and Davis, although both say that 
is past. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted me to be more of a leader in the infield," Davis said. "I felt more 
pressure from him. I'm a quiet guy." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, aware that Davis wanted to pitch but desperately in need of fielders, 
never handed him the ball even as the season rapidly slipped away to injuries. 
And he rode him constantly: "I was on him a lot last year. I thought he could 
go a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Lopez's intentions eventually made him a better person, but he 
blames Lopez for a poor showing that included 27 errors and only a .210 batting 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself trying to understand what he wanted out of me rather than 
playing my game," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
And Lopez wondered if he was being too intense with Davis: "I had a lot of 
quiet moments when I thought that maybe I was tightening him up too much." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was disappointed with the result: "After that year I said I had to do 
something amazing to get back into it. I guess that has been pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Late last spring Davis got his break. Lopez left for a Division I job at 
Pepperdine, and Davis thought he had one last shot to convince the Toros' new 
coach, Wing, that pitching was his forte. He joined a summer Baseball Congress 
of America team in Santa Maria and had a stellar summer -- at shortstop. He did 
not pitch. Back at Dominguez Hills in the fall, he wondered if he would ever 
get the job he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
But things were in the works that Davis did not know about. As the coach at 
Cosumnes River Community College, Wing had heard that Davis had pitching 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Even before I met Rick, I talked to a few coaches who stated that he could 
pitch," Wing said. "I didn't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Dominguez would be thin on pitching, Wing sent Davis to the bullpen 
"to see what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
In early October Wing was convinced, although when the preseason media guide 
was released, Davis got no more mention than as a third starter. He has evolved 
into the ace of the staff, although when he pitches the Toros have problems 
scoring runs and holding leads. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31 at Cal Poly Pomona he struck out 10 but lost, 3-1. In a return 
engagement a bloop single and an error helped erase a 4-2 lead in the bottom of 
the ninth. Davis had no decision and the team lost in 10 innings, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Davis' success, Wing found it difficult to think of him as anything 
other than an infielder at first, particularly since he had taken up switch 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"We drooled over him as a shortstop," Wing said. "He has adjusted to the 
situation much better than I thought. He put the bat away completely. He never 
takes batting practice anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Davis may have gotten to the mound sooner had he pushed his point, but that is 
not his nature. Said his mother, Rosanne: "Rick is not pushy. He sits back and 
says, 'The coach knows best,' instead of being right up in his face and saying, 
'I can pitch.' " 
</P>
<P>
Davis will most likely be drafted this June, although how high he goes depends 
on a lot of things, according to Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
By now most scouts quit hanging around college teams and go in search of other 
prospects. Now their radar guns are pointed at potential high school pitching 
stars. For now Davis' world is quiet again, his ability on the mound no longer 
a secret.

ST. FRANCIS GRADUATE ADDS GLITTER TO IRISH DIAMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Lund is surrounded by tradition at Notre Dame where there are almost as many 
legends as trees. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is Knute Rockne, the Four Horsemen and Win One for the Gipper. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Lou Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is national championships -- football championships. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, therefore, is not the place baseball players reared in Southern 
California continue their careers. At least it wasn't when Lund graduated from 
St. Francis High in 1986 and took off for South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
You want Notre Dame baseball tradition? The Fighting Irish made it to the NCAA 
tournament five years in a row from 1956-60. End of story. 
</P>
<P>
Lund, however, has been part of a transformation that is allowing Notre Dame 
baseball players to not only bask beneath the Golden Dome but also in the Top 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Lund, a 6-2, 200-pound catcher from Pasadena, is batting .280 with three home 
runs and 24 runs batted in for the Fighting Irish, who are ranked 27th in the 
poll produced by Collegiate Baseball magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the student who said he visited Notre Dame when he was a junior in 
high school because "I grew up in a Catholic family and was always hearing 
about Notre Dame" is getting the education he always wanted and attention from 
professional baseball scouts that he yearned for almost as much. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to tell me when I was a freshman that I would be at this point, I 
would have never believed you," Lund said. "It's been a big turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the credit for the revitalization of the program has gone to Coach Pat 
Murphy, 30, a lifelong Fighting Irish fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy took the job last year after two successful seasons at Claremont 
College, where he led his team to its first Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference title in 11 years, and coaching the national team from the 
Netherlands to the European championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"His energy has no bounds," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said of Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, with a nucleus of players that went 15-29 during Lund's freshman 
season, the Fighting Irish finished 39-22. 
</P>
<P>
"In our first team meeting, he (Murphy) was very intense, very straightforward 
and very honest about the way the program was going to be run and how things 
were going to be done his way," Lund said. "You could tell right away that he 
didn't want to be our buddy or our friend. He wanted to be our coach to help us 
win and become better baseball players." 
</P>
<P>
An All-Del Rey League outfielder at St. Francis, where he batted .360 in his 
senior year, Lund has blossomed as a catcher -- a position he was unable to 
play in high school because of the presence of teammate Sam Vranjes, now the 
starting catcher for USC. 
</P>
<P>
Lund and Vranjes may meet when the Fighting Irish and Trojans clash in a 
two-game series scheduled for next fall in South Bend -- a few days before the 
schools' football teams play. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy arranged a similar series with Miami last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame swept the series and beat the 14th-ranked Hurricanes again in March 
during a spring trip to Florida. The Irish have also defeated 10th-ranked Texas 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see some recognition and it's nice to see the hard work paying 
off," said Lund, who is majoring in finance. "But we can't dwell on that 
because we have a long way to go."

BRUINS RUN OUT OF DUAL TRACK TRIUMPHS AT 42; MT. SAC MEET NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's track team's streak of victories in dual meets was stopped last 
week at 42, but the Bruins remain unbeaten in 43 meets dating to the end of the 
1984 season. 
</P>
<P>
In a triangular meet with dual scoring last week, the Bruins defeated Houston, 
97-57, to tie the school record of 42 straight dual-meet victories, set from 
1972 through 1976. But UCLA tied Louisiana State, 77-77, and had to win the 
last event, the 1,600-meter relay, to gain the tie. The Bruins won the 
triangular with 73 points to 70 for LSU and 49 for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Marsh and Steve Lewis were held out of individual events because of 
hamstring injuries, but both ran legs on the 1,600 relay team as UCLA turned in 
a season-best 3:06.2 to win. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Knight also was nursing a hamstring but still won both hurdle events and 
set a personal record of 50.54 in the 400 hurdles. Other Bruins who did well 
included Christian Cushing-Murray, who won the 1,500-meter run in a 
personal-best 3:42.81, and David Wilson, who set meet records in winning the 
hammer throw at 218-1 and the shot put at 61-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (4-0-1 in dual meets this season) will compete Saturday and Sunday 
in the 31st annual Mt. San Antonio College Relays. Marsh, Lewis and several 
others may be held out to rest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In a double-dual meet last week, the UCLA women, who will also be in the Mt. 
Sac relays, defeated LSU, 85-51, and Houston, 94-43, running their dual-meet 
record to 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for the NCAA championships last week were Bruins Kris Larson, 
Janeene Vickers and Julie Johnson. Larson had a mark of 175-2 in winning the 
discus, Vickers ran a 58-flat 400 hurdles and Johnson did the 800 in 2:05.7. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's and women's track teams will compete today in 
the Mt. Sac relays and be in a triangular meet on Friday with Santa Barbara 
City and Valley at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's and women's swim teams (both 7-0 and 5-0 in the 
Western State Conference) will end regular-season competition at Pierce at 2:30 
p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the teams posted wins over Ventura, the women by a 76-51 margin and 
the men by 54-46. 
</P>
<P>
Corsair Robert Hudek won three events, taking the 200-yard freestyle in 
1:47.59, the 500 free in 4:52.78 and the 1,000 free in 10:32.06. 
</P>
<P>
SMC's Cecilia Henricksen and Andrea Bardin were double winners. Henricksen took 
firsts in the 50-yard butterfly (27.38) and the 100 fly (59.27), and Bardin won 
the 50 freestyle in 25.4 and the 100 free in 53.46. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's women's softball team, ranked second nationally, will play Pacific 10 
Conference double-headers Friday at Arizona State and Saturday at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins (29-2 overall and 9-1 in the Pac-10) swept double-headers 
from U.S. International and No. 3 Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine baseball team (28-13-1 overall and 13-3 in the West Coast 
Athletic Conference) will take a break from conference play this week and next. 
The Waves will play host to U.S. International in a double-header at noon 
Saturday and play at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Waves, winners of 11 of their last 12 games, won three of four 
conference road games against Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine pitcher Britt Craven, after losing his first two starts, has won 
seven straight and has a 3.72 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College baseball team (14-21 overall, 5-10 in the WSC as the 
week began) will play today at Moorpark and play host to Glendale at 1 p.m. 
Saturday at Marine Park. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Corsairs lost to College of the Canyons, 14-12; Santa Barbara, 
6-5, and Ventura, 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Soto leads the Corsairs with a .430 batting average, and teammate Travis 
Woods is hitting .409. 
</P>
<P>
After running its win streak to 15 matches with a 5-3 victory over USC, the 
top-ranked UCLA men's tennis team will be in the Bay Area this weekend. The 
Bruins (23-1, 8-0 in the Pac-10) will play No. 2 Cal (18-5, 3-4) Friday and No. 
7 Stanford (12-4, 5-2) Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Trojans, All-American senior Pat Galbraith had a big day. He won 
his 20th straight singles match, defeating Eric Amend, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5). He 
and Brian Garrow then remained unbeaten in 16 dual doubles matches with a 6-4, 
6-4 win over Murphy Jenson and Kent Seton. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's women's tennis team (18-3, 6-2), ranked 11th nationally, will play at 
Cal and Stanford. The Bruins will face the Bears on Sunday and the Cardinal on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, UCLA defeated Brigham Young, 6-1, and No. 3 USC, 6-3. Against the 
Trojans, sophomore walk-on Debbie La Franchi won at No. 6 singles and was in on 
a victory at No. 3 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of nine straight matches, the No. 12 Pepperdine women's tennis team 
(16-7 at the start of the week) will defend its WCAC championship in the 
conference tournament, which starts Friday at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Wave Coach Gualberto Escudero said he thinks that No. 13 San Diego should give 
his team "a real battle" for the conference crown. The Waves and the Toreros 
have split two matches. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pepperdine defeated BYU, 6-3. The Waves will play Monday at San 
Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 13 Pepperdine men's tennis team (13-9 as the week began) will play host 
Friday through Sunday for the men's WCAC championships. On Wednesday the Waves 
will entertain No. 2 Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine has won 16 straight conference championships but will be tested this 
year by No. 15 San Diego, which defeated Pepperdine last Sunday, 5-1. The 
Toreros have also defeated Cal and USC. The Waves defeated UC Santa Barbara on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a 7-2 loss at Cuesta College, the Santa Monica College women's 
tennis team will play at Ventura at 2 p.m. today and at Glendale at 2 p.m. 
Tuesday. Against Cuesta, Karen Imber won to remain unbeaten in singles. 
</P>
<P>
The SMC men will play host to Ventura at 1 p.m. today and to Glendale in a WSC 
finale at 1 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team (26-4 overall and 16-2 in the Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. at the start of the week) will end its 
conference season when it plays host to No. 4 USC (27-9, 12-6) at 7:30 p.m. 
Friday at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins defeated No. 2 Stanford on the road in four games. Matt 
Whitaker led the Bruins with 24 kills, and All-American teammate Trevor 
Schirman added 22. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 7 Pepperdine men's volleyball team (16-13 overall, 8-11 in the WIVA) 
will finish its season by playing host to No. 2 Stanford at 7:30 p.m. Saturday 
at Firestone Fieldhouse. Last week the Waves lost to USC in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College's men's volleyball team will play at El Camino at 7 p.m.

</P>
<P>
The women lost in the nationals to Georgia by 192.65 to 192.6. UCLA's Kim 
Hamilton won her third straight floor exercise title with a 9.9 and captured 
the vault with a 9.75. Teammate Jill Andrews won the beam at 9.8 and was second 
in the vault at 9.725. Tanya Service was second in the all-around competition

most valuable player. Other awards went to senior center Casey Crawford, best 
on defense; freshman forward Geoff Lear, most improved, and junior guard Shann 
Ferch, most inspirational and scholar-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson missed all of the 1986-87 season with a back injury and about half of 
the 1987-88 season with a knee injury. But he came back last season to lead the 
Waves to a 20-13 overall record and to a 1-1 mark in the National Invitation 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's crew will play host for the annual Miller Cup competition 
starting at 8 a.m. Saturday and ending with the finals at 1:30 p.m. at Ballona 
Creek. The Bruin men will row against USC Saturday at San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Zedlitz of the UCLA women's golf team finished second last week at the 
Arizona State Invitational, and the Bruins placed fifth in team competition. 
Zedlitz shot a 222.

FILLMORE SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS 'CUSTOM CALENDAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fillmore school board this week voted unanimously for a controversial 
"custom calendar" plan that could shorten summer vacations by half and give 
kindergarten through 12th-grade students longer winter and spring breaks. 
</P>
<P>
When the change was approved by a board committee last month, more than 550 
students marched through Fillmore's downtown area to the school district office 
in protest. The district responded by suspending the students from school for 1 
1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
However, at Wednesday's meeting, only one couple objected to the plan, and 
there were no student complaints, according to board Chairman Henry Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year trial period for the six schools in the district will begin at the 
start of the 1990-91 school year. However, it has not been decided when school 
will begin and where breaks will be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The district's 400-student Piru Elementary School began operating on the custom 
calender three years ago and found it successful, district officials said. 
Piru's school year ends in June and opens the first week of August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Educationally Better' 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers at Piru felt it would be educationally better for the students to 
have a shorter summer. After a long summer break, they must go through a heavy 
review period. The teachers, staff, students and parents are very happy with 
the custom calender," said Bob Kernan, Fillmore Unified School District 
assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Edmunds, chairman of the committee that made the custom calendar 
recommendation to the school board, said the board discussed a recommendation 
about giving the students a week off in August, three or four weeks after 
school might start, because of the Ventura County Fair. "So many of the 
students out here are involved in it. Now, because we have a custom calendar, 
we can do things like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both teachers and high school students expressed fears during hearings that the 
change might jeopardize their chances at summer jobs. Single parents have said 
the new schedule could foul up court-ordered custody arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
However, Edmunds, who is principal of Piru Elementary School, said the school 
board's controversial vote was a "focus on student needs."

</P>
<P>
The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees, said 13 
Palestinians, six of them younger than 15, were shot to death by Israeli troops 
in the last week. "We deplore this loss of life and call for a halt to the use 
of lethal firepower against civilians, young and old," the agency said in a 
statement issued in Vienna and distributed in Jerusalem.

10 ARRESTED IN BIGGEST-EVER BUST OF BOILER-ROOM INVESTMENT SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Securities agencies from seven states have raided a dozen California 
boiler-room investment operations over the past 10 days, authorities said 
today, seizing evidence and arresting 10 suspects so far in the biggest 
multi-state telemarketing crackdown in history. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the boiler rooms were based in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
although others were located as far north as Sacramento County and as far south 
as San Diego. The firms are suspected of fleecing an estimated 10,000 victims 
in 50 states out of more than $50 million by soliciting investments in bogus 
precious metals and oil and gas schemes, said G. W. McDonald, chief of 
enforcement for the California Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested face felony charges of grand theft, securities fraud, 
commodities fraud, unlicensed activity and violations of the California 
telemarketing registration law, McDonald said at a press conference this 
morning in Los Angeles. The victims lost "nest eggs" ranging from as little as 
$1,000 to as much as $600,000 each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The raids were coordinated under a recently expanded federal program called the 
Leviticus Project, named after the third book of the Bible, which states in 
part: "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor." The project gives grants and 
interstate cooperation to boiler-room bashers in 20 states. California joined 
the project last September.

The Democratic leader of the state Senate today postponed a vote on his bill to 
restrict military-style assault weapons at the request of Gov. George 
Deukmejian, who said he wanted to review the measure before it was sent to his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter this morning to Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles), the Republican governor said he had expected to consider suggesting 
amendments to Roberti's bill after it went to a two-house conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been my intention to offer my observations and any suggested amendments 
at that time. I was informed yesterday, late in the afternoon, that you intend 
to bring up the bill for a final vote on the Senate floor today," Deukmejian 
said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No New Vote Date Set 
</P>
<P>
"I have not had an adequate opportunity to review what you intend to be the 
complete version of SB292. Therefore, I request that you not bring your bill up 
on the Senate floor for a final vote today so that I may review its provisions 
and suggest amendments where appropriate," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said he had agreed to Deukmejian's request for a delay. No new date was 
set for a vote on Roberti's bill, but Capitol sources said as a practical 
matter it could not come up again until early May because of a scheduled trip 
by several key state lawmakers to Washington next week. 
</P>
<P>
At a Capitol news conference, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said 
Deukmejian's request was "unique and a little bit incredible." Deukmejian and 
his staff "have had ample opportunity to participate in the development of this 
bill," Van de Kamp added. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic attorney general said he was concerned that this bill be voted 
on quickly because the opposition, including the National Rifle Assn., "will 
use whatever delay there is to put pressure" on the governor and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Input Urged 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of Californians who support this measure" should 
make the governor aware that they want the bill passed, Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Senate approved a nearly identical Assembly version of 
the assault weapons bill, AB347 by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). The 
26-11 vote moved the bill into a position where it could be used either as a 
backup to the bill introduced by Roberti or as a vehicle for technical 
follow-up amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote on Roos' bill, Roberti said: "We live with restraints. . . . 
You can't own a bazooka. You can't own a ground-to-air missile, and we have to 
put restrictions on assault weapons, too." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. John Doolittle, a Roseville Republican, argued: "We're not talking 
about tanks. We're not talking about bazookas. We're talking about 
semiautomatic weapons which cannot be distinguished from (sporting weapons)." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to create a huge class of lawbreakers out of decent, (law-) 
abiding citizens," Doolittle said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti's nearly identical bill would restrict sales and possession of more 
than 50 models of assault firearms, including the type of AK-47 used to kill 
five Stockton students and wound 29 students and a teacher in January.

The Environmental Protection Agency urged school officials today to test all 
school buildings for radon, saying preliminary tests from 16 states show many 
schools have unhealthy levels of the cancer-causing gas. 
</P>
<P>
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said that although the test results are 
only preliminary, the levels found are high enough to warrant nationwide 
testing of school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that school administrators nationwide understand both the 
seriousness of the risk and the relative simplicity of testing and fixing the 
problem," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states, it appears that 
elevated levels of radon gas can be found in schools throughout the United 
States," Reilly said. He called indoor radon "one of the major environmental 
health threats facing Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally by the decay 
of radium-226 in soil and rocks.

Former U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright was honored today with the Athinai prize, 
the main award among the annual Onassis prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Fulbright, 84, was cited for establishing this century's largest international 
fellowship program of academic and cultural exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"In the words of your tutor at Oxford, you are 'responsible for the largest and 
most significant movement of scholars across the face of the Earth since the 
fall of Constantinople in 1453,' " John Brademas, president of New York 
University, told the Arkansas Democrat as ministers, diplomats and local 
dignitaries looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Fulbright said he hoped the exchange program he founded more than 40 years ago 
could play a role in "enhancing mutual understanding" among countries. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Andreas Papandreou gave out the awards, totaling $400,000, at a 
ceremony in a packed chamber of the former Parliament building.

President Bush signed an executive order today re-establishing the National 
Space Council headed by Vice President Dan Quayle to oversee America's future 
in space and pledged to "continue on the path we blazed in earlier decades." 
</P>
<P>
The council will develop a long-range strategy for space exploration and 
"foster close cooperation" between civil, military and commercial space efforts 
-- including the space station Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, we take your charge with a great deal of seriousness," Quayle 
said at a signing ceremony in his office. 
</P>
<P>
The space panel was first created by President John F. Kennedy in the early 
days of space travel and disbanded in 1973 by President Richard M. Nixon as 
popular and political support waned after the Apollo moon landings.

General Motors Corp., the nation's largest company, today said its 
first-quarter earnings jumped more than 40%, to $1.55 billion from $1.09 
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The auto giant said earnings per share rose to $2.37 from $1.56 last year, near 
the top of the range of estimates made by analysts recently. 
</P>
<P>
But sales rose more modestly than earnings, advancing about 12% to $29.60 
billion from $26.44 billion. 
</P>
<P>
While the industry has suffered from generally slumping demand in the quarter, 
GM boosted car sales by offering incentives including rebates and cut-rate 
financing. It also continued a program of massive cost cuts that kept profit 
rising despite sluggish sales.

Eggs may not all be egg-shaped anymore if a French firm's marketing plan 
succeeds in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that might leave even chickens scratching their heads, the firm hopes 
to sell "square eggs" in gourmet shops across the nation soon. 
</P>
<P>
The square eggs are really fully cooked, reconstituted hard egg cubes, 
two-thirds of an inch square, currently being marketed by the firm Ov'Action 
Inc., of Lieven, France. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage is that they can be cooked in a microwave oven, unlike the 
from-the-hen variety whose shells can create a messy explosion if they are 
microwaved. 
</P>
<P>
The squares are not available in the United States yet, but federal approval 
for a private tasting of the square egg has already been received. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave-cooked, pasteurized and/or homogenized egg cubes contain three 
layers of egg -- white on top and bottom and yellow in between. It has a 21-day 
shelf life when stored at cool temperatures and sells for around $2 for a 
24-pack in some French food stores. 
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to make an excellent salad garnishing or be used in making 
canapes for parties and can be served as a substitute for most types of cooked 
eggs.

The vote was 77 to 47 to join the Graphic Communications International Union.

The election pitted the 150,000-member union against the $3.3-billion Gannett

Unions represent about 20% of the 37,000 Gannett Co. workers.

Giving the women champions equal time in a sunny Rose Garden ceremony with his

FOOTBALL ASSN. PROPOSES 16-TEAM PLAYOFF

The College Football Assn. has presented a plan to bowl representatives for a 
16-team national championship playoff in the early 1990s that could bring 
participating schools millions of dollars but undermine the present bowl 
system, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said CFA Executive Director Chuck Neinas 
revealed the plan at a closed meeting with eight bowl representatives in 
Atlanta Wednesday. Attending the meeting were officials from the Orange, Sugar, 
Cotton, Holiday, Citrus, Fiesta, Liberty and Peach bowls, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA is a group of 63 schools that play Division I football, including teams 
from the Southeastern, Atlantic Coast, Southwest and Big Eight conferences, 
plus leading independents such as Notre Dame, Penn State and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff would exclude the Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences which have 
their own television package, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowl sources said the CFA has been seriously studying a playoff system for the 
past four months and considered more than 40 plans before deciding on the one 
revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Journal-Constitution, the plan calls for a selection committee 
similar to the one that picks the field for the NCAA basketball tournament. The 
committee would pick and seed the 16 teams for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The top eight seeds would host first-round games on the campuses. The four 
quarterfinal, two semifinal and championship games would be held at current 
bowl sites yet to be determined and would essentially take the place of those 
bowls. The championship game, which may be rotated among several bowl sites, 
would be held on the weekend before the NFL's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA will take the plan to its membership at its annual convention June 2-4 
in Dallas. If it passes there, the CFA will try to get it on the ballot for the 
NCAA convention in January.

UCLA'S AIKMAN SIGNS WITH COWBOYS; 
</P>
<P>
AGENT SAYS QUARTERBACK WILL BECOME HIGHEST-PAID ROOKIE IN NFL HISTORY

<P>
UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman signed today with the Dallas Cowboys, a deal his 
agent has maintained will make Aikman the highest-paid rookie in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys, who own the No. 1 pick in Sunday's NFL draft and will use it to 
select Aikman, ended weeks of speculation and trade rumors with the 
announcement at their Valley Ranch headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have felt for quite some time -- at least as long as I've been a Cowboy as 
a matter of fact -- that Troy Aikman is the No. 1 football player today in the 
United States coming out of college," Cowboys owner and President Jerry Jones 
said in making the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, 
has maintained that it will surpass the 6-year, $8.2-million deal quarterback 
Vinny Testaverde signed with Tampa Bay as the No. 1 pick in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime a first overall pick comes through as a quarterback, it will be a 
breakthrough deal," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"I made no secrets about the fact that I would love to play for the Dallas 
Cowboys as early as last year," Aikman said. "I think it's one of the premier 
organizations in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "There were a lot of rumors 
going around about trades or them taking someone else, and I said I could be 
happy playing anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the back of my mind, all along, I knew I wanted to play in Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson praised Steinberg and Mike McCoy, who represented 
the Cowboys in negotiations, for the speed with which the deal was consummated. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys have the No. 1 pick in the draft by virtue of their NFL-worst 3-13 
record last season. 
</P>
<P>
NFL scouts tout Aikman's good size (6-2 1/2, 218 pounds), mobility and a quick 
release that makes him difficult to sack. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman has a strong arm but also displays a nice touch on his short- and 
intermediate-range passes. He scored a 29 out of 50 on the Wonderlic 
intelligence exam given at the Indianapolis combine, which is considered above 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman transferred to UCLA in 1986 after breaking his leg as a sophomore 
starter at Oklahoma. As a two-year starter at UCLA, he passed for 5,298 yards 
and 42 touchdowns, completing 65% of his passes. The Bruins were 20-4 in 
Aikman's two years.
