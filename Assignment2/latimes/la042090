LANDFILL SENTRY MATCHES WITS WITH BIRDS TO PROTECT AIRCRAFT AND LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When the stench of garbage begins to rise over the 420-acre Miramar Sanitary 
Landfill, Mike Rennie loads his shotgun with an Explosive Pest Repellent 
Device, looks into the sun and waits. 
</P>
<P>
The birds will be here soon, the 19-year-old city laborer says. "They always 
come back." And Rennie is ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with loud but harmless flying projectiles, Rennie is one of a dozen city 
employees trained in the art of scaring scavengers -- the gulls and blackbirds 
that look upon the landfill as their next meal. Seven days a week, 12 hours a 
day, one of these men can be found atop a mountain of trash, squinting for a 
glimpse of a gull. Every few minutes, a Navy jet flies overhead -- each one a 
$33.5-million reminder of why Rennie and his colleagues do what they do. 
</P>
<P>
"If the sea gulls get sucked up in there," he explained Thursday as an F-14 jet 
fighter from the neighboring Miramar Naval Air Station roared by, "then I get 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
On average, laborers like Rennie make $28,000 a year, including benefits, 
according to Michael Bresnahan, the landfill operations manager. But he says 
funding the city's bird-control program is a small price to pay for the use of 
the landfill site, which is owned by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has granted the city an easement to pile trash, free of charge, as 
high as the jet station's runways. In return, the Navy dumps its trash in the 
landfill free. There's only one catch -- the city must prevent "bird strikes." 
</P>
<P>
"Birds and aviation are a difficult mixture," said Chief Petty Officer Bobbie 
Carleton, a Navy spokeswoman, noting that, although no bird-related accidents 
have occurred in San Diego, jets have been known to crash elsewhere after 
sucking birds into their engines. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst case is jet-threatening and life-threatening as well," Carleton 
said. "It's also possible for what we call a 'bird strike' to go through the 
canopies (the glass over the cockpit), disabling the pilot." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is concerned enough about such airborne obstacles that it has come up 
with an acronym for them: BASH, or Bird Aircraft Strike Hazards. According to 
Carleton, the Navy uses its BASH program to teach aviators life-saving 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"Like when you're flying around, and you meet a duck, you fly up because the 
duck will fly down -- duck psychology," Carleton said. "I wouldn't say that 
it's a real exact science. If it was, we wouldn't need these guys out there 
seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, says Hank L. Rodriguez, the senior disposal site supervisor at 
the landfill, a little bird psychology goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts to repel birds have included purchasing plastic owls and playing 
amplified recordings of birds in distress. Once, he ran a crisscross of wires 
across the mouth of a landfill pit to disrupt birds' flight patterns. But the 
cornerstone of his bird control program is an arsenal of noise-making 
cartridges, three types of "racket bombs" that his men fire at the rate of up 
to 300 a day. 
</P>
<P>
With 4,400 tons of fresh, pungent trash arriving at the landfill each day, the 
birds have plenty of incentive to persevere. So city workers are strategic in 
their firecracker deployment. After observing that birds soon learn to 
recognize which vehicle carries the man with the shotgun, Rodriguez has advised 
his bird control men to switch cars every so often. And he advises his men not 
to fire at regular intervals -- "you have to be sporadic." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything works to a certain extent, but nothing works 100%," he said. 
"You've got to combine things to keep them disoriented." 
</P>
<P>
After a year on the job, Rennie has discovered that, if he fires too many 
"whistlers" in a row, the birds get used to it. The trick is to keep them 
guessing: a whistler, followed by the boom of a racket bomb, followed by the 
dreaded combo -- a whistler that wiggles with a disconcertingly erratic motion. 
</P>
<P>
He has also learned to watch for "scouts" -- the lone birds that blaze the 
trail for the entire flock. If you let one land, the rest will follow, a moving 
wall of feathers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them will casually come over, and I'll fire," Rennie said. "When they 
finally realize I'm not going to let them land, they head elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
But, with one man covering more than 400 acres, the birds have the advantage. 
They circle back, luring the human and his truck to another site, only to 
return to their original target. 
</P>
<P>
"In due time they figure me out," Rennie concedes. "Makes you wonder what's 
going on in that little head of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to chase them at times. They'll play games," Rodriguez said. "You 
have to keep alternating your methods." 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to outthink them," said landfill manager Bresnahan. "The humbling 
part is when they outthink you." 
</P>
<P>
Rennie, who also does other tasks at the dump, says that when he first realized 
what part of the tasks entailed, he was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'We're going to hire you to shoot a shotgun.' I said, 'Right on! 
Sounds great,' " he said, adding that his friends "don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "It's not a break. It's a job. You've got to do it. You can't 
just take a nap in the truck."

SDSU FOUNDATION SUES OVER U.S. AUDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego State University Foundation filed suit in U. S. District Court on 
Thursday, accusing the Department of Commerce of unlawfully withholding grant 
money while audits concerning a disputed school program remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the foundation said at a press conference that the group's 
fund-raising ability may be jeopardized if it cannot continue to obtain grant 
money while the three audits, the first of which began in 1983, are pending. 
</P>
<P>
James Feldesman, the group's Washington-based attorney, said the Commerce 
Department is withholding from the foundation five grant awards valued at a 
total of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the department wants the foundation to repay 
$405,406 that the first two audits identified as being allegedly misused. A 
third, preliminary audit seeks to recover an additional $1.6 million from the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Feldesman described the demands by the Commerce Department as having a 
crippling effect on the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a federal agency come down on an institution the way the 
Department of Commerce is coming down on the San Diego State Foundation," he 
said. "I don't know what possessed them to drop the hydrogen bomb on the 
foundation." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department, reached Thursday night at his office in 
Washington, said he lacked enough information to comment on the audits or the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a multimillion-dollar program operated by the foundation to 
increase minority involvement in the Los Angeles-area economy. One of the 
audits alleges that managers of the program engaged in fraud and mismanagement 
in trying to exaggerate the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
The program is the nation's largest recipient of federal money from the 
Minority Business Development Agency, a branch of the Commerce Department. The 
SDSU foundation manages similar programs in San Diego and Tucson, but 
foundation officials said those programs are not in question. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of its lucrative grant contracts with the agency, the foundation is 
supposed to help minority business owners obtain loans, bonds and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the most recent audit, the foundation uses phone canvassing, 
high-pressure sales pitches and bank contacts to create the impression that it 
has assisted minority-owned oil companies, real estate firms, bridal shops, 
liquor stores and hundreds of other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Frea Sladek, associate general manager for the nonprofit foundation, called the 
charges "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "now is not the time to respond to specific allegations. There 
will be a time for that. After all, that's what we want, that's what we're 
asking for." 
</P>
<P>
Feldesman said the Commerce Department has denied the foundation a fair 
administrative hearing in defending itself against the charges, which he said 
will be dismissed once an impartial arbiter listens to the case. He said the 
foundation has pursued the matter through channels within the department, to no 
avail. 
</P>
<P>
"We were forced to turn to the courts," he said Thursday. "No appropriate 
hearing has ever been conducted on any of these matters." 
</P>
<P>
"To add insult to injury," he said, "we've been denied access to all of their 
papers. Once it comes to a fair hearing, we're fully confident of winning. We'd 
be fools to have the court give us what we want (a hearing) if we weren't 
convinced we'd prevail. We're simply asking for due process and a fair 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation hopes that the suit is heard before April 30 so that money will 
no longer be withheld, pending the outcome of a later hearing before an 
impartial arbiter. 
</P>
<P>
Feldesman said that, if a judge cannot hear the matter before then, the 
foundation may have to close its minority training centers in San Diego and 
Tucson, now being operated at its own expense. He assessed the cost at about 
$30,000 a month and added that the Los Angeles center was closed last month 
pending the outcome of charges against it. 
</P>
<P>
Feldesman said it is "unlawful and illegal" for the Commerce Department to 
withhold a total of five academic grant awards, two of which do not relate to 
the program in question. The two unrelated to the program are National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration grants, which the department suspended in the 
wake of the controversy, Feldesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have nothing to do with this dispute whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldesman also branded as unlawful a decision by the department's inspector 
general to levy against the foundation a debt of $405,406 as a result of the 
first two audits of the Los Angeles center. 
</P>
<P>
"That's money they're saying we have to pay back, not to mention the monies 
they're withholding," Feldesman said. "Now the big thing is the third audit, 
which involves about $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Add all of that up -- $100,000 or so in the first audit, $305,000 in the 
second and $1.6 million in the third -- and you're talking a potential 
$2-million debt. That could cripple the university."

Rose Bowl officials have rejected Jim Purol's request for a one-day ticket to 
sit in all 104,091 seats of the stadium for charity. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not discouraged. Next he's going to ask the Coliseum, which may have a 
lot of spare time -- and empty seats -- on its hands. 
</P>
<P>
Purol, 38, wants to break the record he set/sat at Michigan Stadium, where he 
sank into all 101,701 seats and raised several thousand dollars in the process. 
</P>
<P>
A member of Pasadena's governing Board of Directors called his request 
"stupid." (Plus, the august arena is busy, since it will soon be hosting a flea 
market and off-road vehicle races.) 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for Purol, his talents aren't limited to sitting. He's also puffed on 
152 cigarettes at once ("to show the stupid side of smoking"), stuffed an 
entire large pizza in his mouth ("everything on it but anchovies"), and played 
the drums in an underwater band. 
</P>
<P>
If no stadium welcomes him, he has other mountains to scale. 
</P>
<P>
"I might drive from New York to L.A. in reverse gear," he said. "The world 
record's 30 days. I think I could make it in three weeks."

The L.A. Library Assn. is holding one of its biggest events of the year 
Thursday night and among the notables who aren't expected to be seen are 
Century City businessman Ronald Reagan, authors Ray Bradbury and Joseph 
Wambaugh and director Oliver Stone. 
</P>
<P>
There's a reason. It's the third annual Stay Home and Read a Book Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons are asked to save the money they would have spent on buying a ticket to 
a fancy dinner, renting a tuxedo, etc., and instead donate it to LALA, a 
support group for the L.A. Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who praised last year's Stay Home Ball was author Norman Cousins, 
who marveled: "I don't remember when I've been to a better event." 
</P>
<P>
Lest we should be accused of editing the witty Robert Benchley, Thursday's 
column should have said that when he fell into a pool at the old Garden of 
Allah hotel, he uttered: "Get me out of these wet clothes and into a dry 
martini." 
</P>
<P>
It's been transformed into a pumpkin at Thanksgiving time. When the Dodgers won 
the World Series (remember back that far?), it became a baseball. Now, the 
storage tank at the Unocal refinery in Wilmington has been dressed up to 
resemble the world globe in honor of Earth Day.

all-day rate.

<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A TORRANCE DEVELOPER WANTS TO CONVERT THE ASCOT PARK AUTO RACE 
TRACK TO A MASSIVE RETAIL CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Torrance developer plans to convert the Ascot Park speedway in Harbor Gateway 
into a retail complex, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores 
disclosed Thursday in a speech to the Harbor City/Harbor Gateway Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In a decidedly upbeat "state of the city" address, Flores also lauded the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division for its innovative anti-gang 
efforts and said she supports establishing separate postal ZIP codes to help 
create an identity for the two Los Angeles communities. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Mann of Torrance-based Andrex Development Co. confirmed that he is close 
to signing a 99-year lease on the Vermont Avenue property, which has been an 
auto race track since 1957. He said preliminary plans for a proposed commercial 
center are in the hands of city building officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about 500,000 or 550,000 square feet of retail space," Mann 
said. "Large-volume retail discount centers are the kinds of tenants that would 
be appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Mann has developed several business and office complexes around the South Bay 
in recent years, including the 50-acre Andrex Point business park at the 
intersection of the Harbor and San Diego freeways not far from the raceway. 
Last fall, he bucked convention when he opened the upscale Paradise restaurant 
in that complex. 
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Flores called Mann's proposed development a "dynamic change" and 
said: "The center will allow both residents and business workers of the gateway 
to shop in their own neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Lillian Ziegler, owners of the 36-acre Ascot property just south of 
Artesia Boulevard, said Thursday that Mann has an option until June 30 to sign 
a lease. The current lease, held by Agajanian Enterprises Inc. of Gardena, 
which operates the Ascot Park speedway, expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Foote, the Agajanian executive vice president who runs the speedway, said 
Ascot officials have long known that 1990 would be the last season of racing at 
the park, but Flores' remarks Thursday were the first public acknowledgement of 
specific development plans for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said the proposed commercial center would feature two or three 
large-volume discount stores, such as Home Depot or Cost Plus, and many smaller 
retail operations and restaurants. The complex would not be an enclosed mall, 
Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got plenty of office space and development in the area, and the 
natural extension is to now supply that business that serves the residential 
areas," Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
City building and safety officials are looking at preliminary plans for the 
project, including landscaping and architectural specifications, Mann said. 
Although more than half of the property where the raceway sits is former 
landfill, environmental reviews of the site indicate the proposed development 
would be ecologically and seismically safe, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a clean site with no toxics," he said. "We will build with pilings 
through the landfill into an excellent layer of clay" to meet earthquake safety 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said he hopes to begin work on the project as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
In other remarks to the chamber, Flores praised a Harbor Division police 
program designed to curb gang-related crime. Police say the Gang Abatement 
Program, the second of its kind in the nation, reduced Harbor area gang-related 
crime by almost 50% between 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-part program, Harbor Division detectives have created profiles of 
known violent street gangs and also have worked with prosecutors to enforce a 
1989 state law allowing stiffer penalties for gang-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, an additional three 
years can be attached to sentences of felons convicted of gang-related crimes, 
and one year can be added to misdemeanor sentences for gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"We started this last year, and in 1989, the Harbor area was the only area (in 
Los Angeles) that showed major gang reduction. And we are still decreasing," 
said Lt. Mike Markulis. 
</P>
<P>
Flores also touched upon the traditional theme of Harbor Gateway's identity 
complex. Annexed by Los Angeles to connect the city to the lucrative Port of 
Los Angeles, the long, narrow community was for years tagged the "shoestring 
strip" or the "city strip." Residents have complained that Los Angeles police 
stations are too far to the north and south of the strip to be effective in 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she supports a bill by U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) that 
would allow communities to request postal ZIP codes based on community 
boundaries, instead of forcing them to accept different numbers that slice 
across a small area. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be very helpful to the Gateway as well as other communities" trying 
to establish an identity, Flores said.

WEEKENDER: A WORLD OF ACTIVITIES SET FOR EARTH DAY.

Some people will bicycle along the beach, some will ride the waves on 
surfboards. Others will listen to environmental speakers or sweat a little 
planting trees and picking up trash. 
</P>
<P>
But however they do it, all will be observing the global Earth Day 1990 today 
through Sunday . 
</P>
<P>
Some organizers say that this Earth Day may be more critical than the original 
one 20 years ago because environmental problems -- from global warming to 
vanishing rain forests -- have worsened. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a deep concern for the environment, and it's not going to go away," 
said Barbara Epstein, co-chair of the largest observance in the area -- a free 
family festival that 18 organizations are sponsoring Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. at Palos Verdes High School, 600 Cloyden Road, Palos Verdes Estates.

WEEKEND SHOWERS ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More showers are on the way for the weekend, packing enough rain to give lawns 
and gardens a decent watering but not much more, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two storms from the Pacific Northwest should drop 0.25 of an inch of rain or 
less in the county, as well as a small amount in the desert, beginning 
Saturday, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"April showers may bring Borrego flowers," Shigehara said. "It doesn't look 
like it will be much rain. If you have flowers, this rain will be good because 
it's free, and plants love rainwater. It will be good rain to wet your petunias 
and lawns." 
</P>
<P>
A 20% to 30% chance of periodic showers is expected this weekend, along with 
plenty of clouds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be raining constantly," he said. "Rain here and there, now and then." 
</P>
<P>
Showers brought about 0.37 of an inch of rain to San Diego this week, and 1.5 
inches to the mountains. Nearly 0.69 of an inch has fallen this month, bringing 
the season total to 6.39 inches. This puts the season ahead of 1989's total 
rainfall to date, but lags far behind the normal average of 8.82. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures will probably remain constant through the weekend, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime beach temperatures will range from 62 to 66 today through Sunday. 
Coastal and inland areas will have highs of 65 to 70 degrees, dropping to 52 to 
58 on the coast and 47 to 54 inland. 
</P>
<P>
Highs of 47 to 57 are expected in the mountain areas, with overnight lows of 35 
to 45 degrees. Daytime desert temperatures should be in the 80s, falling to the 
50s at night. 
</P>
<P>
Surf is 3 feet at 13-second intervals, and the ocean temperature is 64 degrees.

S&amp;L CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
The solution to the savings and loan junk bond crisis is not that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Just make possible a marketplace reversal. 
</P>
<P>
The government should set a five- to seven-year window during which period 
dividends would be deductible to corporations. Corporations would then be in a 
position to exchange debt for equity and permit stockholders a return on their 
investment without requiring them to sell their stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
If capital gains taxes were reinstated, the process of economic health would be 
accelerated. Corporate performance would once again be evaluated on 
profitability and not on takeover speculation.

LINCOLN BLVD. DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed overdevelopment along Lincoln Boulevard reminds me of an 
overweight aunt (overdeveloped Southern California ) who smokes (air pollution) 
and has clogged arteries (the traffic mess) with a very large life insurance 
policy (the financial benefits from the overdevelopment) whose policy's 
beneficiaries are her nephews and nieces (local governments and developers). 
</P>
<P>
In order to collect the policy's death benefit the nephews and nieces overfeed 
the aunt, sweet-talk her, and encourage her to continue to smoke to hasten her 
demise; and, thus, collect their money without regard for their aunt's health. 
</P>
<P>
What the aunt really needs is to quit smoking, exercise (including her rights 
to self-determination) and take the fat out of her diet. But the nephews and 
nieces in their greed talk the aunt into keeping her bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those of us who know and love the aunt, but are not her policy's 
beneficiaries, suffer from the abuse done to her and are stuck paying her 
estate's cost.

PROFIT RIGHTS FOR PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the article about John Moore ("Case Argues Rights Over Tissue 
Used in Research," Part A, April 11) appealing to the state Supreme Court after 
his cancerous spleen was removed which saved his life, to grant medical 
patients the right to share in profits from the commercial use of their tissue, 
I decided that if he wins, he is setting a weird precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Picture this: When people have surgery, they tell their doctor that any organ 
removed from their body belongs to them and that they are to be kept informed 
as to what is done with it. 
</P>
<P>
So the scientific community discovers, as in Moore's case, that the diseased 
organ has valuable properties that would greatly aid humankind. What happens 
next? Do the doctors and medical research center implement their medical 
findings or do they first figure out the monetary value of the patient's organ? 
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, I have elected to donate my organs upon my death. Perhaps I 
should qualify this by stating that if they find anything of value to notify my 
heirs.

LINCOLN BLVD. DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times article on effects from planned development on or near Lincoln 
Boulevard (Part A, April 4) describes a traffic gridlock catastrophe in the 
making. Planning experts quoted in the article, and your editorial (April 8), 
call for the formation of regional planning agencies as a solution to limit 
uncontrolled development. 
</P>
<P>
I believe regional planning will be ineffective without crucially needed 
accountability at the local level to prohibit irresponsible decision making on 
development. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Culver City's Marina Place proposal, all of the runaway 
offending large projects mentioned in the article, and most of the smaller 
ones, are directly under the control of Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Galanter is 
a proponent of piecemeal, project-by-project deals with developers, an approach 
that ignores the cumulative effect of development on the quality of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
For several years Venice residents have asked Galanter not to approve 
development that exceeds the capacity of our community. The Venice Town 
Council, a grass-roots community organization, gathered petitions asking 
Galanter to sponsor an objective study to set capacity limits. Galanter 
rejected these requests.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EL SEGUNDO AWARDS CONTRACT ON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The El Segundo City Council on Tuesday awarded a $3-million contract for work 
that will more than double the size of the public library at 111 W. Mariposa 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The work, by P. W. Construction Inc., includes renovation of the existing 
13,600-square-foot library, construction of a 15,600-square-foot addition and 
landscaping of the library grounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials, the project will expand the size of the reference area, 
the children's library and the library book stacks. A community meeting room 
will also be provided. 
</P>
<P>
Work is to begin in June and will take 18 months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for expanding the library date back to 1983, when a study concluded that 
the existing facility was overcrowded.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a small-business person in Marina del Rey, I would like to ask these 
developers one question: Who in their right mind, with the necessary money to 
spend, will stay (or for retailers, go to shop) in such an overcrowded, 
gridlocked area? Everything that now makes the marina a nice place to be, will 
be destroyed and business will therefore go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Marina Place Mall in particular, for those in Culver City who think 
it will enhance their city's image, think again. The developer plans to call it 
Marina Place. Even General Telephone will probably say it's in Venice.

THE LIMITS OF PROTECTION; 
</P>
<P>
 SURE, SUPPRESS KID PORN, BUT BE CAREFUL HOW YOU DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing states to outlaw or stiffen penalties 
for the private possession of pornographic photographs of children is a 
necessary step, though the lawmakers, who now will move to implement it, would 
do well to heed the reservations of the three justices who dissented from 
Wednesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
At root, the court held, the issue created by such pornography is one of child 
protection and only peripherally one of expression. In fact, writing for the 
six jurists who voted in Osborne vs. Ohio to uphold Ohio's statute banning 
possession of child porn, Justice Byron R. White took care to say that the 
court did not intend to diminish the constitutional protection it extended to 
the private possession of obscene material in the 1969 case of Stanley vs. 
Georgia. In that instance, White noted, the state incorrectly "sought to 
proscribe the private possession of obscenity because it was concerned that 
obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers." That "paternalistic" 
approach, he said, infringed on First Amendment freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio law, on the other hand, sought to "protect the victims of child 
pornography" by "destroy(ing) a market for the exploitative use of children." 
To that end, it was "reasonable for the state to conclude that it will decrease 
the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view 
the product, thereby decreasing demand." 
</P>
<P>
In his minority opinion, however, Justice William J. Brennan reminded his 
colleagues that laws governing even so offensive an expression as child 
pornography inevitably involve some balance between "the First Amendment and 
the state's interests" -- in this case protection of children's health and 
welfare. As originally drafted, Brennan pointed out, Ohio's statute was 
dangerously broad. Had its scope not been narrowed by Ohio's own Supreme Court, 
the law, Brennan wrote, would have permitted prosecution of individuals who 
have pictures of "teen-agers in revealing dresses" or "even of toddlers romping 
unclothed." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of sloppy and potentially dangerous ambiguity is precisely what the 
California Legislature ought to avoid as it moves to make possession of child 
pornography a felony rather than a misdemeanor, as it is now. It also ought to 
avoid any flirtation with the so-called "strict liability" provisions that have 
opened some federal laws to challenge because they allow prosecution of people 
who unknowingly possess such material. 
</P>
<P>
The state's interest here is in rooting out a despicable vice, not in the 
proscription of speech, however noxious.

ENVIRONMENT GETTING ON BOARD;

<P>
MANY HUES BLEND WITH GREEN; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES, WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE NEAR LANDFILLS AND TOXIC-WASTE DUMPS, 
ARE TURNING TO ECOLOGY IN INCREASING NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLARENCE PAGE, Clarence Page is a syndicated columnist in Chicago. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earth Week is a good time to ponder the ultimate socioeconomic irony of the 
ecology movement: Those who care the most about pollution also tend to be those 
who can most afford to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
We tend to identify Earth Day and the rest of the environmental movement with 
the young, white, middle-class backpackers, whale lovers and "tree huggers," 
who seem to make up the bulk of the leadership and staff in ecological 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the poor and struggling blue-collar working-class folks who tend to 
eat, drink and raise their children in closest proximity to lead, asbestos, 
toxic-waste dumps, landfills, polluting factories and polluted water runoffs. 
Times Beach was not Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet minorities tend to be identified with social-justice issues more than they 
are identified with ecology. The pressing short-term problems of poverty, 
unemployment, illiteracy, infant mortality and drug-related violence tend to 
squeeze out long-term environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. In growing numbers, minorities are making themselves heard from East 
Harlem to East Los Angeles, giving the "green" movement a new rainbow of hues. 
</P>
<P>
For example, historically black Howard University in Washington was recently 
host to the first National Minority Environmental Career Conference; and the 
New York-based United Church of Christ's Commission on Racial Justice, headed 
by the Rev. Ben Chavis, a noted black civil-rights activist in the 1960s, has a 
"Toxics and Minority Communities Project" that has taken a leading role in 
researching pollution and forming coalitions with established ecology groups. 
</P>
<P>
Among countless other efforts, Greenpeace has been working with other activists 
to try to stop construction of waste-disposal facilities in Chicago's heavily 
black south and southwestern suburbs, and the predominantly Hispanic Mothers of 
East Los Angeles joined white and black activists to stop construction of a 
large incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, never one to allow an activist train to pull out of the 
station without getting himself on board, recently made a national tour with 
Earth Day 1990 Chairman Dennis Hayes to focus attention on minority and 
low-income community environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and other people of color are going "green," and it's about time. 
Evidence of the disproportionately hazardous impact of environmental pollutants 
on minorities is overwhelming. A study by Chavis' project, for example, found 
race to be "the single largest predictor" of who gets a toxic-waste dump in his 
neighborhood; and a General Accounting Office survey in the early 1980s found 
rural blacks in the Southeast most likely to live near the region's waste dumps 
and landfills. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chavis and several other black leaders sent letters to eight major 
environmental groups in January charging them with racism in their hiring and 
with a general failure to address the urgent environmental needs of low-income 
minority communities. Groups with good minority outreach records -- like 
Greenpeace, which has established internships and active recruitment of 
minorities for its board -- were left off their list. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not as simple as that. The environmental movement has an economic 
paradox that hits low-income minority communities particularly hard: Can we 
have a clean environment and strong economic development at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
American Indians in the Southwest have protested a range of industrial 
infringements on their ancient homelands, while environmental groups have been 
trying to persuade the economically embattled leaders of all-black Robbins, 
Chicago's poorest suburb, that the few jobs that would be generated by a 
proposed incinerator are not worth the environmental hazards that would come 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has become divided among the "green greens," who would halt any 
industry that threatens to cause even the slightest disruption of the 
environment; the "red greens," who cry out for more government regulation, and 
the "blue greens," who seek ways to get a clean environment and strong 
blue-collar economic development at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Among minority leaders, the "blue greens," or some version of them, appear to 
be winning. Unfortunately, African American and other minority leaders have had 
so many problems in their attempts to develop a firm economic agenda since the 
1960s that they have only begun to figure in an environmental agenda. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the cleanup starts at home. The popular slogan "think globally, 
act locally" has particular significance to minority communities, where the 
greatest hazards are human-made, one way or another. Neighborhood cleanup 
efforts can form the foundation of social and political activism that can 
pressure politicians and build coalitions for a range of other community 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Every rainbow coalition needs a touch of green.

<P>
With Earth Day 1990, the country's commitment to the restoration of our badly 
polluted environment reaches a new peak. 
</P>
<P>
But now, 20 years after the original Earth Day, we also know that the task is 
much more difficult than it seemed in 1970. After a massive effort to clean up 
the environment -- comprehensive environmental laws have been passed, a 
detailed system of regulations has been created and about $1 trillion of public 
and private money has been spent to meet them -- environmental quality has 
hardly improved. In many respects, it is worse. The very few successes -- among 
them, the 94% reduction in lead emissions since 1975 and the concurrent drop in 
lead levels in the blood of children -- signal the need for a new environmental 
strategy. Pollution must be prevented at the point of origin; the production 
process that generates it must be changed to eliminate the pollutant (as we did 
by switching to unleaded gasoline). 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has already acknowledged that the present 
strategy -- which is based on tacking controls on automobile exhausts, smoke 
stacks and effluent pipes -- has failed and has committed itself to "a 
preventive program to reduce or eliminate the generation of potentially harmful 
pollutants." But this is easier said than done, for it involves the replacement 
of the production technologies, largely introduced after World War II, that 
have afflicted us with smog (high-compression automobile engines); with 
pesticide-laden fruit and vegetables and ground water laced with nitrate 
(agriculture heavily based on chemicals); with mounting stores of radioactive 
waste and the threat of another Three Mile Island or Chernobyl (the nuclear 
industry); with global warming, acid rain and a growing number of oil spills 
(the energy industry); with ozone depletion, plastics being littered on beaches 
and festooned on trees, and the hundreds of billions of pounds of toxic 
chemicals emitted annually into the environment (the chemical industry). 
</P>
<P>
How can we begin this formidable task? 
</P>
<P>
Economists will tell us that the replacement of one production technology by 
another represents an investment decision that, in our free-market economy, is 
the efficient response to consumers' demands. In practice, producers choose 
whatever technology promises to maximize profits and are therefore likely to 
resist a change motivated instead by environmental concerns. For example, auto 
manufacturers switched to high-compression engines after World War II because 
they were needed to power the larger cars that yielded a higher rate of return 
than small ones. (As Henry Ford II put it: "Minicars make mini-profits.") 
</P>
<P>
How, then, can individual consumers persuade the auto manufacturers to market a 
smogless car driven by an electric motor or a stratified-charge engine (a 
high-compression gasoline engine that, unlike conventional ones, produces very 
little nitrogen oxides, the substance that triggers the smog reaction)? What 
would persuade the minuscule photovoltaic-cell industry to expand enough to 
reduce the cost of this pollution-free source of solar electricity to the point 
of replacing the present, highly polluting power plants? What would encourage 
farmers to shift to organic agriculture, eliminating the environmentally 
hazardous chemicals they now use? How could we persuade the very few 
manufacturers of recycling and composting facilities to expand so that we can 
actually recover the nearly 90% of the trash stream that is recyclable? 
</P>
<P>
There is, in fact, a readily available, effective -- if little used -- 
instrument that could bring clean, ecologically sound technologies into the 
market: the federal government. The government is the nation's single largest 
consumer. For example, it buys about 5% of U.S. auto production annually. Its 
purchasing power is great enough to persuade producers -- as small as a farmer 
or as large as an auto company -- to shift to clean technologies. In some cases 
(for example, photovoltaic cells), a federal purchase would lead to economies 
of scale that would sharply reduce prices. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental crisis cries out for leadership. Here is a historic 
opportunity for exercising it. If President Bush, a self-anointed 
environmentalist, wants to really earn his new title, let him issue an 
executive order -- Earth Day, this Sunday, is a good day for it -- requiring 
that the vast government purchasing power be directed toward smogless cars and 
trucks, solar energy sources, organic fruits and vegetables, recycled paper and 
all the other products of the clean, sustainable technologies that are our one 
hope for making peace with the planet.

GREAT-GRANDMOTHER IS FLYING HIGH AT 85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Brent Clingman took his grandmother for a ride in an off-track 
race car through the desert on her birthday. He promised her that, if she lived 
to be 85, he would take her on a helicopter ride. She turned 85 Thursday and 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
"For her 75th birthday, I got a male stripper for her and took her for a ride 
in the desert in a race car," he said. "She was a little scared at first, but 
then she told me to go faster. So, I drove about 90 to 95 through the sand and 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Nina Z. Hoke remembers the ride, but she remembers the stripper even better. 
</P>
<P>
"He was great," she said. "He was more embarrassed than I was. He was a cute 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
To lure his grandmother to Corporate Helicopters of San Diego, based at Jimsair 
Aviation Services on Pacific Highway, Clingman told her he was taking her to an 
outdoor restaurant for dinner. However, when they arrived at the airfield, Hoke 
still did not think anything was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my daughter and her husband were flying in from Wyoming, because her 
husband owns a private plane," she said. "I didn't know I would be going up." 
</P>
<P>
But, after pilot Roland Rozzelle strapped the San Diego grandmother into the 
five-seat New Bell Jetranger, Clingman reminded her of the 10-year-old promise. 
</P>
<P>
Hoke was joined on the 20-minute flight by Clingman, his 6-year-old daughter, 
Chrissy, and a reporter. The aircraft flew 600 feet over La Jolla, including 
Mt. Soledad, and circled back over the city and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lower than the palm trees," Hoke said as the helicopter roared past La 
Jolla Cove at 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
As the pilot headed to the final site of the sky tour toward the Coronado 
Bridge, Hoke warned him to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to go over the bridge, then do it quick," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the flight was over, she hugged and kissed her grandson and told him that 
it was "very good." 
</P>
<P>
Clingman also planned a surprise birthday party for her Thursday night at the 
Mandarin Dynasty on University Avenue. About 40 friends, some of whom she had 
not seen in years, were expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old free-lance photographer described his grandmother as a hard 
worker. He said she picks up his two daughters from school in her 12-year-old 
car at least three times a week and takes them where they want to go. She 
occasionally baby-sits for the girls, the second one being 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
She also volunteers at two organizations in Balboa Park, the Old Globe Theatre 
and the Hall of Champions, a sports museum. 
</P>
<P>
"She outruns all of us," said Pat Hawkins, administrative assistant at the 
museum. "She's a ball of fire, she whizzes in, does her thing and whizzes out." 
</P>
<P>
For three days each week, Hoke takes care of her 79-year-old bed-ridden sister, 
who also lives in San Diego. And, today, Hoke will attend the Padres game. She 
has season tickets for Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, the great-grandmother of four worked as an escrow officer and is 
a former president of the American Women's Assn. She was born in Brownsville, 
Tex., but has lived in San Diego almost 73 years. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a nut and a crackup," Clingman said. "By the time most people turn 85, 
they're ready to give up the ghost, fold up their chairs and do nothing. But, 
my grandmother goes out to dinner and asks for a scotch on the rocks, has a 
good time and enjoys it."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police said they arrested a speeding motorist who was carrying 300 
pounds of packaged marijuana in a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Garcia, 40, was being held in the County Jail in lieu of $3,000 bail on 
suspicion of marijuana possession and speeding, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said U. S. Customs Service agents asked for 
police help shortly before 10:30 p.m. Wednesday because Garcia was speeding on 
Interstate 5 north of California 52. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer stopped Garcia on I-805 and found the marijuana in the bed of 
the truck, Robinson said.

MORNING BRIEFING: HORNET SUPPORTER GIVES OWNER A GOOD SWIFT KICK IN THE SHINN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlotte Hornet owner George Shinn has threatened to move the club, and Ed 
Peacock, a member of the board that voted to give him a more favorable lease at 
Charlotte Colisuem, said: "George Shinn is a selfish, greedy man." 
</P>
<P>
Peacock said he wasn't surprised by Shinn's threat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting that," Peacock said. "We're also expecting him to name 
himself coach of the Hornets next year and to name himself the starting 
center." 
</P>
<P>
Shinn's height has been listed at 5-feet-3 or 5-4. He says he's 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
Good question: From USA Today: "If Eddie Murray is such an unmotivated player, 
as detractors insist, why has he played in 368 consecutive games?" 
</P>
<P>
Hot stuff: Said John Salley of the Detroit Pistons at a roast of Detroit Red 
Wing Coach Jacques Demers: "The difference between the NHL and the NBA is, if 
you're in last place in the NBA, they fire the coach. If you're in last place 
in the NHL, they give him a roast." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Another thing about the NHL is they've got 5-foot-5 white guys 
making a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Bucky Dent is the 11th different manager hired by George 
Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees. Can you name the other 10? (Answer 
below.) 
</P>
<P>
Add Dent: Of outfielder Deion Sanders, he said: "If he decides to play football 
again, I may end up tackling him myself. He's got a chance to be a heck of a 
baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch: Charlie Metro, who managed Lou Piniella at Kansas City in 1970, told USA 
Today: "Piniella wouldn't run, throw or catch a ball. Not couldn't. Wouldn't. 
'Sweet Lou' makes my all-time, all-star, non-hustler team. . . . He's a 
terrible person." 
</P>
<P>
Heat's on: Digger Phelps managed to squeeze Notre Dame into the NCAA basketball 
tournament, but there's a "Dump Digger" movement in South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Chicago Sun-Times: "On the night of his 400th victory, a win over 
Wichita State, Phelps told the public address announcer not to introduce him 
with the team before the game, as is customary. The Irish had been routed by 
LSU in their previous game, and Phelps knew the razzberries would be coming. 
</P>
<P>
"Phelps said, 'I figured the students would boo me, and I didn't want the kids 
to be distracted.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: From assistant coach Mike Shanahan of the Denver 
Broncos: "Taking the Raider job was a big mistake. I didn't have any 
responsibility. I was told I would be able to take charge, but it didn't work 
out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Sign him up: Manager Whitey Herzog was trying to figure out who would be a good 
man to protect Pedro Guerrero in the St. Louis Cardinals' batting order. 
</P>
<P>
"I need one more switch-hitter," Herzog said. "Mickey Mantle. That's the one. 
That would set it up." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ralph Houk, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Bob Lemon, Dick Howser, 
Gene Michael, Clyde King, Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella and Dallas Green. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Ron Kittle of the Chicago White Sox, admitting to some panic during 
the lockout: "I applied for a Wendy's job. I wonder if I got it." HARLEY

TV-RADIO: DODGER FANS: PUT ON YOUR BLUE PAJAMAS FOR CH. 11 MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They've had "Twilight Zone" and "I Love Lucy" marathons, and now comes a Dodger 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 11, beginning at 11 tonight, will devote 24 hours to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Spanning the 100-year history of the Dodgers, the program will originate from 
Dodger Stadium and conclude Saturday with coverage of the 7 p.m. game against 
the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Wyatt, a producer and host, came up with the idea after last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, it was just a joke," he said. "But (program director) Don Tillman 
liked the idea." 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt and producer Bill Brandt have been working on the project since December. 
They spent two months in New York doing interviews and compiling highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Wyatt, other hosts include Don Drysdale, Ross Porter and Tony Danza. 
</P>
<P>
The program will include tributes to Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Walter 
O'Malley, Walter Alston, Kirk Gibson and Orel Hershiser. More than 70 
celebrities are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Three memorable games, originally televised on Channel 11 and edited into 
one-hour segments, will be shown: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Game 5 of the 1981 National League Championship Series against Montreal, 
won by Rick Monday's home run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pennant-drive showdown against Atlanta on Sept. 11, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A June 26, 1988, game at Cincinnati in which the Dodgers came from behind 
to win in the ninth inning on Steve Sax's three-run double. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m. Saturday, a two-hour special, "100 Years of Blue," will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks after Saturday night's game will also be televised. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the entire 24-hour show will be sent to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, facing Saturdays without baseball, is doing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, NBC had a Jorge Paez fight that drew nearly twice as many viewers 
in Los Angeles as the third round of the Masters on CBS. The fight got an 8.0 
rating, the golf a 4.4. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, NBC's PGA Seniors Championship outdrew the younger guys in the 
Heritage golf tournament on CBS in most markets. The overnight Nielsen for the 
Seniors on Saturday was 3.8, while the Heritage drew a 3.4. The national rating 
was a 3.4 for both golf events. 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday at 1 p.m., NBC tops itself with the first of a series it is 
calling "The Greatest Fights Ever." This show takes an in-depth look at the 
1974 George Foreman-Muhammad Ali fight in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
A replay of this fight hasn't been on network television in 15 years. If you're 
a fight fan, you won't want to miss it. 
</P>
<P>
Add boxing: Here's another show fight fans won't want to miss, if they can get 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Knockout! Hollywood's Love Affair With Boxing," with Anthony Quinn as host, is 
a one-hour special that will be shown for the first time on the American Movie 
Classics cable network next Thursday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights from such boxing films as "City for Conquest," "Requiem for a 
Heavyweight," "Champion," "Somebody Up There Likes Me, "The Set-Up," "Raging 
Bull" and the "Rocky" series are shown. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, himself an amateur boxer, played aging fighter Mountain Rivera in 
"Requiem for a Heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
Recommended viewing: Nadia Comaneci is featured on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" 
Saturday, along with delayed coverage of the Wood Memorial and a report on the 
Paris-Roubaix bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
Donna de Varona and Bart Conner handle the Nadia segment, filmed last weekend 
in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci is not only shown performing but also talks about her relationship 
with Constantine Panait, the married father of four who helped her escape from 
Romania last November, as well as her relationship with Nicolae Ceausescu, 
Romania's leader before being executed during the revolution, and her reported 
suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Of her escape, Comaneci tells Conner she had to crawl on her hands and knees 
through fields that were mined, and had to scale a large fence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a movie," she says. "You have just one chance. If you get caught, 
you don't know what would happen . . . probably something pretty bad. I didn't 
know what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
A number of major Southern California cable companies picked up the wrong ESPN 
feed Tuesday night, bringing the cable network's coverage of the Angels and 
Oakland into this market. What was supposed to have been shown here by all 
Southland cable companies was Minnesota-Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake didn't set too well with Channel 5, which also televised the Angel 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5's telecast got only a 4.9 Nielsen rating. "We should have gotten at 
least a 6," station spokesman Ed Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said the station has sent out letters to cable companies reminding 
them of the proper procedure. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, meanwhile, is making plans to send out scrambled signals to remedy such 
mixups. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it seems hockey is bigger than basketball in Los Angeles -- at least, 
bigger than Clipper basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Many SportsChannel viewers weren't too thrilled last Monday to learn that a 
Clipper-Portland telecast would not only preempt the end of the Minnesota North 
Stars-Chicago Blackhawks game but also cause the Winnipeg Jets-Edmonton Oilers 
game to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel said it was contractually obligated to televise the Clippers 
live. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem SportsChannel is faced with is having to delay some of its 
hockey telecasts because of Dodger or Angel telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
To remedy the situation, SportsChannel is trying to get affiliates to put the 
hockey on an available basic channel, giving subscribers the games free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Film destroyed: Late Monday night, a fire, apparently started by an electrical 
short in a ceiling fan, ravaged the Continental Cablevision studios in the 
Westchester area, causing more than $5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
The cable company has produced its own coverage of Loyola Marymount basketball 
since 1983, plus local high school sports, and all that footage was destroyed 
in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's 11th consecutive year of NFL draft coverage will run from 9 a.m. to 3:30 
p.m. Sunday. Something new this year will be a continual scroll on the bottom 
of the screen, keeping viewers up to date on the selections. . . . Sunday's 
Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, televised to the rest of the nation by ABC, 
will be blacked out in Los Angeles. The race is tentatively scheduled to be 
shown the following Sunday. . . . Saturday's Grand Prix time trials, to be held 
at 11:30 a.m., will be on Prime Ticket that night at 9:30. ESPN will tape five 
support events this weekend, including Saturday's Toyota pro-celebrity race, 
for later airings. Lap-by-lap announcer Paul Page, pit-area reporter Jack 
Arute, Channel 5's Ed Arnold, KLOS' Joe Benson and Power 106's Monica Brooks 
will be among those driving. A rivalry is brewing between Page and Arute, who 
both will wear microphones. In a twist, Emerson Fittipaldi will call the race, 
which will be aired June 17. Arnold, now known as Haybale, has already crashed 
two cars in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket is in the process of moving from Inglewood to new offices at 10000 
Santa Monica Blvd. in Century City. The facility includes a $7-million 
production studio. . . . Tom Kelly, hospitalized for four days after suffering 
severe chest pains on April 8, has recovered. . . . The first segment of this 
year's Steve Garvey Pro Celebrity Sports Series will be shown by Prime Ticket 
Wednesday at 7 p.m. It's a skiing event taped at Deer Valley, Utah, which 
benefits Special Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS baseball game Saturday will be the Angels at Minnesota, with Dick 
Stockton and Jim Kaat reporting. . . . ABC's "Earth Day Special" Sunday at 9 
p.m. includes a segment with Magic Johnson and Michael Douglas. It was filmed 
on March 28 at the Sports Arena after a Laker-Clipper game. . . . CBS has an 
Earth Day-related show tonight at 8, "Dolphins, Whales and Us." Sports director 
Bob Fishman, who has been battling cancer, was a major force behind this show.

Joan Kroc, owner of the Padres, said Thursday that she will resume an active 
role in running the organization following Jerry Kapstein's resignation as the 
team's top executive. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, who has signed a letter of intent to sell the team to a group headed by 
television producer Tom Werner, said she will devote more time to the club 
until the sale is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The deal must be approved at a meeting of major league owners June 12-13 in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Kroc said: "I have postponed my travel plans until the 
sale of the Padres is completed and the club is transferred to the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to be involved in the management of the organization and to 
cheer on our Padres at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium with my fellow fans." 
</P>
<P>
Kapstein resigned his post Wednesday, the same day it was reported that Kroc's 
daughter, Linda Smith, would seek a divorce from Kapstein following 18 months 
of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc had appointed Kapstein as the team's top executive in February, and he 
helped negotiate the recent $75 million sale of the team to a group headed by 
Werner, a Los Angeles resident.

LOPEZ THROWS 2-HITTER TO SPARK NEWBURY PARK TO SOFTBALL WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Senior right-hander Lea Lopez allowed only two hits, struck out eight and 
walked none to lead visiting Newbury Park High to a 3-0 victory over Thousand 
Oaks in a Marmonte League softball game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Newbury Park (13-7, 6-1 in league play) in a first-place tie 
with Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Traci Samuels scored 
from first on a two-base throwing error by sophomore third baseman Angie Nau. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers capitalized on another two-base throwing error to score two more 
runs in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
With Newbury Park runners at first and second, Thousand Oaks first baseman Amy 
Chellevold made a brilliant over-the-shoulder catch of a bunt by Cami Ferris. 
Chellevold, however, overthrew second base in an attempt to double off Melody 
Bolger. By the time the ball could be returned to the infield, both Bolger and 
Marcie James, who was on first, came around to score. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't play the game we're normally used to seeing from them," Newbury 
Park Coach Doug Gove said. "They're a good team, they were just off today." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks finished with six errors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst we've ever played," Thousand Oaks Coach Chuck Brown said. 
"It's tough to play over six errors." 
</P>
<P>
The closest Thousand Oaks came to scoring was in the fifth inning. With one 
out, Nicole Ochoa hit a 2-1 pitch over the head of left fielder Laree Reynolds 
for the game's only double. But Lopez retired the next two batters. 
</P>
<P>
Suzie Klusyk singled in the sixth inning for the Lancers' only other 
baserunner. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, headed for University of the Pacific on a softball scholarship, and 
Bolger led Newbury Park's seven-hit offense with two singles each. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Zinner (15-5) took the loss for the Lancers (15-6, 4-4), who have been 
beset by injuries and eligibility problems. 
</P>
<P>
"(The loss of players) has been really unsettling," Brown said. "We've played 
over it until now, but we couldn't do it today."

EL CAMINO REAL AGAIN FEASTS ON KENNEDY PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cody Beaumaster stood alone along the rail in the Kennedy High dugout, gnawing 
at the sleeve of his baseball jersey as he watched Ryan McGuire of El Camino 
Real retire the side in the seventh inning. With each pitch, Beaumaster bit off 
a chunk of sleeve, spat it out, then started in on another. 
</P>
<P>
By the time McGuire had finished off the visiting Golden Cougars, 12-4, 
Beaumaster had a half-dozen holes in his right sleeve, each the size of, well, 
the ones in his coach's stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had lost to powerful El Camino Real on Wednesday by the same score, but 
the trouble had been knitted long before: The loss was the sixth in seven games 
and fourth in a row in Northwest Valley Conference play for the Golden Cougars 
(12-7, 7-4 in league play), putting them a half-game behind San Fernando in the 
league standings with six games to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I'm upset," said Beaumaster, a junior right-hander. "I don't like to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Beaumaster (4-2) did, and it was over in the blink of an eye. El Camino 
Real (13-1-1, 10-0-1) rolled a six in a first-inning rally that included a 
two-run home run by McGuire and run-scoring hits by Greg Lederman (four hits), 
Josh Massey and Sean Boldt. 
</P>
<P>
By the fourth, Kennedy trailed, 9-1, and Coach Manny Alvarado's patience was 
wearing thin. Ben Guzman reached base on an error to lead off the inning and 
moved to second on Jack Moussa's single, which generated not a peep of support 
from the Kennedy bench. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado temporarily chased the team out of the dugout in an effort to shake 
the lethargy, if not rigor mortis, that has set in. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy managed a pair of earned runs off McGuire (5-0), a senior left-hander 
who allowed seven hits, struck out 10 and walked four. El Camino Real, which 
had just four hits in Wednesday's win, battered Beaumaster for 16 hits -- seven 
for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't really been playing our best," said El Camino Real catcher Bobby 
Kim, who had two doubles and a triple. "This game showed the kind of ball team 
we have." 
</P>
<P>
Beaumaster concedes that he is not sure what kind of team Kennedy has become. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Troy (Bourne) try to pump up the guys," Beaumaster said. "But we're 
just juniors. The other guys look at us like. . . . I try to get us up. Nobody 
listens." 
</P>
<P>
After the team's performance the past two weeks -- Kennedy has been outscored, 
69-19, in its past seven games -- Alvarado's blood pressure is all that's up. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the second-year coach of the defending City Section 4-A Division champions 
steadfastly promised that the bleeding will end. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll change," Alvarado said, jaw set. "It will. This is all about pride and 
desire." 
</P>

CSUN RALLIES TO KNOCK OFF CHAPMAN, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the prospect of falling from second place in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. standings, and three outs from suffering its first 
shutout of the season, Cal State Northridge rallied for a tie, then defeated 
Chapman College, 5-2, in a 12-inning baseball game Thursday at Hart Park in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sims, the No. 9 hitter in the Northridge lineup, slapped a bases-loaded 
double in the top of the 12th to drive in a pair of runs and snap a 1-1 tie. A 
run-scoring single by Greg Shockey and Kyle Washington's sacrifice fly closed 
out the four-run rally and made a winner of Craig Clayton (10-3), who pitched a 
five-hitter in going the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, a right-hander, struck out seven and allowed just one unearned run. 
Chapman starter Pete Coleman (6-5) matched Clayton pitch for pitch, but, with 
two out in the ninth, he walked Scott Sharts, and Denny Vigo and Eric Johnson 
followed with singles to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Although he suffered cramps in his forearm in the late innings, Clayton never 
thought of leaving the game. Between the sixth and 12th innings, Clayton 
allowed just one infield hit. But with a 1-2 count on Chris Cutliff, the 
leadoff batter in the 12th, Clayton threw his glove and the ball to the ground 
and began to massage his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
"It was stuck in one position," Clayton said. "It was the only way I could get 
(my hand) open." 
</P>
<P>
Cutliff hit the next pitch over the left-field fence for his second home run of 
the season. Clayton walked the next batter, but the two pitchers warming up in 
the bullpen weren't needed as Clayton struck out Rod Klopfer and got Mark 
Landeros to hit into a double play to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, CSUN (26-15, 13-6 in conference play) held on to second in the 
CCAA, a game ahead of Chapman (23-16, 13-8).

NARBONNE'S 14-5 VICTORY IS A BIG HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen runs can do wonders to erase frustration. Narbonne High baseball Coach 
Nick Van Lue knows the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Van Lue watched his team leave 15 runners on base in a 6-3 loss 
to Gardena in a Southern Pacific Conference game. On Thursday, host Narbonne 
had 11 hits in a 14-5 victory over Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little team meeting before the game," Van Lue said. "We decided we 
needed to be a little more aggressive at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Richard Fordiani went right to work, hitting a grand slam -- his 
fourth home run of the season -- to cap Narbonne's five-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Eight batters went to the plate in the second inning as Narbonne scored four 
more runs. In the third, Walt Toniolo hit a three-run homer to give the Gauchos 
a 12-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne sophomore right-hander Craig Valenzuela, using a mix of fastballs, 
sliders and split-fingered fastballs, limited Gardena to four earned runs on 
eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman David Inana, who singled, doubled and tripled, led Gardena's 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela started the season as the No. 2 starter, but with a 4-2 record, he 
has become Van Lue's ace. 
</P>
<P>
"Craig keeps the tempo of the ballgame going," Van Lue said. "He works fast and 
stays around the plate, and that keeps the guys behind him in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos backed Valenzuela with sturdy defense. Narbonne shortstop Paco 
Cervantes, who was three of three with a pair of doubles and three RBIs, made a 
nice defensive play in the sixth inning on a ground ball by Gardena's Ramiro 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne improved to 5-6-1 and 5-5-1 in the Southern League. The Gauchos are a 
game behind Washington for the league's berth in the City Section Division 3-A 
playoffs. Gardena dropped to 8-9 and 6-4 in the Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola 15, St. Bernard 6 -- The Cubs battered St. Bernard pitching for 13 hits 
for a non-league victory at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pitching has just fallen apart in the last two games," said St. Bernard 
Coach Bob Yarnall, whose team lost, 20-15, to Loyola on Tuesday. Loyola rallied 
for 11 runs in the top of the seventh inning to erase a 14-9 St. Bernard lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," Yarnall said. "(Loyola is) the type of team that, once they 
get going, they're tough to stop. Everyone looked like King Kong on that team. 
They just kept hitting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, in last place in the Del Rey League, rallied from a 6-0 deficit against 
the Camino Real League co-leaders by scoring four runs in the fourth inning, 
one in the fifth and 10 in the sixth. St. Bernard used five pitchers after 
using seven on Tuesday, when the teams combined for 35 hits, including 11 home 
runs, at St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you wonder," Yarnall said. "We've been getting good pitching until 
this week. It's very sobering. Hopefully we can get it back together against 
Chaminade." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, 11-4 and ranked fifth in the Southern Section 2-A Division, play a 
doubleheader today at Chaminade of West Hills starting at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Dawson drove in four runs on a bases-loaded single and a sacrifice fly, 
Jeff Richardson was two of three with an RBI and two stolen bases, and John 
Coleman was two of four with a stolen base to lead St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro 18, Washington 1 -- Rex Olmeda homered twice and combined with Arnie 
Madrid to drive in eight runs as the Pirates used a 20-hit attack in a 
Southern-Pacific Conference game at San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Olmeda was three of five and Madrid was three of four. Each had four RBIs as 
the Pirates avenged a 5-3 loss to Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro is 10-7-1 and 6-4-1 in conference play heading into Tuesday's game 
against rival Banning at San Pedro. 
</P>

KADLETZ FINALLY FINDS HIMSELF -- AT THE TOP OF THE CRESCENTA VALLEY ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ryan Kadletz is on base so often for Crescenta Valley it is difficult to 
believe that his playing status was so uncertain a month ago. Early in the 
baseball season, his niche on the team was nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
A successful quarterback on the football team, Kadletz first tried catching, 
but his arm proved deadly . . . to his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as baseball is concerned, he has only an average throwing arm," Coach 
Tony Zarrillo said. "It's amazing he can throw a football so well." 
</P>
<P>
Not encouraging words, coming from a coach. So Kadletz moved to right field 
where his performance has been adequate. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't anything to turn an eye," Zarrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Kadletz, who sought a weekly progress report from his coach, requested a move 
from the bottom of the order to the leadoff position. Zarrillo politely 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
"I thanked him for offering but explained to him that he wasn't who we were 
looking for," Zarrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Kadletz's persistence paid off and he was promoted to the top of the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
A wise move. 
</P>
<P>
In 37 at-bats as the leadoff hitter, Kadletz has 17 hits (.459), including 
three doubles and three triples. He has scored 12 runs and has driven in eight. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a whole new player," Zarrillo said. "He's hitting where he wants to hit, 
and he is a competitive young man." 
</P>
<P>
Trading places: Alemany baseball Coach Jim Ozella has done more shuffling than 
a Las Vegas dealer lately, but the gamble has yet to pay off. Despite 
game-by-game lineup changes, the Indians are struggling at 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not the kind of guy that likes to change lineups a lot," Ozella 
said. "This year, I'm changing quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Gabe Villasenor, Jaime Olivares, Leo Tejada and Joey Rosselli 
have played first base; and Steve Pacheco, Rich Dice, Bob Ordona and Eddie 
Bushui have alternated in right field. 
</P>
<P>
Ozella's lineup was so consistent last season that he could have tattooed it on 
his chest. This year, he has varied his approach to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been somewhat of a trying year," he said. "I've coddled them, I've yelled 
at them -- some things that aren't typical of my coaching style. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's missing. Maybe I don't have the right players, maybe it's me. I 
can't see a lot of coaches out there who would be satisfied with being .500." 
</P>
<P>
Cover boy: Westlake catcher Mike Lieberthal, projected to be selected within 
the first three rounds of the major league draft in June, will grace the cover 
of the introductory issue of California Baseball magazine in June. Lieberthal 
will be shown along with Beverly Hills pitcher Rob Wells and El Segundo first 
baseman Tate Seefried. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal was Cal-Hi Sports male athlete of the week in the April 10 issue for 
his four-homer game against Simi Valley that tied a state record. Lieberthal 
will be featured at 11 tonight on "Victory," a weekly show on KADY Channel 63 
in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Records: Channel Islands baseball Coach Don Cardinal has won 390 games in his 
24-year career but he won't reach 400 this season -- the Raiders have only six 
games left. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like I'll have to hang around another year," Cardinal, 57, said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
One-time shot: Kennedy outfielder Garret Anderson, as expected, made his 
pitching debut in the Holt-Goodman tournament. This is one engagement that 
might have bombed on opening night, though. 
</P>
<P>
In 1 2/3 innings of relief in Kennedy's 10-4 loss to Poly, the Fresno 
State-bound center fielder allowed five earned runs on four hits, walked three 
and struck out one. Anderson was tagged with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw hard, he just couldn't find the strike zone," Kennedy Coach Manny 
Alvarado said. "I don't know if he'll be out there again." 
</P>
<P>
On the road: Canoga Park, Thousand Oaks, Royal and Saugus highs will compete in 
the Westmont College summer basketball tournament June 29-July 1 in Santa 
Barbara.

SPRINTER WATTS SUFFERS ANOTHER INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third time in three seasons, USC sophomore sprinter Quincy Watts has 
suffered a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Although the latest mishap -- a strained left hamstring incurred in last 
Saturday's meet at USC's Cromwell Field -- does not appear to be as serious as 
the previous two, it continues a disturbing trend. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Taft High in 1988, Watts strained his right hamstring in a dual 
meet. He strained the same muscle -- lower in the leg -- last season during a 
workout and it ended his freshman season at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on a day-to-day basis right now," USC spokesman Gary Pine said. "He 
definitely won't run at (the Mt. San Antonio College Relays) this week, but 
they're hoping he'll be back for the UCLA dual (Apr. 28)." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Williams, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound All-Marmonte League offensive lineman at 
Camarillo High, said earlier this week that he will attend Princeton of the Ivy 
League next fall. Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has taken over the lead in the CCAA softball standings by 
the slimmest of margins. The Lady Matadors' two-game sweep of UC Riverside last 
week placed CSUN ahead of defending national champion Cal State Bakersfield by 
.042 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is 32-17 overall, 7-1 in CCAA play. Bakersfield is 31-4, 10-2, going 
into Saturday's doubleheader showdown between the schools at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>

It was business as usual for Los Angeles Harbor baseball Coach Jim O'Brien on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien watched L.A. Harbor defeat Mission College, 10-2, and clinch its fifth 
consecutive Southern California Athletic Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien has won 11 conference championships in 15 seasons at the school. L.A. 
Harbor is 37-5 and 16-0 in the conference. Mission is 22-10-1 and 12-5. Mission 
remains in second place in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just coming along right on schedule," O'Brien said. "This is a very 
determined group." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks combined strong pitching with potent hitting to remain undefeated 
at home this season. Starting pitcher Pat Ahearne allowed only two runs and 
three hits in seven innings to improve to 9-1. The sophomore right-hander from 
St. Bernard High tied a school record of 20 victories in a career set by Rod 
Van Lue in the 1976-77 seasons. John Rodriguez and John Matich combined for two 
innings of perfect relief. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor had 14 hits, including eight doubles, a triple, and a pair of home 
runs, both from first baseman Ryan Karp. Shortstop Tony Liebsack had two 
doubles and left fielder George Baker had a double and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Karp, a sophomore, hit a two-run homer in the fourth and a solo homer in the 
sixth. He has four homers. 
</P>
<P>
Mission used three pitchers, but L.A. Harbor did most of its damage against 
starter Nino Romo (5-2), who surrendered four doubles and a home run in the 
fourth inning to give the Seahawks a 4-0 lead. Romo, who didn't give up a hit 
in the first three innings, left the game in the sixth with Mission trailing, 
7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good team we played today," said Mission Coach John Klitsner, a 
former Sylmar High coach. "And when you have any kind of breakdown against them 
you're going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Mission first baseman Eddie Chavez hit a two-run homer in the seventh.

UPSET OR NOT, SOUTHWEST CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM, TOPPLES MONTGOMERY

Southwest's baseball team is tired of having the word "upset" attached to its 
victories. But for now, the unranked and unheralded Raiders will settle for it. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday in a Metro Conference game, Southwest upset seventh-ranked and host 
Montgomery, 3-1, making the top of the league standings a crowded place to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it bothers me that people are calling these upsets," said Southwest Coach 
Tom Hernandez. "We're beating good teams, but we have the talent. I'm very 
happy with the way they're performing." 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. It is the second time this week Southwest has met a 
formidable opponent and come out a winner -- Tuesday it knocked off 
eighth-ranked Sweetwater, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
For Montgomery, is was a giant and costly step backward. The Aztecs (12-6, 4-2) 
began the week undefeated in league, but dropped a 2-1 decision to 10th-ranked 
Hilltop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the best team won today," said Manny Hermosillo, 
Montgomery coach. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest loaded the bases in the sixth with the score tied, 1-1. But relief 
pitcher Luis Arroyo got the next batter to hit into a force out, then 
registered a strikeout and another ground ball out to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried," Hernandez said. "We have been able to play catch-up a lot." 
</P>
<P>
And so in the seventh, Hernandez wasn't surprised when Ernie Negrete led off 
with a single to right, moved to second on a groundout and scored the winning 
run on Carlos Sanchez' RBI single to center. Rafael Padilla walked and a balk 
moved Sanchez and Padilla to third and second, and Sanchez scored on David 
Silva's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Especially impressive was the seven-inning, two-hit performance of sophomore 
Salvador Sanchez (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
"He was awesome," Hernandez said. "We're hoping he'll stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest improved to 7-10, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
In other Metro Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park 3, Sweetwater 1 -- Benji Gil went the distance and threw a 
four-hitter for Castle Park (13-8, 4-2) against eighth-ranked Sweetwater, which 
lost its second game this week to an unranked team. Raul Sanchez and Larry Meza 
combined for a five-hitter for Sweetwater (2-4, 14-6). 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop 17, Bonita Vista 4 -- Chad Mosher went three for four with two triples, 
three runs scored and three RBIs, and Sergio Guzman had a triple, two RBIs and 
scored twice to lead 10th-ranked Hilltop (14-5, 5-1). The Barons are 8-10, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
City Harbor League 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont 17, Christian 2 -- James Gertenslager went two for five with four 
RBIs including a three-run homer and Antoine Henry went three for five with two 
RBIs and two runs scored for Clairemont (11-8, 4-2). 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine 4, Marian Catholic 3 -- Mike Bryant's two-run homer in the fifth 
inning was the deciding blow for St. Augustine. Marian is 5-11, 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
City Western League 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay 11, Kearny 6 -- Marlin Gardinera had four hits and two RBIs and Pat 
Benancourt picked up a victory for Mission Bay. Kearny is 7-11, 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry 12, Morse 6 -- Greg Altmeyer, who went three for four with three 
RBIs, and Dino Distefano, who went two for three with three RBIs, led Patrick 
Henry, which scored seven runs in the third. Patrick Henry is 10-9, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa 8, Serra 1 -- Marc Nielsen threw a four-hitter to pick up his fifth 
win without a loss. Lee McAfee hit a three-run homer in the fourth for 
top-ranked Mira Mesa (16-2, 5-1). 
</P>
<P>
City Central 
</P>
<P>
Hoover 8, Madison 2 -- Disi Jacobs went two for four including a two-run 
triple, Joe Campbell had two hits and two RBIs and Roger Blake had two hits and 
two RBIs for Hoover (6-11, 1-4). Madison fell to 8-9 and 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford 2, Lincoln 1 -- With the bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Chris Townsend 
swung at a pitch over his head and hit a ground rule double, driving home pinch 
runner Anthony Sorrell and Bashiri Cooper to lift the Colts, 13-4, 6-1. Winning 
pitcher Salvador Vidrios (5-2) struck out seven and allowed four hits. Lincoln 
is 5-11, 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal League 
</P>
<P>
Julian 2, Santa Fe Christian 1 -- Travis Denmark hit a one-out, bases-loaded 
single in the bottom of the seventh inning for Julian (10-4, 4-1). Denmark 
(6-3) also pitched, striking out 10 and allowing only two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Pt. Loma 3 -- Winning pitcher Kian Sly homered to lead the Cavers. 
Matt Ray led Pt. Loma (10-10) with two doubles and a single. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado 5, University City 1 -- Jason Fledderjohn went two for two with an RBI 
and James Skaalen won his fourth game without a loss for the Islanders (12-6, 
5-2). University City is 5-12, 1-4. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

Stock prices skidded for a second straight session Thursday as disappointing 
corporate earnings, soft bond prices and inflation worries joined to make Wall 
Street woozy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 20.94 to 2,711.94, extending its 
drop over the last two sessions to 53.83 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 511 up, 968 down and 521 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume edged up to 152.93 million shares from 147.13 million on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices plunged Wednesday on talk that Japanese investors were bailing out 
of U.S. Treasury securities, driving stocks to their steepest losses in two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds steadied Thursday, slipping only marginally, but yields stayed near their 
highest levels in almost a year. As bond prices fall, their yields rise. 
</P>
<P>
The upward pressure on interest rates follows a government report Tuesday that 
consumer prices rose a sharp 0.5% last month, pushing the first-quarter 
inflation rate to its highest level in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"When rates are possibly going higher, it's hard for investors to think very 
positively about the stock market," said Jack Barbanel, president of First 
Global Asset Management. "With bonds being close to 9% versus stocks, people 
are much better off being in the bond market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But investors stayed wary of bonds on concerns about the Japanese, key buyers 
of U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sensitive to the prospect of higher rates, and the rumors that the 
Japanese are not only not buying our bonds, but may be selling them, makes this 
a not very stable market," said Monte Gordon, research director at Dreyfus 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also said investors were giving mixed reviews to first-quarter 
corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
While a few companies have chalked up better than expected showings, analysts 
say the positive surprises haven't been consistent enough to bolster confidence 
in the market as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Digital Equipment rose 2 1/8 to 82 1/8 in active trading. The company posted a 
big drop in quarterly profits, but many Wall Streeters had been expecting the 
news to be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Seagate Technology plunged 3 1/8 to 12 1/2 after reporting quarterly earnings 
of 44 cents a share -- 10 cents shy of Wall Street estimates. The company has 
been losing ground to other computer disk drive makers, including Conner 
Peripherals. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive common and preferred shares were among the largest percentage 
gainers in over-the-counter trading, on optimism that the insurance company's 
financial condition isn't as bad as previously feared. The company has been 
hard hit recently by worries about its large junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive common shares jumped 3/8, or 15.8%, to 2 3/4; its Series E 
preferred shares rose 1 3/8 to 5 7/8; its preferred Series F gained 1 5/8 to 8 
3/4, and its preferred Series H rose 1/2 to 3. Comdisco tumbled 8 1/2 to 18, 
suffering the day's biggest percentage setback, as the computer leasing company 
projected a substantial decline in its quarterly profits. 
</P>
<P>
Reebok lost 1 1/2 to 17 1/2 after reporting a quarterly earnings gain that fell 
short of estimates. 
</P>

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the most active Big Board issue, jumped 1 to 4 1/4 
on takeover rumors and speculation.

Bond Prices Firm After 2-Day Slump 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices stabilized at a slightly lower level in light trading after two 
days of sharp drops. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or about $1.56 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.84% from 
8.83% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lanier, a trader with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said there was 
little economic news to affect the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, bond prices dropped steeply over fears of inflation and reports 
that Japanese investors, who are major buyers of U.S government bonds, were 
selling the issues. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.938%, up from 8.375% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Rumors Send Dollar Down Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed in domestic foreign exchange trading, losing ground 
against a revived Japanese yen but rising against most other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said rumors in the markets that the Japanese were about to push their 
interest rates higher -- placing the yen in a better position to compete with 
the dollar -- put pressure on the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc., said the dollar 
has not performed as well as might have been expected in recent days, given an 
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit and an increase in market interest rates 
in the United States this week. 
</P>
<P>
Barbanel said exchange rates may be stabilizing, or foreign currencies may be 
enjoying a technical bounce after the dollar's recent rise. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas dealers said the yen's modest recovery after weeks of declines was a 
result of a range of events, notably a rebound on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and 
reported comments from U.S. Treasury officials that they viewed the dollar as 
too strong. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed in Tokyo at 157.75 yen, down 2.12 yen from the Wednesday 
close. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 156.40 yen. In New York, the 
dollar fell sharply to 157.25 yen from 158.125 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at $1.6448 in London, up from $1.6347 late 
Wednesday. In New York, the pound fetched $1.6450, up from $1.6400.

OIL JUMPS ON NEWS OF SPECIAL OPEC MEETING

<P>
Crude oil futures rose sharply Thursday after OPEC ministers agreed to hold an 
emergency meeting on May 2 to try to brake the recent price slide that pushed 
crude to its lowest levels in 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rallied immediately after word spread that the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries had decided to call a special session of its eight-member 
monitoring panel. 
</P>
<P>
Sadek Boussena of Algeria, the cartel's acting president, said an urgent 
meeting was necessary, "given the persistence of the deterioration registered 
on the international oil market." 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting will examine the measures needed to halt the constant degradation 
of the market and to raise prices so as to re-establish them at the level set 
by OPEC," Boussena said in a statement released by Algerian officials in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, jumped 
$1.10 per 42-gallon barrel to settle at $18.06 on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. Other contracts also gained. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has decided to take it very bullishly," Nick Antill, analyst at the 
London-based investment firm of County NatWest, said of OPEC's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The crude had been trading in the range of $20 to $21 a barrel early in April. 
It plummeted nearly 90 cents in the two previous sessions, finishing at its 
lowest since December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have been pummeled on reports that OPEC was exceeding its own output 
limits at a time of seasonal declines in demand by oil consuming nations. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of seven crudes used as the cartel's reference plummeted to 
$15.38 a barrel last week, compared to $17.12 a barrel in the first week of 
April and well below OPEC's target price of $18 a barrel.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: WITH THE 1991 ESCORT, FORD HAS ITS BEST IDEA FOR SUBCOMPACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a quality feel to each part and a promise of durability to the whole 
that says just one thing about the car: Made In Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Switches have a soft, solid click, and these knobs and levers are not going to 
fall off any time soon. The car's suspension is a close friend of the steering 
that agrees absolutely with the transmission. So even daunting corners can be 
conquered with brio. 
</P>
<P>
The doors actually fit better than a pair of Reeboks, one of the most 
comfortable configurations coming out of Asia these days. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this 1991 Escort is built by Ford which is about as American as junk bonds, 
cheese steaks and Wayne, Mich., where the subcompact is assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The second shocker is that this spunky little plum is a subcompact. 
</P>
<P>
For as recently as, say, last month, the only insult higher than noting 
something handled like a big American car was to say it performed like a a 
small American car. 
</P>
<P>
With the new Escort, the pejorative dies. 
</P>
<P>
Here is probably the peppiest, most integrated and best-handling American 
subcompact ever. It is the best idea from Ford since the 1965 Mustang and a 
perfect addition to the Escort marque that for six of the past eight years has 
been the best-selling car in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Only freeway time and traffic will tell, of course, but during its maiden miles 
there was enough cohesion and tautness in the Escort test vehicle to suggest 
that at 24,000 miles it will not be rattling like a garbage sack filled with 
beer cans. 
</P>
<P>
And with power steering, cruise control, air conditioning, automatic 
transmission, rear window defroster and a tilt steering wheel squeezed into a 
five-door hatchback costing only $11,000, here is a high-value vehicle where 
Ford gets the warranty -- of better revenues and a stronger position in a 
domestic industry that is all downturn and shortfall these days. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Ford didn't exactly go wrench-to-wrench with Japan in building a 
better buzz box from the ground up and from domestic parts bins. It did have a 
little help from Mazda. And as Ford is a 25% owner in Mazda, there wouldn't be 
much point to the partnership if you couldn't borrow a cup of technology once 
in a while. 
</P>
<P>
So Ford -- at an estimated saving of $1 billion in engineering costs -- has 
based its Escort on the proven and pleasant underbody, transmission, brakes and 
suspension of the Mazda 323. The engine (with the exception of a sportier, 
multivalve Mazda engine installed in the GT version) is a Ford product. So is 
the steering, the shape of the car, its overall engineering, sheet metal and 
most of the internal bits. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of the Escort's design work was done on Mazda's computers. But from 
the standpoint of hardware, less than 20% of the Escort -- excluding the GT 
again -- is implanted from Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
It feels more like 90%. 
</P>
<P>
And that's because the compatibility and solidness of any good car is much more 
a question of precise, fully monitored assembly than a simple matter of making 
good parts. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing just that, Ford sent 350 key workers from its Escort development team 
to Hiroshima, Japan, to study Mazda's production tooling, the philosophy of 
team engineering and error management as a responsibility of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese metal presses were installed at the Michigan plant. Ford adopted 
Mazda's techniques of robotic brazing and laser alignment. And bolted parts 
were attached through holes, not slots. 
</P>
<P>
The American way, said a Ford spokesman, has always been to join steel parts by 
passing attachment bolts through slots. Items that weren't a precise fit, he 
said, could always be jiggled and shoved into approximate place. In time, of 
course, those small misalignments become adult rattles. 
</P>
<P>
"But with holes, something either fits or it doesn't and if it doesn't fit, it 
doesn't come off the line," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Aesthetically, the Escort (which enters Southern California showrooms Thursday 
and will also be marketed as the Mercury Tracer) resembles a small Taurus. Or a 
same-size Mazda Protege. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly is sleeker than last year's model. But whether a station wagon, a 
two-door GT (the prettiest pick of the litter) or a five-door hatchback, the 
entire line shines with a uptown elegance that effectively denies its midtown 
affordability. 
</P>
<P>
If only something could be done about the wheels, a perennial contradiction by 
car manufacturers who continue to cosset their customers with side window 
demisters and every consideration down to cup holders and cargo lights. 
</P>
<P>
Then they slap a set of plastic picnic plates over steel wheels that have all 
the stylistic charm of wire coat hangers, and with straight face offer these as 
"full luxury covers." 
</P>
<P>
The Escort's interior -- especially its back-lighted instruments and those 
Mazda control stalks with the wholesome clicks -- is familiar and friendly. In 
keeping with today's preoccupation with a place for everything, there's a full 
complement of dash trays, glove boxes, cup holders, and assorted temporary 
storage places for audio tapes, keys, meter change and bubble gum wrapped in 
gas receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Bucket seats up front and the rear bench seat (with a 60-40 split for skis and 
pool cues in the trunk) are well up to commuter comforts. And the positioning 
of seats in the cabin certainly offers more knee, elbow and wriggling room than 
last year's Escort. 
</P>
<P>
But informational lettering on the radio has shrunk to microscopic and consider 
this example of mucked up priorities: The Ford logo on the radio has absolutely 
no function but is exactly two-thirds larger that the squinty letters and 
numbers trying to tell us how the radio works. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl and cloth around the cabin are of standard quality with no excesses. But 
one color choice -- the shrieking scarlet chosen for Escort's upholstery -- 
could take some muting and a movement closer to burgundy. Right now, the red 
falls somewhere between a blood bank and the inside of a pomegranate. 
</P>
<P>
On the road, however, the Escort is tight, solid harmony and balance. Its 
1.9-liter engine and 88-horsepower will not fill ears with the noise of power 
nor a soul with that bug-eyed appreciation of rapid motion. 
</P>
<P>
But the car will get you anywhere -- from vacation destination, to office and a 
day doing Melrose -- with poise, gentleness and considerable refinement. Also, 
without the sense of inadequacy that has been known to occur when driving 
domestic cars with a base price of $8,674. 
</P>
<P>
The automatic transmission -- thanks to Ford's decision to adjust the Escort's 
throttle for quicker response -- produces some mild jolts and surges in the 
kick-down mode. And it does get raspy. But a little management of footwork on 
long inclines or in passing situations will take the surprise out of that. 
</P>
<P>
The combination disc/drum brakes perform soundly and there's stopping power to 
spare. It is a front-wheel drive car with sufficient neutrality of handling to 
suggest a rear-wheel drive car. At no time does the steering lie about the set 
of the wheels and when combined with the optimum balance of the car, previously 
tricky corners become potential fun. 
</P>
<P>
At long last. Domestic fahrvergnugen.

RATHER HELPED FOSTER MEDIA 'MEDIOCRITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Rather says when he is off the tube, "Television news and newspapers are in 
danger of sinking into a miasma of mediocrity" (Newsmakers, April 10). 
</P>
<P>
But only on little-watched PBS would you hear such a thing on air, then only by 
Bill Moyers. Rather's CBS evening news will never talk about the demise and 
trivialization of the mass media on prime time or any time. 
</P>
<P>
Rather questions pollsters who say, "real people care only about entertainment, 
sex and cats." But Rather has played a key role in fostering such a mind-set. 
He may be a journalist, but he functions as an entertainer, to keep people 
watching between the advertisements.

PELLI CLARIFIES POSITION ON TRUMP PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My views as presented in Leon Whiteson's article ("Skyscrapers: From Here to 
Eternity," March 27) are correct on the general issues, but not as they address 
Donald Trump's proposed project for the Ambassador Hotel site. I do not 
remember ever being interviewed on the matter, of which I know very little. 
</P>
<P>
If these comments were taken from the question and answer session after my 
recent lecture at Cal Poly Pomona in Los Angeles, then my views were part of a 
general exchange in which the audience had much more to say than I did on the 
matter. I don't remember uttering the expressions attributed to me. 
</P>
<P>
First, I began by saying that I know very little about the project. Second, I 
said that a commercial development in the mid-Wilshire District would be vastly 
more appropriate than a school. Third, when asked about a proposed full-fledged 
shopping center, I wondered about its feasibility in a location so far from the 
freeways. Now I understand that the proposed mass transit system has a stop on 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, I never spoke of a prime historic section of Wilshire Boulevard. Except 
for the hotel itself, there is not much left of any historic value. Fifth, 
although I have fond personal memories of the building, it is not one of 
significant architectural value. Sixth, I have the greatest respect for Donald 
Trump's abilities as a developer. I would not pretend to have more wisdom than 
he does about the project. Seventh, it is obvious that a healthy ego is a 
required quality in attempting a project of that scope. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth and last of all, not only am I not against the project, I would have 
been happy to serve as the architect, although I believe he has retained the 
quite capable firm of Pereira Associates for this undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
I hope these statements clarify my views on the matter. 
</P>

AFRIKANERS AGAINST APARTHEID AREN'T RARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Kraft's excellent article on Andre Brink on April 17 has one significant 
misstatement. He says that Brink, as an Afrikaner, is a rarity in 
anti-apartheid literature. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Brink has many peers in his Afrikaans community. 
</P>
<P>
A generation ago, when Afrikaans authors began to seriously attack the 
shibboleths of their society, the novelists earned the collective title Die 
Sestigers, or Men of the Sixties. One could name a dozen writers, including 
Prof. J. M. Coetzee of Pochefstroom University who won the coveted Booker Prize 
in England. Athol Eugard is both a playwright and novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were they all male. The sentimental novel about apartheid in Afrikaans was 
written by Elsa Joubert. Entitled "Poppy Nogena," it traces the endless trials 
and tribulations of a black domestic battered hither to yon by government 
regulations. It was a sensational bestseller in Afrikaans, was translated into 
English and became a successful play. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their past sins, Afrikaners are redeeming themselves as a moral people 
in their churches, their politics and their literature. Andre Brink is a fine 
example and Kraft does him justice. But he is not a rarity.

For Madonna wannabes too modest to wear their underwear topside, Los Angeles 
designer and professional singer Zoe Fox has made a line of hand-painted 
shirts, leggings and bicycle shorts with sexy undergarments drawn on the 
outside. They are just the ticket for people who want to celebrate Lingerie 
Week (April 22-29) in public. 
</P>
<P>
A lacy, black merry widow (pictured here) with rosettes and rhinestones adorns 
a man's vintage dress shirt, $160. A V-neck white T-shirt is painted with a 
gilded rose bra, $120. Leggings to match the shirts in black or white sport 
trompe-l'oeil garters, tattoos and lacy polka dot panties -- the bicycle-length 
are $80; ankle-length, $120. 
</P>
<P>
The collection, called Cupid City, is available at Tilly &amp; Mac in Venice 
and by special order at Soho On Montana in Santa Monica. JOANNA DENDEL

<P>
Attitudes toward California seem to harden as one travels east, mellowing only 
after the international dateline is crossed. This tentative theory may explain 
why New Yorkers and Londoners write satiric books about us while the Japanese 
scramble to annex us. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Barnes, the central character in this novel by an Englishwoman now living 
here, would never have come to Los Angeles if the ceiling of her London flat 
hadn't fallen in. Susan is a literary scholar, at work on an introduction to a 
new edition of Jane Austen's "Emma," a task she finds impossible to complete 
under a shower of plaster. When a letter from her cousin Joanna arrives with a 
glowing description of her blissful life in Southern California, Susan 
impulsively decides to visit the city "she'd always associated with sun-beached 
surfers, movie stars and Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Once recovered from jet lag, Susan finds herself enjoying Los Angeles despite 
her misgivings. Joanna has turned the garage into a guest room for her cousin; 
her handsome filmmaker husband Mike actually seems pleased at the thought of a 
house guest, and the beach is within walking distance. Reluctantly, Susan 
acknowledges that the place may actually have some merits. There are even 
"well-thumbed" books in the house, an amenity Susan hadn't expected. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Joanna has changed. Once a fiercely talented painter, she has become 
an art teacher, turning out blandly pretty pictures in her spare time, 
demonstrating that once an artist moves here, she will never do any good work 
again. Contentment has blurred her edges and broadened her hips, alterations 
perceived by Susan as ominous. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of using her summer vacation profitably, Joanna seems happy to spend 
her days reading romances and her evenings playing earth mother to undeserving 
acquaintances. Susan, on the other hand, has remained lean and ambitious in 
London, her wit honed by her affair with her publisher, a married man with no 
intentions whatever of leaving his wife. Joanna considers this situation 
deplorable, and would like nothing better than to see her cousin a happily 
married convert to the Southern California lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting her hosts' circle of friends, a haphazard and stereotypical mix 
including an unhappy homosexual pair, a promiscuous actress between jobs and a 
vacuous couple who epitomize yuppiehood in the late '80s, Susan finds her 
initial enthusiasm fading. Only one member of the group is familiar with Jane 
Austen; the food and wine taste equally of sugar, and she feels as if she might 
be drowning "in a butt of Malmsey," though she has become so Californianized 
that she can't remember the source of the quote. Worse still, Joanna's 
mother-in-law Eileen has attempted to fix her up with a young doctor, a gesture 
Susan finds grossly insulting. 
</P>
<P>
After Susan sees a man shoot a woman on a Venice street, her disenchantment is 
complete. Happily, her English lover Felix will be in Los Angeles for a few 
days, and they'll be able to demolish the California cliches together. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, when Felix arrives, looking "unwholesome and grey," he suffers by 
comparison to Joanna's appealing husband Mike. Felix's acerbic wit seems to 
have suffered a sea (or air) change, and his comments seem egregiously flip and 
ill-natured. 
</P>
<P>
When Susan tells him about the street murder, he quite fails to see its 
significance. Susan "took a sip of her wine, distancing herself from him, 
wondering whether it was the Los Angeles air that presented him in so 
unattractive a light." 
</P>
<P>
In a sudden apercu, Susan realizes that she's fallen in love with Mike, 
becoming yet another victim of his careless and superficial charm. Clearly, 
Susan must return to London at once, while she still can salvage the moral 
integrity so imperiled by her sojourn among the tofu-eaters and adulterers. 
</P>
<P>
Just before her departure, Joanna's well-meaning, widowed mother-in-law invites 
her to a farewell dinner. "Susan smiled, her old, acid London smile. 'If you're 
so desperate for company,' she asked, 'why don't you buy a guinea pig?' " So 
much for that vaunted tart English wit, which makes Californian insincerity 
seem adorable. 
</P>
<P>
We leave Susan boarding the plane to London, sadder and wiser, having confirmed 
the Myth of the Mindless Surfer and successfully resisted its insidious lure.

Question: I've followed your advice about reading labels on the food I buy, and 
it's really been a valuable piece of advice. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes I'm not clear about what the label is telling me. For example, if 
a label says the food does not have cholesterol, does that mean it doesn't have 
much saturated fat? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A cholesterol-free food can be either high or low in saturated fat.

2 Live Crude: The rap group 2 Live Crew performed their regular risque 
repertoire in a packed Gainesville, Fla., nightclub Thursday, despite a 
prosecutor's threats to arrest the rappers on obscenity charges if they didn't 
clean up their lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
The group had an attorney on standby during the one-night stand, and bail money 
available if Len Register, state attorney, had followed up on his threat. 
Register said he would have the band arrested if they played uncensored 
versions of songs such as "Me So Horny," and "Move Somethin," which have lyrics 
referring to sadomasochistic sex and violence against women. The prosecutor had 
called the crew's songs "the most filthy thing I've ever encountered." GREG

Church Group Protests Exhibit: A pornography-fighting Christian group in 
Washington is blanketing Congress with envelopes containing "filthy" pictures 
of homosexual acts from a taxpayer-funded art exhibit at Illinois State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The American Family Assn. has sent envelopes marked "extremely offensive 
material enclosed" to the legislators. The envelopes contain reproductions of 
drawings and photos from the "David Wojnarowicz, Tongues of Flame" show that 
was mounted with a $15,000 federal grant from the National Endowment for the 
Arts. The group wants lawmakers to kill funding for the NEA grant. GREG BRAXTON

See You in Court, Pal: Actress-model Lauren Hutton has filed a lawsuit against 
fellow actress and friend Beverly D'Angelo for breaking her leg in a car 
accident last August. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that D'Angelo, who was driving a rented vehicle, backed into 
Hutton as she was waiting to get into the car on a Hollywood Hills street. 
Hutton's attorney Richard Bisetti said the accident put Hutton in a cast for 
eight weeks. He said the suit was just filed to "protect Miss Hutton's rights." 
Hutton is seeking an unspecified amount for medical expenses and other damages 
from D'Angelo and Budget Rent-A-Car. Bisetti said the actresses were still 
"good friends." GREG BRAXTON

'LISA' A SLASHER EPIC WITH A SITCOM SHEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Which is better: bad movies that are up-front about their crumminess, or bad 
movies that try to cover up the sleaze with silks and polish? 
</P>
<P>
"Lisa" (citywide) is a piece of pre-digested pathology. It's a psycho-thriller 
about a 14-year-old girl who carries on an anonymous phone flirtation with a 
crazed serial sex killer, a maniac who eventually gets her address and tries to 
murder her mother. Forget the standard absurdities that fuel this story; 
underneath it's a pretty rank, gamy fantasy. It flirts with pedophilia, sadism, 
maybe even necrophilia. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the director, Gary Sherman, and his highly gifted cinematographer Alex 
Nepomniaschy, drown the movie in TV-commercial swank, creamy colors and coy 
sitcom jabber. The script has been shaped to exclude most of the blood and 
guts, the slasher arias, until the last scenes. 
</P>
<P>
The movie plays up the pubescent cuteness of the central character, pretty-pure 
demure-brunette Lisa (Staci Keanan) and her giggly little chum, Wendy (Tanya 
Fenmore), who has frizzy black hair and a smile wider than Annette Funicello's. 
In the central scenes, Lisa and Wendy -- like the madcap teens in the old Peter 
Sellers comedy, "The World of Henry Orient," tail this killer around Los 
Angeles. Later, Lisa carries on a husky, honey-voiced phone seduction. The 
killer listens like a coiled cat, predatory, ready to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
This killer, Richard (D. W. Moffett), is an oddball concept, a charming, 
male-mannikin Angeleno restaurant manager, who carries on candlelight 
seductions of his victims as he throttles them. Newspapers call him "The 
Candlelight Killer." He lives in a bare room, awash in blue light, works out, 
and when he kills, he first establishes himself with a message on the answering 
machine -- "I'm in the room and I'm going to kill you" -- before popping out of 
the woodwork. In a way, Richard is an L.A. joke, a restaurant joke, an 
answering-machine joke. A joke is what he remains. 
</P>
<P>
"Lisa" is a modern fear-of-sex thriller -- in the "Fatal Attraction," "Blue 
Velvet," "Jagged Edge" mold -- and it's plain that it was made by people who 
are aware of all the complaints about slasher movies: that they're anti-female, 
exploitative, drenched in cadenzas of perverse violence. Perhaps because of 
this, Sherman plays up a quasi-feminist angle. His heroines, mother Katherine 
(Cheryl Ladd) and daughter Lisa, live alone, without male protectors. They have 
to face this ravaging seducer-slayer by themselves -- with only Mace and 
cliches to defend them. They have a chummy, open relationship -- and at one 
strange point, there's a scene where Lisa seems to be dangling her mother in 
front of the killer, deliberately tantalizing him. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine is an unwed mother keeping Lisa from boys because she's afraid she'll 
suffer the same fate. That makes "Lisa" a cautionary tale of sorts. It suggests 
that post-Baby Boom mothers, who went through the orgiastic '70s, shouldn't 
repress their kids because they'll wind up carrying on phone flirtations with 
serial killers. The movie toys with some provocative ideas and then muffles 
them. Impish Wendy is the dark force that tempts Lisa to sexual revolt, then 
she lectures her to quit. Lisa is demure and repressed, then she swears like a 
spoiled-rotten brat. 
</P>
<P>
"Lisa" left me feeling queasy and cheated -- mostly because of the dialogue, 
which is the usual bright, empty TV chitchat, vacuous and thinly programmed 
with giggles and zingers and everyday blah -- but also because I had the 
feeling that, if the subject were done properly, it would be offensive, should 
be offensive, and that to try to clean it up like this made it even more so. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman, who co-wrote this script with Karen Clark, may be a director who 
shouldn't write, or even co-write, his own scripts. He has interesting visual 
ideas -- like the "behind-the-mirror" underworld he and the effects people and 
Nepomniaschy conjured up in "Poltergeist 3" -- but his plots are polyethylene, 
his characters are dull chrome and his ear for dialogue is glued to his TV set. 
"Lisa" (rated PG-13, despite violence, sex and language) isn't ineffective. 
It's shaped in the usual sadistic way that leaves some audiences howling with 
blood-lust by the climax. But it's basically a nasty movie that tries to end up 
nicey-nice: a house-cat of a sex-thriller that wants to claw the hell out of 
you and then curl up to warm milk and velvety hugs.

IMPASSIONED POSTERS CHANGED THE FACE OF POSTWAR GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nov. 9, 1918. Kaiser Wilhelm abdicates power of a bruised and battered Germany. 
Within hours, a new republic is declared. A coalition of socialists forms a 
provisional government and announces a January date for the country's first 
democratic elections. Suddenly, the war-weary nation awakes. 
</P>
<P>
Censorship rules lapse, a paper shortage eases and posters swathe the urban 
landscape in fiery political rhetoric. The bold color used by German artists 
"transformed the cities into pyrotechnic tapestries," according to historian 
Ida Katherine Rigby. Between the November Revolution and the January elections, 
wrote a contemporary observer, "Berlin's streets rioted in color orgies, the 
houses exchanged their gray faces for an agitated mask." 
</P>
<P>
A selection of these impassioned posters now hangs on the spare white walls of 
the Photowest/W. Bradley Lemery gallery downtown. Tamed somewhat by the new 
surroundings, many of the works nevertheless refuse to be declawed, their 
fierce color and searing imagery stretching resolutely over the vast 
chronological and geographical divide. 
</P>
<P>
An image of a bony, ashen hand poised over a quiet village portends impending 
danger. The poster's caption links the threat to Bolshevism and urges Germans 
to protect their homeland from the forces that assumed power over Soviet Russia 
the year before. Determined to prevent Germany's November Revolution from 
veering toward the anarchism and extremism associated with Soviet Russia's 
October Revolution, the provisional government launched a fervent campaign to 
instill order, to cease agitation in the streets and appeal to workers to 
return to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Posters became instrumental in this campaign, and those commissioned by the 
government's publicity committee took their places on the streets beside those 
issued by political parties and private anti-Bolshevik leagues. The 
Novembergruppe, a band of artists and writers committed to upholding the values 
of the socialist-led revolution, carried out many of the commissions with the 
same Expressionist fury they brought to their paintings and prints. 
</P>
<P>
More intelligible, perhaps, were posters in the style of O.H.W. Hadank's "Work 
Is Deliverance." The bold red block letters confirm the image below, of a 
monumental sower, spreading seeds across the new Germany. While the old nation 
stands in flames and ruins beneath a stormy sky, the new gleams in the light of 
the rising sun, a common symbol of the nascent republic. Radiant and orderly, 
the new world thrives through the labor of its citizens, the workers in 
distant, churning factories, and the strong, stern-faced sower. 
</P>
<P>
Whether drawn in the violent black shards of Expressionism, in an older, more 
staid style of illustrational realism, or a melodramatic mode in between, the 
posters here state their case with bold insistence. The contemporary viewer, 
however, is faced with a challenge similar to that imposed on the German worker 
of 1918-19. While the worker could read the words but not the imagery of the 
more innovative posters, the present audience can grasp the power of the images 
but not the words. The gallery has provided only sporadic translations, and 
without these, the posters shout in a muffled voice, commanding in tone but 
elusive in meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The richness of this material, historically as well as visually, deserves a 
more thoughtful approach than it has earned here. Thematic groupings and more 
precise information about the social and political contexts from which the work 
emerged would help it do what it meant to do -- communicate and not just 
decorate. 
</P>
<P>
Though the show is named "Novembergruppe," it is doubtful that all of the work 
here was made by members of that group. Many of the posters bear the torch 
insignia of the Werbedienst, the government's publicity office, but many do 
not. A campaign poster for the German National People's Party, for instance, a 
faction that remained loyal to the conservative values of the Kaiser's Germany, 
seems an unlikely Novembergruppe commission. 
</P>
<P>
This eclectic selection of posters, culled from three private collections, 
nevertheless reflects the extraordinarily fickle nature of German politics 
between the wars. Even in retrospect, the period refuses a fixed definition. 
Its 17 different governments in 15 years suffered contradictions, clashes and 
dangerous ambiguities -- problems that this show, too, cannot overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Novembergruppe" continues at Photowest Gallery (744 G St., Suite 205) through 
April 30.

STAGE WATCH: GNU THEATRE EMBROILED IN CONTROVERSY ON TWO FRONTS;

<P>
LEGAL MOVES: THE COMPANY MOUNTS A PLAY IN DEFIANCE OVER RIGHTS AND FACES AN 
INQUIRY INTO FINANCES.

No news would be good news for the Gnu Theatre in North Hollywood. Instead, the 
50-seat theater, best known for its multi-award-winning production of "El 
Salvador" in 1988, is at the center of two controversies that bubbled into 
public view this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Gnu is about to open Lee Blessing's "Independence" concurrent with another 
production of the show only a few miles away -- despite the fact that the Gnu's 
rights to the play were withdrawn. An administrator with the company that 
licenses rights to the play said this would be the first time in his six years 
on the job that a theater has openly defied the company's withdrawal of rights. 
</P>
<P>
And in an unrelated matter, the state attorney general's office -- acting as 
the agency that oversees nonprofit "public benefit" corporations -- is 
investigating the management of the Gnu in response to complaints of 
mismanagement and deceit filed by the theater's former managing director, 
Elizabeth Reilly. Gnu artistic director Jeff Seymour denied Reilly's 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Gnu plans to open "Independence" Thursday. The Burbank Theatre Guild will 
open the authorized "Independence" one day later. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank producers, veteran sound designer Jon Gottlieb and actress Rhona 
Blaker, have held the local "professional" rights to "Independence" since 
January, 1989. At one point in early 1989, Blaker inquired about the 
possibility of a production at the Gnu, but Seymour wasn't interested. Gottlieb 
and Blaker decided to do the show in Burbank, but their production was delayed 
because of a city-ordered renovation of the 99-seat theater's lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
By last January, Seymour decided he wanted to do the play at the Gnu after all 
-- but on a "non-professional" pay scale. He obtained the "non-professional" 
rights from Dramatists Play Service -- the New York firm which licenses 
professional and non-professional productions of this and many other plays and 
collects the royalties for the playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
(The Burbank rights to the play are "professional" because its producers plan 
to pay the actors -- including former TV stars Marion Ross and Lauren Tewes -- 
a minimum of $75 a week, the level at which Dramatists Play Service defines 
"professional" and guarantees a degree of exclusivity within a radius of 50 
miles. By contrast, the Gnu's payments to actors average about $8 per 
performance; the Gnu's "Independence" will play three performances a week.) 
</P>
<P>
When Gottlieb and Blaker learned of Seymour's plans, they protested. Dramatists 
Play Service responded by withdrawing rights from the Gnu -- but not before 
Seymour had auditioned 400 actors for his production, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Pospisil, the Dramatists Play Service's non-professional rights 
administrator, acknowledged in a telephone interview that he didn't check with 
the professional rights administrator, Anthony Damato, before he approved 
Seymour's request for non-professional rights. It was "a regrettable 
circumstance," he said, but he added that "no specific contract is ever really 
signed for the (non-professional) rights." Added Damato: "We have the legal 
right to withdraw permission for (non-professional) rights at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour has "no problem" with both productions going on at the same time. 
"People aren't going to stand at the crossroads, trying to decide which one to 
go to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gottlieb believes the Gnu production "impacts the profitability of my show. 
It's only 2 miles away, it's confusing to the audience, and now I'll be 
compared to another production. I didn't put in all this time and money (he 
estimates he has invested $10,000) to turn it into a high school skit contest." 
Indeed, he said that he and Blaker secured the professional rights -- despite 
the small size of the theaters they considered using -- because they wanted 
exclusivity and the ability to move their production to a larger venue without 
having to renegotiate rights. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb said he will "take legal action" -- if Dramatists Play Service doesn't 
go to court on his behalf. Damato said he couldn't predict what his company's 
attorneys would do. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Seymour already faces legal action from Reilly, his former Gnu 
colleague and ex-girlfriend. In documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court 
last August and in February, Reilly accused Seymour of mismanagement and deceit 
in the running of the theater and in their personal and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly claimed that she had supported Seymour and the Gnu with her earnings as 
a waitress and actress between December, 1984, and January, 1989, and that she 
and Seymour had an "oral agreement" to be "50/50 partners" in a theater that 
would "showcase their individual talents." They also shared the house they 
rented next door to the theater. But last year, contended Reilly, Seymour 
arbitrarily ended their professional as well as their personal relationship, 
ousting her from her responsibilities at the Gnu. She also accused Seymour of 
using Gnu funds for his personal needs, and she requested the dissolution of 
Gnu Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Because Reilly named the state attorney general's office as one of the 
defendants, in its role as watchdog of nonprofit corporations, Patricia 
Barbosa, deputy attorney general, investigated Reilly's charges. In an opinion 
submitted to the court on April 6, Barbosa noted that nonprofit "public 
benefit" corporations "cannot form the basis of a partnership agreement." But 
she concurred with Reilly's request for an accounting of Gnu Productions, Inc. 
and with her request to remove Seymour as a director of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Barbosa said there were indications of "some serious 
violations of the Corporations Code" at the Gnu. "The books were not kept 
properly," she said. "We couldn't complete the audit." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he has resigned from the theater's board. And he acknowledged that 
"in the early days of the theater, I didn't have a (personal) checking account 
and I would write a check to my dentist from the Gnu Productions account. Later 
I found out you don't do that. For two years I haven't done that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Seymour said that over the years, "I've put in more money than I've 
taken back." He called most of Reilly's charges "the ravings of an ex," and he 
denied virtually all of them in his official written response to her suit, also 
filed in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
OH! CANCELLATION! The touring production of "Oh! Calcutta! has canceled its 
scheduled engagement at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, April 29-May 6. A 
spokesman for the show noted that this engagement was longer than most of the 
stops on the tour, and "the tickets weren't selling as they expected them to." 
Refunds are available at point of purchase.

GURNEY'S 'COCKTAIL HOUR' IS SOBER SLICE OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A.R. Gurney may be the closest thing America has to Britain's Alan Ayckbourn. 
One doesn't laugh quite as loud or as hard at Gurney's plays, draped as they 
are over a rigid New England frame, but both men have a sense of life's 
geometry that they love to translate into theater. 
</P>
<P>
Take Gurney's "The Cocktail Hour," which opened Wednesday at the James A. 
Doolittle Theatre. This is a mirror play about a son's visit home to get 
permission from his father to put on a play that he has written about that 
father and the rest of the family. Simple. 
</P>
<P>
Except that you soon realize that the play you're watching cuts close to the 
play in question. And we soon know precisely why the son's request unleashes 
such strong reaction in the parents. It is art imitating art imitating life. 
</P>
<P>
Pure geometry. Gurney's earlier "The Dining Room" is a play about a room and 
the generations of people passing through it, acting out their pent up little 
dramas. More geometry. Gurney's "Love Letters," which opened Tuesday at the 
Canon Theatre, presented parallel lives connected by words crossing the literal 
and philosophical miles dividing the writers. Again, geometry. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney's territory here as ever, is WASP land -- the affluent White Anglo-Saxon 
Protestant fiefdom of repressed emotions, stiff upper lips and churning 
stomachs in which he grew up. Central to "The Cocktail Hour" is the cocktail 
hour -- the sacred real one (which "took the place of evening prayers") and the 
play of the same title that son John has written (encore geometry). Gurney has 
gone to the altar this time: the daily ritual of an aging, rigidly conservative 
upper-middle class, in this case at odds with a progeny wanting to break free. 
</P>
<P>
Elder son John (Bruce Davison), a publishing executive who is visiting for the 
weekend to secure permission to put on his infamous play, tangles lightly with 
his parents -- Bradley (Keene Curtis) and Ann (Nancy Marchand). It is done 
drink in hand, in a welter of genteel conversation behind a veneer of good 
manners, and interrupted only by the casual visit of John's younger sister, 
Nina (Holland Taylor), who lives in this same Upstate New York town. 
</P>
<P>
But things quickly get as heated in the living room as they do in the kitchen, 
where the new maid is burning dinner. This inordinately extends the cocktail 
hour, loosing tempers to speak more truth from behind diminished defenses. 
</P>
<P>
It's soon clear that John has never felt valued by a father who's always liked 
his younger brother best; that Bradley takes a dim view of John's efforts in 
general, but his playwriting ones in particular; that Ann wishes John would 
write books instead of plays ("books are quieter"), and that the terminally 
bored Nina, who yearns to go to Cleveland to work with seeing-eye dogs, is 
furious at having only a minor role in John's play when she has such a major 
one in her parents' lives. 
</P>
<P>
By the second act, disruption is complete. Confrontations abound, facades 
crumble, confessions bubble up and all that WASP hypocrisy is cathartically 
unmasked. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cocktail Hour" at the Doolittle is the very one that originated in June, 
1988, at the San Diego Old Globe, traveling from there to a lengthy and 
respectable run at New York's Promenade before returning to Southern 
California. It takes place in Steven Rubin's same stylish New England interior, 
dotted with elegant 18th and 19th century pieces, and benefits from Globe 
artistic director Jack O'Brien's finely tuned direction. 
</P>
<P>
We're in luck that the cast too is the same, having merely refined what had 
been splendidly synchronized performances from the start: Davison as a mass of 
controlled frustrations prime for Act II's provocations and explosions; Curtis 
as a model of smug and mildly distracted self-satisfaction; Marchand as the 
sly, unruffled Ann, who's a lot savvier than she lets on -- and Taylor's 
scattered, mildly desperate Nina who finds Big Brother a savior in the end. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue sparkles, the zingers fly and Gurney finds ways to cleverly take 
on a variety of tantalizing subjects -- the antediluvian state of theater, the 
anachronistic absurdity of writing plays (which he compares to carving a corner 
of a Gothic cathedral in a computer society) and, of course, the mysterious 
critics ("Who are these people anyway?"). 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, this is top drawer drawing-room comedy and social commentary that 
never quite makes the leap to Major Play. But this writer, who had reviewed the 
original at the Old Globe almost 2 years ago, found a lot more to relish this 
time around -- perhaps because the performances have become so expert. It is 
witty, literate entertainment for lovers of the well-made, linear play.

SQUAD CRANKS WITH DELIGHTFUL, WILD ABANDON

Perhaps all of us are haunted by those shows that got away, legendary one-time 
events that occurred while we were somewhere else. While others worry about 
missing Springsteen in a biker bar or Peter Gabriel at the Bear, for well over 
a decade this writer has been irked about missing an Orange County group called 
Gumby at Costa Mesa's killed-in-action Cuckoo's Nest. 
</P>
<P>
According to those who were there, Gumby's performance was a fearless merger of 
art and utter ineptitude: Over the sort of pure dissonance that only the 
unschooled can create, the group's singer reportedly spent one song flailing 
about, clutching his forehead and pathetically repeating, "Mom, I hurt my 
head!" as catsup oozed from his hair. For a finale, the band hurled partially 
eaten sandwiches into the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning rarely strikes twice, but hearing of a Pomona Valley band featuring a 
hand truck as a percussion instrument, a vocalist who sometimes sings through a 
sad panda mask, and such lyrical expressions as "I keep bonking my head. . . . 
Oooo, ow, that hurts," one had reason to hope. 
</P>
<P>
Performing at Club Tangent on Wednesday night, Desperation Squad may not quite 
have competed with the mists of time and opportunity lost, but it proved to be 
a unique and amusing outfit. In the 11-song set, the Squad's sound seemed to be 
part Pere Ubu, part early Kinks and one part cleansing cream. 
</P>
<P>
The six Squad members actually had a fairly sharp musical expertise, but didn't 
let it get in their way. Instead, they whacked away at their songs with an 
abandon well suited to the moves of their frenetically kinetic lead singer Mr. 
P., who looked to be running at about the same bruise-to-skin ratio as the 
early Iggy Pop. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the set with Pere Ubu's "Street Waves" and followed with originals 
(most from their "Hot Diggity Dogs!" album, produced by David Lindley guitarist 
Ray Woodbury) that mixed a raw melodicism with a powerful sound best likened to 
a toxic-laden locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
"Serious Love" twinned biting guitar hooks from guitarists Jeff Hayes and Bob 
Jones around a lyric where Mr. P asked: "Why would I drive my car through a 
brick wall,/And pound the steering wheel many times onto my face? It must be 
serious love." 
</P>
<P>
Problems with love and automobiles were central to several of the songs. The 
yearning for automobility in "I Need a Girl (With a Car)" -- on which 
percussionist Becky Hamm appropriately played a hubcap -- was offset by "I Died 
(in a Car)." On the latter tune, Mr. P careened about the stage under a sheet, 
and his vocal imparted some of the indignation one might feel after such an 
abrupt and terminal change in lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Girls who like thugs was the topic of "She Don't Love Me (I'm Not a Criminal)," 
while "Mr. Fireworks" offered a hilarious glimpse into the mind of a 
dance-floor egotist. It also was the band's musical high point, kicking with 
the intensity of the Kinks' "I'm Not Like Everybody Else." The pathetic panda 
mask made an appearance late in the set, looking all-the-more deranged with Mr. 
P's long hair flying out of its mouth as he flailed about the stage. 
</P>
<P>
While reportedly something of a sensation on its home turf, the band pulled in 
few O.C. listeners Wednesday. The low attendance, coupled with the venue's odd 
policy of leaving the house lights on during performances, may have lessoned 
the band's impact.

HOME TECH / VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW : 'CHRISTINA' (WITH GARBO) RELEASED

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Greta Garbo, who died Sunday at the age of 84, had one of her most remarkable 
roles in "Queen Christina," which MGM/UA coincidentally released on 
videocassette Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In this beautifully directed (by Rouben Mamoulian) historical drama from 1933, 
Garbo was perfectly cast as the 17th-Century Swedish queen, who rebelled 
against what was expected of her in terms of both her royal and her marital 
duties. Don't miss it -- especially the exquisite, daring scene set in the 
bedroom of an inn. 
</P>
<P>
(One interesting note: Garbo insisted that her former lover, John Gilbert, be 
given the important part of the Spanish ambassador, even though his career was 
on the skids.) 
</P>
<P>
"Queen Christina" is one of eight vintage films that MGM/UA released this week 
under the blanket title "Leading Ladies Volume II." Priced at $29.95, these 
include one other Garbo picture -- the one in which she was most miscast, 
"Two-Faced Woman" (1941), a weak screwball comedy that sadly proved to be the 
actress' last cinematic appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the "Leading Ladies" package consists of top-notch comedies, dramas 
and musicals from the golden age of Hollywood -- "Marie Antoinette" (1938) 
starring Norma Shearer, "Libeled Lady" (1936) with Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy, 
Jean Harlow and William Powell, "Show Boat" (1936) with Irene Dunne, Helen 
Morgan and Paul Robeson, and "Strange Cargo" (1940) with Clark Gable and Joan 
Crawford -- plus, from later decades, "A Child Is Waiting" (1962) starring Judy 
Garland, and "Torch Song" (1953) with Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to films that had 1989 theatrical runs: 
</P>
<P>
"Sea of Love" (MCA, priced for rental, R) gave Al Pacino his first hit film in 
years. He's a New York City cop who gets involved with a serial-killing suspect 
(Ellen Barkin). 
</P>
<P>
"Black Rain" (Paramount, priced for rental, R) follows two more U.S. policemen 
(Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia) to Japan, where they take an accused assassin. 
When he escapes, they're drawn into the dark world of Japanese gangs. 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter (and more obscure) note, "Trust Me" (MCEG, $79.95, R) is a brash 
satire on the art world, starring singer Adam Ant as an opportunistic dealer. 
Ant is strong and sassy in the role, and the film is fun for a while, but 
eventually gets lost and silly. It's worth checking out, though. 
</P>

RITZ-CARLTON DINING ROOM HAS GREAT SERVICE, BUT THE FOOD IS HIT OR MISS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I wouldn't hesitate to call the dining room at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel 
the most beautiful in Orange County. It's a magnificent French provincial 
salon, resplendent with beveled mirrors, crystal chandeliers, tranquil 
impressionist paintings and the warm glow of elegance. 
</P>
<P>
In a room like this you expect great service. And you get it. The maitre d' 
never forgets a face, the sommelier is knowledgeable and the staff is 
efficient. From amuse-gueule to petit four, a dinner in this dining room is a 
meticulous experience. 
</P>
<P>
On a few occasions, I have left this hotel feeling so pampered, it didn't occur 
to me until much later that I had not particularly enjoyed my meal. 
</P>
<P>
The problem? Consistency. Recently, longtime chef Joao de Souza left his 
position here to become executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton's new Sydney 
operation. In his place here is 29-year-old Fabrice Canelle, a native of Paris 
who honed his skills at Ambria in Chicago. Canelle is a modernist, a visual 
stylist with little regard for classic preparations. Instead of sticking to the 
tried and true, he has completely reworked the menu. 
</P>
<P>
His food is bound to be controversial, especially in this most stately dining 
room. It tries hard to be California, but it's also French with hints of the 
Middle East and the South Seas. It is food that probably will take a lot of 
people by surprise. Though it sometimes is overly sweet, much of it is very 
good. A good deal more of it is not, floating somewhere between art and 
artifice. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma duck foie gras is an example of what works for him, even if the dish is 
a little busy, consisting of a buttery, rich piece of duck liver in a filo 
crust with red cabbage and cubed apple. 
</P>
<P>
Steamed Maine lobster in a vanilla vermouth sauce is an example of what doesn't 
work. Big, seductive pieces of shelled lobster meat, claws and all, are 
garnished with a black fettuccine and a yam puree. The yam and vanilla make the 
dish so sweet that the natural essence of the lobster is totally eclipsed. At 
$42, this could be the world's most expensive dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Canelle's appetizers are beautifully crafted, but the tastes just don't 
transport you. Crayfish and marinated zucchini make up one of the most 
appetizing dishes I have ever seen, with a whole school of crayfish crowded 
together atop a colorful mold of marinated vegetables. But the end result is 
rather bland. Charred sea scallops are delicious and cooked perfectly, but the 
crispy potato bed under them is merely a distraction, and the yellow pepper 
vinaigrette alongside an error in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
I loved one of the salads, mesclun with a warm goat cheese dressing and an herb 
pesto. I thought the combination was brilliant, and the dressing one of the 
best I have ever eaten. The other, mache with roasted peppers and a sherry 
vinaigrette, is a solid alternative. 
</P>
<P>
For a dining room of this stature, this is an astonishingly small menu. There 
are only 10 entrees in all, and not a single chicken dish. My choice would be 
the roasted lamb tenderloin -- noisettes of lamb swirled around a melange of 
spinach and mushroom with the ethereal essences of tomato and thyme. It is the 
most subtle dish I tasted in this dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Sauteed veal entrecote with a confit of Belgian endive in a port wine reduction 
with porcini well might have been its equal, but it came out scandalously 
overcooked and could not be properly appreciated. Air-dried roasted duck -- 
succulent, crispy and meaty -- suffered from a sticky sweet honey ginger sauce 
and a cherry-almond couscous. A waste of excellent duck. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, there are impeccable desserts. Honey-lime parfait is one, a 
creamy, frozen confection with caramelized walnuts and ginger cookies. 
Something called pistachio marjolaine is just wonderful, three tiers of grainy 
pistachio cookies with fresh raspberries and mascarpone between the cracks. And 
then there are souffles, light, airy and frothy with the whites of eggs, 
probably the chef's most classical preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room at the Ritz-Carlton is very expensive. Cold appetizers are 
$11.50 to $80 (for one ounce of Malassol caviar). Hot appetizers are $11.50 to 
$22. Fish and seafoods are $28 to $42. Meat and poultry are $28 to $34. 
Desserts are $6.50 to $9.

Albanian leader Ramiz Alia has dropped decades of opposition to diplomatic ties 
with Moscow and Washington in a major break with the isolationist past of 
Europe's last orthodox Communist state. But Alia made clear that Albania will 
not follow other East European countries in abandoning one-party Communist 
rule. Addressing the ruling party Central Committee in Tirana, the state and 
party leader said Albania had never had a phobia toward the two superpowers and 
that the renewal of ties is now on the agenda.

The House of Commons approved a controversial bill to give British passports 
and citizenship to an estimated 225,000 residents of Hong Kong. The bill would 
give right of residency to 50,000 heads of households and their families before 
Hong Kong is handed over to China in 1997. About 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese 
now hold a special category of British passport that does not confer right of 
residency in Britain.

Americans will pay $127 billion less in taxes than they owe in 1992, and the 
IRS will be able to recover only about 25% of that amount, Internal Revenue 
Service chief Fred T. Goldberg Jr. said in Washington. The gap for 1988 is 
estimated at $96.8 billion, and it is expected to grow annually. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said that much of the shortfall stems from honest error rather than 
cheating. He urged Congress to provide funds to enable the IRS to reduce the 
tax loss by, among other steps, modernizing its computers and improving 
taxpayer services. In 1987, the latest year for which figures are available, 
the net gap between what was owed and what was paid was $72 billion, Goldberg 
said.

SOVIETS STEP UP ECONOMIC WAR ON LITHUANIA

VILNIUS, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union escalated its economic warfare against Lithuania on Thursday, 
sharply curtailing crucial natural gas supplies, and a Soviet spokesman warned 
that further sanctions might be imposed in an effort to pressure the republic 
into renouncing its independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian government said the republic has only two weeks' worth of energy 
supplies. It said it is imposing strict gasoline rationing today and will 
announce other rationing measures in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything for only two goals, freedom and Lithuania," President 
Vytautas Landsbergis said in explaining the need for rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Algirdas Brazauskas, deputy prime minister, called the Moscow-imposed 
restrictions "very severe -- inhumane even." But, speaking on Lithuanian 
television, he urged his fellow countrymen to stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian leaders said they have information that further supplies to the 
republic would soon be embargoed but declined to be specific. Matuzas Saulus, 
an economic planning spokesman for Lithuania, said Moscow already is delaying 
the republic's access to its hard currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Transactions that used to take two or three days are taking up to two or three 
months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin had cut off petroleum supplies to the republic's only refinery on 
Wednesday night. On Thursday, long lines formed at Vilnius gas stations for the 
fourth straight day. Several stations were forced to close early because they 
ran out of gasoline. But many Lithuanians in the capital city seemed to adopt a 
philosophical view toward the Kremlin-ordered fuel cutoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are used to different shortages during socialist times," explained 
Virgilijius Savickas, an editor at the daily newspaper Lithuania's Morning, 
referring to persistent shortages of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. "We 
know that if we stay in the old order these shortages will continue. Our only 
chance is to break away." 
</P>
<P>
Rasa Alishauskiene, head of the Sociological Research Laboratory at Vilnius 
University, said the Moscow measures have served to help unify most of the 
population behind the government. 
</P>
<P>
"For 50 years, we were educated by the Soviets to be a collective. And now, 
ironically, the ideology is deeply ingrained. But the idea they are unifying 
around is the idea of independence," she said, basing her analysis on a 
still-unpublished poll of Lithuanian residents. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after stopping the oil supplies, Moscow reduced natural gas supplies 
into the republic by 84%, closing off three out of four natural gas pipelines 
reaching Lithuania at midday Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A telegram received in Vilnius from the Soviet Council of Ministers, the 
Cabinet, said that about 3.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day would 
still be sent to Lithuania. But Lithuanian leaders noted that the republic uses 
an average of 18 million cubic meters of natural gas daily and, in addition, 
supplies the nearby Kaliningrad region of the Russian republic. The Soviet 
Council of Ministers ordered the republic to continue supplying Kaliningrad. 
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions were imposed after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued 
an ultimatum a week ago, warning that he would halt key supplies to the 
republic unless its Parliament rescinds laws bolstering a March 11 declaration 
of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev, speaking in Moscow, said 
the Kremlin "might have some other restrictions" to impose on Lithuania but 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press, Gorbachev also met Thursday with leaders of 
the two other Baltic republics, Latvia and Estonia, both of which had announced 
their intention to reassert the independence that was snatched from all three 
republics by Soviet annexation in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
In separate meetings in the Kremlin, the Soviet president offered both 
republics "special status" in a "confederative" Soviet Union, if they stop 
trying to follow Lithuania's lead, AP quoted Baltic officials and journalists 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
But Endel Lippma, Estonia's minister for intergovernmental negotiations, said 
Gorbachev also threatened Estonia with a blockade like the one imposed on 
Lithuania. Similarly, Gorbachev told President Anatoly V. Gorbunov of Latvia 
and his delegation that he would not talk further if they declare independence 
on May 3 as planned, said Aris Yansons, Gorbunov's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The cut in Lithuania's energy supplies is likely to force some factories to 
close and, in a kind of domino effect, take a significant bite out of 
Lithuania's annual budget of about 4 billion rubles ($6.66 billion at the 
official rate), said Deputy Finance Minister Apolinaras Cepaitis. 
</P>
<P>
Profits from the republic's industries account for 12% of the budget and thus 
"we will face budget deficits in all areas," he said in an interview. But he 
vowed that Lithuania would keep a strict accounting of the cost of the economic 
sanctions and "when we finally sit down at the negotiating table, we will put 
that to the Soviet Union as a damage claim." 
</P>
<P>
Kazamieras Antanavicius, a Lithuanian lawmaker and economist, predicted that 
his fellow Lithuanians would become more desperate, once they feel their 
livelihood is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"The people will be jobless. They haven't got any savings at all and they must 
eat something. What will happen to us?" he said in an interview. "Think about 
it. If you have three kids and nothing to eat, will you panic or not?" 
</P>
<P>
He said Lithuania's efforts to buy replacement energy supplies from Western 
countries is very complicated, not only because of a shortage of foreign 
currency but because "we haven't got pipelines, we haven't got transport, we 
haven't got tankers." 
</P>
<P>
A delegation led by the republic's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, was in 
Oslo seeking support from Norwegian leaders. Norway's center-right government 
said it will not help subsidize oil sales and that it is up to oil companies to 
decide whether to sell to Lithuania. Norway's state oil firm Statoil says it is 
willing to do so but only at a market price, which the Lithuanians are unlikely 
to be able to afford.. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Brazauskas is to head an emergency committee set up to 
implement rationing plans. The Lithuanian government warned that it would 
totally cut supplies to any ministry, factory or business that violated 
rationing orders. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, gasoline is to be rationed beginning this afternoon to 7.8 
gallons per private car per month, officials announced. Energy Minister Leonas 
Asmantas said strict rationing is necessary because the republic only has 
enough energy supplies to last two weeks. Schools and hospitals, he said, would 
be the last of public buildings to face rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Many Lithuanians, like 65-year-old Nina Vorobiova, were bracing themselves for 
further economic retaliation from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day we face the same pressure, and at the end we say thank God we have 
made it," said Vorobiova, sitting at lunchtime on a bench in the city's central 
Lenin Square. "But then we have to wait for tomorrow to come." 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Golovkin is an ethnic Russian who supports Lithuania's current 
government, even though he knows that he is a minority here and that Moscow's 
response to that government may put him out of a job. "We are morally prepared" 
for economic hardship caused by the Moscow-imposed sanctions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Golovkin is the deputy director of the Vilnius Electricity Measuring Equipment 
Factory, which has a monopoly in the Soviet Union on the production of meters 
used to measure electricity usage. He argued that Moscow's measures against 
Lithuania will hurt the Soviet Union itself. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't supply raw materials to this factory, they won't have any 
meters," he said. "It's just like cutting off the branch of the tree on which 
you are sitting." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the 4,000 workers at his factory, however, agreed. Three-quarters of 
the employees are non-Lithuanians, as is 20% of the republic's population of 
3.8 million, and many complain they are being made to suffer for an 
independence declaration they do not support. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right for the Soviet Union to cut off fuel supplies," said Valentian 
Novoselskaya, drawing cheers from other assembly line workers gathered around 
her when she added that she thought Gorbachev should impose presidential rule 
in the republic.

STATE POLICY LETS POLLUTERS CERTIFY TOXIC SITES AS SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Swamped by a large and growing number of toxic dumps awaiting cleanup, the 
state Department of Health Services has adopted a policy of allowing some 
illegal toxic dumpers to clean up their own dumps -- and certify them as safe 
-- without an on-site state inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The new "self-certification" policy, set out in an internal memo obtained by 
The Times, is the latest, most controversial element in a state campaign to cut 
its toxic waste regulatory workload -- a goal environmentalists denounce as 
"outrageous" and dangerous to public health. 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes implemented in the state's toxic cleanup program in 
February is a shift from cleaning up specific dump sites as fast as possible to 
"stabilizing" such sites -- or simply stopping their poisons from spreading -- 
until the polluters themselves are coaxed into cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lesser effort than what they have been doing in the past," said a 
legislative aide familiar with the new program. "They are no longer going to 
try to clean up every site to the most pristine level possible. They're just 
going to try to stop them from getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of a wholesale march away from regulation," said Ted Smith of the 
Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition in Santa Clara County, which now leads the 
nation in the number of Superfund cleanup sites. "They've basically caved in to 
industry pressure and given up the fight to clean up these dumps." 
</P>
<P>
Lach McClenahen, chief of the health department's toxic waste cleanup section, 
countered that the policy will have the opposite effect, allowing the state to 
increase by 50% to 60% the number of dumps cleaned up each year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new process, McClenahen said, dumps will be investigated by the state 
and the site owner. Once the extent of the problem is determined, the owner 
will submit a cleanup plan. If the state approves it, the owner is obligated to 
carry it out at the owner's expense. 
</P>
<P>
State officials will monitor the owner's progress and confirm completion using 
records -- for example, auditing the invoices from hauling companies for the 
amount of tainted soils moved to an approved hazardous waste disposal facility. 
</P>
<P>
The state's goal, summarized by Deputy Health Director C. David Willis in a 
March 9 memo to Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer, is "self-certification site 
cleanup program that allows for independent RP (responsible party) cleanup 
without (state) oversight." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kizer nor Willis could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Responsible parties -- that is, the polluters -- who wish to clean up toxic 
dumps will be required to certify to the state that their efforts conform to 
state standards. But not all sites will be inspected by the state to make sure 
that the toxics have indeed been cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists criticize the program for putting too much faith in 
businesses that already have violated state regulations. The environmentalists 
question whether businesses that created the illegal dumps can turn around and 
start following state regulations when ordered to clean them up. A letter 
promising a thorough cleanup is not an acceptable substitute for having a state 
inspector on site to make sure the job gets done, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators also have expressed concerns about the new program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of an honor system, and I am not sure we're comfortable with 
that," said a staff member for the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, which 
scheduled a public hearing in May on the program after learning about it this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Although McClenahen conceded that toxic dumpers could simply lie about having 
mopped up their mess, he said his staff will be selective about which polluters 
to trust and which to inspect. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always the possibility somebody could do that (falsify a cleanup 
program)," he said. "In fact, they could do that now and we'd be none the wiser 
because we don't have people on site every day now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to turn everybody loose," McClenahen said. "Only those who 
have shown they are cooperative and responsible. People with a bad track record 
will continue in the enforcement track (with on-site inspectors)." 
</P>
<P>
McClenahen said the new policy was adopted because the Department of Health 
Services has long been criticized for not acting fast enough to clean up toxic 
dumps. 
</P>
<P>
"There's widespread disappointment that the state Superfund -- and even the 
federal Superfund -- have not done more about this problem," he said. "We are 
under constant pressure to produce more cleanups." 
</P>
<P>
With the new policy of self-policing, the state anticipates it can increase the 
number of completed toxic dump cleanups by at least 50% in 1990, to about 45 
sites from the current annual average of 30. About half those cleanups are 
major Superfund sites. There are 345 such Superfund sites in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Self-certified toxic dump cleanups is one of dozens of "new initiatives" that 
the Health Services Department has adopted this year in an attempt to cope with 
the state's growing hazardous waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other initiatives is a self-certification licensing program that 
allows hazardous waste users to obtain state licenses to handle, store and 
dispose of toxic chemicals simply by writing to the state promising to follow 
all rules. In the past, on-site state inspections were required before permits 
could be issued.

EDUCATION REMAINS SADLY SEGREGATED IN SOUTH AFRICA. WHILE 250,000 DESKS SIT 
EMPTY IN WHITE SCHOOLS, ILL-EQUIPPED BLACK SCHOOLS ARE BULGING WITH UP TO A 
MILLION TOO MANY STUDENTS.

SOWETO, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On those rare days this year when Soweto's teachers haven't been on strike or 
the pupils boycotting school, Fundi Vabaza has tried to teach business 
economics to 80 black youngsters squeezed into 30 desks in a classroom without 
an overhead projector or even a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
Here at Lamula High School, Vabaza says, "You have to bank on their 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
At the whites-only Cape Town High School, where there hasn't been a strike or a 
boycott in memory, there are videocassette players, computers, copying 
machines, laboratories and more than enough textbooks to go around this year. 
</P>
<P>
There just aren't enough students to fill all the desks. 
</P>
<P>
The result: "We're no longer able to maintain the school buses, the swimming 
pool and other facilities purchased when the school was bigger," says Nugent 
Field, the principal. 
</P>
<P>
Two typical high schools, one black and one white, supported unequally by the 
same government, tell the sad story of racially segregated education in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
And just as the black majority is being called on to join the political process 
in South Africa, an entire generation of uneducated black youngsters is 
wandering the township streets without jobs or skills. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sitting on some kind of time bomb," said Belede Mazwai, a Soweto high 
school teacher who recently quit in frustration. "Very soon, the kids are going 
to be taking over this country, and I'm frightened to think what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
While 200 white schools have closed for lack of pupils in the last decade and 
250,000 desks are still vacant, black schools are bulging with a million too 
many students. While white schools are stocked with all the teaching aids of a 
modern educational system, black schools lack the basics, from library books to 
test tubes to wall maps. 
</P>
<P>
While white schools lay off highly trained teachers for lack of students, black 
schools desperately scratch for more -- and better qualified -- teachers. About 
half the teachers in black primary schools, and one-tenth of those in high 
schools, have no high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
The government recently said it might open some white schools next year to all 
races. But its conditions, including a requirement that 90% of the parents in 
each school approve, doom that plan to failure, educators say. And even if all 
the white schools were integrated -- a move no one expects any time soon -- it 
would only begin to solve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
The report card for South Africa's educational system comes as no surprise. 
Last year, 96% of the country's white high school seniors passed their 
graduation exams. The pass rate among blacks was 42%. In Soweto, the country's 
largest black township, nine out of 10 seniors failed. 
</P>
<P>
Most black parents blame the education crisis on the government, which spends 
five times more to educate a white child than a black child. But parents also 
blame the anti-apartheid movement, which until a few weeks ago had spent 14 
years trying to change the educational system by disrupting it. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have a slogan, 'Liberation before education,' " said Thami 
Rubusana, a student activist who failed his graduation examination last year 
and is back to try again this year. "But we have begun to see you cannot 
separate education from liberation. Just because it's an apartheid education 
doesn't mean it's all rotten." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mandela's Message 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, has been 
trying to deliver that message to students since his release from prison Feb. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
More schools, more teachers and better facilities are needed, he told a recent 
political rally. But "the tactic of boycott cannot hope to win our battles," he 
added. "Our stayaways and school boycotts are giving the education department 
one long public holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has listened, however, and frustration with the educational system 
bubbled over soon after President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the lid on black 
protest in February. 
</P>
<P>
In Soweto and Alexandra townships, for example, 6,000 teachers organized by an 
ANC-aligned union staged a "chalks-down" that had the wide support of student 
activists. For four weeks, teachers went to school every day but refused to 
lift a piece of chalk to the blackboard in protest over low wages, heavy 
schedules and textbook shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers have been silenced by the government for a very long time," said 
Curtis Nkondo, president of the National Education Union of South Africa, which 
represents the teachers. "Now that they have a chance of expressing themselves, 
they don't have the patience." 
</P>
<P>
Nkondo argues that education will never be politically neutral in South Africa 
because the government uses it to dominate blacks, and the anti-apartheid 
movement now is using it to fight domination. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make use of our weapons," Nkondo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soweto teachers strike was suspended Wednesday with a government promise to 
try to meet their demands for salary increases and for more teachers. But the 
strike, pupil boycotts and impromptu holidays such as Mandela's release from 
prison already had taken a toll. Of 64 school days on the calendar since 
January, school has been in session for only four. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that it is beginning to improve black schooling and it 
has set aside $100 million to build black schools this year. But education 
experts say South Africa would need to open 300 new schools every year to keep 
up with the growing black student population and triple its annual school 
budget to give blacks and whites an equal education. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still a hell of a job to be done," acknowledged Stoffel van der 
Merwe, the government official who oversees black education. 
</P>
<P>
Lamula High School, where Vabaza teaches, sits in the middle of Soweto, a 
township of 2.5 million people and 280 public schools. For years the heart of 
black activism has beat strongest in this hometown of such famous nationalist 
leaders as Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that tens of thousands of students took to the streets on June 16, 
1976, to protest the government insistence that arithmetic and social studies 
be taught in Afrikaans, the language of the Dutch-descended white settlers. 
</P>
<P>
The government backed down on Afrikaans, but not before dozens of protesting 
children were killed by police bullets in roiling South African townships, and 
the students' struggle against apartheid education was born. 
</P>
<P>
"All the battles today are being fought by the children, because they say the 
adults are becoming too cautious," said Wilkie Khambule, who resigned as 
principal of Orlando High School in Soweto in 1976 to protest the police 
action. "The child of yesteryear accepted that the white person had the 
advantage. But the present child doesn't see why the white child has an 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Khambule, now principal of Pace Community College, admires the student 
activism, but he laments "the tremendous waste of human resources." 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my students that if they use the present circumstances as excuses not 
to study, they are going to be sorry," Khambule said. "If there is any change 
in the country, they won't be able to sit at the table because they won't be 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Dube, an 18-year-old Soweto student leader, says he and his fellow 
students are prepared to "sacrifice our education for the sake of the country. 
If we don't push, history won't forgive us." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the authorities declared Lamula High School's drab, 
prefabricated classrooms uninhabitable. Doors had been stolen from their hinges 
and holes punched through the walls. The 1,400 students were forced into three 
primary school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
One blackboard in the deserted high school still carries the chalked markings 
of an algebra problem. The classroom graffiti celebrate both black militancy 
and black hope. In small, penciled letters on one wall is the saying: "I know 
I'm somebody cos God makes no junk." 
</P>
<P>
The conditions for Lamula High's pupils and teachers did not change much with 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seated Five to a Desk 
</P>
<P>
Vabaza's class in Xhosa, an African language, has 101 students, seated five to 
a desk. There are no laboratory facilities, only a handful of textbooks and no 
books in the library. Assigning homework without books is impossible, she said, 
and because there is no mimeograph machine, her classes spend hours copying 
passages of the book from the blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of education we are giving kids now is useless," Vabaza said. "It's 
just the same as no teaching at all. But you always feel guilty when students 
fail." 
</P>
<P>
Of 100 Lamula students who took the high school graduation exam last year, only 
12 passed and only four of those scored high enough to qualify for university 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Although students may be failing the course work, many have quickly learned 
that mass action is a potent way to get what they want in school. Black 
students today are increasingly dictating when and what they will learn, and 
principals and teachers who refuse to knuckle under to "people's education" 
have been driven out. 
</P>
<P>
"Students are exposed to politics, and if you as a teacher try to turn a blind 
eye to that, it creates a lot of problems," said Mary Selebogo, another Soweto 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In that and myriad other ways, white schools bear little resemblance to black 
schools in South Africa. White schools are run by parents' boards, and student 
power never extends beyond the purely advisory role of the student council. 
</P>
<P>
Cape Town High School, a short walk from the offices of Parliament, is not 
among the richest white schools in the country. Nevertheless, the contrast with 
most black schools is readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
The freshly painted white building with its red tile roof and hardwood floors 
has an intercom system for the principal's daily announcements, a full library, 
a home economics classroom with ovens and stoves, science laboratories stocked 
with glassware, and acres of neatly clipped sports fields. Students dressed in 
the school's green and white colors all carry shoulder bags stuffed with books. 
Dates and sports and even homework, not politics, are the favored topics of 
hallway conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, one never reaches perfection," said Field, the principal. "But I 
think the standard of education is very high here, and we have a lot to be 
happy for." 
</P>
<P>
Field's biggest worry is enrollment. Four years ago he had 600 pupils in the 
school's five grades. Today that figure is 300. At least four of the nearest 
white schools face similar problems resulting from emigration, low birthrates 
and the growing popularity of private schools among whites. 
</P>
<P>
No class at Cape Town High has more than 30 students, and some are as small as 
four. Ten teachers have left and have not been replaced, the school dropped its 
rugby team for lack of players and it is phasing out two subjects -- Xhosa and 
business economics. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer students means less money for the parents' board to spend. Although the 
government pays for teacher salaries and books, white schools in South Africa 
raise money from extra student fees and parent-teacher associations to maintain 
their swimming pools, school buses and sports grounds. At Cape Town High, each 
student pays about $30 each term. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Cape Town High to all races would help solve the enrollment problem and 
many parents and students support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I get my education, that's all that matters to me," said Darryn 
Havenga, 15. Many parents agree, although they also are concerned "that 
standards be maintained," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now Private Schools 
</P>
<P>
Several white schools have rescued themselves by becoming private schools, 
which allows them to open their doors to blacks, Indians and people of mixed 
race. But in the process the schools lose substantial state subsidies, and the 
students must pay thousands of dollars in tuition. 
</P>
<P>
The government recently suggested that some white schools could become 
multiracial beginning next year if 90% of the school's parents agree. Cape Town 
High is one of 20 schools that wants to become "open," but no one knows if it 
can muster the approval of that many parents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of apartheid, first set out 
the government philosophy behind black education when he created a central 
government department in charge of "Bantu education," taking away all the 
autonomy black schools had enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Under that new system, Verwoerd said, "Natives (blacks) will be taught from 
childhood that equality with Europeans (whites) is not for them." 
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe, the current white minister of black education, says the 
government has abandoned those old policies and is trying to upgrade black 
education. But he believes that segregated schools still are best for South 
Africa because of the differing "cultural needs" of blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, with the "huge differential between white and black 
education, if we immediately integrated everything it would create tremendous 
chaos."

MANDATORY INSURANCE FOR QUAKES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian unveiled a bold earthquake insurance proposal Thursday 
that would require 90% of California homeowners to buy policies covering 
$15,000 in damage to their homes and personal property in a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
The program, the first of its kind in the nation, would be run jointly by 
private insurance companies and the state. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers would collect the premiums -- an average of $36 per year -- as a 
surcharge above their normal rates, and then turn the money over to the state, 
which would invest it in a trust fund intended to be used solely to cover the 
cost of repairing earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who desire more extensive coverage still would be able to buy 
standard earthquake insurance, which typically includes a deductible of 10% of 
the home's value or the policy's coverage limit. 
</P>
<P>
The program would be mandatory in 40 of the state's 58 counties, covering an 
estimated 6.2 million homes, including all those in Southern California, the 
Bay Area and in other earthquake-prone areas. The coverage also would apply to 
renters who insure the contents of their homes or apartments. 
</P>
<P>
From 20% to 25% of Californians now have earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles news conference, Deukmejian said buying earthquake insurance 
is a "wise and prudent" thing for homeowners to do, but he lamented that too 
few Californians purchase the coverage because of the high deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
He said many quake victims have found that, after paying hundreds or thousands 
of dollars in premiums, they got no benefits because their repair bills did not 
exceed the deductible. No insurance product is on the private market comparable 
to what Deukmejian is proposing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that this basic mandatory coverage will encourage Californians 
to insure against more catastrophic losses, because the benefits from our plan 
can be used to cover the large deductibles which are often required under 
conventional earthquake coverage," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is intended to pay for a homeowner's first $15,000 in damage from a 
quake, less a deductible ranging from $1,000 to $2,500. But there is a catch. 
If a major quake hit in the first years after the program was enacted, the 
state might not have sufficient reserves on hand to pay for the damage. In that 
case, each resident would receive a smaller, pro-rated share of the pot until 
the money was exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's plan received a lukewarm reaction from skeptical insurance 
industry representatives Thursday but was embraced warmly by a pair of 
lawmakers, a Democrat and a Republican, who specialize in insurance issues. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Levy, general manager of the Assn. of California Insurance Cos., 
described the proposal as "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in it at the moment that would lead us to oppose it," Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Levy questioned whether the fund would grow as fast as the governor 
projected and be large enough to cover the losses in a major quake. He said he 
suspected that the low deductibles proposed by the governor might lead to a 
rash of claims from even a relatively minor earthquake, bleeding the fund of 
its reserves before a truly catastrophic quake hit the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to know how many additional claims this would generate for 
what many would consider to be cosmetic damage, like cracks in walls or 
Sheetrock," he said. "You get a lot of cracks in an earthquake. How you fix 
them can be very cheap or very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
The industry prefers a national earthquake insurance program modeled after the 
federal flood insurance system. Even if the Legislature enacts the governor's 
plan, California insurers still would be liable for damage under private 
earthquake policies and court rulings obligating them in certain other 
circumstances. Their liability could reach $50 billion in a huge quake in an 
urban area. Costs of that magnitude would be expected to bankrupt some 
companies and cripple the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hart, an analyst for the insurers association, said the industry fears that 
the governor's plan might give the public a false sense of security. "We are 
concerned that in traveling down this road the impression is going to be 
created that this solves the earthquake damage claims problem," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
But Republican state Sen. Frank Hill of Whittier, who will introduce 
legislation to enact the governor's plan, described the proposal as "an 
aggressive step" that solves a large part of the problem even if it is not "the 
whole solution." 
</P>
<P>
"The basic question is what do you do when a chimney falls through the roof and 
you have $8,000 or $10,000 or $12,000 worth of damage?" Hill said. "History 
suggests that this represents the overwhelming majority of the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assemblyman Patrick Johnston of Stockton, chairman of the Assembly 
Finance and Insurance Committee, described the proposal as a "very positive 
development" and said he could see no major flaw that would hinder its passage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration has moved forcefully to solve a major part of the 
earthquake insurance problem," said Johnston, who has been sharply critical of 
Deukmejian on other insurance issues. "For the vast majority of homeowners at 
risk in California, this proposal appears to me to be the right solution at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, homeowners would be assessed between $12 and $60 a year for the 
coverage, with the level of the premium depending on the type of structure and 
its proximity to an active earthquake fault. The deductibles would range from 
$1,000 to $2,500, based on the value of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said the fund was designed to collect about $220 million in the 
first year and build to between $4 billion and $5 billion after 10 years if 
there were no losses. 
</P>
<P>
Under that scenario, the state fund quickly would be sufficient to cope with a 
repeat of the Oct. 17 Bay Area quake, according to John Sullivan, deputy 
secretary for the state Business Transportation and Housing Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said 24,000 homes were damaged in that earthquake, with the 
Administration estimating that the average damage was $8,000. A repeat of that 
quake's toll would cost the fund about $192 million, he said.

AWARD AGAINST ACLU LAWYER WILL STAND

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday let stand a precedent-setting, $46,000 
damage award against a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer for 
violating the rights of a policeman he ejected from a public meeting on police 
surveillance practices. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a brief order, refused to hear a challenge by the attorney to 
a state Court of Appeal decision last December that concluded the Newport Beach 
officer's removal from an ACLU-sponsored conference in the Orange County city 
was discriminatory under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for attorney Rees Lloyd had vigorously defended the ejection of Officer 
Richard T. Long, saying the right of free association allowed conference 
organizers to turn away someone they believed was an undercover "government 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
The case marked the first time the ACLU -- the longtime champion of individual 
rights -- or one of its lawyers has been held liable for infringing on the 
rights of others. The ACLU itself earlier paid Long $35,000 in settlement of 
its portion of his claim. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action allows the appellate decision to become binding on trial 
courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh R. Manes of Los Angeles, an attorney for Lloyd, called the action 
"incredible" and pledged to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. "I am absolutely 
stunned," said Manes. "This case has many free-speech implications -- not the 
least of which is the right to throw out a police officer who is spying on you 
at a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey M. Epstein, a Los Angeles lawyer representing the officer, welcomed the 
high-court action, saying it established an important judicial precedent 
protecting the right of government employees to sue for discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I find this case extremely ironic," Epstein said. "I don't have any great 
dislike for the ACLU, but if they do something wrong they should be made to pay 
for their mistakes just like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Long, a sergeant and head of the department's robbery-homicide detail, said the 
decision vindicated him from accusations that he was spying at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased that the courts saw fit not to forget my civil rights as an 
individual and as a police officer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1980 when the ACLU organized a conference on police 
practices, advertising the meeting as open to the public and inviting the local 
police chief, who did not attend. Long, then a community relations officer, 
went to the meeting dressed in civilian clothes, paid an admission fee, put on 
a name tag and took a seat at a seminar on police surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
The officer made written notes and, apparently surreptitiously, tape-recorded 
the proceedings. Conference organizers spotted him and one of the speakers, 
Linda Valentino of the Friends Service Committee, announced his presence. 
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, Lloyd, then an ACLU staff attorney, demanded that 
Long identify himself -- which Long did. Lloyd then said: "I want you outside. 
I'd like to discuss some of the principles of the ACLU with you." Lloyd 
allegedly pointed a finger in the officer's face, again ordered him out of the 
meeting and then threatened to slap him. Long rose to tell the audience he was 
not there to spy but to improve community relations and then left the room. 
</P>
<P>
The officer brought suit against the ACLU, Lloyd and Valentino, seeking damages 
for unlawful discrimination and infliction of emotional distress. An Orange 
County Superior Court jury in 1987 awarded Long $4,600 from Valentino, $46,000 
from Lloyd and $20,000 from the ACLU -- with a judge later holding the ACLU 
liable for $72,000 in legal fees for Long. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after the ACLU reached a settlement with the officer, a state Court of 
Appeal in Santa Ana upheld the award against Lloyd but by a vote of 2 to 1 
overturned the award against Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court rejected Lloyd's contention that the words he used in the 
confrontation with Long represented constitutionally protected free speech. The 
Unruh Act can be violated by words alone, the court noted. "If the speech is 
meant to, and does, offend the law, utterance of the words themselves may be 
protected; but the speaker is subject to the consequences," Appellate Justice 
Thomas F. Crosby wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also turned down the lawyer's claim that officers are not protected 
by the Unruh Act when they attend public meetings to gather information about 
groups or individuals. The jury could properly conclude that Long was the 
victim of discrimination because of his occupation, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
"Police officers as individuals have rights, too, and can bring actions for 
violations of those rights even though their injury has arisen in some way 
related to performance of their duties," Crosby said. 
</P>
<P>
In their subsequent appeal to the state Supreme Court, Lloyd's lawyers argued 
that political groups were entitled to exclude what they reasonably perceived 
as an "illegal governmental presence." The ACLU's policy, they said, was that 
police monitoring of lawful public meetings violated the First Amendment. 
Permitting suits for ejecting police, they said, would have a "chilling effect" 
on free speech and association.

RESCINDING OF CAL STATE RAISES URGED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SYSTEM CHANCELLOR W. ANN REYNOLDS APOLOGIZES FOR HER HANDLING OF THE 
MATTER.

<P>
A committee of California State University trustees on Thursday recommended 
rescinding large and controversial raises given in January to 27 top 
administrators but did not call for the firing of system Chancellor W. Ann 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
However, Reynolds' hold on her job won't be certain until the full Board of 
Trustees meets today. 
</P>
<P>
Headed by Trustee J. Gary Shansby, the special committee on the raises met 
Thursday at the Oakland Airport Hilton Hotel. In unusually strong language, 
panel members sharply criticized Reynolds and her staff for their secretive 
handling of raises, which has caused an uproar among faculty and legislators. 
During the tense hearing Thursday, Reynolds apologized. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member committee unanimously called for an immediate suspension of the 
raises, which ranged between 21% and 43% and upped Reynolds' pay from $136,248 
last year to $195,000. Instead, the panel recommended temporary cost-of-living 
increases of less than 5% and also called for further study of the issues. The 
full Board of Trustees appears likely to adopt those proposals today. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee William D. Campbell was the most aggressive in grilling Reynolds and 
her staff Thursday. Campbell focused on why Reynolds, in pushing for 
closed-door discussions of the raises last fall, seemed to break a 1984 promise 
to legislators that any such debate would be open. 
</P>
<P>
"We look stupid and I hate that," said Campbell, visibly angry that he had not 
known about such a promise until last month. "I feel embarrassed as a trustee." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said she had forgotten about that pledge. "I have indicated my most 
sober apology," said the chancellor, who has headed the university since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Reynolds said she agreed with the salary rollback. She 
declined to comment on widespread speculation that her job is on the line 
because of the salary controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' questions, Shansby said his committee was not 
empowered to discuss the possible dismissal of any employee. Asked what might 
happen today, he replied: "Anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor and her staff contended that they wanted to avoid faculty and 
other staff unions from using top administrators' salaries as a weapon in 
contract negotiations. So, Reynolds said, it became standard practice for the 
Board of Trustees to give general guidelines for top salary increases but to 
delegate final decisions to the trustees' chairman and the chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Caesar J. Naples, Cal State vice chancellor for faculty and staff relations, 
told the committee that the initial goal was to raise salaries of the 20 campus 
presidents because their pay was falling behind national averages of comparable 
schools. Then, he said, the staff used a private consultant study of 
universities nationwide to see how much more vice chancellors and chancellors 
should earn. 
</P>
<P>
However, Shansby and other trustees complained Thursday that they were given 
only a summary of the consultant's report. In addition, they said they were 
upset that they had not known until recently that Reynolds earned, in addition 
to her Cal State salary, more than $90,000 last year by serving on corporate 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell asked Naples if he had been aware that only 68% of UC President David 
P. Gardner's salary of $230,600 came from state funds and the rest from 
donations and grants. Naples said he hadn't known that. That point is important 
because some trustees felt that Reynolds and Gardner should be paid the same, 
although all of Reynolds' salary is state-funded. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 1 pay increases pegged annual salaries of the 20 campus presidents at 
$130,000, of five vice chancellors at $145,000 and of the executive vice 
chancellor at $150,000. Meanwhile, professors' pay rose 5.7% to a top of 
$58,100. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees are under intense pressure from the Legislature to roll back the 
raises. On Wednesday, the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee on education 
said the raises should be only 4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State's general counsel, Mayer Chapman, faced particularly tough 
questioning Thursday as he insisted that open public meeting requirements had 
not been violated in the salary discussions last fall. Shansby's committee 
showed a lack of confidence in Chapman by recommending that the full board 
today appoint an independent attorney to advise them on the salary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Thursday, Cal State Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Carter 
denied that he wanted to avoid state scrutiny in the university's purchase of 
six cars, with take-home privileges, for himself and the five vice chancellors. 
Legislators are suspicious because the total price of those Ford Tauruses was 
slightly below the $100,000 ceiling that would have triggered outside review. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the trustees revoked the take-home privileges and placed the cars 
in a general auto pool. Still unresolved is how the money spent on them will be 
returned, as legislators demand, to the employees' benefits fund surplus from 
where it was taken.

KILAUEA VOLCANO DESTROYS 82ND HOME

Lava from Kilauea Volcano torched another Hawaii Island home Thursday, the 82nd 
destroyed during its current eruption, and continued moving toward other 
dwellings, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A house in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision was ignited less than 12 hours 
after another home a short distance away burned Wednesday, said Bruce Butts of 
the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The flow was moving toward another home that was about 350 feet away, Butts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a killer for the residents," Civil Defense Director Harry Kim said 
from a command post set up at a park in Kalapana, on the southeastern coast of 
the island. "It is painstakingly slow. This is real high stress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lava was coming from the north and was following the path of another flow 
that destroyed two homes on April 4. In all, the volcano has destroyed six 
homes in the Kalapana area this month. 
</P>
<P>
The latest destruction brings to 82 the number of dwellings claimed by the 
volcano since it began erupting in January, 1983.

CENSUS GEARS UP FOR HOUSE-TO-HOUSE INTERVIEWS; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: THE BUREAU IS FACING ITS MOST DAUNTING TASK. DIRECTOR TELLS CONGRESS 
$100 MILLION MORE IS NEEDED TO HANDLE THE ADDED WORKLOAD.

<P>
With a plea to Congress for more money and public assurances that it is back on 
track, the troubled 1990 Census has begun to gear up for its most daunting task 
-- going door-to-door to some 37 million households and asking residents the 
same questions they could not or would not respond to by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bryant, the director of the Census Bureau, told a panel of skeptical 
members of Congress on Thursday that the bureau will need at least $100 million 
beyond its current budget to complete the house-to-house interviewing on time. 
But she said the job can be done despite the fact that census takers must visit 
about 15 million more homes this year than they did during the last census in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go to anything that has a roof on it," Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Other census officials, in interviews here this week, acknowledged that gaining 
access to more than one-third of the nation's front doors won't be easy in a 
society where a growing number of rich people sequester themselves behind 
locked gates, where immigrant families hole up in garages and trailers and 
where soliciting information in some neighborhoods can be a life-endangering 
act. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what's going to be tougher, getting by a doorman in a Park 
Avenue apartment building or persuading a gang member in Southeast Los Angeles 
to leave you alone," said a census official who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the bureau's Jess Margarito said: "We have had meetings with 
members of the Crips and the Bloods to let them know what we are doing and to 
ask them not to disturb our people." 
</P>
<P>
When the census takers go house-to-house, beginning next week, they are likely 
to encounter hostility, apathy and a lot of empty houses, thanks to the busy 
lives of America's growing number of two-career couples, say pollsters and 
survey experts who conduct such interviews on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"They can expect a lot of doors won't be open because there's no one behind 
them," said Andy Kohut, president of Princeton Survey Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Harris, the noted New York-based pollster, said many market research 
firms have given up door-to-door work in favor of telephone interviews because 
of the expense and danger of intruding into unfamiliar neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The perils and pitfalls of trying to get 250 million Americans to answer census 
forms during one year has led some demographic experts to argue in favor of a 
system of sampling segments of the population. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the bureau has received forms back from 63% of the nearly 100 million 
homes that were supposed to receive forms in the mail. The rate of response is 
23% lower than it was in 1980 and 7% lower than the bureau had predicted. 
Bureau officials believed the response rate would be lower than 1980 because 
they suspected that the amount of unsolicited mail people now receive would 
cause many to throw out census forms without looking at them. 
</P>
<P>
However, the disappointing level of response has caused a group of Democratic 
congressmen, including Mervyn M. Dymally of Compton and Vic Fazio of 
Sacramento, to accuse census officials of jeopardizing the success of the 
census and to request President Bush to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the bureau would have received a higher return if it had 
better identified the census forms as official government documents; had better 
assembled address lists, and had not sent out the forms in early April, when 
people were preoccupied with tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
"The Census Bureau is presiding over a failure, so far," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen joined Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown in asking Bush to 
make a live statement on prime time television to draw people's attention to 
the importance of achieving a complete count of the nation's population. Nearly 
$40 billion in federal aid is distributed to local governments on the basis of 
population, age and income data supplied by the census. Moreover, 18 
congressional seats -- seven of them in California -- could be reallocated as a 
result of population changes measured by the census. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have also expressed concern about the progress of the census, 
although their statements have been considerably more tempered. 
</P>
<P>
This week, city officials in Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and New York said 
that local surveys indicated that from 10% to 19% of local residents had not 
received their census forms. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House census subcommittee Thursday, Bryant said that post 
offices had not been able to deliver 3.1 million census forms, about 500,000 
more undeliverable forms than the bureau had anticipated. But she maintained 
that there was no evidence, so far, that a disproportionate number of minority 
residents were being missed by the census. 
</P>
<P>
"In actual fact, urban counts are not lacking more than other places," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing a comparison between well-known black and white neighborhoods in New 
York City, she said that "the Harlem response rate is better than the upper 
East Side." And she said that many Latino neighborhoods "also are looking 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 64-year-old Bryant, whose manner is normally reminiscent of a 
patient if slightly put upon school principal, blamed some of the problems of 
the census on her critics. She said that the "negativity" of some city 
officials toward the bureau was "creating a very unfortunate aura" that might 
be causing some people not to participate in the census. 
</P>
<P>
In some cities, including Los Angeles, the bureau is still scrambling to hire 
enough people, especially people who can speak foreign languages, to get the 
job done. And in Los Angeles and other cities where the census mailing missed 
buildings, streets and entire zip codes, officials are asking how census takers 
now will find those households. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that we will have an accurate census," Bryant said. "The 
only thing that has changed is that our workload of personal-visit follow-up 
will be larger than originally planned."

DOLE UNDER FIRE FOR CRITICIZING SENATE RESOLUTION ON JERUSALEM

Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, already under fire for questioning the high 
level of U.S. aid to Israel, invited more criticism Thursday by bluntly telling 
his colleagues they made a "dangerous" mistake in passing a resolution 
recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Just back from a trip to the Middle East, Dole said the resolution has dismayed 
moderate Arab states and troubled even some Israeli leaders as an "ill-timed" 
intervention at a "critical" juncture in the delicate Middle East peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a written reply to criticism of his remarks by House Republican Whip 
Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other conservative Republicans, the Kansas senator 
lambasted those who "think that if you disagree with a single policy or 
practice of the Israeli government . . . you should be characterized as 
'anti-Israel.' 
</P>
<P>
"That is bunk," he said, admonishing Gingrich against joining in "the narrow 
but shrill chorus of people who take that tack." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual public exchange of sharp letters between the Republican leaders, as 
well as criticism of Dole by American Jewish groups, quickly embroiled in 
controversy the foreign aid and policy issues that Dole was seeking to raise. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange also appeared to surprise a number of his Senate colleagues who -- 
noting that Dole has been a strong supporter of Israel in the past -- said they 
could not see what he hopes to gain by taking critical positions that have 
little chance of winning wide support in Congress, especially during an 
election year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really baffled. We have no idea what he's trying to do," said a senior 
Democratic aide on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second major dispute involving Israel touched off by Dole this year. 
Last January, he caused a minor storm of protest by proposing 5% cuts in 
foreign aid to Israel and four other top recipients to make room in the crimped 
foreign aid budget for Panama, Nicaragua and the emerging democracies of 
Eastern Europe, all of which are looking for more U.S. support. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his denials, Dole at the time was widely believed to have been floating 
a trial balloon for the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration wanted to achieve more control over the $15 billion foreign 
aid budget by putting limits on earmarking, the practice by which Congress 
influences foreign policy by allocating aid funds. The so-called "big five" 
recipients -- Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan and the Philippines -- receive 
the bulk of that money. Israel, the largest single recipient, gets $3 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
While Dole's latest comments may reflect to some degree the Administration's 
frustration with a political stalemate in Israel that has frozen the peace 
process, Dole appears to be acting largely on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's acting as an independent contractor on this. I see no evidence 
that he is doing this for the Administration," said California Rep. Duncan 
Hunter (R-San Diego), one of four conservative House members who criticized 
Dole at a press conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Dole is speaking for himself. I don't agree with his position and I don't 
think many other senators do either," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), 
a member of the delegation Dole led to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Dole complained that much of the criticism directed toward him was based on 
"misquotes" and "out-of-context excerpts" of remarks attributed to him in 
Israel by a newspaper there, the Jerusalem Post. 
</P>
<P>
He denied having said he would seek to repeal the Jerusalem resolution and 
sought to draw a distinction between the status of Jerusalem itself and the 
Senate's taking a clear position on it at a delicate stage in the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Adopted by voice vote on March 22, the Senate resolution conflicts with the 
official U.S. policy of not recognizing Jerusalem as the capital as Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution declares (itself) on an issue that our government -- and many 
outside observers -- see as better left to negotiations among the parties 
involved," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main point is that the issue of Jerusalem is serious business," he added. 
"It's not 'National Silkworm Week' or 'Underwater Breathing Week.' " 
</P>
<P>
One Senate staffer said a number of lawmakers who shared Dole's frustration 
with earmarking admired his "guts" in raising such a sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
However, in tackling it with his characteristic bluntness, the minority leader 
may have put himself in the position of leading a minority of one, Senate 
staffers added. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who co-signed the letter Gingrich sent to Dole, added that the 
"perception" created by Dole's recent statements "is that the United States 
does not stand as solidly behind Israel as we have in the past."

A meeting of members of a religious party that backs Labor Party leader Shimon 
Peres' bid to form a government broke up in panic when a tear-gas canister was 
thrown at it from a nearby building, Israel Radio and television reported. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was largely attended by members of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel 
party, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Agudat holds five seats in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, and is under 
orders from its leading rabbis to support Peres. 
</P>
<P>
When Peres tried to put together a Knesset majority last week, two Agudat 
members disobeyed their leaders, leaving Peres two short of a 61-vote majority. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, one of the holdouts, Rabbi Avraham Verdiger, gave in to 
pressure from the council and reversed himself. He said he will support Peres, 
bringing the dovish Labor leader tantalizingly close to power. A vote on Peres' 
bid to become prime minister is scheduled for next week.

VATICAN RENEWS FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CZECHOSLOVAKIA

The Vatican restored full diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia on Thursday 
on the eve of a weekend visit there by a Pope journeying to celebrate new 
freedom for a Czechoslovak church that he has long supported in adversity. 
</P>
<P>
As Archbishop of Krakow in Poland, Karol Wojtyla took a special interest in the 
fate of a church systematically suppressed for four decades by a Communist 
government in Prague. Now, as Pope John Paul II, he will make a bellwether 
address in Prague on Saturday that is expected to outline papal hopes for the 
development of aspiring young democracies throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Many of East Europe's new leaders, including Czechoslovak President Vaclav 
Havel, cite John Paul's unyielding appeals for human rights as a major catalyst 
of democratic change in the region. The Pope argues that religious freedom is 
the most basic right and calls for a common European homeland united by common 
Christian principles. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous announcements here and in Prague on Thursday said that diplomatic 
ties will be resumed at full ambassadorial level but did not name the envoys to 
be exchanged. A Vatican statement hailed the end of "a sad parenthesis of these 
last 40 years" when relations were poor or nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a year ago, John Paul was deploring the "sad state" of the 
church under a government -- led by Prime Minister Milos Jakes -- that 
repressed religious rights and restricted religious instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's last envoy to Prague, by then only a figurehead, was given 72 
hours to pack his bags in 1950. In the intervening years, Czechoslovak 
governments refused to allow the Vatican to fill the posts of bishops who died. 
At one point in 1989, 10 of 13 Czech bishoprics were vacant. Appointment of new 
bishops has become routine since Czechoslovakia began its transition toward 
democracy last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's addition of Czechoslovakia to the Vatican's diplomatic list marked 
another milestone in the extension of the Holy See's links -- and influence -- 
with countries in which the church was once a principal government target. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months, ties have been resumed with the Soviet Union, Hungary 
and Poland, and renewed relations also seem in prospect with Romania, where the 
Vatican named 12 new bishops last month, restoring the church hierarchy there 
to pre-World War II levels.

'THERE ARE LIMITS' TO PATIENCE ON LITHUANIA, BUSH SAYS;

DIPLOMACY: BUT THE PRESIDENT ADDS THAT HE IS NOT READY FOR REPRISALS AGAINST 
MOSCOW.

<P>
President Bush said Thursday "there are limits" to his patience as he watches 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev try to throttle back the Lithuanian 
independence movement but that he is not ready to take action against the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
As both Soviet and Lithuanian officials said that the Kremlin is increasing its 
economic pressure against the breakaway Baltic republic, Bush undertook a new 
round of consultation with allied leaders over how the West should respond. 
</P>
<P>
He met with French President Francois Mitterrand in an afternoon-long summit 
conference on this sun-drenched island at the top of the string of Florida 
Keys. On Wednesday, he spoke by telephone with West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl. In addition, Bush's spokesman said the President will talk with other 
allied leaders in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
In a further demonstration of the quickened pace of allied consultations, 
Mitterrand said Bush has agreed to the convening of a NATO summit conference 
during 1990. And he disclosed a French agreement with West Germany to seek 
expansion of the Common Market's economic mandate to include some form of 
greater security cooperation among the members of the European Community -- a 
"confederation" that could further cement the ties of a unified Germany to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he sees no threat to U.S. interests as a result of such a 
"confederation." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the President has declined to carry out what he had said Tuesday 
would be "appropriate responses" to a cutoff of Soviet energy supplies to 
Lithuania. Asked at a 72-minute news conference after his meeting with 
Mitterrand whether there is a limit to his patience, Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are limits. And having said that, I am convinced that Mr. Gorbachev 
knows that there are limits in terms of this matter. I don't think there will 
be a misunderstanding on this point. None at all. We have been in touch, and I 
don't think there can be that big a communications gap at all." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who said he has been unable to confirm just what actions the Soviets have 
taken toward Lithuania, said the dispute "must be dealt with through dialogue 
so that the Lithuanian people's rights to self-determination can be realized." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing words used a week ago when he met in Bermuda with British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush added, "we're deeply disturbed" by Soviet 
statements and actions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he is reluctant to outline specific U.S. responses, in order to "keep 
open a dialogue and discussion that affects many, many countries. And I'm 
talking about arms control. I'm talking about solidifying the democracies in 
Eastern Europe. I'm talking about a lot of matters where U.S.-Soviet relations 
affect a lot of other countries." 
</P>
<P>
However, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said later that Bush did 
not intend to signal that the developments in Lithuania could have an impact on 
U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said that Bush, in discussing communications with Moscow, was 
referring to, among other things, a telephone conversation Wednesday between 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had invited Mitterrand to Key Largo to review the broad scope of change in 
Eastern Europe, the ever-increasing prospects for German unification and the 
proper role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as the Washington summit 
with Gorbachev, set to begin May 30, draws near. 
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting was given heightened urgency by the latest Soviet response 
to the Lithuanian independence declaration of March 11. And, while U.S. 
officials said there is no concerted U.S. effort to organize a coordinated 
Western response, there have been such attempts elsewhere. On Wednesday, French 
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas called for a coordinated initiative by the Common 
Market to focus on Moscow, but also to "impress on Lithuania the fact that 
dialogue has become more and more necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The call for such a response followed the disclosure Wednesday that the flow of 
Soviet petroleum, on which Lithuania depends, was cut off. On Thursday, Soviet 
officials said natural gas supplies were being severely curtailed and that 
further sanctions might be applied. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand spent approximately 8 1/2 hours here. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's trip to Key Largo began a four-day journey that will take him to 
fund-raising events for Republicans in Birmingham, Ala., and Orlando, Fla., 
today, and on to Florida Bay on Saturday and Sunday in search of bonefish.

THORNBURGH AIDE LINKED TO GRAY LEAK; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROBE SAYS THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN AND AN EX-FBI 
OFFICIAL CONFIRMED A DAMAGING REPORT ON HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER.

<P>
A criminal investigation by the Justice Department has concluded that the chief 
spokesman for the attorney general and a former FBI official played roles in 
confirming a politically damaging CBS report about Rep. William H. Gray III of 
Pennsylvania, one of the top Democratic leaders in the House. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation failed to establish the original source of the information, 
but said the individual probably was outside the Justice Department, sources 
close to the investigation said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS report, broadcast when Gray was running for his leadership post last 
spring, suggested that Gray's financial dealings were being investigated by 
federal officials. Democrats charged that the leak about the inquiry, which 
actually was focused on an accountant for Gray, was calculated to damage Gray's 
reputation at a time when a number of Democratic leaders were under fire. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh responded at the time by declaring that Gray himself 
was not the target of the inquiry, and by ordering an investigation into the 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday responding to a New York Times' story, Thornburgh 
defended his spokesman, David Runkel, saying he was "acting in an authorized 
manner" when he refused to deny or wave off the CBS reporter, Rita Braver, when 
she contacted him about the story. 
</P>
<P>
"He was following my standing instruction that no one in the department mislead 
the media," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources close to the investigation emphasized that it concluded that there 
was no evidence anyone on Thornburgh's staff was the original source of the 
Gray report. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation by the department's criminal division found that after 
obtaining the original information, Braver, who has declined to discuss her 
reporting on the matter, first contacted an official in the FBI, who confirmed 
some of the "core" facts. She then contacted Runkel, according to the sources, 
who believes that she outlined the facts of what she planned to report and, in 
words to the effect, asked: "Are you going to wave me off? Is this a bad 
story?" Runkel then responded no, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there are circumstances where a statement of the kind likely 
made here by Mr. Runkel may be used by a reporter as confirmation of a story," 
Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
It is common practice in Washington reporting to attempt to verify with 
official spokesmen information that a reporter has obtained from a source who 
is not an official spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said he has instructed his staff not to mislead the media. He added: 
"If . . . the media on occasion interprets the fact that we will not deny 
information or wave them off of a story as confirmation of an unauthorized 
disclosure, then that is an inevitable byproduct of our policy." Thornburgh 
made no mention of the New York Times' report that Runkel had failed a 
polygraph examination on the Gray leak. Sources familiar with the investigation 
said the matter on which Runkel "showed deception," or which was inconclusive 
during the polygraph test, did not relate to the question of who first leaked 
existence of the Gray probe. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the investigation's central finding is not likely to put an 
end to the affair, which takes on special importance because of the heavy 
emphasis Thornburgh has placed on shutting off leaks from his department. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, when the investigation was completed, Thornburgh told Sen. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that 
insufficient evidence had been developed to prosecute anyone or discipline any 
present department employee. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Biden and other Democrats on Capitol Hill, Thornburgh on 
April 3 submitted the Gray leak investigation to Michael E. Shaheen Jr., the 
department's career internal watchdog, for his "advice." 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen has completed his review and submitted a report on it to Thornburgh 
through his assistant, Murray Dickman. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be learned what position Shaheen took on the investigation or 
whether Thornburgh will submit Shaheen's advice to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen's view could be crucial, because as counsel for professional 
responsibility, his office has served as the department's conscience. He has 
criticized in official reports several previous attorneys general for their 
conduct in various matters. 
</P>
<P>
It was considered unusual that Thornburgh turned the Gray leak over to the 
criminal division rather than to Shaheen, who has conducted most of the 
department's leak probes. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Biden last Dec. 29, after the investigation was completed, 
Thornburgh said he had been told that Shaheen's office "has agreed with all of 
the criminal division's decisions regarding the investigation, as well as with 
the conclusions they reached." 
</P>
<P>
But Shaheen then said that he had not seen the report, and Biden began pressing 
for it to be turned over to him.

LAWMAKERS DEBATE AIDS INFECTION REPORTING PLAN 
</P>

<P>
A congressional hearing on legislation that would commit nearly $1.5 billion to 
the treatment of early-stage AIDS infections next year erupted Thursday into a 
debate over a proposal to require doctors to report the names of infected 
patients to health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
On opposite sides of the issue were Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), 
who supports mandatory reporting of patients infected with the AIDS virus, and 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who believes the decision should be left 
up to the states. 
</P>
<P>
"The cornerstones of public health -- confidential reporting (of the infected) 
and (sexual) contact tracing -- should be adopted in every community in 
America," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be up to the public health people (in each state) to decide whether 
(mandatory reporting) is going to contain the disease, or whether that's going 
to drive people away (from testing centers) for fear of discrimination," Waxman 
countered. 
</P>
<P>
The two lawmakers squared off during a hearing before the health and 
environment subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The 
subcommittee heard testimony on two bills written by Waxman that are likely to 
be the only major pieces of AIDS legislation considered by Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
Early treatment of those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, which 
causes AIDS, has assumed increasing importance in the last year as researchers 
have demonstrated that experimental drugs such as AZT can forestall the onset 
of the disease, perhaps for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Waxman measures would extend Medicaid coverage to pay for early treatment 
of infected patients who are poor. 
</P>
<P>
Under current policy, Medicaid covers treatment only after a patient has a 
fully developed case of AIDS. Extension of Medicaid coverage as proposed by 
Waxman could cost more than $660 million in the first year and more than $5 
billion over five years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legislation would provide $500 million a year for grants to 
agencies that offer counseling, drug treatment and other services to those 
newly infected with HIV but not yet ill, $300 million for emergency aid to 
cities with more than 2,000 AIDS patients and $60 million to continue model 
counseling and outpatient programs. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, four witnesses invited by Dannemeyer told Waxman that his 
legislation should include language denying federal funds to states that do not 
require doctors to report in confidence to public health authorities the names 
of those who have tested positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer is expected to offer an amendment to that effect. A similar effort 
in 1988 failed on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
However, other witnesses invited by Waxman, including David Wexler, chairman of 
the board of AIDS Project Los Angeles, said mandatory reporting would drive 
those most in need of AIDS testing underground because they would fear breaches 
of confidentiality and resulting discrimination.

reflects the intent of Congress by excluding women from the highest risk of 
direct combat," the service said in a statement released at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made last fall by the Defense Advisory Committee on 
Women in the Services. The panel was founded in 1951 and advises the Department 
of Defense on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We currently offer women full career opportunities and maintain equitable 
advancement in schooling and promotion selection rates," the Army statement 
said.

EPA TO REQUIRE OLDER PESTICIDES TO MEET ANTI-CANCER LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a partial victory for California environmentalists, the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will require older 
pesticides to meet the same anti-cancer standards now applied to new chemicals 
in processed food. 
</P>
<P>
However, the federal agency said it would continue to permit the use of certain 
pesticides that are known to cause cancer if they pose only a "negligible" risk 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who had joined with environmentalists and 
organized labor in suing the EPA, praised the decision as a step forward but 
criticized the agency for not banning the use of all pesticides known to cause 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to pesticides, there is no such thing as an acceptable risk," 
said Van de Kamp, who is campaigning for the Democratic nomination for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
Al Meyerhoff, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, termed 
the EPA decision a "major step forward" but said the group will continue its 
fight in court -- and on the ballot -- to eliminate the use of cancer-causing 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute revolves around a provision in federal law known as the Delaney 
Clause, which prohibits the use in processed food of additives that are known 
to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the EPA had circumvented the rule and permitted the use of dozens of 
pesticides that were initially approved but were later found to cause cancer. 
One of the most controversial such chemicals was Alar, a growth-inducing 
substance that was applied on apples and other produce until nationwide concern 
forced the EPA to ban its use. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and the Natural Resources Defense Council argue that the Delany 
Clause prohibits the use of 66 other cancer-causing pesticides. They filed both 
a lawsuit and petition last year seeking to overturn the EPA's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on cancer-causing pesticides is also incorporated in the so-called Big 
Green environmental initiative planned for the November ballot. Among other 
things, the proposed ballot measure, co-sponsored by Van de Kamp, would phase 
out the use of all known cancer-causing pesticides in California.

JUDGE REJECTS CHALLENGE TO CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge Thursday rejected a challenge to the 
opening of car-pool lanes along a 10-mile stretch of the San Diego Freeway, 
clearing the way for the long-awaited unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
With the ruling by Judge W. F. Rylaarsdam, officials at the California 
Department of Transportation announced that the northbound car-pool lane will 
open at 7 a.m. today and that the southbound strip will open early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The two new lanes, which extend from the Santa Ana Freeway to the Corona del 
Mar Freeway, connect to an existing 14-mile stretch of car-pool lanes on the 
San Diego Freeway to form the longest continuous "high-occupancy vehicle" 
network in the state, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans delayed the opening of the lanes after Drivers for Highway Safety, an 
Orange County-based organization that has clashed consistently with the agency, 
filed a lawsuit April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers for Highway Safety argued that Caltrans had failed to complete the 
required studies needed before the lanes could go into operation. The group's 
primary goal was to block the opening of the car-pool lanes in hopes of forcing 
Caltrans to allow all traffic to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the organization contend that car-pool lanes, which are restricted 
to vehicles with two or more occupants, are unsafe because during peak hours 
they put cars hurtling along at high speeds next to rows of vehicles stalled in 
heavy traffic. In addition, the group believes the lanes actually cause more 
congestion by cramming a majority of cars into fewer lanes.

A GUILTY VERDICT IS ASSURED WHEN AN AUTO STANDS TRIAL FOR POLLUTING THE

As part of an "alternative transportation day" at the Oakland offices of the 
Bay Area Rapid Transit system, an automobile was put on trial for contributing 
to the world's environmental ills. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 cheering onlookers, including BART employees, attended the mock 
trial. After the car was found "guilty" of polluting and clogging up the 
freeways, bystanders took turns carrying out the sentence by smashing the 
vehicle with sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
"We urge you to strike a symbolic blow for cleaner air," said "Judge" Gregory 
Proops, who like many of the other trial participants, is a professional 
comedian. "But don't try this at home."

PACIFICARE MAKES SURPRISE OFFER TO BUY MAXICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to boost its already large membership in Southern California, 
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a Cypress-based health maintenance 
organization, said Thursday that it will make a bid to acquire bankrupt 
Maxicare Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the proposed acquisition were not disclosed. The offer comes five 
days before Maxicare was to present a disclosure statement to the federal 
bankruptcy court in Santa Ana. The statement's approval is a crucial step for 
reorganization and emergence from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Los Angeles-based Maxicare expressed surprise at the offer, which 
they said was unsolicited. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made it clear for more than a year that Maxicare is not for sale so we 
are, quite frankly, puzzled by the timing of this announcement, which comes 
just two business days before a crucial public hearing on our reorganization 
efforts," Peter J. Ratican, chairman and chief executive of Maxicare, said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer, said the company had 
informed Ratican of the forthcoming buyout proposal, which was to be presented 
this morning. He said the offer was expected to be a starting point for 
extended negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Maxicare would make an excellent strategic addition for 
PacifiCare," Terry Hartshorn, PacifiCare's president and chief executive, said 
in a statement. "Maxicare's largest single membership component is in 
California, which also represents our largest geographic concentration of 
membership." 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare officials said 130,000 of Maxicare's 320,000 members are in 
California, where about 450,000 of PacifiCare's 638,000 members also are 
located. The acquisition would boost PacifiCare's total membership by more than 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
Ratican said in an interview that he expects Maxicare to emerge from bankruptcy 
later this year. While he has an obligation to creditors, stockholders and 
clients to consider any offer, Ratican said he still expects Maxicare "to be an 
aggressive competitor of theirs (PacifiCare) in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare's interest in Maxicare, he said, "is an indication that they think 
this management has turned the company around." 
</P>
<P>
Ratican said he had previous discussions with PacifiCare about the possible 
sale of a few Maxicare operations. But those discussions, which ended in March, 
1989, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
While no financial details were released, Ratican noted that Cigna, a 
diversified insurance company based in Philadelphia, recently announced it 
would pay $777 million to buy Nashville-based Equicor, which has 450,000 
members in 19 HMO plans. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hoops, PacifiCare's chief operating officer, would say only that 
PacifiCare would expect to offer Maxicare's creditors as much as they have been 
promised in Maxicare's plan of reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
That plan calls for creditors and shareholders to receive about $102 million in 
cash, $67 million in notes and common stock and warrants. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare's bold bid surprised some industry analysts who noted PacifiCare has 
a conservative reputation for consistent profitability and for building 
membership and profits from internal growth. 
</P>
<P>
"PacifiCare is a very consistent player that usually hits singles and doubles. 
Although they have very good and capable management, they usually don't go for 
home runs," said Larry Selwitz, health-care analyst for Cruttenden &amp; Co., 
an investment banking firm in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other HMOs -- including Maxicare -- that experienced losses during 
an industry depression several years ago, PacifiCare has shown consistent 
profits since it went public in 1985, in part because it has done well 
investing its surplus cash. 
</P>
<P>
In its last fiscal year, ended Sept. 30, PacifiCare posted revenue of $650 
million, up 52% from revenue of $428 million from fiscal 1988 and earnings of 
$10.9 million, up 71% from the previous year. The company's strong growth has 
continued into 1990, with first-quarter earnings hitting $2.9 million, up from 
$1.1 million for the same quarter in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, by contrast, in the first nine months of 1989 showed a net loss of 
$22.3 million. However, company officials say they have managed to increase the 
company's cash flow by trimming overhead and that they expect Maxicare to 
become profitable in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Both Maxicare and PacifiCare operate similarly in that they contract for 
independent physicians and hospitals to provide service to their members, 
unlike other HMOs that own hospitals and clinics and hire their own medical 
staffs.

Sprint to Proceed With Toll-Free IRS Number: US Sprint Communications Co. said 
it will go ahead with a disputed proposal to offer special 800-number calling 
for taxpayers seeking information from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
One of Sprint's major rivals, MCI Communications Corp., had challenged the 
"enhanced" toll-free offering in court, saying the service fell outside the 
scope of the contract for the new federal long-distance system known as FTS 
2000. Sprint is providing 40% of FTS 2000; AT&amp;T has 60%. The taxpayer 
assistance service handles more than 60 million calls per year, according to 
Sprint, which valued the contract at $450 million over 10 years. MCI said it 
may file an appeal in the case.

FDA Orders Perrier to Change Its Labels: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
told Perrier to remove the phrase "naturally sparkling" from bottles of the 
imported mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said Perrier's claim to be "naturally sparkling" is false because the 
water is not naturally carbonated as it comes out of the ground at a spring in 
Vergeze, France. The water from the spring is mixed with carbon dioxide from a 
gas reservoir beneath it after impurities in the gas are filtered out. The firm 
said all Perrier bottled after July 29 would bear the new label, which will 
say, "Natural mineral water."

Pension Fund Joins UAL Suit: California's state pension fund said it would join 
in a shareholder lawsuit against UAL Corp. over $76 million in fees paid for a 
failed management-led buyout of the airline last fall. Officials at the 
$56-billion California Public Employees' Retirement System said the expenses 
from UAL's unsuccessful buyout should have been paid by the buyout group, not 
by UAL, parent company of United Airlines. Shareholders sued, arguing that the 
payments were an improper use of corporate money by members of management.

Infant Pillow Recall: Six manufacturers have agreed to immediately recall more 
than 600,000 infant pillows linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 infants, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said. The pillows are dangerous because they 
can conform to a baby's face, causing suffocation in infants unable to roll 
over, commission staffers said. Recalled are: 467,000 "Mothers Helper" cushions 
made by Hollander Home Fashions, Newark, N.J.; 110,000 "Gold Bug Support 
Sacks," Gold Inc., Denver; 35,700 "Cozy Cushions," Pinky Baby Products, 
Houston; 12,000 "Cozy Baby" pillows, Cozy Baby Products, Mount Vernon, N.Y.;

LOCKHEED NET UP 11% IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed earned $69 million on sales of $2.3 billion in the first quarter, an 
11% gain over the $62 million earned last year on sales of $2.1 billion, the 
company announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep branded as "pure 
harassment" a lawsuit filed the day before by Texas investor Harold C. Simmons 
seeking to invalidate the results of Lockheed's recent corporate election. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' group launched the proxy fight for control of Lockheed but was 
defeated by the current management team, led by Tellep. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely disappointed that Simmons has chosen to ignore the 
independently certified results despite losing the election by over a 20% 
margin," Tellep said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said its increased sales were generated across the company and that 
its aeronautical and technology services segments showed improvements. Overall 
profit from programs was the same as last year, but provisions for income taxes 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
Funded backlog was $7.7 billion on March 25, up from $7.1 billion at the end of 
1989.

Pacific Telesis Group Thursday, reported that first-quarter earnings fell 14.5% 
to $262 million from a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 
totaled $2.37 billion, up 1.3% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based company noted that the first-quarter results were 
lowered by the annual $391-million rate reduction associated with California's 
new regulatory framework that took effect Jan. 1, and by increased expenses. 
However, the rate reduction was partially offset by $72 million in lower 
settlement payments for the intrastate pooling process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a decline in earnings just as we said, but the good news is our 
business fundamentals are still very strong," said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief 
executive. "Our confidence remains high due to the potential to increase 
earnings under California's new regulatory framework and our cellular and cable 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cellular business had another excellent quarter, with strong growth in 
cash flow, net income, revenues and customers," Ginn said. 
</P>
<P>
PacTel Cellular's net income for the three months rose 74% to $16.9 million, up 
from $9.7 million for the first quarter of 1989. Revenue rose 36.3% to $134.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Pac Tel's Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell subsidiaries added more than 144,000 new 
customer lines during first quarter. The two firms now have about 13.8 million 
lines in service, an increase of 4.2% over the same period of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company said expenses for the quarter rose 6.5%.

BankAmerica Corp.'s first-quarter profit rose slightly from the same period 
last year, and the company Thursday attributed that to an absence of Brazilian 
cash interest payments and increased outstanding common shares. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based parent of Bank of America reported that net income for 
the period ending March 31 totaled $278 million, up 1% from $275 million 
reported in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989's first quarter, BankAmerica received $46 million in Brazilian interest 
payments, which increased net income in that period by $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
"First-quarter earnings demonstrate continuing success in managing the 
fundamental areas of our business, producing growth in the volumes of deposits 
and loan originations, as well as continuing strong credit performance," said 
Chairman A. W. Clausen. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica in January reported a 52% increase in its 1989 earnings, a 
$1.1-billion figure that represented the highest annual profit ever for the 
nation's second-largest bank holding concern. 
</P>
<P>
As of May 24, Clausen will step down from BankAmerica, the company he joined in 
1949 and rose through the ranks to head. Replacing him will be Richard 
Rosenberg, BankAmerica's vice chairman.

SEMATECH SEEKS TO BLOCK SALE TO JAPAN FIRM

<P>
Calling it a "tremendous blow" to U.S. competitiveness, high-technology 
research consortium Sematech has launched a campaign to block the sale of a 
small semiconductor equipment company to a Japanese firm. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech officials said they would ask federal regulators to reject the sale of 
Semi-Gas Systems Inc. of San Jose to Nippon-Sanso of Tokyo. The deal must face 
U.S. government approval on antitrust and national security grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Semi-Gas is the world's leading maker of gas containment systems used in the 
manufacturing of semiconductors. Last week, parent company Hercules Corp. of 
Wilmington, Del., announced plans to sell the company to Nippon-Sanso for a 
reported $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be extremely disappointed to see a strong, viable company like Semi-Gas, 
which is competing very well in Japan . . . sold to the Japanese," Sematech 
spokesman Joe Stroop said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stroop said the consortium could do little to block the sale except make 
its views known to officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal is the latest to spark controversy over the sale of U.S. 
technology companies to the Japanese. Last year, five U.S. electronics 
companies joined forces in a consortium to keep the semiconductor equipment 
division of Perkin-Elmer Corp. from being sold to a Japanese buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders have warned that vital U.S. defense interests could be at 
stake if the U.S. chip toolmaking industry were to fall under foreign control. 
Semiconductors are critical components of computers and military systems. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech was founded in 1987 to ensure continued U.S. competitiveness in 
semiconductor manufacturing in the face of increased competition from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Austin, Tex., group said it attempted to persuade federal 
officials that the sale of Semi-Gas would significantly weaken U.S. 
competitiveness in a critical part of the semiconductor manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale of Semi-Gas goes through, Sematech will cancel a development 
agreement it has with Semi-Gas because of fears that proprietary technology 
could be transferred to the Japanese, Stroop said.

SURVEY FINDS WIDE SUPPORT FOR BUSH STANCE ON THE NEA; 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT 93% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT 
TO VIEW CONTROVERSIAL ARTWORKS. 
</P>

<P>
The year-old controversy over artistic freedom and the National Endowment for 
the Arts has captured the American consciousness to an extent actors in the 
debate may not have thought possible, a new national survey released Thursday 
appears to show. 
</P>
<P>
The new survey -- of 1,200 people questioned at random by telephone between 
March 14 and 26 -- shows that in the fight over whether Congress should place 
controls on the content of artworks the NEA may support, 61% support the NEA 
and the Bush Administration, which oppose the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 93% of Americans believe the public has a right to 
view controversial artworks and 80% disagree with the contention that nudity in 
art is usually pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of respondents -- 53% -- agreed that art should be censored 
if it offends a majority of people and 86% said art galleries should notify 
parents if work they display is unsuitable for viewing by children. A total of 
74% agreed that censorship in general "is not the American way" and 81% opposed 
laws limiting freedom of artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was sponsored by the liberal People for the American Way group and 
conducted by Research &amp; Forecasts Inc., a New York opinion survey 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
With support for federal government funding of the arts holding steady at about 
2-to-1 -- nearly the same ratio as in a similar poll conducted by The Times 
last fall -- the new survey results show that the months of controversy over 
arts funding in Washington and elsewhere has attracted the attention of a 
majority of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
While three quarters of a sample of 2,217 Americans last September said they 
had never heard of the controversy, 57% now say they are familiar with it. 
Moreover, the political battle has boosted the arts endowment's name 
recognition rate to 76% -- the same proportion familiar with the endowment's 
key congressional opponent, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
Only 30% of the respondents in the new nationwide poll believe government 
funding for avant garde art should be stopped because some of it is 
controversial, and 66% disagreed with the contention that Congress should cut 
off funding for controversial art projects or shows. 
</P>
<P>
The new opinion poll was released simultaneously at press briefings in 
Washington and Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, People for the American Way also 
announced a newspaper advertising campaign intended to target Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), a leader of anti-arts endowment forces in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Full-page advertisements -- depicting an empty picture frame over the headline 
"Is This the Only Kind of Art Rep. Rohrabacher Would Be Happy With?" -- are to 
be placed in several Southern California newspapers, said Michael Hudson, 
Western vice-president of People for the American Way. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher criticized the People for the American Way poll, contending that 
"many of the questions were worded in a way that had no relationship to the 
battle that's going on over the NEA." Rohrabacher took issue with the poll's 
focus on censorship. "If someone asks me if I'm in favor of censorship," 
Rohrabacher said, "I emphatically say, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
Helms did not respond to requests for comment. The NEA also declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans overwhelmingly reject censorship of the arts and support the NEA," 
Hudson said. "Rep. Rohrabacher has taken the leading role in the House calling 
for the abolishment of the NEA. If we are to win this battle, we must energize 
and mobilize the creative community here in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The new survey also found that: 
</P>
<P>
* Attendance at arts events is more popular than going to live sporting events 
nationwide, with 72% of respondents reporting attending arts events in the last 
year compared to 53% who went to sporting events. Arts attendance averaged six 
events per year compared to 4.1 for sports. 
</P>
<P>
* A total of 68% endorse the concept of government funding of the arts, with 
30% opposed and 2% unsure. However, 60% also agreed that the NEA should be held 
responsible for the content of artworks it supports and a slim majority -- 51% 
-- agreed that artists who get government grants should "sign an oath regarding 
the content of their art." 
</P>
<P>
* The arts endowment had a higher positive opinion rating than Helms -- 30% 
versus 11%. A total of 69% disagreed with the notion that the NEA is a waste of 
taxpayers' money and 83% agreed with the statement that the NEA "serves a very 
useful purpose for American society." 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly a quarter of respondents favor increasing the NEA budget -- $171 
million this year -- and 56% favor keeping budget levels as they are. Only 13% 
advocated cutting NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
The poll sample had an average age of 40. It was 52% female and 48% male. The 
sample was split almost evenly among Republicans, Democrats and people who 
identified themselves as independent. Research &amp; Forecasts said the poll 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'TRAFFIK' A NEEDLE-SHARP THRILLER ABOUT THE HEROIN TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is an incredibly good program about the planet that says nothing about the 
greenhouse effect, global warming or the destruction of rain forests. No talk 
of ecosystems here, and the only reference to "green" concerns money. 
</P>
<P>
However, if it's true that life is fragile and that all the living organisms of 
our environment are mutually dependent and interwoven, then this five-part 
British miniseries making its PBS debut Sunday on "Masterpiece Theatre" is 
indeed stunningly on target for Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffik" (8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24; 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15) is about 
the heroin trade, its few beneficiaries and its infinite victims. 
</P>
<P>
What you have here are six hours of tingles (the premiere is two hours) in an 
international thriller stretching from the poppy fields and teeming slums of 
Pakistan to the corrupt rich of Hamburg to the power elite and the filthy, 
needle-infested haunts of drug addicts in London. 
</P>
<P>
Although the locales are different, the message is directly applicable to the 
horrendous drug problem in the United States and its tentacles abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, there's difficulty unraveling the complex weave of characters 
populating this unusual, absolutely gripping drama by Simon Moore. However, 
soon it's evident that his overall scenario encloses three interconnected 
stories in separate locations. 
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, the pauper Fazal (Jamal Shah) ekes out a meager living for his 
wife and two small children by working in the vast fields of opium-yielding 
poppies that are transformed into the illegal heroin that brings fabulous 
wealth and an aura of legitimacy to German drug smuggler Karl Rosshalde (George 
Kukura) and his British wife, Helen (Lindsay Duncan), in Hamburg. Meanwhile, 
British cabinet minister Jack Lithgow (Bill Paterson) goes to Pakistan to 
explore giving that nation financial aid in exchange for destroying the poppies 
that are the livelihood of innocent farmers like Fazal, but which ultimately 
become the heroin that ruins lives in England and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
This global intersecting of lives is intensified when Rosshalde is arrested in 
Hamburg for drug trafficking ("traffik" is German for traffic), Lithgow 
discovers that his Cambridge-student daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) is 
addicted to heroin and a desperate Fazal gets a job with a powerful drug 
kingpin (Talat Hussain) in Karachi. In spite of his new line of work, which he 
has undertaken simply to feed his family, you feel the deep humanity of Fazal. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alastair Reid has superbly mounted "Traffik" in all three countries, 
but it's his scenes of Pakistani poverty -- set against the physical beauty of 
the poppy fields and glittery opulence of the drug smugglers -- that are most 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
There are fine performances here from top to bottom. Yet the great dramatic 
strength of "Traffik" comes from the way its protagonists are at once closely 
bound and, for the most part, distanced from each other, and from its depiction 
of the poppy as life-giving to the humble Pakistani farmer and, further down 
the line, deadly to the heroin user. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that grows from the ground is evil," Lithgow hears from a Pakistani 
who rationalizes the poppy fields. "There are only evil men." In essence, that 
is the same self-serving "guns-don't-kill, people-kill" argument put forth by 
the gun lobby in the United States. In a way, though, it also relates to the 
complaint by cocoa growers in Colombia, that the cocaine trade is not being 
fueled by them, but by the U.S. cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
Through Lithgow's daughter, Caroline, "Traffik" touches the soul of addiction, 
depicting with savage clarity the depths to which the addict sinks to support a 
habit. These ugly sequences are sometimes explosive, other times enigmatic. At 
one point Caroline visits her dying grandfather in the hospital and, after he 
falls asleep, kisses him. Then she steals his money. 
</P>
<P>
There are other moments of deep irony: 
</P>
<P>
* The same brutal Pakistani drug lord who boasts of turning "poppy into gold" 
chastises his son for disobeying the laws of Islam by drinking alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
* As his young son watches, an Afghanistan man involved in the drug trade 
converts poppies to heroin. Then his entire family takes part in packaging the 
drug for transport to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
* Helen Rosshalde shows a sweetly tender side with her young son, then 
continues her quest to keep the family heroin business afloat and maintain her 
rich lifestyle while her husband awaits trial and two German narcs shadow her. 
</P>
<P>
It is Helen Rosshalde, in fact, who turns out to be the most fascinatingly evil 
and complex character in the story, as she later icily plots the murder of a 
witness against her husband: "There's always a way. If people can shoot the 
Pope and the President, you can get to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
There are some foggy areas in "Traffik," especially relating to inexplicable 
police security lapses in the fifth episode, and the ending disappoints in the 
way it unrealistically ties everything together in a big fat knot. Overall, 
though, "Traffik" is terrific work. 
</P>
<P>
This is not only a drama that is continuously challenging and suspenseful, but 
also one packing as much meat as style -- the kind of epic, sometimes 
politically pointed miniseries that the British deliver with a regularity that 
leaves nearly all U.S. miniseries makers in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
As a bonus, moreover, this is no tabloid docudrama drawn from screaming 
headlines or sensational crime stories whose facts are gratuitously shaped and 
reshaped for TV according to dramatic whim. This is fiction rooted in today's 
ugly reality. "Traffik" is its own screaming headline.

<P>
Oops: It was with great fanfare that the Democratic candidates for governor 
announced their agreement this week for a pair of historic prime-time televised 
debates to occur May 13 and 21, the first in San Francisco and the second in 
Los Angeles. Too bad they forgot to tell the television stations that are 
supposed to carry these hourlong poli-dramas. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS in Los Angeles says it offered different dates and no prime time. KPIX-TV 
said it had expressed interest in debates, but knew nothing of any agreement 
about any Sunday prime time until the morning papers landed on the station's 
doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble, it seems, is that the month from April 25 to May 23 is a critical 
ratings sweep to determine advertising rates for the months ahead. And debates 
are known losers in drawing viewers. The campaigns of John Van de Kamp and 
Dianne Feinstein say they are working to reach a new agreement for debates 
sometime, someplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No ecostroika here: Ecologist and population expert Paul Ehrlich doesn't have a 
high opinion of California's campaign for governor. "Never has so much money 
been spent to say so little," Ehrlich, author of The Population Explosion, said 
in asking the three major candidates to speak to the question of making life 
here livable at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"With a highway system already in a state of gridlock, schools overwhelmed with 
too many students, exhausted water supplies, unbreathable air and unaffordable 
housing, how can California possibly be prepared for almost one-third more 
people?" Ehrlich asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking Ahead: Absentee voting will significantly affect the wind-up pace of 
the 1990 campaign. In the past, candidates planned to "peak" right before the 
first Tuesday in June, election day. But that was when absentee ballots 
amounted to about 5% of the vote. In 1988, that jumped to 14% statewide. And in 
recent special elections, absentees have reached half of the total ballots 
cast. That means that candidates who wait until that last week in May to raise 
last-minute charges, or air that final heroic round of TV commercials, will 
miss a great number of voters. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, watch for the crescendo to begin begin about the second week 
of May when the first absentee ballots are being marked up. Voters can request 
their ballot as soon as registration closes May 7.

<P>
Agricultural officials announced Thursday the discovery of two more 
Mediterranean fruit flies, this time in Azusa and Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
A single immature female Medfly was found near Azusa Tuesday in a previously 
uninfested area off Chadley Street, said Larry Cooper, an eradication project 
spokesman. The Pomona Medfly was found Wednesday in a loquat tree off Dudley 
Street, also in an uninfested area. No decision has been made on whether the 
areas will be treated with aerial malathion spraying.

A Glendale woman arrested after a hit-run accident had a blood-alcohol level 
more than five times the legal definition of drunk, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cathylynne Marie Johnson, who weighs 105 pounds and had the equivalent of three 
quarters of a pint of bourbon in her system two hours after the accident, told 
investigating officers she did not drink, police said. She had a blood alcohol 
reading of .46%, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament. In California, a 
reading of .08% is considered proof of drunkenness.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $400-MILLION PROJECT NEAR MARINA APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Channel Gateway, a $400-million high-rise office, condominium and apartment 
project next to Marina del Rey, won unanimous approval Thursday from the Los 
Angeles City Planning Commission after neighborhood leaders praised the massive 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-acre project, planned by developer Jerome Snyder and associates, will 
include 512 condominiums in two 16-story towers, 544 apartments in clusters of 
four-story buildings, a 314,000-square-foot office building, and parking for 
more than 3,460 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project will dramatically increase density in the already 
congested Lincoln Boulevard corridor, Venice community leaders said the largely 
residential development is a vast improvement over a shopping center and office 
complex once planned for the property.

<P>
A North Hollywood man, who set a series of fires in his neighborhood before he 
was caught by a Neighborhood Watch group, pleaded guilty Thursday to 17 counts 
of arson and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the blazes caused more than $25,000 in damage to structures and 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Reunald C. Parker, 31, entered the pleas at a preliminary hearing in San

DISSIDENT CHURCH LEADER PREACHES IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: EX-PRIEST SEEKS TO EXPAND INDEPENDENT AFRICAN-AMERICAN CATHOLIC 
CONGREGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL CHANDLER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Roman Catholic priest George A. Stallings, who created a furor last 
summer when he founded an independent African-American Catholic congregation in 
Washington, brought his fiery revival-style preaching to Los Angeles this week 
during well-received appearances in two black Protestant churches. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church on Harvard 
Boulevard, Stallings repeatedly brought a crowd of 800 to its feet, cheering 
and clapping, as he shouted out a challenge for them to develop faith "that can 
move mountains." 
</P>
<P>
As he danced about the stage behind the pulpit, a choir of 100 swayed to the 
rhythm of drums and an electric organ, belting out gospel hymns. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings, who is seeking to expand branches of his Imani Temple to other major 
U.S. cities, announced that he will be consecrated a bishop next month by an 
archbishop of an "Old Catholic" order that traces its lineage to Utrecht, 
Holland, during the 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington said 
Stallings had "excommunicated himself" by establishing the 1,400-member Imani 
Temple in defiance of Washington Cardinal James Hickey and by publicly 
disagreeing with a number of church teachings, including its ban on ordaining 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Old Catholic Archbishop Richard Bridges of Highland said in an interview at 
Faith United Methodist Church -- where Stallings spoke to about 150 people 
Wednesday night -- that he would consecrate Stallings during ceremonies in 
Washington on May 12. The Old Catholic Church represents about 2,000 parishes 
scattered throughout the United States, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Catholic movement dates to a dispute among Dutch Catholics who reacted 
against the declaration of papal infallibility made at the First Vatican 
Council of 1869-70. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Catholics have retained most Roman Catholic doctrines but rejected 
ecclesiastical unity under the Pope, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles, said that although the Roman Catholic Church recognizes Old Catholic 
(Utrecht) ordinations as being in the historic line of succession originating 
with the Apostle Peter, it considers the actions of Old Catholic clergy 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"They lack the apostolic mandate which can come only from the Pope," Coiro 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings' ecclesiastical status seemed unimportant to the congregants who 
responded to the Bible-quoting preacher by clapping, raising their arms and 
shouting encouragements. 
</P>
<P>
Alternating between humor and good-natured scolding, Stallings told the United 
Methodist gathering that "too many church folk are sitting on the premises 
rather than standing on the promises" of God. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to give our people a sense of ownership and empowerment," Stallings 
said later, "so they can worship in their own way. Churches thriving in the 
black community are those where they hear the Gospel in a tangible cultural and 
ethnic context." 
</P>
<P>
Methodist seminarian Jeff Sanders of the School of Theology at Claremont said 
Stallings' preaching was "very similar to (that of) successful black preachers, 
regardless of denomination. It's the identity question, the cultural black 
tradition. . . . Successful black churches are reclaiming their roots." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier during his current preaching circuit, Stallings spoke to a crowd of 
1,100 packed into a rented hall in Philadelphia. He is scheduled to speak in 
churches in Oakland and Tacoma, Wash., before returning home next week. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he said, he hopes to establish a branch of his African-American 
Catholic Church in Los Angeles. He has two congregations in the Washington area 
and one in Norfolk, Va.

COALITION SUES EPA IN BID TO HALT INCINERATOR PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Eastside and South-Central Los Angeles community groups opposed 
to a planned hazardous waste incinerator in Vernon sued the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, escalating a four-year campaign to 
halt the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court by the National Resources 
Defense Council on behalf of Mothers of East Los Angeles and Concerned Citizens 
of South-Central Los Angeles claims the agency failed to properly review the 
project before issuing a permit April 10. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, community activists and elected officials rallied 
opposition to the plant with a meeting at an East Los Angeles church and a 
protest march to the proposed incinerator site in Vernon, a small industrial 
city southeast of downtown Los Angeles that is surrounded by low-income, 
minority neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
"There are alternative locations. There are also alternative technologies," 
said Joel Reynolds, an attorney representing the community groups. "The EPA has 
taken a position that it doesn't have to look at alternatives, and that is 
central to this lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for California Thermal Treatment Services Inc., the company that 
wants to build the facility, predicted that the suit, like previous court 
challenges, will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Community activists claim the incinerator -- the first large-scale commercial 
incinerator in California -- will spew potentially cancer-causing materials 
into the already polluted region and create thousands of tons of toxic ash that 
would have to be buried in as-yet-undetermined locations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the incinerator project, which would be operated as a commercial 
enterprise, say it would reduce hazardous waste problems. Company lawyer Larry 
Straw said opponents have grossly exaggerated the health risks and have "no 
evidence whatsoever" to back up their claims. 
</P>
<P>
The federal lawsuit represents a new legal front in the battle over the 
controversial incinerator. Another active court case pits the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District against California Thermal Treatment Services. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed Thursday asks the court to order the EPA to rescind the 
hazardous waste disposal permit and require the agency to prepare an 
environmental study that includes an assessment of alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokeswoman Virginia Donohue said the agency "does not get into siting for 
hazardous waste facilities. That's a state and local issue and a zoning issue." 
</P>
<P>
"The EPA believes strongly in pollution reduction and hazardous waste 
prevention," Donohue said. "A well-built incinerator that meets environmental 
regulations and environmental controls has a valid place in hazardous waste 
management."

CITIES URGED TO TAKE ENVIRONMENTAL LEAD; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: LOCAL OFFICIALS FROM 28 NATIONS CONVENE IN LOS ANGELES TO DETERMINE 
IMMEDIATE STEPS THEY CAN TAKE TO ALLAY GLOBAL WARMING AND OTHER PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Declaring that national governments have been too slow to act, mayors and local 
officials from 28 nations convened in Los Angeles on Thursday, trying to reach 
agreement on immediate steps cities can take to allay global warming and other 
environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event, which drew delegates from Eastern European countries, 
the Third World and Western nations, said it marks a new level of activism by 
cities to curb global environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are, in effect, building our own pro-democracy movement with respect to 
environmental issues. We are unwilling to wait until the federal government or 
international bodies act, because we can't afford to wait," Irvine Mayor Larry 
Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles meeting follows an 18-nation conference on global warming 
called by President Bush, which ended Wednesday in Washington. Several of those 
meeting in Los Angeles criticized the President for stressing possible economic 
impacts and a need for further research instead of calling for immediate action 
to curb the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to deal with practical solutions more than simply debate about what is 
more important, research or economics," said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, a 
co-sponsor of the Los Angeles summit. 
</P>
<P>
By the time it ends today, sponsors hope that delegates will agree to a joint 
resolution committing their cities to concrete policies to slow global warming 
and the destruction of the Earth's protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Among steps cities can take, they said, are changing local building codes to 
require energy-saving florescent lighting, increasing use of mass transit, 
placing controls on ozone-destroying chemicals and planting trees. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal officials and scientists attending the conference conceded that the 
impact of their efforts is likely to be more political than environmental 
</P>
<P>
"It will make a tremendous difference," said Philip Michael Kelly, a leading 
climatologist from Great Britain. "There are obviously limits on how much 
localities can do in terms of a percentage of the total problem. But, (their 
influence) goes beyond strict percentage reductions." 
</P>
<P>
Agran of Irvine said cities can lead the way by example and by creating 
grass-roots political pressure on governments to approve more comprehensive 
international accords. Agran said Irvine is responsible for 1/1,000th of 
worldwide emissions of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs and other ozone-destroying 
chemicals and should be responsible for 1/1,000th of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine City Council has approved strict new controls on emissions of 
ozone-destroying CFCs that take effect July 1. Similar steps have been taken by 
Toronto, South Pasadena, San Jose, Denver, and the states of Hawaii and 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in our hands to move," said environmental official Lefkos T. Middleton of 
Nicosia, Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
The summit is co-sponsored by the city of Los Angeles, The Greenhouse Crisis 
Foundation, the Local Government Commission and the Center for Innovative 
Diplomacy.

EXTORTION CHARGES DROPPED IN KOREATOWN NEWSPAPER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Extortion charges were dismissed Thursday against three staff members of a 
Koreatown tabloid newspaper who had been accused of demanding money from 
businesses that were the subject of running investigative stories. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of charges was announced by Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ken Marks, who said the action was taken because prosecutors could not locate a 
key witness. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher of the Ka Ju News, Tae Kyun Kim, 45; chief reporter Sang Suk Kim, 
31, (no relation) and editor Kook Kyun Chung, 32, said the dismissal confirmed 
their claims that the charges were attempts at retaliation by business owners 
disgruntled over the paper's muckraking journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigators had accused the trio of demanding money to 
discontinue investigative reports about alleged improprieties at a car 
dealership and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope people know now that I told the truth in those articles," reporter Kim 
said after the hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors identified the missing prosecution witness as the former owner of a 
Koreatown car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said reports in Ka Ju News three years ago detailed fiscal malfeasance at 
the car dealership, which went bankrupt earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Kim, who five years ago uncovered a widespread bribery scheme that led 
to indictments of a state acupuncture licensing official and 47 fraudulently 
licensed practitioners, said he has since been targeted for investigation by 
several law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said the district attorney's office "already knows all about" the newspaper 
as a result of the acupuncture investigation and said he could not understand 
why other agencies had decided to investigate it. 
</P>
<P>
Police have been frustrated in gaining the cooperation of any alleged extortion 
victims, said Detective Ray Futami. At least 15 non-subscription publications 
in Koreatown have been under investigation since the spring of last year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Kim said he believes there are Korean publications extorting 
advertisers, but said his paper was mistakenly targeted.

AT THE GALLERIES: SMALL SHOW OUTSHINES THE BLOCKBUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blockbuster exhibition, that exhaustive, exhausting phenomenon that all but 
consumed American museums in the '80s, has a polar opposite in the Timken Art 
Gallery's series of "Focus" shows. 
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the hype, the blockbuster's shuffling hordes marvel en masse at 
temporary extravaganzas, while permanent collection galleries stand vacant. At 
the Timken, the permanent collection of European and American paintings and 
Russian icons is the focus, and works from other sources are brought into the 
gallery temporarily -- not to divert but to sharpen that focus. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastman Johnson: The Cranberry Harvest, Island of Nantucket" (through June 24) 
is the gallery's fourth "Focus" exhibition since the program began in 1984. 
Like the others, it zeroes in on a single painting from the collection, and 
puts it in the company of a dozen or so related works, studies by the same 
artist or variations on the theme by others. 
</P>
<P>
These shows broaden our understanding of the Timken's prized works, to be sure, 
but just as important, they nurture an approach to art based on sensitivity 
rather than the sensational. They encourage a slow, intimate discourse with the 
work, a pace of viewing and reviewing. There is room here for the gradual 
revelations and private discoveries that are all too often smothered by the 
flourishes and frenzy of the blockbuster show. Here, one can learn how a work 
of art is made, not just how it is marketed. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman Johnson, like all ambitious American artists of the 19th Century, 
sailed to Europe for his training. Born in Maine in 1824, he had already 
established a successful career as a portraitist before leaving for Dusseldorf 
in 1849, but experience in the academies, studios and museums of Europe earned 
him a credibility unattainable in the fledgling art schools of the U.S. Johnson 
studied figure and genre painting in Germany, the Hague and Paris before 
returning to the U.S. in 1855. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the demand for European training did not conflict with the equally 
insistent demand toward the middle of the century for a distinctly American 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"Let a bold genius scan our history, note our civilization, examine our life, 
and he will discover innumerable themes characteristic enough to excite the 
interest of the people," wrote one critic and champion of Johnson's work in 
1858. "Our colonial, pioneer and Revolutionary eras, the customs and local 
peculiarities of the land, are prolific subjects for pictorial art; let them be 
seized, with a native zest and true insight, and new life will be imparted to 
the limner and his achievements." 
</P>
<P>
Answering this call with "zest and insight," as well as good doses of nostalgia 
and sentimentality, Johnson resumed his American career with a series of 
portrait studies of the Chippewa Indians around Lake Superior. Not until 1859, 
however, with the painting, "Life in the South" (also called "Negro Life at the 
South" and "Old Kentucky Home") did he marry his interest in American themes 
with his study of genre, the portrayal of scenes from everyday life. The 
painting, an anecdotal treatment of leisure time in slave quarters, brought 
Johnson popular and critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Between "Life in the South" and the 1880 painting, "Cranberry Harvest, Island 
of Nantucket," the focus of the current Timken exhibition, Johnson pursued 
several other themes -- farmers at work, families at home, children at play and 
more. Several of these culminated in broad horizontal tableaux, epic images 
composed of numerous small vignettes. "Cranberry Harvest" was Johnson's last 
major effort of this type, and it is regarded by many to be his genre 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
A sweeping view of the golden-brown cranberry bog and its harvesters, the 
painting epitomizes Johnson's sanitized, idealized vision of rural labor. The 
workers -- men, women and children -- bend over the sandy earth in search of 
the small crimson berries, but their crop is less Johnson's concern than the 
process of its gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the quaint island of Nantucket since he first began spending time 
there about 1870, Johnson observed the September harvest with a passion he 
called his "cranberry fit." He respected the communal nature of the labor and, 
most likely, exaggerated its overtones of play and courtship. Men gaze warmly 
at the women working at their sides, and, throughout the finished painting and 
the 13 studies included in the show, couples pair off for various tasks or a 
flirtatious break. The sentimentality of the scene is further enhanced by a 
charming trio of children making a game of their work, an older man picking 
berries from a chair next to an admiring young girl, and most of all, by the 
young boy carrying his infant charge to his mother, who stands like a vertical 
anchor near the center of the image. 
</P>
<P>
Golden dabs of light grace the cheeks and shoulders of the workers, a stoic, 
clean and proud class -- no sweat or soreness here. American art scholar 
Patricia Hills has written of the nationalism and nostalgia influencing such an 
approach: "Turning to rural themes was, to be sure, a manifestation of the 
cultural protest against the industrial revolution with its concomitant 
overcrowded city slums, its urban pollution and human exploitation." 
</P>
<P>
As American as Johnson's sensibility was, however, his style and subject matter 
borrowed heavily from the European painters -- especially French -- whose work 
he admired at home and had studied abroad. Thomas Couture, whose Paris studio 
hosted a bevy of American art students, including Johnson, was a great champion 
of the painted sketch, the quickly brushed study from life, en plein air. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's studies here reveal a fresh, vigorous touch that, according to the 
conventions of 19th-Century painting, was exchanged for more deliberate, 
refined brushwork in the finished painting. By contemporary standards, the 
final composition looks stiff and staid next to the immediacy and directness of 
the studies. While Johnson defines the figures in the final painting by the 
layers and folds of their clothing, he is content in the studies to convey the 
same gestures through dry dashes of solid color. In the large canvas, the 
workers labor atop the land; in the studies (most on paper board), they merge 
with it in a seamless union of brush strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing Johnson's finished work alongside his studies of the landscape and 
cranberry pickers is a luxury afforded only by time and scholarship. Though 
Johnson admired the energy of the painted sketch form, he -- and most artists 
of his generation -- never considered such studies suitable for exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for exposing this slice of art and social history goes to guest curator 
Marc Simpson of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Simpson, his colleague 
Sally Mills and Johnson scholar Patricia Hills from Boston University, have 
each contributed an essay to the show's informative and richly illustrated 
catalogue.

SCOTT IS HURT IN VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: INJURY TO HIS LEFT ANKLE IS CALLED A "MODERATE" SPRAIN, BUT X-RAYS WILL 
BE TAKEN TODAY. L.A. DEFEATS TIMBERWOLVES, 113-89. 
</P>

<P>
What the Lakers must have secretly feared most in these final, relatively 
insignificant games of the NBA's regular season was an injury to a significant 
player. 
</P>
<P>
But that proved unavoidable in a 113-89 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves 
on Thursday night, when guard Byron Scott sprained his left ankle less than two 
minutes into the third quarter before 17,505 fans at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of Scott's injury and length of recovery has yet to be determined. 
Gary Vitti, the Lakers' trainer, called it a "moderate" sprain and said Scott 
probably will not play in the final two regular-season games. He is scheduled 
to have X-rays this morning to determine the full extent of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shooting for having him practice on Tuesday," Vitti said. "If he can get 
through (Thursday night) and control the swelling, I think we've got it 
licked." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who missed three games earlier in the season with an aggravation of his 
left hamstring injury, will have a week to nurse his ankle into playing shape. 
The Lakers will open the first round of the playoffs against either Houston or 
Seattle next Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining injury-free may be the Lakers' goal going into the season's final 
weekend. To that end, Coach Pat Riley sat his starters for nearly all of the 
fourth quarter. Riley has said he does not want to rest his core players too 
much for fear that they will lose their competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was injured when he and teammate Mychal Thompson jumped to rebound a 
Timberwolves' shot. Scott grabbed the ball and, trying to avoid Thompson, 
landed awkwardly on his left ankle. He had to be helped from the court, unable 
to put much pressure on his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, according to Laker spokesman John Black, declined to comment on how he 
suffered the sprain or how his ankle feels. 
</P>
<P>
With or without Scott, the Lakers breezed. Michael Cooper compensated for 
Scott's loss by scoring 14 points -- including consecutive three-point baskets 
in the third quarter -- and passing for a season-high 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge led all Lakers with 23 points. Tony Campbell, a former Laker, 
had 25 for the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that, regardless of the outcome of today's X-rays, the Laker guard 
will sit out the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
Riley also said he will check with General Manager Jerry West about putting 
Scott on the injured list and re-activating Steve Bucknall, a rookie swingman 
waived by the club on March 5. "I would only do it if putting Byron on the 
injured list would not carry over into the playoffs," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley might need another player if he chooses to rest his starters more. 
Johnson played 30 minutes Thursday, A.C. Green 31, Worthy 26 and Thompson 14. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said it is counterproductive to sit players for fear of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK, just a sprain," Riley said. "He'll be back probably by Tuesday's 
practice. We can't walk on eggshells. You don't want (injuries) to happen at 
this time of the year, but you can't not play people. As soon as you back off 
to start avoiding injuries, that's what's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our starters to play about 25 to 30 (minutes per game). That's what 
I'll play them the next two games. But without Byron, it forces us to play 
Earvin (Johnson) more, unless we go out and bring in another player for the 
final two games -- if we can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson has been bothered for the past week with tendinitis in his left 
Achilles' tendon because of a misplaced support lift in his new shoes. "Two 
years ago, he had some tendinitis in his Achilles', so Converse put some lifts 
in his shoes and he was all right," trainer Gary Vitti said. "When Magic got 
his new shoes, the company put the lift in the sole instead of between the shoe 
and the sole, where it was supposed to be." Johnson has had soreness and has 
been receiving ice treatments. Vitti said the shoe company has corrected 
Johnson's shoes. "The tendinitis wasn't as bad as it was a couple years ago," 
Vitti said. "When he started getting it, we immediately looked at the shoes." . 
. . The Madison Square Garden Network, which broadcasts the New York Knicks 
games, recently polled NBA coaches on the major awards. Twenty-two of the 27 
coaches responded. Johnson beat out Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan for the 
most valuable player award. Pat Riley was voted coach of the year by his peers.

PETE ROSE MAY FACE PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: ALL-TIME HIT LEADER WILL PLEAD GUILTY TODAY TO FILING FALSE TAX 
RETURNS. HE COULD BE SENTENCED TO SIX YEARS AND FINED UP TO $500,000.

<P>
Pete Rose, the former Cincinnati Red manager who was banned from baseball for 
life last year because of alleged gambling violations, will plead guilty today 
to filing false tax returns and could be sentenced to six years in prison and 
fined $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Documents unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati showed that 
Rose has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of filing false tax returns by 
failing to report income from memorabilia sales, autograph signings and 
personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with federal prosecutors, culminating a lengthy investigation by 
a Cincinnati grand jury, bars the government from pressing additional tax 
charges but carries no restrictions on sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in 
Cincinnati this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel could sentence Rose to a maximum of three years in jail on each count 
and a maximum fine of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rose acknowledges in the documents that he under-reported his income by 
$354,968 from 1984 through 1987 and owes taxes of $162,703. 
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, Rose's tax returns for that period showed taxable 
income of $4.6 million, on which he paid $2 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors declined Thursday to comment on the agreement, as did Rose's 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is the IRS did a lengthy investigation on me, and we 
cooperated in every way that we possibly could," Rose said during his weekly 
Thursday night talk show in Cincinnati. "And now we're trying to get everything 
behind me. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another thing that happened because of the gambling problems I 
had. And hopefully the people understand and we'll get this thing taken care 
of." 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, who can either accept or reject the plea bargain, is the judge who 
presided over the recent drug and tax-evasion trial of Rose's former friend and 
housemate, Tommy Gioiosa, who was sentenced to five years in jail after being 
convicted of transporting cocaine and conspiracy to defraud the Internal 
Revenue Service by claiming Rose's race-track winnings on his own tax reports. 
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy incident occurred at Turfway Park in Northern Kentucky on 
Jan. 16, 1987, when Rose was part of a group that won $47,646 in the Pik Six. 
All of that income was reported by Gioiosa, though Rose has since admitted that 
he shared in it but did not realize his name had to be included on the tax form 
filed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Neither that, nor any of Rose's other race-track winnings, are mentioned in the 
plea agreement. Rose has said that he never claimed gambling income on his 
taxes, maintaining that he lost more than he won. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was banned from baseball on Aug. 23, and, although he denied ever betting 
on baseball or on his team, Rose accepted a lifetime term -- the punishment for 
such an offense -- in an agreement with the late commissioner, Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement culminated an investigation by special counsel John Dowd, who was 
primarily examining Rose's gambling habits and associations. However, Dowd 
wrote in his 225-page report that Rose, through memorabilia sales and personal 
appearances, received large amounts of cash that were difficult to trace. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who is baseball's all-time leader in base hits, has said that he 
generally asked for cash payments because he feared promoters' checks might 
bounce. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, a federal grand jury was in the midst of an investigation into 
whether Rose reported his income from those activities. 
</P>
<P>
The jury concluded its investigation earlier this year, and Rose's lawyers 
reached the plea agreement before an indictment was issued. Rose signed the 
agreement Monday, according to the court documents.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

BREWERS' 11 RUNS GIVE THEM 42 IN FOUR GAMES

The Milwaukee Brewers are continuing their habit of taking batting practice 
once the game begins. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night at Arlington, Tex., the Brewers beat the Texas Rangers, 11-0, 
giving them 42 runs in their last four games. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Brewers defeated the Rangers, 11-6. At Fenway Park on Monday, 
Milwaukee routed Boston, 18-0. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive output Thursday made it easy for Chris Bosio, who pitched a 
four-hitter for the American League's first complete game of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bosio, who led the Brewers with 15 victories last season, struck out five and 
walked one. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first decent weather we've had this year," Bosio said. "I got a 
good sweat going and was loose." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Vaughn and B.J. Surhoff each homered off Bobby Witt (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Bosio (1-0) retired the first nine batters before Gary Pettis and Rafael 
Palmeiro singled in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Seattle 2 -- Dave Stewart kept his April winning streak going, 
allowing five hits and one run in seven innings at Oakland for his 17th 
consecutive victory in the opening month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who lost his first 11 decisions in April, is 3-0 with a 1.86 
earned-run average this season and 13-0 against Seattle since joining Oakland 
in 1987. He has won 17 of 18 April starts since an April 15, 1987 loss to 
Minnesota, and the A's won his only no-decision, 5-4 over Toronto on April 24, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Detroit 2 -- Oriole fans, anxious to cheer a team that went from 
the cellar to second place in the American League East last season, finally got 
their chance as the Orioles took advantage of eight walks in their first game 
at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles were supposed to open at Memorial Stadium on April 2, but the 
owners' lockout changed the schedule and sent them on an eight-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson (2-0) scattered seven hits over six innings to earn the victory. 
Gregg Olson pitched the ninth inning to earn his fourth save and extend his 
club record of 25 scoreless appearances, the most since Warren Brusstar of the 
1983 Cubs put together 25 consecutive scoreless outings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 1, New York Yankees 0 -- Left-hander Greg Swindell (1-1) pitched 6 
1/3 scoreless innings, allowing three hits, striking out five and walking one 
at Cleveland as the Indians won their twice-delayed home opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians had gone scoreless for 21 innings until Tom Brookens tripled with 
one out in the sixth and, with Candy Maldonado at the plate, scored on a passed 
ball by catcher Rick Cerone.

COLTS TRADE FOR TOP PICK IN DRAFT, PROVIDING THEY CAN SIGN GEORGE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons agreed on Thursday to trade the first pick in Sunday's 
National Football League draft to the Indianapolis Colts, who will choose 
quarterback Jeff George of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons, who also will give Indianapolis a fourth-round draft pick this 
year, will get six-time Pro Bowl tackle Chris Hinton, wide receiver Andre 
Rison, the Colts' first-round draft choice in 1991 and a fifth-round pick this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is contingent upon the Colts signing George today. 
</P>
<P>
George supplanted Keith McCants in the No. 1 draft position after the Alabama 
linebacker's mediocre workout two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Leigh Steinberg flew to Indianapolis earlier Wednesday to begin 
negotiations with the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic," he said. "We will break out the caffeine and camp down 
until it's done." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg represented quarterback Troy Aikman last season, when the former UCLA 
star signed an $11-million, six-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys, who made him 
the No. 1 pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said he will seek more than Aikman received. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new year with a new television contract with enormous growth in it," 
Steinberg said. "I would think that once we get started, no matter who we're 
dealing with, we could get the thing done in five or six hours." 
</P>
<P>
With 72 hours to go before the draft, the Seattle Seahawks, Detroit Lions and 
San Francisco 49ers reportedly are trying to trade up toward the top of the 
first round. The San Diego Chargers, Chicago Bears, Buffalo Bills, Kansas City 
Chiefs and New York Giants are considering trading their No. 1 choices. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean that the first round is not a marquee-name round," said General 
Manager George Young of the Giants. "But there are some pretty good people in 
the second and third rounds." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers traded running back Gary Anderson, who sat out all of last season 
in a contract dispute, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a third-round pick on 
Sunday and a conditional second-round pick in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The conditional pick is based on Anderson gaining 1,000 yards combined in 
rushing and receiving in 1990. Anderson reached 1,000 yards twice in four years 
with the Chargers. If he fails to gain 1,000 yards, the Chargers will get Tampa 
Bay's third-round choice in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers traded running back Terrence Flagler and defensive end Danny Stubbs 
to Dallas for second-and third-round choices.

Viatcheslav Fetisov made a successful return to the Soviet national team, 
scoring a goal and adding three assists in a 10-1 blitz of Team USA at the 
World Hockey Championships in Bern, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Fetisov, perhaps the greatest defenseman in international hockey during the 
1980s, feuded with Soviet Coach Victor Tikhonov and was cut briefly from the 
team before the 1989 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He played in the NHL with New Jersey this season, and rejoined the Soviet team 
after the Devils' elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Soviet Union 
is 3-0, the United States 0-3.

Detroit's Steve Yzerman scored three goals and set up the winner by Shawn Burr 
late in the third period as Team Canada (3-0) came back from a four-goal

and Czechoslovakia also went 3-0 by beating Norway, 9-1.

Trainer Howie Tesher, who says he has never cashed a wager on a boxer in his 
life, might be betting his reputation on Champagneforashley, the 3-year-old 
colt who is the 6-5 favorite in Saturday's $500,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
The Wood is the last major prep for the Kentucky Derby, which will be run at 
Churchill Downs on May 5, and Tesher has brought Champagneforashley into the 1 
1/8-mile race off an unusual schedule, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
Champagneforashley has warmed up for the Wood by running in -- and winning -- 
the Tampa Bay Derby at Tampa Bay Downs and the DeWitt Clinton Handicap at 
Aqueduct. Because the fields for the Tampa Bay race have been so weak in recent 
years, and the Clinton is restricted to New York-breds, neither race has even a 
Grade III rating, which is the lowest classification for a stake of any 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
Tesher, 54, claims he was forced into running Champagneforashley in those 
races, but there are the usual rumors that the trainer is protecting the horse, 
running him in soft spots to assure his value as a stallion. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the rationale, Champagneforashley will find no soft spot Saturday. Ten 
horses are entered in the Wood, including the first three finishers -- Thirty 
Six Red, Senor Pete and Burnt Hills -- in the swiftly run Gotham Mile two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
All the congenial Tesher hopes is that he has better luck running 
Champagneforashley than he did betting on fighters. The other day at nearby 
Belmont Park, where Tesher's barn is located, Gil Clancy, the veteran boxing 
figure, was a visitor, so it made sense to talk about the manly art. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet on something like 25 fights in my life and never won any of them," 
Tesher said. "I remember losing three fights in a row on Carmen Basilio. I bet 
on a guy from Nassau who was supposed to have a setup in Miami against a 
fighter from New Orleans, and the New Orleans guy won. I even lost a bet 
against Muhammed Ali, after my brothers fixed his jaw." 
</P>
<P>
Tesher was referring to Ali's victory in a rematch with Ken Norton at the Forum 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The late Fred Tesher and his brother, Bob, studied dentistry and surgically 
reconstructed Ali's injured jaw. "They must have done a good job," Clancy said. 
"If there's one thing Ali could always do, it was take a punch to the jaw." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Morgan Tesher, the member of the family who learned early that he wasn't 
cut out to be a dentist, has been able to deflect the criticism he's getting 
over Champagneforashley, who could be the trainer's most important horse. In 
his only Kentucky Derby, Tesher finished 17th with Wolfie's Rascal in a 
19-horse field in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Champagneforashley, a New York-bred son of Track Barron and Champagne Babe, the 
Alleged mare, was bred by his owners, Howard Kaskel, Leon Feinbloom and Robert 
Baker, who have been partners in horses for 18 years. When Tesher showed the 
horse to Jacinto Vasquez last summer, the 45-year-old jockey postponed plans to 
retire and take up training. 
</P>
<P>
Champagneforashley -- whose name is a combination of the names of his dam and 
Baker's 7-year-old daughter -- ran for the first time last July and won by 14 
1/2 lengths. A cough and a minor lower leg injury prevented Tesher from running 
the colt again until November, when he won a stake for New York-breds by seven 
lengths. In December, Champagneforashley ran in open company for the first time 
and won the Nashua Stakes by nine lengths. 
</P>
<P>
As a 2-year-old, then, Champagneforashley won three times by a total of more 
than 30 lengths. Champagneforashley was sent to Florida for the rest of the 
winter, Tesher hoping to run him eventually in the Florida Derby or the 
Flamingo Stakes, traditional preps for the Kentucky Derby. The Flamingo was 
canceled when Hialeah, engaged in a long-running civil war with the two other 
South Florida tracks, aborted its season. The Florida Derby was eliminated from 
his plans, Tesher said, because he couldn't find a suitable tuneup race for 
Champagneforashley at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Miami, many of my friends live there, and it was important for me to 
run the horse at Gulfstream. But they treated us like strangers, and every time 
a condition book (a schedule of upcoming races) came out, there was no race in 
it for my horse." 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream officials said there were races available for Champagneforashley. At 
any rate, his debut as a 3-year-old turned out to be the Tampa Bay Derby, the 
day after the Florida Derby. Champagneforashley won by 1 1/2 lengths, beating 
no horses of consequence, and after the race, Tesher was a relieved but harried 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse usually has a great temperament, but that day he was nuts," he 
said. "We couldn't saddle him. He threw Vasquez in the post parade, and he 
broke real bad." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the colic, which knocked Champagneforashley out of training after the 
race, was already coming on. It prevented Tesher from running him in the 
Gotham. Looking around, the only race the trainer could find in New York was 
the DeWitt Clinton, which would take Champagneforashley back in distance, from 
1 1/16 miles to seven furlongs. Against a field that was even weaker than the 
one he faced at Tampa Bay Downs, Tesher's horse won by 12 1/2 lengths in an 
excellent time of 1:21 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Tesher smiled at that performance, but his critics persist, and 
Champagneforashley needs to extend his winning streak Saturday before they'll 
give the trainer some room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>

CHILEAN PLACE IS LIKABLE LETDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
LA GAVIOTA DE VINA: DISHES RANGE FROM DELICIOUS TO DISAPPOINTING AND THE 
SERVICE IS SLUGGISH, BUT IT'S A PLACE YOU'D LIKE TO LIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the time, I'm pretty clear about whether I like a restaurant, but every 
now and then I have trouble making up my mind. This happens, it seems, when I 
want very badly to like a place. 
</P>
<P>
I really wanted to like La Gaviota de Vina, a new Chilean restaurant that has 
replaced the Red Rooster, a Yugoslavian restaurant on Van Nuys Boulevard. 
Anybody would want to like this restaurant, which looks almost the same as it 
did during its Red Rooster era. (I'd wanted to like the Red Rooster, too, so 
this dilemma might well come with the setting.) It's a modest, pretty dining 
room, with comfortable gray banquettes and shell-pink walls adorned with old 
musical instruments. La Gaviota's proprietors added black and white photographs 
of Chile, so that you can gaze at haunting Easter Island statues and the 
Chilean Ocean. I walked in for the first time and was charmed. 
</P>
<P>
My first meal there did little to discourage my high hopes. The ceviche, made 
with sea bass and little pink clams, was spicy and refreshing at the same time. 
And my own grandmother couldn't have made a more nourishing and hearty stew 
than the cazuela de vacuno, a clear broth with short ribs, potatoes, corn and 
carrots. The "Albacore Danny," described as swordfish sauteed in butter, was a 
mediocre cut of fish dressed to good advantage in a light tomato sauce; it 
wasn't nearly as compelling as the major mountain of mashed potatoes that came 
on the same plate. Yet all told, in that pretty room, with pretty good, 
reasonably priced food, we had a pretty good time. I looked forward to coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The second time I went with my friend Robert who, being very hungry, wanted to 
like the place as much as I did. We started with the abalone salsa verde, 
rounds of the shellfish topped with onions and cilantro on a bland potato 
salad. Neither one of us had ever had abalone that was so soft or tasted quite 
so . . . so tinny. I asked the waitress point-blank if it was canned. "Oh, 
yes," she said. "You can't get fresh abalone around here." 
</P>
<P>
Next, we tried the Arrollado de Malaya, which is a flank steak roll containing 
chard, carrots and hard-boiled eggs: a pretty dish, it tasted exactly like 
dinner leftovers. From there, we went on to the parrillada "Juan Chico," a 
mixed grill for two that came to the table on a nifty barbecue. This was a meal 
dreamed up by a true carnivore for others of his/her ilk: There were short ribs 
and skirt steak, sweetbreads and knotty ropes of tripe and dark spicy blood 
sausages. We countered the all-meat meal with bites of the Chilena salad 
(tomatoes and onions) and pepino con tomate (tomatoes and cucumber), which were 
both made with tasteless, grainy, oblong Italian tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
We finished up with a good light flan and coffee -- easier said than done 
because at some point during dinner our waitress vanished. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of my second visit. I was beginning to have divided feelings about 
La Gaviota. As we were leaving, Robert said, "The parrillada was really good, 
but it's hard to get around canned abalone." 
</P>
<P>
I still wanted to like the place. The third time, I hoped, would be the charm. 
Only it wasn't, not exactly. I went with my friend John, another intrepid 
carnivore, who ordered the Bife Aleman, a Chilean steak tartare. This turned 
out to be a huge portion of fresh and fluffy ground raw steak seasoned with 
lemon juice and garlic. We ate as much as we could, but there was enough left 
for many more appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
John then stole the evening by ordering the Pastel de Choclo, a fabulous, 
fascinating ground corn pie sprinkled with sugar and filled with ground beef, 
chicken, raisins, olives and spices: Sounds odd, tastes amazing. I sulked over 
my Bistec a lo Pobre that the waitress had recommended as an authentic Chilean 
steak dish, which it may well be. It's also standard coffee shop fare. Before 
we finished dinner we lost our waitress again, and this time it took well over 
30 minutes from the moment we decided to leave to find someone, get our check, 
pay and depart. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the truest test of how I feel about a place lies in whether I want to 
go back. Do I want to go back to La Gaviota? The answer, I have to admit, is 
yes . . . at least once, so that I can have one Pastel de Choclo all to myself. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: ceviche mixto, $7.95; Pastel de Choclo, $7.95; parrillada 
"Juan Chico" (for two), $22. 
</P>

A ROYAL DANCE SURVIVES IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE WHEELOCK, Wheelock is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Van Nuys apartment is small but immaculate. In a living room corner a 
Buddhist altar stands next to a sleek, black, late model stereo system, its 
bass and treble lights flashing brightly as music plays. Ten barefoot girls, 
ages 7 to 14, wearing an assortment of T-shirts, jeans and sarong skirts, are 
giggling and chattering in English and Cambodian as they line up according to 
size. They could be any group of schoolgirls, preparing to practice cheerleader 
routines. 
</P>
<P>
But as their teacher steps in front of the little group, chatter ceases and 
with solemn concentration they all begin to dance, their movements slow, 
stately, subtle, delicate and stylized, their hands and feet placed with 
exquisite precision. 
</P>
<P>
These girls, who look like ancient paintings come to life in modern clothes, 
are practicing something a bit more rarefied than school cheers. They are 
rehearsing a program of Cambodian classical dance they will perform for the 
Cambodian New Year's festival, to be held tomorrow at Van Nuys Recreation 
Center at Tyrone Avenue and Vanowen Street. And many of the dance movements 
they are striving to perfect can be traced back more than 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
How did this highly specialized and revered form of dance, once performed only 
for royalty, make its way to a modest Cambodian/Latino apartment complex in Van 
Nuys? And why do these lively, bright-faced young girls choose to forgo 
after-school playtime to practice this difficult and demanding dance? 
</P>
<P>
A strong national pride is at work here. Ever since the Khmer Rouge takeover of 
Cambodia in the 1970s, a time when many classical traditions, including music 
and dance, were brutally crushed, thousands of Cambodian refugees have 
relocated in Southern California by way of Southeast Asian refugee camps. 
Although the largest enclave is in Long Beach, Van Nuys is home to a number of 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Several of their young girls, eager to perpetuate nearly lost Cambodian 
classical and folk dances, participate in frequent classes under the aegis of 
the Cambodian Dance and Music Project of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Catlin, project director and UCLA and Caltech research ethnomusicologist, 
said the impetus for the plan came from the Van Nuys Cambodian community. 
</P>
<P>
"In the refugee camps, dancing was an important activity to bolster peoples' 
enthusiasm for their culture and renew their faith in its rebirth," Catlin 
said. "The Van Nuys families wanted to train their girls to be dancers and I 
offered to help them obtain an NEA grant so that free classes in classical and 
folk dance would be available to all who wanted them. The NEA funded the 
program from 1986 through 1989, but this year we're on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Defining the dance as "primarily a female art, an outgrowth of temple and court 
dancing that has been passed down through the centuries," Catlin said most 
girls start lessons at age 5 or 6, although babies often respond to the music 
and start to imitate gestures. 
</P>
<P>
One enthusiastic dancer is 14-year-old Fulton Junior High School student 
Pinthang Ouk, who has been dancing since she was 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the dance movements -- it's great for exercising your feet, toes, 
hands, fingers, neck, your whole body," Ouk said. "It's like slow motion, 
really smooth. I also like it that all the dances we do have meaning and tell 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
One of her teachers is her aunt, Sophanary Ouk, 27, who learned to dance in a 
Thailand refugee camp and immigrated here in 1981. She learned from Cambodian 
master teachers, and she feels a responsibility, she said, to pass along her 
expertise to the younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in Cambodia now," she said, "don't know what the dancing is like. 
I'll never forget it because it's special and important." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sophanary Ouk said she'd like to return to Cambodia some day, Pinthang 
Ouk said, "Maybe I'm too American. I've been here since I was 6 and I don't 
know anything over there, although I'd like to visit." 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys girls perform frequently in Southern California, and are often 
invited to dance at museums, schools, nursing homes and even weddings. This 
year, Catlin said, they hope to be included in the Open Festival, which will 
run concurrently with this fall's Los Angeles Festival and feature any arts 
group that produces, performs or exhibits work during the two weeks of the 
festivals. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the girls are looking forward to the New Year's celebration, 
although Pinthang said, "I always get nervous when I perform. It's really not 
easy to do and we work very hard to move just right and stay balanced." 
</P>
<P>
The dancers perform in resplendent, gold and sequin-trimmed silk costumes and 
headpieces that were funded by the grants from the National Endowment for the 
Arts and are carefully packed away in large boxes between wearings. Catlin 
said, "Some of the materials were obtainable only in Thailand and had to be 
imported. The costumes were made by two Cambodian tailors in Long Beach and are 
quite authentic, because the dance teachers have preserved photos of themselves 
and their own teachers, dancing in the refugee camps. The headpieces were hard 
to reproduce. Ours are made of thin sheet metal painted gold, with fake jewels 
and gold trim, and from a distance they look real." 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said authenticity of dress and dance has been achieved, in part, from 
studying pictures of ancient carvings found on walls of Buddhist monuments. 
</P>
<P>
"We know from these carvings that 1,000 years ago dance was an important part 
of the Angkor civilization. But in 1431 the Thais attacked Angkor Wat and 
carried off the dancers and musicians to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 19th-Century Khmer King Ang Doung had a revival of classical dance, and 
at that time the dancers were a part of the royal family and lived in the 
palace, never performing for outsiders. But by the 20th Century a lot of 
restrictions were liberalized and tourists were allowed to see an off-shoot 
group of palace dancers perform." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Catlin said, King Sihanouk founded the University of Fine Arts, 
and it was possible for any student to earn a degree in classical and 
traditional arts, thus broadening access to palace tradition. Such freedom of 
access, of course, was destroyed during the Pol Pot regime, when people were 
killed for performing these arts. Those who survived started teaching when they 
got to the refugee camps, doing what they could to keep the tradition alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys girls, as the current generation of torchbearers, are aware of the 
historical importance of their art, and even the youngest of them say that they 
want to show Cambodians and everyone else that they can preserve this part of 
their culture. They have been working hard to prepare for the New Year's 
festival, which is always an important event in the local Cambodian community. 
</P>
<P>
The event is free, although donations are requested to pay for hall rental and 
food. The festivities begin at 9 a.m., with a religious ceremony conducted by 
several monks, who bless not only the beginning of the new year, but also the 
ritual offerings of food from community families, who contribute their finest 
dishes. Pinthang Ouk said her family always spends $200 to $300 on food for 
their contribution. 
</P>
<P>
A communal feast is followed by an afternoon of entertainment, which includes 
the dancers as well as several singers and musicians playing various Cambodian 
instruments, including gong circles, zither, xylophones, flute, violins and 
drums. After the performance a disco band takes over, playing American and 
Cambodian dance music until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a demonstration of Cambodian culture, it is Cambodian culture," 
Catlin said. "It's done for community, not educational purposes." And although 
the dancers will be in the park instead of the royal palace, their dances will 
represent 1,000 years of culture. 
</P>
<P>
Cambodian New Year's festivities begin at 9 a.m. tomorrow at Van Nuys 
Recreation Center, 14301 Vanowen St., Van Nuys. Free, but donations are 
requested. For further information: (818) 989-8131.

MEETING ON ARTS CENTER PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal and city officials will hold a public meeting Tuesday regarding a 
proposed cultural center in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will give residents a chance to voice complaints or support for the 
much-debated project. A number of environmental and community groups, including 
the Sierra Club, have opposed construction in the basin's rolling parklands. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important issue in this instance concerns alternative sites. 
The Sierra Club has argued that the cultural center should be built in an urban 
setting such as the Cal State Northridge campus or along Ventura Boulevard. 
Officials said they hope to hear other site suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
All such comments will be included in state and federal environmental reports 
that will be used to determine the cultural center's future. The project is 
subject to approval by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the 
flood-control basin, and the city of Los Angeles, which leases the land. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get all the concerns and controversy on the table," said John 
Westermeier, vice president of the Chambers Group, a consulting firm hired to 
prepare the environmental reports. "It doesn't do us any good to do a report in 
a vacuum and then have the problems hit us later." 
</P>
<P>
A private group called the Cultural Foundation has been working for nine years 
to raise money for Arts Park L.A., an envisioned $70-million complex, and wants 
to sublease 60 acres of basin land. The arts center would include theaters, 
workshops and exhibit spaces. Foundation officials hope that Arts Park would 
lure world-class orchestras and ballet companies to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Times poll, 61% of the Valley residents who responded were in favor 
of Arts Park. But poll results also showed that the community is not eager to 
have the complex built in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. and from 7 to 10 p.m. at the Navy and 
Marine Corps Reserve Center, 6337 Balboa Blvd., Encino. Comments also can be 
sent to Sheila Murphy, Environmental Resources Branch, U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, 300 N. Los Angeles St., Los Angeles, 90012-2325.

UPS AND DOWNS: A week ago Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was all smiles over being 
named to Rolling Stone's environmentalist Hall of Fame, but this week it's bad 
press. . . . The American Spectator, a national conservative journal, called 
Agran in a six-page article the "Evil Emperor of Irvine, California." . . . 
Agran is "a serpent (that) slipped into the garden," the article charges, but 
Agran calls it "desperation journalism." Steve Emmons and David Reyes

In a bold bid to boost its already large HMO membership in Southern 
California,PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. said Thursday that it will make an 
offer to acquire bankrupt Maxicare Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
Financial details of PacifiCare's proposed buyout of the Los Angeles-based 
health maintenance organization were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise offer comes five days before Maxicare will present a disclosure 
statement to the federal bankruptcy court in Santa Ana. The statement's 
approval is crucial for Maxicare's reorganization and expected emergence from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare officials said they would consider the unsolicited offer, but were 
clearly unhappy with its timing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made it clear for more than a year that Maxicare is not for sale, so 
we are, quite frankly, puzzled by the timing of this announcement, which comes 
just two business days before a crucial public hearing on our reorganization 
efforts," said Peter J. Ratican, chairman and chief executive of Maxicare, in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
If consummated, the merger would make Cypress-based PacifiCare one of the 
Southland's largest HMOs with 580,000 members in the region and 956,000 
nationwide. Kaiser Permanente, with more than 2 million members in Southern 
California, is the largest HMO serving the region. 
</P>
<P>
The combination could be a two-edged sword for consumers. Industry analysts 
said the merger could improve the efficiency of the HMO's health-care delivery 
by providing greater resources. But the reduced competition could also mean 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer, said the company had 
informed Ratican of the forthcoming buyout proposal, which would be made by 
this morning. He said the offer was expected to be a starting point for 
extended negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Maxicare would make an excellent strategic addition for 
PacifiCare," Terry Hartshorn, PacifiCare's president and chief executive 
officer, said in a statement. "Maxicare's largest single membership component 
is in California, which also represents our largest geographic concentration of 
membership." 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare officials said that 130,000 of Maxicare's 320,000 members are in 
California, where about 450,000 of PacifiCare's 638,000 members also are 
located. The acquisition would boost PacifiCare's total membership by more than 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare also has HMO operations in Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Louisiana, 
South Carolina and North Carolina. PacifiCare also does business in Oregon, 
Oklahoma, Texas and Washington, and has an insurance subsidiary licensed in 33 
states. 
</P>
<P>
While PacifiCare has prospered as a regional operator, Maxicare expanded 
rapidly as a national firm that sought out large corporate clients looking for 
a single HMO for their scattered employees. But after two acquisitions of 
failing HMOs and two years of losses, Maxicare sought protection in March, 
1989, from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
Ratican said he expects Maxicare to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings later 
this year. While he has an obligation to creditors, stockholders and clients to 
consider any offer, Ratican said he still expects Maxicare "to be an aggressive 
competitor of theirs (PacifiCare) in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare's interest in Maxicare, he said, "is an indication that they think 
this management has turned the company around." 
</P>
<P>
Ratican said he had previous discussions with PacifiCare about possible sale of 
a few Maxicare operations. But those discussions, which ended in March, 1989, 
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
While no financial details were released, Ratican noted that Cigna, a 
diversified insurance company based in Philadelphia, recently announced it 
would pay $777 million to buy Nashville-based Equicor, which has 450,000 
members in 19 HMO plans. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hoops, PacifiCare's chief operating officer, would say only that 
PacifiCare would expect to offer Maxicare's creditors as much as they have been 
promised in Maxicare's plan of reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for creditors and shareholders to receive about $102 million in 
cash and $67 million in notes, common stock and warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that the proposal by PacifiCare was out of character for 
the company, known for its conservative policies. It has produced consistent 
profits and built its membership through internal growth rather than 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"PacifiCare is a very consistent player that usually hits singles and doubles," 
said Larry Selwitz, health-care analyst for Cruttenden &amp; Co., an investment 
banking firm in Newport Beach. "Although they have very good and capable 
management, they usually don't go for home runs." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other HMOs that experienced losses during an industry depression 
several years ago, PacifiCare has reported steady profits since it went public 
in 1985, in part because the company has done well investing its surplus cash. 
</P>
<P>
In its last fiscal year ended Sept. 30, PacifiCare reported earnings of $10.9 
million on revenue of $650.2 million. The company's strong growth has continued 
into 1990, showing first-quarter earnings of $2.9 million, up from $1.1 million 
for the same quarter in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Maxicare in the first nine months of '89 showed a net loss of 
$22.3 million. However, company officials say they have managed to increase the 
company's cash flow by trimming overhead and that they expect Maxicare to 
become profitable in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Both Maxicare and PacifiCare operate similarly in that they contract for 
independent physicians and hospitals to provide service to their members, 
unlike other HMOs that own hospitals and clinics and hire their own medical 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Several industry analysts believe that the proposed merger would give 
PacifiCare an advantage of greater economy of scale, especially in Southern 
California, where they already contract with many of the same physician groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that PacifiCare is not overpaying and that Maxicare has some loyal 
clients, it would be attractive for PacifiCare to buy out the competition," 
said Rae Alperstein, a vice president and health-care analyst with Bateman 
Eichler in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Selwitz of Cruttenden &amp; Co. said that Maxicare, through past 
inefficiencies, has alienated many employers and health-care providers, who he 
believes would welcome a PacifiCare takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been convinced that Maxicare could make it on its own in a 
comeback. The problem with employers and providers has been too deep," Selwitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also said that consumers may suffer if reduced competition triggers a 
premium price spiral. "The implication could be higher prices for employers" 
who contract for group medical insurance, he said.

LOBBYIST FOR VEGAS TRAIN PROJECT CHOSEN; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: THE CONTRACT WILL GO TO ORANGE COUNTY'S INFLUENTIAL AND 
CONTROVERSIAL FRANK MICHELENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A bistate commission overseeing plans for 300-m.p.h. train service between 
Anaheim and Las Vegas is scheduled to award a no-bid consulting contract today 
to Frank Michelena, one of Orange County's most influential and controversial 
lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Taylor, executive director of the 16-member California-Nevada Super Speed 
Ground Transportation Commission, said he personally recommended Michelena to 
panel members, who are scheduled to vote on several consulting contracts today 
at a meeting in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Michelena has proposed raising money from private sources to help fund some of 
the commission's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Michelena has given gifts to members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, 
including board Chairman Don R. Roth, and has helped raise campaign funds for 
them as well while lobbying on behalf of companies that have matters pending 
before county government. 
</P>
<P>
Roth is vice chairman of the commission, which is scheduled to receive bids in 
July from firms interested in building and operating a high-speed train system 
between Anaheim and Las Vegas. Three companies have indicated that they will 
bid on the project and will propose either magnetically levitated or 
wheel-on-track rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
The final project must be approved by both state legislatures, which have 
mandated that construction and operation of the rail system be at private 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said Michelena is scheduled to be hired under a 
$5,000-a-month contract that is to be shared with Sacramento lobbyist Paula 
Treat. She shepherded the bill that created the bistate panel in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the commission's expenses -- totaling several hundred thousand 
dollars -- have been paid out of donations of tax money from the cities of Las 
Vegas and Anaheim, on the premise that administration is separate from 
construction or operation of the planned rail service. 
</P>
<P>
"We're involved with a nonprofit corporation to finance studies and also, 
probably, to make grants to the commission," Michelena said Thursday. The SST 
Super Speed Foundation, he said, will be led by Dave Boren of Huntington Beach, 
who is retired from the bowling alley business. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not raised any money at this point," Michelena said. "We have a lot of 
heavy selling to do." 
</P>
<P>
Michelena said he believes that most commission members want to make all of the 
panel's funding private so that no additional money will be needed from Las 
Vegas, Anaheim or other cities along the proposed route. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Roth said Thursday that the commission does not have to seek 
competitive bidding for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
California Deputy Atty. Gen. Jack Winkler said some public agencies are 
authorized to award no-bid contracts for professional services, but he declined 
to comment specifically on the Treat-Michelena contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any hokeypokey going on," Roth said of the the proposed 
contract. "We have to have money to keep this commission afloat, and we can't 
do it on osmosis." 
</P>
<P>
Roth acknowledged Michelena's extensive political ties to elected officials but 
pointed out that recently Michelena was unsuccessful in attempting to persuade 
the Board of Supervisors to renew the county's contract with a traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
Treat donated $350 to Roth's reelection campaign Nov. 29, 1989, according to 
mandatory political finance reports filed with the county registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Roth listed $140 worth of gifts from Michelena -- lunches and a candy basket -- 
on his mandatory statement of economic interests for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Michelena, a former supervisor's aide, has been questioned by law enforcement 
authorities in a variety of political corruption cases over the years, 
including the successful prosecution of former Anaheim fireworks magnate W. 
Patrick Moriarty. Michelena lobbied for Moriarty both locally and in 
Sacramento. But Michelena has never been charged with wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to be awarded a contract today is Anaheim-based Willdan 
Associates, an engineering firm that contributed $250 to Roth's reelection 
campaign on June 14, 1989. Between 1988 and 1989, the company contributed 
$2,000 combined to two other bistate commission members: state Sen. Bill 
Leonard (R-Redlands) and Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard 
Katz (D-Sepulveda). 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Willdan contract was competitively bid, Taylor said.

FAMILY OF MARINE SLAIN IN '88 WILL URGE REOPENING OF CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of a Marine Corps sergeant killed in a 1988 brawl with two Cal State 
Fullerton football players said Thursday that the family will ask Orange County 
authorities to reopen the case, hinting that new information would support 
their demand for a trial of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be submitting another petition to the district attorney's 
office to reopen the case," Jule E. Bottjer said of the death of her son, El 
Toro Marine Staff Sgt. Richard William Bottjer. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have . . . a concerned citizen who is working with us, and we have some 
new information I'm not at liberty to disclose at this time," she said from the 
family's home on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Marine was beaten to death on April 7, 1988, in a parking lot 
near a Fullerton nightclub during a fistfight with then-CSUF quarterback Carlos 
Siragusa and wide receiver John Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year later, on April 20, 1989, the district attorney's office 
announced it would not file charges against the players, calling Bottjer's 
death "an excusable homicide" brought on by the victim's drunken belligerence. 
</P>
<P>
The players' suspension from the team was lifted. But the family of the dead 
Marine, whose heart was used in Orange County's first heart transplant, vowed 
to pursue the case "until justice was done." 
</P>
<P>
Jule Bottjer said Thursday that the Marine Corps compiled a 500-page report, 
disagreeing with the decision by the district attorney's office. She said the 
military asked that the case be reopened, as she and her husband have done, but 
that after review, prosecutors were satisfied with the original decision 
against prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a body picture of him, and he doesn't have a mark on his hands," the 
55-year-old housewife said. "That seems a little strange if he was the one who 
was instigating the fight and fighting as they said." 
</P>
<P>
Bottjer and his friend, Cpl. Thomas Duran, had scuffled with the athletes 
inside Baxter's, a popular nightspot on State College Boulevard. Bouncers 
kicked them out of the bar, so they took the dispute to a nearby parking lot. 
Witnesses told Fullerton police that it was Bottjer who was insistent on 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Bottjer squared off against both Gibbs and Siragusa and 
threw the first punch, hitting Gibbs in the jaw. Both athletes swung almost 
simultaneously at the Marine, and a coroner's autopsy determined that it was 
the first blow -- behind Bottjer's left ear -- that proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Jule Bottjer, who has become involved with the organization Parents of Murdered 
Children, is unconvinced that her son was the aggressor.

DIANNE KLEIN: LYING ABOUT ONE'S EDUCATION SHOWS A LACK OF CLASS(ES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news is that women are getting the message: Education counts. 
</P>
<P>
Smart is good for your career, your children and great for your self-esteem. 
Smart is savvy. Smart is sexy. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that some women who know this better than most have been 
surprisingly stupid. They lied about their smarts. They said they earned a 
college degree that they did not. Then they played dumb before they were forced 
to 'fess up. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Anne Sheridan, an Irvine councilwoman, is the latest to join this ditsy 
club. I can only guess that she wanted to make herself look good, but, of 
course, the opposite has been the result. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan is hoping to unseat Larry Agran from the Irvine mayor's seat this 
June. Agran graduated cum laude from Harvard University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said Harvard awarded her a degree, too. A master's in nursing. Problem 
is Harvard doesn't award a master's in nursing. 
</P>
<P>
But if it did, Sheridan says today, now that she's been found out, the 
university would have surely bestowed her with just such a crown. She says she 
did graduate work there with a leading open-heart specialist from 1959 to 1961, 
making her a "nursing specialist extraordinaire." 
</P>
<P>
That may well be. Practical experience, of which Sheridan seems to have plenty, 
certainly counts for a lot. 
</P>
<P>
But so does the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sheridan, you may recall, there was California State University 
Chairwoman Marianthi Lansdale of Huntington Beach, who invented a 1959 
associate of arts degree from Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
And before that, Supervisor Harriet Wieder was forced to admit that she 
fabricated a BA in journalism from Wayne State. Wieder had even stuck to the 
claim under oath. 
</P>
<P>
The flap over Wieder and Lansdale has blown over, and neither woman, it seems, 
has suffered any irreparable political harm. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, the only woman among the five supervisors, lost her 1988 congressional 
bid in the wake of the phantom degree brouhaha, but she's still one of Orange 
County's most powerful politicians. She's up for reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale, meanwhile, has refused to give up her position, which pays $100 a 
meeting, despite calls from members of the state Senate, which approved her 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate has passed a bill that would give it the power to remove any 
Marianthi Lansdales of the future, but Lansdale, for now, would be out of its 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
Her colleagues on the Cal State board, all of them political appointees, say 
that is just fine. They think Marianthi's doing a hell of a job. They passed a 
resolution offering her their "full support." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian, who picked Lansdale after she and her husband donated more 
than $100,000 to his campaign, says her lie was a "big mistake," but he hasn't 
asked her to step down. It's unlikely that he will. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a real fine representative for the system," the Duke says. 
</P>
<P>
So what is wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
No harm done, is what many say. Mistakes were made. Mea culpas, albeit 
reluctant ones, have been offered and for the most part, accepted. 
</P>
<P>
What is wrong with this picture is that it is part of a series. It's happening 
time and again, blurring too many lines. 
</P>
<P>
Truth in advertising has become an oxymoron. When a product or a service or a 
politician lives up to the advance billing, people really take note. It is the 
exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the truth just slipped away from these three women, all of them born of a 
time when higher education remained a predominately male domain. They 
considered themselves members of that educational elite. They were smart. They 
deserved a degree. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years -- 25 of them in Wieder's case -- maybe their lie came to seem 
like so much less than it really was. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like I lied about a traffic infraction or a felony or a fraud," 
Lansdale said late last year, when her fib was found out. 
</P>
<P>
These women, it seems, began to perceive themselves as mere accessories, rather 
than perpetrators, of any crime. To blame, they say, was carelessness, or 
campaign workers or the machinations of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
And a crime, of course, this kind of lying is not. Stretching the truth is what 
some call it, fudging, exaggeration or giving the apple an extra shine. It 
happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, Wieder and Lansdale say they have learned from their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
I think we can, too.

WORKERS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

Bright orange signs, traffic cones and flashing yellow lights -- all signs of 
freeway repairs or construction under way -- are frustrating signals for most 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
But to Albert Miranda, they are markers of danger, and occasionally, as on the 
San Diego Freeway on Thursday morning, the construction signs are markers of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda worked for eight years as one of Orange County's 140 California 
Department of Transportation workers, repairing guardrails, replacing signs and 
placing his life on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"You constantly are looking over your shoulder," said Miranda, who now works as 
a spokesman for Caltrans' Orange County office. "You can't step in the wrong 
direction. It's very dangerous. There's nothing out there to protect you but 
the plastic cones and the signs." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's accident, in which a highway maintenance worker was crushed to death 
when a van traveling more than 80 m.p.h. slammed into a parked maintenance 
truck, is an example of the hazardous conditions workers face, Caltrans 
officials note. 
</P>
<P>
The worker's death was the fifth in Orange County since 1980 and the first this 
year, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that no worker deaths occurred in 1989, but there were 
seven fatalities statewide between 1984 and 1988. That is a decrease over the 
previous reporting period between 1979 and 1983, when 17 workers died around 
the state. Between 1974 and 1978, there were 14 fatalities statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans does not keep statistics on the number of injuries suffered, but 
Miranda estimated that hundreds of workers have been hurt over the last 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the number of deaths during the late 1980s is attributed in 
part to the "Give 'em a Brake" television ad campaign that attempted to raise 
awareness about the dangers faced by the highway workers. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the decreasing rate of fatalities is the introduction of 
safety devices, such as concrete barriers and light boards that inform drivers 
of highway conditions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvements, some workers say the freeways are more dangerous 
today than they were 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to go into the middle of traffic to collect objects," said George 
Hays, who worked on Southern California freeways for 21 years and is now 
regional manager of the Orange County Caltrans office. "We wouldn't even think 
of doing that today. . . . Things are a lot more dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said he knew four of the Orange County workers who were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them died when a truck with bad brakes slammed into them on the Santa 
Ana Freeway near Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Another was killed on the Riverside Freeway near Weir Canyon Road when a driver 
lost control of his car after reaching for something on the floorboard, Miranda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth was killed on Laguna Canyon Road when a milk truck hit him on Big Bend 
Curve as the worker attempted to cross the road. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of drivers just aren't alert," Hays said. "They're looking for something 
(in the car), thinking about their children, or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Officials ranked freeway off-ramps and interchanges as the most dangerous areas 
for repair work. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a situation where people are making up their minds about 
where to go at the last minute, you have a hazard," Miranda said.

NEW TASK FORCE WILL EXPLORE RAIL PROJECTS

<P>
Orange County's tollway agencies formed a task force Thursday to explore the 
possibility of installing rail transit systems along the routes of three 
planned toll facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, it is incumbent upon the boards of directors of these agencies 
to examine all aspects of transit," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. 
Hausdorfer. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer and Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa, both directors of the Orange 
County Transportation Corridor Agencies, briefed other board members about 
their recent tour of high-speed rail facilities in West Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
Both mayors said that private firms interested in using the tollway agencies' 
rights of way for rail projects could be tapped for funds that would help 
alleviate the agencies' current cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
The tollways are to be financed with developer fees and toll revenue. But 
pre-construction expenses are exceeding revenue because tolls can't be 
collected until the roads are already in use, officials said. Plans call for 
issuing construction bonds, but officials are attempting to delay such 
financing as long as possible in order to minimize interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, who is a member of a privately funded foundation boosting local and 
regional rail transit projects, said he will meet early next month with Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich to discuss proposals for a high-speed 
monorail service that would loop the Los Angeles-Orange County basin. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan-based HSST Corp. has proposed such a monorail loop, but the firm has 
also demanded concessions on a variety of financial and environmental issues, 
including free rights of way, development rights along monorail routes and 
exclusive franchises in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hausdorfer and Buffa, the rail task force includes Orange County 
supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley, Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, San 
Clemente Councilwoman Holly Veale, Newport Beach Councilman John C. Cox Jr., 
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel E. Young and Tustin Mayor Richard B. Edgar. JEFFREY A.

VOTE ON SUBDIVISIONS SPURS INVESTIGATION

<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that it is 
investigating a possible conflict of interest involving a planning commissioner 
who voted to allow the building of subdivisions while reportedly holding a 
financial interest in the development firm. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna Crandall confirmed Thursday that her office is looking 
into Harold Joseph's connection to Dallas-based Centex Development Corp., but 
declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph owns a San Clemente real estate firm with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with The Times last Friday, Joseph conceded he owned 
$10,000 in Centex stock in November when he voted in favor of allowing the firm 
to build subdivisions to include 476 single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said he wasn't aware that his action was a potential violation of state 
law, which prohibits public officials from voting on issues in which they hold 
a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, when he acknowledged the financial tie, Joseph said: "I wasn't 
trying to do anything illegal." 
</P>
<P>
He said he sold the stock last month when City Clerk Myrna Erway pointed out 
that his ownership might be a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
At least two City Council members said this week that they are pushing for 
Joseph's resignation. But Joseph said he will not make any decisions on his 
future, including his position on the commission when his two-year term expires 
in June, until he returns from vacation later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The matter came to the attention of the district attorney's office last August 
when resident Simon Zervos, a retired Coast Guard officer, filed a complaint 
over a finder's fee that Joseph received last year for leading Centex to 
purchase land in east San Clemente where the developer is now building 398 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jeffrey M. Oderman ruled last year that the commissioner had done 
nothing wrong because Joseph received the money from the property's previous 
owner, Estrella Properties Ltd. Councilman Brian J. Rice said he will seek to 
introduce legislation at the council's May 2 meeting calling for the planning 
commissioner to be removed from the his post. FRANK MESSINA

LIBEL SUIT AGAINST REGISTER IS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge refused Thursday to dismiss a libel suit by Harbor 
Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt against the Orange County Register and two 
reporters over their coverage of a sex and influence scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Register attorney Duffern H. Helsing argued that the lawsuit should be declared 
legally flawed because Schmidt did not allege that the newspaper had actual 
malice when it published a series of stories about him in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam said the lawsuit may stand 
because Schmidt's contention that the newspaper knew it was publishing false 
information is tantamount to an allegation of actual malice. 
</P>
<P>
The Register articles that prompted the lawsuit detailed an investigation of 
Schmidt by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, a judicial watchdog 
agency. He was under scrutiny for various forms of alleged misconduct, 
including giving lenient treatment to two prostitutes in exchange for sex. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the commission rebuked Schmidt for giving preferential treatment 
to a wealthy friend's stepdaughter and making improper campaign contributions 
but cleared him of the accusation that he did legal favors for a prostitute. 
The commission never lodged a formal disciplinary charge against Schmidt over 
his dealings with the other prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Another Harbor Court judge, Brian R. Carter, was also targeted in disciplinary 
proceedings by that agency for similar allegations, but that inquiry was 
dropped when he retired from the bench in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants along with the Register are the two reporters who wrote 
many of the articles: Dan Weikel, who has since joined The Times Orange County 
Edition, and Donna Wares, a Register reporter. The Register has said it 
believes that the lawsuit is without merit. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the Harbor Court investigation were reported in several newspapers, 
including The Times. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

<P>
A 19-year-old man who was shot by a police officer after allegedly pointing a 
gun at him was in stable condition Thursday at Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Orejel of Santa Ana was shot in the chest and leg and suffered scratches 
from a police dog during the incident, which occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday at 
Madison Park in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Orejel was taken into custody on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with 
a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Residents called police just before 8 p.m. to complain about a man who was 
firing a gun in the nearby park, Sgt. Dick Faust said. Two officers responded 
and when they confronted Orejel, he pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun at one of the officers, police said. As the second officer approached, 
the suspect turned and pointed the weapon in his direction. The second officer 
then fired several shots at Orejel, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then tried to run away but was captured a few blocks away with the 
help of a police dog, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the officers involved in the incident were not released. Faust 
said that the officer who fired the shots will probably be placed on a 
three-day administrative assignment, which is customary in shooting cases.

RENEWED BID TO HALT AERIAL SPRAYING FAILS

<P>
Scrambling to breathe life into its legal challenge against malathion spraying, 
the city of Huntington Beach on Thursday tried but failed to have a Sacramento 
County Superior Court judge disqualified from the case because he admitted to 
using the pesticide to eradicate gnats, mosquitoes and fleas from his own back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Deputy City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Delaloza argued that Judge Anthony DeCristoforo Jr. improperly relied on 
his own knowledge of malathion when ruling against the city's request for an 
injunction against the aerial spraying in February. 
</P>
<P>
During that hearing, DeCristoforo said: "I used malathion for years and years 
and years. . . . We have a fairly large back yard, and I spray that all over. I 
don't use a mask; it's never occurred to me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Delaloza asserted that the judge's personal knowledge of malathion "permeated 
the entire hearings" and that "this was the underpinning to the conclusion that 
using malathion was safe." 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Michael J. Virga refused to remove DeCristoforo from 
the case, saying a review of the February hearing yielded the opposite 
conclusion -- that DeCristoforo "conscientiously and impartially decided the 
case" based on the word of experts, and not his own experience as a gardener.

TOURISTS WARNED BY MALATHION FOES

Carrying signs with slogans such as "From the Magic Kingdom to the Tragic 
Kingdom, Who Poisoned Donald and Mickey?", a small band of malathion protesters 
warned tourists to stay indoors during Thursday night's spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland, which is not in the spray zone, would be open until midnight, and 
the protesters were worried that tourists might be walking back to hotels 
during the spraying that started at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to alert them that it isn't OK, despite what the hotels are 
telling them," said William Whaley, a Stanton resident whose home is in the 
spray zone. He was picketing with his two daughters outside the Anaheim 
Marriott and Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The two dozen protesters complained that Disneyland-area hotels had not 
adequately informed guests of Thursday night's spraying. Some hotels, such as 
the Marriott, do provide patrons with information sheets, but a number do not, 
the protesters said. 
</P>
<P>
The response of tourists to the protests was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish (the hotel) would have given us something on it," said Mike Lonnemann 
of Kentucky, who was staying at the Hilton with his wife and two children. "We 
could have made plans to go to dinner a little earlier and then stayed inside 
the rest of the evening." 
</P>
<P>
But most hotel guests who strolled past the protesters said an earlier warning 
about the spraying would not have altered their plans much. 
</P>
<P>
A Disneyland spokesman said the park did not inform guests of the spraying just 
south of the theme park's borders and does not have a plan for doing so if the 
spray zone eventually includes the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes, we'll talk about it," said Bob Roth, a Disneyland 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday night spraying coincides with the expansion of the North County 
spraying into the Diamond Bar and Walnut area. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters said about 10 people also picketed briefly outside Disneyland 
Wednesday night to inform tourists of the upcoming spraying. LISA MASCARO

POSTSCRIPT: 'OBSTETRIC DIVERSION' AT UCI DELIVERED CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The announcement came without fanfare, on a quiet Friday in June. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to county officials and other hospitals, administrators at UCI 
Medical Center declared that their maternity ward was often so crowded that it 
had become unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
So, the letter explained, the hospital was implementing a new policy called 
"obstetrical diversion." Whenever both the maternity ward and emergency room 
were full, UCI security guards would meet women "in active labor" just outside 
the hospital, advise them that conditions were unsafe and suggest they have 
their babies somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
That June 2 notice touched off a furor. 
</P>
<P>
County legislators and health care advocates expressed alarm that a Medi-Cal 
hospital might be turning poor, pregnant women, many of them Latinas, into the 
street. And state and federal officials, questioning whether the unprecedented 
diversion policy was legal, launched separate investigations. 
</P>
<P>
But by September the investigators decided UCI's policy was not illegal. By 
then, hospital leaders such as Dr. Thomas J. Garite, chairman of obstetrics and 
gynecology, had made it clear that no woman would actually be turned away. If 
she insisted on having her baby at the medical center after guards talked to 
her during a several-hours-long "diversion," she could still deliver at UCI -- 
and many women did just that, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly a year and 60 separate diversions later, health care experts -- 
even some who dislike the policy -- say the controversial move has been a 
catalyst for change, focusing attention throughout Orange County on the 
difficulty that poor, pregnant women face in finding obstetrical care. 
</P>
<P>
The diversion policy was "the sparkplug" that got politicians, doctors, county 
officials, civic activists and hospital leaders working together much of last 
year on this problem, said Herbert Rosenzweig, director of medical services for 
the County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Garite agreed: "First and foremost it raised consciousness to the problem in 
the entire community. I think very few people knew there was a problem" -- 
severe overcrowding in a major Medi-Cal hospital's maternity ward as well as a 
shortage of obstetrical beds around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Garite, Rosenzweig and other health experts also ticked off a list of events 
that resulted directly or indirectly from the diversion policy. 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes commissioned a study on Orange County's obstetrical 
capacity. That report, released last month, revealed a countywide shortage of 
maternity beds and warned that rich and poor women alike may face crowded 
delivery rooms and rising infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
State officials last June bent their rules, allowing AMI Medical Center of 
Garden Grove to have the first "obstetrics-only" Medi-Cal contract in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Because of low reimbursement rates and other complaints, Garden Grove's doctors 
were unwilling to accept a Medi-Cal contract serving all indigent patients. But 
they were willing to accept Medi-Cal maternity patients -- and relieve crowding 
at nearby UCI. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's maternity ward is still crowded but its census has declined steadily 
since last June. Built for 250 deliveries a month, it handled 396 births in 
March, down from 558 last June. "Our census went down because Garden Grove is 
taking 150 patients a month," said medical center director Mary A. Piccione. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury in March reported that low-income pregnant women 
have difficulty getting both prenatal and delivery services. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the situation at UCI as well as to aggressive lobbying by United 
Way's Health Care task force, county supervisors set up a Perinatal Task Force 
to study problems in access to health care for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors in March recommended that part of the county's allotment from a new 
state tobacco tax should go for services to low-income pregnant women, 
including $2.3 million to start two birthing centers, facilities for low-risk 
mothers that are to open in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, some people are still unhappy with UCI's "diversions," calling 
the policy of sending security guards to meet pregnant women "insensitive," 
even "inept." Since last June, 187 women have been advised that UCI is unsafe 
and 38 have gone elsewhere, according to medical center statistics. The most 
recent diversion, on Tuesday, lasted 2 1/2 hours and two pregnant women chose 
to enter the hospital anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But Garite is convinced that diversion was UCI's only recourse. When the policy 
began, the obstetrical ward had been severely overloaded for four straight 
months and his staff was ready to quit, Garite said. He said he "anguished" 
over the decision, worrying that if a woman left UCI for another hospital, her 
delivery would involve "bad results. It has not happened, to my knowledge," 
Garite said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, "I was worried about the way I would be perceived. I'm probably 
as strong an advocate for indigent patient care as you'll find. But the 
perception was that we were doing this because of (fiscal) problems at UCI and 
trying to get rid of poor people." 
</P>
<P>
That was simply not true, Garite said. He added: "Sometimes you have to do 
what's right regardless of what people think of you."

EX-DETAINEE TELLS OF TIME IN PADDED ROOM

<P>
Testifying in a soft voice and occasionally weeping, an 18-year-old woman 
described Thursday how she was carried, kicking and screaming, into a padded 
room at Juvenile Hall during an angry outburst there three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, identified in court only as Letycia H., was the first former 
Juvenile Hall detainee to take the stand in a class-action lawsuit challenging 
a host of procedures there, including putting adolescents in "rubber rooms" and 
tying their arms and legs to a bed with soft cloth restraints when they are 
deemed to be out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Letycia said her August, 1987, outburst began after staff members discontinued 
a food-service job she held at Juvenile Hall -- a benefit doled out to the few 
who "were good," she said -- and ordered her to move from her dormitory-style 
accommodation with other girls to a single room in another unit of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Angry, the 15-year-old insisted on an explanation and got none. When she 
refused to move out of her room, several staffers picked her up and carried her 
to her new room, Letycia said. She screamed and pounded the door with her fists 
and feet. No one tried to calm her down, she said. Instead, five minutes later, 
three or four staff members came in, handcuffed her and carried her, kicking 
and yelling, to the padded room, Letycia said. 
</P>
<P>
"They took off my shoes and put me in the room, face down on the mattress on 
the floor," she said. "They took off the handcuffs and told me I had to stay 
there until I calmed down. . . . I hit the walls and screamed. I was still 
upset.

<P>
"I didn't feel I needed to be in there. It made me feel like I really did 
something wrong," she said, crying softly. 
</P>
<P>
Letycia, dressed in a blue and white suit with her black hair smoothed into a 
ponytail, testified that all she wanted was an explanation for why she was 
being taken off food-service duty and moved out of her room with the other 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
When she asked to use the restroom, staffers responded "that there was a little 
drain in the floor somewhere," Letycia said. She added that she was too 
embarrassed to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Letycia, formerly of Garden Grove, said in an interview that she was in 
Juvenile Hall for several months in 1987 for giving a false name to a police 
officer and for leaving the facility before she was officially released. She 
had been there at least once before, for possessing a hypodermic needle. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, Kenneth Kasdan, an attorney for the county, portrayed her 
as a malcontent who filed flurries of grievances over her treatment at the 
hall.

CAMPUS SECURITY BEEFED UP AFTER ABDUCTION;

Administrators at Van Buren Elementary School stepped up campus security on 
Thursday and offered counseling services to students unnerved by the brief 
abduction of 9-year-old David Christie, who was held at gunpoint by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Faye Reed, 30, of Yorba Linda, who lives with her mother a block from 
the grade school, was scheduled to be arraigned today in Municipal Court in 
Fullerton on charges of kidnaping, assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a 
.22-caliber handgun on school property. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested Wednesday afternoon for allegedly grabbing David and taking 
him from the school to an adjacent park. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute standoff ended peacefully when David persuaded her to let him go, 
police said. The semiautomatic pistol that was confiscated from Reed was 
registered to her, Placentia Police Lt. Chuck Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a number of phone calls from parents on Thursday, school officials 
posted five extra administrators and teachers on the school grounds during 
recesses and kept an eye on the park, from where Reed apparently entered the 
school, Principal Ken Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just to make sure the kids know they're safe and everything's fine," 
Lorge said, adding that David returned to class on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The extra staffing will continue at least through today and possibly next week, 
Lorge said. He said, however, that the school has no plans to erect additional 
fencing around the small campus to prevent a recurrence of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the Placentia Unified School District schools have public 
parks next to them, Supt. James Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not feasible to fence them. . . . There's no way to completely 
prevent people from getting on campus," Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Reed was taken into custody, six school counselors were sent to 
the grade school to listen to anxious students and calm their jangled nerves, 
Lorge said. The counselors were also available all day Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know why someone would do that," Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them were nervous, as you'd expect," Lorge said. "But my general 
impression is they are handling it pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, David was a celebrity of sorts, retelling the incident to classmates 
all day long. 
</P>
<P>
"David said that he didn't even have time to play today because people kept 
asking him to tell them what happened," Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police released little information about Reed, who was being held 
Thursday without bail in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock said that investigators on Thursday still were trying to determine a 
motive. Reed apparently does not know David or any member of his family and has 
no criminal record, Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, a part-time Disneyland employee since 1987, also had a clean employment 
record, said one personnel officer who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Several longtime neighbors said that they were shocked by the news of the 
abduction, and described Reed as a friendly person who liked children. 
</P>
<P>
"She has always been friendly to my kids," said next-door neighbor Kim 
Zamarion. "I know she wouldn't hurt that boy." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Ostrling, another neighbor, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"She is all-around super nice," Ostrling said. "She is not violent. Maybe she 
just needs some help." 
</P>

TEAM'S IOWA TRIP IS ALL ACADEMIC; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: THE NATIONAL DECATHLON TO MEASURE STUDENTS' SMARTS STARTS TODAY 
AND LAGUNA HILLS SQUAD HAS BEEN FORGOING FUN TO CONCENTRATE ON STUDIES.

<P>
Sequestered on the 16th floor of the Marriott Hotel, members of the Laguna 
Hills High School academic decathlon team probably feel more like prisoners 
than highly touted whiz kids. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a reason for the team's isolation. The nine-member squad, which 
last month won the California academic decathlon crown, launches its quest 
today against championship-caliber competitors from 38 other states for the 
title of America's smartest teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
And to prepare for this grueling mental challenge, coaches Kathy Lane and Roger 
Gunderson have kept the Laguna Hills "decathletes" under wraps and close to 
their books. 
</P>
<P>
Since the team's arrival here, Gunderson and Lane have relentlessly drilled the 
squad, the first Orange County team to reach the U.S. Academic Decathlon finals 
in 11 years. The team members' hotel rooms have been transformed into makeshift 
classrooms, and Gunderson's booming voice can be heard from behind closed 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
"What type of character is the same at the end of the story as the beginning?" 
Gunderson asked in a rapid-fire staccato during one of the daylong study 
sessions this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Static!" the nine-man team shouted back in unison. 
</P>
<P>
The intense practice sessions are by design. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be plugging up every area that needs to be plugged," Lane said 
after the team finished a round of morning studies. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge, Lane said, is not preparing the team for the 10 academic 
areas that will be tested during the competition. The toughest thing, she said, 
has been keeping the team focused on its mission, which is not an easy task in 
a hotel where there are more than 300 other teen-agers from 38 other states. 
</P>
<P>
That means only brief breaks for meals and recreation to clear their heads. It 
also means finding new ways to keep preparation drills -- which start at 8:30 
a.m. and typically extend into the evening -- interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Like most teen-agers, new sights and attractions can indeed be distracting. 
Before the start of study sessions Wednesday afternoon, Lane was forced to 
search the hotel for two stragglers who were late for class. She found them in 
the hotel's video game parlor. 
</P>
<P>
But the boys' need for relaxation is understandable -- preparing for this 
weekend's competition has been draining. This has not been a sightseeing trip 
as team members discovered almost from the moment they landed in the Iowa 
capital. They hit the books -- lots of great, big books -- upon arriving 
Tuesday night. And the pace has been full throttle ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning has consisted of individual study in their rooms, followed by 
group lessons. On Wednesday, for example, they watched a half-hour filmstrip 
shown on the wall of Lane's room on the lives and works of authors Richard 
Wright and Sinclair Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Other exercises have included a 50-word literary quiz, followed by a strategy 
session on writing essays, the group's strong point. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure of getting ready for a prestigious championship is nothing new for 
the Laguna Hills squad. Todd Faurot, a junior, said he spent his Easter Week 
vacation studying up to four hours a night to prepare for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, Faurot and his teammates will find out whether they crammed 
enough. Testing starts today with essays on Native American history -- the 
subject that pushed Laguna Hills over the top in the state championships in 
March. Then contestants will be individually interviewed by judges who are free 
to question the students on any subject. The day ends with a speech contest. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's competition opens with exams in social science, science, math and 
economics, language and literature, and fine arts. It concludes with the Super 
Quiz, a "Jeopardy!"-like game in which students compete directly against other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Teams will be split into groups of three, based on grade-point average. For 
Laguna Hills, the "A" group is made up of team captain Jeff McCombs, a senior, 
juniors Jay Kim and Ryan Sakamoto. The "B" group consists of Faurot and seniors 
Mike Lee and Jack Dietz, and the "C" group comprises seniors Julian Kingston, 
Jeff DeWit and Bill Fischer.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS SLUGGER HAS POP IN HIS BAT, SPEED TO BOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The name is the same, and so is the game. But that is where the similarities 
end. George Scott III, who plays outfield for Cal State Dominguez Hills, is 
indeed the son of George Scott, the one-time American League home run champion 
who hit 271 homers during a 14-year major league career. 
</P>
<P>
When his dad played he was known as the Boomer because he weighed 225 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Scott, a trimmed-down version of his dad, was a track standout in 
high school who didn't begin playing baseball until his senior year. He has a 
sprinter's speed and is vying for the Toros' lead in stolen bases. "We list him 
at 180 pounds but he's probably closer to 165," said a school official. He's 
known to teammates as the Baby Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott grew up in Massachusetts while his father gained fame with the Boston Red 
Sox. After playing at New Bedford High in the Boston area, he attended 
Miami-Dade's community college, where he stole 53 bases in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
His parents divorced and his mother, Malvine, became engaged to an employee at 
Dominguez Hills. Scott followed last summer and showed up as a walk-on for 
baseball, a pleasant surprise for Coach George Wing. 
</P>
<P>
Wing described Scott as "electrifying . . . George's speed is an intimidating 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
Scott agrees that speed is his game. "My dad is a power hitter," he said. "He's 
a home-run hitter and an RBI man. I'm a leadoff batter and known more for my 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
But Scott had a power-hitter's swing when he arrived at Dominguez Hills, a 
problem Wing has tried to correct. The work to shorten his swing is paying 
dividends, as Scott is hitting .349, has a team-high 52 hits and has stolen 14 
bases, one behind team leader Robert Campbell. Thirteen of Scott's 22 RBIs have 
come with two outs. The Toros are 13-19 going into tonight's game at Cal State 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wing has also worked with Scott, a right-hand batter, on switch-hitting. He 
hasn't tried it in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is making a name for himself in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
and, he hopes, beyond. If he follows his father's footsteps, it will be done 
with speed, not strength. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount basketball standout Bo Kimble made a strong showing at the 
Orlando Classic, an all-star series in Florida last week showcasing college 
seniors for pro scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble was named to the all-tournament team after leading in steals. He also 
got a chance to play point guard in a practice to show he is comfortable in a 
set-up game, which Loyola has rarely played. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to show scouts a universal game, everything but offense," Kimble 
said. "I didn't concentrate on scoring at all. I think I surprised some scouts, 
that I can play good halfcourt man-to-man defense. They never had a chance to 
see me play that way." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble managed to rank among the top scorers, leading the West team in two of 
three games. He played with a sprained left thumb suffered in the semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who led the nation in scoring with a 35.7-point average and had an 
outstanding NCAA tournament, didn't need to play in the all-star series. But 
Kimble and his agent, David Spencer, thought it would enhance his standing for 
the June draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I guaranteed myself a lottery pick," Kimble said. "I moved up in the 
draft. It worked out to my best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who recruited Kimble out of high school for USC, said: "I don't think 
there's any question he helped himself. It was a chance for people to see him 
in a more normal-type game than a Loyola game. One (NBA) general manager told 
me, 'You've got the best guy here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Musician P.R. Paul, a fan of Loyola basketball, has written a song called 
"Hank's House" as a tribute to the late Hank Gathers. The folk-style song is 
available on cassette by mail as a fund-raiser for the Hank Gathers Memorial 
Fund that was established by the school. 
</P>
<P>
The tape is available for $4.75 from: Hank's House, P.O. Box 83413, Los Angeles 
90083. Paul said all money will go to the Gathers fund. 
</P>
<P>
Former El Camino College and University of Nevada-Las Vegas soccer standout Dom 
Militello got his pro career off to a good start on Friday the 13th. Playing in 
the Salt Lake City Sting's opening game, the Palos Verdes native scored three 
goals in a 3-1 victory over the New Mexico Chiles. The Sting plays in the 
American Pro Soccer League, which includes the South Bay-based L.A. Heat. 
Militello, who was the South Coast Conference player of the year and a 
community college All-American at El Camino, recently graduated from UNLV, 
where he helped the Rebels win a Big West Conference championship and qualify 
for the NCAA playoffs for two consecutive seasons. Militello will play locally 
on July 13 when the Sting visits the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Some former Dominguez Hills players also made their debut in the league last 
week. Joe Flanagan is playing for the Heat, Chris Wilson and Lucky Temisanren 
for the California Emperors, who play at University of Redlands, and Glen 
Strachan for the San Diego Nomads. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the week: The Loyola men's programs are at an all-time best. Last week, 
the basketball team was ranked eighth in the final poll, the baseball team was 
ranked ninth and the volleyball team was ranked eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola outfielder Tony Kounas was named West Coast Conference baseball player 
of the week after hitting three home runs in a game at San Francisco and 
knocking in nine runs in a three-game sweep of the University of San Francisco. 
. . . Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai signed two players, 
trying to improve the Toros' inside game. Albert Kiilehua, a 6-foot-7 graduate 
of Leuzinger High in 1988, and 6-8 Alex del Hierro of Bell High, will join two 
redshirt Division I transfers, guard Keith Billingslea from Northern Arizona 
and Harbor College and swingman Brian Jones of Cal State Long Beach. . . . 
Dominguez Hills softball players Jennifer Boen and Melissa Punch are battling 
for the team leadin batting. Boen started the week at .387 and Punch was at 
.383. Punch has a team-high 22 RBIs, two ahead of Maria Romero.

NOTHING UNDERHANDED ABOUT EL CAMINO PITCHER; 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL: SOPHOMORE CANDY CARRICO, WHO PITCHED A NO-HITTER ON WEDNESDAY, USES A 
VARIETY OF PITCHES TO KEEP OPPONENTS GUESSING.

Candy Carrico, a sophomore right-hander from El Camino College, has enjoyed 
first-place finishes, undefeated seasons, most-valuable-player awards and 
colorful nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
But this season the Warriors have struggled to produce runs and Carrico's 
record, a modest 17-15-1, reflects that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a rough year," Carrico said. "But that's not going to stop me. I 
just came off of three years where my team took first place, and I still love 
playing softball. It's just that you can't win them all." 
</P>
<P>
Last season El Camino went 16-0 in the South Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Warriors and Carrico recaptured some of that lost magic in a 
game against Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
Carrico had 10 strikeouts en route to a no-hitter and a 12-0 Warrior victory. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved El Camino's SCC record to 7-6 and might have improved 
Carrico's chances of getting back her nickname. 
</P>
<P>
When she attended Leuzinger High, she was known as "Nurse K" for her ability to 
strike out batters. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was kind of dumb," Carrico said. "It's nice to get publicity, 
but I was embarrassed by all of that." 
</P>
<P>
This season she has 164 strikeouts, no wild pitches, 38 walks and a 0.81 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel that I'm really good," she said. "I see myself as average. I'm 
not Division I or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's most valuable player in the SCC is popular among other athletes at 
El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of nice when you go somewhere and people say, 'Oh, you're the 
pitcher. I read about you,' " Carrico said. "That happens all the time at work 
or at school. Just the other day I was having lunch in a restaurant and it 
happened. It's really fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never let it go to my head because I know I could be doing so much 
better than I am right now in pitching, hitting, everything." 
</P>
<P>
To opposing hitters, Carrico's abilities appear unlimited. She mixes pitches -- 
a curveball, drop pitch, changeup, screwball and fastball -- to keep batters 
off guard. 
</P>
<P>
But with her community college career coming to an end, she is waiting for an 
offer to continue her athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
She views the differences between a baseball and softball player's career 
options as unjust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is totally unfair," Carrico said. "They are playing and doing 
exactly what they want to do and getting paid for it. We put in just as much 
time and effort as the guys do, but we can't get paid." 
</P>
<P>
Carrico is considering a career related to physical education, like teaching 
the handicapped to play sports, but said she hasn't given much thought to 
anything unrelated to softball. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're out there on the mound, you're living for that day, for that 
moment," she said. "You're not worried about the future." 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that her future isn't far from the field, especially since her 
father, mother and two sisters have ties to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Jim Carrico, has coached the West Torrance High softball team for 
the past five seasons and a summer team, the Torrance Lightning, that Candy 
pitched on for eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Her oldest sister, Becky, 24, pitched for Leuzinger and Wendy, 18, is currently 
a starting pitcher there. Carrico's mother rotates between her daughters' 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Carrico has started every game for the Warriors this season. She maintains an 
optimistic attitude despite the team's struggles this season. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make the best out of everything, and even though we're not winning 
as much as we would like, you can't let things like that stop you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The team's offense shoulders the load for the Warriors' rough season, but 
Carrico has been among the top three hitters, averaging .273. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out there to have fun," Carrico said. "The minute you stop having fun and 
allow all those things to get in your way, you know it's time to stop playing."

NEW PRESIDENT TO TAKE HELM AT MEDSTONE 
</P>

Medstone International Inc. on Thursday named Richard Ferrari as president and 
chief operating officer of the Irvine-based biotechnology company. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari, a former executive vice president of ADAC Laboratories in Milpitas, 
Calif., replaces acting president Jack Olshansky, who has filled the job on an 
interim basis since November. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone is a manufacturer of lithotripters, which are sophisticated shock-wave 
devices designed to disintegrate kidney stones without surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's appointment is the latest in a series of top management changes at 
the Irvine company. Olshansky, a representative of Medstone's largest 
shareholder, Montgomery Medical Ventures, was appointed to the president's post 
following the resignation last August of company co-founder Richard L. Penfil. 
</P>
<P>
Penfil and Medstone's vice president for regulatory affairs, P. Joshua Burke, 
left the company amid continuing problems in gaining Food and Drug 
Administration approval to use Medstone's lithotripters as a non-surgical 
alternative for treating gallstones. The FDA has approved the machines only for 
treating kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Medstone announced a net loss of $602,471 on revenue of $4.2 
million for the first quarter ending March 31, compared to earnings of $358,534 
on revenue of $4.1 million in the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone Chairman Freeman Rose blamed the lower earnings on efforts to reduce 
corporate expenses and on legal costs associated with a pending class-action 
shareholder lawsuit against Medstone. The suit alleges that Medstone withheld 
adverse information about its prospects in order to inflate its stock price.

MJQ, KRONOS: 2 SIDES OF THE SAME MIRROR; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: YOUNGER QUARTET SAYS THAT IN WATCHING THE FOUR OLDER MASTERS, IT IS 
'ALMOST SEEING OURSELVES IN 30 YEARS' TIME.' THEY PLAY IN ORANGE COUNTY SUNDAY.

It seems an unlikely pairing: the jazz combo that, in the '50s, began donning 
tuxedos to bring their music into the concert halls, and the string quartet 
that, sans formal wear, went beyond the usual classical repertoire to perform 
jazz, ethnic and experimental compositions, even rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the Modern Jazz Quartet and the 12-year-old Kronos Quartet don't 
see it that way. In fact, according to John Lewis, musical director of the MJQ, 
and David Harrington, violinist and spokesman for Kronos, rehearsing together 
last week was much like looking into a mirror, a mirror that can see across the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"They kind of remind me of ourselves when we began nearly 40 years ago," Lewis 
said last week during a phone conversation from his home in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Added Harrington from San Francisco, "Each of us in Kronos feels we've been 
watching these four older masters and thinking that, in a way, we're almost 
seeing ourselves in 30 years' time or so." 
</P>
<P>
The MJQ (pianist Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Percy Heath and 
drummer Connie Kay) and Kronos (violinists Harrington and John Sherba, violist 
Hank Dutt and cellist Joan Jeanrenaud) began a joint West Coast tour todayin 
Eugene, Ore. They play Saturday at UCLA's Royce Hall and Sunday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Each of the quartets will play 
individual programs, then combine forces on three John Lewis compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Both men say the concept was a natural. "I first heard the Modern Jazz Quartet 
when I was 15 or 16 years old and, since then, I've admired the beauty of their 
ensemble playing and the feeling they project," Harrington explained. "(The 
idea of playing together) actually developed very organically, evolving from 
them being a quartet that's been together for nearly 40 years and Kronos 
desiring to have that kind of longevity." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who first proposed it," said Lewis. "It just happened. It's a 
natural idea." 
</P>
<P>
Their relationship actually goes back almost 10 years to the 1981 Monterey Jazz 
Festival, when Lewis composed a piece for the string quartet and performed it 
with them. "After that," Harrington continued, "we started running into each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been following their career since that time at Monterey," Lewis said. 
"When we first met, it was the beginning of their career and the direction they 
have since developed. I have great admiration and affection for them." 
</P>
<P>
Kronos has always had an ear for jazz. The group has collaborated with drummer 
Max Roach and, more recently, saxophonist Steve Lacy, with whom they'll tour 
Europe this summer. Their recorded works include an album of Thelonious Monk 
compositions with bassist Ron Carter, and one of the music of Bill Evans with 
guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Eddie Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
The MJQ has long had a reputation as an ensemble willing to transcend musical 
categories. Their album "Third Stream," released in 1960, used as its title the 
term coined in the late '50s by composer, conductor and critic Gunther Schuller 
to describe the jazz/classical music then being written by Lewis and others. 
Two of the recording's pieces involved the Beaux Arts String Quartet, including 
Lewis' "Sketch," a piece that Kronos and the MJQ rehearsed last week in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups will open with individual programs that neatly capsulize their 
directions. Kronos will perform compositions written for them by new-music 
composer John Zorn, Hungary's Istvan Marta and Ugandan Justinian Tamusuza, as 
well as an arrangement of Jimi Hendrix's "Red House." The MJQ will present a 
selection of numbers from George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" and a pair of Duke 
Ellington compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pieces the two quartets have scheduled to perform together is Lewis' 
"A Day in Dubrovnik" in three movements, which can be heard on "Three Windows," 
the MJQ's 1987 album with the New York Chamber Symphony. Gary Giddins, author 
and jazz critic for New York's Village Voice, has said that the piece "is as 
close to authentic romance as late 20th-Century music dares to get." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington is looking forward to the tour. "The way Connie Kay lays back on the 
beat, the way Percy Heath fits in with us, it's very civilized, gentlemanly. 
Their 'quartetness' is something very special. They've found the best way for 
them to make music and to put the pieces together. The way they relate to each 
other is something we admire very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The Modern Jazz Quartet and the Kronos Quartet play Sunday at 8 p.m. at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Tickets: $10 to $29. Information: (714) 556-2787.

LASZLO &amp; GARY PUT PARODY TO MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Instead of dropping coins into a jukebox at their booth, a duo who parody 
Top-40 songs can create their own tunes at a Sherman Oaks '50s-style diner. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Duke of Earl' could be 'Quart of Oil,' " says Gary Kleinman, 36, who looks 
like a skinny version of actor Ted Danson. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dream Lover' would be 'No Such Thing,' " says Kleinman's partner in parody, 
Charles Laszlo, "and 'Chantilly Lace' could be 'I Lost the Race,' for the L.A. 
Marathon." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary, who became known for their parodies in 1985 with 
"Su-Sushi-O," a takeoff on Phil Collins' "Sussudio," are anticipating another 
hit during National Secretary's Week, which begins Monday. "My Boss Is Lazy," a 
parody of the Fine Young Cannibals' song "She Drives Me Crazy," is being 
considered for morning-drive play on local contemporary and rock music stations 
such as KQLZ-FM (100.3). The parody already has aired on KLSX-FM's (97.1) "The 
Dr. Demento Show," as well as that show's nationally syndicated version. 
Between gulps of a chocolate malt, Laszlo, a 36-year-old Reseda resident with 
the rapid-fire wit of a teen-age class clown, explains the plight of morning 
drivers. "People drive and think, 'I've only got 26 years, eight months and 
three days before retirement, I've got to pay electric bills, etc.' We want 
people to laugh instead." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can identify with this song," adds Gary, who lives in Canoga Park. "I 
don't care how high up the ladder you are, you think you have a boss that is 
lazy." 
</P>
<P>
The song features hapless employee Doodlesby, whose voice reminds one of Radar 
O'Reilly, talking with his employer, Mr. Calhoun. The belligerent boss demands 
that Doodlesby work out for him as well as fax his briefcase. Lyrics include: 
"He's a lazy dweeb/ He wrote the book/ He needs two desks/ One for his foot." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Demento, a.k.a. Barry Hansen, praised the song and its creators. "It's a 
good song, and the response to it has been good," he said. "I put Laszlo &amp; 
Gary in the class of professional jobs. I get all kinds of songs sent to me, 
like people who just sing along with Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary record all parodies from scratch, rather than recording over 
someone else's music, which is why "My Boss Is Lazy" took about 50 hours 
instead of about four to produce. They write their pieces together. Laszlo 
performs the character voices, and Gary handles the music and singing voices. 
Occasionally, putting together parodies drives them to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
"One Sunday, we were doing a parody and needed the sound of a Mack truck," Gary 
says. "We needed the sound effect by Monday morning. We followed a Mack truck 
for 90 minutes down the freeway, trying to get him to blow his horn. He finally 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
The two got together in 1978 when Detroit-native Laszlo -- who majored in 
radio, TV and film production at Wayne State University -- answered an ad Gary 
placed in a magazine. He moved west to create a radio commercial with Gary, who 
earned a bachelor's degree in finance from Cal State Northridge in 1974. They 
wrote radio jingles and performed as stand-up comics until 1985, when they 
decided to concentrate solely on song parodies. Since radio stations do not pay 
them for their work, they also have day jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't tell you what they are," Laszlo says. "But we're either waiters or 
corporate executives." 
</P>
<P>
The key to a successful parody, both agree, is an excessive familiarity with a 
popular song. "It should be a hit record that stations have played almost too 
much," Gary says. "Listeners can sing the lyrics, and then you hit them with 
something funny." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary are preparing their first record album, which will combine 
parodies of popular songs with original creations. "We'd never do an album of 
all originals," Gary says. "They'd have to be exceptionally funny, since they 
aren't familiar." Gary says that three small pop/rock/urban record companies 
are interested in making the album. 
</P>
<P>
One song scheduled to be included, "I'm a Sensitive '90s Guy," a pop takeoff of 
Christine Lavin's "Sensitive New Age Guys," parodies the touchy-feely crystal 
age. "I like to cry at weddings/I think Rambo is upsetting," the song broods. 
</P>
<P>
And once they exhaust Top-40 songs and their original ideas, what will Laszlo 
&amp; Gary parody? "Probably marching bands and sound effects," Gary says. 
</P>
<P>
But his partner has other ideas. "Sports fishermen and parodies with 
subtitles," says Laszlo.

SINGLE LIFE: BEING 52 IS NO REASON TO GIVE UP ON ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathryn, as I shall call her, a widow for five years, wrote in response to a 
recent Single Life column. In her letter, she shares her thoughts, feelings and 
memories -- sparked, she said, by something I had written. 
</P>
<P>
I treasured the fact that she would write to a relative stranger about the 
success of her marriage and about the pain she feels being older and single. 
</P>
<P>
She reminisces about romantic evenings with her husband, recalling their mutual 
love of classical music and good wine. Her husband was a cultured, intellectual 
man who had always allowed her the freedom to be herself, she says. She 
continues to enjoy concerts and good books, and her long teaching career 
continues to stimulate and satisfy her. She adds that she is blessed with 
loving children and strong friendships. But she longs to love again. She feels, 
though, that at 52, she is "out of the running." 
</P>
<P>
"No man would consider me when there are such lovely younger women around," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
This woman, obviously bright and talented, feels rejected by what she sees as a 
youth-oriented culture that ignores wisdom and reliability of a woman like her 
in favor of the snap, crackle and pop of someone whose main asset is a young, 
hard body. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn has given up. She gives herself little hope of meeting someone with 
whom she can share the balance of her life. 
</P>
<P>
That's a tragedy. Everywhere we turn, we are bombarded with images of youth and 
of the desirability of recapturing one's youth, of striving for physical -- not 
intellectual or spiritual -- perfection. Cultures of the Far East have long 
recognized the value of their older, wiser citizens; these people are 
respected, even revered. European society dignifies its elders. But our 
woefully shortsighted culture routinely dismisses those who have attained a 
certain age. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, not every man is obsessed with younger women. Some say that they 
find they have little in common with young women, that they prefer partners 
closer to their own ages. Further, many of them cherish the outer as well as 
the inner beauty of their female contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Growing older in a culture such as ours may not be fun, but it is inevitable. 
It should not become an excuse to avoid the challenge of finding someone to 
love. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, regardless of age, needs to be loved. Being loved, however, requires 
that we first believe in ourselves and expect the best. We may not always get 
what we deserve in life, but we do get what we expect. 
</P>
<P>
If what we expect is love, then love will find us -- at any age.

LAWMAKER SEEKS TO LEGALIZE CHARITY RAFFLES; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: A CHANGE IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE GAMES IS 
PROPOSED AFTER AN OXNARD PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL'S FUND-RAISER IS DECLARED ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Carpinteria Assemblyman Jack O'Connell took action Thursday to aid a private 
Catholic high school in Oxnard that canceled its annual raffle recently after 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's office declared it a violation of state 
gambling laws. 
</P>
<P>
In response to an outcry from parents and school officials, O'Connell 
introduced legislation that would place on the November ballot an amendment to 
the state Constitution that would allow nonprofit and charitable groups to 
operate raffles. 
</P>
<P>
The raffle, which has been held for 20 years at Santa Clara High School, was 
scrapped after Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory W. Brose wrote an 
April 4 letter declaring the school's spring fiesta raffle violated state 
gambling laws. 
</P>
<P>
The raffle had raised up to $60,000 each year for the school, according to 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office issued a formal opinion in April, 1988, 
concluding that charitable organizations may not legally use a raffle to raise 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Many charitable and nonprofit organizations have lost an important means of 
funding because of an attorney general's opinion, which held that raffles are 
illegal under our Constitution," O'Connell said in a press release. "With this 
interpretation, charities have lost a major fund-raising tool, which can be a 
crushing blow to them during these tight budget times." 
</P>
<P>
The state Constitution, which can only be amended by voters, prohibits raffles 
and lotteries that distribute prizes to participants who make donations or pay 
to participate. The exceptions, including the California Lottery and bingo 
games for charitable organizations, were made possible by voter approval of 
amendments to the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bowling, a spokesman for O'Connell, said cancellation of the raffle at 
Santa Clara High School prompted parents and school representatives to urge the 
assemblyman to propose the change in state law. 
</P>
<P>
However, O'Connell may have his work cut out for him. Two previous attempts to 
adopt similar legislation have failed, one in 1988 by Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) and another in 1989 by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier 
(D-South San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Joe Yocca, an administrative assistant to McClintock, said both pieces of 
legislation passed the Assembly but were killed in a state Senate committee at 
the behest of law enforcement officials who feared that the legislation would 
allow organized crime to profit from such raffles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to give it one more shot to convince the members of that 
committee that this is the right thing to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said Thursday that he helped draft the legislation sponsored by 
McClintock and would support any effort to allow charitable organizations to 
continue to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he has not seen O'Connell's legislation but added that he will 
support the measure if it contains restrictions allowing only charitable 
organizations to profit from such raffles. 
</P>
<P>
"With some real tough guidelines, my office will support it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling said the legislation introduced by O'Connell would require 
organizations that operate raffles and lotteries to qualify for nonprofit 
status under state and federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how organized crime will get involved with a nonprofit group," he 
said.

ELY ORDERED TO PAY $17,156 TO SIMI BANK; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE COMMISSIONER SAYS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE DID NOT DENY THAT 
HE OWED THE MONEY.

A Municipal Court commissioner ordered Ventura County Community College Trustee 
Tom Ely to pay $17,156.59 plus attorney's fees to Simi Valley Bank for 
outstanding debts -- declining to delay the action Thursday despite Ely's 
failure to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner John V. Paventi rejected Ely's reason for not being able to attend 
the civil trial in Ventura Municipal Court, which was the result of a lawsuit 
filed by the bank against Ely and his wife, Ingrid, last January. 
</P>
<P>
Paventi said the Elys had sent letters to the bank's attorneys asking that the 
trial be continued because they would be out of town on district business this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
However, Paventi said, the couple failed to submit a formal request to the 
court for such action, so he decided to proceed with the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendants failed to appear for no good reason," Paventi said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who declined to comment on the case, are in Burlingame at a 
conference of the California Assn. of Community Colleges that runs through 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The bank filed the lawsuit against the Elys on Jan. 31, alleging that, since 
September, the couple had not made a payment on credit card bills and a 
personal loan, debts totaling $16,500. The balance of Thursday's judgment is 
from interest accrued during the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"We will collect in full," Susan Jay, the attorney representing the bank, said 
after the court's ruling. Jay said she did not know how much time Ely would 
have to pay back the money because attorney's fees and court costs have yet to 
be settled. 
</P>
<P>
The bank had originally sought $28,658 in the lawsuit but agreed to settle for 
the lesser amount before the civil trial. Jay declined to comment on why the 
bank waived its claim to the additional money. 
</P>
<P>
Paventi said his ruling was based on the fact that the Elys, in a formal 
response to the lawsuit, did not deny any of the allegations of debt in the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In the legal document filed earlier this month, the Elys stated that they "had 
attempted to perform all duties and obligations . . . in an honest and just 
fashion" and that the entire episode arose from the "conduct of the plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who is a candidate for a county supervisor's seat, has been the subject of 
controversy since it was revealed last month that he had run up gambling debts 
at Nevada casinos. The Golden Nugget filed a lawsuit against Ely in February 
over $8,000 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has said he owes less than $20,000 to various Nevada casinos and is in the 
process of paying all of them, except the Golden Nugget. He said he and the 
casino are involved in a dispute over the amount owed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the gambling allegations, the district attorney's office 
recently began a criminal investigation of Ely for possible misappropriation of 
district funds after investigators received a copy of an audit of his district 
expense records. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees commissioned the audit after learning of Ely's gambling 
activities and after a disclosure that he used a district telephone to call 
casinos and hotels in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has denied that he charged more than $8,400 in questionable expenses as the 
audit showed. The audit also listed $6,978 in claims submitted without proper 
documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has said that the audit was flawed because it did not abide by district 
travel policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees is expected to take up the matter at a special meeting on 
Tuesday.

FEES RAISED FOR BOATERS AT 2 VENTURA MARINAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH HARLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite testimony from a roomful of concerned boaters, Ventura Harbor 
commissioners have voted to raise fees for boat slip rentals and for sailors 
who live aboard their vessels in the harbor's two major recreational marinas. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in June, more than 1,125 boaters who rent slips at Ventura Isle 
Marina and Ventura West Marina will pay about 5% more for their slips. And 
about 130 "live-aboards" at Ventura West will pay the 5% increase, plus 10% 
more to reside on their boats. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for live-aboards at Ventura Isle Marina was not raised Wednesday 
because commissioners approved a fee hike of $25 per person in January. The 
slip fee increase approved Wednesday means that a couple living at Ventura Isle 
Marina on a 40-foot vessel will now pay $532, a $16 increase. 
</P>
<P>
At Ventura West, the increase for live-aboards, including the hike in slip 
fees, means that a couple living on a 40-foot boat will now pay $487 per month, 
an increase of $31. Boaters at the marina pay extra for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Boaters jammed the hearing room to voice concern about the increases, calling 
on marina owners to improve security and maintenance. Many of them, however, 
praised Ventura West Manager Tom Kotal for running a ship-shape marina. 
</P>
<P>
Though boaters took a more conciliatory tack at the meeting, in a five-page 
letter signed last week by three dozen Ventura West boaters, the marina was 
vilified as a "cash cow." The boaters said that "a decision has been made to 
milk the facility for as much as possible and to put no more back into the 
facility than absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The boaters asked for better security in parking lots and improved maintenance 
in bathroom, laundry and other facilities. Boaters at Ventura Isle Marina also 
questioned the slip fee increases, saying maintenance needs to be improved. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to the letter, Ventura Harbor General Manager Richard Parsons said 
port district officials have "walked the harbor," and marina owners and 
managers "do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Kotal defended his operation's maintenance but said he plans to hire a private 
security guard to patrol parking lots at night. 
</P>
<P>
Marina owners lease their property from the harbor, paying 20% of their gross 
profits as rent. Harbor officials retain the authority to approve any fee 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Though only one rate increase has been rejected in recent years, Parsons said, 
the commissioners are not rubber-stamping rate hikes. "These fees are not out 
of order," he said, quoting a consumer price index increase of 6.5% last year 
in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
But some small boaters still say they are being priced out of the market. 
Ventura Isle boat owner David Webb, in a protest filed with the commissioners, 
said marina owners "seem intent on making the ownership of a boat totally 
impossible for all but the very rich."

LATINO PARENTS PROTEST LACK OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 25 Latino parents staged a demonstration Thursday to protest the lack of 
Spanish-language instruction for children attending the Sun Valley elementary 
school where teachers started a statewide anti-bilingual education movement. 
</P>
<P>
Parents protesting at the Glenwood School said teachers there are ignoring 
state and district rules that require their children to be taught subjects in 
their native language. 
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to have a bilingual program," said Margarita Cardenas, who has 
three children at the school. "But the teachers and administrators here are not 
providing the proper instruction." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the school's 818 students speak limited English, school 
officials said. Nearly 90% of the students enrolled at Glenwood are Latino. But 
only four of 28 teachers there have been certified as proficient in Spanish, 
Principal Art Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem at Glenwood, Chandler said, is the same as at other schools in the 
district: a shortage of qualified bilingual teachers. The school is conforming 
with state and district bilingual requirements by using Spanish-speaking 
classroom aides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters said, however, that teachers belonging to a group called Learning 
English Advocates Drive have made only halfhearted efforts to implement the 
district's bilingual program. 
</P>
<P>
The founder of LEAD, as well as its top officers, teach at Glenwood. The group 
believes that children should not be taught subjects in any language other than 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Glenwood teacher June Frankenberg, a LEAD officer, agreed that most teachers at 
the school oppose the district's bilingual education plan. She said she was not 
opposed to students being bilingual but would prefer that they learn and speak 
Spanish at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are not going to learn English if they are being taught in Spanish," 
said Frankenberg, who teaches a class of fourth- and fifth-graders. "All my 
students are learning English, and they are happy." 
</P>
<P>
The LEAD group, founded in 1987, claims a membership of 20,000. Founder Sally 
Peterson, a Glenwood kindergarten teacher who has received help from the 
English-only movement, has given LEAD national attention as an outspoken 
opponent of bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Flora Cole, vice chairman of the district's bilingual and bicultural advisory 
committee serving the area, said that kind of thinking is creating problems for 
children who have done well at schools in their own country, then enroll in the 
Los Angeles district speaking little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are not taught subjects in their native language right away, the 
alternative is to spend two to three years learning English," Cole said. 
"During that time they're falling behind, losing interest and, finally, 
dropping out." 
</P>
<P>
The district's bilingual education program is intended to teach students 
subjects in their native language while they learn English gradually over one 
to three years. In that fashion students continue to advance in subjects such 
as reading, writing and arithmetic while they are learning English. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Education officials are investigating whether Glenwood and 
other schools in the Los Angeles school district receiving state bilingual 
funds are complying with requirements for use of the money, spokeswoman Susie 
Lange said.

JUDGE WILL NOT FORCE 'LOWER COST' DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HIDDEN HILLS: THE BUILDER COULD STILL SUE THE CITY OVER THE PROJECT, WHICH 
WOULD HAVE INCLUDED LOW-INCOME HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Saying he was reluctant to involve himself in the details of running the city 
government of Hidden Hills, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge Thursday 
declined to order the wealthy city to build a controversial development that 
would include lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge R. William Schoettler, Jr. said his ruling should not deter the 
proposed project's developer from pursuing a lawsuit that the judge said could 
"potentially" cost the city $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettler's decision appeared to open the way for the unraveling of a 1989 
court-approved settlement in which Hidden Hills agreed to "advance and develop, 
and if appropriate construct" lower-cost housing for senior citizens. It also 
cast doubt over the future of the city's redevelopment agency and a 
$5.9-million flood-control project that Los Angeles County was to fund as part 
of the same settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the newly elected Hidden Hills City Council has "a sincere desire" 
to "undo everything" regarding the settlement, Schoettler said: "I have no 
particular desire to force down the city of Hidden Hills' throat a 
redevelopment program of any sort. . . . I am reluctant to intervene in the 
government process of Hidden Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Schoettler's decision Thursday contrasted sharply with remarks he made last 
month, when he said in court that he was prepared to order city officials into 
his court to see that the redevelopment suit settlement was carried out as 
agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached in a lawsuit filed in 1984 by the county and a 
private attorney over the formation of the Hidden Hills redevelopment agency to 
fund the storm drain. Part of the lawsuit by the county dealt with state 
requirements that 20% of redevelopment funds be spent on "affordable" housing. 
</P>
<P>
To settle the suit, Hidden Hills agreed to annex and zone land where Tarzana 
builder Danny Howard was proposing to construct nine single-family homes, an 
office building and -- at the city's suggestion -- a lower-cost housing 
project. The county in turn agreed to pay for most of the storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
But public disclosure of the deal caused an uproar in Hidden Hills, a gated 
community of private streets where the average home price recently was 
estimated at more than $800,000. This month, voters overwhelmingly installed a 
new council majority that had campaigned against Howard's project and said 
redevelopment was not needed. The new council took office this week and 
immediately set out to contest the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Howard filed his own lawsuit last year, alleging that the council was trying to 
back out of the deal. On Thursday he asked Schoettler to order the city to 
approve his project by May 6, when he said his option to purchase the land will 
expire. 
</P>
<P>
Although the judge turned down Howard's request, he spoke several times of 
"potential" damages the city could face if Howard takes his suit before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael Jenkins, an attorney for the city, argued that the settlement is 
invalid, the judge said: "You will lose on the issue of whether or not those 
acts were valid. . . . I think it's a lousy position." 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about at least a seven-figure judgment potential," Schoettler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, Howard's attorney, said he would seek "eight figures." 
Howard, he said, was "dragged" in by the city's promises of a development 
agreement and its annexation of the site, only to have his project dashed by 
the political firestorm later. 
</P>
<P>
The city operates on a budget of about $300,000 and has a cash reserve of about 
$900,000, said Chris K. Van Peski, a former councilman defeated this month. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing at the hearing was former Hidden Hills City Atty. Wayne K. 
Lemieux, who had been fired by the new council at a special meeting only hours 
before. Lemieux said he was still the attorney for the city redevelopment 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
New council members David G. Stanley and Howard Klein said the agency's future 
will be the subject of public hearings. But Klein and Councilwoman Susan Norris 
Porcaro had made criticism of the agency a focus of their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A theme of the new council's campaigns was that residents opposed taking 
redevelopment funds from county tax rolls for affluent Hidden Hills, and that 
they did not necessarily oppose lower-cost housing. Jenkins made the same 
argument Thursday to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux countered that the 6-year-old agency was not opposed until lower-cost 
housing entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said: "I suspect that's probably a little closer to the true facts."

FIEDLER BACKS BOLAND FOR LA FOLLETTE'S ASSEMBLY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, in a move that may help pave the way for a political 
comeback, said Thursday she is endorsing real estate broker Paula Boland to 
succeed retiring Republican Assemblywoman Marian La Follette of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler joins a list of prominent conservative Republican political figures in 
the San Fernando Valley who are backing Boland against her chief opponent, 
longtime La Follette aide Robert Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
Boland also has been endorsed by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), 
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, Wilcox and three less well-known Republicans are competing for the GOP 
nomination in the 38th Assembly District, which arcs across the northern San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers have speculated about a possible comeback by Fiedler, who 
gave up a Valley-based congressional seat to make her failed 1986 run for the 
U.S. Senate. In an interview, Fiedler, 52, said she is interested in running 
for Bernson's council post or Antonovich's supervisor seat, if either left 
office voluntarily. If Boland wins the Assembly seat, she could provide Fiedler 
with valuable assistance in a future campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler pledged to "do everything I can" to help Boland raise money. Fiedler 
said that, last month, she accompanied Boland to the state GOP convention in 
Santa Clara, where Fiedler introduced Boland to various elected officials and 
party activists. 
</P>
<P>
"Paula is a longtime personal friend who I've had the privilege of working with 
on a broad base of issues," Fiedler said. "She's been a strong supporter, and 
she has an incredibly fine background." 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler cited Boland's grass-roots involvement in local Republican political 
campaigns, her efforts to promote tax-cutting Proposition 13, and her 
involvement in anti-busing efforts and with local chambers of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
She also mentioned Boland's efforts to promote construction of the Simi Valley 
Freeway and her membership on the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation 
Commission, which oversees efforts to expand existing cities or create new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows how to get things done," Fiedler said. "She's going to knock the 
socks off the Legislature when she gets up there." Fiedler added that Boland 
brokered the sale of Fiedler's husband's house and the purchase of her 
daughter's. 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler vacated her congressional seat to run for the GOP Senate nomination in 
1986. But her candidacy unraveled after she was indicted following charges by 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), who also was seeking the nomination, 
that she had offered him $100,000 to get out of the race. A judge subsequently 
threw out the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Fiedler has remained active in state and local GOP politics. In 
1988, she served as Southern California co-chairwoman of George Bush's 
presidential campaign. This year, she is co-chairwoman of Angela (Bay) 
Buchanan's campaign for the GOP nomination for state treasurer.

CORPS VOWS TO USE TREES OFFERED AS 'URBAN FOREST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday it would find a way to use 1,000 
trees being offered by a San Fernando Valley business association that has 
launched a campaign -- without the Army's approval -- to grow an "urban forest" 
in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Industry and Commercial Assn. announced earlier this week that it 
wanted to raise $150,000 to buy the trees for a 60-acre site along the basin's 
northern edge, at Victory and Balboa boulevards, where a proposed cultural 
center might be built. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement caused confusion among officials from the Corps of Engineers, 
which owns the flood-control basin, and the city of Los Angeles, which leases 
the land for park use. 
</P>
<P>
The association never asked permission to undertake a mass planting on the 
site, federal and city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They also said there might not be enough irrigation and land to sustain that 
many trees. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, however, the group planted a symbolic sycamore tree at the site and 
the corps said it would make every effort to put future donations to use. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to turn down 1,000 trees," said Ruth Villalobos, chief of the 
corps' Environmental Resources Branch. "We'd be willing to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
VICA has sent a fund-raising brochure to its 242 member corporations asking for 
donations to buy camphor, jacaranda, California live oak and other varieties of 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
The association said it wanted to purchase the trees by next fall or spring. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion between the association and government officials began when VICA said 
the corps had approved the fund drive. 
</P>
<P>
The corps denied giving any approval. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the association said it had a list of about 1,000 trees designated 
by the corps specifically for the basin. 
</P>
<P>
The corps, however, said the list had been drawn up for another community 
organization interested in donating trees, park benches, water fountains and 
other amenities to the park. 
</P>
<P>
A VICA spokeswoman later confirmed that her group had not received the list 
directly from the corps. 
</P>
<P>
At this time, the 60-acre site where the trees would be planted is not 
irrigated. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposed arts center is built, a private group called the Cultural 
Foundation, which is trying to fund the complex, would install a watering 
system, Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
The Arts Park L.A. project -- which could include theaters, workshops and 
exhibit spaces -- will be debated at an upcoming public hearing and must be 
approved by the corps and the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is not built, the corps said it would irrigate the 60 acres 
itself, ask the city to do so or find other places in the basin for the trees. 
</P>
<P>
That task could take a number of years, a corps official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to raising $150,000 to plant 1,000 trees in the basin," said 
Laurie Golden, a VICA spokeswoman. "And we are excited and gratified that the 
Army Corps of Engineers is going to help us make this happen."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Encino attorney has been arrested on suspicion of being under the influence 
of drugs and possessing them after he was searched at a Van Nuys Courthouse 
security checkpoint, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn H. Clark, had a small quantity of amphetamines and marijuana in his 
briefcase and appeared to be under the influence of amphetamines, said Lt. 
Clifford Green of the Los Angeles County Safety Police. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs were discovered during a hand search Tuesday afternoon, Green said. 
Clark, 36, a partner in the Encino law firm of Omansky, Bradford and Clark, was 
placed in the Van Nuys Jail but freed on $1,000 bail early Tuesday evening, a 
jail official said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Presiding Judge Richard G. Kolostian said attorneys 
carrying State Bar of California cards normally do not have to go through the 
Courthouse metal detector or undergo searches.

Clark could not be reached for comment.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LARSON WILL HEAD CSUN CENTER FOR DEAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Herbert Larson has been named permanent director of the National Center on 
Deafness at Cal State Northridge, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Larson was appointed acting director in mid-March after the center's former 
director, Victor H. Galloway, was asked to resign amid complaints of mismanaged 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The center provides interpreting and note-taking services for deaf students who 
attend regular CSUN classes. Larson formerly was administrator of support 
services at the center. 
</P>
<P>
An audit of the center's budget conducted at the end of March found that 
Galloway had spent nearly all of the budget for the 1989-90 school year by the 
third month of the second semester. Campus administrators cut travel, hiring 
and student worker funding for the remainder of the year and agreed to provide 
additional money to continue interpreting services through June. 
</P>
<P>
A review of the center's programs -- including an analysis of whether it would 
be more efficient to fold it into the School of Education -- is expected to be 
completed in the fall.

FACULTY SENATE ATTACKS CLEARY FOR KEEPING ROTC AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Cal State Northridge Faculty Senate criticized university 
President James W. Cleary Thursday for his decision to continue ROTC at the San 
Fernando Valley campus despite a faculty recommendation to abolish the military 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, a resolution to take their concerns directly to the CSU Academic 
Senate, which will consider the ROTC issue next month, failed for lack of a 
quorum among the 86-member faculty organization. Thursday's meeting was the 
first public confrontation between the faculty and the president since Cleary 
announced his decision on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign language professor Edda Spielman said Cleary's decision "simply did not 
make any sense" and was "tantamount . . . to putting an official stamp of 
approval on certain kinds of discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Faculty had urged Cleary to ban the programs because the U.S. Department of 
Defense excludes people who are openly homosexual from military service. 
</P>
<P>
Currently 42 CSUN students participate in ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary said in a statement Monday that although he abhorred the discriminatory 
policy, he did not believe a state university had a legal right to attempt to 
change policies dictated by federal law. He said he based his decision on an 
opinion from a California State University system lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not in a position to challenge this," Cleary told the Senate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Littwin, a political science professor, chastised Cleary for accepting 
the CSU counsel's opinion without question. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an age when people can emerge from the bureaucracy," Littwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Littwin and other faculty members bolstered their arguments by reading from the 
university's 1976 contract with the Air Force ROTC, which gives either party 
the right to terminate the relationship with six months notice, regardless of 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
Students who spoke during the Faculty Senate meeting asked that Cleary 
reconsider his position. 
</P>
<P>
"President Cleary could've taken a gigantic step toward social change" by 
adopting the recommendation from the faculty and a similar one drafted by 
students, said junior Brent Larson. "Instead he chose to ignore them." 
</P>
<P>
Many faculty members spoke in support of the resolution to the statewide 
Academic Senate, which will consider a proposal in early May to strip ROTC of 
much of its campus status systemwide. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Senate lost its quorum before the issue could be voted on because 
many faculty members left the meeting. During recent months quorums frequently 
have been lost during discussion of controversial issues, which often are 
delayed until late in the afternoon.

The Cultural Foundation, a Woodland Hills nonprofit group that is trying to

"You Me and a Tree" includes drawings of trees, animals and birds that are

18-YEAR-OLD SENTENCED IN SCHOOL FIRE

<P>
An 18-year-old Oxnard student has been sentenced to seven years and eight 
months in the California Youth Authority for setting a fire that destroyed most 
of Hueneme High School's administration wing in October. 
</P>
<P>
However, the youth cannot be held past his 21st birthday because he was a minor 
when he set fire to his school, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bond. The Oct. 14 fire, which was set in Assistant Principal Daisy Tatum's 
office, caused an estimated $400,000 to $800,000 of damage, Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond said the Ventura County district attorney's office will seek some form of 
probation for the youth after he turns 21. He declined to name the youth 
because of his age at the time of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators never determined the motive for the fire, and said there is no 
evidence that it was aimed at Tatum. "It was an angry attack on a fundamental 
institution of this society, on the schools," Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old who acted as lookout during the arson and a 16-year-old who 
kicked in a school window to let the arsonist inside were found guilty of 
burglary, but were never charged with arson, Bond said. They have since been 
expelled from Hueneme High School. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hueneme High School officials and counselors are working in four 
trailers, which were set up on school grounds as temporary offices after the 
fire, Tatum said. MACK REED

5 LIBRARIES TO OPEN SUNDAY AFTERNOONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five county libraries will be open Sunday afternoons beginning this Sunday 
under a plan approved by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Library, the E.P. Foster Library in Ventura, Ojai Library, the Ray D. 
Prueter Library in Port Hueneme and Simi Valley Library will be open Sundays 
from 1 to 4 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, four of the libraries were forced to close Sundays because of 
staffing and financial problems, said Susan Peterson, community libraries 
manager for the Ventura County Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The reinstatement of the Sunday hours is the last step of a staffing and 
financing plan approved by the supervisors in the fall. Officials had cut back 
the hours because there were not enough librarians to cope with the heavy 
workload at some of the county's 15 libraries. 
</P>
<P>
For example, although the number of requests for information increased from 
about 166,000 in 1984 to about 225,000 requests in 1989, staffing levels were 
not increased to cope with the increasingly heavy workload, said Dixie 
Adeniran, director of the county Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors appropriated $318,600 from a contingency fund so the library 
could hire more help, said Jim Becker, senior administrative analyst for the 
Library Services Agency. JEFF SCHNAUFER

FARMERS OPPOSE PESTICIDE MEASURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A number of Ventura County farmers have joined a campaign against an initiative 
sponsored by environmentalists that would ban the use of certain pesticides in 
California over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, called Big Green by proponents, is being sponsored by 
environmentalists and Democratic leaders Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the measure would ban 32 of 300 pesticides determined by the 
Environmental Protection Agency to cause birth defects and cancer, spokeswoman 
Liberty Godshall said. 
</P>
<P>
It would also restrict the importation of produce that had been sprayed with 
those chemicals and provide $40 million for research into alternatives to 
pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative initiative has been drafted by an organization of grocers, 
farmers and agricultural businessmen called Californians for Responsible Food 
Laws. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Stitzenberger, a Los Angeles political consultant who heads the farmers' 
campaign, said sponsors of the farmers' initiative are prepared to spend 
between $750,000 and $1 million on a statewide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzenberger said 372,000 signatures are needed by the May 27 deadline to put 
the initiative on the ballot. So far, the growers' group says, it has gathered 
about 300,000 signatures, about 1,500 in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to find that the ag interests in the state are going to mobilize," 
said Clark Johnson, a Fillmore citrus grower. He said petitioners have targeted 
supermarkets, nurseries and farming supply stores. PSYCHE PASCUAL

MAN FACING FRAUD CHARGES SUES OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard man facing criminal fraud charges for allegedly marketing a heat pump 
hailed as a source of "free electricity" filed a civil rights suit against the 
Ventura County district attorney and sheriff's offices in Los Angeles federal 
court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis M. Lee, 43, is facing 38 charges of violating California consumer 
protection laws and eight charges of theft by misrepresentation for marketing 
an allegedly energy-saving solar heat pump called the Alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is free on $20,000 bond, pending a trial in Ventura County Superior Court. 
But prosecutors have filed a motion to revoke his bail because "he is once 
again selling and using misrepresentation to do so," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Rebecca Dean Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that sheriff's 
deputies searched his Ventura office on Jan. 14, 1988, without a warrant and 
denied his right to free speech by arresting him on June 22, 1988, just before 
he was to host a marketing meeting at a hotel near Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also charges that he was jailed for nine months on an 
unconstitutionally "excessive" bail of $1 million after his arrest, an amount 
that later was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that the district attorney's move to revoke his bail 
April 9, after he told a meeting of investors in February about his arrest, 
violates his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said the Sheriff's Department had a warrant for the search, which led to 
Lee's arrest for allegedly defrauding potential investors in his heat pump 
company, CONSERVE Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's print advertisements for the Alternative promised "free electricity 
extracted from the air," Riley said. Lee sold videotapes, blueprints and 
documents describing the Alternative, and he offered investors a chance to buy 
into manufacture and marketing of the device, she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the videotapes misrepresented the performance ratings of the 
Alternative and falsely claimed that it was listed with Underwriters Laboratory 
and that the marketing plan included a bonding program, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and the Sheriff's Department declined further comment.

A man was fatally shot this morning when he attempted to rob a camper in 
Angeles National Forest north of Castaic, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of those involved in the 2:20 a.m. shooting at a campground called 
Frenchman's Flat were not released this morning as investigators attempted to 
sort out what happened, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The campground is west of the Golden State Freeway between Castaic and Pyramid 
Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said three men apparently accosted a camper and were trying to rob him 
when the camper opened fire. One of the alleged robbers was struck and the 
other two fled. 
</P>
<P>
The injured man was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where he 
died. Estrada said the other two men were taken into custody near the 
campground and were being questioned this morning. The camper who fired the gun 
was not arrested.

<P>
Moscow has begun diverting food from Lithuania after a cutoff of fuel in what 
amounts to a calculated "blockade," a senior minister said today just hours 
after club-wielding paratroopers stormed a Vilnius printing plant. 
</P>
<P>
A food blockade would be the toughest action carried out by the Kremlin since 
Lithuania declared its independence five weeks ago, a move that led President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to slash fuel supplies Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received telegraphed documents that confirm that not only oil and gas 
but also food products have been diverted from Lithuania," Deputy Prime 
Minister Romualdas Ozolas told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Ozolas said two ships from Cuba carrying raw sugar for Lithuania had been 
diverted from the Baltic republic's port of Kleipeda. He said supplies of fish 
from Latvia, destined for Lithuania, had been sent somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot speak about some misunderstanding," Ozolas said. "I am sure this is 
a part of a complex of measures that can be called a blockade." 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said supplies of rubber tires, 
cables, ball bearings, plastics, and other materials have also been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"Plants in various industries will have to stop working if we do not get the 
supplies through other channels," Landsbergis said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Soviet paratroopers stormed a Lithuanian printing plant earlier today 
and clubbed about 30 people, including the head of the environmentalist Greens 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three people were hospitalized after the attack, said Algimantas 
Cekuolis, a top Lithuanian Communist Party member. 
</P>
<P>
The troops rushed into the plant operated by the rebel Lithuanian Communist 
Party and began flailing away but were confronted by Lithuanian officials who 
had been alerted to the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Cekuolis said the soldiers at one point tried to throw the employees off the 
premises but were prevented by about 3,000 onlookers chanting, "Fascists, 
fascists." 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, led by a colonel, remained in the building in Vilnius' 
picturesque old town in an uneasy standoff. 
</P>
<P>
Workers appeared periodically on the balcony to loud cheers from the crowd.

KIDNAPERS' DEMAND A 'SMOKE SCREEN,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS

The White House said today that new terrorist demands over the promised release 
of an American hostage are a "smoke screen" and part of a troubling pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"They do it every time," presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said 
when asked if kidnapers holding three Americans are toying with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Syria still believes there's a possibility of release. We'll just have to wait 
and see if they're sincere and hope that they are," Fitzwater said 
</P>
<P>
President Bush on Thursday defended his decision not to send a U.S. envoy to 
Syria, as the kidnapers demanded before they would release a hostage. "The 
United States does not knuckle under to demands," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater spoke aboard Air Force One as Bush flew here today from Key Largo, 
Fla., to help raise money for an underdog Republican candidate for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was in Birmingham for a fund-raiser for state Sen. Bill Cabaniss, a 
conservative businessman trying to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Howell 
Heflin. He was then flying to Orlando, Fla., for another political fund-raiser 
before returning to Key Largo for a weekend of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Cabaniss fund-raiser, Bush renewed his plea for passage of 
a capital gains tax cut, from the current 33% top to 19% or lower. The tax in 
Japan on stocks and bonds is only 1%, Bush said, and other Asian trading rivals 
"don't tax them at all." 
</P>
<P>
"Once again I call on the Congress to pass that bill. It's time we stop giving 
the edge to (other) countries," said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
He also called for "rejecting the ideas of extremists on both sides" of the 
environmental debate, and passing a clean air bill that doesn't throw people 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, asked about the complaint from the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of 
Palestine that Bush had not dispatched the envoy they requested to Syria, 
Fitzwater said, "That was just a smoke screen." He said the United States has 
an ambassador in Damascus capable of conducting any talks that are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
He called the terrorist demand, which came after they had promised to release 
an American by today, part of "troublesome patterns that we've seen before." He 
cited the terrorists' release of a photograph of one hostage one day, and of 
another hostage a day later. 
</P>
<P>
"The pattern is very much the same," Fitzwater said. "They announce the 
release, put out pictures for videotape or letters and then there's some demand 
or reason why it can't happen. So our attitude is to be prepared to take all 
the precautions and the preparations necessary to facilitate it if it does 
happen, but not to get overly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in Lithuania, Fitzwater said U.S. officials are still talking 
with allies around the world about appropriate responses to intensified Soviet 
pressures on the breakaway republic. "There's still a lot of unknowns we're 
trying to work out," Fitzwater said.

COURT LETS JEWISH SETTLERS STAY IN CHRISTIAN QUARTER

<P>
Israel's Supreme Court today allowed 150 Jewish settlers to remain in a 
compound in the city's Christian Quarter until the high court hears more 
arguments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruled in response to an order by Atty. Gen. Yosef Harish on 
Thursday that the settlers immediately leave the 72-room, four-building complex 
inside Jerusalem's walled Old City. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers created a furor and ignited demonstrations by both Christians and 
Muslims when they moved into the building owned by the Greek Orthodox Church on 
April 11. The church claims that a former tenant illegally sold his user rights 
to the building to the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
Harish, backed by two lower court decisions, on Thursday ordered the settlers 
to leave because their presence had harmed Christian-Jewish relations in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
But the three-judge Supreme Court panel issued a restraining order against the 
eviction today and asked Harish to show at a hearing next Thursday why his 
order should not be annulled. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlers will be allowed to stay until there is a final decision by the 
high court," said attorney Dan Avi-Yitzhak, who represents a Panama-based 
company that bought the rights to use the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Yohanan Altbauer, an attorney representing the church, said the judges offered 
a compromise under which the settlers would have left the building, but a few 
company representatives would have remained until lower courts decided on 
tenancy rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides rejected the compromise," Altbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions rose because the settlement upset the traditional division of the 
religious communities in the Old City. There are about 50,000 Muslims, 7,000 
Christians and 4,000 Jews in the old, walled city. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also has political implications, since the Old City is part of 
the area captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel 
annexed the area into its capital, but most countries, including the United 
States, do not recognize Israel's claim to sovereignty. Palestinians have 
demanded that Jerusalem become the capital of their would-be independent state.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, seeking reelection as union chairman, apologized 
today for his strong-handed rule but reminded his critics that the results of 
his administration brought victory for Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, his voice shaking with emotion as he addressed the union's second 
congress, recalled when he jumped the shipyard wall in 1980 to lead the strike 
triggering the rise of Solidarity, the East Bloc's first free trade union. 
</P>
<P>
"You liked my jump over the wall and you elected me to drive the vehicle called 
Solidarity," said Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
He said the union had to operate under martial law imposed on Dec. 13, 1981, by 
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, now Poland's president, with thousands of activists 
jailed. He said quick Solidarity decisions by one man were needed. 
</P>
<P>
"If I obeyed some of you then I would have crushed the vehicle," Walesa said. 
"I had no time for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
He said union officials criticized him for not holding meetings deemed illegal 
by communist authorities, but when he yielded and organized a meeting of 
Solidarity leaders, "the result was their trial and multi-year sentences." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa won an overwhelming vote of confidence from Solidarity after his 
impassioned defense of his 10 years as the movement's leader. 
</P>
<P>
Just 24 hours before an expected reelection bid, Walesa asked for a show of 
support. Delegates present responded with a vote of 357 in favor, one against 
and 22 abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I apologize for offending some of you," he said. "I forgive you and ask your 
forgiveness," Walesa said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a resolution passed by Solidarity's congress to invite former 
Solidarity members to the congress, many of them opponents of Walesa, the union 
leader threatened to walk out if one particular man came. Walesa did not 
identify him, but was apparently referring to a longtime rival, Andrzej 
Gwiazda. 
</P>
<P>
Leaflets tossed in the air in the hall Thursday by Gwiazda's followers said 
Walesa formed a Solidarity dictatorship similar to the former communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Solidarity source said some delegates were considering a move to 
limit Walesa's power as leader of the union.

The reputed mentor of kidnapers holding three American educators said today 
that the release of a hostage is certain despite complications caused by the 
United States' "arrogant . . . cowboy" behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"The delay is certain, the complications are certain, but the release is also 
certain," said Hussein Musawi. 
</P>
<P>
Musawi, a Shiite Muslim, heads Islamic Amal, a faction within the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah that advocates strong links with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he expects the release to take place, Musawi said, "That depends on 
how farsighted the Americans might become. So far, their behavior is arrogant 
and one of cowboy mentality."

Hundreds of thousands of Iranians converged on Tehran University today 
shouting, "Death to Israel, death to America!" President Ayatollah Hashemi 
Rafsanjani told them that fighting Israel is a Muslim's highest duty. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, combined with Friday prayers, marked "Qods (Jerusalem) Day," the 
last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which Iran's late supreme 
leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, dedicated to the support of the 
Palestinian cause. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd included women clad in black chadors, or Islamic head-to-toe 
coverings, and children. The annual turnout is widely seen as a barometer of 
the public support Iran's clerical leaders can muster. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani criticized Arab countries like Egypt which he said understand the 
danger from Israel but did nothing about it.

President Frederik W. de Klerk put his job on the line today, telling 
Parliament that domination of South Africa's black majority could not end while 
a white president holds office. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as so much power is concentrated in the hands of one person, if he is 
white, then no matter what the rest of the system is, there is white 
domination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He told legislators that his job will be up for discussion in proposed 
negotiations about a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
With the present power of the job, a black presidency would inevitably mean 
black domination and a Conservative Party presidency would mean conservative 
white domination, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Along with constitutional reform, the state president's post must be 
fundamentally reformed," he said.

A handyman accused of setting a shotgun booby trap that killed an intruder in 
his warehouse turned himself in to face a possible murder charge and was 
ordered held without bond today. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Connaghan, 46, was booked at the Denver County Jail for investigation of 
first-degree murder Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Denver County Judge Larry Bohning denied him bail this morning, leaving the 
district attorney's office three days to decide whether to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McComb, 19, of Denver was shot in the chest Saturday night by a 
12-gauge shotgun inside the warehouse Connaghan leased. Three youths who were 
with McComb said they entered the warehouse for an adventure not as thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shotgun was attached to a trip wire they believe Connaghan 
rigged. The front door of the warehouse bore the inscription: "Danger -- Enter 
at own risk." 
</P>
<P>
Connaghan told police he had no knowledge of the booby trap. 
</P>
<P>
The warehouse had been burglarized eight times since 1987.

Japan's steel exports in fiscal 1989 hit a 19-year low largely because of 
sluggish sales to its major customers, China and the Soviet Union, the Iron and 
Steel Federation said in a preliminary report today. 
</P>
<P>
The federation said exports in the fiscal year, which ended March 31, were 
estimated at 18.99 million metric tons, down 18.3% from the preceding year and 
the lowest since fiscal 1970, when Japan's overseas sales totaled 19.75 million 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
Federation officials said there is little possibility that Japan's sluggish 
steel exports will pick up although domestic demand will remain strong.

The Upjohn Co. has agreed to pay $1.8 million to settle a 5-year-old suit 
alleging pollution of the Quinnipiac River by the company's North Haven plant. 
</P>
<P>
Two environmental groups announced in New Haven Thursday that Upjohn has agreed 
to set up a trust fund to help restore the Quinnipiac River, which the 
company's North Haven plant has been accused of polluting over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The federal lawsuit accused Upjohn of more than 1,100 violations of the Clean 
Water Act in dumping toxic substances, including carcinogens, into the river. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund, to be administered by the New Haven Foundation, will use up to 
$1.2 million to improve the ecology of the river, New Haven Harbor and their 
watersheds. The rest of the settlement will be used to cover legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine H. Robinson, senior staff attorney for the Connecticut Fund, said the 
agreement is believed to be the largest penalty ever paid for permit violations 
in Connecticut.

The Tribune Co. today reported a 9% drop in its first-quarter earnings and 
blamed operating losses at the New York Daily News and weakness in its 
newsprint business for the slump in profitability. 
</P>
<P>
The company had net income of $33.5 million, or 43 cents per share, in the 
three months ended April 1, down from $36.8 million, or 49 cents per share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 6% to $584 million from $553 million in 1989's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The company's other holdings include the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Cubs 
baseball team, television and radio stations in several major markets as well 
as other newspaper holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Operating profit for Tribune Co.'s newspaper publishing group declined 10% to 
$55.7 million from $61.6 million. The company said the decrease was due to 
larger operating losses at the Daily News resulting from weaker market 
conditions and costs related to contract negotiations with the newspaper's 10 
unions.

Avon Products Inc. said today that a $450-million deal has fallen through in 
which the cosmetics giant was to sell its 60% interest in Avon Japan to Friends

</P>
<P>
John Cox, a spokesman for Avon, said the company declined to extend the closing

two separate royalty prepayments of $70 million and $42 million, until June as 
had been requested by the buyer.

Avon, which previously extended the closing date until April 27 from March 30, 
said it "still plans to sell all or part" of its interest in Avon Japan. Cox 
said the company hoped to complete a deal by year-end. "There are a number of 
potential buyers," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Avon said it will exercise its right to collect a $6.3-million escrow deposit

A $6.5-million rock extravaganza featuring top international stars will be held 
this summer at the Berlin Wall as a "memorial for all war dead," former Pink 
Floyd band leader Roger Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a big show," the British-born rock star said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say some of the world's best-known rock performers, a cast of 300 
extras, choirs and a symphony orchestra will appear in the performance of "The 
Wall," the brainchild of Waters, who first recorded the chart-buster with Pink 
Floyd in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be the biggest rock extravaganza ever," said Jody Miller, one 
of the organizers. She said the names of the performers would only be announced 
once negotiations were completed. 
</P>
<P>
"A 600-foot-long, 60-foot-high wall will be used in the show," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get the Berlin Philharmonic or a Polish or East German orchestra. 
The Red Army Choir has confirmed that they will take part," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the head of one of the puppets in the show "will be as big as a London 
double-decker bus." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Berlin, where he is rehearsing for the July 21 
benefit show, the 46-year-old rock star said the proceeds of the performance 
will go to the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief.

LIZ TAYLOR'S DOCTORS WON'T BE CHARGED

Elizabeth Taylor's doctors prescribed potentially life-threatening doses of 
painkillers to the actress, but their conduct does not warrant criminal 
charges, the district attorney's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the office will refer the allegations against the physicians -- 
William Skinner, Michael Gottlieb and Michael Roth -- to the state medical 
board for possible administrative sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, identified by investigators as Taylor's primary physician, is medical 
director of the chemical dependency center at St. John's Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica. Gottlieb is the immunologist who reported the first 
AIDS case in the United States. Roth is a former partner of Gottlieb's. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the physicians displayed poor judgment in prescribing the 
massive amounts of drugs to Taylor, who they said was exposed to the 
possibility of a fatal overdose. However, the doctors had no criminal intent in 
prescribing the narcotics, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, an Academy Award-winning actress who has frequently admitted her 
dependence on pills and alcohol, was not a subject of the 1 1/2-year 
investigation and did not face any charges. She was interviewed by 
investigators as part of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taylor remained in stable condition at St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center in Santa Monica, suffering from pneumonia, Taylor spokeswoman 
Lisa Del Favaro said. In a statement earlier this week, she denied rumors that 
she is suffering from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The actress' current illness is not believed to be linked to the earlier 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians were investigated for allegedly prescribing massive amounts of 
"Schedule Two" drugs, which include opiates, barbiturates and stimulants, to 
Taylor in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor in the past has talked openly of her dependence on such drugs as Demerol 
and Valium, plus alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Feldstern said in a written report released today 
that Taylor "has suffered from substance abuse for many years, principally 
involving pain medication and alcohol," stemming partly from chronic lower back 
pain she has suffered since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of their entire record, it is clear that the prescribing practices of 
these physicians fell below the accepted standard of medical practice," 
Feldstern said in his report.

Producer-director Bud Yorkin says his latest film, "Love Hurts," may get a name 
change before it is widely released. 
</P>
<P>
The film, shot in the Dallas area, made its debut Thursday night at the USA 
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a mixed response on the title," Yorkin said. "Several people who 
have seen it say the title is too negative, while the picture is too positive." 
</P>
<P>
The film stars Jeff Daniels as a recently divorced salesman heading for his 
small hometown after his divorce to attend his sister's wedding. Amy Wright 
plays his sister. 
</P>
<P>
"It's close to a Woody Allen-type picture," said Yorkin, whose works include 
the film "Divorce American Style" and the TV series "All in the Family.

TAXES: ALREADY BANNED FROM BASEBALL, THE FORMER REDS MANAGER'S ADMISSION OF 
HIDING INCOME FURTHER IMPERILS HIS CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE HALL OF FAME.

A somber and apologetic Pete Rose, banished from baseball for life eight months 
ago for gambling, pleaded guilty today to cheating on his taxes by hiding more 
than a third of a million dollars in income. 
</P>
<P>
Among the earnings Rose failed to report, federal prosecutors revealed in court 
today, was $129,000 he got for selling the bat with which he broke Ty Cobb's 
all-time hitting record in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 49, the game's all-time hits leader, will be sentenced at a later date by 
U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel. He could draw as much as a six-year 
prison sentence, but U.S. Atty. D. Michael Crites refused to speculate on 
whether Rose will wind up behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I am truly sorry for what has happened, and not just because I have had to 
leave baseball, the sport I love," Rose said in a written statement before he 
entered court. 
</P>
<P>
"My family and friends have suffered as well, and I regret the the pain I have 
caused them. I mean that from the bottom of my heart," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I also realize that millions of baseball fans may have been disappointed 
because I didn't live up to the respect and admiration they gave me during my 
career. I am not a bad person, but I did some bad things." 
</P>
<P>
In court today, prosecutors painted a picture of a man so obsessed by gambling 
that he sold his autographs and prized possessions to cover his losses. 
</P>
<P>
They revealed that Rose has already paid the government $366,000 in back taxes, 
interest and penalties, a sum considerably larger than the roughly $162,000 in 
taxes they said he owed on the income he pleaded guilty to failing to report. 
</P>
<P>
Rose acknowledged that his appetite for gambling, which investigators said left 
him in hock to a New York bookmaker for $400,000 at one point, led to his 
trouble with the tax collectors. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty to two counts of filing false federal income tax returns in 
1985 and 1987, involving failure to report more than $354,000 in income from 
personal appearances, the sale of memorabilia and gambling, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
During his brief court appearance, Rose, dressed in a dark blue business suit, 
was somber save a flicker of a smile when the judge asked him if he was under 
under the influence of any drugs and cognizant of what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes sir, I'm clearheaded," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
The plea, worked out with the government, avoided an indictment on what might 
have been more serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
But if left Rose's future in baseball even more cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
At the time he was banished from the game last August by the late Baseball 
Commissioner Bart Giamatti, Rose said he expected his exile to be a short one. 
He will be eligible to apply for reinstatement this August, one year after he 
was kicked out. 
</P>
<P>
The tax troubles may also have further damaged the former Cincinnati Reds 
manager's chances for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame -- something that 
had been considered almost automatic until his tax troubles surfaced last year. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, however, made an appeal to the baseball writers who will vote in a year 
and a half on whether to put him in the baseball shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they'll understand that the mistakes I made off the field were caused 
by my gambling disorder. In 1991, I hope they'll see that I came clean about my 
problems, got help and stayed out of trouble," he said today. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Rose's 24-year baseball career was when he surpassed Cobb's 
long-time record with 4,256 base hits. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has consistently denied betting on baseball or on his own team -- offenses 
punishable by banishment from the game under baseball rules.

Robin Stith, attorney for Bertha Douglas, said Douglas alleges gross neglect of 
duty and incompatibility. Neither Douglas nor his manager, John Johnson, could 
be reached for comment. Johnson's son and executive assistant, John Johnson II, 
said the Douglas camp will not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Stith said Douglas filed for divorce Wednesday in Franklin County Domestic 
Relations Court. She said Bertha Douglas will contest it. "Mrs. Douglas and I 
have not yet figured out what our strategy will be. But we're going to protect 
her interests. That's for sure," Stith said. "My client doesn't want a 
divorce."

Bob Heddleston, a University of Pittsburgh assistant athletic director and the 
school's top athletic fund-raiser, resigned today after being accused of 
forging a $300 check made out to a part-time cheerleading coach. 
</P>
<P>
Heddleston's resignation came after an internal audit was initiated "following 
a review of circumstances surrounding an alleged check forgery," Pitt Executive 
Vice President Jack Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant director of athletics for development, Heddleston ran the Golden 
Panthers, the athletic department's fund-raising arm, since 1976. He was 
credited with raising about $15 million for athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said today in a statement that on Nov. 9, Pitt Athletic Director Edward 
Bozik learned that a check made out to Mike Nuzzo, the school's assistant 
cheerleading coach, "might have been improperly endorsed and cashed through a 
third party by Heddleston." 
</P>
<P>
The check was reimbursement for a personal appearance, arranged by Heddleston, 
that the cheerleaders made at Chauncy's, a Pittsburgh bar. It has not been 
determined why the check was made out to Nuzzo rather than the cheerleaders.

EXPERTS SPLIT ON JAIL TIME FOR PETE ROSE

Legal experts were divided today over whether Pete Rose will have to serve jail 
time for his income tax offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total wild card. You never know what the outcome is going to be," 
former Abscam prosecutor Thomas P. Puccio said. "There is no usual thing. The 
tendency has been to treat each one of these cases on its own facts. If you 
commit a bank robbery, you go to jail. With tax charges, it's not so clear." 
</P>
<P>
Rose pleaded guilty today to filing false federal income tax returns for 1985 
and 1987. He could get up to six years in prison and a $500,000 fine, but U.S. 
District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel probably will not sentence him for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose was a legend and a hero to so many of us baseball fans. But if he 
seriously violated our tax laws, he should not be treated like a legend but 
like anybody else and face the prospect of hard jail time," New York state 
Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel queen Leona Helmsley took her tax case to trial last year and was 
sentenced to four years and fined $7.1 million. However, she was convicted on 
33 counts -- including conspiracy, evasion and fraud charges -- and was accused 
of avoiding $1.8 million in taxes. Rose admitted under-reporting his income by 
$354,968 over a four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
"My own view is that neither Pete Rose nor Leona Helmsley belongs in jail," 
said Harvard Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz, Helmsley's appellate 
lawyer. "But whatever the appropriate sentence is in this should be equally 
applicable to a fallen baseball hero as well as to the wife of a hotel chain 
magnate. 
</P>
<P>
"If he ends up getting a lesser sentence than she got, a think a lot of 
Americans will regard it as sexist justice and improper justice. My hope is 
that neither serve any time in prison. I think both have been punished enough 
by the public outcry and the public scrutiny of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Steven B. Duke, a law professor at Yale, thinks Rose probably will do time. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the position of the Justice Department that tax evaders should go to 
jail," Duke said. "It would be rather hard for a judge to say that an exception 
should be made here. But it wouldn't be outrageous for him not to go to jail. 
Maybe weekends or something like that."

With the unexpected entry of College Green, the field for Saturday's Grade III

Brian Sweeney, the co-owner and trainer of College Green, said he had entered 
the Kentucky-bred colt in the La Puente Stakes (a 1 1/8-mile race run Wednesday 
at Santa Anita) but removed him from the field when they took the race off 
grass.

<P>
"I decided to scratch and send him to the California Derby," Sweeney said. 
"He's been training well, and so we'll take a chance."

College Green is expected to be a long shot in the Cal Derby, also run over 1

STYLE: VETERAN FASHION CONSULTANT SAYS SHE SHOOTS FROM THE HIP; 
</P>
<P>
FROM A 'NINE O'CLOCK MASS' PRODUCTION TO A TOGA SHOW, KITTY LESLIE IS KNOWN FOR 
HER FEISTY AND IRREVERENT STYLE 
</P>

<P>
Backstage in a conference room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, 
models in various stages of dress sift through piles of clothes, makeup, shoes 
and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Away in a nearby ballroom, members of the Hoag Hospital Auxiliary finish their 
desserts and await the start of their annual fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
It's a scene that fashion show veteran Kitty Leslie has played over and over. 
</P>
<P>
She's standing among the models, a recognizable figure with her cropped brown 
hair and large glasses, steering the action like a film director on a Hollywood 
set. 
</P>
<P>
"Kitty, do you want the plain navy pump or this spectator?" asks a lanky model 
holding up two shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The spectator -- it goes well with that nautical look," Leslie says. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want my hair up or down?" asks a blonde with a curly mane. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to be very Gatsby-ish," Leslie says, wrapping a scarf around her 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"Kitty, how do I get these pants to fit?" asks a male model from behind a 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Roll them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Just before show time, Leslie coaches three models she has dressed in leopard 
spots for her opening safari number. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get out on stage, look like animals," she says. "I really mean it. 
Ham it up a little." 
</P>
<P>
As the fashion consultant for Fashion Island in Newport Beach, Leslie produces 
about 40 fashion shows a year for philanthropic and cultural organizations. She 
will juggle seven shows this month, a typical load for the busy spring season. 
</P>
<P>
Her big productions, such as the Laguna Philharmonic Committee's fashion show 
this afternoon at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, have all the trappings of a 
Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
She has lights and music, dancers, a cast of models, and her costumes -- 
clothes she pulls from Fashion Island stores. Leslie narrates the shows 
herself, without a script. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I invented the show. I know where the clothes came from. If I didn't, I'd 
fake it. But I do know." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's shows always have a theme. 
</P>
<P>
"A fashion show needs a gimmick. It needs some reason for being," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She hates the idea of bunching the clothes together by color. 
</P>
<P>
When she did a show for a Catholic church group, for example, she found "a 
bunch of dumb dresses" that did not fit in with the overall theme. In an 
inspired move, she called the segment "Nine o'Clock Mass." Her Catholic 
audience loved it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a parade of fashion," she says. "My shows have a definite story. 
I don't just show merchandise. Every group relates to the group in front or 
back. It must have a theme, whether it's to launch a fragrance or highlight a 
movie or a tune." 
</P>
<P>
Often she plays off a theme chosen by the charity group. The Laguna 
Philharmonic selected "An Affair to Remember" for its fund-raiser and specified 
that the show have 15 models and "no young, funky clothes." So Leslie decided 
to base the show on "Casablanca," with a Moroccan set, wafting music and 
romantic suits. 
</P>
<P>
In fashion circles, Leslie is known for her feisty, irreverent style. She's her 
harshest critic. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to shoot from the hip, and that's unfortunate," she says. She tore up 
her check after one show when she inadvertently insulted a model wearing a 
large-sized dress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a deadly serious commentator. I'm likely to say, 'Where the hell do 
you think she'd wear that?' or 'Those stripes are optical illusions -- this 
model actually weighs 300 pounds.' " 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, 64, discovered her affinity for fashion early. She left college to work 
as a Girl Friday and then copywriter for Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 18 years old and drunk with power," she jokes. 
</P>
<P>
She later jumped from store to store, learning all phases of marketing and 
promotion along the way. She produced fashion shows for Bullock's in South 
Coast Plaza and Neiman Marcus in Fashion Island before becoming a fashion 
consultant for Fashion Island seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she's been so swamped with requests for shows that the center 
formed a committee to determine which shows it would sponsor. The Laguna 
Philharmonic, for instance, represents the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
and proceeds from its show will help sponsor music-related activities for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's eye for fashion helps her choose an artful blend of conservative and 
trendy clothes for her productions. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Hoag show, she makes her rounds at the mall with a clothes 
rack in tow. At Red Haute Couture, she spots a collection of leopard tops and 
leggings. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's my safari opening!" she says. 
</P>
<P>
At Mondi, she finds exotic vests, harem pants and wrap jackets in curry and 
raspberry colors, then she's off to Robinson's to pick up a Ralph Lauren 
collection that features a long tan suede skirt, jodhpurs and a colorful Navaho 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
"The older women will hate the jodhpurs, but they'll love the long skirt." 
</P>
<P>
Merchants don't like to loan out merchandise more than two days before a show, 
so she often rushes around gathering clothes with her assistant Lois Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I just eyeball it and grab it the night before." 
</P>
<P>
As she organizes the clothes into groups, the show takes shape in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"A good show begins with good merchandise. The lighting, the music, the staging 
is fluff. If you have good merchandise, you can't go wrong. You can put it on 
bad models and get away with it. The opposite is also true. You can put a bad 
outfit on a great model. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain girls I know will sparkle." 
</P>
<P>
The models respect Leslie as much for her professional attitude as her dry wit. 
Some have worked with her for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to you?" she asks a model who shows up late to the Hoag show. 
</P>
<P>
"I was partying too much," the woman says sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have my sympathy -- you have my envy," Leslie responds. 
</P>
<P>
She relies on a team of backstage dressers, most of them volunteer students 
from Saddleback College, who help get the models on the runway on cue. 
</P>
<P>
For a big show like the Laguna Philharmonic, she works with a producer, Carlton 
Burnett, to prepare an opening dance number. The pair have launched elaborate 
productions, borrowing ideas from musicals such as "The Phantom of the Opera" 
and "Cats." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie frequently surprises. At a Bill Blass trunk show for Bullock's, she 
hired a team of models before discovering that the designer wanted to show his 
sheets and towels. 
</P>
<P>
"So I wrapped togas around the models and we used shower rings for bracelets," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Blass, who was initially appalled at the idea, loved the show and so did the 
audience. The sheets and towels sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Theatrics come naturally to Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in a film can," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her father worked as a publicist for silent film director D.W. Griffith before 
becoming publicity director for 20th Century Fox. Her mother worked as 
Griffith's private secretary. Lillian Gish is her godmother. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm as much in show business as they were," Leslie says. "Only my shows 
never close." 
</P>

WHAT'S NEXT FOR JAMES BROWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Sixteen months have passed, and James Brown is still a prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 15, 1988, Soul Brother No. 1 became inmate No. 155413 and has since 
been required to spend his days behind bars in the minimum security State Park 
(S.C.) Correctional Institute. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, Brown began participating in a county work-release program 
that will place him back out in the community, acting as a spokesman for the 
Aiken and Barnwell Counties Community Action Commission. Under the terms of the 
release agreement, Brown must return each night after work to the Lower 
Savannah Work Center, a minimum security facility in the town of Aiken. His 
belongings were transferred there last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Brown is not being freed," explained Francis X. Archibald, Director of 
Public Affairs for the South Carolina Department of Corrections in a telephone 
interview. "He is just moving from one phase of incarceration to another." 
</P>
<P>
If Brown does well during this first phase of work release, Archibald said that 
the 56-year-old soul singer may qualify to become eligible for extended work 
release by July. In extended work release, Brown would continue working for the 
county, but would be allowed to live at an approved residence within the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday from the Aiken and Barnwell Counties 
Community Action Commission, the imprisoned entertainer sounded upbeat and 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Moses did when he led the children out of Pharaoh's land, like one 
of the disciples. I love this job and I'm just trying to do the right thing," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to provide help where help is needed. I'll be giving speeches and 
working with the poor and less fortunate. Maybe if people see the good that 
we're doing in this beautiful city, it will send a message to the world." 
</P>
<P>
The community action agency was one of several prospective employers who 
offered Brown a job. According to his lawyer, Richard Crane, Brown chose his 
current minimum-wage position over a teaching job at Benedict College, a 
musical consultant gig on Arsenio Hall's television show and several openings 
at Aiken radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
His daily activities will include community appearances designed to draw public 
attention to the problems of the poor and homeless in and around Aiken. He will 
also give talks at local high schools intended to encourage underprivileged 
young people to stay off drugs and in school, Crane said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many are in need of help. Poor people out on the street, kids on drugs, 
pregnant teens, the elderly," Brown said with fervor. "We need to start paying 
attention to the condition of these people, figure out how they got in that 
position in the first place, and help them to help themselves. This is not just 
about civil rights anymore, it's about human rights." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he was especially looking forward to participating in an upcoming 
benefit being staged at the University of South Carolina to generate income for 
the Aiken and Barnwell Communities Action Commission. Scheduled to take place 
on May 3, in celebration of Brown's 57th birthday, the event will feature 
performances by Brown, Ray Charles, Gladys Knight, Teddy Riley, Little Richard, 
Heavy D. &amp; the Boyz, Jermaine Jackson and Full Force. 
</P>
<P>
He also voiced enthusiasm over a documentary being prepared about his life by 
the Washington-based film production company On the Potomac. Thomas Hart, the 
firm's president, described the 60-minute production as a retrospective of 
Brown's career, with interview excerpts, footage from his incarceration and 
concert performances from the May 3 tribute. Hart said negotiations were under 
way with three networks to air the special in late May or early June. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is has long been one of the most influential artists in pop music. He not 
only invented the genres of funk and rap, his syncopated imprint also helped 
define the pulse of rock, fusion and world music. 
</P>
<P>
Often referred to as "the Godfather of Soul" and "the Hardest Working Man in 
Show Business," Brown is also legendary for his intense stage performances. 
Over the course of his career, he has visited with Presidents, congressmen, 
foreign dignitaries and was called in to quell rioting in Augusta, Boston and 
Washington following the assassination of Martin Luther King. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's imprisonment came on the heels of a spree of allegedly violent episodes 
and erratic behavior. In the summer of 1988, the Augusta, Ga., resident was 
placed on probation after being convicted of assault and battery involving a 
police officer. Other violations that year included carrying a pistol and PCP 
possession, to which Brown pleaded no contest. In the fall, he checked into a 
drug rehabilitation program for four days. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 24, 1988, Brown, armed with a shotgun, entered an insurance seminar in 
Augusta. Participants at the seminar notified local authorities, setting into 
motion a high-speed car chase in the Augusta area and across the state line in 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
According to South Carolina police, Brown attempted to run over two officers 
trying to set up a roadblock, so they shot out the front tires of his truck. 
Police said he drove six miles on the rims before stopping in a ditch. But in 
court, Brown told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
He denied ever attempting to run anybody over and maintained that he was in the 
process of surrendering to a black officer when a group of white policemen 
arrived on the scene and began breaking out the windows in his vehicle. Fearing 
for his life, Brown said he drove off as the white officers opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from the Aiken County Sheriff's Department on 
Wednesday, Officer Donald Danner, the black officer who participated in Brown's 
arrest, agreed with Brown's version of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was unethical what the officers did," Danner said. "As far as I'm 
concerned, the sentence he received was far too severe. It was more than 
anybody has ever gotten for what he did." 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced in South Carolina on Dec. 15, 1988, to six years and six 
months in prison for failure to stop for an officer and aggravated assault. He 
is also serving concurrently a six-year Georgia sentence after pleading guilty 
to a number of misdemeanor charges. According to his lawyer, he is not 
technically eligible for parole until next March. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Crane, a specialist in corrections and sentencing law, was hired by 
Brown in July to explore ways of obtaining his release from custody. Crane was 
instrumental in negotiating the conditions of the current work release program. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on my experience, Mr. Brown's six-year sentence was clearly excessive," 
Crane said. "It is certainly not the typical sentence nationally. But I don't 
want to get into lambasting the system here. There is no point in aggravating 
anyone unnecessarily." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, once bitter about the events surrounding his imprisonment, insisted he 
was too busy to look back now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to the concert and the upcoming documentary. We're 
looking forward to helping the less fortunate. We're no longer interested in 
using the type of language ad concepts that put us in yesterday's news," Brown 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think talking about the past is one of the things that hurt the civil rights 
movement so much. Sure, it's nice to know about yesterday, but it's better to 
understand today and have a plan for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
He said his new job is just an extension of what he's been trying to accomplish 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of an uphill fight for total involvement. You see, I was there 30 
years ago. I've been there. You're talking to the first black man who ever 
owned three radio stations, the only black man who ever owned four jets. The 
first black man to crusade against drugs in the '60s, back when everybody was 
afraid to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking to the first black man who paid for scholarship funds at 36 
different black colleges. The black man who the record company officials told 
it was crazy to (record) 'Don't Be a Dropout.' The one they told you can't tell 
kids to go to school. That's who you are talking to, and I'm still at it. I'm 
still trying to keep kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still the same James Brown. Nothing has changed. So let's not talk about 
yesterday. Let's talk about what we intend to do tomorrow. Then, maybe we can, 
as we say, do some soul stirring and get ourselves together."

TEACHERS UNION ELECTS BERNSTEIN PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles teachers union members have voted overwhelmingly to elect union 
Vice President Helen Bernstein as their new leader. 
</P>
<P>
She will take the reins of United Teachers-Los Angeles in July from President 
Wayne Johnson, who headed the nation's second-largest teachers union for six 
years, leading it through a bitter nine-day strike last spring. Johnson was 
precluded by union rules from running for another term. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, a high school counselor and history teacher, has been the union's 
leading advocate for the school restructuring process negotiated during the 
strike and now under way in the district's 600 schools. 
</P>
<P>
She won nearly 65% of the vote, with about 12,000 of the union's 28,000 members 
casting ballots during the three-week-long election. Ballots were counted this 
week and results will be formally certified and announced by the union's board 
of directors next week, said union spokeswoman Catherine Carey. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, whose low-key style is a marked departure from the confrontational 
demeanor of her predecessor, said she has intends to stay the course Johnson 
has charted for the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a different style and I've taken on different issues than Wayne, but I 
have the same priorities he does," Bernstein said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
She called her lopsided victory over three opponents "as much an endorsement of 
Wayne and what he has stood for in this union as a mandate for me." 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne went out of his way to endorse me," she explained, "and people voted for 
me on the assumption that I would continue to push on the priority that we have 
had as a union in the past few years -- that the district's money is not spent 
in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
After three terms as president, Johnson plans to return to the classroom this 
fall but will continue to serve on the union's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's confrontational style has led to a bitter relationship between the 
union and the district, but that may change some under Bernstein, who has had 
to work closely with district officials in getting school-based management off 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jackie Goldberg said she looks forward to working with 
Bernstein and has been impressed by her commitment to the school restructuring 
process. "I know she is completely dedicated to that and that will certainly be 
an area of agreement for us." 
</P>
<P>
But Bernstein said she plans to go even further in pushing for teacher 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to restructure the entire district, from the superintendent's office 
on down," she said. "Our school system is in crisis: The schools are not 
properly supplied, we don't have the resources to compete in this technological 
world, the curriculum is not responsive to the multicultural, multilinguistic 
needs of our children. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles native and graduate of Hamilton High School, Bernstein, 45, began 
teaching history in 1967 at Sun Valley Junior High School in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
She has a bachelor's degree from UCLA and a master's degree in counseling from 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was elected to the union board in 1987 and to the vice president post 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected union vice presidents are Day Higuchi, Denise Rockwell, Nina 
Greenberg and John Perez. Jerry Folender was elected treasurer.
